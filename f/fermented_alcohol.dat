50|$|Zozu is an {{alcoholic}} beverage {{similar to a}} beer and locally made by the Zomi (the Zo people), in northwestern Myanmar (Chin State, Myanmar). This <b>fermented</b> <b>alcohol</b> is usually made with maize, rice or other grains that are available.|$|E
50|$|Often, casta {{paintings}} depicted commodity {{items from}} Latin America like pulque, the <b>fermented</b> <b>alcohol</b> drink {{of the lower}} classes. Painters depicted interpretations of pulque that were attributed to specific castas. Pulque abuse was shown in some casta paintings as a social criticism of the lower castas, and the Spanish desire for regulation over pulque consumption and distribution.|$|E
50|$|Drinking {{alcohol is}} often {{correlated}} with a season's passing and its related farming activities. Once the harvest has ended farmers would spend their downtime brewing and <b>fermenting</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{as they looked}} forward to the spring.|$|R
50|$|Traditional vinegars {{are made}} by <b>fermenting</b> <b>alcohol</b> (wine, {{in the case of}} wine vinegar; cider for cider vinegar, and an ale made from malted barley in the case of malt vinegar).

50|$|In 1796, {{with the}} aid of an encyclopedia, Boston {{produced}} the first <b>fermented</b> <b>alcohol</b> beverage made at Sydney, which sold for 1s 6d (1 shilling, 6 pence). The corn beer, being made by Boston, was brewed from properly malted maize and bittered with the leaves and stalks of the love apple, (Lycopersicum, a species of Solanum), or as it was more commonly called in the settlement, the Cape gooseberry. Boston found this succeeded so well, that he erected at some expense a building for the business and was, engaged in brewing and making soap.|$|E
5000|$|In November 2005 Switzerland {{passed its}} [...] "Food and Commodities Regulation" [...] (German: Lebensmittel- und Gebrauchsgegenständeverordnung), {{introducing}} {{a ban on}} alcohol sales to anyone {{under the age of}} 16, although the 1980 passed [...] "Alcohol Law" [...] (German: Alkoholgesetz) already required a minimum age of 18 years for the retail sale of distilled spirits. Therefore, it is illegal to sell <b>fermented</b> <b>alcohol</b> (e.g. beer, wine, sparkling wine or cider) to anyone under the age of 16, and any distilled alcoholic beverages to anyone under the age of 18 years. Further the canton of Ticino introduced a contonal law in 1989 banning all alcohol sales to anyone under the age of 18 years.|$|E
50|$|The {{production}} of mind-altering commodities {{was an important}} source of profit for entrepreneurs and the Spanish administration. Tobacco as a commodity was especially important {{in the late eighteenth century}} when the crown created a monopoly on its production and processing. Demand by the urban poor for local {{production of}} pulque, the <b>fermented</b> <b>alcohol</b> from agave cacti, made it profitable, so that large-scale cultivation, including by Jesuit landed estates, met demand; the crown regulated taverns where it was consumed. Coca, the Andean plant now processed into cocaine, was grown and the unprocessed leaves consumed by indigenous particularly in mining areas. Production and distribution of coca became big business, with non-indigenous owners of production sites, speculators, and merchants, but consumers consisting of indigenous male miners and local indigenous women sellers. The church benefited from coca production since it was by far the most valuable agricultural product and contributor to the tithe. Most high quality textiles were imported from Europe via the transatlantic trade controlled by Iberian merchants, but Mexico briefly produced silk. As demand for cheap textiles grew, production for a growing local mass market took place in small-scale textile workshops (obrajes), which had low capital inputs, since the expansion of sheep ranching provided a local supply of wool, and low labor costs, with obrajes functioning in some cases as jails. Spanish America is most noted for producing dyes for European textile production, in particular the red dye cochineal, made from the crushed bodies of insects that grew on nopal cactuses, and indigo. Cochineal was for Mexico its second most important export after silver, and the mechanisms to engage indigenous in Oaxaca involved crown officials and urban merchants. The blue dye indigo was another important export, particularly from Central America.|$|E
50|$|Succinate can {{alternatively}} {{be formed}} by reverse activity of SDH. Under anaerobic conditions certain bacteria such as A. succinogenes, A. succiniciproducens and M. succiniciproducens, run the TCA cycle in reverse and convert glucose to succinate through the intermediates of oxaloacetate, malate and fumarate. This pathway is exploited in metabolic engineering to net generate succinate for human use. Additionally, succinic acid produced during the fermentation of sugar provides {{a combination of}} saltiness, bitterness and acidity to <b>fermented</b> <b>alcohols.</b>|$|R

40|$|Wild yeasts on {{the surface}} of various fruits {{including}} grapes were surveyed to obtain yeast strains suitable for fermenting a novel wine with higher alcohol content and supplemented with rice starch. We considered selected characteristics, such as tolerance to alcohol and osmotic pressure, capability of utilizing maltose, and starch hydrolysis. Among 637 putative yeast isolates, 115 strains exhibiting better growth in yeast-peptone-dextrose broth containing 30 % dextrose, 7 % alcohol, or 2 % maltose were selected, as well as five α-amylase producers. Nucleotide sequence analysis of the 26 S rDNA gene classified the strains into 13 species belonging to five genera; Pichia anomala was the most prevalent (41. 7 %), followed by Wick-erhamomyces anomalus (19. 2 %), P. guilliermondii (15 %), Candida spp. (5. 8 %), Kodamaea ohmeri (2. 5 %), and Metschnikowia spp. (2. 5 %). All of the α-amylase producers were Aureobasidium pullulans. Only one isolate (NK 28) was identified as Sac-charomyces cerevisiae. NK 28 had all of the desired properties {{for the purpose of this}} study, except α-amylase production, and <b>fermented</b> <b>alcohol</b> better than commercial wine yeasts...|$|E
40|$|In 1996, a self-imposed ban on {{broadcast}} advertisements by {{the major}} hard liquor distillers ended. Some federally licensed broadcast outlets ended up accepting and airing advertisements for distilled liquor products such as rum and vodka while others refused. This dissertation 2 ̆ 7 s main purpose is to study the variation found in broadcasters 2 ̆ 7 willingness to air alcoholic beverage commercials and to test different explanatory models for the divergence of reactions to these controversial products. In December 1997, 191 radio station general managers completed a mailed survey about their policy on alcohol advertising and specifically answered questions about what types of alcohol beverage ads they had accepted or would accept. Some would take all. The vast majority reported that they would accept such <b>fermented</b> <b>alcohol</b> products as beer and wine, but not for distilled liquor products. Others indicated that their stations refused all alcoholic beverage advertisements and would even refuse to air ads for nightclubs. An index of willingness to air alcoholic beverages and related products became the main dependent variable for the study. An analysis of the research literature suggested ethical, economic and audience factors would best account for the observed variation in station managers 2 ̆ 7 alcohol clearance decisions. Each factor was explored using statistical analysis. Stations with a religious format were unlikely to air commercials for alcohol products as were stations {{with a history of}} format stability. Younger general managers with a business-oriented educational background were the most likely to accept advertisements for alcohol-related products and businesses. However, the most powerful variable in explaining the differences in clearance of these controversial advertisements was found to be the ethical values of the manager, including his or her concern for the audience. Remarkably, the station 2 ̆ 7 s economic and technical conditions did not have much predictive value. No strong evidence was found for a hypothesis that alcoholic beverage advertisements are price discriminated against by stations; that is, these advertisers are charged a higher price by stations because of controversial content. ...|$|E

5|$|The Iazyges used hanging {{barrel-shaped}} pots {{that were}} asymmetrical, and had uneven weight distribution. The rope to hang the pot was {{wrapped around the}} edges of the side collar, it is believed that the rope was tied tightly to the pot, allowing the pot to spin in circles, due to the spinning motion, several theories have been made of the use of the pots. It is believed that the smaller hanging pots were used to <b>ferment</b> <b>alcohol,</b> by use of the seeds of touch-me-not balsam (Impatiens noli-tangere), and the larger hanging pots were used to churn butter and make cheese. They were cattle breeders, and as such required salt in order to preserve their meat, however, the Iazyges had no salt mines within their land. According to Dio, the Iazyges received grain from the Romans.|$|R
25|$|Chaptalization is {{the process}} of adding sugar to {{unfermented}} grape must in order to increase the alcohol content after fermentation. The technique is named after its developer, the French chemist Jean-Antoine-Claude Chaptal.

50|$|The {{fermentation}} starter, {{known in}} Chinese as Jiuqu or simply as Qu, {{is usually a}} dried cake of flour cultured with various molds, yeasts and bacteria. In the production of Huangjiu it is crushed and added to inoculate the cereal substrate to initiate fermentation into liquor. The various molds and filamentous yeasts found in Jiuqu exude enzymes that digest the substrate into sugars that are in turn, <b>fermented</b> into <b>alcohol</b> by other yeasts and bacteria.|$|R
5000|$|Sake (lead=yes) ( [...] ), also spelled saké, ( [...] or [...] ) also {{referred}} to as a Japanese rice wine, is made by fermenting rice that has been polished to remove the bran.

This method kills the yeast responsible for fermentation. He then sold his new product as “Dr Welch's Unfermented Wine”. In late 18th century United States, circulation of foreign fruit juices were heavily regulated by tariffs. The McKinley Tariff Act of 1890 increased import takes from 38 to 49.5 percent, and set taxes on fruit juices based on the alcohol content of the drink. Juices with 18% or less alcohol were taxed 60 cents per gallon, while anything above 18% was taxed $2.50 per proof gallon.|$|R
