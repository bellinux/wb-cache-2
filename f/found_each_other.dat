5|$|Some {{women were}} able {{to arrive at the}} {{recruiting}} station in a man's suit, deny ever having been in love with another woman, and be easily inducted. Sexual activity, however, was forbidden, and blue discharge was almost certain if one identified oneself as a lesbian. As women <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> they formed into tight groups on base, socialized at service clubs, and began to use code words. Historian Allan Bérubé documented that homosexuals in the armed forces either consciously or subconsciously refused to identify themselves as homosexual or lesbian, and also never spoke about others' orientation.|$|E
5|$|These were no easy years, again, {{as former}} Afrikaner compatriots <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{on two sides}} of the {{political}} fence, in a rapidly changing world. As in his earlier life, Reitz remained a man of outspoken convictions, which he aired freely. As such, he came into conflict with the Smuts government, and in 1920 he was not re-appointed as president of the Senate. He did remain a member of that House until 1929, however.|$|E

25|$|Sanborn {{became a}} close friend of philosopher and fellow poet Santayana, with whom he {{graduated}} in the class of 1886. Freshmen were seated alphabetically, so the two <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> side-by-side in several classes in addition to sharing in the editorship of Harvard literary magazines and membership in several social groups, which included Art Club, Chess Club, the OK Society and the Everett Atheneum. In December 1885, they shared the stage in the Hasty Pudding Theatrical, Robin Hood, followed by the production Papillonetta the following spring. Sanborn's interest in history led him to win the Bowdoin Prize for a dissertation on The Rights and Duties of a Biographer in his junior year. As a graduating senior, he was selected to write the class ode and presented it as part of the festivities on Class Day.|$|E
25|$|In autumn 1903 Childers {{travelled}} to the United States {{as part of}} {{a reciprocal}} visit between the Honourable Artillery Company of London and the Ancient and Honorable Artillery Company of Massachusetts of Boston. At the end of the official visit he elected to remain and explore New England on a hired motor cycle. One day by chance the machine broke down outside the Beacon Hill home of Dr Hamilton Osgood, a prominent physician in the city. Childers diffidently knocked to borrow a spanner and was invited in for dinner and introduced to Dr Osgood's younger daughter, Mary ("Molly") Alden Osgood. The well-read republican heiress and Childers <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> congenial company. Dr Osgood organised the rest of Childers's stay, with much time shared with Molly, and the pair were married at Boston's Trinity Church on 5 January 1904.|$|E

When Jake confesses that he is heartbroken, Bill {{mentions}} {{that he has a}} daughter who is single but Jake declines. While drinking coffee with Sarah later, Bill quotes something that Jake said to him and Sarah realizes that Jake was talking about her. She heads over to Jake's with Mother Teresa, but he is out on the lake with his boat. When Jake can't hear her yelling from the shore she convinces a girls crew team to take her out to him. Eventually she dives in and swims over to his boat. After climbing in Sarah tells Jake how she feels about him and they kiss. Later, when telling the story of how they met, they mention in unison that they <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> at a dog park.|$|E

25|$|For {{the most}} part, Zaire enjoyed warm {{relations}} with the United States. The United States was the third largest donor of aid to Zaire (after Belgium and France), and Mobutu befriended several US presidents, including Richard Nixon, Ronald Reagan, and George H. W. Bush. Relations did cool significantly in 1974–1975 over Mobutu's increasingly radical rhetoric (which included his scathing denunciations of American foreign policy), and plummeted to an all-time low {{in the summer of}} 1975, when Mobutu accused the Central Intelligence Agency of plotting his overthrow and arrested eleven senior Zairian generals and several civilians, and condemned (in absentia) a former head of the Central Bank (Albert N'dele). However, many people viewed these charges with skepticism; in fact, one of Mobutu's staunchest critics, Nzongola-Ntalaja, speculated that Mobutu invented the plot as an excuse to purge the military of talented officers who might otherwise pose a threat to his rule. In spite of these hindrances, the chilly relationship quickly thawed when both countries <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> supporting the same side during the Angolan Civil War.|$|E
500|$|Alexander Charles Wood (an {{undergraduate}} whose tutor was Peacock) wrote from Cambridge to {{his cousin}} FitzRoy to recommend Darwin. Around midday on Sunday 4 September Wood received FitzRoy's response, [...] "straightforward and gentlemanlike" [...] but strongly against Darwin joining the expedition; both Darwin and Henslow then [...] "gave up the scheme". Darwin went to London anyway, and next morning met FitzRoy who {{explained that he}} had promised the place to his friend Mr. Chester, (possibly the novelist Harry Chester) but Chester had turned it down in a letter received not five minutes before Darwin arrived. FitzRoy emphasised the difficulties including cramped conditions and plain food. Darwin {{would be on the}} Admiralty's books to get provisions (worth £40 a year) and, like the ship's officers and captain, would pay £30 a year towards the mess bill. Including outfitting, the cost to him was unlikely to reach £500. The ship would sail on 10 October, and would probably be away for three years. They talked and dined together, and soon <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> agreeable. The Tory FitzRoy had been cautious at the prospect of companionship with this unknown young gentleman of Whig background, and later admitted that his letter to Wood was [...] "to throw cold water on the scheme" [...] in [...] "a sudden horror of the chances of having somebody he should not like on board". He half-seriously told Darwin later that, as [...] "an ardent disciple of Lavater", he had nearly rejected Darwin on the phrenological basis that the shape (or physiognomy) of Darwin's nose indicated a lack of determination.|$|E

When forced to fight each other, Ferdiadh mentions their sharing beds, and {{they are said to}} have <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> after the first day of conflict and kissed. After three days, Cúchulainn defeats Ferdiadh by piercing his anus with his [...] "mysterious weapon" [...] Gáe Bulg. The tale has led to comparisons to Greek [...] "warrior-lovers", and Cúchulainn's reaction to the death of Ferdiadh in particular compared to Achilles' lament for Patrocles.|$|E

2500|$|Kiedis {{attended}} Fairfax High School in Los Angeles, {{where he}} struggled to find friends as he had recently transferred to a new school district. However, he soon met Flea, and after a brief confrontation, the two became best friends and bonded while sitting {{next to each other}} in driver's ed class. Kiedis recalled, [...] "We were drawn to each other by the forces of mischief, love, and The Grateful Dead. We became virtually inseparable. We were both social outcasts. We <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{and it turned out to}} be the longest-lasting friendship of my life." [...] Kiedis became a significant influence on Flea, exposing him to rock music, particularly punk rock. [...] Kiedis and Flea began jumping into swimming pools from buildings as a hobby. At age 15, Kiedis broke his back attempting to jump into a swimming pool from a five-story building, missing the pool by a few inches. [...] His back has since improved, although he still has occasional problems.|$|E
2500|$|... "From {{more than}} hundred goals that I scored I'm sure that over 50 were {{assisted}} by Michael. To {{play with him}} was extremely easy. We <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> by intuition {{on the field and}} found common football language. Look at Ivan Zamorano. Laudrup went there (Real) and Zamorano is a goalscorer. Sometimes I envy Ivan for the passes he receives. Passes on foot after you accelerated. Few people understand football like the Danish player. He can only be comprised with Maradona, Schuster or Roberto Baggio. They make things easy and find the right solutions. For them is simple, for the opponent– unthinkable. Phenomenal! His only problem is his character. He is emotional and terribly reserved. This affects him a lot, because he takes everything personally– no matter if someone tells him something or decision that he does not agree. His relations with Cruyff were delicate because he couldn't take the critics. I listen to him but I don't care that much. For Michael this was fatal. He couldn't take it anymore so he left without a word." ...|$|E
2500|$|Flea, who {{was then}} nicknamed Mike B. the Flea, {{attended}} Fairfax High School, and was somewhat of an outcast due to his taste in music. However, he soon met Anthony Kiedis, and after a brief confrontation, the two became best friends. Kiedis recalled: [...] "We were drawn to each other {{by the forces of}} mischief and love and we became virtually inseparable. We were both social outcasts. We <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> {{and it turned out to}} be the longest-lasting friendship of my life." [...] Flea was turned on to rock music by Hillel Slovak, and particularly punk rock by Anthony Kiedis. Originally a jazz trumpet player, Flea learned to play bass from Slovak, who shortly after asked him to be a bassist in his band, Anthym. Flea soon developed his own style and joined the group, but quit several months later in order to play for the punk rock outfit Fear. He then rejoined Slovak to form an intended one-off band: Tony Flow and the Miraculously Majestic Masters of Mayhem along with Kiedis and Jack Irons, all of them at the time inspired by the free funk band Defunkt and the hip hop act Grandmaster Flash and The Furious Five.|$|E

50|$|P. cattleyanum {{is often}} {{associated}} with invasive feral pigs The two species are often <b>found</b> near <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> most likely because feral pigs aid in the spread of P. cattleyanum. The pigs disturb habitats by digging in the soil, making it easier for P. cattleyanum seeds to reach the soil. Additionally, feral pigs may ingest the fruits, whose seeds reach the soil in the scat of the feral pigs.|$|R

Now you know that I am an honest man, and you are mad against me, as I am against you. Yes, that's it. You can't be angry with bad men. But a good man in the wrong--why one thirsts for his blood.

2500|$|Tommy grows {{dissatisfied}} with the Jaffes, feeling {{that they are not}} helping him. Seeking out other possibilities, Tommy ends up abandoning and undermining the Jaffes by introducing Albert to Caterine Vauban (Isabelle Huppert), a former student of the Jaffes who espouses a seemingly opposing nihilistic/absurdist philosophy. She teaches them to disconnect their inner beings from their daily lives and their problems, to synthesize a non-thinking state of [...] "pure being." [...] Being lifted from their troubles, they wish to keep that feeling forever, yet she tells them that it is inevitable to be drawn back to the human drama, and to understand that the core truth of that drama is misery and meaninglessness. In order to prove her point, Caterine takes Albert to go and have sex in the woods, leaving Tommy behind. Tommy finds out about the two of them being together and feels hurt. Caterine tells him that they <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other</b> through all of the human suffering and drama. Tommy rejects this idea and leaves them furious and lost. Meanwhile, in Brad's further attempts to undercut Albert, he and Dawn meet with and are influenced by Bernard and Vivian. In the following days, Brad and Dawn rethink their entire lives: Dawn rejects the modeling world and looks for deeper meaning, and Brad realizes that his whole ascent on the corporate ladder is meaningless, as he has lived his whole life just trying to please others and not himself.|$|E

Bergman {{said that it was}} [...] "only appropriate" [...] that the couple <b>found</b> <b>each</b> <b>other,</b> explaining: [...] "Wherever Sharon goes, she is embarrassed. Will Phyllis come walking around the corner? But Sharon doesn't have any reason to be embarrassed with Jack." [...] However, Bergman also noted that Jack's intamicy with her [...] "all happens so quickly" [...] which could indicate he was up to something manipulative. Case praised the marriage as being a good representation of modern-day marriages. Additionally, she felt that Sharon had [...] "lost her identity" [...] after divorcing Nick and Cassie's death, and found a new one in her marriage to Jack. Nick and Sharon remained close despite their separate marriages. In 2007, Nick ended up in a plane crash, losing his memory. When he returned, he thought it was 2005, believing he was married to Sharon and Cassie was alive. He even kissed Sharon; but regained his memory and returned to Phyllis and their infant daughter, Summer. Phyllis became jealous of Sharon's place in Nick's life, prompting her to write an article in their magazine Restless Style, in which she described Sharon as a [...] "needy" [...] "gum-chewing twit" [...] who twirls her hair. Nick was angry at Phyllis for berating the mother of his children, although it was evident that he still loved Sharon and was protective of her. Stafford said: [...] "He [...] Freaks. She wrote this scathing thing. But Nick says it's not appropriate for her to go after the mother of his son like that," ...|$|E
