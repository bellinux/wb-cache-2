5000|$|A spider die {{consists}} of an internal mandrel connected to the outer <b>die</b> <b>wall</b> by several [...] "legs", and is a moderately complex design. The resulting film will feature weld lines wherever legs were present. These weld lines are weaker than the surrounding polymer, and may also have different optical characteristics, such as haze. This weakness is caused by incomplete healing of the polymer molecular matrix. Furthermore, a pressure gradient produced by the spider legs will cause nonuniform die swell, resulting in nonuniform film thickness.|$|E

[...] The dies themselves are {{almost identical to}} those used in blown film extrusion; the only major difference is {{the gap between the}} inner mandrel and outer <b>die</b> <b>wall.</b> Once the polymer melt is extruded from the die, it is pulled away by take-up rollers. Cooling is accomplished through the use of water baths, or a large number of cooling fans. After cooling, the tube is either wound onto large spools (if flexible), or cut into pre-set lengths and stacked (if stiff).|$|E

50|$|Tablet {{formulations}} {{are designed}} and tested using a laboratory machine called a Tablet Compaction Simulator or Powder Compaction Simulator. This {{is a computer}} controlled device that can measure the punch positions, punch pressures, friction forces, <b>die</b> <b>wall</b> pressures, and sometimes the tablet internal temperature during the compaction event. Numerous experiments with small quantities of different mixtures can be performed to optimise a formulation.Mathematically corrected punch motions can be programmed to simulate any type and model of production tablet press. Initial quantities of active pharmaceutical ingredients are very expensive to produce, and using a Compaction Simulator reduces the amount of powder required for product development.|$|E
5000|$|Unlike in blown film, pipe, and sheet {{extrusion}}, {{the dies}} used in profile extrusion are rarely round or completely flat. Whereas a round (or flat) profile has uniform flow rates along all edges, {{this is not}} the case for more complex shapes. Take, for instance, the example of a simple, solid, square profile. The velocity of the melt is highest at the center of the die, and slowest at the edges and corners due to friction between the melt and die walls. When moving from the center of the die to the midpoint of one of the edges, the velocity gradient is high, especially near the outer <b>die</b> <b>wall.</b> However, when moving from the center to one of the corners, the velocity gradient is more gradual. As a result, the extruded square profile will experience more die swell at the edges than the corners, causing the once square profile to become more circular. This can be compensated for by bowing in the sides of the die so it approximates the shape of a four-pointed star; the sides of the polymer melt will now swell to the intended dimensions.|$|E
50|$|The {{processes}} used {{to manufacture}} orally disintegrating tablets include loose compression tabletting, {{a process which}} is not very different than the manufacturing method used for traditional tablets and lyophilization processes. In loose compression, ODTs are compressed at much lower forces (4 - 20 kN) than traditional tablets. However, since ODTs are compressed at very low forces due {{to the need to}} them to be soft enough to disintegrate rapidly in the mouth, issues of material sticking to the die walls can be challenging. Typically, as in most tablet blends, lubricants such as magnesium stearate are added to the blend {{to reduce the amount of}} material that may stick to the <b>die</b> <b>wall.</b> Differences may be the use of disintegrating aids, such as crospovidone, and binding agents that aid in mouth feel, such as microcrystalline cellulose. Primarily, ODTs contain some form of sugar such as mannitol, which typically serves as the major diluent of the ODTs, and is also the primary contributor to the smooth and creamy mouth feel of most ODTs. Lyophilized ODT formulations may use proprietary technologies but can produce a tablet that has a faster disintegration rate, for example the Zydis ODT typically dissolves in the mouth in less than 5 seconds without water. ODTs are available in HPDE bottles (Parcopa) or individually sealed in blister packs to protect the tablets from damage, moisture, and oxidation. Because ODTs are soft in nature, the ability to successfully package an ODT in a bottle is difficult. However, CIMA Labs markets their Durasolv ODT as being able to be placed into bottle for commercial sale, while CIMA's Orasolv is marketed for blisters only. Zydis ODT tablets manufactured by Catalent Pharma Solutions are delivered in a blister pack. The differences between the two CIMA products are proprietary, however, the primary difference is expected to be the use of microcrystalline cellulose (MCC), such as Avicel PH101, in the Durasolv product. MCC serves multiple purposes in an ODT but in the case of CIMA's products, it acts as a binder, increasing the internal strength of the tablet and making it more robust for packaging in bottles.|$|E

Secondly, the homogeneous mixture is {{poured into the}} die. Then, 4 tons of pressure is gently applied on the die.

It is to be noted that the pressure is slowly lowered to prevent incarnating the air mass among the particles, which causes some cracks on the samples.|$|R

40|$|The {{achievement}} of high density at reasonable {{cost would be}} a definite advantage {{for the production of}} P/M components requiring high static and dynamic properties. The use of the electrostatic <b>die</b> <b>wall</b> lubrication technique appears as a very attractive route to promote desification. by reducing the level of friction at die walls, this techniques should have the potential to also reduce density variations in powder compacts, particularly for parts having a large sliding surface or a long die fill.

40|$|ABSTRACT: The {{study is}} {{concerned}} with the quantitative measurement of changes in friction, surface roughness, and tensile strength during the compaction of Ficus deltoidea powder, a well-known Malaysian herb. In the compaction process, the force applied for compaction (upper punch) was greatly influenced by the friction between <b>die</b> <b>wall</b> and powder bed during transmission to the lower punch. Wall friction was found to increase with the increasing load and weight of powder due to an increase in surface contact with the <b>die</b> <b>wall.</b> The coefficients of wall friction decreased from 0. 47 to 0. 36 for increasing weight of powder from 0. 8 – 1. 5 g. Tablets with a higher compaction load of 9. 5 kN had a lower arithmetic mean deviation (Ra), an indicator of surface roughness. Ra for the top surface is lower than that of for the bottom surface...|$|E

40|$|The {{rheological}} behavior of fluoroelastomer high-density polyethylene (HDPE) blends {{was investigated in}} detail. A capillary rheometer {{was used to determine}} the apparent viscosity of the blends as a function of time at various shear rates. The time to attain the steady state and the normalized steady-state apparent viscosity of the blends depend on shear rate and the fluoroelastomer concentration. The reduction in the apparent viscosity is caused by adhesive failure at the interface between the HDPE melt and the fluoroelastomer layer which was formed on the <b>die</b> <b>wall</b> surface during the extrusion of the blends. The presence of the fluoroelastomer layer on the <b>die</b> <b>wall</b> surface was confirmed by x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy and rheological measurements. Based on our previous work and this work, we have discovered that {{there are at least two}} different mechanisms-adhesive failure at the interface between the extrudate and the lubricating layer or cohesive failure in the lubricant layer-for viscosity reduction in polymer blends.

40|$|A Drucker-Prager/cap {{constitutive}} model, {{where the}} elastic and plastic model parameters are {{expressed as a}} function of relative density (RD), was presented in a companion article 17 together with experimental calibration procedures. Here, we examine the RD distribution in curved-faced tablets with special reference to the <b>die</b> <b>wall</b> lubrication conditions. The compaction of powders is examined using finite element analysis, which involves the following factors: constitutive behavior of powder, friction between powder and tooling, geometry of die and punches, sequence of punch motions, and initial conditions that result from die fill. The predictions of the model are validated using experimental RD maps. It is shown that different <b>die</b> <b>wall</b> lubrication conditions induce opposite density distribution trends in identical tablets (weight, height, and material). The importance of the internal tablet structure is illustrated with respect to break force, failure mode, and friability: it is demonstrated that for a given average tablet density the break force and failure mode are not unique. Also, tablet regions having lower density locally have higher propensity for damage. The applicability of finite element analysis for optimizations of formulation design, process development, tablet image, and tool design is discussed...|$|E
40|$|International audienceDifferent {{computational}} {{methods are}} nowadays active research topics in computational mechanics. Different strategies have been proposed, the main challenge being always the computing cost induced by complex problems exhibiting multiple degrees of freedom. In this paper we present the Proper Generalized Decompositions or PGD, {{a way of}} addressing an efficient solution for multidimensional problems [1]. Moreover, we will apply this technique {{on the design of}} dies. The optimal choice of the design parameters, in our case the temperatures prescribed on different regions of the <b>die</b> <b>wall,</b> is a difficult task. In general some values are chosen for the thermal simulations performed. Then a cost function is evaluated and the temperatures are modified in order to reduce such function. Obviously, for each choice of the temperatures prescribed on the different regions of the die walls, a thermal problem must be solved. Thus, optimization becomes too expensive from the computation time point of view. The PGD allows solving only once a thermal model for any temperature prescribed on the different regions of the <b>die</b> <b>wall.</b> Optimizations as well as inverse identification become an easy matter...|$|E
