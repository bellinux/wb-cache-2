The empirical study is performed using a VAR approach with the application of aggregated data of EU 15 over the period 1995 to 2012. The results provide the evidence that the reactions of greenhouse gas emission and <b>gross</b> inland <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> to the shocks of environmental policy instruments are strong, mainly in the short term and decay to zero after about 8 years. Further, the reactions of the environmental policy instruments to the shocks of greenhouse gas emission and <b>gross</b> inland <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> are also strong in the short term, however with the deferred effects. In addition, the results show that government spending on environmental protection together with <b>gross</b> inland <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> has stronger effect on greenhouse gas emissions than environmental taxes in EU 15 over the examined period.

5000|$|Renewable energy {{consumption}} more than quadrupled from 48 PJ in 1990 to 203 PJ in 2015. Whilst renewable {{energy consumption}} was rising between 1990 and 2013 <b>gross</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> actually fell by 7%. Most {{of the fall}} {{can be attributed to}} a great increase in combined power and heat generation (CHP) and the growth in wind power. This has increased energy conversion efficiency, reducing conversion losses by 28% or 7% relative to <b>gross</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption.</b> Put simply smaller and decentralised CHP plants use fuels far more efficiently than older centralised power plants, and wind power has no fossil fuel to waste. Thus the growth of these two sources (10% during the period) has displaced fossil fuels by more than a one-to-one ratio. The use of Biofuels in local CHP plants has further displaced fossil fuel consumption. The figures in the table above show that whilst the reduction in fossil fuel use has been most pronounced in coal use, there has also been a significant reduction in oil and natural gas usage since 2000. Oil has fared better than the other fuels because it still dominates usage in the transport sector and alternative fuels and transport solutions are not yet widely deployed.

50|$|Italy had a 17% {{renewable}} energy target in its total energy use {{set by the}} European Union for 2020 and had already exceeded this target by 2014, reaching 17.1%. Gross final energy consumption from renewables rose from 17.36 Mtoe in 2010 to 21.14 Mtoe {{by the end of}} 2015. Most of the growth occurred in the electricity sector which increased by 58.3%. The thermal sector registered a much smaller rise of 5.7% whilst the transport sector showed a fall of 16.9%. Italy's overall {{renewable energy}} target for 2020 was effectively met by 2014. However this is partially due to a reduction in total <b>gross</b> <b>energy</b> <b>consumption</b> from all sources and if it were to rise again the overall percentage target of renewable energy could fall short without some further expansion in sources.
