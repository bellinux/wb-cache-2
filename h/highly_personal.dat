5|$|The three sonatas are {{cyclically}} interconnected by diverse structural, harmonic and melodic elements tying {{together all}} movements in each sonata, {{as well as}} all three sonatas together; consequently, they are often regarded as a trilogy. They also contain specific allusions and similarities to other Schubert compositions, such as his Winterreise song cycle; these connections point to turbulent emotions expressed in the sonatas, often understood as <b>highly</b> <b>personal</b> and autobiographical. Indeed, some researchers have suggested specific psychological narratives for the sonatas, based on historical evidence concerning the composer's life.|$|E
5|$|We {{know more}} about Lancaster's {{character}} than of most of his contemporaries through his memoirs, the Livre de seyntz medicines (Book of the Holy Doctors). This book is a <b>highly</b> <b>personal</b> treatise on matters of religion and piety, but it also contains details of historical interest. It, among other things, revealed that Lancaster, {{at the age of}} 44 when he wrote the book in 1354, suffered from gout. The book is primarily a devotional work though; it is organised around seven wounds which Henry claims to have, representing the seven sins. Lancaster confesses to his sins, explains various real and mythical medical remedies in terms of their theological symbolism, and exhorts the reader to greater morality.|$|E

5|$|Henry of Grosmont, 1st Duke of Lancaster, 4th Earl of Leicester and Lancaster, KG (c. 1310 â€“ 23 March 1361), also Earl of Derby, was {{a member}} of the English nobility in the 14th century, and a {{prominent}} English diplomat, politician, and soldier. The son and heir of Henry, 3rd Earl of Lancaster, and Maud Chaworth, he became one of Edward III's most trusted captains in the early phases of the Hundred Years' War and distinguished himself with victory in the Battle of Auberoche. He was a founding member and the second Knight of the Order of the Garter in 1348, and in 1351 was created duke. An intelligent and reflective man, Grosmont taught himself to write and was the author of the book Livre de seyntz medicines, a <b>highly</b> <b>personal</b> devotional treatise. He is remembered as one of the founders and early patrons of Corpus Christi College, Cambridge, which was established by two of the guilds of the town in 1352.|$|E
5|$|Eleanor's son Elliott {{authored}} numerous books, {{including a}} mystery series in which Eleanor was the detective. However, these murder mysteries were researched and written by William Harrington. They continued until Harrington's death in 2000, {{ten years after}} Elliott's death. With James Brough, Elliot also wrote a <b>highly</b> <b>personal</b> book about his parents called The Roosevelts of Hyde Park: An Untold Story, in which he revealed details about the sexual lives of his parents, including his father's relationships with mistress Lucy Mercer and secretary Marguerite ("Missy") LeHand, as well as graphic details surrounding the illness that crippled his father. Published in 1973, the biography also contains valuable insights into FDR's run for vice-president, his rise to the governorship of New York, and his capture of the presidency in 1932, particularly {{with the help of}} Louis Howe. When Elliott published this book in 1973, Franklin Delano Roosevelt Jr. led the family's denunciation of him; the book was fiercely repudiated by all Elliot's siblings. Another of the siblings, James, published My Parents, a Differing View (with Bill Libby, 1976), which was written in part as a response to Elliot's book. A sequel to An Untold Story with James Brough, published in 1975 and titled A Rendezvous With Destiny, carried the Roosevelt saga to the end of World War II. Mother R.: Eleanor Roosevelt's Untold Story, also with Brough, was published in 1977. Eleanor Roosevelt, with Love: A Centenary Remembrance, came out in 1984.|$|E

In 1854 his son George Inness, Jr., who also became a landscape painter of note, was born in Paris.|$|E

40|$|In todayâ€Ÿs world {{automation}} is encompassing {{virtually every}} walk {{of life and}} human control functions are delegated to technical equipment. No doubt this results in emerging requirement of <b>highly</b> reliable <b>personal</b> identification system for authenticated access of resources and to reject imposters. Traditional password based verification systems can be easily hacked when a password is divulged to an unauthorized user. A number of biometric techniques have been proposedfor personal identification by various researchers. Biometric includes something which one {{does not need to}} remember or carry a token. Biometric based personal authentication systems use physiological or behavioral traits of a person for recognition purpose. Physiological traits include fingerprint, face, hand geometry etc. and behavioral traits are speech, handwriting, key strokes etc. During past few years, there has been remarkable growth in biometric recognition technology due to the increasing requirement of <b>highly</b> reliable <b>personal</b> identification and authentication in a number of government and commercial applications. In this paper we present a comparative study of various biometric recognition techniques suggested for authentication purpose and to reject imposters...|$|R
25|$|Femme au Chapeau or Woman with a Hat is an oil {{painting}} created circa 1906 by the French artist and theorist Jean Metzinger (1883â€“1956). The work is executed in a <b>highly</b> <b>personal</b> Divisionist style with a marked Proto-Cubist component {{during the height}} of Fauvism. Femme au Chapeau exhibits a presentiment of Metzinger's subsequent interest in the faceting of form associated with Cubism. The painting now forms part of the collection of the Korban Art Foundation.|$|E
25|$|The two operas of Schoenberg's pupil Alban Berg, Wozzeck (1925) and Lulu (incomplete at {{his death}} in 1935) share {{many of the same}} {{characteristics}} as described above, though Berg combined his <b>highly</b> <b>personal</b> interpretation of Schoenberg's twelve-tone technique with melodic passages of a more traditionally tonal nature (quite Mahlerian in character) which perhaps partially explains why his operas have remained in standard repertory, despite their controversial music and plots. Schoenberg's theories have influenced (either directly or indirectly) significant numbers of opera composers ever since, even if they themselves did not compose using his techniques.|$|E
25|$|Mouthpiece {{selection}} is a <b>highly</b> <b>personal</b> decision. Thus, a symphonic trombonist might prefer a mouthpiece with a deeper cup and sharper inner rim shape {{in order to}} produce a rich symphonic tone quality, while a jazz trombonist might choose a shallower cup for brighter tone and easier production of higher notes. Further, for certain compositions, these choices between two such performers could easily be reversed. Some mouthpiece makers now offer mouthpieces that feature removable rims and cups allowing players to further customize and adjust their mouthpiece to their preference.|$|E
