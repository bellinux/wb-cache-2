40|$|Although it is {{currently}} popular to reflect consumers' perspectives to <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> management, insufficient {{attempts have been made}} to understand detailed perception of the consumer side of <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> to promote <b>medical</b> services' evaluation from the consumer viewpoint. The aim of this study was to descriptively reveal how consumers perceive <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> that they receive, focusing on inpatient <b>medical</b> <b>services.</b> We conducted semi-structured interviews with 10 adults who experienced hospitalization of five or more days. Constant comparative analysis was performed on the obtained descriptive data. We identified 1) medical procedures, 2) explanations from medical professionals, 3) behavior of <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> providers, 4) somatic sensations, and 5) self-perceived physical conditions as target factors that <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> consumers perceived during hospitalization. The response to the perceived target factors, "compared with the expectation that the consumer had before the hospitalization," suggests that it is an important <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> consumer reaction to check if the service met their expectations for perceived factors. The response to the <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> perception targets suggested that <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> consumers are involved in <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> and interested in various perception targets. The expectations that <b>medical</b> <b>service</b> consumers have prior to hospitalization can largely influence inpatient <b>medical</b> <b>services</b> evaluation...|$|R
