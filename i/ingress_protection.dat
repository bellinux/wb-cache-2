50|$|Raisbeck began {{developing}} bulletproof {{doors and}} bulkheads for Boeing 737s and 757s in 2000 (before the September 11-mandated FAA requirement). Four {{weeks after the}} September 11, 2001 attacks, the first of Raisbeck's prototype Hardened Cockpit Security System was installed. Alaska Airlines, American Trans Air and other airlines operating the Boeing 737 immediately ordered and took delivery of the cockpit doors. The doors included rapid decompression, emergency pilot egress and crash-crew cockpit <b>ingress,</b> bulletproof <b>protection,</b> cockpit-to-cabin visual identification and structural integrity. In March 2002 Raisbeck turned over its flight deck security business and customers to Boeing.|$|R
40|$|Gives {{definitions}} {{for standard}} degrees of protection provided by enclosures; protection of machines against harmful effects {{due to the}} <b>ingress</b> of water; <b>protection</b> of machines against ingress of solid foreign objects; Protection of persons against contact with or approach to live parts and against contact with moving parts. Gives designations for these protective degrees and tests to verify that the machines meet the requirements...|$|R
50|$|For IEC member countries, {{standard}} IEC 60529 is classifying the <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> rating (IP Codes) of enclosures.|$|E
5000|$|IEC 60320-2-3: Couplers with {{a degree}} of {{protection}} higher than IPX0 specifies couplers with some degree of liquid <b>ingress</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Sony {{releases}} the Sony Xperia Tablet Z {{as well as}} having <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> Ratings of IP55 and IP57, making it dust-resistant, water-jet resistant, and waterproof.|$|E
50|$|Within zone 0, no {{devices are}} allowed apart from {{suitable}} equipment and or insulated pull cords. Previously, in zone 1, only separated extra low voltage (SELV) devices were permitted. Any AC transformer supplying such a device must be located outside zones 0-2. Since {{the introduction of}} the 17th edition of the IET Wiring Regulations in 2008, 230V fixtures such as light fittings and extractor fans are permitted in zones 1 and 2, subject to those fixtures meeting the appropriate <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> ratings. The minimum required <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> rating in zone 0 is IPX7 and IPX4 in zone 1 and 2. If water jets are likely to occur, at least IPX5 is required in zone 1-3. Otherwise, in zone 3 and beyond, an <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> rating of IP20 is the minimum required. Equipment in zones 1 and 2 must be protected by a 30 mA residual current device (RCD).|$|E
50|$|The {{inclusion}} of an <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> rating {{has become increasingly}} common {{for use in the}} consumer electronics market with devices such as mobile phones, tablet computers and cameras now being sold as water resistant, waterproof and dustproof.|$|E
50|$|Another {{common mistake}} with home-made {{adapters}} {{is to use}} two cables into a connector which is only designed for a single cable, possibly resulting in poor electrical connection, poor mechanical attachment at the strain relief, and/or inadequate <b>ingress</b> <b>protection.</b>|$|E
50|$|For {{swimming}} pools, Section 603 of BS 7671 defines similar zones. In some {{of these}} zones, only industrial sockets according to IEC 60309 are permitted, in order to discourage the use of portable domestic appliances with inappropriate <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> rating.|$|E
50|$|The {{combination}} of both <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> ratings and MIL-STD 810 has provided the ruggedised consumer market an extra dimension to consider when marketing products towards those who enjoy outdoor recreation, extreme sports as well as manual workers in skilled trades.|$|E
50|$|Cable entry {{systems are}} used for routing {{electrical}} cables, corrugated conduits or pneumatic and hydraulic hoses into switch cabinets, electrical enclosures, control panels and machines or in large heavy-duty vehicles, rolling stock and ships. Possible requirements can be high <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> rates or integrated strain relief.|$|E
50|$|Shocks can {{be caused}} by direct or {{indirect}} contact. Contact with an exposed conductive part under fault conditions is called direct contact. IEC requires certain degrees of <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> against direct contact. Indirect contact protections can be achieved by earthed equipotential bonding and automatic disconnection of supply by using Residual Current Devices, for example.|$|E
50|$|The Samsung Rugby Smart (SGH-i847) was a {{ruggedized}} Android smartphone {{manufactured by}} Samsung, {{for use on}} the AT&T Mobility network. The phone was 4G capable, but lacked LTE support. It was dust and vibration resistant, as well as waterproof {{to a depth of}} 1 m for 30 minutes, earning the phone an <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> rating of IP67.|$|E
50|$|The IP Code, International Protection Marking, IEC {{standard}} 60529, sometimes {{interpreted as}} <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> Marking, classifies and rates {{the degree of}} protection provided against intrusion (body parts such as hands and fingers), dust, accidental contact, and water by mechanical casings and electrical enclosures. It is published by the International Electrotechnical Commission (IEC). The equivalent European standard is EN 60529.|$|E
50|$|First {{announced}} at CES 2013, the Xperia ZR is a mid range smartphone with a 4.55 inch screen, 2GB of RAM, Quad core processor. The smartphone also has <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> Ratings of IP55 and IP58, making it dust protected, low pressure water jet protected, and waterproof. It {{was released on}} 17 May 2013 in Japan where it is marketed as the 'Xperia A'.|$|E
50|$|Several {{independent}} {{tests have}} been conducted to determine the resistance of Toughbook computers to external forces. Fully rugged Toughbook models undergo independent lab testing to become certified to meet MIL-STD-810 standards for operation {{in a range of}} extreme conditions. Fully rugged models are also tested for particle resistance and liquid resistance and are rated according to international standards for <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> (IP).|$|E
5000|$|Roxtec {{delivered}} a fire proof cable seal solution {{for one of}} the UK's largest chemical manufacturing plants, BASF, bio-acrylamide chemical plant in Bradford. The frame was bolted into concrete, and standard Roxtec products were modified to seal power and earth cables entering the cable pit and motor control centre (MCC). The BASF system was specially designed to deliver passive fire and <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> with a 60-minute fire integrity ring.|$|E
5000|$|Boundaries among PDA, {{smartphone}} and EDA can be blurred {{when comparing}} the {{wide array of}} common features and functions. EDAs attempt to distinguish themselves with a pre-defined requirement for long term constant daily operation (Normally allowing a minimum of 8 hours). They seek a higher than normal impact rating / drop test rating and an <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> rating of no less than IP54, Most {{have at least one}} Data Collection function i.e. a Barcode or RFID Reader etc.|$|E
50|$|Xplore Technologies is a {{publicly}} traded, designer, marketer and manufacturer of rugged tablets. The company {{was founded in}} 1996 and is based in Austin, Texas. In 2015, Xplore Technologies purchased assets of Motion Computing {{making it one of}} the top companies in the rugged tablet PC market. The company's products are primarily used by field service personnel, factory workers and military personnel. Xplore Technologies products are built to satisfy MIL-STD-810G and HAZLOC compliant ATEX standards, as well as <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> (IP) ratings.|$|E
50|$|Before {{the advent}} of the IK code, a third numeral had been {{occasionally}} added to the closely related IP Code on <b>ingress</b> <b>protection,</b> to indicate the level of impact protection — e.g. IP66(9). Nonstandard use of this system was one of the factors leading to the development of this standard, which uses a separate two numeral code to distinguish it from the old differing systems. The standard came into effect in October 1995 and conflicting national standards had to be withdrawn by April 1997.|$|E
5000|$|IPxx rating: The <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> rating or IP Code classifies {{and rates}} {{the level of}} {{protection}} provided against the ingress of solid foreign objects (first digit) or water (second digit), a higher digit means greater protection. In the US the NEMA enclosure type is used similarly to the international rating. Most inverters are rated for outdoors installation with IP45 (no dust protection) or IP65 (dust tight), or in the US, NEMA 3R (no windblown dust protection) or NEMA 4X (windblown dust, direct water splash and additional corrosion protection).|$|E
50|$|The {{phone was}} {{announced}} by Sony at CES 2013 {{and was released}} on 9 February 2013 in Japan and 1 March 2013 in Singapore and the UK. The Xperia Z was initially shipped with the Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) operating system. The smartphone has <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> Ratings of IP55 and IP57, making it dust protected, low pressure water jet protected, and waterproof, which allows for immersion under 1 metre of water for up to 30 minutes, and features a 13.1 MP Exmor RS camera sensor {{as well as a}} full HD (1080p) display, encompassed in Sony's 'Omni-Balance' Design.|$|E
50|$|While various {{ranges of}} {{smartphones}} do offer {{protection against the}} elements, they aren't always protected against drops and can still break easily when dropped onto hard surfaces. Due to this, the need for ruggedised mobile phones has also increased significantly with specialist manufacturers like Bullitt Group and TUFF Phones offering devices that combine both <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> ratings and MIL-STD 810G standards which protect against a range of environmental conditions such as Low Pressure (altitude), High and Low Temperature Variations, Contamination by Fluids, Solar Radiation (Ultraviolet and direct exposure to sunlight), Humidity, Salt Fog, Sand and Dust.|$|E
50|$|For routing of {{standard}} cables and other electrical, pneumatic or hydraulic lines through machine, panel or enclosure walls, cable glands, self-sealing grommets or cable entry plates {{can be used}} to seal the cut-outs required for passing the cables through. This protects the inside of an enclosure or machine from dirt, dust or liquids.Cable glands and self-sealing grommets are usually designed for entering single or just a few cables. By utilising a cable entry plate, many cables with different diameters can be routed. Depending on the type, very high packing densities or <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> classes up to IP 67/68 (according to IEC 60529) can be achieved.|$|E
50|$|The {{phone was}} {{announced}} by Sony at CES 2013 {{and was released}} on 17 May 2013 in Japan. The Xperia ZR was initially shipped with Android 4.1.2 (Jelly Bean) and has been updated to Android 5.1.1 recently. The smartphone has <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> Ratings of IP55 and IP58, making it dust protected, low pressure water jet protected, and waterproof. Sony's internal test showed {{that there are no}} water intrusion after testing Xperia ZR in 1.5-metre of water for 30 minutes. Xperia ZR also features a 13 MP IMX135 Exmor RS camera sensor as well as a HD (720 x 1280 pixels) display, encompassed in Sony's Industrial 'Omni-Balance' Design.|$|E
50|$|The Sony Xperia Tablet Z is a 10.1-inch tablet {{manufactured}} by Sony. First announced in Japan, the tablet was then announced globally in Barcelona at the Mobile World Congress on February 25, 2013. Weighing 1.09 pounds (495 grams) and just 0.27 inches (6.9 mm) thick, {{it is the}} thinnest and lightest 10-inch tablet in the world. Succeeding the Xperia Tablet S, the Xperia Table Z comes with a faster processor, a better front-facing camera, a higher-resolution screen, and <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> Ratings of IP55 and IP57, for dust-protected, water-jet protected, and waterproof in up to one meter of water for up to thirty minutes. The tablet was released in May 2013.|$|E
50|$|For routing cables {{which are}} already {{assembled}} with connectors, split cable entry {{systems have been}} developed. The divisibility of these systems provides two advantages. The warranty on pre-terminated cables remains since the connectors don’t have to be cut and soldered again after entering the cables. The other advantage is that assembly can be done subsequently because the split cable entries are usually built around the existing lines.Most split cable entries consist of a split hard frame, made of plastic or sometimes aluminium (e.g. utilised in food industry) and one or several split sealing grommets, usually made of elastomer. The grommet matching the cable diameter is placed around the cable and fixed inside the cable entry frame. Thus allowing strain relief for the cables (in some cases according to EN 50262) as well as <b>ingress</b> <b>protection</b> of up to IP 65/66/67.|$|E
50|$|The Xperia Tablet Z is a {{touchscreen}} Android tablet {{designed and}} manufactured by Sony and was first announced in Japan in January 2013. It was then announced globally in Barcelona at the Mobile World Congress on February 25, 2013. The tablet {{is one of}} the lightest and thinnest 10.1-inch tablet in the world with a weight of 1.09 pounds (495 grams) and is just 0.27 inches (6.9 mm) thick. The Tablet Z succeeds the Xperia Tablet S with a faster processor, a better front-facing camera, a higher-resolution screen, and <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> Ratings of IP55 and IP57, for dust-protected, water-jet protected, and waterproof in up to one meter of water for up to thirty minutes. It was released in May 2013. The device retails at $500 for the 16GB (Wi-Fi only) version and $600 for the 32gb (Wi-Fi only) version.|$|E
5000|$|The verykool {{line was}} {{launched}} in 2006 by InfoSonics Corporation, a publicly traded company that operated as a telecommunication product distributor since 1994. The company was a distributor of products supplied by Samsung, VK Corporation, LG, Novatel and others. InfoSonics Corporation ceased its distribution business in 2012 and became solely a manufacturer of its own product line. [...] InfoSonics began shipping its first line of verykool products to Central America in 2007. This included the verykool i500 and i230 wireless handsets. The verykool product line was expanded in 2013 {{with the release of}} the verykool s350 and the verykool RS75. The RS75 is part of the verykool rugged line of mobile phones. It is a dust and waterproof phone with an <b>Ingress</b> <b>Protection</b> rating of IP67 and tempered, scratch-resistant glass display. InfoSonics also began marketing its mobile devices in the United States in 2013 due to the demand of inexpensive unlocked phones. That same year InfoSonics released the verykool s470, also called the Black Pearl. The Black Pearl is comparable to the Moto X from Motorola Mobility with a 1.2 GHz processor and 4.7-inch screen. It also includes Dual SIM technology allowing users to switch between two SIM cards within the phone. It is compatible with GSM carriers like AT&T, T-Mobile and overseas GSM networks, and was called an alternative to the Nexus 5 by Mobile Tech Reviews.|$|E
