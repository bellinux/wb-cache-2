5|$|A {{key element}} of the {{gameplay}} is its focus on guns over swords and magic. When deciding upon the game's basics, the team {{wanted to create a}} cinematic feeling in battles. If they <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> a more traditional battle system, then it would have quickly lost its cinematic quality due to the prevalence of close combat. Likewise, they wanted the cinematic feel to persist throughout the whole game rather than restricted to cutscenes. A major challenge was {{to strike a balance between}} accessibility and difficulty when developing for a player base that might be made of up of both action game and RPG players. This resulted in the addition of strategy elements. Another wish was to create something new and fresh in the RPG market. When creating the gameplay style, the team looked at action movies such as The Matrix and Rebellion during their research. Despite its fast-paced action, the game relies heavily upon strategic, turn-based gameplay. During early development, the game was based on a real-time system and meant for only one character to be controlled by the player; the other two would have been handled by the game's artificial intelligence (AI). After some testing, they decided that this would create unwanted difficulties in gameplay such as characters dying off-screen without the player noticing or the AI not directing them properly.|$|E
25|$|With the {{gap between}} the end of the Confederate {{defensive}} line southwest of Petersburg and Pickett's force at Five Forks in mind, on March 30, Lee made additional deployments to strengthen the Confederate right flank. Lee would have moved men from Longstreet's force north of the James River but largely due to demonstrations and deceptions by the remaining divisions of Major General Godfrey Weitzel's XXV Corps (Twenty-Fifth Corps), Longstreet thought that he still confronted Ord's entire Army of the James almost three days after Ord <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> the XXIV Corps, a division of the XXV Corps and Mackenzie's cavalry to the Union lines south of Petersburg.|$|E
25|$|Those {{who made}} their way up through the Valtournanche {{to the foot of}} the {{mountain}} were few in number. W. A. B. Coolidge, a diligent collector of old and new stories of the Alps, mentions that during those years, besides Brockedon, only Hirzel-Escher of Zürich, who crossed the Theodul Pass in 1822, starting from Breuil, accompanied by a local guide. The greater number came from the Valais up the Visp valley to Zermatt. In 1813, a Frenchman, Henri Maynard, climbed to the Theodul Pass and made the first ascent of the Breithorn; he was accompanied by numerous guides, among them J. M. Couttet of Chamonix, the same man who <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> de Saussure to the top of the Klein Matterhorn in 1792.|$|E

To <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> him anywhere--honestly to <b>have</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> him--trusting to honest love and a true heart.

25|$|In 1954 (even with Cassady now a {{seasoned}} junior) the Buckeyes were picked to finish {{no higher than}} 5th in the Big Ten. Athletic Director Dick Larkins, a Hayes defender, hired Lyal Clark back from Minnesota, where he <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> Fesler, to coach the Buckeye defense, allowing Hayes to concentrate on offense and easing the pressure Hayes inevitably put on his assistants. That season no opponent scored more than two touchdowns on the Buckeyes, and seven of the ten were held to a touchdown or less. An 88-yard interception return by Cassady against second-ranked Wisconsin and a 4th quarter goal-line stand inside its own one-yard line against Michigan propelled Ohio State to a perfect season that included a 20–7 victory over USC in the Rose Bowl. Woody Hayes won his first and the team's second national championship.|$|E
25|$|Jerry Atkins, Booker's band leader, had {{arranged}} with the girl's parents {{to take her}} to and from the dances, taking turns with bandmate Ernie Holcomb. It was Holcomb's turn that night, but he said Booker told him that she had a ride with an old friend. Atkins was awakened the next morning at 6:00 with a telephone call. It was a female asking if he knew where Booker was. He had no knowledge of Booker's change of plans and told the caller that Holcomb took her home, but he was informed she had been expected at a party but never came. Atkins received a similar call around 8:00 from another girl, and he asked if she had checked with Booker's parents. This girl told him that Booker <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> a friend named Paul but neither had attended the party.|$|E
25|$|Independent TD Maureen O'Sullivan accused Ahern of {{attempting}} {{in his autobiography}} {{to take credit for}} the Gregory deal by claiming he was present in negotiations between Charles Haughey and Tony Gregory and that he had provided Haughey with estimates from Dublin City Council. The Gregory deal was an agreement negotiated between the independent socialist TD Tony Gregory and Fianna Fáil leader Charles Haughey {{in the aftermath of the}} February 1982 general election, which resulted in a hung Dáil. In return for supporting Haughey, Gregory was promised a deal worth 100 million pounds at the time, which was to be used to redevelop North Inner City Dublin and to provide a greater number of houses and employment in an area which was considered Ireland's poorest and most disadvantaged. Ahern <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> Haughey to the negotiations with Gregory; he was immediately asked to leave by Gregory and was forced to wait publicly in his car outside for three and a half hours. Although both had been elected to the same constituency, they were fierce rivals and the relationship between them was often sour. O'Sullivan was Tony Gregory's director of elections and successor as a TD.|$|E

500|$|Alf {{first saw}} Julia Stanley at the 'Trocadero' club, a {{converted}} cinema on Camden Road, Liverpool. Although {{he did not}} speak {{to her at the}} time, he later saw Julia again in Sefton Park, where he <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> a friend to meet girls. Alf, who was dressed in a bowler hat and holding a cigarette holder, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench. The 14-year-old Julia said that his hat looked [...] "silly", to which the 15-year-old replied that Julia looked [...] "lovely", and sat down next to her. Julia asked him to take off his hat, so he promptly took it off and threw it straight into the lake.|$|E
500|$|Parr's fame for {{severity}} {{spread a}} sort of panic through the city, especially among the mothers, who would sometimes interpose a remonstrance, which occasioned a ludicrous scene, but seldom availed the culprit, while the wiser were willing to leave their boys in his hands. Richard Twining, the tea merchant, however, was advised by his brother John to send his eldest son to Norwich, writing of Parr, [...] "I {{have been told that}} he flogs too much, but I doubt those from whom I have heard it think any use of punishment too much". Parr's daily teaching was interrupted at midday when he sent a boy to the pastry-cook's across the road for a pie, which he ate by the schoolroom fire. On the resignation of his headship in 1785, historian Warren Derry comments, [...] "an object of terror was gone, but the glory of the place <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> it".|$|E
500|$|Alfred 'Freddie' Lennon—always called 'Alf' by his family—was always joking {{but never}} held {{a job for}} very long, preferring to visit Liverpool's many {{vaudeville}} theatres and cinemas, where he knew the usherettes by name.

Lennon, who {{was dressed in a}} bowler hat and with a cigarette holder in hand, saw [...] "this little waif" [...] sitting on a wrought-iron bench.

500|$|Bouvet {{had been}} driven {{offshore}} in his flagship Immortalité during the storm, and when the wind fell during 29 December he decided to abandon the operation. Signalling to the ships within view, he ordered his remaining squadron to sail southeast towards Brest. Some ships failed to receive the message and continued to the second rendezvous off the River Shannon, but they were few and scattered and in the continuing storms no landing was possible. With provisions running low, these ships also turned and sailed for Brest, as the weather worsened once more. As their expeditionary force sailed home, Morard de Galles and Hoche arrived in Bantry Bay on 30 December, discovering that the fleet <b>had</b> <b>gone.</b> <b>With</b> their own provisions almost exhausted, Fraternité and Révolution were forced to return to France as well. The British response to the attempted invasion continued to be inadequate, Colpoys arriving at Spithead on 31 December with only six of his ships still in formation. Only a handful of ships based at Cork under Rear-Admiral Robert Kingsmill, principally [...] under Captain George Lumsdaine and a frigate squadron, interfered with the French fleet: Polyphemus seized the transport [...] on 30 December and [...] captured the transport [...] shortly afterwards, although she was later recaptured by the French frigate [...]|$|E
500|$|Three weeks later, Hubbard {{abducted}} both Northrup and Alexis. On {{the night}} of February 24, 1951, Alexis was being looked after by John Sanborne while Northrup had {{a night at the}} movies. Hubbard turned up and took the child. A few hours later, he returned with two of his Dianetics Foundation staff and told Northrup, who was now back at her apartment: [...] "We have Alexis and you'll never see her alive unless you come with us." [...] She was bundled {{into the back of a}} car and driven to San Bernardino, California, where Hubbard attempted to find a doctor to examine his wife and declare her insane. His search was unsuccessful and he released her at Yuma Airport across the state line in Arizona. He promised that he would tell her where Alexis was if she signed a piece of paper saying that she <b>had</b> <b>gone</b> <b>with</b> him voluntarily. Northrup agreed but Hubbard reneged on the deal and flew to Chicago, where he found a psychologist who wrote a favorable report about his mental condition to refute Northrup's accusations. Rather than telling Northrup where Alexis was, he called her and said that [...] "he had cut [...] into little pieces and dropped the pieces in a river and that he had seen little arms and legs floating down the river and it was my fault, I'd done it because I'd left him." ...|$|E
