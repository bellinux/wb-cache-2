SPoRT {{was awarded a}} NASA Applied Science: Disasters <b>Feasibility</b> <b>award</b> to investigate the applicability of including remote sensing imagery and derived products into the NOAA/NWS (National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration/National Weather System) Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT). Proposal team was awarded the 3 -year proposal to implement a web mapping service and associate data feeds from the USGS (U. S. Geological Survey) to provide satellite imagery and derived products directly to the NWS thru the DAT. In the United States, NOAA/NWS is charged with performing damage assessments when storm or tornado damage is suspected after a severe weather event. This {{has led to the}} development of the Damage Assessment Toolkit (DAT), an application for smartphones, tablets and web browsers that allows for the collection, geo-location, and aggregation of various damage indicators collected during storm surveys...|$|E
40|$|Polymerase I and {{transcript}} {{release factor}} (PTRF) /Cavin is a cytoplasmic protein whose expression is obligatory for caveola formation. Using biochemistry and fluorescence resonance energy transfer–based approaches, we now {{show that a}} family of related proteins, PTRF/Cavin- 1, serum deprivation response (SDR) /Cavin- 2, SDR-related gene product that binds to C kinase (SRBC) /Cavin- 3, and muscle-restricted coiled-coil protein (MURC) /Cavin- 4, forms a multiprotein complex that associates with caveolae. This complex can constitutively assemble in the cytosol and associate with caveolin at plasma membrane caveolae. Cavin- 1, but not other cavins, can induce caveola formation in a heterologous system and {{is required for the}} recruitment of the cavin complex to caveolae. The tissue-restricted expression of cavins suggests that caveolae may perform tissue-specific functions regulated by the composition of the cavin complex. Cavin- 4 is expressed predominantly in muscle, and its distribution is perturbed in human muscle disease associated with Caveolin- 3 dysfunction, identifying Cavin- 4 as a novel muscle disease candidate caveolar protein.

The contract to undertake the <b>feasibility</b> study was <b>awarded</b> to a consortium led by RPS Group and its final reports were delivered to the inter-governmental steering group in late-2011.

40|$|Project delays are a {{large and}} {{prevalent}} problem in the Gilgit-Baltistan construction industry, and delays can distinctly affect project duration, budget, and also community needs. The {{purpose of this study}} is to highlight and rank delaying factors in the Annual Development Programme public sector building infrastructure projects and examine them through a relative importance index. A total of 52 delaying factors were identified through a detailed literature review and categorized into eight major groups, and a pilot study with 16 experienced construction experts was conducted. A questionnaire survey was conducted to collect the importance of each factor from public construction experts. In total, 102 respondents participated in the survey. The study determined that difficulties in financing projects by contractors, delays in progress payments, dispute on land usage, improper project <b>feasibility</b> studies, <b>award</b> project to the lowest bid price, extreme weather conditions, inadequate contractor experience, and insufficient data collection and survey before design were among the top eight critical delaying factors. In addition, Spearman’s rank correlation tests revealed that there was no difference in perception between owners and contractors. A comparison of the top five delay factors was done with eight preferred construction industries in Asia to validate the results of this study. The findings are likely to be a solid contribution to the Gilgit-Baltistan construction industry in mitigating future construction delays...|$|R

Thus, construction of an alternate route was designed to make the trip safer, as well as reducing travel time. Approved in 1987 and completed in 1999, at a cost of $458 million, the alternate route, eventually named I-49, had an obstacle of an unnamed 1800 ft peak just north of the Washington-Crawford county line in what John Haman of Arkansas Business called [...] "smack in the middle of motoring wilderness." [...] A tunnel <b>feasibility</b> study was <b>awarded</b> to Garver USA, which subcontracted with Sverdrup Corporation of Maryland Heights, Missouri, and TapanAm Associates, Inc., of Kansas City, Missouri, to determine the best option—a tunnel. The alternative would disfigure the topography and necessitate a 200 ft cut creating [...] of debris to be disposed, as it was not usable within the project.|$|R

40|$|This study {{reports on}} a facile and widely {{applicable}} method of transferring chemical vapor deposited (CVD) graphene uniformly onto optically transparent and mechanically flexible substrates using commercially available, low-cost ultraviolet adhesive (UVA) and hot-press lamination (HPL). We report on the adhesion potential between the graphene and the substrate, and we compare these findings {{with those of the}} more commonly used cast polymer handler transfer processes. Graphene transferred with the two proposed methods showed lower surface energy and displayed a higher degree of adhesion (UVA: 4. 40 ± 1. 09 N/m, HPL: 0. 60 ± 0. 26 N/m) compared to equivalent CVD-graphene transferred using conventional poly(methyl methacrylate) (PMMA: 0. 44 ± 0. 06 N/m). The mechanical robustness of the transferred graphene was investigated by measuring the differential resistance as a function of bend angle and repeated bend-relax cycles across a range of bend radii. At a bend angle of 100 ° and a 2. 5 mm bend radius, for both transfer techniques, the normalized resistance of graphene transferred on polyethylene terephthalate (PET) was around 80 times less than that of indium-tin oxide on PET. After 10 (4) bend cycles, the resistance of the transferred graphene on PET using UVA and HPL was found to be, on average, around 25. 5 and 8. 1 % higher than that of PMMA-transferred graphene, indicating that UVA- and HPL-transferred graphene are more strongly adhered compared to PMMA-transferred graphene. The robustness, in terms of maintained electrical performance upon mechanical fatigue, of the transferred graphene was around 60 times improved over ITO/PET upon many thousands of repeated bending stress cycles. On the basis of present production methods, the development of the next-generation of highly conformal, diverse form factor electronics, exploiting the emerging family of two-dimensional materials, necessitates the development of simple, low-cost, and mechanically robust transfer processes; the developed UVA and HPL approaches show significant potential and allow for large-area-compatible, near-room temperature transfer of graphene onto a diverse range of polymeric supports.
