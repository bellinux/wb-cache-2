40|$|This study investigates {{whether the}} {{necessary}} preconditions for applying a citizen-centered approach {{exist in the}} relationship between Egyptian citizens abroad and the Ministry of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Affairs</b> (represented by diplomatic missions abroad). It also explores ways of making the bureaucracy more prepared for applying this new approach in an attempt to enhance consular service provision, and to rebuild the lost trust between Egyptians abroad and the Egyptian government. The study showed that even though there are continuous interactions between citizens abroad and diplomatic missions, the communication pattern between the two sides is still in the information stage, and has not moved to the consultation or active participation stage. The decision-making cycle within the Ministry of <b>Foreign</b> <b>Affairs</b> regarding consular <b>services</b> reveals that even though ministry employees try to incorporate citizens’ demands while formulating laws or designing consular services, citizens are not directly involved in the process. The study also showed that both sides of the relationship, ministry employees and citizens, have trust issues with each other. Recommendation...|$|R
