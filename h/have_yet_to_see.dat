Peter Weiniger from The Age was prepared to give the series a chance based on the episode, saying [...] "Like most American sitcoms, The Drew Carey Show {{has its share of}} snappy one-liners but it gives the impression of trying a little too hard.

The Hall, the Drawing Room, Lord Bute's Bedroom and Lady Bute's Bedroom form a suite of rooms that exemplify the High Victorian Gothic style of 19th century Britain. Unlike {{the exterior of the}} castle, which deliberately imitated the architecture of the 13th century, the interior was purely High Victorian in style. On Burges's decoration of Cardiff Castle and Castell Coch, Handley-Read wrote: [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> any High Victorian interiors from the hand, very largely, of one designer, to equal either in homogeneity or completeness, in quality of execution or originality of conception the best of the interiors of the Welsh castles.

500|$|At London's Abbey Road Studios on 20 May 1970, Harrison {{performed}} [...] "Let It Down" [...] among {{a selection}} of songs for Spector, {{with a view to}} narrowing down the amount of material that they would be recording for All Things Must Pass.

In January 2001, Harrison included the song, along with a similar run-through of [...] "Beware of Darkness", as one of five bonus tracks on the 30th anniversary reissue of All Things Must Pass; in his liner notes, he states that he had been unaware that the session was ever recorded. Harrison added acoustic lead guitar to the song, as well as a string-synthesizer part played by Ray Cooper, both recorded at Harrison's home studio, FPSHOT, during 2000.|$|E
2500|$|Around {{the late}} 190s, the {{northern}} warlord Yuan Shao heard of Cui Yan and recruited {{the latter to}} serve under him. At the time, due to widespread chaos and famine, many soldiers had resorted to crime {{as a means of}} survival and some started robbing and plundering tombs. Cui Yan urged Yuan Shao to maintain good discipline among his troops, saying, [...] "In the past, Sun Qing once said: 'If the soldiers in an army are ill disciplined, the army's prowess will be weak. It will not achieve victory even if it was led by either Tang of Shang or King Wu of Zhou.' As of now, the roads are covered with the remains of the dead and the people <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> your virtuous deeds. You should order all commandery and county officials to ensure that the dead are properly buried, so as to showcase your sympathy and compassion by following the benevolent acts of King Wen of Zhou."

2500|$|In 205, after Cao Cao had {{defeated}} the Yuan brothers and taken over Ji Province, {{he wanted to}} recruit Cui Yan {{to serve as an}} Attendant Officer (別駕從事; an aide-de-camp) under him. He told the latter, [...] "According to official records, there are 300,000 troops under my command now. (Ji Province) is indeed a large province." [...] Cui Yan replied, [...] "The Empire {{is in a state of}} chaos and the Nine Provinces are divided, while the Yuan brothers fight among themselves and the bodies of the dead are scattered throughout the wilderness. The people <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> how your forces will bring benevolent rule and relief aid to them and liberate them from war and disaster, but now the first thing you do is to check the records for the numbers of troops and military equipment you've obtained. Is this what the people in this province expect of you?" [...] Those present at the scene were all startled by Cui Yan's response. Cao Cao's facial expression changed and he thanked Cui Yan for his advice.|$|E

In point of fact, every man is apt to think himself possessed of an exceptional gift in this direction, and that even if his humour does not express itself in the power either to make a joke or to laugh at one, it none the less consists in a peculiar insight or inner light superior to that of other people.|$|E
60|$|I must {{add that}} in my opinion, and Captain Danielson's also, R. C. is a {{superior}} angler, and all unconscious of it. He has not my intimate knowledge of big fish, {{but he did not}} seem to need that. He is powerful in the shoulders and arms, his hands are strong and hard from baseball and rowing, and he is practically tireless. He never rested while fighting a fish. We never saw him lean the rod on the gunwale. All of which accounts for his quick conquering of a Marlin swordfish. We <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> him work upon a broadbill or a big tuna; and that is something Captain Dan and I are anticipating with much pleasure and considerable doubt.|$|E
60|$|Since {{the return}} and {{the wars of}} the French, many chiefs have been deposed, and many {{so-called}} chiefs appointed. We have seen, in the same house, one such upstart drinking {{in the company of}} two such extruded island Bourbons, men, whose word a few years ago was life and death, now sunk to be peasants like their neighbours. So when the French overthrew hereditary tyrants, dubbed the commons of the Marquesas freeborn citizens of the republic, and endowed them with a vote for a conseiller-general at Tahiti, they probably conceived themselves upon the path to popularity; and so far from that, they were revolting public sentiment. The deposition of the chiefs was perhaps sometimes needful; the appointment of others may have been needful also; it was at least a delicate business. The Government of George II. exiled many Highland magnates. It never occurred to them to manufacture substitutes; and if the French have been more bold, we <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> with what success.|$|E

Foolish it is to cling to the hope of meeting her again, as that vision of loveliness--that creature of affection and simplicity, that first awoke me to a return of cheerfulness! The boy, too--my godson, my child! {{he has been the}} dream of my solitude. At last, here is the village. How bright its welcome, this summer evening! Old faces!--may those at home be as unchanged. Alteration enough here! Even at this distance I see the ruin; but how richly green the park! How fresh the trees, and the shade of the avenue! This is home, thanks to Him who has led me safely back. Whom do I see yonder in the avenue? A gentleman leading a pony, and a little boy on it! Can it be?--impossible! Yet the step and manner are just as he used to lead Violet's horse, Surely, it must be he! I must meet him and hear all before going up to the house, it will prepare them. Stop here.|$|E
6000|$|... "When I build my cathedral, that woman," [...] I said, {{pointing}} to a small painting by the fire, [...] "shall {{be among the first}} of my saints. You see her there, in an every-day dress-cap with a mortal thread-lace border, and with a very ordinary worked collar, fastened by a visible and terrestrial breastpin. There is no nimbus around her head, no sign of the cross upon her breast; her hands are clasped on no crucifix or rosary. Her clear, keen, hazel eye looks as if it could sparkle with mirthfulness, as in fact it could; there are in it both the subtile flash of wit and the subdued light of humor; and though the whole face smiles, it has yet a certain decisive firmness that speaks the soul immutable in good. That woman shall be the first saint in my cathedral, and her name shall be recorded as Saint Esther. What makes saintliness in my view, as distinguished from ordinary goodness, is a certain quality of magnanimity and greatness of soul that brings life within the circle of the heroic. To be really great in little things, to be truly noble and heroic in the insipid details of every-day life, is a virtue so rare as to be worthy of canonization,--and this virtue was hers. New England Puritanism must be credited with the making of many such women. Severe as was her discipline, and harsh as seems now her rule, we <b>have</b> <b>yet</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> whether women will be born of modern systems of tolerance and indulgence equal to those grand ones of the olden times whose places now know them no more. The inconceivable austerity and solemnity with which Puritanism invested this mortal life, the awful grandeur of the themes which it made household words, the sublimity of the issues which it hung upon the commonest acts of our earthly existence, created characters of more than Roman strength and greatness; and the good men and women of Puritan training excelled the saints of the Middle Ages, as a soul fully developed intellectually, educated to closest thought, and exercised in reasoning, is superior to a soul great merely through impulse and sentiment.|$|E
