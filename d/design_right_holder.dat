40|$|Rights {{of first}} refusal are {{contract}} clauses {{intended to provide}} the holder of a license or lease with some protection when the contract ends. The simplest version gives the <b>right</b> <b>holder</b> the ability to act after potential competitors. However, another common implementation requires the <b>right</b> <b>holder</b> to accept or reject some offers before potential competitors are given the same offer, and, if the <b>right</b> <b>holder</b> rejects the initial offer, allows {{the right to be}} exercised affirmatively only if competitors are subsequently offered a better deal (e. g. a lower price). We explore, theoretically and experimentally, the impact this latter form of right of first refusal can have on the outcome of negotiation. Counterintuitively, this "right" of first refusal can be disadvantageous to its holder. This suggests that applied contract design may benefit from the same kind of attention to detail that has begun to be given to practical market <b>design.</b> Contract <b>design</b> <b>Right</b> of First Refusal Bargaining experiments...|$|R

Final version {{published}} in Journal of Computer, Media and Telecommunications LawUS cases concerning Peer-to-Peer technologies (hereafter â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 p 2 pâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9) and Digital Rights Management (â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 8 DRMâ 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 9) mechanisms have placed considerable emphasis upon the financial interests of <b>right</b> <b>holders,</b> {{in particular the}} markets for their copyright works. The {{reason for this is}} historical â 8 ̆ 09 ̆ 3 courts have often emphasised the interests of the <b>right</b> <b>holder,</b> and furthermore, assumed the interests of the <b>right</b> <b>holder</b> are synonymous with encouraging new creative copyright works. However, in the context of p 2 p and DRM, the interests of <b>right</b> <b>holders,</b> authors, and content recipients are in pronounced conflict. For this reason, the historically market orientated approach of the courts ultimately over emphasise the interests of <b>right</b> <b>holders.</b> This paper suggests that an alternative historical approach to copyright infringement in the UK can go some way to restoring the copyright balance...|$|R

Female fishers and <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> are found to be more risk averse than their male counterparts, while <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> are found to be less risk averse relative to subjects without fishing rights. Risk attitudes are found to be correlated with compliance with fisheries regulations. In particular, a greater degree of risk aversion translates into a reduction in compliance.

40|$|In declaratory {{judgment}} actions brought by alleged infringers against <b>rights</b> <b>holders,</b> such as actions for {{declaration of invalidity}} or non-infringement of intellectual property rights, U. S. courts have long maintained that sending a cease-and-desist letter alone, absent other acts in an alleged infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum, is not a sufficient basis for personal jurisdiction over the <b>rights</b> <b>holder</b> who mailed them to the alleged infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum. Notwithstanding the similarities between cease-and-desist letters and notifications under the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA), the Tenth Circuit Court of Appeals recently decided that sending a notification alone does establish a basis for personal jurisdiction over the <b>rights</b> <b>holder.</b> Contrary to {{the decision of the}} Tenth Circuit, this article suggests that cease-and-desist letters and DMCA notifications should be treated similarly. First, as a matter of doctrine, the two instruments are similar enough to warrant application of the same rule. If a letter does not support the exercise of personal jurisdiction in {{declaratory judgment}} actions against the <b>rights</b> <b>holder,</b> neither should a notification. Second, as a matter of policy, maintaining the same approach to the two instruments would promote settlements. The Tenth Circuit 2 ̆ 7 s approach defeats this pro-settlement policy because it discourages <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> from using notifications to achieve a speedy removal of allegedly infringing material from the Internet. To avoid personal jurisdiction in the infringer 2 ̆ 7 s forum, <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> must refrain from using a notification and are thereby deprived of the option to stop further infringements immediately; without such an option {{they are less likely to}} seek settlement before filing a lawsuit. It is important to clarify whether notifications will be a basis of personal jurisdiction over a <b>rights</b> <b>holder</b> because the result will determine how practicable the use of notifications will be for <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> and therefore how effective the notification system will be...|$|R
40|$|In June 1993 the Namibian {{government}} announced the expiration of existing fishing {{rights and the}} application of a new fishing rights system starting in January 1994. Rights are now granted for seven, 10, 15 and 20 years on the basis of investment, Namibian participation and other requirements. Data are gathered by surveys on income and expenditure to fulfil the policy conditions. In this study, part of the data are used to test if there are any statistical relationships between various factors such as levels of investment, interest rates, fishing income and quota, and the length of fishing rights. A log-linear model is derived to analyse elements that influence investment. In addition, the relationship between social contribution and length of fishing rights is explored. The results indicate that the interest rate is insignificant, while quota and fishing income influence investment. In particular, short term <b>right</b> <b>holders</b> invest almost twice as much as long term <b>right</b> <b>holders.</b> The model indicated positive net (but declining gross) investment for long term <b>right</b> <b>holders.</b> Long term <b>rights</b> <b>holders</b> also contribute more in terms of social activities than short term <b>rights</b> <b>holders.</b> Incentive...|$|R
