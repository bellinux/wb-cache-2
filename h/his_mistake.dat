Having accumulated no substantial wealth during his lifetime, he subsisted on his savings, a small pension, and the income produced by his farm. Harrison cultivated corn and established a distillery to produce whiskey. After a brief time in the liquor business, he became disturbed by the effects of alcohol on its consumers, and closed the distillery. In a later address to the Hamilton County Agricultural Board in 1831, Harrison said he had sinned in making whiskey, and hoped that others would learn from <b>his</b> <b>mistake</b> and stop the production of liquors.|$|E

5|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the third}} session on Saturday {{with a time of}} 1m41.856s.

He again failed in his attempt on a very fast lap on the super-soft tyres later in the session, being forced wide after repeating <b>his</b> <b>mistake</b> at turn five. Hamilton was just marginally ahead of Sebastian Vettel, who finished third ahead of Pérez. Daniil Kvyat was unable to set a timed lap as his team worked to solve an electrical problem.|$|E

5|$|When the Bahraini {{uprising}} {{started in}} February 2011, Al-Wasat and al-Jamri covered {{both sides of}} the conflict.

Marsh himself was not infallible; he put the wrong skull on a skeleton of Apatosaurus and declared it a new genus, Brontosaurus.|$|E

5|$|Finding American {{distributors}} {{proved more}} troublesome. Memento was screened for various studio heads (including Miramax chief Harvey Weinstein) in March 2000. Although {{most of the}} executives loved the film and praised Nolan's talent, all passed on distributing the picture, believing it was too confusing and would not attract a large audience. After famed independent film director Steven Soderbergh saw the film and learned it was not being distributed, he championed the film in interviews and public events, giving it even more publicity, {{although he did not}} secure a distributor. Newmarket, in a financially risky move, decided to distribute the film itself. After the first few weeks of distribution, Memento had reached more than 500 theaters and earned a domestic total of $25million in its box-office run. The film's success was surprising to those who passed on the film, so much so that Weinstein realized <b>his</b> <b>mistake</b> and tried to buy the film from Newmarket.|$|E
5|$|Gerard DuGalle is the {{commanding}} admiral of the United Earth Directorate's expeditionary {{force to the}} Koprulu Sector. DuGalle only appears in Brood War and is voiced by Jack Ritschel. Considered the UED's most capable military leader, DuGalle, a Frenchman, is a staunch believer in the UED's mission to pacify the sector and carries out his orders with precision. In Brood War, DuGalle leads the UED as it conquers the Terran Dominion; however, despite his experience, DuGalle believes misinformation planted by former Confederate soldier Samir Duran regarding a psi disruptor, a device that disrupts Zerg communications, on Tarsonis. When DuGalle's lifelong friend Alexei Stukov abandons the fleet, DuGalle allows Duran to assassinate Stukov as a traitor, only realizing <b>his</b> <b>mistake</b> too late. Nevertheless, DuGalle acts to prevent Duran destroying the psi disruptor and uses it to capture the Zerg Overmind on Char. However, {{as a result of}} demoralization, limited manpower and an alliance of enemies led by Kerrigan, the fleet is eventually pushed back and when a final attempt to recapture Char fails, DuGalle orders the retreat. Shortly before the UED fleet is overtaken by Zerg and destroyed, DuGalle composes a letter to his wife in which he admits responsibility for his closest friend's death and commits suicide by a gunshot to the head.|$|E
