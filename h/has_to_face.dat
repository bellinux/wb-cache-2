5|$|While Agni is the saviour in the Kurma Purana, the Rama-centric Adhyatma Ramayana replaces Agni {{with the}} omniscient Rama as the mastermind. Rama knows of Ravana's {{intentions}} and orders Sita to place her chaya (shadow) outside the hut for Ravana to abduct and {{go inside the}} hut and live hidden in the fire for a year; after Ravana's death, she would unite with him again. Sita complies and creates her illusionary form, Maya Sita, and enters the fire. After Maya Sita's seizure, Rama grieves for Sita. It is unclear if Rama pretends to grieve or forgets that Maya Sita is the one actually kidnapped. After Ravana's death, Maya Sita <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the Agni Pariksha and vanishes in the fire. Agni reinstates Sita and declares that Rama created the illusionary Sita to bring about Ravana's annihilation and with that purpose served, the true Sita returns to Rama. Inspired by Adhyatma Ramayana, the Ramacharitmanas has a very similar narrative; however, Agni Pariskha narrative is longer and Maya Sita is explicitly stated to be destroyed in the fire. The Nepali Bhanubhakta Ramayana by Bhanubhakta Acharya (1814 – 1868) portrays Rama creating the illusionary Sita from the sacred Kusha grass and entrusting Sita to Agni; at Agni Pariksha, the grass Maya Sita turns into ashes while the true Sita reappears before the world. A popular Indian television series Ramayan (1987–88) by Ramanand Sagar reveals that Maya Sita had replaced Sita only in the Agni Pariksha scene and uses flashback to narrate about the exchange.|$|E

The tourism industry in Indonesia has also faced setbacks due to problems related to security. Since 2002, warnings have been issued by some countries over terrorist threats and ethnic as well as religious conflicts in some areas, significantly reducing the number of foreign visitors for a few years. However, the number of international tourists has bounced back positively since 2007, and reached a new record in 2008 and kept rising since then.|$|E

500|$|The novel {{exposes the}} loss of innocence so {{frequently}} that reviewer R. A. Dave claims that because every character <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>face,</b> or even suffer defeat, the book takes on elements of a classical tragedy. In exploring how each character deals {{with his or her}} own personal defeat, Lee builds a framework to judge whether the characters are heroes or fools. She guides the reader in such judgments, alternating between unabashed adoration and biting irony. Scout's experience with the Missionary Society is an ironic juxtaposition of women who mock her, gossip, and [...] "reflect a smug, colonialist attitude toward other races" [...] while giving the [...] "appearance of gentility, piety, and morality". Conversely, when Atticus loses Tom's case, he is last to leave the courtroom, except for his children and the black spectators in the colored balcony, who rise silently as he walks underneath them, to honor his efforts.|$|E

Producer David Heyman supported Yates' comments about the film's political theme, stating that [...] " [...] is a political film, not with a capital P, but it's about teen rebellion and the abuse of power. David has made films in the UK about politics without being heavy handed." [...] On the film's political and social aspects, Emma Watson stated that [...] "somehow it talks about life after 7 July, the way people behave when they’re scared, the way truth is often denied {{and all the things}} our society <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>face.</b> Facing the fact that the authority is corrupted means having a non-conformist approach to reality and power." ...|$|E

[...] Pryce had a role in [...] (2003), in which he portrayed a fictional Governor of Jamaica, Weatherby Swann, a film he has described as [...] "one of those why-not movies." [...] After Pirates, Pryce appeared in several large-scale motion pictures, such as De-Lovely (2004), his second musical film, a chronicle of the life of songwriter Cole Porter, for which Kevin Kline and Pryce covered a Porter song called [...] "Blow, Gabriel, Blow". The Brothers Grimm (2005), Pryce's third completed film with Terry Gilliam, starred Matt Damon and Heath Ledger, and The New World (2005), in which he had a cameo role as King James I. In 2005, Pryce was nominated for another Olivier Award in the best actor category {{for his role in the}} 2004 London production of The Goat or Who is Sylvia?, where he played Martin, a goat-lover who <b>has</b> <b>to</b> <b>face</b> the recriminations of his cheated-on wife, played by his real-life wife Kate Fahy.

All the actors who are billed as series regulars portray physicians from the surgical wing of the fictional Seattle Grace Hospital.
