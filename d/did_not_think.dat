5|$|Though Wilhelm was {{primarily}} a starting pitcher in the minor leagues, he had been called up to a Giants team whose strong starting pitchers had led them to a National League (NL) pennant the year before. Giants manager Leo Durocher <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that Wilhelm's knuckleball approach would be effective {{for more than a}} few innings at a time. He assigned Wilhelm to the team's bullpen.|$|E
5|$|According to Moberly and Jourdain, the {{two women}} decided to visit the Palace of Versailles as part of several trips. On 10 August 1901, they {{travelled}} by train to Versailles. They <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> much of the palace after touring it, {{so they decided to}} walk through the gardens to the Petit Trianon. On the way, they reached the Grand Trianon and found it was closed to the public.|$|E

5|$|After resigning, Rudd {{stated that}} he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> Gillard could defeat the Coalition at the next {{election}} and that, since his resignation, he had received encouragement from Labor MPs and Cabinet Ministers to contest the leadership. Gillard responded to these developments by announcing a leadership ballot for the morning of 27 February 2012, saying that if she lost the vote she {{would return to the}} backbench and renounce any claims to the leadership. She asked that Rudd make the same commitment.|$|E
5|$|After {{writing down}} rules {{about how the}} music was to be used, such as {{specific}} scenes certain songs should be used in, or ways a certain song should not be used, the game's scripters implemented the music at points they found fitting. During debugging, Nakazawa would request fixes for songs that he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> fit the scenes they were used in. For the PlayStation Portable release, Asami Imai performed the opening theme.|$|E

Taesabunim (Supreme Dao Master) teaches that when meditating, [...] "Do <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of goodness. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of badness." [...] This is the nondiscriminating mind that allows a practitioner to become one with the universe. <b>Do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of yourself as good or bad, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of others as good or bad, <b>do</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> of any phenomena as good or bad.

5|$|In 1951, in a {{paper in}} Astrophysics: A Topical Symposium, Gerard Kuiper speculated on a similar disc having formed early in the Solar System's evolution, but he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that such a belt still existed today. Kuiper was {{operating}} on the assumption, common in his time, that Pluto {{was the size of}} Earth and had therefore scattered these bodies out toward the Oort cloud or out of the Solar System. Were Kuiper's hypothesis correct, there would not be a Kuiper belt today.|$|E
5|$|Lobengula {{refused to}} allow any of the izinDuna to sign the document. Exactly why he did this is not clear. Rudd's {{interpretation}} was that the king considered them to have already been consulted at the day's indaba, and so <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> it necessary for them to also sign. Keppel-Jones comments that Lobengula might have felt {{that it would be}} harder to repudiate the document later if it bore the marks of his izinDuna alongside his own.|$|E

5|$|Several game {{websites}} {{were outraged}} at Nintendo's decision. Though disappointed with Nintendo's decision, McMillen <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> {{the loss of}} the 3DS port was a major issue, and saw a brief sales burst on Steam as the news was covered in gaming website. McMillen further praised the flexibility of the Steam platform, which does not require games to obtain ESRB ratings to be published on the service, and the freedom it gave to the publishers regardless of the game content.|$|E
5|$|The {{film was}} {{initially}} screened for the producers in October 1926, but they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> {{much of the}} film and decided to shelve it. However, due to the runaway success of , which was released in February 1927, the producers decided to release The Mountain Eagle three months later on 23 May 1927. The film was reportedly released in the United States as Fear o' God, but the title on the surviving US lobby card seems to contradict this. Film historian J. Larry Kuhns claims that the film was never released under that title.|$|E

5|$|After {{she turned}} 15, Falle {{had her first}} {{experience}} in the sex industry {{at a party in}} a bar in Chinatown, Calgary. A 25-year-old man at the party who had forged identity documents convinced her to sell sex for money and give him half of her earnings. Falle found this man well-dressed and attractive and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> that he fit the stereotypical image of a pimp. She had nowhere to sleep that night and had no money for food, so she accepted his offer. The man to whom she sold sex that night had teeth that were rotten. They had sex on a soiled mattress in a poorly-ventilated restaurant attic, and she received $100.|$|E
5|$|Although Monroe {{had become}} one of 20th Century-Fox's biggest stars, her {{contract}} had not changed since 1950, meaning that she was paid far less than other stars of her stature and could not choose her projects or co-workers. She was also tired of being typecast, and her attempts to appear in films other than comedies or musicals had been thwarted by Zanuck, who had a strong personal dislike of her and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> she would earn the studio as much revenue in dramas. When she refused to begin shooting yet another musical comedy, a film version of The Girl in Pink Tights, which was to co-star Frank Sinatra, the studio suspended her on January 4, 1954.|$|E

5|$|As {{a medieval}} Christian author William could hardly avoid hostility towards the kingdom's Muslim neighbours, {{but as an}} educated man who lived among Muslims in the east, he was rarely polemical or {{completely}} dismissive of Islam. He <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> Muslims were pagans, but rather that they belonged to a heretical sect of Christianity and followed the teachings of a false prophet. He often praised the Muslim leaders of his own day, even if he lamented their power over the Christian kingdom; thus Muslim rulers such as Mu'in ad-Din Unur, Nur ad-Din, Shirkuh, and even Jerusalem's ultimate conqueror Saladin are presented as honourable and pious men, characteristics that William did not bestow on many of his own Christian contemporaries.|$|E
5|$|As {{the rift}} between {{the players and}} Brown and between Modell and Brown grew, Modell fired Brown on January 7, 1963. A {{controversy}} developed over {{the timing of the}} decision amid a local newspaper strike, which limited discussion of the move. A printing company executive, however, got together a group of sportswriters and published a 32-page magazine fielding players' views on the firing. Opinions were mixed; Modell came in for his share of criticism, but tackle and team captain Mike McCormack said he <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> the team could win under Brown. Blanton Collier, Brown's longtime assistant, was named the team's new head coach, and Brown began to plan his next move as he continued to receive an $82,500 salary under his eight-year contract.|$|E

Between 1991 and 2000, the pair competed in multiple {{national and international}} championships, including three Olympic Games and two World Equestrian Games. They won one gold medal and four silver medals at the Olympics and one gold and three silvers at the World Equestrian Games. Although known for having a hot temperament, Bonfire mellowed as he aged, becoming one of Van Grunsven's best horses – until she found his replacement, Salinero, she <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>think</b> she would ever find a horse to match Bonfire's talent. A statue of Bonfire stands in Van Grunsven's home town of Erp.|$|E
