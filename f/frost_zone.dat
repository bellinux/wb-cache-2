40|$|We {{have used}} {{reflection}} profiles and common-midpoint (CMP) soundings with 900 MHz ground-penetrating radar (GPR) to monitor freezing and thawing processes during winter seasonal periods at two separate sites located in Ontario, Canada. GPR {{responds to the}} large contrast in dielectric permittivity between liquid water and ice. The profiles reveal the long-term development of a very shallow (< 0. 5 m) soil <b>frost</b> <b>zone</b> overlying unfrozen wet substratum. During {{the course of the}} winter season, long-term travel time analysis yielded physical properties of the frozen and unfrozen layers as well as the spatial distribution of the base of the soil <b>frost</b> <b>zone.</b> Short-term shallow thawing events overlying frozen substratum formed a dispersive waveguide for both the CMP and reflection profile surveys. Inversion of the dispersive wavefields for the CMP data yielded physical property estimates for the thawed and frozen soils and thawed layer thickness. We have shown that GPR can be used to monitor very shallow freezing and thawing events by responding to changes in the relative dielectric permittivity of the soil water phase (e. g. liquid water vs ice). The non-invasive collection of such data permits interpretation of dynamic temporal and spatial freeze-thaw events, which are important for characterizing a range of hydrological processes.

40|$|The {{development}} of a new frosting map for air-source heat pumps (ASHPs) based on a temperature-humidity chart is reported in this paper. Through a parametric analysis, two boundary lines (a condensing line and a frosting line) were obtained, dividing the map into three regions: a non-frosting region, a condensing region and a frosting region. Using the simulation results from a generalized numerical model of frost growth, the frosting region was further divided into three indicative <b>zones</b> representing different <b>frosting</b> levels: a severe <b>frosting</b> <b>zone,</b> a moderate <b>frosting</b> <b>zone</b> (I, II) and a mild <b>frosting</b> <b>zone</b> (I, II). Lab and field tests were conducted in order to verify the correctness of the zoning and to obtain indicative defrosting intervals for ASHPs operated at different zones.

40|$|Frost is {{a decisive}} factor {{influencing}} pavement performance in cold countries. In the EU, millions of euros are spent annually on winter maintenance. About {{one-third of the}} maintenance budget is allocated to rehabilitation due to {{the negative impact of}} frost. The negative effect of frost is restricted by using non-frost-susceptible materials within the <b>frost</b> <b>zone</b> and regulating water accumulation.

When LDW are used, the usage factor (ratio of repository surface area, protected with natural barrier, to total repository surface area) of the geological barrier (hosting rocks) is about 1, as almost all of the surface of the repository is protected with hosting rocks. This helps draw the conclusion that, even {{in the case of the}} total destruction of all engineered barriers, which is very unlikely, radionuclides will still be constrained in a small volume of the hosting rocks and their release to the human activity sphere is virtually impossible.

40|$|Near-surface sediments in the vadose zone play a {{fundamental}} {{role in the}} hydrologic system. The shallow vadose zone can act as a buffer to delay or attenuate surface contaminants before they reach the water table. It also acts as a temporary soil moisture reservoir for plant and atmospheric uptake, and regulates the seasonal groundwater recharge process. Over the past few decades, geophysical methods have received unprecedented attention as an effective vadose zone characterization tool offering a range of non-invasive to minimally invasive techniques with the capacity to provide detailed soil moisture information at depths typically unattainable using conventional point-measurement sensors. Ground-penetrating radar (GPR) has received much of this attention due to its high sensitivity to the liquid water phase in geologic media. While much has been learned about GPR soil moisture monitoring and characterization techniques, it has not been evaluated across highly dynamic natural soil conditions. Consequently, GPR’s capacity to characterize a complete range of naturally occurring vadose zone conditions including wetting/drying and freeze/thaw cycles, is not yet fully understood. Further, the nature of GPR response during highly dynamic moisture periods has not been thoroughly investigated. The objective of this thesis is to examine the capacity of various surface GPR techniques and methodologies for the characterization of soil moisture dynamics in the upper few meters of vadose zone, and to develop measurement strategies capable of providing quantitative information about the current and future state of the shallow hydrologic system. To achieve this, an exhaustive soil moisture monitoring campaign employing a range of GPR antenna frequencies and survey acquisition geometries was initiated at three different agricultural field sites located in southern Ontario, Canada, between May 2006 and October 2008. This thesis represents the first attempt to evaluate multiple annual cycles of soil conditions and associated hydrological processes using high-frequency GPR measurements. Summaries of the seven major works embodied in this thesis are provided below. Direct ground wave (DGW) measurements obtained with GPR have been used in a number of previous studies to monitor volumetric water content changes in the root zone; however, these studies have involved controlled field experiments or measurements collected across limited ranges in soil moisture. To further investigate the capacity of the DGW method, multi-frequency (i. e., 225 MHz, 450 MHz and 900 MHz) common-midpoint (CMP) measurements were used to monitor a complete annual cycle of soil water content variations at three sites with different soil textures (i. e., sand, sandy loam and silt loam). CMP surveys permitted characterization of the nature and evolution of the near-surface electromagnetic wavefields, and their subsequent impact on DGW velocity measurements. GPR results showed significant temporal variations in both the near-surface wavefield and multi-frequency DGW velocities corresponding to both seasonal and shorter term variations in soil conditions. While all of the measurement sites displayed similar temporal responses, the rate and magnitude of these velocity variations corresponded to varying soil water contents which were primarily controlled by the soil textural properties. Overall, the DGW measurements obtained using higher frequency antennas were less impacted by near-surface wavefield interference due to their shorter signal pulse duration. The estimation of soil water content using GPR velocity requires an appropriate petrophysical relationship between the dielectric permittivity and volumetric water content of the soil. The ability of various empirical relationships, volumetric mixing formulae and effective medium approximations were evaluated to predict near-surface volumetric soil water content using high-frequency DGW velocity measurements obtained from CMP soundings. Measurements were collected using 225, 450 and 900 MHz antennas across sand, sandy loam and silt loam soil textures over a complete annual cycle of soil conditions. A lack of frequency dependence in the results indicated that frequency dispersion had minimal impact on the data set. However, the accuracy of soil water content predictions obtained from the various relationships ranged considerably. The best fitting relationships did exhibit some degree of textural bias that should be considered in the choice of petrophysical relationship for a given data set. Further improvements in water content estimates were obtained using a field calibrated third-order polynomial relationship and three-phase volumetric mixing formula. While DGW measurements provide valuable information within the root zone, the characterization of vertical moisture distribution and dynamics requires a different approach. A common approach utilizes normal-moveout (NMO) velocity analysis of CMP sounding data. To further examine this approach, an extensive field study using multi-frequency (i. e., 225 MHz, 450 MHz, 900 MHz) CMP soundings was conducted to monitor a complete annual cycle of vertical soil moisture conditions at the sand, sandy loam and silt loam sites. The use of NMO velocity analysis was examined for monitoring highly dynamic vertical soil moisture conditions consisting of wetting/drying and freeze/thaw cycles with varying degrees of magnitude and vertical velocity gradient. NMO velocity analysis was used to construct interval-velocity-depth models at a fixed location collected every 1 to 4 weeks. Time-lapse models were combined to construct temporal interval-velocity fields, which were converted into soil moisture content. These moisture fields were used to characterize the vertical distribution, and dynamics of soil moisture in the upper few meters of vadose zone. Although the use of multiple antenna frequencies provided varying investigation depths and vertical resolving capabilities, optimal characterization of soil moisture conditions was obtained with 900 MHz antennas. The integration of DGW and NMO velocity data from a single CMP sounding could be used to assess the nature of shallow soil moisture coupling with underlying vadose zone conditions; however, a more quantitative analyses of the surface moisture dynamics would require definitive knowledge of GPR sampling depth. Although surface techniques have been used by a number of previous researchers to characterize soil moisture content in the vadose zone, limited temporal sampling and low resolution near the surface in these studies impeded the quantitative analysis of vertical soil moisture distribution and its associated dynamics within the shallow subsurface. To further examine the capacity of surface GPR, an extensive 26 month field study was undertaken using concurrent high-frequency (i. e., 900 MHz) reflection profiling and CMP soundings to quantitatively monitor soil moisture distribution and dynamics within a sandy vadose zone environment. An analysis on the concurrent use of reflection and CMP measurements was conducted over two contrasting annual cycles of soil conditions. Reflection profiles provided high resolution traveltime data between four stratigraphic reflection events while cumulative results of the CMP sounding data set produced precise depth estimates for those reflecting interfaces, which were used to convert interval traveltime data into soil water content estimates. The downward propagation of episodic infiltration events associated with seasonal and transient conditions were well resolved by the GPR data. The GPR data also revealed variations in the nature of these infiltration events between contrasting annual cycles. The use of CMP soundings also permitted the determination of DGW velocities, which enabled better characterization of short-duration wetting/drying and freezing/thawing processes. This higher resolution information can be used to examine the nature of the coupling between shallow and deep moisture conditions. High-resolution surface GPR measurements were used to examine vertical soil moisture distribution and its associated dynamics within the shallow subsurface over a 26 month period. While the apparent ability of surface GPR methods to give high quality estimates of soil moisture distribution in the upper 3 meters of the vadose zone was demonstrated, the nature of these GPR-derived moisture data needed to be assessed in the context of other hydrological information. As a result, GPR soil moisture estimates were compared with predictions obtained from a well-accepted hydrological modeling package, HYDRUS- 1 D (Simunek et al., 2008). The nature of transient infiltration pulses, evapotranspiration episodes, and deep drainage patterns were examined by comparing them with vertical soil moisture flow simulations. Using laboratory derived soil hydraulic property information from soil samples and a number of simplifying assumptions about the system, very good agreement was achieved between measured and simulated soil moisture conditions without model calibration. The overall good agreement observed between forward simulations and field measurements over the vertical profile validated the capacity of surface GPR to provide detailed information about hydraulic state conditions in the upper few meters of vadose zone. A unique DGW propagation phenomenon was observed during early soil frost formation. High-frequency DGW measurements were used to monitor the seasonal development of a thin, high velocity frozen soil layer over a wet low velocity unfrozen substratum. During the freezing process, the progressive attenuation of a low velocity DGW and the subsequent development of a high velocity DGW were observed. Numerical simulations using GPRMAX 2 D (Giannopoulos, 2005) showed that low velocity DGW occurring after freezing commenced was due to energy leaking across the frozen layer from the spherical body wave in the unfrozen half space. This leaky phase progressively dissipated until the frozen layer reached a thickness equivalent to one quarter of the dominant wavelength in the frozen ground. The appearance of the high velocity DGW was governed by its destructive interference with the reflection events {{from the base of the}} frozen layer. This interference obscured the high velocity DGW until the frozen layer thickness reached one half of the dominant wavelength in the frozen ground. While GPR has been extensively used to study frozen soil conditions in alpine environments, its capacity to characterize highly dynamic shallow freeze-thaw processes typically observed in temperate environments is not well understood. High-frequency reflection profiles and CMP soundings were used to monitor the freezing and thawing process during the winter seasonal period at the sand and silt loam sites. Reflection profiles revealed the long-term development of a very shallow (< 0. 5 m) soil <b>frost</b> <b>zone</b> overlying unfrozen wet substratum. During the course of the winter season, long-term traveltime analysis yielded physical properties of the frozen and unfrozen layers as well as the spatial distribution of the base of the soil <b>frost</b> <b>zone.</b> Short-term shallow thawing events overlying frozen substratum formed a dispersive waveguide for both the CMP and reflection profile surveys. Inversion of the dispersive wavefields for the CMP data yielded physical property estimates for the thawed and frozen soils and thawed layer thickness. It was shown that GPR can be used to monitor very shallow freezing and thawing events by responding to changes in the relative dielectric permittivity of the soil water phase. The works embodied in this thesis demonstrate the effectiveness of high-frequency GPR as a non-invasive soil moisture monitoring tool under a full range of naturally occurring moisture conditions with the temporal and vertical resolution necessary to quantitatively examine shallow vadose zone moisture dynamics. Because this study encompassed an unprecedented range of naturally occurring soil conditions, including numerous short and long duration wetting/drying and freezing/thawing cycles, complex geophysical responses were observed during highly dynamic soil moisture processes. Analysis and interpretation of these geophysical responses yielded both qualitative and quantitative information about the state of the hydrologic system, and hence, provided a non-invasive means of characterizing soil moisture processes in shallow vadose zone environments. In the future, these GPR soil moisture monitoring strategies should be incorporated into advanced land-surface hydrological modeling studies to improve our understanding of shallow hydrologic systems and its impacts on groundwater resources...|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{interaction}} between frozen soil and a pipeline embedded in a discontinuous <b>frost</b> heat <b>zone.</b> The computational modelling procedures proposed in the thesis include the modelling of frost heave generation, the constitutive modelling of the frozen soil, the structural behaviour of the pipeline and the constitutive modelling of the soil-pipeline interface. The interactive thermo-hydro-mechanical processes encountered in the problem are generally time-dependent and non-linear. The frost heave modelling utilizes the three-dimensional form of a modified hydrodynamic frost heave model. A finite element implementation of the model is used to estimate the frost heave in a one-dimensional element. The comparison of the numerical results with an experimental result indicates that the prediction by computational modelling can reasonably simulate observations of one-dimensional experiments. Two-dimensional and three-dimensional simulations also indicate that the numerical modelling can predict trends of frost heave development which {{are consistent with the}} localized cooling {{at the base of a}} cuboidal element. In the development of the interaction effects, the mechanical behaviour of the frozen soil is represented by a complete creep model. The proposed complete creep model can take into consideration all three creep processes associated with frozen soils. Computations have also been conducted to calibrate the predictions of the creep model with observed experimental data. Extensive computations have been performed to investigate the general creep responses of a variety of geotechnical structures. To examine frozen soil-pipeline interaction problems, the pipeline is modelled either as a Bernoulli-Euler beam or as a cylindrical shell which accommodates both flexural and shear stiffness effects. The numerical procedures are applied to examine the pipeline freezing experiment conducted at the large scale facility in Caen, France. The temperature profiles, soil heave, pipeline deformation and flexural moments developed in the pipeline due to the generation of frost heave in the discontinuous frost heave region are documented...|$|R

Freezing temperatures are possible throughout the whole growing period in the alpine life <b>zone.</b> <b>Frost</b> severity, comprised of both intensity and duration, becomes greater with increasing elevation and, there is also a greater probability, that small statured woody plants, may be insulated by snow cover.

In these <b>zones,</b> <b>frost</b> and cold temperatures are major factors that prevent maize from reaching its full yield potential. Among 30 elite maize inbred lines adapted to northern China, we identified two lines of extreme, but opposite, freezing tolerance levels—highly tolerant and highly sensitive. During the seedling stage of these two lines, we used RNA-seq to measure changes in maize whole genome transcriptome before and after freezing treatment. In total, 19, 794 genes were expressed, of which 4, 550 exhibited differential expression due to either treatment (before or after freezing) or line type (tolerant or sensitive). Of the 4, 550 differently expressed genes, 948 exhibited differential expression due to treatment within line or lines under freezing condition. Analysis of gene ontology found that these 948 genes were significantly enriched for binding functions (DNA binding, ATP binding, and metal ion binding), protein kinase activity, and peptidase activity. Based on their enrichment, literature support, and significant levels of differential expression, 30 of these 948 genes were selected for quantitative real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) validation. The validation confirmed our RNA-Seq-based findings, with squared correlation coefficients of 80 % and 50 % in the tolerance and sensitive lines, respectively.

40|$|Graduation date: 1978 A {{survey of}} partial cuts planted with bare-root seedlings, was {{conducted}} on the Prospect Ranger District, Rogue River National Forest, Oregon, during the 1977 summer season. The purpose was to assess stocking and its composition under present levels of canopy cover, and to determine relationships between canopy density and performance of planted seedlings. Thirteen plots were established in mixed conifer partial cuts, and five were located in true fir partial cuts. Four-milacre (. 00162 ha) subplots were systematically located along equally spaced grid lines to sample stocking and several environmental factors. Larger subplots, i/s acre (. 08094 ha) in area, were superimposed over 12 four-milacre subplots in each plot to measure overstory canopy and seedling height growth. Total stocking averaged 77 and 88 percent, respectively, for the Mixed Conifer and True Fir Zones. Increases in total stocking were associated with increases in elevation, Douglas-fir (Pseudotsuga menziesii (Mirb.) Franco.) was the main stocking component on site prepared areas in the Mixed Conifer Zone; Shasta red fir (Abies magnifica Murr. var. shastensis Lemm.) was the predominant species in the True Fir Zone. Mean canopy densities varied little among partial cuts, but large local variations in canopy density occurred within plots. Small openings are just as likely to be stocked with planted seedlings as surrounding areas under canopy. Two-year height growth was very slow in both forest zones, and was not generally correlated with canopy density. However, three-year height growth of Douglas-fir was negatively correlated with canopy density in the Mixed Conifer <b>Zone.</b> <b>Frost</b> damage was observed on Douglas-fir in several clearcuts, but in only one partial cut.

40|$|This study {{concludes that}} the {{municipal}} road network in Nedre Eiker has a large maintenance backlog. There are many critical damages on the roads that should be repaired immediately. This study looked at the prevalence of damages in relation to ground conditions. Municipal roads in Nedre Eiker were used as a case in this work, and the study {{concludes that the}}re are four prominent types of injuries that occur in 4 different soil conditions. The 4 damage types are cracks, crazing, desiccation and patching. The 4 different zones with soil conditions are zone 41 (Ocean and fjord deposition, continuous cover, often with large thickness), 50 (River and stream deposition), 72 (Weathering Material, incoherent or thin cover over the bedrock) and 120 (Filling material (anthropogenic material)) from the maps from Norges Geologiske Undersøkelse. Through literature search, data collection and analysis, and evaluating results against the literature, this study shows that the proven damage {{is related to the}} ground where the road is built. Using the available literature, the study proposes what measures will be most sustainable, efficient and economical for the roads. The measures are as follows: Soil zone 41 : The <b>zone</b> contains <b>frost</b> hazardous materials, and the best action would be to build up the road again with a new substructure. The costs can be kept down if some work can be performed in combination with water and sewer upgrade. An effective drainage can extend the life of the asphalt surface, but will not eliminate problems with <b>frost.</b> Soil <b>zone</b> 50 : The zone contains a lot of sand and gravel, which suggests that a good drainage will be able to extend the road life. In addition, it will be effective to lower the groundwater level whenever possible. Soil zone 72 : The zone contains a thin incoherent layer weathering material. An efficient drainage system could extend its lifetime. Construction of a new thick substructure will probably have a poor benefit / cost. Alternatively, it could pay off with a thin supporting layer under the asphalt surface if the road will be dug up for other reasons. Soil zone 120 : This is a zone which may contain many different soil qualities. This area must be carried out geological surveys to determine the best actions. But drainage is an action that always will provide an improvement, so this will give (small) gains if there is no economy to greater improvements and sampling. This report concludes finally that there are effective solutions to road maintenance even though the road is built on a poor foundation. An extended study can find good solutions for several types of soils and ground conditions than is presented in this report. The Norwegian road network represents great values that require continuous monitoring and maintenance to maintain the desired quality. Since municipalities as road owner often have limited resources, it is important to prioritize measures where these provide the greatest economic benefit. Many of the municipal roads in Norway is in poor condition, probably both because of the bad economy and lack of expertise at the time these roads were established.

Immediately outside the shrinking cap craters appear no more modified than those in areas farther north that are not annually frost covered. Craters showing through the frost mantle are locally as abundant as elsewhere on Mars. Only in a central region close to the pole are craters sparse. Both far- and near-encounter views reveal a highly irregular pole-cap edge. Photos of the same sector taken six days apart are near duplicates, suggesting that the irregularity is primarily ground controlled. No evidence of the classical polar collar is seen. Within the marginal <b>zone,</b> <b>frost</b> is preserved largely in crater bottoms and on slopes inclined away from the sun. Preferential retention in low spots supports the earlier suggestion that the Mountains of Mitchel may actually be depressions. An argument based on insolation as the prime factor in frost wastage and the narrow width of the marginal zone suggests that slopes of topographic features therein are mostly gentle, {{on the order of}} a few degrees. The frost cover of the pole-cap interior may range widely in thickness, obscuring parts of some craters and seemingly enhancing topographic visibility elsewhere, possibly through variations in thickness and reflectivity. Unusually bright areas on the cap surface, and differences in luminance between bright rims and the more somber floors of craters and other depressions, may be {{due in large part to}} differences in related frost textures and to the local history of evaporation and sublimation. Irregularly angular depressions within the polecap frost termed ‘etch pits’ may be the product of differential ablation or the undermining by wind of a slabby surficial crust. Encircling the south pole is a region of subdued relief with a paucity of craters, which displays enigmatic quasi-linear markings believed to be ground features. Although no satisfactory explanation of these markings has been formulated, it seems likely that this region has been occupied repeatedly by perennial masses of CO_ 2 ice, formed and maintained during those phases of the martian precessional cycle that resulted in short cool summers in the southern hemisphere. Such ice masses may play a role in producing the unusual features of the central polar region. Physical relationships suggest a local maximum frost thickness as great as tens of meters. The possibility should be kept in mind that remnants of perennial CO_ 2 ice of still greater thickness may exist locally, for example, in the ‘etch pit’ area...|$|R
40|$|Requirements {{regarding}} efficient {{energy use}} and reduction in CO 2 emissions {{are becoming increasingly}} strict. The building sector accounts for {{a large part of}} CO 2 emissions and the potential for reductions within this sector should be considerable. This thesis is a continuation of the author's project thesis. The main focus is to improve the earlier model emphasizing the modeling of the interactions between the leisure home building and the ground. The goal is to develop a prototype of a leisure home where sanitary installations are kept frost proof throughout the year without the use of primary energy sources or electricity, minimizing net CO 2 emissions. The building envelope is constructed of poorly insulated log walls. The sanitary installations are placed in a thermally insulated internal zone, and an active solar heating system is developed to transfer heat into the ground in this internal zone. The intention is to store the heat, transferred to the internal zone during sunny periods, in a thermal mass under the cabin. This would then passively arise during cold periods, maintaining frost proof conditions. The leisure home is planned to be located in the southern mountain regions of Norway. Different simulation tools were considered for modeling the leisure home and its energy system. The dynamic simulation tool ESP-r was chosen, and an improved model from the project thesis was developed. Different methods and theories concerning how the solar heating system and the ground could be modeled have been studied. The interactions between the building and the ground were modeled by implementing a new basement zone for the leisure home, and defining a BASESIMP configuration as boundary conditions for the surfaces adjacent to the ground. BASESIMP performs quasi 3 -dimensional calculations for the heat transfer between the building and the ground. Since the heat storage is not taken into account in the BASESIMP configuration, the storage is represented in the ground construction; the basement floor of the inner zone. The solar heating system is represented in a control loop. The control loop injects electric heat into the basement floor for a given period each day. The electric data is based on solar radiation data, and the time intervals for when heat is injected into the floor are determined from when solar radiation is available in the day. Climate data from &# 214;stersund, Sweden has been used as an approximation as there was no available climate file for the southern mountain regions of Norway. Different system parameters have been changed to investigate the influence they have on the temperature conditions in the internal zones throughout the year. The internal zones maintain much more stable temperatures throughout the year than the outer zones. This shows that isolating the <b>frost</b> proof <b>zones</b> in the leisure home, represent a major advantage in the design process. The ground construction in the basement floor of the inner zone has been modeled as a thermal mass with high density and high specific heat capacity. This dense thermal mass is modeled to account for the whole area under the cabin. A south facing solar collector with an area of 4 m 2 and an inclination of 70 &# 176; indicates that the temperature in the internal zones stays above 4. 2 &# 176;C throughout the year, subject to the given ground conditions and without collecting heat during May until August. The delivered energy to the ground construction in the basement floor of the inner zone for a year under the given conditions and with a collector efficiency of 45 % turned out to be 878 kWh. Heat transfer from the ground into the internal zone turned out to have a significant heat contribution in cold periods. Results also showed a noticeable potential for seasonal storage of the energy extracted from the solar heating system. For further studies, the interactions between the heat storage and the surrounding ground should be studied in a 3 -dimensional conduction program. Insulation regarding snow should also be implemented in a future model to study the effect of extra insulation on the ground surface. </p...|$|R
40|$|A {{laboratory}} study of infiltration rates into frozen and unfrozen fine sand, including temperature effects of both soil and infiltration water, is reported. The {{average infiltration rate}} varied from about 10. 6 mm/min for unfrozen conditions, to about 1 - 2 mm/min for frozen conditions. A new numerical method for solving the phase change in unsaturated freezing and thawing soils is presented. The governing equations are solved by a two-step approach. In the first step, the heat and water flow equations, neglecting changes in ice content, are solved using a fully implicit numerical scheme. In the second step, the phase change is directly solved using a total energy balance and a relationship between unfrozen water content and freezing temperature (SWFC). Simulations of three horizontal freezing experiments using different time-dependent temperature boundary conditions (T b. c) are evaluated and discussed. Results from a simulated freezing and thawing cycle are also discussed. A good agreement between measured and calcuted temperature and moisture content profiles for different temperature boundary conditions was achieved. The freezing and thawing simulation demonstrated how the ice growth continued during thawing at the cold side of the ice zone, caused by a very small freezing temperature, and how the frost (ice) depth differed considerably from the depth at which 0 °Coccurred. Moreover, in the melt zone, water moved from the melt front towards the zone with the maximum ice content. Some characteristic parameters in the modelling of unsaturated freezing and thawing silt loam were studied. Closed-form expressions for soil-hydraulic properties were combined with the concept that relates soil water potential to freezing-point depression, to obtain the SWFC. The highest sensitivities resulted from variations of T b. c and initial moisture contents. For example, freezing-induced moisture accumulation only occurred in the initially wettest soil profile by the largest amounts for T b. c of less strength. Significant discrepancies occurred, in several phenomena, between soil types. One soil type had direct solid-to-solid contacts (SS) and the other had particles which were always separated by liquid water (SLS). The phenomena were ice contents, differences between the position of 0 °C and <b>frost</b> depth, melt <b>zones,</b> {{and the time of}} thawing. A similar sensitivity pattern was found when comparing wetting and drying characteristics, although the sensitivities were low. Freezing-induced moisture and ice accumulations, penetration rate of maximum frost depth and melt zone extension were strongly dependent of the hydraulic conductivity. For example, total moisture and ice contents changed by about ± 4. 5 % and ± 10 %, respectively, for T b. c. of the lowest strength, based on conductivity changes of ± 50 %, which e. g. is the changes of the conductivity when comparing the effects of the water viscosity for temperatures between 0 and + 20 °C. Studied phenomena during freezing, including time of thawing,were insensitive to changes of an impedence parameter, which is normally used in numerical modelling to reduce the hydraulic conductivity close to the freezing front.
