Although there is no record of Ruisdael owning land or shares, he appears to have lived comfortably, even after the economic downturn of the disaster year 1672.

In a large sample of <b>inventories</b> between 1650 and 1679 the average price for a Ruisdael was 40 guilders, compared to an average of 19 guilders for all attributed paintings.

Berry and his brothers and nephews had goldsmiths on salaries or retainers for what must have been a continuous flow of commissions, whose results are tersely catalogued in various <b>inventories</b> of the period, but of which there are now only a handful of survivals. Only one item mentioned in the records of the Berry collection might match the reliquary, but this was made after 1401, which conflicts with the date suggested by the heraldry.

50|$|From a {{financial}} accounting perspective, backflushing {{is a technique}} of the perpetual <b>inventory</b> system. Small businesses which have a rather modest variety of items in their <b>inventory</b> still use periodic <b>inventory</b> management. A periodic <b>inventory</b> system does not require day-to-day tracking of physical <b>inventory.</b> Purchases, cost of goods sold, and <b>inventory</b> on hand cannot be tracked {{until the end of}} the accounting time period when a physical <b>inventory</b> is performed and ending <b>inventory</b> is compared against the sum of beginning <b>inventory</b> and purchases. Cost of ending <b>inventory</b> can be calculated by using the LIFO or FIFO <b>inventory</b> accounting methods, or other less common methods. The end of the accounting period is considered usually the end of each month because otherwise some taxes like the VAT (value added tax) cannot be charged. The monthly stock-taking is the main disadvantage of the periodic <b>inventory</b> system. Another disadvantage is that it requires also monthly a reconciliation between the records of the management accounting and the financial accounting.|$|R
