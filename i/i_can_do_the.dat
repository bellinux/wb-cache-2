His beliefs matter to him {{both on and off}} the track: [...] "I'm a religious man, so I really believe in my God-given ability, that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> unexpected. I really do believe I can break a record, or come close to it, or win a medal." [...] He is frequently described as a modest and respectful athlete.|$|E
2500|$|On November 30, 1995, Weld {{announced}} that he would challenge incumbent Democratic Senator John Kerry in the 1996 election. Weld, who was among the first reasonably well-funded Republican Senate candidates in Massachusetts since Edward Brooke was unseated in 1978, said of the race, [...] "I've spent some time recently considering where <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> most good for the people of Massachusetts, and right now the fights that matter most to the people of this state are in another arena, Congress." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prior to {{the start}} of the 1965 season, Womack claimed that he was ready to pitch at the Triple-A level, the highest level of American {{professional}} baseball below the major leagues. [...] "I've had three pretty good years in a row", he said, [...] "I feel <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job." [...] Womack received his wish, as he was assigned to the Triple-A Toledo Mud Hens on May 3. He went 10–4 with a 2.17 ERA in 34 games that season, making a return {{to the start}}ing rotation as he started 13 games, six of which he completed. In 145 innings, he allowed 110 hits and 41 walks, striking out 73 batters. Though he did not lead the International League or his team in any categories, he finish second on the squad in victories (tied with Jack Curtis), winning percentage (.714), shutouts (three), innings pitched, walks and wild pitches (five, tied with Tom Dukes). Following the season, to ensure no other team could claim him, the Yankees added Womack to their 40-man roster and on October 19, he was promoted to the New York Yankees.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the film}} Razieh, a strong-willed {{little girl in}} Tehran, wants to buy a lucky {{goldfish}} for the upcoming Iranian New Year celebration, but struggles to get and {{hold on to the}} 500-toman banknote needed to purchase the fish. Panahi worked closely with Mohammadkhani, gaining her trust and acting out each scene for her to mimic while still adding her own personality to the performance. Panahi was most concerned about Mohammadkhani being able to cry on cue, so he would have her stare at him off camera while he started to cry, causing her to cry. Filming began in early April 1994 in Kashan, Iran and continued until early June. Panahi has stated that during the making of his feature debut he [...] "wanted to prove to myself that <b>I</b> <b>can</b> <b>do</b> <b>the</b> job, that I can finish a feature film successfully and get good acting out of my players." [...] He also stated that [...] "In a world where films are made with millions of dollars, we made a film about a little girl who wants to buy a fish for less than a dollar – this is what we’re trying to show." [...] In Iran, films depicting children are the most likely to avoid censorship or political controversy, and The White Balloon was screened exclusively in theatres that specialized in children's films. Because of this the film had low attendance on its initial run in Iranian theatres, with only 130,000 tickets sold.|$|E
