500|$|Guitarist John Frusciante and bassist Flea wrote much of [...] "Give It Away" [...] during jam {{sessions}} {{in the early}} 1990s. Following the Chili Peppers' tour in support of Mother's Milk (1989), the duo spent time in a side project called H.A.T.E. with members of Fishbone. During their tenure in the group, the guitarist and bassist created the main riff and accompanying bassline for [...] "Give It Away". The rhythm was played at several H.A.T.E. performances shortly thereafter, but when the side project disbanded Frusciante and Flea believed the track would be appropriate for the Chili Peppers' upcoming record. Vocalist Anthony Kiedis agreed, and upon hearing {{the rest of the}} Chili Peppers play the song he began chanting [...] "give it away, give it away, give it away now". The phrase had been something the vocalist intended to incorporate into a song for the band's new record, {{but it was not until}} he heard the bassline that the lyrics fit. Kiedis said, [...] "I was so struck by Flea's bass part, which covered the whole length of the instrument's neck, that <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> and marched over to the mic, my notebook in tow. I always had fragments of songs and ideas or even specific isolated phrases in mind." ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{became known}} for the victory celebration known as [...] "Rutten Jump", {{in which he would}} do a jumping split after winning a fight. Rutten talked about the origins of the Rutten Jump on his website: [...] "When I won my first fight in Pancrase, I was so hyped that <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> in the splits to each side of the ring. Why? I don't know. But, it became my {{trademark}} and I had to do it after every fight that I won." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hardly {{a moment}} later a gazelle came {{tripping}} into the room, a light-footed, brown-haired creature disguised as a young girl, untouched by the splendor into which she had been summoned, younger in her innocence than her probable sixteen years. She radiated timidity even more than beauty, an angelic gazelle, not from the ark but from heaven. <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up,</b> thinking to bar her entrance into this alcove of vice {{or at least to}} cut off her view of the poisoner on the wall, but Lucrezia, who never stopped playing her part, had irrepressibly taken the floor: ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Then, Pan, {{she began}} to cuss me, an' <b>I</b> <b>jumps</b> <b>up</b> mad, but right dignified an' says, 'Mrs. Somers, I'll require you to stop usin' profanity.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Upon my word, Mrs. Greene, I must deny that," [...] said <b>I,</b> <b>jumping</b> <b>up.</b> [...] "What {{on earth}} could I {{have done more}} than I did do? I have been to Milan and nearly fagged myself to death." ...|$|R
60|$|Here is a limping brute of a {{reply to}} your always-welcome Christmas letter! But, as usual, when I have done my day's work, <b>I</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> from {{my desk and}} rush into air and exercise, and find letter-writing the most {{difficult}} thing in my daily life.|$|R
2500|$|The {{children}} were {{asleep in the}} berths, and I was lying awake, listening to the sounds on the boat and wondering which part of the Sound we were on. [...] Suddenly there came a signal shrill whistle from our boat, and <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> and looked out of the window. [...] There was a big boat, bearing directly down on us. [...] She blew four times and began to back. [...] But still she came ahead towards us, and I {{could see she was}} going to cut into us. [...] I don't know what I thought or did. [...] I watched her coming on, and it seemed as if she went slowly, but still so fast. [...] Then she ground into us, and I ran to my baby. [...] The boat broke in all the side of the room, and the sound of smashing timbers and glass with the shock of the impact almost made me sick. [...] To add to the confusion, there were the shouts of the officers and the crew. [...] The cries of my little boys and girl. [...] The {{children were}} bruised by the collision, and none of us were able to save any clothing or any other personal belongings.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up,</b> {{drew back}} the curtain, {{and for a}} moment stood appalled.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up.</b> Poirot {{followed}} {{me down the}} narrow stairs. Mary Cavendish {{was standing in the}} doorway.|$|E
6000|$|She didn’t get {{any further}} because <b>I</b> had <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> and frightened her by shouting: “Is she ill? What has happened? Have {{you had a}} letter?” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] {{the hunter}} said; [...] "directly {{you stand up}} to get on horse they see you {{and get ready to}} shoot; the horse fall dead before he reach them. I will crawl through the grass; they will not see me till I get to them-- perhaps I get through without them seeing at all; if not, <b>I</b> <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> sudden and run; they all surprised, no shoot straight; once through line they never catch me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Amen!" [...] <b>I</b> answered, <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> with a laugh. [...] "And now, {{if we are}} to see {{the world}} in a month, there is no time to lose. Let us begin with the Hardtwald." ...|$|R
60|$|And {{then the}} man started to come down. As soon as he touched the ground <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> at him.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> to peer {{over the}} stone. Steele lumbered up beside me, and I heard him draw his breath hard.|$|E
6000|$|... "What {{disturbs}} you? What are you {{staring at}} the book for? I thought for an instant that {{you must have been}} overcome again!" [...] <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "'Of course,' I said, 'I'll {{take you}} round myself. By the bye,' <b>I</b> added, <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> and looking on the mantelpiece, 'I've got a card for a Cinderella at their place--something {{to do with}} a birthday. Will you be Smythe on November the twentieth?' ...|$|R
5000|$|She said in one {{interview}} on modelling: [...] "It was like, I {{wanted to go}} swimming in the ocean, but <b>I</b> was <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> and down in a puddle." [...] It is said that the title of her album 'I'd Rather Eat Glass' is a reference to what she'd rather do than go back to modeling.|$|R
6000|$|Before long, {{however, the}} driver {{pointed out the}} ford of Coilantogle. The instant he said this <b>I</b> half <b>jumped</b> <b>up,</b> and, seizing Jone by the arm, I cried, [...] "Don't you remember? This {{is the place where}} the Knight of Snowdoun, James Fitz-James, fought Roderick Dhu!" [...] And then without caring who else heard me, I burst out with: ...|$|R
60|$|At length I fell asleep. When I awoke it was daylight. <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> {{and looked}} at Duncan. He was just stirring, {{and a moment later}} he opened his eyes.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> in a {{state of}} ecstasy. Just as I had thrown my arms round Mrs. Staveley's neck, the servant came in with a letter, and handed it to me.|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up,</b> took my muff and umbrella, and hastened {{into the}} inn-passage: {{a man was}} {{standing}} by the open door, and in the lamp-lit street I dimly saw a one-horse conveyance.|$|E
6000|$|... "Willingly," [...] said <b>I,</b> and, <b>jumping</b> <b>up,</b> <b>I</b> led the way. As {{we turned}} to go, I {{observed}} that the old gentleman with the gold-headed cane was leaning over the rail of the pier at {{a short distance from}} us. A feeling of anger instantly rose within me, and I exclaimed, loud enough for him to hear-- ...|$|R
6000|$|... "'I'm ready now,' says <b>I,</b> <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> in a hurry. But I had to {{sit down}} again, for my feet were all cut and bleeding, and my {{slippers}} just rags. They fixed me up and off I went, to find mother in a sad taking. But Joe was all right; he hadn't broken his leg, but only sprained it badly, and being the wounded one he was laid up longer than I. We both got well, however, and the first time Joe went out he hobbled over to our house. I was spinning again then, and thought I might need my wedding outfit, after all--On the whole, I guess we'll end the story here; young folks wouldn't care for that part." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes," [...] <b>I</b> answered, <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> in a rage, [...] "as you say, I have my lesson, {{and more}} of it than I want. So by your leave, I will now bid you farewell, hoping {{that when it comes}} to be your turn to learn this lesson, or a worse, Ayesha, as I am sure it will one day, for {{something}} tells me so, you may enjoy it more than I have done." ...|$|R
60|$|His hands dropped, {{his mouth}} opened in a gasp, {{his face turned}} green. The blow had made him horribly sick, and he sank back utterly helpless. <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> with a shout of triumph.|$|E
60|$|We {{were seated}} under the elm near the spring, {{and at that}} instant I saw Tom coming toward us. <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up,</b> {{thinking}} to please him by this intelligence, when Colonel Clark pulled me down again.|$|E
60|$|This time <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up,</b> {{ran into}} the house, and got down some corn-pone and a leg of turkey. For that was {{the rule of the}} border. He took them in great bites, but slowly, and he picked the bones clean.|$|E
6000|$|... "I'm so sorry! Does it {{feel very}} painful? You can't think how {{constantly}} I've {{been thinking of}} you since the accident; for it was all my fault. If <b>I</b> hadn't <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> in such a passion, the pony wouldn't have run away, and you wouldn't have been hurt. I'm so very, very sorry, and I got dear papa to bring me {{here to tell you}} so, and {{to see if we could}} do anything to make you well." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I {{really started}} jumping by accident," [...] Lee recalls. [...] "They built this big sand pit and told {{all of the}} {{students}} to run and jump in it to see how far we could <b>jump.</b> <b>I</b> ended <b>up</b> winning it. I even remember exactly what <b>I</b> <b>jumped.</b> <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> like 16 feet, 9 inches. So, they ended up sending me to a prep school championship and did well there and then on into my high school years." ...|$|R
5000|$|Born in New York's Upper East Side, Cassidy {{is the son}} of {{the music}} agent Jonny Podell. Interested in deejaying from an early age, Cassidy {{describes}} himself as a [...] "hip-hop kid": [...] "When I was three years old, I would watch cult classic dance films Breakin' and Breakin' 2: Electric Boogaloo. When I was five years old, <b>I</b> would <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> and down on my bed to Run DMC. When I was 13, I idolized Grandmaster Flash, DJ Kool Herc, and Afrika Bambaataa. DJing was my way of contributing to the culture." ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{have always}} remembered the accent {{of those words}} as the most angelic bit of human {{utterance}} I had ever listened to; but then, almost {{with a sense of}} personal outrage, <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up.</b> [...] "Good heavens!" [...] I said, [...] "do you call that getting, it honestly?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Hear him! He came thunderin' {{right under}} my window. <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> in bed, an' when {{he let out}} that blast Jim lit square {{in the middle of}} the floor, an' I was scared stiff. Dick, seein' it was your room he blew into, what did you think?" ...|$|E
60|$|I wagged it now. The {{man looked}} at me rather distantly. He didn't pat me. I suspected--what I {{afterwards}} {{found to be the}} case--that he was shy, so <b>I</b> <b>jumped</b> <b>up</b> at him to put him at his ease. Mother growled again. I felt that she did not approve.|$|E
6000|$|... "No, I have not; he {{was close}} to Beresford when the {{fusiliers}} dashed up the hill; his horse fell dead, but he was not hit, for <b>I</b> saw him <b>jump</b> <b>up</b> all right. <b>I</b> did not see him afterwards. As he could not have got a fresh mount then, I expect he joined the fusiliers and went up the hill." ...|$|R
5000|$|Daniels was {{recalled}} {{to active}} duty June 2006 because the military needed his language skills. He later said: [...] "I {{wanted to go back}} so bad, <b>I</b> was <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> and down. The military was my life." [...] He served a year in Kuwait with the Navy Customs Battalion Romeo. Daniels has said that during this deployment he served openly without issue. In May 2007, he was profiled by Stars and Stripes in a cover story that chronicled his life serving in the Armed Forces as an openly gay man. He was discharged again under DADT when his tour ended later that year.|$|R
5000|$|His Western coach, Larry Haylor, said {{he remembers}} {{watching}} Tindale's first NFL touchdown while on vacation. [...] "We were huddled around a 7-inch TV screen. Tim broke {{a run for}} 44 yards {{and my wife and}} <b>I</b> were <b>jumping</b> <b>up</b> and down, cheering and screaming. People came storming into our room to see what was wrong." [...] Haylor also said [...] "I always said Tim would be the guy I would pick first if I had to choose a team. At 5'11", 220 pounds, he had very unusual talents. He's {{one of those guys who}} will give you his soul in effort." ...|$|R
