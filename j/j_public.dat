2500|$|Ali was an {{influential}} {{figure in the}} world of hip hop music. As a [...] "rhyming trickster", he was noted for his [...] "funky delivery", [...] "boasts", [...] "comical trash talk", and [...] "endless quotables". According to Rolling Stone, his [...] "freestyle skills" [...] and his [...] "rhymes, flow, and braggadocio" [...] would [...] "one day become typical of old school MCs" [...] like Run–D.M.C. and LL Cool J, and his [...] "outsized ego foreshadowed the vainglorious excesses of Kanye West, while his Afrocentric consciousness and cutting honesty pointed forward to modern bards like Rakim, Nas, Jay-Z, and Kendrick Lamar." [...] Ali has been cited as an inspiration by rappers such as LL Cool <b>J,</b> <b>Public</b> Enemy's Chuck D, Jay-Z, Eminem, Sean Combs, Slick Rick, Nas and MC Lyte. Ali has been referenced in a number of hip hop songs, including The Sugarhill Gang's [...] "Rapper's Delight", the Fugees' [...] "Ready or Not", EPMD's [...] "You're a Customer" [...] and Will Smith's [...] "Gettin' Jiggy wit It".|$|E
