The substance responsible for the antibacterial activity, determined to be heat-sensitive, was not identified. A number of chemicals have been isolated and identified from L.repraesentaneus that can regulate the growth of plants. The chemicals, in a class called sesquiterpenoids are named repraesentin A, and two related sesquiterpenes, namely repraesentins B and C. These compounds were shown to promote the radicle <b>elongation</b> of lettuce seedlings by 136%, 118% and 184% at 67 ppm, respectively. Other compounds reported in 2006 are repraesentins D, E, and F.

We repeat our calculation for different dumbbell <b>elongations</b> ζ. At high <b>elongations</b> (ζ > 0. 4), we find the same T_eff for the two observables. At low <b>elongations</b> (ζ≤ 0. 4), only for very deep quenches T_eff coincides.

40|$|To {{understand}} how neurons and nervous systems first evolved, {{we need an}} account of the origins of neural elongations: why did neural <b>elongations</b> (axons and dendrites) first originate, such that they could become the central component of both neurons and nervous systems? Two contrasting conceptual accounts provide different answers to this question. Braitenberg’s vehicles provide the iconic illustration of the dominant input–output (IO) view. Here, the basic role of neural <b>elongations</b> is to connect sensors to effectors, both situated at different positions within the body. For this function, neural <b>elongations</b> are thought of as comparatively long and specific connections, which require an articulated body involving substantial developmental processes to build. Internal coordination (IC) models stress a different function for early nervous systems. Here, the coordination of activity across extended parts of a multicellular body is held central, in particular, for the contractions of (muscle) tissue. An IC perspective allows the hypothesis that the earliest proto-neural <b>elongations</b> could have been functional even when they were initially simple, short and random connections, as long as they enhanced the patterning of contractile activity across a multicellular surface. The present computational study provides a proof of concept that such short and random neural <b>elongations</b> can play this role. While an excitable epithelium can generate basic forms of patterning for small body configurations, adding <b>elongations</b> allows such patterning to scale up to larger bodies. This result supports a new, more gradual evolutionary route towards the origins of the very first neurons and nervous systems...|$|R

25|$|Once a 16:0 carbon {{fatty acid}} has been formed, it can undergo {{a number of}} modifications, {{resulting}} in desaturation and/or <b>elongation.</b> <b>Elongation,</b> starting with stearate (18:0), is performed mainly in the ER by several membrane-bound enzymes.

25|$|The <b>elongation</b> phase starts once {{assembly}} of the <b>elongation</b> complex has been completed, and progresses until a termination sequence is encountered. The post-initiation movement of RNA polymerase is the target of another class of important regulatory mechanisms. For example, the transcriptional activator Tat affects <b>elongation</b> rather than initiation during its regulation of HIV transcription. In fact, many eukaryotic genes are regulated by releasing a block to transcription <b>elongation</b> called promoter-proximal pausing. Pausing can influence chromatin structure at promoters to facilitate gene activity and lead to rapid or synchronous transcriptional responses when cells are exposed to an activation signal. Pausing {{is associated with the}} binding of two negative <b>elongation</b> factors, DSIF (SPT4/SPT5) and NELF, to the <b>elongation</b> complex. Other factors can also influence the stability and duration of the paused polymerase. Pause release is triggered by the recruitment of the P-TEFb kinase.|$|E
40|$|Platelet-decorated von Willebrand factor (VWF) strings {{anchored}} to the endothelial surface are rapidly cleaved by ADAMTS 13. Individual VWF string characteristics such as number, location, and auxiliary features of the ADAMTS 13 cleavage sites were explored here using imaging and computing software. By following changes in VWF string length, we demonstrated that VWF strings are cleaved multiple times, successively shortening string length in the function of time and generating fragments {{ranging in size from}} 5 to over 100 mu m. These are larger than generally observed in normal plasma, indicating that further proteolysis takes place in circulation. Interestingly, in 89 % of all cleavage events, VWF strings elongate precisely at the cleavage site before ADAMTS 13 proteolysis. These local <b>elongations</b> are a general characteristic of VWF strings, independent of the presence of ADAMTS 13. Furthermore, large <b>elongations,</b> ranging in size from 1. 4 to 40 mu m, occur at different sites in space and time. In conclusion, ADAMTS 13 -mediated proteolysis of VWF strings under flow is preceded by large <b>elongations</b> of the string at the cleavage site. These <b>elongations</b> may lead to the simultaneous exposure of many exosites, thereby facilitating ADAMTS 13 -mediated cleavage. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|Transcription <b>elongation</b> is not {{a smooth}} ride along the DNA railway. For proofreading, the {{polymerase}} is made to back-up, erase some of the RNA it has already made and have another go at transcription. In general, RNA polymerase does not transcribe through a gene at a constant pace. Rather it pauses periodically at certain sequences, sometimes {{for long periods of}} time before resuming transcription. In extreme cases, for example, when the polymerase encounters a damaged nucleotide, it comes to a complete halt. More often, an elongating polymerase is stalled near the promoter. Promoter-proximal pausing during early <b>elongation</b> is a commonly used mechanism for regulating genes poised to be expressed rapidly or in a coordinated fashion. Pausing is mediated by a complex called NELF (negative <b>elongation</b> factor) in collaboration with DSIF (DRB-sensitivity-inducing factor containing SPT4/SPT5). The blockage is released once the polymerase receives an activation signal, such as the phosphorylation of Ser-2 of CTD tail by P-TEFb. Other <b>elongation</b> factors such as ELL and TFIIS stimulate the rate of <b>elongation</b> by limiting the length of time that polymerase pauses.|$|E

25|$|Among the {{proteins}} recruited to polymerase are <b>elongation</b> factors, thus called because they stimulate transcription <b>elongation.</b> There are different classes of <b>elongation</b> factors. Some factors {{can increase the}} overall rate of transcribing, some can help the polymerase through transient pausing sites, and some can assist the polymerase to transcribe through chromatin. One of the <b>elongation</b> factors, P-TEFb, is particularly important. P-TEFb phosphorylates the second residue (Ser-2) of the CTD repeats (YSPTSPS) of the bound Pol II. P-TEFb also phosphorylates and activates SPT5 and TAT-SF1. SPT5 is a universal transcription factor that helps recruit 5'-capping enzyme to Pol II with a CTD phosphorylated at Ser-5. TAF-SF1 recruits components of the RNA splicing machinery to the Ser-2 phosphorylated CTD. P-TEFb also helps suppress transient pausing of polymerase when it encounters certain sequences immediately following initiation.|$|E
