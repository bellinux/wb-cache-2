40|$|This {{paper is}} an attempt to come to a better {{understanding}} of <b>desire</b> through an examination of certain kinds of conflict of <b>desire.</b> Standard accounts of conflict of <b>desire</b> involve a two-part analysis. First, <b>desires</b> are held to conflict just in case the satisfaction of one precludes the satisfaction of the other; second, a <b>desire</b> is said to be satisfied just in case the propositional content of the <b>desire</b> is true. I argue that this account of conflict rests in an inadequate notion of <b>desire</b> satisfaction, and suggest a revision of our understanding of <b>desire</b> satisfaction to yield a better account of conflict of <b>desire.</b> This account of satisfaction requires that we recognize as a fundamental feature of <b>desire,</b> alongside the <b>desire</b> ’s strength and content, the <b>desire</b> ’s role.

40|$|Studies {{indicate}} that while suppressing smoking thoughts increases subsequent smoking, {{it may have}} no impact on <b>desire</b> to smoke. However, previous research has examined suppression of general smoking thoughts rather than thoughts specifically related to <b>desire</b> to smoke. The present study investigated whether suppression of thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke results in subsequently elevated ratings of <b>desire</b> to smoke. An experimental study {{examined the effects of}} suppressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke, versus expressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke, versus a control group thinking about anything, on ratings of <b>desire</b> to smoke and tobacco withdrawal symptoms at four time points (before manipulations, just after manipulations, 5 min after, 10 min after). In addition, effects of suppressing thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke on subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke were examined. Suppressing the thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke caused thought rebound (i. e., greater subsequent reports of thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke). However, compared with control groups, this suppression did not elevate subsequent ratings of <b>desire</b> to smoke. Suppressing the thoughts of <b>desire</b> to smoke does not elevate subsequent ratings of this <b>desire.</b> Increased cigarette consumption following suppression of smoking thoughts may be mediated by mechanisms other than increased <b>desire</b> to smoke...|$|R

40|$|The desire-satisfaction {{theory of}} welfare says {{that what is}} {{basically}} good for a subject is the satisfaction of his <b>desires.</b> One challenge to this view is the existence of quirky <b>desires,</b> such as a <b>desire</b> to count blades of grass. It {{is hard to see}} why anyone would <b>desire</b> such things, and thus hard to believe that the satisfaction of such <b>desires</b> could be basically good for anyone. This suggests that only some <b>desires</b> are basically good when satisfied, and that <b>desire</b> satisfactionists owe us an account of which <b>desires</b> these are, and why. In "Quirky <b>Desires</b> and Well-Being," Donald Bruckner proposes such an account: a <b>desire</b> is welfare-relevant (i. e., such that its satisfaction would be basically good for its subject) if and only if and because its subject could describe its object {{in a way that makes}} it comprehensible what about the object attracts him or appeals to him. We are inclined to view quirky <b>desires</b> as welfare-irrelevant because we assume that their objects cannot be described in such a way. But if there were a quirky <b>desire</b> whose object could be so described by the subject whose <b>desire</b> it is, then this <b>desire</b> would be relevant to that subject's welfare. I will argue that while Bruckner's view delivers plausible verdicts about the cases to which it is meant to apply, its account of what makes a <b>desire</b> welfare-relevant is unmotivated and implausible. <b>Desire</b> satisfactionists can retain what is plausible about his view while endorsing a better explanation of why welfare-relevant <b>desires</b> have that status if they accept the following account instead: a <b>desire</b> is welfare-relevant if and only if and because something about its object attracts, or appeals to, the subject who has the <b>desire...</b>|$|R

50|$|In Aristotle's De Anima {{the soul}} is seen to be {{involved}} in motion, because animals <b>desire</b> things and in their <b>desire,</b> they acquire locomotion. Aristotle argued that <b>desire</b> is implicated in animal interactions and the propensity of animals to motion. But Aristotle acknowledges that <b>desire</b> cannot account for all purposive movement towards a goal. He brackets the problem by positing that perhaps reason, in conjunction with <b>desire</b> and by way of the imagination, makes it possible for one to apprehend an object of <b>desire,</b> to see it as desirable. In this way reason and <b>desire</b> work together to determine what is a good object of <b>desire.</b> This resonates with <b>desire</b> in the chariots of Plato's Phaedrus, for in the Phaedrus {{the soul is}} guided by two horses, a dark horse of passion and a white horse of reason. Here passion and reason, as in Aristotle, are also together. Socrates does not suggest the dark horse be done away with, since its passions make possible a movement towards the objects of <b>desire,</b> but he qualifies <b>desire</b> and places it in a relation to reason so that the object of <b>desire</b> can be discerned correctly, so that we may have the right <b>desire.</b> Aristotle distinguishes <b>desire</b> into appetition and volition.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{defends the}} actualist desire-satisfaction theory of welfare against a popular line of objection—namely, that it cannot {{accommodate}} the fact that, sometimes, {{it is bad}} {{for a person to}} get what he wants.

40|$|Sexual <b>desire</b> {{is deeply}} {{embedded}} in interpersonal relationships and cannot be fully understood outside of this context. As such, research that focuses on sexual <b>desire</b> problems {{at the level of}} the couple is critical for more fully understanding the nature and consequences of such difficulties. In this research, I focus on one interpersonal aspect of <b>desire</b> termed sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy, or the difference between two romantic partners’ sexual <b>desire</b> levels. Given that <b>desire</b> levels tend to fluctuate over time, discrepancies in sexual <b>desire</b> are an inevitable feature of sexual relationships. However, we know little about how such <b>desire</b> discrepancies relate to sexual outcomes for couples. Past studies that have examined the association between sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy and sexual satisfaction in college/university samples have had inconsistent findings. Also, the results may not generalize to more established romantic relationships. The current study compared two different conceptualizations of sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy; perceived sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy was assessed by asking a participant to subjectively compare his/her own level of sexual <b>desire</b> to that of his/her partner. Actual <b>desire</b> discrepancy was computed by subtracting the female partner's score on a self-report measure of sexual <b>desire</b> from the male partner’s score on the same measure. In Sample 1, I examined the relationship between actual sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy and sexual satisfaction for 82 couples in committed, long-term relationships. In Sample 2, I investigated the association between perceived sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy and sexual satisfaction for 191 individuals in committed, long-term relationships. Results showed that higher perceived, but not actual, <b>desire</b> discrepancy was associated with lower sexual satisfaction. Additionally, I found that perceived <b>desire</b> discrepancy outcomes differed when measured using different response scales. Findings highlight methodological issues to consider when measuring sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy and extend the literature by showing that perceived sexual <b>desire</b> discrepancy is associated with sexual satisfaction for couples in committed, long-term relationships. Limitations of the current study and implications for future research are discussed...|$|R
