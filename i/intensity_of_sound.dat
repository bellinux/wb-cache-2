25|$|His first {{published}} papers, {{which appeared in}} 1842 and 1843, were on the steady motion of incompressible fluids and some cases of fluid motion. These were followed in 1845 by one on the friction of fluids in motion and the equilibrium and motion of elastic solids, and in 1850 by another {{on the effects of}} the internal friction of fluids on the motion of pendulums. To the theory of sound he made several contributions, including a discussion of the effect of wind on the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> and an explanation of how the intensity is influenced {{by the nature of the}} gas in which the sound is produced. These inquiries together put the science of fluid dynamics on a new footing, and provided a key not only to the explanation of many natural phenomena, such as the suspension of clouds in air, and the subsidence of ripples and waves in water, but also to the solution of practical problems, such as the flow of water in rivers and channels, and the skin resistance of ships.|$|E

5000|$|Besides the {{advertisement}} displays accomplished through monogamous pairing, territorial domination by longnose butterflyfish {{has also been}} observed by means of acoustic behaviors, which provide important cues and social signals during fish communication. [...] Emitting sounds through complicated body movements is another technique they use to advertise territorial boundaries. Potential rivals are able to assess body size of a competitor based on the duration and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sound</b> a yellow longnose butterflyfish produces. The duration and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> the <b>sounds</b> emitted during antagonistic behaviors, such as the defense of one's territory, often predict the ability of an individual to secure that territory. A <b>sound</b> <b>of</b> long duration and high intensity, therefore, often indicates an individual has a large territory. Defending territory is the strategy these species adopt to compete for and maximize their claims over resources.|$|R
40|$|The {{barn owl}} determines the {{directions}} from which sounds emanate by computing the interaural {{differences in the}} timing and <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounds.</b> These cues for sound localization are processed in independent channels originating at nucleus magnocellularis (NM) and nucleus angularis (NA), the cochlear nuclei. The cells of NM are specialized for encoding the phase <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> in the ipsilateral ear. The cells of NA are specialized for encoding the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> in the ipsilateral ear. NM projects solely, bilaterally, and tonotopically to nucleus laminaris (NL). NL and NA project to largely nonoverlapping zones in the central nucleus of the inferior colliculus (ICc), thus forming hodological subdivisions in which time and intensity information may be processed. The terminal field of NL occupies a discrete zone in the rostromedial portion of the contralateral ICc, which we have termed the “core” of ICc. The terminal field of NA surrounds the core of ICc and thus forms a “shell” around it. The projection from NL to the core conserves tonotopy. Low-frequency regions of NL project to the dorsal portions of the core whereas higher-frequency regions project to more ventral portions. This innervation pattern is consistent with earlier physiological studies of tonotopy. Physiological studies have also suggested that NL and the core of ICc contain {{a representation of the}} location <b>of</b> a <b>sound</b> source along the horizontal axis. Our data suggest that the projection from NL to the core preserves spatiotopy. Thus, the dorsal portion of NL on the left, which contains a representation of eccentric loci in the right hemifield, innervates the area of the right ICc core that represents eccentric right loci. The more ventral portion of the left NL, which represents loci close to the vertical meridian, innervates the more rostral portions of the right core, which also represents loci near the vertical meridian...|$|R
40|$|Cílem práce bylo zhodnotit vliv individuální fyzioterapie temporomandibulárních poruch (TMP) a ověřit trvání efektu terapie u těchto potíží po dvou měsících od ukončení individuální fyzioterapie. Bylo vyšetřeno 23 probandů, 17 žen a 6 mužů, s průměrným věkem 36, 5 roku. Hodnocena byla účinnost individuální fyzioterapie na výskyt a intenzitu bolesti v oblasti temporomandibulárního kloubu (TMK), na rozsah abdukce v čelistním kloubu a na intenzitu zvukových fenoménů při pohybech dolní čelisti. Pacient byl nejdříve vyšetřen stomatologem, který po vyšetření doporučil individuální fyzioterapii. Efekt individuální fyzioterapie byl posuzován na změnách intenzity bolesti, na přítomnosti nebo absenci reflexních změn v měkkých tkáních žvýkacích svalů a m. digastricus, na změně velikosti otevírání úst a na intenzitě zvukových fenoménů při pohybech dolní čelisti. Po ukončení terapie jsme zjistili, že individuální fyzioterapie u TMP vede ke statisticky významnému (p < 0, 001) snížení subjektivně vnímané intenzity bolesti v TMK – z 4, 2 bodu na vizuální analogové škále (VAS) na 0, 7 bodu. Došlo také ke snížení počtu reflexních změn ve svalech a fasciích. Po individuální fyzioterapii došlo také ke statisticky významnému (p < 0, 001) zvětšení rozsahu abdukce v čelistním kloubu (z 37, 3 mm na 41, 3 mm) a ke statisticky významnému (p < 0, 001) snížení intenzity zvukových fenoménů při pohybech dolní čelisti (z původních 100 % na 43 %). Dále jsme prokázali přetrvávání efektu individuální fyzioterapie i další zlepšení po dvou měsících od ukončení terapie u těchto sledovaných charakteristik: intenzity bolesti (p < 0, 001), rozsahu pohybu (p < 0, 003) a zvukových fenoménů (p < 0, 001). The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of individual specific physiotherapy in the treatment of temporomandibular disorders, its immediate effect and its effect after two months. The research sample was comprised of 23 subjects, 17 women and 6 men, with an average age of 36. 5 years. They complained <b>of</b> pain, <b>sound</b> phenomena and restricted mandibular movements. The patients were first examined by a stomatologist who recommended physiotherapy. The effect of treatment was assessed according to the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> pain, the occurrence of reflex changes in soft tissues in the region of the masticatory muscles and digastricus muscle, the range of mouth opening and the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> produced by mandibular movements. It was found that after treatment pain was significantly reduced (p < 0. 001) at the temporomandibular joint (from 4. 2 points to 0. 7 point on the VAS). There were also fewer reflex changes in the muscles and fascias. The range of mouth opening increased significantly (from 37. 3 mm to 41. 3 mm, p < 0. 001) and the <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> <b>sounds</b> was reduced from 100 % to 43 % (p < 0. 001). The finding shows that this state was maintained two months later: <b>intensity</b> <b>of</b> pain (p < 0. 001), mouth opening (p < 0. 003) and reduction <b>of</b> <b>sound</b> phenomena (p < 0. 001).
