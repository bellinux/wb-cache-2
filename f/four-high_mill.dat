50|$|To {{minimize}} the roll diameter a four-high or cluster mill is used. A small roll diameter is advantageous because less roll is {{in contact with}} the material, which results in a lower force and power requirement. The problem with a small roll is a reduction of stiffness, which is overcome using backup rolls. These backup rolls are larger and contact {{the back side of the}} smaller rolls. A <b>four-high</b> <b>mill</b> has four rolls, two small and two large. A cluster mill has more than 4 rolls, usually in three tiers. These types of mills are commonly used to hot roll wide plates, most cold rolling applications, and to roll foils.|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} study the hot Compact Strip Production (CSP), <b>four-high</b> <b>mill</b> {{vibration}} characteristics, and vibration suppression method, the roller system structure stability was analyzed and calculated at first in the paper. And then, the mill stand gap was measured at field and its influence on roll transverse vibration was analyzed. The drum gear coupling effect on the roller system stability and the automatic balance conditions of the coupling transmission torque were studied; the influence of axial force caused by the roller cross on the system stability was analyzed. Finally, the roller transverse friction chatter vibration mechanics model was established; the simulation analysis was carried out with eliminating mill house-bearing clearance and adding floating support for coupling, respectively. And {{the characteristics of the}} roller “jump vibration” were studied. We applied copper gaskets to eliminate or reduce mill house-bearing clearance for suppressing the rolling mill vibration on the spot; the test results show that the roller transverse vibration was suppressed after eliminating clearance...|$|E
40|$|Transverse {{instability}} in <b>four-high</b> <b>mills</b> {{is controlled by}} the usual guiding methods which on occasions are inapplicable. Its main cause is tilting of the work rolls on their backing rolls. A simplified conception of the strain distribution yields a manageable relationship between asymmetry of load and the roll gap taper. The proximity change between the work and backing roll chocks due to tilting is large compared with the change by symmetrical load and is thus potentially suitable for a signal to control guiding. Transverse rigidity is considered...|$|R
40|$|Shape (or flatness) {{control for}} rolled steel strip is {{becoming}} increasingly important as customer requirements become more stringent. Automatic shape control is now more or less mandatory on all new <b>four-high</b> cold <b>mills,</b> but no comprehensive scheme yet exists on a Sendzimir mill. This {{is due to the}} complexity of the control system design on such a mill, where many more degrees of freedom for control exist than is the case with the <b>four-high</b> <b>mills.</b> The objective of the current work is to develop, from first principles, such a system; including automatic control of the As-U-Roll and first intermediate roll actuators in response to the measured strip shape. This thesis concerns itself primarily with the As-U-Roll control system. The material presented is extremely wide-ranging. Areas covered include the development of original static and dynamic mathematical models of the mill systems, and testing of the plant by data-logging to tune these models. A basic control system philosophy proposed by other workers is modified and developed to suit the practical system requirements and the data provided by the models. The control strategy is tested by comprehensive multivariable simulation studies. Finally, details are given of the practical problems faced when installing the system on the plant. These include problems of manual control inter-action bumpless transfer and integral desaturation. At the time of presentation of the thesis, system commissioning is still in progress and production results are therefore not yet available. Nevertheless, the simulation studies predict a successful outcome, although performance is expected to be limited until the first intermediate roll actuators are eventually included in the scheme also...|$|R

Orders were hard to secure, the operating rate was low, money was scarce, the bond interest had to be paid in scrip, and the equipment needed to be modernized. The new continuous hot mill built in 1928 needed to be remodeled, widened, and converted into a <b>four-high</b> strip <b>mill,</b> also new cold rolling facilities and equipment for stainless steel production were needed.

40|$|This work {{presents}} the modeling by the {{finite element method}} of the first cold rolling pass of a <b>four-high</b> <b>mill</b> at the CSN steel plant. For this purpose, a two dimensional model is proposed considering the work-roll as a rigid surface together with the assumptions of plane-strain state for the strip and material isotropy with nonlinear isotropic workhardening. A C-Mn steel strip with initial thickness of 3. 5 mm was first characterized by means of uniaxial tensile tests in specimens cut along the rolling direction to evaluate the work-hardening parameters. In the finite element model, the contact is defined {{by means of the}} Coulomb’s law to describe the friction between the work-roll and the strip surfaces. Moreover, the industrial back and forward tensions are also taken into account as prescribed conditions in the finite element model. The numerical predictions of the rolling load show a good agreement with the measured data and the forecasted value is determined with the slab-method...|$|E

Yet to assess overall energy efficiency, {{the production process}} {{must also be taken}} into account. This paper provides an insight into the energy-efficient production of magnesium strips up to 0, 8 mm in thickness based on twin-roll casting and strip rolling on an industrial scale, as developed at the Institute of Metal Forming at the Technical University Bergakademie Freiberg (Germany) in cooperation with MgF Magnesium Flachprodukte GmbH (Germ any).

40|$|Modelling of {{flat rolling}} {{processes}} has great interest {{not only from}} the point of view of process analysis but also for the industrial sectors because of the great amount of materials which are produced and consumed each year. In this work, the flat rolling process is analyzed by using FEM and considering different process conditions such as: reduction, velocity of the strip and friction coefficient, among others. Plane strain conditions will be assumed, which is in fine agreement with actual results. In order to evaluate deformations and stresses within both the strip and the rolls a two-dimensional meshing has been considered. This will allow us to determine the deflection of the rolls for different strip thickness. Moreover, a comparison between numerical and analytical results obtained by using the slab method approach is presented.

50|$|Cold rolling {{occurs with}} the metal below its {{recrystallization}} temperature (usually at room temperature), {{which increases the}} strength via strain hardening up to 20%. It also improves the surface finish and holds tighter tolerances. Commonly cold-rolled products include sheets, strips, bars, and rods; these products are usually smaller than the same products that are hot rolled. Because of the smaller size of the workpieces and their greater strength, as compared to hot rolled stock, <b>four-high</b> or cluster <b>mills</b> are used. Cold rolling cannot reduce the thickness of a workpiece as much as hot rolling in a single pass.|$|R
40|$|For a {{roll gap}} of {{continuous}} plastic forming, {{the determination of}} mechanical parameters of a rolling processing involves a multi-body elasto-plastic frictional contact problem. As {{one of the three}} important numerical analytic methods, the Boundary Element Method (BEM) is suitable for the solution of contact problems, and it shows superiority to the Finite Element Method (FEM) and Finite Difference Method (FDM) in these cases. However, when the contact objects become very complicated and large-scale discrete nodes are generated, there are inherent difficulties for the BEM, such as time-consuming problem, low efficiency, and so on. To solve these problems, a kind of Fast Multi-pole Boundary Element Method (FM-BEM) is proposed. Combining the Fast Multi-pole Method (FMM) with BEM opens up a new computational situation, especially when a high efficient solver named Generalized Minimal Residual Algorithm (GMRES (m)) is introduced. Then a node-to-surface frictional contact model and a programming-iteration algorithm are developed. On a PVM network parallel platform, the cold rolling process of 2030 <b>four-high</b> <b>mill</b> with a width-to-thickness ratio reaching 1850 is successfully simulated.

40|$|In this work, the {{finite-element method}} (FEM) {{is used to}} develop the {{governing}} equation of motion of the working roll of a <b>four-high</b> rolling <b>mill</b> and to study its vibration due to different process parameters. The working roll is modeled as an Euler Bernoulli beam by taking beam elements with vertical displacement and slope as the nodal degrees-of-freedom in the finite-element formulation. The bearings {{at the ends of}} the working rolls are modeled using spring elements. To calculate the forces acting on the working roll, the interaction between the working roll and the backup roll is modeled by using the work roll submodel, and the interaction between the working roll and the sheet is modeled by using the roll bite submodel (Lin et al., 2003, "On Characteristics and Mechanism of Rolling Instability and Chatter," ASME J. Manuf. Sci. Eng., 125 (4), pp. 778 - 786). Nodal displacements and velocities are obtained by using the Newmark Beta method after solving the governing equation of motion of the working roll. The transient and steady-state variation of roll gap, exit thickness profile, exit stress, and sheet force {{along the length of the}} strip have been found for different bearing stiffnesses and widths of the strip. By using this model, one can predict the shape of the outcoming strip profile and exit stress variation which will be useful to avoid many defects, such as edge buckling or center buckling in rolling processes...|$|R
