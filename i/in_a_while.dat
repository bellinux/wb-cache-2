5|$|On July 1, 2007, Kariya {{signed a}} three-year {{contract}} worth $18 million with the St. Louis Blues. In similar fashion to his signing with Nashville, his arrival in St. Louis marked one of the team's first notable free agent acquisitions <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> (arguably since the team signed Brendan Shanahan in 1991). While the Predators were a team on the rise when he joined them, the Blues had contrastingly missed the playoffs in the previous two seasons.|$|E
5|$|As {{the player}} moves from world to world, eradicating the Heartless, Chirithy has brief conversations {{with one of}} the Foretellers and another Chirithy {{regarding}} concerning events. Once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> the player return to Daybreak Town where they meet another Keyblade wielder named , who is part of a rival union. He wishes to explore a mysterious tower that lies within the center of the town, and against Chirithy's wishes, the player agrees to help find a way in. Ephemer, however, abandons the player to explore the tower himself. During the player's exploration, the tower is discovered to be the base of the Foretellers, and while there, the player is confronted by Master Ava, the Foreteller they had met previously. She challenges the player to test their strength, and afterwards tells the player they have sadness in their hearts, which links them to the darkness. Undeterred, the player continues their mission and later meets another Keyblade wielder named , who comes from Ephemer's union. She expresses an interest in further exploring the mysterious tower of the Foretellers. She and the player encounter warring Foretellers from different unions and new kinds of Heartless that are revealed to be corrupted Keyblade wielders as well as a dark vision of Chirithy called Nightmare Chirithy (who is the same Chirithy that had been speaking with the player's).|$|E
5|$|Reviewers {{praised the}} co-op mode highly but many disliked the single-player mode. Danielle Riendeau (Polygon) liked Monacos {{gameplay}} stating {{that it was}} fun with other people, but {{it seemed that the}} single-player mode needed work. James Murff (GameFront) said the co-op was ridiculously fun and has good replayability. Marty Sliva (IGN) said that Monaco provided one of the best co-op experiences he'd had <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> He stated that due to the gameplay and mechanics, {{it was one of the}} most unique and addictive games released in 2013. Scott Nichols (Digital Spy) said that the game contains lots to discover, but is best done cooperatively. Jeff Grubb (VentureBeat) praised the fact that the game works as both an arcade and a strategic game but said to skip it if the user wasn't planning on playing it cooperatively. Roger Hargreaves (Metro) liked the multiplayer mode more, but also praised the single-player mode calling it surprisingly compelling.|$|E

5|$|Right now, we are {{currently}} pursuing a long arch series for cable. We wondered, should we do a sequel to the first one or do we do a remake? We {{came up with a}} 'requel' – it's a sequel and a remake. We've been developing this for a while. It's a trilogy in four parts, and it really follows the continuing adventures of new people who are experiencing this phenomenon of a Klown invasion, and once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> you see some of the old guys pop up and hear their stories – find out what happened over the last 25 years. It's fucking great.|$|E
25|$|Water in {{a closed}} jar with an air space over it forms a two phase system. Most of the water is in the liquid phase, where it is held by the mutual {{attraction}} of water molecules. Even at equilibrium molecules are constantly in motion and, once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> a molecule in the liquid phase gains enough kinetic energy {{to break away from}} the liquid phase and enter the gas phase. Likewise, every once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> a vapor molecule collides with the liquid surface and condenses into the liquid. At equilibrium, evaporation and condensation processes exactly balance and there is no net change in the volume of either phase.|$|E

25|$|In the Western world, between 10 and 20% of the {{population}} are affected by GERD. Gastroesophageal reflux (GER) once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> without significant symptoms or complications, is more common. The condition was first described in 1935 by the American gastroenterologist Asher Winkelstein. The classic symptoms had been described earlier in 1925.|$|E
25|$|The {{following}} season heralded {{a change}} in the Hawks usual pattern; they finished fifth in ENIHL (missing out on playoffs), fifth in Northern League, and missed out on the playoffs in ENIHL cup on goal difference. However, for the first season <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> the team's top scorer was not Bobby Haig, but David Meikle, with 35 points in 16 games.|$|E
25|$|Reduplication is only {{marginally}} used in Esperanto. It has an intensifying effect {{similar to that}} of the suffix -eg-. The common examples are plenplena (chock-full), from plena (full), finfine (finally, at last), from fina (final), and fojfoje (once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while),</b> from foje (once, sometimes). So far, reduplication has only been used with monosyllabic roots that don't require an epenthetic vowel when compounded.|$|E

25|$|For first-order tableaux without unification, the {{condition}} of fairness is similar, with the exception that the rule for universal quantifier might require more than one application. Fairness amounts to expanding every universal quantifier infinitely often. In other words, a fair policy of application of rules cannot keep applying other rules without expanding every universal quantifier in every branch that is still open once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{initial entry}} charge per person was sixpence, {{which was a}} sizable sum {{at the time and}} limited {{admission}} to relatively wealthy middle-class people. What made Dublin Zoo very different from some of its contemporaries was a decision to reduce the charge to one penny on Sundays. This made a day at the zoo something that nearly every Dubliner could afford once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while</b> and it became very popular.|$|E

25|$|Yoshimi is {{a second}} year student from class 2-C, Leo's classmate {{and a member of}} the student council. She is popular with everyone, she is an honour student, is quick in her movements, is a good cook, and is sweet-tempered. She puts the brakes on Erika Kiriya once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> for Erika tends to go her own way without {{consulting}} anyone. She at first appears to be a very mature person, however, her true nature is quite the opposite. Erika is her close friend who understands her true self.

25|$|In {{the former}} Yugoslavia, cheek kissing {{is also very}} commonplace, with your {{nationality}} being ascertainable {{by the number of}} kisses on each cheek. Typically, Croats and Bosniaks will kiss once on each cheek, for two total kisses, whereas Serbs (be they from Bosnia, Croatia, Serbia or Montenegro) will kiss three times, typically starting at the right cheek. In Serbia and Montenegro, it is also not uncommon for men to kiss each other on the cheek three times as a form of greeting, usually for people they have not encountered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while,</b> while male-female and female-female kissing is also standard.|$|E
25|$|Filming for the storyline {{commenced}} during late November 2012 at FremantleMedia Australia's Melbourne {{studios and}} {{on location in}} Kangaroo Ground. The episodes were filmed over four days; the wedding ceremony and the reception scenes were shot {{in the first two}} days, with the explosion being shot on the third day and the aftermath on the fourth. Filming of the actual explosion took four hours and it was created using low-impact explosives and special effects. Two explosions were filmed from different angles and the scenes were then merged during post-production. The scene was one biggest stunts the show had shot <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E

25|$|He'd {{had some}} success, {{but then he}} {{had a series of}} setbacks. And there was also the scandal around The Warriors; any success had been eclipsed by the killings in the theaters. So there was that, as well as the noncommercial success of Southern Comfort and Long Riders and {{the fact that there was}} a writer's strike. All of that meant that Walter hadn't worked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Meaning a year or so. And what {{happened}} was the strike ended and the studios didn't have a lot of ready scripts. So this clever colleague, Larry Gordon, dusted off a script that had been shuttling around development and got it greenlit at Paramount with his friend Michael Eisner. And that script was 48 Hrs..|$|E
25|$|Sometimes an {{exhibition}} race is held {{after all the}} meaningful races are run with all the amateur class winners from Novice up to Expert and including the Open, girls classes and perhaps Cruiser classes race together once. This is called the Trophy Dash. Like in the Open Classes, no points are rewarded in this case, just a chance for bragging rights and to match yourself up against people that are at a higher skill level. Only one race for a single first-place trophy is awarded. As in the Opens the Expert usually wins with the Intermediate winner pulling one out every once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b> Novices usually win only when a major, catastrophic pile up occurs on the track and even then the mass smash up has to happen quite close to the finish line.|$|E
25|$|Directly east {{of these}} areas, the weather becomes much harsher: {{precipitation}} drops to between 150 and 300mm, the mountains no longer protect the cities from the wind, and temperatures become more extreme. Maquinchao {{is a couple}} hundred kilometers east of Bariloche, at the same altitude on a plateau, and summer daytime temperatures are usually about 5°C warmer, rising up to 35°C sometimes, but winter temperatures are much more extreme: the record is −35°C, {{and it is not}} uncommon to see some nights 10°C colder than Bariloche. The plateaus in Santa Cruz province and parts of Chubut usually have snow cover through the winter, and often experience very cold temperatures. In Chile, the city of Balmaceda is known for being situated in this region (which is otherwise almost exclusively in Argentina), and for being the coldest place in Chile, with temperatures below −20°C every once <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>while.</b>|$|E
