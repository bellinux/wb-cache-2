5|$|Henoch–Schönlein purpura (HSP), {{also known}} as IgA vasculitis, anaphylactoid purpura, purpura rheumatica, and Schönlein–Henoch purpura, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> of the skin, mucous membranes, and {{sometimes}} other organs that most commonly affects children. In the skin, the disease causes palpable purpura (small, raised areas of bleeding underneath the skin), often with joint pain and abdominal pain. With kidney involvement, {{there may be a}} loss of small amounts of blood and protein in the urine (hematuria and proteinuria), but this usually goes unnoticed; in a small proportion of cases, the kidney involvement proceeds to chronic kidney disease. HSP is often preceded by an infection, such as a throat infection.|$|E
5|$|In general, avian {{influenza}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> of birds caused by bird-specific influenza A virus {{that is not}} normally transferred to people; however, people in contact with live poultry are at the greatest risk of becoming infected with the virus and this is of particular concern {{in areas such as}} Southeast Asia, where the disease is endemic in the wild bird population and domestic poultry can become infected. The virus possibly could mutate to become highly virulent and infectious in humans and cause an influenza pandemic.|$|E
5|$|Poliomyelitis <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> of {{the central}} nervous system. However, CD155 is {{believed}} to be present on the surface of most or all human cells. Therefore, receptor expression does not explain why poliovirus preferentially infects certain tissues. This suggests that tissue tropism is determined after cellular infection. Recent work has suggested that the type I interferon response (specifically that of interferon alpha and beta) is an important factor that defines which types of cells support poliovirus replication. In mice expressing CD155 (through genetic engineering) but lacking the type I interferon receptor, poliovirus not only replicates in an expanded repertoire of tissue types, but these mice are also able to be infected orally with the virus.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} what it <b>is</b> for <b>a</b> {{condition to}} <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease.</b> It falls into two sections. In the first I examine the best existing account of disease (as proposed by Christopher Boorse) {{and argue that}} it must be rejected. In the second I outline a more acceptable account of disease. According to this account, by <b>disease</b> we mean <b>a</b> condition that it <b>is</b> <b>a</b> bad thing to have, that is such that we consider the afflicted person to have been unlucky, and that can potentially be medically treated. All three criteria must <b>be</b> fulfilled for <b>a</b> condition to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease.</b> The criterion that for <b>a</b> condition to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> it must <b>be</b> <b>a</b> bad thing <b>is</b> required to distinguish the biologically different from the diseased. The claim that the sufferer must be unlucky is needed to distinguish diseases from conditions that are unpleasant but normal, for example teething. Finally, the claim that for <b>a</b> condition to <b>be</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> it must <b>be</b> potentially medically treatable is needed to distinguish diseases from other types of misfortune, for example economic problems and legal problems...|$|R

5|$|Rinderpest, {{which is}} caused by a virus closely related to measles virus, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> of cattle known since Roman times. The disease, which {{originated}} in Asia, was first brought to Europe by the invading Huns in 370. Later invasions of Mongols, led by Genghis Khan and his army, started pandemics in Europe in 1222, 1233 and 1238. The infection subsequently reached England following the importation of cattle from the continent. At the time rinderpest was a devastating disease with a mortality rate of 80–90%. The resulting loss of cattle caused famine.|$|E
5|$|Schizophrenia Genesis {{starts with}} the history of {{schizophrenia}}. Gottesman takes the view that schizophrenia <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> of the industrial world. because it is not mentioned in the Bible, by the ancient Greeks, the ancient physicians, or authors including Shakespeare. He saw it first mentioned by physicians in 1809 and by Balzac in a short story in 1832, showing minimally the disorder had by then been recognized as such. In 1896, Kraepelin defined its symptoms, and his student Ernst Rüdin began a genetic study of its transmission in 1916.} The book noted that schizophrenia existed across cultures and its rates had stayed steady for fifty years.|$|E
5|$|Serum copper is low, {{which may}} seem {{paradoxical}} given that Wilson's disease <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> of copper excess. However, 95% of plasma copper is carried by ceruloplasmin {{which is often}} low in Wilson's disease. Urine copper is elevated in Wilson's disease and is collected for 24 hours in a bottle with a copper-free liner. Levels above 100 μg/24h (1.6 μmol/24h) confirm Wilson's disease, and levels above 40 μg/24h (0.6 μmol/24h) are strongly indicative. High urine copper levels are not unique to Wilson's disease; they are sometimes observed in autoimmune hepatitis and in cholestasis (any disease obstructing the flow of bile from the liver to the small bowel).|$|E

25|$|According to Paul Baltes, the {{benefits}} granted by evolutionary selection decrease with age. Natural selection has not eliminated many harmful conditions and nonadaptive characteristics that appear among older adults, such as Alzheimer <b>disease.</b> If it <b>were</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> that killed 20-year-olds instead of 70-year-olds {{this may have}} <b>been</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> that natural selection could have eliminated ages ago. Thus, unaided by evolutionary pressures against nonadaptive conditions, modern humans suffer the aches, pains, and infirmities of aging and as {{the benefits}} of evolutionary selection decrease with age, the need for modern technological mediums against non-adaptive conditions increases.|$|R
5|$|The {{new edition}} of the Tiger Woods PGA Tour series of video games {{incorporates}} elements of the alleged physical altercations Woods had with his wife regarding his extramarital affairs, and resembles a fighting game more than a golf simulation. Cartman, Stan, Kyle and Kenny become big fans of the game. Meanwhile, scientists at the Center for Disease Control determine that sex addiction <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>disease</b> reaching epidemic proportions. They decide to screen schoolchildren for the disease, and Kenny, Kyle, and Butters are diagnosed as sex addicts. Kenny is killed after attempting autoerotic asphyxiation while in a Batman suit, while Kyle and Butters are sent to attend a therapy session for sex addicts consisting of Michael Douglas, Michael Jordan, Ben Roethlisberger, David Duchovny, Charlie Sheen, David Letterman, Bill Clinton, Billy Bob Thornton, Kobe Bryant, Eliot Spitzer, and Tiger Woods.|$|E
