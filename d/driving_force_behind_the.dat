A body of controversial research under the umbrella ofimplicit egotism, starting with Pelham, Mirenberg, and Jones, has investigated whether people unknowingly make life decisions based on their name letters or name. Sceptics say that to claim that a name or name letters influences life decisions is an extraordinary claim that requires extraordinary evidence.|$|E

5|$|The Council of Trent (1545–1563) {{became the}} <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Counter-Reformation in {{response}} to the Protestant movement. Doctrinally, it reaffirmed central Catholic teachings such as transubstantiation and the requirement for love and hope as well as faith to attain salvation. In subsequent centuries, Catholicism spread widely across the world despite experiencing a reduction in its hold on European populations due to the growth of religious scepticism during and after the Enlightenment.|$|E

He and his team developed computer interface elements such as bitmapped screens, the mouse, hypertext, collaborative tools, and precursors to the graphical user interface. He conceived and developed many of his user interface ideas in the mid-1960s, long before the personal computer revolution, {{at a time when most}} computers were inaccessible to individuals who could only use computers through intermediaries (see batch processing), and when software tended to be written for vertical applications in proprietary systems.|$|E

5|$|The Norfolk and Western Railway {{was one of}} {{the twenty}} railroads which joined Amtrak in 1971 but in the first four years hosted no {{passenger}} service over its route, the centerpiece of which was its main line between Norfolk and Cincinnati which passed through the state of West Virginia.

5|$|After leaving {{school at}} the age of 14, Mason got a job with the {{district}} bank while he attended night school in his spare time. He worked there until 1838, when he left {{at the age of}} 21 to join the family's cotton business. He became the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> business. The business thrived: by the early 1850s the Mason family had built two state-of-the-art cotton mills in the Ryecroft area of Ashton-under-Lyne, known as the Oxford Mills. He was able to purchase Groby Hall, in Ashton, the ancestral seat of the former Lord Greys of Groby.|$|E
5|$|Jocelin was a royal justiciar in 1203, {{as well as}} the {{custodian}} of {{the vacant}} diocese of Lincoln. He was a royal clerk as well as a canon of Wells, becoming a canon and a deacon by 1200. The previous bishop of Wells died in 1205, and on 3 February 1206, Jocelin was elected bishop. He was consecrated on 28 May 1206, at Reading by Bishop William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise of London.

5|$|The {{closely related}} field of letter-preference {{research}} {{dates back to}} the 1950s. In 1985, Belgian psychologist Nuttin reported the surprising finding that people tend to disproportionately prefer, unknowingly, the letters of their own name. The name-letter effect has been replicated in dozens of follow-up studies in different languages, cultures and alphabets, no matter whether participants selected their preferred letter from a random pair, or picked the top six of all letters in the alphabet, or rated each individual letter. Nuttin predicted that because the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> name-letter effect is an unconscious preference for anything connected to the self, there should also be a birthday-number effect.|$|E
5|$|Tom died of {{pancreatic}} cancer in July 1995—three years before {{construction of the}} park began. During a Chinatown Chamber of Commerce meeting held in March 1998, the Riverside Park Advisory Council suggested renaming the park in honor of Ping Tom, the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> its creation. The request was approved on August 3, 1998, and the park was renamed Ping Tom Memorial Park. The park was dedicated and officially opened by Chicago Mayor Richard M. Daley during a ceremony on October 2, 1999. In 2005, the CADC {{and friends of the}} Tom family commissioned sculptor Liao Huilana to create a bronze bust of Ping Tom. The bust was dedicated and installed at the park on October 22, 2005.|$|E
5|$|Aria of Sorrow {{takes place}} in the fictional {{universe}} of the Castlevania series. The series' premise is the conflict between the vampire hunters of the Belmont clan and the immortal vampire Dracula. Thirty-six years before the start of Aria of Sorrow, Dracula was defeated once and for all by the Belmont clan, and his powers sealed into a solar eclipse. Shortly after Dracula's death, a prophecy was made that Dracula's reincarnation would come to his castle in 2035 and inherit all of Dracula's powers. This prophecy acts as the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> plot of Aria of Sorrow, and is the primary motivation of the supporting characters to be present. The game {{takes place in}} Dracula's castle, the most common setting for the series, with the castle divided into numerous areas that the player traverses {{over the course of the}} game.|$|E

5|$|Development of {{the project}} was closely tied to the other two games, and Sneak Kings {{development}} was directly led by Burger King. The game started as a tile-based puzzle game, but quickly became a Spy vs Spy-style caper until Burger King made design choices that removed conventional hazards and competition elements in favor of a stealth game with no human opponents. Sneak King did not win critical acclaim and its reviews often reflected its unusual design elements, but the project was a financial success and resulted in millions of units being sold. Collectively, the games ranked amongst the top 10 best selling games of 2006. Burger King's Russell Klein would attribute the three game project as being the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> company's 40% quarterly sales increase.|$|E
5|$|In the 1940s, as the Indian {{independence}} movement intensified, an upsurge of Muslim nationalism helmed by the All-India Muslim League took place, of which Muhammad Ali Jinnah {{was the most}} prominent leader. Being a political party to secure {{the interests of the}} Muslim diaspora in British India, the Muslim League played a decisive role during the 1940s in the Indian {{independence movement}} and developed into the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> creation of Pakistan as a Muslim state in South Asia. During a three-day general session of All-India Muslim League from 22–24 March 1940, a formal political statement was presented, known as the Lahore Resolution, which called on for the creation of an independent state for Muslims. In 1956, 23 March also became the date on which Pakistan transitioned from a dominion to a republic, and is known as Pakistan Day.|$|E
5|$|Malta had {{organised}} the Consulato del Mare (Consulate of the Sea) for {{the first}} time on 1 September 1697 per initiative of Grandmaster Perellos. At the consulate it was decided that four merchants familiar enough with maritime procedures shall be appointed consuls to administer justice, on similar approach to Barcellona and Messina. Perellos had established foreign relations between Malta and Russia in 1698, {{for the first}} time, exactly a century before the Order's expulsion from Malta. During his grandmastership the coastal fortifications of Malta were strengthened by the construction of batteries, redoubts, and entrenchments. He also was the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> third rate squadron of the order which was eventually inaugurated in 1705.

5|$|The Alabama {{legislature}} {{passed the}} Cater Act in 1949, allowing {{cities and counties}} to set up industrial development boards (IDB) to issue municipal bonds as incentives to attract new industry into their local areas. The city of Mobile did not establish a Cater Act board until 1962. George E. McNally, Mobile's first Republican mayor since Reconstruction, was the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> founding of the IDB. The Mobile Area Chamber of Commerce, believing its members were better qualified to attract new businesses and industry to the area, considered the new IDB as a serious rival. After several years of political squabbling, the Chamber of Commerce emerged victorious. While McNally's IDB prompted the Chamber of Commerce to become more proactive in attracting new industry, the chamber effectively shut Mobile city government out of economic development decisions.|$|E
5|$|The West Hartlepool Harbour and Railway (WHH) and {{a number}} of landowners struck an {{agreement}} to construct a line from the Tees at Cargo Fleet via Normanby, Upsall and Guisborough to Skinningrove, with connecting links and branches to Staithes and Skelton-in-Cleveland. The line would connect to the WHH's own route north of the river via a crossing of the Tees. Several local landowners through which the proposed line ran were key to the scheme – Captain Thomas Chaloner of Guisborough, J.T. Wharton of Skelton Castle, Anthony Lax Maynard of Skinningrove and Ralph Ward Jackson of Greatham Hall, Normanby. Ward Jackson, who was the chairman of the WHH, was the <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> project and envisaged making West Hartlepool into the industrial heart of Teesside.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{forms of}} public film {{display in the}} country were Italian newsreels of key events during the colonial period. Growing out of the Somali people's rich storytelling tradition, the first few feature-length Somali films and cinematic festivals emerged in the early 1960s, immediately after independence. Following {{the creation of the}} Somali Film Agency (SFA) regulatory body in 1975, the local film scene began to expand rapidly. In the 1970s and early 1980s, popular musicals known as riwaayado were the main <b>driving</b> <b>force</b> <b>behind</b> <b>the</b> Somali movie industry. Epic and period films as well as international co-productions followed suit, facilitated by the proliferation of video technology and national television networks. In the 1990s and 2000s, a new wave of more entertainment-oriented movies emerged. Referred to as Somaliwood, this upstart, youth-based cinematic movement has energized the Somali film industry and in the process introduced innovative storylines, marketing strategies and production techniques.|$|E
