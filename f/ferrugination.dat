40|$|Gravelly clay loamy and clayey soils {{developed}} from the derivatives of ultramafic rocks of the dunite-harzburgite complex of the Rai-Iz massif in the Polar Urals have been studied. They are represented by raw-humus pelozems (weakly developed clayey soils) under conditions of perfect drainage on steep slopes and by the gleyzems (Gleysols) with vivid gley color patterns in the eluvial positions on leveled elements of the relief. The magnesium released from the silicates with the high content of this element (mainly from olivine) specifies the neutral-alkaline reaction in these soils. Cryoturbation, the accumulation of raw humus, the impregnation of the soil mass with humic substances, gleyzation, and the <b>ferrugination</b> of the gleyed horizons are also clearly pronounced in the studied soils. Despite the high pH values, the destruction of supergene smectites in the upper horizons and <b>ferrugination</b> (the accumulation of iron hydroxides) in the microfissures dissecting the grains of olivine, pyroxene, and serpentine, and in decomposing plant tissues take place. The development of these processes {{may be related to}} the local acidification (neutralization) of the soil medium under the impact of biota and carbonic acids. The specificity of gleyzation in the soils developing from ultra-mafic rocks is shown in the absence of iron depletion from the fine earth material against the background of the greenish blue gley color pattern...|$|E

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. Interest in the Lady Loretta area of N. W. Queensland is centred around {{the occurrence of}} stratiform lead-zinc mineralization in Lower Proterozoic rocks belonging to the Paradise Creek Formation. The mineralization is associated with two rock types: a) a contorted ‘bedded’ lead-zinc sulphide rock, b) a transposed barite, chert, pyrite, sphalerite rock. The host rocks are typically carbonaceous, pyritic and dolomitic pelites and psammopelites of locally variable thickness. Four (4) groups of folds have been recognized within the area: F 1 - caused by local intraformational slumping of the mineralized rocks (to which it is restricted) during diagenesis; responsible for the associated deformations of these rocks and helps to explain their compositional and thickness variability. F 2 - Associated with a chlorite zone greenschist facies metamorphic event and a fanned slaty cleavage; responsible for the macroscopic geometry of the area. F 3 	and F 4 - Locally developed as low amplitude folds and warps; associated with a poorly defined axial plane structure. Silicification and <b>ferrugination,</b> in association with both favourable climatic conditions and mineral assemblages, {{have been able to}} both preserve and accentuate the poorly developed structural elements associated with the fold groups above, and has thus enabled their documentation.

40|$|The article {{deals with}} the {{application}} of a comprehensive approach in predicting the localization of gold ore deposits in the gold mining areas of northern and eastern Kazakhstan. For a Zhumba ore zone, the ore-metasomatic system in the intrusive zone of a hidden granitoid massif was reconstructed by methods of system analysis. During the initial stages of its development, vast fields of hornfelsing were detedcted with zones of pyritization and <b>ferrugination</b> of the enclosing strata. It was found out that the intensity of manifestation of metasomatic processes and quartz vein bodies is uneven and is accompanied by formation of local clusters, called forth by isolation of the centres of ore-bearing silicate melts on the final stages of mineralization. Localization of gold mineralization takes place at all stages of the ore system formation. This is evidenced by the presence of free gold associated with sulfides in the ores. The author has detected the general regularities and principles of evolution of ore-forming systems in the case study of geological and genetic groups of deposits associated with granitoid magmatism of conflict geodynamic environments of Caledonian and Hercynian tectogenesis cycles. Particular importance is attached to the duration of functioning of the system of ore-controlling deep-lying faults of different orders, which furthered the introduction of intrusive-dyke series of gabbro-diorite-granodiorite-plagiogranite composition, the powerful development of metasomatism and ore formation processes...|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe geology of {{northern}} Tunisia {{is marked by}} magmatic extrusion {{that occurred during the}} Middle Miocene (Langhian-Lower Tortonian), which led to the outcrops of rhyodacites in the Nefza-Tabarka region. This event is contemporaneous with the Alpine compressional phase, which is well-characterised in the western Mediterranean area, where intense fracturing and hydrothermalism occurred with evidence of metallogenic consequences. In this paper, a detailed study is presented on the acid volcanic rocks that outcrop {{at the core of the}} Oued Belif structure in the Nefza area {{of northern}} Tunisia. The results indicate that these series have undergone various transformations subsequent to their extrusion. These alterations include <b>ferrugination,</b> silicification, argilitisation and devitrification of volcanic glass. Petrographic observations demonstrated that the primary minerals, particularly feldspars, biotite and mesostasis glass, were affected by hydrothermal and meteoric weathering. The mineralogical study of the neogenic products revealed a nearly monomineral smectitic phase with relatively low levels of added illite and/or kaolinite. These neoformed smectites were classified as ferroan beidellites-nontronite based on thermal and crystallochemical analyses. Chemical analysis of the major elements, trace elements and rare Earth elements (REEs) show the presence of Al, Fe and K and an enrichment of REE in the clay fraction with a greater fractionation of light rare Earth elements (LREEs) compared with that of heavy rare Earth elements (HREEs). The abundance of these elements is attributed to their mobility during chemical weathering of acidic lavas and their adsorption by clay mineral...|$|E
40|$|The Caspian Sea {{is subject}} to {{alternating}} transgressions and regressions that exert a strong impact on the topography, sediments, vegetation, and soils in coastal zones. The last transgression of the Caspian Sea (1978 - 1995) caused {{the development of a}} marsh-lagoon system along the accumulative seashore of the Central Dagestan. Salt marshes are complex and dynamic systems highly vulnerable to sea level fluctuations; therefore, they may be considered as a regional model of rapid environmental changes. Hazards in coastal zones may critically change the soil geochemistry affecting agricultural potential of large areas. Assessments of risks of the natural hazards in coastal zones are extremely difficult unless the end-to-end understanding of all natural factors. The research in the Caspian region shows the impact of extreme events in the coastal zones. Detailed landscape-geochemical investigations of the Caspian salt marshes were carried out in 1995 - 1996 (during the final stage of the transgression period) and in 2001 - 2003 (during the period of the sea level stabilization). These coastal areas are influenced by different landscape-geochemical processes, such as sulfidization, gleyzation, <b>ferrugination,</b> humus accumulation, halogenesis, and changes of alkali-acidic conditions. The development of the processes characterizes different stages of the Caspian Sea level fluctuations. This paper presents a discussion on stages and rates of landscape-geochemical processes, formation of geochemical barriers, and trace elements distribution in soils of the salt marshes.

40|$|Hydrothermal silica {{deposits}} {{occur in}} a small fault (dike) {{as well as in}} several veins located in the contact between the andesitic volcanic rocks (8. 1 - 8. 7 M years old) and the biocalcarenites (Upper Tortonian-lower Messinian) of the Agua Amarga area. The silica deposits have different colours (green, blue, greyish, white, red or brown etc.) and luminosity (shiny or matt surfaces). Their mineralogy was determined by X-ray diffraction (XRD), while their textures and microstructures were examined by transmitted light microscopy and scanning electron microscopy (SEM) with energy-dispersive X-ray microanalysis. The XRD analyses indicated that the dike and veins (which show mineral zonation) are made of opal CT, quartz, sepiolite and dolomite. The outer parts are formed only by sepiolite, the intermediate areas by mixtures of sepiolite and opal CT, and the inner areas sometimes only by quartz. Fe-(hydro) oxides give the green and red colours. Near these hydrothermal deposits, the biocalcarenites show dolomitization and <b>ferrugination.</b> Optical and SEM observations showed the dolomite to be superimposed on the opal CT- sepiolite mixtures and quartz; it is therefore younger. The opal has similar textural characteristics to the sepiolite, and therefore originated from the sepiolite by silicification. It is suggested that this sepiolite {{is the result of a}} chemical precipitation brought about by the reaction of hydrothermal solutions with sea water in fractures and voids. A pseudomorphic silicification then occurred on the sepiolite, and an opaline rock with the textural and structural features of the sepiolite was formed. The replacement of sepiolite by opaline minerals released Mg that produced a later formation of dolomite on the opaline chert and also on the biocalcarenites associated with the fractures. The ageing of the opaline minerals formed quartz in the inner parts of the dyke and vein...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThis {{research}} aims at integrating {{remote sensing}} data and field studies to prospect for radioactive materials at Gabal El Sela area, South Eastern Desert of Egypt. This {{area is a}} part of the Arabo-Nubian shield, which is constituted by Late Precambrian basement rocks and developed during the Pan African tectono-thermal event. Geological interpretation of Landsat ETM+ image and field studies revealed that the study area is mainly covered by ophiolitic ultramafic rocks, intermediate metavolocanics, granodiorites, biotite granites and garnetiferous muscovite granites. These rocks are injected by pegmatitic and quartz veins and cut by acidic and basic dykes. The processed Landsat ETM+ data enable also to identify uraniferous alteration zones hosted in the granitic rocks (using band ratio 5 / 7, 4 / 5, 3 / 1 in RGB, density slicing and supervised classification techniques). The measured reflectance values (DNs) of six spectral bands of Landsat ETM+ for all exposed rock types in the study area show that the alteration zones have the highest reflectance values. The study recorded the presence of uranium mineralizations in alteration zones associating with the granitic rocks occurring along ENE–WSW trending shear zones. Three uranium-bearing alteration zones hosted in granitic rocks were detected. These zones are characterized by <b>ferrugination,</b> silicification, grizenization and kaolinitization. The most promising alteration zones (Site 1) occurs at the northeastern part of Gabal El Sela and is characterized by very high radioactive anomalies (up to 5000 ppm eU). Microprobe analyses of samples collected from these alteration zones reveal the presence of uraninite crystals. It seems that the high fractures density of the granitic rocks acted as good channels for the ascending hydrothermal fluids and the percolating meteoric water, that leached the uranium minerals disseminated all over the rocks and redeposited them along the fractures of the shear zones. This study demonstrates the utility of orbital remote sensing data for finding unknown mineralized zones in the Eastern Desert of Egypt and similar arid regions...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVE: The goal of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the pathological changes associated with radiation treatment (stereotactic radiosurgery or conventional irradiation) of angiographically occult vascular malformations (AOVMs). METHODS: Eleven patients underwent surgical resection of an AOVM in the mesial temporal lobe, brain stem, thalamus, or basal ganglia after previous radiation treatment. The indications for surgery were recurrent symptomatic bleeding from the lesion in 10 patients and recurrent intractable seizures in 1 patient. Radiation was used as the initial therapy because the risk of surgical resection was deemed too high. Three patients received conventional radiation therapy of 3000 to 5400 rads at an outside institution. One patient received radiosurgery with the gamma knife at another institution using a dose of 15 Gy to the margin. The remaining 7 patients received stereotactic radiosurgery with a helium-ion particle beam. The dose range was from 18 to 26 Gy equivalents. The interval from radiation to surgical resection ranged from 1 to 10 years, with a mean of 3. 5 years. These lesions were compared with 10 nonirradiated cavernous malformations. RESULTS: One irradiated lesion was identified pathologically as a true arteriovenous malformation despite being angiographically occult. This lesion did not demonstrate significant changes in the vasculature but did have radiation necrosis of the surrounding brain 5 years after 25 Gy equivalents of helium-ion radiosurgery. Two other specimens were too small to identify the type of vascular malformation adequately. Of the remaining eight malformations identified as cavernous malformations, six showed a combination of marked fibrosis of the vascular channels, fibrinoid necrosis, and <b>ferrugination.</b> However, the fibrinoid necrosis was the only finding unique to the irradiated lesions compared with nonirradiated controls. All the irradiated lesions still had patent vascular channels; none were completely thrombosed. CONCLUSION: Radiosurgery or conventional radiation therapy did not cause histologic vascular obliteration in intracranial AOVMs evaluated 1 to 10 years (mean 3. 5 yr) after radiation delivery. It should be recognized that these patients are irradiation failures who may not be representative of all irradiated patients. However, recurrent bleeding from AOVMs may relate to poor radiation response in some patients...|$|E
