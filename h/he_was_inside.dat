5|$|Führer Schutzkommando ("Führer Protection Command"; FSK) was a {{protection}} unit founded by Himmler in March 1933. Originally charged with protecting the Führer only while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> {{the borders of}} Bavaria, its members consisted of police detectives of the Bavarian police and ministry. In the spring of 1934, they replaced the SS-Begleitkommando for Hitler's overall protection throughout Germany. The FSK was renamed the Reichssicherheitsdienst ("Reich Security Service"; RSD) in August 1935. Thereafter, the RSD and FBK worked together for security and protection during trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles. Johann Rattenhuber, chief of the RSD, was in overall command and the current FBK chief acted as his deputy.|$|E
5|$|Two other SS units {{composed}} the inner ring of Hitler's personal protection. The SS-Begleitkommando des Führers (Escort Command of the Führer), formed in February 1932, served as Hitler's protection escort {{while he was}} travelling. This unit consisted of eight men who served around the clock protecting Hitler in shifts. Later the SS-Begleitkommando was expanded and {{became known as the}} Führerbegleitkommando (Führer Escort Command; FBK). It continued under separate command and remained responsible for Hitler's personal protection. The Führer Schutzkommando (Führer Protection Command; FSK) was a protection unit founded by Himmler in March 1933. Originally it was charged with protecting Hitler only while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> the borders of Bavaria. In early 1934, they replaced the SS-Begleitkommando for Hitler's protection throughout Germany. The FSK was renamed the Reichssicherheitsdienst (Reich Security Service; RSD) in August 1935. Johann Rattenhuber, chief of the RSD, for the most part took his orders directly from Hitler. The current FBK chief acted as his deputy. Wherever Hitler was in residence, members of the RSD and FBK would be present. RSD men patrolled the grounds and FBK men provided close security protection inside. The RSD and FBK worked together for security and personal protection during Hitler's trips and public events, but they operated as two groups and used separate vehicles. By March 1938, both units wore the standard field grey uniform of the SS. The RSD uniform had the SD diamond on the lower left sleeve.|$|E

25|$|Gardner did {{not have}} many {{positive}} male role models as a child, as his father was living in Louisiana during his birth, and his stepfather was physically abusive to both {{his mother and his}} sisters. Triplett's fits of rage made both Gardner and his sisters constantly afraid. In one incident, Bettye Jean was falsely imprisoned when Triplett reported her to the authorities for welfare fraud; the children were placed in foster care. When Gardner was eight years old, he and his sisters returned to foster care for the second time when their mother, unbeknownst to them, was convicted of trying to kill Triplett by burning down the house while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside.</b>|$|E

After he recovers the beacon from the grave of Robert Bishop, John Mosley is taken down by Olivia. The beacon escapes into the earth, and The Observer reports that its departure was [...] "on schedule." [...] Peter confronts The Observer about the beacon, only to have a gibberish conversation that implies that the Observer knows what Peter is going to say before he says it, or, as Peter puts it, [...] "he knew me [...] <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> my head." [...] The Observer then knocks Peter out with an advanced sort of stun gun.|$|E

500|$|Nesbitt {{returned}} to theatre acting in June 2005 {{when he appeared}} in David Nicholls' After Sun, a ten-minute-play performed {{as part of the}} Old Vic's 24-Hour Play season. Nesbitt and Catherine Tate starred as a married couple who meet a pair of newlyweds returning from their honeymoon. Later that year, he appeared in his first full-length play in 11 years, in Owen McCafferty's Shoot the Crow. He enjoyed the stimulation of learning his lines and rehearsing with the cast and director. The play opened at the Trafalgar Studios in September 2005 and his role as Socrates gained mixed reviews. In The Independent, Michael Coveney suggested the role did not fit the actor: [...] "Nesbitt is cool. But I never felt that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> his role of a chap called Socrates [...] He grinned and shrugged through the evening which steadily became less about grouting on tiles and more about grating on nerves." [...] In The Daily Telegraph, Charles Spencer described Nesbitt's acting as [...] "outstanding".|$|E
500|$|Augustus {{was granted}} sole imperium {{within the city}} of Rome itself, in {{addition}} to being granted proconsular imperium maius and tribunician authority for life. Traditionally, proconsuls (Roman province governors) lost their proconsular [...] "imperium" [...] when they crossed the Pomerium – the sacred boundary of Rome – and entered the city. In these situations, Augustus would have power as part of his tribunician authority but his constitutional imperium within the Pomerium would be less than that of a serving consul. That would mean that, {{when he was in the}} city, he might not be the constitutional magistrate with the most authority. Thanks to his prestige or auctoritas, his wishes would usually be obeyed, but there might be some difficulty. To fill this power vacuum, the Senate voted that Augustus's imperium proconsulare maius (superior proconsular power) should not lapse when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> the city walls. All armed forces in the city had formerly been under the control of the urban praetors and consuls, but this situation now placed them under the sole authority of Augustus.|$|E
2500|$|Svatopluk {{also agreed}} to lead Carloman's armies against Slavomír and the rebellious Moravians. However, on his arrival at [...] "Rastislav's old city", Svatopluk betrayed the Bavarians and conspired {{secretly}} with the rebels. Although he captured the fortress in accordance with Carloman's plan, once <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> its walls he renounced his loyalty to Carloman, rallied a large Moravian force and launched a devastating surprise attack on the unsuspecting Bavarian army encamped outside. The Moravians took {{a great number of}} soldiers hostage, killed the rest and rid Moravia of the Frankish occupation. Carloman's governors, William and Engelschalk, were also both slain, and Svatopluk became the undisputed ruler of Great Moravia.|$|E

2500|$|In 1908, Houdini {{introduced}} his own original act, the Milk Can Escape. In this act, Houdini was handcuffed and sealed inside an oversized milk can {{filled with water}} and made his escape behind a curtain. As part of the effect, Houdini invited {{members of the audience}} to hold their breath along with him while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> the can. Advertised with dramatic posters that proclaimed [...] "Failure Means A Drowning Death", the escape proved to be a sensation. Houdini soon modified the escape to include the milk can being locked inside a wooden chest, being chained or padlocked. Houdini performed the milk can escape as a regular part of his act for only four years, but it has remained one of the acts most associated with him. Houdini's brother, Theodore Hardeen, continued to perform the milk can escape and its wooden chest variant into the 1940s.|$|E
2500|$|Joseph Hickman, Sergeant of the Guard on {{the night}} of the 2006 incident, was in charge of several posts manned by other soldiers. [...] Much of Hickman's account has been {{published}} in the 2010 Harper's Magazine article which contradicted the NCIS 2008 report. [...] In a 15 January 2015 interview on Democracy Now, Hickman replied to criticisms made by NCIS [...] that he could not have observed the activities surrounding the incident because he was a perimeter guard and not even working within the compound. [...] Hickman denies this assertion saying that while he was [...] "in the unique position I had where I was in the camp and outside the camp on certain duties", {{on the night}} of the alleged suicides <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> of the camp and able to view the activities going on outside of the Camp One building that housed the detainees and [...] 35 to 40 feet from the medical clinic as well.|$|E
2500|$|Coonan {{spoke to}} David Brown from Radio Times about the crash, {{where it was}} said that Carl would [...] "show just how evil he can be" [...] by causing it. Coonan said that Carl causes the crash because he wants to depose Phil as [...] "top boy" [...] in Albert Square, saying it is [...] "such an insane thing to do. You get to see how nuts Carl is. He doesn't care if Phil dies yet he risks {{damaging}} himself as well. [...] He realises he will {{have to get rid of}} him." [...] He also said that Phil is a [...] "major barrier" [...] for Carl getting what he wants, so he could either go into business with Phil or eliminate him. On filming the crash, Coonan explained that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>inside</b> the car when the glass was detonated, and he suffered cuts on his leg and hand. Brown said the crash looks [...] "visceral and intense" [...] on screen, and said that Phil is not scared of Carl because he sees him as a [...] "wannabe" [...] and a [...] "young pretender", but added that [...] "there is obviously more to [...] than [...] realises." ...|$|E
