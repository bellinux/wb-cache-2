50|$|The {{usefulness}} of the preoperative planning, no matter how accurate, depends on {{the accuracy of the}} reproduction of the simulated osteotomy in the surgical field. The transfer of the planning was mainly based on the surgeon's visual skills. Different guiding headframes were further developed to mechanically guide bone fragment repositioning. Such a headframe is attached to the patient's head, during CT or MRI, and surgery. There are certain difficulties in using this device. First, exact reproducibility of the headframe position on the patient's head is needed, both during CT or MRI registration, and during surgery. The headframe is relatively uncomfortable to wear, and very difficult or even impossible to use on small children, who can be uncooperative during medical procedures. For this reason headframes have been abandoned in favor of frameless stereotaxy of the mobilized segments with respect to the skull base.

40|$|International audienceIn {{this paper}} we propose an {{efficient}} method for denoising and extracting <b>fiducial</b> <b>point</b> (FP) of ECG signals. The method {{is based on a}} nonlinear dynamic model which uses Gaussian functions to model ECG waveforms. For estimating the model parameters, we use an extended Kalman filter (EKF). In this framework called EKF 25, all the parameters of Gaussian functions as well as the ECG waveforms (P-wave, QRS complex and T-wave) in the ECG dynamical model, are considered as state variables. In this paper, the dynamic time warping method is used to estimate the nonlinear ECG phase observation. We compare this new approach with linear phase observation models. Using linear and nonlinear EKF 25 for ECG denoising and nonlinear EKF 25 for <b>fiducial</b> <b>point</b> extraction and ECG interval analysis are the main contributions of this paper. Performance comparison with other EKF-based techniques shows that the proposed method results in higher output SNR with an average SNR improvement of 12 dB for an input SNR of- 8 dB. To evaluate the FP extraction performance, we compare the proposed method with a method based on partially collapsed Gibbs sampler and an established EKF-based method. The mean absolute error and the root mean square error of all FPs, across all databases are 14 msec and 22 msec, respectively, for our proposed method, with an advantage when using a nonlinear phase observation. These errors are significantly smaller than errors obtained with other methods. For ECG interval analysis, with an absolute mean error and a root mean square error of about 22 msec and 29 msec, the proposed method achieves better accuracy and smaller variability with respect to other methods.

In this paper, we propose a template matching technique of 12 features through <b>fiducial</b> <b>point</b> detection and logistic regression classifier that achieved high reliability and accuracy. Non-invasive ECG signals were captured using our custom-built ambulatory EEG/ECG embedded device (NeuroMonitor). ECG {{data were collected from}} healthy subjects (10), between 25 - 35 years, for 10 seconds per trial. The number of trials from each subject was 10. From each trial, only 0. 58 seconds of Lead I ECG data were used as template. Data were randomly separated into training and testing sets at a ratio of 80 : 20. Test data was used to find the classification accuracy. New hardware-efficient <b>fiducial</b> <b>point</b> detection for feature extraction was implemented. ECG template data with 12 extracted features provided the best performance in terms of accuracy (up to 100 %) and processing complexity (computation time of 1. 2 ms).

Up to last year, P- and T-wave annotations were only available for the QT DB. This was addressed by Elgendi et al. who provided P- and T-wave annotations to the MIT-BIH arrhythmia DB. A variety of ECG <b>fiducial</b> <b>points</b> detection algorithms exists in literature, whereas, to the best knowledge of the authors, we could not identify any single-lead algorithm ready for instantaneous P- and T-wave detection.
