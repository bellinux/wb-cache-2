40|$|Abstract â€” Mechatronic systems {{integrate}} mechanical, {{electrical and}} software subsystems. They are increasingly important in mission-critical infrastructures in different domains including automotive, healthcare, energy and transportation sectors. As such, the adequate testing and validation of such infrastructures are of prime importance. Mechatronic systems testing {{has been supported}} by different isolated industrial and research approaches including automated test infrastructures, model-based testing, and test execution engines. While these approaches have individual benefits, they are usually applied in isolation, suffering from different weaknesses. This paper reports on an integrated model-driven approach for mechatronic systems testing, where existing approaches are combined and enhanced. The result is unprecedented levels of automation and testability. We discuss the design and implementation of our approach, illustrating its use with a <b>hybrid</b> <b>calculator</b> example...|$|E

40|$|The {{applications}} of low-light imaging are widespread {{in areas such}} as biomedical imaging, remote sensing, ratiometric imaging, lithography, etc. The goal of this work is to develop a radiometrically scaled <b>hybrid</b> RCWT <b>calculator</b> to count the photons detected for such applications. The rigorous computation of different imaging models are discussed. An approach to calibrate the radiometry of the hybrid RCWT model for partially coherent illumination is presented. The diffraction from the object is evaluated rigorously using the hybrid RCWT model. A test bench is set up to validate the radiometrically scaled simulations. In all the cases considered, simulation and experiment agree within a 40 % difference...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{explores the}} question, How should this {{curriculum}} be revised {{in light of}} the Texas Instruments TI- 92, a hand-held <b>hybrid</b> of graphing <b>calculator</b> and computer? BACKGROUND The C PC project, now some 10 years old, is an ongoing curriculum-development and teacher-enhancement effort directed by Franklin Demana and Bert K. Waits. The teacher-enhancement component is based on intensive week-long summer inservice courses that have been attended by thousands of high school teachers at locations throughout the United States. These courses are now taught by a cadre of high school teachers {{as a part of the}} Teachers Teaching with Technology (T 3) program, headquartered at the University of Texas at Arlington. The curriculum-development component has led to a series of high school and college textbooks. The first regular edition of the high school text was Demana and Waits (1990). From the beginning, the curriculum has been designed to help students acquire the skills and understandings necessary for the successful study of calculus and science. The text materials focus on functions and graphs because students' lack of understanding of graphing and functions accounts for a major portion of their difficulties in calculus and because focusing students' attention on graphs and functions improves their readiness for calculu...|$|R
