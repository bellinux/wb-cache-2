25|$|It is {{important}} to observe that the huge body of work involving kinematics, dynamics and the mathematical models of the universe developed in baby steps – faltering, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> correcting itself – over three millennia and included contributions of both known names {{and others who have}} since faded from the annals of history.|$|E
25|$|Sprawling limbs require {{sideways}} flexing during locomotion (except for tortoises and turtles, {{which are}} very slow and whose armor keeps their bodies fairly rigid). However, despite Carrier's constraint, sprawling limbs are efficient for creatures that {{spend most of their}} time resting on their bellies and only move for a few seconds at a time—because this arrangement minimizes the energy costs of <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> lying down.|$|E
25|$|Erect limbs {{increase}} {{the costs of}} <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> lying down, but avoid Carrier's constraint. This indicates that dinosaurs were active animals because natural selection would have favored the retention of sprawling limbs if dinosaurs had been sluggish {{and spent most of}} their waking time resting. An active lifestyle requires a metabolism that quickly regenerates energy supplies and breaks down waste products which cause fatigue, i.e., it requires a fairly fast metabolism and a considerable degree of homeothermy.|$|E

25|$|It was {{the home}} of Collyer, a riverboat captain on the nearby Hudson, from 1899 until his death on September 22, 1942 as noted by New York Times. A few years after moving in, he cowrote The Sloops of the Hudson, a memoir {{and history of the}} years when sailboats were the primary means of <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the river. An {{exhaustive}} and complete work that drew on Collyer's background in a riverfaring family, it is today considered the definitive history of that era and its boats.|$|E
25|$|Meconium, or {{the first}} feces {{produced}} by the foal, is a hard pelleted substance. It is normally passed within the first 24 hours of the foal's life, but may become impacted in the distal colon or rectum. Meconium impaction is most commonly is seen in foals 1–5 days of age, and {{is more common in}} miniature foals and in colts more than fillies (possibly because fillies have a wider pelvis). Foals will stop suckling, strain to defecate (presents as an arched back and lifted tail), and may start showing overt signs of colic such as rolling and <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down. In later stages, the abdomen will distend as it continues to fill with gas and feces. Meconium impactions are often diagnosed by clinical signs, but digital examination to feel for impacted meconium, radiographs, and ultrasound may also be used.|$|E

Leconte said in an interview: [...] "If they had been Israeli bullets, they would be very strange bullets because they would have needed to go around the corner."

2500|$|Pollard {{was born}} in Trinidad and Tobago, where he was raised, along with two younger sisters, in a poor home by his single mother. Speaking about it, Pollard {{reflects}} [...] "It was pretty tough, it wasn't ideal <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> your mum say 'We only have X amount of money'." [...] After representing Trinidad and Tobago in the 2005 TCL Group West Indies Under-19 Challenge, he was selected {{as part of the}} West Indies Under-19 cricket team to tour Pakistan. Pollard top-scored for the West Indies in the first youth One Day International (ODI), scoring 53runs off 49balls. Pollard made another half-century in the second match, but didn't manage to make double figures in either of last two games. He was named in the West Indies squad for the 2006 U/19 Cricket World Cup, held in Sri Lanka, where he only managed to make 19–runs in his four innings, though he did manage to take two wickets in a defeat to Australia.|$|E

He was all over the place, winning tackles, making passes and <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> down the park and it was great to see." [...] On 16 March 2011, Ledley scored both Celtic goals in a 2–1 Scottish Cup win against Inverness Caledonian Thistle, taking Celtic into the last four. On 20 March 2011, Ledley played in the second cup final of his career, this time the Scottish League Cup Final against Rangers. [...] He scored with a glancing header in the first half to equalise an earlier goal from Rangers, but the Ibrox club eventually ran out 2–1 winners after extra time. A hamstring injury sustained in a league game against Rangers on 24 April 2011 ruled Ledley out of action for the rest of that season, with him missing out on Celtic's 3–0 win over Motherwell in the Scottish Cup Final. [...] The injury came at a frustrating time for Ledley as he had by then established himself as a key player in the Celtic midfield.|$|E

2500|$|Some {{time after}} <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> being {{attended}} to {{again by the}} aforementioned personnel, TV cameras showed a lingering shot of Foley smiling through his profusely bleeding mouth and lips, with a loose tooth hanging beneath his nose; the tooth having been knocked out due to being struck by the chair which had fallen through the cage and landed on his face, dislocating his jaw. Foley was actually trying to show {{a hole in his}} bottom lip by sticking his tongue through it, but it could not be seen clearly through his beard. The match continued for a while longer, ending with Foley receiving the Tombstone Piledriver after being slammed by The Undertaker onto hundreds of thumbtacks, which Foley himself had strewn onto the ring canvas. Although Foley lost, both wrestlers received a standing ovation for the match, and the event is often said to have jump-started Foley's main event career (Foley has said that although this match grew in legend, the reality was that his career remained [...] "somewhat sluggish" [...] for sometime afterwards until Foley further developed the Mankind character, and fans began to catch on). Many future matches attempted to replicate some of the spots from this match. In his autobiography Have a Nice Day! A Tale of Blood and Sweatsocks, Foley wrote that he could not remember much of what happened, and he had to watch a tape of the match to write about it. The match was voted Pro Wrestling Illustrateds Match of the Year for 1998. Although many fans regard the match as a classic, it has generated controversy as well. Critics charge that the falls in the match were so extreme and they set the bar for further bumps so high that the inevitable attempts to equal or surpass them would be very dangerous for any wrestlers involved.|$|E
