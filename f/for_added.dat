He struck out just 61 batters in 283 for a 1.6 K/9, and his ERA increased from 3.03in 1892to 4.41. Despite this, he helped Boston claim their third consecutive NL championship with a 20–12W–L record.|$|E
5|$|Myst IV: Revelation is {{the fourth}} {{installment}} in the Myst video game series, developed and published by Ubisoft. Revelation was the first game in the series released on a DVD-ROM format; a multiple CD-ROM version was not produced {{as it would have}} taken twelve compact discs to fit the data. Like , Revelation combines pre-rendered graphics with digital video, but also features real-time 3D effects <b>for</b> <b>added</b> realism.|$|E
5|$|The game's {{multiplayer}} mode pits {{two players}} {{against each other}} as they play as Mario and Luigi in one of five stages, trying {{to be the first to}} obtain a preset number of stars. Both players can attack each other in attempts to steal the other player's stars. Jumping on the opponent's character will make them lose one star, while performing a ground pound will lose them three. In addition, some minigames previously available in Super Mario 64 DS have returned and now offer multiplayer options <b>for</b> <b>added</b> replay value. The minigames are divided into the categories Action, Puzzle, Table and Variety. New Super Mario Bros. contains eighteen minigames for single players and ten minigames for multiple players.|$|E

5|$|Each {{heavy chain}} has two regions, the {{constant}} {{region and the}} variable region. The constant region is identical in all antibodies of the same isotype, but differs in antibodies of different isotypes. Heavy chains γ, α and δ have a constant region composed of three tandem (in a line) Ig domains, and a hinge region <b>for</b> <b>added</b> flexibility; heavy chains μ and ε have a constant region composed of four immunoglobulin domains. The variable region of the heavy chain differs in antibodies produced by different B cells, but {{is the same for}} all antibodies produced by a single B cell or B cell clone. The variable region of each heavy chain is approximately 110 amino acids long and is composed of a single Ig domain.|$|E
5|$|This {{record is}} {{a version of}} our now deleted and illegal LP '1987, What The Fuck Is Going On?' {{with all of the}} {{copyright}} infringing 'samples' edited out. As this leaves less than 25 minutes of music we are able to sell it as a 12-inch 45. If you follow the instructions below you will, after some practice, be able to simulate the sound of our original record. To do this you will need 3 wired-up record decks, a pile of selected discs, one t.v. set and a video machine loaded with a cassette of edited highlights of last weeks 'Top of the Pops'. Deck one is to play this record on, the other two are to scratch in the missing parts using the selected records. <b>For</b> <b>added</b> authentic effect you could use a Roland 808 drum machine (well cheap and what we used in the original recordings) to play along behind your scratching.|$|E
5|$|Turner {{and colleagues}} {{interpreted}} {{the presence of}} feathers on Velociraptor as evidence against {{the idea that the}} larger, flightless maniraptorans lost their feathers secondarily due to larger body size. Furthermore, they noted that quill knobs are almost never found in flightless bird species today, and that their presence in Velociraptor (presumed to have been flightless due to its relatively large size and short forelimbs) is evidence that the ancestors of dromaeosaurids could fly, making Velociraptor and other large members of this family secondarily flightless, though it is possible the large wing feathers inferred in the ancestors of Velociraptor had a purpose other than flight. The feathers of the flightless Velociraptor may have been used for display, for covering their nests while brooding, or <b>for</b> <b>added</b> speed and thrust when running up inclined slopes.|$|E

5|$|Each Surface overworld had a {{specific}} theme: the forest overworld revolved around landforms altering gameplay, the volcano overworld focused around {{changing the rules}} of gameplay, while the desert overworld was themed around duality between past and present. The first areas, the Sealed Grounds and Faron Woods, were created so players could be eased into the game's mechanics and navigation. While the forest areas were made to be mostly flat, the Eldin Volcano overworld was made with height differences in mind to provide a greater challenge. Elements in the volcano terrain included areas of lava, and slopes where Link's sprinting ability would become necessary for reaching new areas. For the Lanayru Desert, the team created three different overworld zones due to its unique time shifting mechanics, triggered with Time Shift stones: this shifting between different zones was inspired by similar systems in Ocarina of Time and Twilight Princess. The portable Time Shift stones were one of many ideas included in the desert overworld as they did not fit with the forest or volcano environments. A difficult feature to include naturally was the remnants of Lanayru's Ancient Civilization, which used electricity to power both its technology and citizens. Enemy types that recurred in all Surface-based overworld areas were given slightly altered designs so they would be unique to each overworld. The Silent Realms were created as a new mechanic, filled with enemies {{that could not be}} defeated and relying on Link's sprinting ability rather than his weapons or items. While they had experimented with indestructible enemies in Phantom Hourglass and Spirit Tracks, but this time it was changed by restricting Link's options and actions. They also created a time limit <b>for</b> <b>added</b> strategy, as knowledge of the areas where the Spirit Realms were located was key to completing them. This was also why they were set up in areas players would already be familiar with. They were originally in the form of special dungeons, but this was discarded in favor of the familiar areas.|$|E
