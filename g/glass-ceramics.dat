50|$|Fluorosilicate <b>glass-ceramics</b> {{have good}} {{mechanical}} properties. Potassium fluorrichterite based materials are composed from tiny interlocked rod-shaped amphibole crystals; {{they have good}} resistance to chemicals {{and can be used}} in microwave ovens. Richterite <b>glass-ceramics</b> are used for high-performance tableware.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Glass-ceramics</b> have an {{amorphous}} {{phase and}} one or more crystalline phases and are produced by a so-called [...] "controlled crystallization" [...] {{in contrast to a}} spontaneous crystallization, which is usually not wanted in glass manufacturing. <b>Glass-ceramics</b> have the fabrication advantage of glass, as well as special properties of ceramics. <b>Glass-ceramics</b> do not require brazing but can withstand brazing temperatures up to 700 °C. <b>Glass-ceramics</b> usually have between 30% m/m and 90% m/m crystallinity and yield an array of materials with interesting properties like zero porosity, high strength, toughness, translucency or opacity, pigmentation, opalescence, low or even negative thermal expansion, high temperature stability, fluorescence, machinability, ferromagnetism, resorbability or high chemical durability, biocompatibility, bioactivity, ion conductivity, superconductivity, isolation capabilities, low dielectric constant and loss, high resistivity and break-down voltage. These properties can be tailored by controlling the base-glass composition and by controlled heat treatment/crystallization of base glass. In manufacturing, <b>glass-ceramics</b> are valued for having the strength of ceramic but the hermetic sealing properties of glass.|$|E
50|$|Fluorosilicate <b>glass-ceramics</b> with sheet structure, {{derived from}} mica, are strong and machinable. They find {{a number of}} uses {{and can be used}} in high vacuum and as dielectrics and {{precision}} ceramic components. A number of mica and mica-fluoroapatite <b>glass-ceramics</b> were studied as biomaterials.|$|E
50|$|In the {{processing}} of <b>glass-ceramics,</b> molten glass is cooled down gradually before reheating and annealing. In this heat treatment the glass partly crystallizes. In many cases, so-called 'nucleation agents' are added in order to regulate and control the crystallization process. Because there is usually no pressing and sintering, <b>glass-ceramics</b> do not contain the volume fraction of porosity typically present in sintered ceramics.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass-ceramics</b> are {{polycrystalline}} {{ceramic materials}} {{prepared by the}} controlled crystallization of suitable glasses, normally silicates. Depending on the starting glass composition and the heat-treatment schedule adopted, <b>glass-ceramics</b> can be prepared with tailored thermal expansion characteristics. This makes them ideal for sealing {{to a variety of}} different metals, ranging from low expansion Tungsten (W) or Molybdenum (Mo) to high expansion stainless steels and nickel-based superalloys.|$|E
5000|$|Glass-ceramic {{materials}} {{share many}} properties with both glasses and ceramics. <b>Glass-ceramics</b> have an amorphous phase {{and one or}} more crystalline phases and are produced by a so-called [...] "controlled crystallization", which is typically avoided in glass manufacturing. <b>Glass-ceramics</b> often contain a crystalline phase which constitutes anywhere from 30% m/m to 90% m/m of its composition by volume, yielding an array of materials with interesting thermomechanical properties.|$|E
50|$|In {{the visible}} range <b>glass-ceramics</b> can be transparent, {{translucent}} or opaque and even colored by coloring agents.|$|E
50|$|Diopside based {{ceramics}} and <b>glass-ceramics</b> have potential applications in various technological areas. A diopside based glass-ceramic named 'silceram' {{was produced by}} scientists from Imperial College, UK during the 1980s from blast furnace slag and other waste products. The as produced glass-ceramic is a potential structural material. Similarly, diopside based {{ceramics and}} <b>glass-ceramics</b> have potential applications {{in the field of}} biomaterials, nuclear waste immobilization and sealing materials in solid oxide fuel cells.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass-ceramics</b> {{are mostly}} {{produced}} in two steps: First, a glass is formed by a glass-manufacturing process. The glass is cooled down and is then reheated {{in a second}} step. In this heat treatment the glass partly crystallizes. In most cases nucleation agents {{are added to the}} base composition of the glass-ceramic. These nucleation agents aid and control the crystallization process. Because there is usually no pressing and sintering, <b>glass-ceramics</b> have, unlike sintered ceramics, no pores.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Glass-ceramics</b> {{are made}} by heating glass to {{rearrange}} its atomic structure into a more regular pattern. As partially crystalline materials, they can tolerate high temperatures, thermal shock and chemicals. They are useful in many applications, such as heat-resistant cookware, turbine engines, electronic equipment, and missile nose cones. Other <b>glass-ceramics</b> are Pyroceram and ULE 7971(titanium silicate) developed by Corning Glass, and opaque white Hercuvit, closely related to Cer-Vit, developed for cooktops by Pittsburgh Plate Glass.|$|E
50|$|Some {{well-known}} {{brands of}} <b>glass-ceramics</b> are Pyroceram, Ceran (cooktops), Eurokera (cooktop, stoves and fireplaces), Zerodur (telescope mirrors), and Macor, Kanger (Glass-Ceramic for cooktop, stoves, microwave and fireplaces door). German manufacturer Schott introduced Zerodur in 1968, Ceran followed in 1971. Nippon Electric Glass of Japan is another worldwide manufacturer of glass ceramics, whose related products {{in this area}} include Firelite and Neoceram fire-rated glass. Keralite, manufactured by Vetrotech Saint-Gobain, is a specialty glass-ceramic fire and impact safety rated material for use in fire-rated applications. <b>Glass-ceramics</b> manufactured in the Soviet Union/Russia are known under the name Sitall.|$|E
50|$|The most {{interesting}} properties of these <b>glass-ceramics</b> are their thermomechanical properties. Glass-ceramic from the LAS {{system is a}} mechanically strong material and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 800-1000 °C. The dominant crystalline phase of the LAS <b>glass-ceramics,</b> HQ s.s., has a strong negative {{coefficient of thermal expansion}} (CTE), keatite-solid solution as still a negative CTE but much higher than HQ s.s. These negative CTEs of the crystalline phase contrasts with the positive CTE of the residual glass. Adjusting the proportion of these phases offers a wide range of possible CTEs in the finished composite. Mostly for today's applications a low or even zero CTE is desired. Also a negative CTE is possible, which means, in contrast to most materials when heated up, such a glass-ceramic contracts. At a certain point, generally between 60% m/m and 80% m/m crystallinity, the two coefficients balance such that the glass-ceramic as a whole has a thermal expansion coefficient that is very close to zero. Also, when an interface between material will be subject to thermal fatigue, <b>glass-ceramics</b> can be adjusted to match the coefficient of the material they will be bonded to.|$|E
50|$|Originally {{developed}} {{for use in}} the mirrors and mirror mounts of astronomical telescopes, LAS <b>glass-ceramics</b> have become known and entered the domestic market through its use in glass-ceramic cooktops, as well as cookware and bakeware or as high-performance reflectors for digital projectors.|$|E

50|$|Schott AG is an {{international}} manufacturing group of glass and <b>glass-ceramics.</b> The company is headquartered in Mainz, Germany and employs approximately 15,000 people worldwide.

50|$|Several {{glasses are}} {{utilized}} in transparent armor, such as normal plate glass (soda-lime-silica), borosilicate glasses, and fused silica. Plate glass {{has been the}} most common glass used due to its low cost, but greater requirements for the optical properties and ballistic performance have generated the need for new materials. Chemical or thermal treatments can increase the strength of glasses, and the controlled crystallization of certain glass systems can produce transparent <b>glass-ceramics.</b> Alstom Grid Research & Technology (Stafford, UK), produced a lithium disilicate based glass-ceramic known as TransArm, for use in transparent armor systems with continuous production yielding vehicle windscreen sized pieces (and larger). The inherent advantages of glasses and <b>glass-ceramics</b> include having lower cost than most other ceramic materials, the ability to be produced in curved shapes, and the ability to be formed into large sheets.|$|E
50|$|The {{chemical}} processing and synthesis of high performance technological components for the private, industrial and military sectors requires {{the use of}} high purity ceramics, polymers, <b>glass-ceramics</b> and material composites. In condensed bodies formed from fine powders, the irregular sizes and shapes of nanoparticles in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing density variations in the powder compact.|$|E
50|$|The {{ultimate}} microstructure (and {{thus the}} physical properties) {{of the final}} product will be limited by and subject to {{the form of the}} structural template or precursor which is created in the initial stages of chemical synthesis and physical forming. Hence the importance of chemical powder and polymer processing as it pertains to the synthesis of industrial ceramics, glasses and <b>glass-ceramics.</b>|$|E

5000|$|Full-porcelain dental {{materials}} include Dental porcelain (porcelain {{meaning a}} high-firing-temperature ceramic), other ceramics, sintered-glass materials, and <b>glass-ceramics</b> as indirect fillings and crowns or metal-free [...] "jacket crowns". They {{are also used}} as in-lays, on-lays, and aesthetic veneers. A veneer is a very thin shell of porcelain that can replace or cover part of the enamel of the tooth. Full-porcelain restorations are particularly desirable because their color and translucency mimic natural tooth enamel.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glass-ceramics</b> {{are used}} to make {{cookware}} (originally known by the brand name CorningWare) and stovetops which have both high resistance to thermal shock and extremely low permeability to liquids.

50|$|The {{chemical}} processing and synthesis of high-performance technological components for the private, industrial, and military sectors requires {{the use of}} high-purity ceramics (oxide ceramics, such as aluminium oxide or copper(II) oxide), polymers, <b>glass-ceramics,</b> and composite materials, as metal carbides (SiC), nitrides (Aluminum nitrides, Silicon nitride), metals (Al, Cu), non-metals (graphite, carbon nanotubes) and layered (Al + Aluminium carbonate, Cu + C). In condensed bodies formed from fine powders, the irregular particle sizes and shapes in a typical powder often lead to non-uniform packing morphologies that result in packing density variations in the powder compact.|$|E
50|$|Many {{materials}} become weaker at high temperatures. Materials which {{retain their}} strength at high temperatures, called refractory materials, {{are useful for}} many purposes. For example, <b>glass-ceramics</b> have become extremely useful for countertop cooking, as they exhibit excellent mechanical properties and can sustain repeated and quick temperature changes up to 1000 °C.In the aerospace industry, high performance materials used {{in the design of}} aircraft and/or spacecraft exteriors must have a high resistance to thermal shock. Thus, synthetic fibers spun out of organic polymers and polymer/ceramic/metal composite materials and fiber-reinforced polymers are now being designed with this purpose in mind.|$|E

5000|$|In 1961, General Electric {{began selling}} {{transparent}} alumina Lucalox bulbs. In 1966, GE announced a ceramic [...] "transparent as glass," [...] called Yttralox. In 2004, Anatoly Rosenflanz {{and colleagues at}} 3M used a [...] "flame-spray" [...] technique to alloy aluminium oxide (or alumina) with rare-earth metal oxides {{in order to produce}} high strength <b>glass-ceramics</b> with good optical properties. The method avoids many of the problems encountered in conventional glass forming and may be extensible to other oxides. This goal has been readily accomplished and amply demonstrated in laboratories and research facilities worldwide using the emerging chemical processing methods encompassed by the methods of sol-gel chemistry and nanotechnology.|$|E
5000|$|The {{several million}} tons of sand in the Salamayuca dunes can be {{considered}} as an enormous potential of silica sand since they are 90 to 95 pure silica (SiO2). Silica sand is widely used in what is called [...] "the transforamation industry", for the making of glass, silicates, paints, <b>glass-ceramics</b> and ceramics. [...] The sand of the Salamayuca dunes has attracted attention from the ceramic/glass industry but the desert sand contains sufficient impurities to pose problems with its use in industry, and a process to increase uniform purity to 97.5% SiO2 would have to be developed. [...] Because the sands start with such a high percentage of silica, such a process is deemed feasible.|$|E
50|$|Many materials, such as <b>glass-ceramics</b> {{and some}} polymers, can be {{prepared}} {{in such a way}} as to produce a mixture of crystalline and amorphous regions. In such cases, crystallinity is usually specified as a percentage of the volume of the material that is crystalline. Even within materials that are completely crystalline, however, the degree of structural perfection can vary. For instance, most metallic alloys are crystalline, but they usually comprise many independent crystalline regions (grains or crystallites) in various orientations separated by grain boundaries; furthermore, they contain other crystallographic defects (notably dislocations) that reduce the degree of structural perfection. The most highly perfect crystals are silicon boules produced for semiconductor electronics; these are large single crystals (so they have no grain boundaries), are nearly free of dislocations, and have precisely controlled concentrations of defect atoms.|$|E
50|$|One {{particularly}} notable use of <b>glass-ceramics</b> is in {{the processing}} of ceramic matrix composites. For many ceramic matrix composites typical sintering temperatures and times cannot be used, as the degradation and corrosion of the constituent fibres becomes more of an issue as temperature and sintering time increase. One {{example of this is}} SiC fibres, which can start to degrade via pyrolysis at temperatures above 1470K. One solution to this is to use the glassy form of the ceramic as the sintering feedstock rather than the ceramic, as unlike the ceramic the glass pellets have a softening point and will generally flow at much lower pressures and temperatures. This allows the use of less extreme processing parameters, making the production of many new technologically important fibre-matrix combinations by sintering possible.|$|E
5000|$|Avalon is also {{developing}} a lithium (petalite) deposit, located 70 km north of Kenora in Ontario, Canada. The Separation Rapids property is host {{to a large}} [...] "complex-type" [...] pegmatite; it is the fourth example {{in the world of}} a rare-metal pegmatite with the size required to be of major economic importance. The strike length of the deposit is over 1.5 km, and the width ranges from 10 to 70 metres. The mineralized zone is well exposed at surface in a low dome-shaped hill. This part of the deposit will be readily amenable to mining by low-cost quarrying methods. Avalon has demonstrated it is able to produce high-purity petalite from the deposit, for use in the <b>glass-ceramics</b> industry, as well as battery-grade lithium chemicals for use in the lithium-ion battery sector.|$|E
50|$|Several {{glasses are}} used in {{transparent}} armor, such as normal plate glass (soda-lime-silica), borosilicate glass, and fused silica. Plate glass {{has been the most}} common glass used due to its low cost. But greater requirements for the optical properties and ballistic performance have necessitated the development of new materials. Chemical or thermal treatments can increase the strength of glasses, and the controlled crystallization of certain glass compositions can produce optical quality <b>glass-ceramics.</b> Alstom Grid Ltd. currently produces a lithium di-silicate based glass-ceramic known as TransArm, for use in transparent armor systems. It has all the workability of an amorphous glass, but upon recrystallization it demonstrates properties similar to a crystalline ceramic. Vycor is 96% fused silica glass, which is crystal clear, lightweight and high strength. One advantage of these type of materials is that they can be produced in large sheets and other curved shapes.|$|E
50|$|In-situ {{aggregate}} formation: Many micro-composites {{form their}} aggregate particles {{by a process}} of self-assembly. For example, in high impact polystyrene, two immiscible phases of polymer (including brittle polystyrene and rubbery polybutadiene) are mixed together. Special molecules (graft copolymers) include separate portions which are soluble in each phase, and so are only stable at the interface between them, {{in the manner of}} a detergent. Since the number of this type of molecule determines the interfacial area, and since spheres naturally form to minimize surface tension, synthetic chemists can control the size of polybutadiene droplets in the molten mix, which harden to form rubbery aggregates in a hard matrix. Dispersion strengthening is a similar example from the field of metallurgy. In <b>glass-ceramics,</b> the aggregate is often chosen to have a negative coefficient of thermal expansion, and the proportion of aggregate to matrix adjusted so that the overall expansion is very near zero. Aggregate size can be reduced so that the material is transparent to infrared light.|$|E
5000|$|In 1884, {{the glass}} chemist Otto Schott partnered with the congenial Ernst Abbe, Carl Zeiss {{and his son}} Roderich Zeiss, founded the Glastechnisches Laboratorium Schott & Genossen, which would later become Jenaer Glaswerke Schott & Genossen and then Schott AG. Schott {{developed}} and manufactured optical glasses for microscopes, telescopes and binoculars. Around 1890 Schott developed borosilicate glasses featuring low thermal expansion coefficient and high chemical resistance very suitable for laboratory equipment later to be marketed under the DURAN brand to be sold in 2005. <b>Glass-ceramics</b> with even lower thermal expansion coefficient is marketed since 1968 as Zerodur for telescope mirrors and other technical applications and as Ceran for cooktops. Erich Schott, {{the son of the}} company founder, took over the management of the plant in 1927. The company suffered a severe blow at the end of World War II, when American troops brought its management and select experts over to West Germany. After the main production plant in Jena was expropriated, Erich Schott opened a new plant in Mainz, the company's current headquarters, in 1952. During Germany's division, there were two independent companies: the VEB Jenaer Glaswerk at the historic site, which would later be integrated into the combine VEB Carl Zeiss Jena, and the glassworks in Mainz that traded under the name Jenaer Glaswerk Schott & Gen. After the close cooperation of the two glassworks in the first years following World War II had been cancelled by the GDR in 1953, a dispute arose over the use of company names and its logo, a square with a circle and the words Jena Glass with a superscript [...] "er,". The two parties finally reached an agreement in 1981, which allowed the West German company to use the name [...] "Schott" [...] and the square with a circle, while the East German company was permitted to use the term [...] "Jenaer Glass." [...] After the fall of the inner German border in 1989, the company based in Mainz acquired the East German company in Jena.|$|E
