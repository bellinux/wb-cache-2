More than 1000 data of total coring length of more than 210 meters were used for statistical calculations. The data set includes <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity,</b> skewness, void ratio, water content, dry and water saturated bulk density, relative humidity, angle of friction, cohesion and compressive strength. Based on the data set the engineering geological description of sediments was reevaluated, and sand, clay, silt and bentonite-rich horizons were identified. Three new crosssections were prepared. Statistical analyses proved that there is an increase in cohesion and density of clays and silts with depth, indicating the role of consolidation...|$|E
40|$|Phenotypic {{plasticity}} {{is considered}} {{as an important}} mechanism for plants to cope with environmental challenges. Leaf growth {{is one of the}} first macroscopic processes to be impacted by modification of soil water availability. In this study, we intended to analyze and compare plasticity at different scales. We examined the differential effect of water regime (optimal, moderate water deprivation and recovery) on growth and on the expression of candidate genes in leaves of different growth stages. Candidates were selected to assess components of growth response: abscisic acid signaling, water transport, cell wall modification and stomatal development signaling network. At the tree scale, the four studied poplar hybrids responded similarly to water regime. Meanwhile, leaf growth response was under genotype[*]×[*]environment interaction. Patterns of candidate gene expression enriched our knowledge about their functionality in poplars. For most candidates, transcript levels were strongly structured according to leaf growth performance while response to water regime was clearly dependent on genotype. The use of an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> revealed that the magnitude of the response was higher for gene expression than for macroscopic traits. In addition, the ranking of poplar genotypes for macroscopic traits well paralleled the one for gene expression...|$|E
40|$|Two areas (a {{natural and}} an {{agricultural}} ecosystem), located on brown calcareous soil (correlated to Order Inceptisol, Subgroup Mollic Eutrudept in the Soil Taxonomy system), were chosen {{with the aim}} of assessing the effect of agricultural land use on soil quality using the compared scenarios perspective. The physical indicators analyzed were aggregate stabled, permeability coefficient, the factor of structure, lower and upper limits of plasticity, as well as, the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity.</b> The chemical indicators measured were pH (H 2 O), pH (KCl), organic matter content, and levels of P 2 O 5 and K 2 O. Soil microbiology was analyzed by plate counting. For mesofauna extraction was used the funnel methodology of Berlese-Tullgren. Data processing was done using STATGRAPHICS vs 5. 0 on Windows 7. The results demonstrated that the physical status of the soil was good in both ecosystems. Significant differences were found for pH, organic matter content, levels of P 2 O 5 and K 2 O, and in the microbial population. However, no differences were found in mesofauna components; but, the principal components analyses showed that the differentiation between both ecosystems is more defined by the mesofauna and microbiological indicators...|$|E

However, tests which simulate the behavior of the clay during processing and the mathematical modeling of some of its characteristics, particularly the plasticity, become difficult because many variables are involved and there is no consensus on the choice of method to be used. This study aimed to develop a mathematical model based on compression test to evaluate the <b>plasticity</b> <b>of</b> clays. Three types of clays were studied with different levels of moisture and their <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> were also characterized by the Atterberg’s and Pfefferkorn’s methods.

Thirty-two adult patients with various benign organic voice pathologies, and who had a (preoperative) functional voice therapy, were scored before therapy using a weighted multidimensional <b>Index</b> <b>of</b> Voice <b>Plasticity</b> (IVP). The hypothesis is that IVP could be a predictor of the final outcome of functional voice therapy, and therefore a correlation with a comparable quantification of the actual results of the therapy was investigated. The IVP shows a satisfactory correlation (Spearman's rho = 0. 68) with the efficacy of (preoperative) voice therapy. The IVP also significantly differs between diagnostic categories. Although its predictive value remains limited, the <b>Index</b> <b>of</b> Voice <b>Plasticity</b> seems helpful in decision making for indication of (presurgical) voice therapy...|$|R

However, building of roads in rural areas is always hindered by geographic limitation and often can be costly and energy inefficient. Hence it causes more adverse impact on the environment. Roadways designed for low-volume traffic are constructed of local soils containing high percentages of fines and high <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity.</b> These soils may not have characteristics appropriate for use in soil road construction, but can often be upgraded with soil stabilization technology to successfully recondition and strengthen existing road base and sub-base materials for extended life and heavier traffic duty.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was proposing gamma band {{activity}} (GBA) as an index of training-related brain plasticity in the motor cortex. Sixteen controls underwent an experimental session where electroencephalography (EEG) activity was recorded at baseline (resting) and during a motor task (hand movements). GBA was obtained from the EEG data at baseline and during the task. <b>Index</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> (IP) was defined as the relationship between GBA {{at the end of the}} motor task (GBAM_FIN), divided by GBA at the beginning of the task (GBAM_INI) for movements of both hands. There was a significant increase in GBA at the end of the task, compared to the initial GBA for the motor task (GBAM_FIN > GBAM_INI). No differences were found at baseline (GBAB_FIN ≈ GBAB_INI). Individual IP values had a positive (r = 0. 624) and significant correlation with subject's handedness. Due to plastic changes, GBA could indirectly but objectively reveal changes in cerebral activity related to physical training. This method could be used as a future diagnostic test in the follow-up of patients undergoing rehabilitation. It could also have potential applications in the fields of sports medicine...|$|E

An intermediate plasticity silty clayey soil with medium organic content was used in this study. This soft soil was treated with different percentages of a commercially available cement type 32. 5 -N. laboratory experiments were carried out on the soil treated with 0, 1. 5, 3, 6, 9, and 12 % OPC by the dry weight to determine {{the effect of}} OPC on the compaction parameters, consistency limits, and the compressive strength. Unconfined compressive strength test (UCS) was carried out on cement treated specimens after exposing them to different curing periods (1, 3, 7, 14, 28, and 90 days). The results of UCS test were used to develop a non-linear multiple regression model to find the relationship between the predicted and the measured maximum compressive strength of treated soil (qu). The results indicated that there were a significant improvement in the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> (IP) with treating by OPC; IP was decreased from 21 to 14. 1 by using 12 % of OPC; this percentage was enough to increase the unconfined compressive strength of the treated soil up to 1362 kPa after 90 days of curing. With respect to the statistical model of the predicted qu, the results showed that the regression coefficients (R 2) was equal to 0. 8534 which indicates a good reproducibility for the constructed model...|$|E
40|$|The {{basal ganglia}} is a brain region {{critically}} involved in reinforcement learning and motor control. Synaptic plasticity in the striatum of the basal ganglia is a cellular mechanism implicated in learning and neuronal information processing. Therefore, understanding how different spatio-temporal patterns of synaptic input select for {{different types of}} plasticity is key to understanding learning mechanisms. In striatal medium spiny projection neurons (MSPN), both long term potentiation (LTP) and long term depression (LTD) require an elevation in intracellular calcium concentration; however, it is unknown how the post-synaptic neuron discriminates between different patterns of calcium influx. Using computer modeling, we investigate the hypothesis that temporal pattern of stimulation can select for either endocannabinoid production (for LTD) or protein kinase C (PKC) activation (for LTP) in striatal MSPNs. We implement a stochastic model of the post-synaptic signaling pathways in a dendrite {{with one or more}} diffusionally coupled spines. The model is validated by comparison to experiments measuring endocannabinoid-dependent depolarization induced suppression of inhibition. Using the validated model, simulations demonstrate that theta burst stimulation, which produces LTP, increases the activation of PKC as compared to 20 Hz stimulation, which produces LTD. The model prediction that PKC activation is required for theta burst LTP is confirmed experimentally. Using the ratio of PKC to endocannabinoid production as an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> direction, model simulations demonstrate that LTP exhibits spine level spatial specificity, whereas LTD is more diffuse. These results suggest that spatio-temporal control of striatal information processing employs these Gq coupled pathways...|$|E
40|$|One {{postulated}} {{prerequisite for}} phenotypic plasticity to evolve {{in a population}} is gene flow among its members. To test this hypothesis, I compared the phenotypic <b>plasticity</b> <b>of</b> 3 congeneric nut-sedges (Cyperus: Cyperaceae) that are similar in size, cohabit sandy beaches, yet differ in their reproductive strategies. Cyperus strigosus reproduces sexually by seed, C. dentatus asexually by bulbils, tubers, and rhizomes, and C. esculentus {{by a combination of}} sexual seed and asexual rhizomes and tubers. I predicted that C. strigosus and C. esculentus would be most plastic due to their potential for gene migration, while the asexual C. dentatus would be less plastic. Progeny arrays from nine genotypes of each species were grown in a series of eight environments in growth chambers. I measured 15 vegetative and reproductive traits at maturity. Analysis of covariance indicated a plastic response to the environment for all traits as well as genetic variation in phenotypic plasticity for all but vegetative allocation traits. <b>Indices</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> for each genotype were highest for C. esculentus genotypes for vegetative traits and for C. strigosus genotypes for reproductive traits.

After acute and chronic exposure to 10 and 30 μg Cd/g dry food, as well as after recovery from both concentrations, the trait values, plasticity, variability and genetic correlations were evaluated. The ACPLys/ACPTot ratio decreased during acute and chronic effects of both concentrations.

40|$|INTRODUCTION: We {{examined}} {{the cumulative effect}} of 4 consecutive bouts of non-invasive brain stimulation on corticospinal plasticity and motor performance, and whether these responses were influenced by the brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF) polymorphism. METHODS: In a randomized double-blinded cross-over design, changes in strength and <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> corticospinal <b>plasticity</b> were analyzed in 14 adults who were exposed to 4 consecutive sessions of anodal and sham transcranial direct current stimulation (tDCS). Participants also undertook a blood sample for BDNF genotyping (N= 13). RESULTS: We observed a significant increase in isometric wrist flexor strength with transcranial magnetic stimulation revealing increased corticospinal excitability, decreased silent period duration, and increased cortical voluntary activation compared to sham tDCS.

40|$|In organisms {{with complex}} life cycles, {{environmentally}} induced plasticity across sequential stages can have important consequences on morphology and life history traits such as developmental and growth rates. However, previous research in amphibians and other ectothermic vertebrates {{suggests that some}} morphological traits are generally insensitive to environmental inductions. We conducted a literature survey to examine the allometric responses in relative hind leg length and head shape of post-metamorphic anuran amphibians to induced environmental (temperature, resource level, predation and desiccation risk) variation operating during the larval phase in 44 studies using 19 species. To estimate and compare plastic responses across studies, we employed both an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> and effect sizes from a meta-analysis. We found contrasting trait responses to different environmental cues. Higher temperatures increased development more than growth rate and induced smaller heads but not overall shifts in hind leg length. In contrast, an increment in resource availability increased growth more than development, with a parallel increase in hind leg length but no change in head shape. Increases in predation risk decreased both development and growth rates and slightly reduced relative hind leg length, {{but there was no}} change in head shape. Pond desiccation induced quick development and low growth rates, with no changes in morphology. Across environments, both hind leg and head shape plasticity were positively correlated with growth rate plasticity. However, plasticity of developmental rate was only correlated with head shape plasticity. Overall, these results suggest that environmental trends predicted by global warming projections, such as increasing pond temperature and accelerating pond desiccation, will significantly influence hind leg and head morphology in metamorphic frogs, which may affect performance and, ultimately, fitness. © Inter-Research 2010.

The fly ashes (FA 1 and FA 2) used in this study are by-products resulting from an incineration processes between 800 and 1200 ˚C. The stabilised soil in this study was an intermediate plasticity silty clayey soil with medium organic matter content. The experimental works were initially conducted on soil treated with different percentages of FA 1 (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 %) to identify the optimum FA 1 content. Then FA 1 was chemically activated by FA 2 which has high alkalinity by blending the optimum content of FA 1 with different portions of FA 2. The improvement levels were evaluated dependent on the results obtained from consistency limits and compaction tests along with the results of unconfined compressive strength (UCS) tests which were conducted on specimens of soil treated with FA 1 and FA 2 and exposed to different periods of curing (zero, 7, 14, and 28 days).

Using a reciprocal transplant experiment we tested the hypothesis of local adaptation in the aphid Brevicoryne brassicae. Aphid genotypes derived from two sympatric host plants, Brassica oleracea and B. campestris, were assessed in order to measure the extent of phenotypic plasticity in morphological and life history traits in relation to the host plants. We obtained an index of phenotypic plasticity for each genotype. Morphological variation of aphids was summarized by principal components analysis. Significant effects of recipient host on morphological variation and life history traits (establishment, age at first reproduction, number of nymphs, and intrinsic growth rate) were detected. We did not detected genotype × host plant interaction; in general the genotypes developed better on B. campestris, independent of the host plant species from which they were collected. Therefore, there was no evidence to suggest local adaptation. Regarding plasticity, significant differences among genotypes in the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> were detected. Furthermore, significant selection on PC 1 (general aphid body size) on B. campestris, and on PC 1 and PC 2 (body length relative to body size) on B. oleracea was detected. The elevation of the reaction norm of PC 1 and the slope of the reaction norm for PC 2 (i. e., plasticity) were under directional selection. Thus, host plant species constitute distinct selective environments for B. brassicae. Aphid genotypes expressed different phenotypes in response to the host plant with low or nil fitness costs. Phenotypic plasticity and gene flow limits natural selection for host specialization promoting the maintenance of genetic variation in host exploitation...|$|E

N 100 adaptation was reduced in CHR and psychosis, particularly among participants < 13 years old. Initial N 100 blunting partially accounted for differences.

40|$|This paper reviews music {{research}} using Mismatch Negativity (MMN). MMN is a deviation-specific component of auditory event-related potential (EPR), which detects a deviation between a sound and an internal representation (e. g., memory trace). Recent studies have expanded the notion and the paradigms of MMN to higher-order music processing {{such as those}} involving short melodies, harmony chord, and music syntax. In this vein, we firstly reviewed the evolution of MMN from sound to music and then mainly compared the differences of MMN features between musicians and nonmusicians, followed by {{the discussion of the}} potential roles of the training effect and the natural exposure in MMN. Since MMN can serve as an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> neural <b>plasticity,</b> it thus can be widely used in clinical and other applied areas, such as detecting music preference in newborns or assessing wholeness of central auditory system of hearing illness. Finally, we pointed out some open questions and further directions. Current music perception research using MMN has mainly focused on relatively low hierarchical structure of music perception. To fully understand the neural substrates underlying processing of regularities in music, it is important and beneficial to combine MMN with other experimental paradigms such as early right-anterior negativity (ERAN) ...|$|R

In the field of soil stabilisation, waste materials such as pulverised fuel ash (PFA), biomass fly ash (BFA), sewage sludge ash (SSA), etc.; have been used since the 1960 s. In this study, {{a particular type of}} a waste material (WM) was used in soft soil stabilisation as a cement replacement combined with the effect of mechanical activation, using grinding, to enhance the performance. The stabilised soil in this study was an intermediate plasticity silty clayey soil with medium organic matter content. The experimental investigations were conducted to find the optimum content of WM by determining the Atterberg limits and the unconfined compressive strength (UCS) of soil samples containing (0, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 %) of WM by the dry weight of soil. The UCS test was carried out on specimens exposed to different curing periods (zero, 7, 14, and 28 days). Moreover, the optimum percentage of the WM was subject to different periods of grinding (10, 20, 30, 40 mins) using a mortar and pestle grinder to determine the effect of grinding and its optimum time by conducting UCS tests.

40|$|Civil {{engineering}} projects {{located in}} areas with soft soil present {{some of the most}} common problems {{in many parts of the}} world. Depending on the nature of the project, expensive solutions are sometimes used, which commonly involves the removal and replacement of the weak soils. Alternatively, ground improvement is now considered the best solution for such problems. Soil improvement can be achieved either by mechanical and/or chemical stabilisation. To reduce the use of cement and lime as the most traditional stabilizers applied to soft soils, sustainable waste materials have been increasingly used for soil stabilisation. This paper presents the results of a laboratory study on the stabilisation of silty clayey soil using a waste material fly ash (FA) with high calcium content produced from the incineration processes in domestic power stations. The FA used in this study has a high content of calcium oxide CaO and suitable content of silicon dioxide SiO 2 (more than 25 %). These cementitious and pozzolanic properties are responsible for the self-cementing characteristics of this fly ash. An intermediate plasticity silty clayey soil with medium organic matter content has been used in this study. The effect of FA on the physical and engineering properties on the selected soil such as the consistency limits, compaction characteristics (optimum moisture content and maximum dry density), and soil strength (unconfined compressive strength (UCS)), has been investigated. Different percentages of fly ash were added to the soft soil (1. 5, 3, 6, 9, 12, and 15 %) to produce different admixtures. Improvement levels were evaluated dependant on the UCS tests carried out on specimens at different periods of curing (zero, 7, 14, and 28 days). Results indicated that the maximum dry density decreased and the optimum moisture content increased with the increase of the FA content. In terms of the UCS tests, the results yielded the optimum value of the FA used in this study to be 12. 0 %, as this percentage decreased the <b>index</b> <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> (IP) significantly.

The WM {{used in this study}} is produced from the incineration processes in domestic energy power plant and it is available in two different grades of fineness (coarse waste material (CWM) and fine waste material (FWM)). An intermediate plasticity silty clayey soil with medium organic matter content has been used in this study. The suitability of the CWM and FWM to improve the physical and engineering properties of the selected soil was evaluated dependant on the results obtained from the consistency limits, compaction characteristics (optimum moisture content (OMC) and maximum dry density (MDD)); along with the unconfined compressive strength test (UCS). Different percentages of CWM were added to the soft soil (3, 6, 9, 12 and 15 %) to produce various admixtures. Then the UCS test was carried out on specimens under different curing periods (zero, 7, 14, and 28 days) to find the optimum percentage of CWM. The optimum and other two percentages (either side of the optimum content) were used for FWM to evaluate the effect of the fineness of the WM on UCS of the stabilised soil.

40|$|Long-term {{potentiation}} (LTP) is a {{key element}} <b>of</b> synaptic <b>plasticity.</b> At the macroscopic level, similar effects can be induced in the human brain using repetitive stimulation with identical stimuli. High-frequency stimulation (HFS) can increase neuronal responses whereas low-frequency stimulation may produce the opposite effect. Optimal stimulation frequencies and characteristics for inducing stimulus-specific response modification differ substantially from those applied to brain tissue slices but have been explored in recent studies. In contrast, the individual manifestation of this effect in terms of its spatial location and extent are unclear. Using functional MRI (fMRI) in 18 subjects (mean age 25. 3 years), we attempted to induce LTP-like effects by HFS with checkerboard flashes at 9 Hz for 120 seconds. As expected, flashes induced strong activation in primary and secondary visual cortices. Contrary to our expectations, we found clusters of decreased activations induced by pattern flashes after HFS at the border between primary and secondary visual cortices [...] On the level of the individual subject, some showed significantly increased activations in the post-HFS session while the majority showed significant decreases. The locations of areas showing altered activations before and after HFS were only partly overlapping. No association between location, extent and direction of the HFS-effect was observed. The findings are unexpected in the light of existing HFS-studies, but mirror the high inter-subject variability, concerning even the directionality of the induced effects shown for other <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> LTP-like <b>plasticity</b> in the human brain. As this variability is not observed in LTP at the cellular level, a better understanding of LTP-like mechanisms on the macroscopic level is essential for establishing tools to quantify individual synaptic plasticity in-vivo...|$|R
40|$|Millions of {{children}} are exposed to low levels of environmental neurotoxicants as their brains are developing. Conventional laboratory methods of neurotoxicology can detect maldevelopment of brain structure but are not designed to detect maldevelopment of the brain’s capacity for plasticity that could impair learning throughout life. The environmental complexity (EC) paradigm has become classic for demonstrating the modifications in brain structure that occur in response to experience and thus provides a set <b>of</b> <b>indices</b> for <b>plasticity</b> in the healthy brain. In this study, we have tested the hypothesis that if degradation <b>of</b> experience-dependent cortical <b>plasticity</b> {{is used as a}} biomarker, then developmental neurotoxic effects will be detected at doses below those that alter cortical morphogenesis overtly. Pregnant Long-Evans hooded rats received a single injection of either saline vehicle or 1, 5, 10, or 25 mg/kg of the well-characterized developmental neurotoxicant methylazoxymethanol acetate (MAM) on the 16 th or 17 th day of gestation. On postnatal days 35 – 39, male offspring were assigned to either a complex environment (EC) or an individual cage (IC) for 28 days to stimulate neuroanatomical plasticity. This response was measured as the difference between the thickness of visual cortex of IC and EC littermates at a given dose. The threshold dose for significant reduction of cortical thickness was 25 mg/kg, but the threshold dose for failure <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> was much lower and could be detected at 1 mg/kg, the lowest dose used. No other method of assessment has detected lasting effects of prenatal exposure to MAM at such a low dose. These data suggest that this simple test <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> could be an efficient way to detect subtle neurotoxic damage to th...|$|R
40|$|International audienceCircadian rhythms in mammals are {{synchronized}} to {{the light}} (L) /dark (D) cycle through messages relaying in the master clock, the suprachiasmatic nucleus of the hypothalamus (SCN). Here, we provide evidence that the SCN undergoes rhythmic ultrastructural rearrangements over the 24 -h cycle characterized by day/night changes of the glial, axon terminal, and/or somato-dendritic coverage of neurons expressing arginine vasopressin (AVP) or vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), the two main sources of SCN efferents. At nighttime, we noted {{an increase in the}} glial coverage of the dendrites of the VIP neurons (+ 29 %) that was concomitant with a decrease in the mean coverage of the somata (- 36 %) and dendrites (- 43 %) of these neurons by axon terminals. Conversely, glial coverage of the dendrites of AVP neurons decreased (- 19 %) with parallel increase in the extent of somatal (+ 96 %) and dendritic (+ 52 %) membrane appositions involving these neurons. These plastic events were concomitant with daily fluctuations in quantitative expression of glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP), which were then used as an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> structural <b>plasticity.</b> The GFAP rhythm appeared to be strictly dependent on light entrainment, indicating that structural reorganization of the SCN may subserve synchronization of the clock to the L/D cycle. Other results presented reinforced this view while showing that circulating glucocorticoid hormones, which are known to modulate photic entrainment, were required to maintain amplitude of the GFAP rhythm to normal values...|$|R

30|$|In {{addition}} to being characterized by both gains and losses, adult development {{is characterized by a}} considerable degree <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> (e.g., Baltes 1987; Lerner 1984). That is, development is neither completely fixed (predetermined), nor is it completely open. Plasticity refers to the range (and limits) of development and is an <b>index</b> <b>of</b> an individual’s change potential, including how flexible and robust he or she might be in dealing with challenges and demands (resilience). Plasticity is not synonymous with development (i.e., change over time), but rather refers to the degree to which individuals (could potentially) diverge from usually observed developmental trajectories or their own usual level of performance. We are particularly interested in identifying the conditions—particularly in the work context—under which the upper potentials <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> are reached.|$|R

40|$|When {{the optimal}} {{phenotype}} differs among environments, adaptive phenotypic plasticity can evolve unless constraints impede such evolution. Costs and limits <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> {{have been proposed}} as important constraints on the evolution <b>of</b> <b>plasticity,</b> yet confusion exists over their distinction. We attempt to clarify these concepts by reviewing their categorization and measurement, highlighting how costs and limits are defined in different currencies (and may describe the same phenomenon). Conclusions from studies that measure the costs <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> have been equivocal, but we caution that these conclusions may be premature owing to a potentially common correlation between environment-specific trait values and the magnitude <b>of</b> trait <b>plasticities</b> (i. e. multi-collinearity) that results in imprecise and/or biased estimates of the costs.

40|$|The article gives {{analysis}} of practical value of soybean varieties according to productivity and ecological plasticity in different climatic provinces of Ukraine. Ecological estimation of soybean varieties by {{the methodology of}} Eberhart and Rassel has been made. This estimation helped to determine variety plasticity and potential to adaptability. It has been established that varieties Almaz and Diona were the best according {{to the results of}} ecological research of varieties. The most favourable regions for cultivation of up-to-date soybean varieties have been chosen. Variety Almaz has been defined as the most intensive and plastic soybean variety (average yield during research years was 2. 66 – 2. 93  t/hа). Varieties Antratsit and Ametist also have shown high plasticity. The article gives rank estimation of practical value of soybean varieties on the basis of grain productivity. It has been established that all examined varieties had high economic value – coefficient of agronomic stability is higher than 70 %. Variety Almaz has the greatest selective value according to homeostatic character. Almaz is the most intensive variety with maximal plasticity grown in Poltava region. Varieties with high <b>indices</b> <b>of</b> adaptability and <b>plasticity</b> which are very valuable for selection and practical use have been singled out...|$|R
40|$|Organisms {{are capable}} of an {{astonishing}} repertoire of phenotypic responses to the environment, and these often define important adaptive solutions to heterogeneous and unpredictable conditions. The terms 'phenotypic plasticity' and 'canalization' indicate whether environmental variation has a large or small effect on the phenotype. The evolution <b>of</b> canalization and <b>plasticity</b> is influenced by optimizing selection-targeting traits within environments, but inherent fitness costs <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> may also be important. We present a meta-analysis of 27 studies (of 16 species of plant and 7 animals) that have measured selection on the degree <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> independent <b>of</b> the characters expressed within environments. Costs <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> and canalization were equally frequent and usually mild; large costs were observed only in studies with low sample size. We tested the importance of several covariates, but only the degree of environmental stress was marginally positively related to the cost <b>of</b> <b>plasticity.</b> These findings suggest that costs <b>of</b> <b>plasticity</b> are often weak, and may influence phenotypic evolution only under stressful conditions...|$|R
