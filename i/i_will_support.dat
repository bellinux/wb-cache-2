500|$|Although ex-Confederates were {{generally}} a safe voting bloc for Democrats, Goebel could not heavily rely on {{them because of}} his father's ties to the Union. Also, in 1895, Goebel had killed John Sanford, an ex-Confederate, in a duel stemming from a personal dispute between the two men. This made him particularly odious to Brown supporter Theodore Hallum, a friend of Sanford's, who said of Goebel at a campaign rally in Bowling Green [...] "hen the Democratic Party of Kentucky, in convention assembled, sees fit in its wisdom to nominate a yellow dog for the governorship of this great state, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> <b>support</b> him — but lower than that you shall not drag me." [...] Goebel tried to mitigate his lukewarm support from ex-Confederates by courting the black vote, long given to the Republicans, though {{he had to do}} so carefully to avoid further alienating his own party base. Unlike other Democrats, Goebel had not voted on the Separate Coach Bill, a law that required blacks and whites to use segregated railroad facilities. Most blacks opposed the bill, and Goebel tried to remain silent on the issue, but when pressed, he admitted in a campaign event in Cloverport that he supported the bill and would oppose its repeal. Likewise, Taylor had tried to dodge the issue of the Separate Coach Bill to avoid upsetting the [...] "lily white" [...] branch of his party, but a week after Goebel took a position in favor of the bill, Taylor came out against it. This marked {{a turning point in the}} campaign, as blacks, at first cool toward Taylor, now actively supported him.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{analyses}} Paul Valéry’s theories {{relating to}} his stated goal of poetic production: {{the attainment of}} “resonance” and a “singing-state”. My intention is to defend Valéry’s theory as a valid and consistent model of the creative process in poetry. To that end, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> draw <b>support</b> from T. W. Adorno’s claim that Valéry’s manner of reflective journalising in his Notebooks can furnish us with what he calls “aesthetic insight”. The consistency of Valéry’s theory <b>will</b> be <b>supported</b> by comparisons with the inferentialist understanding of semantics.

40|$|In this thesis, I shall {{discuss the}} {{importance}} of <b>supporting</b> caregivers. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> focus primarily on the introduction and description of problematic phenomena related to caring, to the caregiver's role, then of delivering care and its species.

At thesis I try to highlight the care provided by amateurish carers about {{the importance of}} their support and also to outline the positive aspects of care. Family carers deserve admiration. Their strength and conviction in many cases is unimaginable. Caregivers must overcome many obstacles and still manage most of the care...|$|R

40|$|Human cloning until {{recently}} {{has been considered}} {{to belong to the}} domain of science fiction; now it is a tangible possibility, a hopeful as well as a fearsome one. One of the fears that necessarily come along with it is about the peril cloning might represent for human uniqueness, since the clones are expected to be identical to their prototypes; this would unavoidably compromise moral agents’ right to a unique identity. In this paper <b>I</b> <b>will</b> put under examination the argument against cloning that is based upon the right to a unique identity; <b>I</b> <b>will</b> argue that cloning represents no actual threat for anybody’s unique identity, therefore this argument is futile. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> also <b>support</b> the view that the so-called right to a unique identity is not as indisputable as to serve as the basis of a moral argument against human reproductive cloning...|$|R

40|$|This {{project will}} be an {{examination}} of the concept of community as it relates to ethics in the works of Martin Heidegger and Jean-Luc Nancy. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> examine Heidegger's thought concerning community and ethics, then the reception of that thought in the secondary literature. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> then examine Nancy's thought concerning community and ethics and his thought's reception in the secondary literature. The critical portion of this {{project will be}} an evaluation of Nancy's critical relationship with Heidegger's thought. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> clarify and defend Nancy's arguments against Heidegger's thought. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> also <b>support</b> solution that Nancy proposes. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>will</b> attempt to resolve a criticism commonly launched against Nancy: that his thought fails to engage concrete politics precisely where is must. <b>I</b> <b>will</b> argue that Nancy's thought does indeed engage the concrete by encouraging the development of a praxis, comportment or lifestyle amongst its recipients. Nancy's thought engages us in a dialogue. This dialogue is something which can, and does, continue outside of our relationship with the texts we read, potentially affecting the way we relate to others in our everyday lives...|$|R
