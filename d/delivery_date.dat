5|$|A post-war {{review by}} the Australian government's Defence Committee {{recommended}} that the RAN be restructured around a task force incorporating multiple aircraft carriers. Initial plans were for three carriers, with two active and a third in reserve at any given time, although funding cuts led to the purchase of only two carriers in June 1947; Terrible and sister ship Majestic, for the combined cost of AU£2.75 million, plus stores, fuel, and ammunition. As Terrible was fitted out as a flagship and was the closer of the two ships to completion, construction was finished without major modification. Although Terrible was due for completion on 24 June 1948, a skilled labour shortage affected {{the installation of the}} ship's boilers, causing the Admiralty to revise the <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> to October 1948.|$|E
5|$|Nine shelters {{throughout}} the Northern Mariana Islands were opened to accommodate families needing assistance. Several schools opened classrooms as evacuation centers. On Guam, ten schools {{were used as}} shelters, and {{on the day of}} impact 2,271people were in shelters. On Rota, 159people sought shelter, and in Saipan, 549 were in shelters by the day of impact. The Guam Memorial Hospital officials advised all pregnant women within 32weeks of their <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> to check in. The Guam Office of Civil Defense filed the paperwork for the Federal Emergency Management Agency to declare the island a disaster area. Governor Carl T.C. Gutierrez took similar measures to declare a state of emergency for the area. Following experience from previous typhoons, Guam newspaper Pacific Daily News underwent preparations to provide internet updates for the storm, including reinforcing the building, maintaining sufficient food supplies for the staff, and stationing two reporters elsewhere on the island; the paper was the only immediate source of information about the typhoon outside of Guam.|$|E
5|$|Several {{sets were}} {{rendered}} digitally, {{and almost all}} of the sets had some form of digital enhancement. The largest digital environment was the Devetashka cave, which had to be digitally recreated because of the environmental concerns of filming explosions in the real cave. Using over 5,000 photographs taken at different times of day, the cave was accurately illuminated and rendered down to crevices and moss. The cave's interior containing a concealed nuclear vault was subjected to several changes up to two months before the effects' <b>delivery</b> <b>date</b> based on editorial input, including modifications to its scale. The railcar used within the cave was also digitally built alongside a practical version, but the digital versions versatility saw it largely replace its practical counterpart. The scene featuring the Expendables and prisoners trapped in the cave were shot entirely on Chroma key with the cave background inserted later.|$|E

40|$|Part IV: ICT and Emerging TechnologiesInternational audienceToday a high {{adherence}} to <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> {{is the main}} logistic target for manufacturing companies. To control the increasing complexity of production planning and control manufacturing companies use IT systems. However, the applied IT systems often do not provide a reliable forecast of <b>delivery</b> <b>dates</b> and thus affect the required {{adherence to}} <b>delivery</b> <b>dates.</b> The paper describes a cyber-physical approach to optimize the production planning and control towards a reliable detailed planning. Therefore, {{it is necessary to}} determine the deviations between the production schedule of the IT system and the production processes in reality. With the knowledge of the revealed deviations and their causes the process of production planning can be adjusted towards a more dependable high resolution production planning and control...|$|R
