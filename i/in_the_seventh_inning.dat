5|$|The {{game was}} only {{available}} {{on television in}} the Chicago and Seattle markets, because a game between the New York Yankees and the Boston Red Sox at Fenway Park, also on the network, was broadcast by more affiliates. Games between those two rivals generate {{a great deal of}} interest and receive extensive media coverage, including being broadcast on national television. Fox did, however, cut away from Yankees–Red Sox game, which was already <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning,</b> to show the final three outs of Humber's perfect game, even in the Boston and New York markets.|$|E
5|$|In {{the sixth}} inning, the Yankees cut the Cardinals' lead. With two outs, Joe Dugan hit a single. Hank Severeid {{followed}} with a double, scoring Dugan, before pinch-hitter Ben Paschal grounded to Haines to end the inning. Game1 and 5 winner Herb Pennock came in relief for Hoyt <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning.</b> He yielded only one hit in the inning and limited the Cardinals to their 3–2 lead. In {{the bottom half of}} the inning, the Yankees loaded up the bases with Earle Combs, Ruth and Lou Gehrig. At this point, there were two outs, and Haines had developed a blister on his pitching hand, and could no longer pitch in the game.|$|E
5|$|On April 15, 2012, Red Sox manager Bobby Valentine {{publicly}} questioned Youkilis' {{motivation and}} physical ability to succeed. Viewing rookie Will Middlebrooks as the superior third baseman, Valentine {{began to play}} Middlebrooks over Youkilis. The Red Sox traded Youkilis to the Chicago White Sox on June 24 for pitcher Zach Stewart and utility man Brent Lillibridge. The Red Sox agreed to pay $5.5 million of Youkilis' salary to help close the deal. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning</b> of that day's game, Ben Cherington, the Red Sox General Manager, informed Valentine that a transaction was pending. Youkilis hit a triple in his last at bat, and received a long standing ovation while tipping his helmet to the crowd after being taken out for pinch runner Nick Punto.|$|E

5|$|Coveleski's {{status as}} the ace of the staff was {{demonstrated}} when he was named the starter for Opening Day of the 1917 season; he beat the Detroit Tigers 6–4 on April 11. He improved statistically during the 1917 season, winning 19 games and losing 14 with an ERA of 1.81 and a career high 133 strikeouts. On September 19, Coveleski pitched a one-hitter against the New York Yankees; the only hit came from Fritz Maisel <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning.</b> Coveleski continued to improve during the war-shortened 1918 season. His outings that year included pitching a complete game against the New York Yankees, where he pitched 19 innings, allowing two runs as the Indians won, 3–2. He finished {{the season with a}} 22–13 record, a 1.82 ERA, and 311innings pitched in 38 games, 33 of them starts; his wins and ERA were both second in the American League to Walter Johnson. In 1919, Coveleski pitched in 43 games, starting 34, and had a 24–12 record and an ERA of 2.61.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning,</b> the Yankees faced a new pitcher, {{this time}} southpaw Bill Hallahan, {{who served as}} both a starter and {{reliever}} for the Cardinals. After Severeid singled and subsequently advanced on a sacrifice bunt by Hoyt, he scored on a double hit into left field by Combs. The Yankees led 10–4 and did not get any more runs or hits in the eighth or ninth inning. The Cardinals came up to bat {{in the bottom of}} the ninth inning with Hoyt trying to hold on to his six-run lead. Hornsby singled to right field and advanced to second base on the following play. He then ran home to score a run on a Les Bell single to center field. Hafey then popped up in foul territory, and Severeid made the catch. The game ended with a 10–5 score. Waite Hoyt pitched a complete game, allowing two earned runs on 14 hits while striking out eight batters. The Cardinals' five pitchers combined to give up 10 Yankee runs and 14 hits. With the series tied at two games apiece, both teams anticipated Game5, which featured a rematch between Herb Pennock and Bill Sherdel.|$|E
5|$|The 2009 season {{seemed to}} mark a rebound in Zito's {{pitching}} performance. Though starting the season 0–2 with an ERA of 10, Zito ended {{the season with}} an ERA of 4.03. His ERA would have been 3.74 {{had it not been}} for his first two starts. Though going only 10–13 in the season, Zito's record was much more the fault of his spotty run support (the second-lowest in the major leagues) than his performance on the mound. On June 21, Zito pitched a no-hitter through six innings against Texas before giving up a home run to Andruw Jones <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning.</b> He won the game, his fourth win of the season. On July 7, Zito pitched what could be considered his best game of the season. He pitched 8⅓ innings against the Florida Marlins, allowing one run on four hits, striking out six, and walking one. He won the game, his fifth win of the season.|$|E

5|$|The rest of {{the fifth}} inning saw no more hits, and after a Keltner double, three Indians {{were out in the}} top of the sixth inning. The Red Sox began to fight back in the bottom of the sixth inning. After getting Pesky out, Ted Williams reached first base on an error by Gordon. Stephens struck out, and with two outs in the inning, Bobby Doerr hit his 27th home run of the season to make the score 6–3. No runs were scored <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning,</b> though Bearden and Mitchell both reached base. The Indians were able to score another run in the eighth inning after Jim Hegan was {{intentionally}} walked. Bearden then hit a fly ball to Williams, who dropped it, allowing Hegan to score and making it 7–3 in the Indians' favor. The Indians were able to score one more run in the ninth when Robinson scored after Keltner grounded into a bases-loaded double play. Bearden got the final three Red Sox out in the bottom of the ninth, finishing the game with an 8–3 Indians victory and giving Bearden a complete game.|$|E
5|$|There were no hits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning,</b> as both {{pitchers}} retired {{the first}} three batters they faced. In {{the top of the}} eighth inning, Irvin hit the third home run of the game, his 24th of the year, to make the score 3–1. Lockman then reached first base on an error and was able to advance to third base, but Mays and Hearn both struck out to keep the score intact. No Dodgers managed a hit {{in the bottom of the}} eighth, though the Dodgers brought in Jim Russell to use as a pinch hitter for Branca. In the ninth inning, Alvin Dark doubled for the Giants, but he was the only player on either team to earn a hit; Hearn retired all three Dodgers hitters to end the game with the 3–1 victory, earning a complete game win after allowing five hits to the Dodgers. Those in attendance included Bill Dickey, a coach for the Yankees who attended the game to scout both teams.|$|E
5|$|On July 11, 1914, Ruth {{arrived in}} Boston with Egan and Shore. Ruth later {{told the story}} of how that morning he had met Helen Woodford, who was the girl that would be his first wife. She was a 16-year-old {{waitress}} at Landers Coffee Shop, and Ruth related that she served him when he had breakfast there. Other stories, though, suggested that the meeting occurred on another day, and perhaps under other circumstances. Regardless of when he began to woo his first wife, he won his first game as a pitcher for the Red Sox that afternoon, 4–3, over the Cleveland Naps. His catcher was Bill Carrigan, who was also the Red Sox manager. Shore was given a start by Carrigan the next day; he won that and his second start and thereafter was pitched regularly. Ruth lost his second start, and was thereafter little used. As a batter in his major-league debut, Ruth went 0-for-2 against left-hander Willie Mitchell, striking out in his first at bat, before being removed for a pinch hitter <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning.</b> Ruth was not much noticed by the fans, as Bostonians watched the Red Sox's crosstown rivals, the Braves, begin a legendary comeback that would take them from last place on the Fourth of July to the 1914 World Series championship.|$|E

5|$|Robertson {{held the}} Phillies {{scoreless}} {{for a second}} inning in the fourth. Jorge Posada entered as a pinch hitter in the fifth inning for José Molina and grounded out. Eric Hinske then pinch hit for Robertson and walked, advanced to third on a Derek Jeter single, and scored on a ground out by Damon. Alfredo Aceves entered as the new Yankee pitcher {{in the bottom of}} the fifth. The first batter he faced, Jayson Werth, hit a deep drive to center field but it was caught for an out by Gardner, who collided into the outfield wall to complete the play. Aceves completed the inning without a run scoring, inducing ground outs from Ibáñez and Ruiz. Phil Coke relieved Aceves <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning</b> and allowed two Phillies players tie World Series records. First, Utley tied Reggie Jackson's record for most home runs in a World Series with a solo home run, his fifth of the series. Coke then struck out Howard, Howard's 12th strikeout in the series, tying Willie Wilson's record for most strikeouts in a World Series. Finally, Coke was driven from the game after allowing another solo home run, this time to Ibáñez, and was relieved by Phil Hughes.|$|E
5|$|The Yankees scored {{first for}} the second {{straight}} game, but Utley gave the lead back to Philadelphia on a three-run home run. Werth and Ibáñez drove in Utley and Howard in the third inning, which chased the starter, Burnett. David Robertson allowed another run to score on a Carlos Ruiz groundout. Eric Hinske, who entered as a pinch-hitter, scored on a ground out by Johnny Damon. Utley tied Reggie Jackson's record for most home runs in a World Series with a solo home run <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning,</b> his fifth of the series. Howard struck out for the 12th time in the series, tying Willie Wilson's 1980 record for most strikeouts in a World Series. Ibáñez hit a solo home run to chase pitcher Phil Coke. After being hit in the hand in the first inning, Victorino was replaced defensively in the eighth inning by Ben Francisco. Lee left the game after allowing two runs to score, and Park gave up a sacrifice fly to Robinson Canó to add another earned run to Lee's line. Ryan Madson entered in the ninth to close the game, allowing one run on a double play but earning his first career World Series save.|$|E
5|$|In the 2010 NLCS against Philadelphia, Rentería {{reclaimed}} {{a starting}} role {{when he started}} four games (the Giants benched third baseman Pablo Sandoval and shifted Uribe to third base). He only had one hit in the series, but he scored the winning run in the Giants' 3–0 victory in Game 3, and he retained the starting job in the World Series. In Game 2 of the series, against the Texas Rangers, he broke a scoreless tie in the fifth inning when he homered off C. J. Wilson to give the Giants a 1–0 lead. He later added a two-run single {{in the eighth inning}} as the Giants won 9–0. Before Game 5, with the Giants leading the series 3–1, Rentería joked with teammate Andrés Torres {{that he was going to}} hit a home run. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning,</b> with runners at second and third, two outs, and no score, Rentería hit a three-run home run off Rangers' pitcher Cliff Lee that won the series for the Giants. The feat made him only the fourth player to have two series-winning hits in history, along with Yogi Berra, Joe DiMaggio, and Lou Gehrig. For his contributions, he was named the 2010 World Series Most Valuable Player, making him the first player from Colombia to achieve this feat. The Giants declined his option on November 5, but Rentería did announce that he planned to play in 2011. The Giants did offer him a one-year, one million dollar contract as a utility player, but Rentería declined.|$|E
50|$|Arroyo {{finished}} the 2012 season by going 12-10 with a 3.74 ERA.

5|$|Mota began spring {{training}} with the Expos in 2002, but {{was traded to}} the Los Angeles Dodgers with outfielder Wilkin Ruan for pitcher Matt Herges and infielder Jorge Nunez on March 23. He failed to make the Dodgers' major league club in {{spring training}} and was assigned to the Las Vegas 51s of the triple-A Pacific Coast League to begin the season. He was called up on April 20 when Kevin Brown was placed on the disabled list. After appearing in two games, he was returned to Las Vegas on April 30 when Brown came off the disabled list. On May 17, he was called up a second time. In 22 games through July 14, he had a 2.43 ERA. On June 3, he pitched a scoreless inning and earned the win in an 11–5 victory over the Colorado Rockies. However, he was returned to Las Vegas on July 28 after he had a loss and a 13.50 ERA over his next seven games. He did not return to the Dodgers until August 26, when Kevin Beirne was demoted to the minors. That same day, he was the losing pitcher when he gave up three runs (two earned) in his third inning of work in a 12-inning 6–3 loss to Arizona. He was the losing pitcher again on September 13 when he gave up three runs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning</b> and blew a 4–2 lead over Colorado. He posted a 3.92 ERA over his final 14 games of the year to finish with a 1–3 record and a 4.15 ERA in 43 games. With the 51s, he had a 1–3 record with a 2.95 ERA in 20 games.|$|E
5|$|The Phillies' offense {{benefited from}} rest {{due to the}} {{postponement}} of {{the final game of}} the Padres' series, as they defeated the Milwaukee Brewers in the opener of their mid-week series, 11–4.

Phillies starter Cole Hamels was hit by a line drive in the fourth inning and exited the game; before departing, he had retired nine out of the ten batters he faced. Hitting the road for a series against the division-leading Florida Marlins, the Phillies were shut out through eight innings in {{the first game of the}} series, only to score seven runs in the top of the ninth against power-throwing closer Matt Lindstrom, winning the game, 7–3, thanks to Shane Victorino's first career regular season grand slam. The following night's game offered another come-from-behind win for the Phillies, as they trailed in the ninth again to win in extra innings, 6–4, and the 13–2 victory on April 26 capped the team's first series sweep. Hosting Washington for their second series against the Nationals, the Phillies fell behind <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>seventh</b> <b>inning</b> before a grand slam by Ibáñez capped their 13–11 victory; combined with Ryan Howard's game-tying grand slam in the fifth inning, this was only the fourth time in Phillies history that teammates hit grand slams in the same game.
