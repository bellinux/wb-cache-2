40|$|A novel {{low-power}} synthesis {{technique is}} presented {{for the design}} of folded or time-multiplexed programmable-coefficient FIR filters where storage area is traded-off for lowering power consumption. A systematic technique is developed for low power mapping of FIR filters to architectures with arbitrary number of multipliers and adders. Power consumed in multipliers is reduced by reducing switching activity at both the data-input as well as the coefficient input. In order to increase common inputs to multipliers the transpose-form representation of the FIR filter is used. As opposed to the direct-form the transpose-form representation exposes common <b>data</b> <b>inputs</b> of a <b>filter</b> in an explicit manner.

Each {{row in the}} profile window keeps metadata extracted from a randomly chosen tuple t of the <b>input</b> <b>data</b> stream.

The per-tuple processing costs of the <b>input</b> <b>filters</b> are estimated using a simple averaging technique. For each tuple that is randomly chosen to extract metadata from (regarding which of the <b>input</b> <b>filters</b> have dropped it or not), A-greedy also measures the time each filter spends to process that tuple.

30|$|Attribute-based filtering: In several trust models, <b>input</b> <b>data</b> is <b>filtered</b> {{based on}} a constraint-factor defined {{for the value of}} single attributes. Attribute-based filters mostly {{implement}} a very simple logic, in which an attribute is usually compared to a reference value.

Besides the initial <b>filtering</b> of <b>input</b> <b>data,</b> it is often applied after the weighting phase in order to filter referrals that have been strongly discounted. Time is an example of an attribute that is often constrained because it is desirable to disregard very old ratings. eBay’s reputation system, for instance, only considers transactions having occurred in the last 12 months for their overview of positive, neutral and negative ratings. Other models such as Sporas [15] ignore every referral but the latest, if one party rated another party more than once. In this way, simple ballot stuffing attacks can be prevented. In ballot stuffing attacks, parties improve their reputation by means of positive ratings after fake transactions.|$|R

40|$|At {{the point}} when an <b>Input</b> <b>filter</b> {{is added to the}} {{converter}} it decreases the electromagnetic Interference (EMI) of power input of converter and enhances the performance of load. Electromagnetic Interference (EMI) is disturbance because of either electromagnetic induction or electromagnetic radiation discharged from outside source that influence the electrical circuit. The EMI may interfere with or decrease the performance of the electrical circuit. Thus an <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> is for the most part used to lessen the electromagnetic interference in power source side of a converter. The <b>Input</b> <b>filter</b> added to converter to diminish the electromagnetic interference may change the system transfer function, which may bring about instability and influence the performance of the converter. In this way, <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> ought to be such that it will diminish the electromagnetic interference and it ought not to influence the performance and the stability of the system. Different stability criteria are considered in this undertaking to outline an <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> without influencing the performance and the stability of the system. One such criterion is Middlebrook's stability criterion which is chiefly utilized for designing <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> for DC-DC converters. The Middlebrook Criterion was at first proposed to investigate how the stability of a feedback-controlled switching converter is influenced by the addition of an <b>input</b> <b>filter.</b> Its objective is to ensure stability of the system, as well as to guarantee that converter dynamics are not changed by the presence of an <b>input</b> <b>filter.</b> The Middlebrook Criterion gives a basic designoriented sufficient stability condition imposing a small-gain condition on the minor loop gain. In this thesis the design of <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> for various converters using Middlebrook Criterion is studied...|$|R
40|$|A novel <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> {{compensation}} scheme for a buck regulator that eliminates {{the interaction between}} the <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> output impedance and the regulator control loop is presented. The scheme is implemented using a feedforward loop that senses the <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> state variables and uses this information to modulate the duty cycle signal. The feedforward design process presented is seen to be straightforward and the feedforward easy to implement. Extensive experimental data supported by analytical results show that significant performance improvement is achieved with the use of feedforward in the following performance categories: loop stability, audiosusceptibility, output impedance and transient response. The use of feedforward results in isolating the switching regulator from its power source thus eliminating all interaction between the regulator and equipment upstream. In addition the use of feedforward removes some of the <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> design constraints and makes the <b>input</b> <b>filter</b> design process simpler thus making it possible to optimize the <b>input</b> <b>filter.</b> The concept of feedforward compensation can also be extended to other types of switching regulators...|$|R

Many active methods have been proposed to stabilize the interaction between LC <b>input</b> <b>filters</b> and CPLs. Compared with the mature study of active methods for stabilization of inverter based CPLs and LC <b>input</b> <b>filters,</b> there are few active methods proposed for stabilization of DC/DC converter based CPLs and LC <b>input</b> <b>filters.</b> Due to the difference between inverter based CPLs and DC/DC converter based CPLs in power stage dynamics and feedback controllers, applying the active methods for inverter based CPLs directly to DC/DC converter based CPLs may not achieve an optimal performance or may not even work. To address this problem, in the thesis, an optimal active method is proposed for DC/DC converters under voltage mode control. The proposed methods can increase a larger stability margin and simultaneously have smaller audio susceptibility than the existing methods. The thesis also proposed another active method for DC/DC converters under current mode control. The proposed method results in a larger stability margin than the existing method. This thesis also contributes to the stabilization of LC <b>input</b> <b>filters</b> and CPLs from source side converters. The main advantage of this method is that it eliminates the drawback of the active stabilization method via adding a feedforward loop which enlarges the system audio susceptibility.
