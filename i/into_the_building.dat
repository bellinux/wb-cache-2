In July 2005, water from the river began seeping <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> site, through crevices in a corner where the foundation wall meets the Wabash Avenue Bridge. Divers discovered that the leak could not be sealed from the water side.

The Chrysler Corporation moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> in 1930 and used the tower as its {{division}} headquarters until the 1950s. The mapmaking company Texaco and the magazine magnate Henry Luce were also two of the original tenants. Texaco moved out in 1977 because it wanted a more suburban workplace in Purchase, New York, for its employees. Luce's company Time Inc. was headquartered in the building until 1937, when it moved to the Rockefeller Center due to the latter containing more office space.|$|E

In the ensuing battle between the two forces, more than 75 hostages died (including 11 judges).

5|$|The Cold War {{led to the}} {{expansion}} of national defense government programs housed in offices in Northern Virginia near Washington, D.C., and correlative population growth. The Central Intelligence Agency in Langley was involved in various Cold War events, including as the target of Soviet espionage activities. Also among the federal developments was the Pentagon, built during World War II as the headquarters for the Department of Defense. It was one of the targets of the September 11 attacks; 189 people died at the site when a jet passenger plane was crashed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>building.</b>|$|E
5|$|The {{area around}} the {{building}} was cleared of pedestrians and firefighting personnel because of falling glass and debris. The falling debris was dangerous for firefighters because they often had to cross the perimeter around the building to enter and leave the high-rise. Hose lines stretched <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> were damaged by falling debris and one firefighter was struck by debris and seriously injured while tending to the lines.|$|E

5|$|After {{the arrival}} of the strikebreakers on the {{afternoon}} of November 2, Indianapolis Police Chief Martin Hyland had mounted city police escort them from Indianapolis Union Station to the company's maintenance and storage carhouses, one block south of the terminal building. The police broke a path through the strikers to allow the strikebreakers <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> so they could prepare to launch the cars. Organized labor leaders held two mass meetings and unions across the city agreed to send additional men to support the strikers against the strikebreakers. A riot began as the strikebreakers attempted to restore transit service. Whenever the strikebreakers launched a streetcar from the storage barns, the strikers attacked them with rocks and brick. They boarded the streetcars, dragged the crews from the cars and lit the cars on fire. Many injuries occurred on both sides and ambulances were called to carry the injured to a hospital. After the destruction of six cars, the strikebreakers abandoned their attempts to restart service.|$|E
5|$|Begun in 1292, the Anglican parish {{church of}} St John the Baptist {{gradually}} evolved until taking its present general form {{during the reign}} of Charles II, after the tower collapsed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>building</b> during a storm in 1632. The tower, built over the north-east corner of the nave, now rises in three stages over the Western entrance and is surmounted by a pierced parapet and short croketted pinnacles and {{is said to have been}} built from the ruins of the abbey church. The south aisle and south porch date from 1390. The chancel, then the responsibility of the abbey, was rebuilt in 1470 and further restoration was carried out in 1634–1655, following the collapse of the tower. There is a pulpit dating from 1634 and is also a screen of the same age which shuts off the choir vestry. It has been designated as a Grade II* listed building.|$|E
