Three <b>trails</b> of <b>loading</b> 5000 coconuts in the dryer were carried out {{during the month of}} January, 2014. The biomass backup heater was used after 5 PM where there would be no sufficient solar radiation and was loaded with the remains of coconut such as coconut fronts, coconut husk and coconut shells which {{could be used as a}} fuel for biomass heater. The drying time and the product quality were the main deciding performance parameters of the dryer which are studied in comparison with the traditional drying method (open sun drying). It was found that the coconuts which has an initial moisture content of 53. 84 % (w. b.) were dried to final moisture content of 7. 003 % (w. b.) in the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer for a time period of 44 hours whereas the open sun drying method took 148 hours for the reduction of moisture content of the coconuts to the same level. Also, the superior quality coconuts can be produced from the solar tunnel greenhouse dryer since the dryer is free from contamination, dust & dirt, damage by birds and infections by bacteria and fungus.

The Transfer Assessment Instrument (TAI) is the first tool to standardize the way clinicians evaluate transfer techniques and to help identify specific skills to target during transfer training. The study was to validate the function of the TAI, indicate the effects of transfer skills in performing toilet transfers in two different setups, and evaluate the immediate effects of individualized TAI-based structured transfer training. Up to twenty-six WUs performed transfers to a level-height bench and a toilet with a side and front setup while force plates, load cells, and a motion capture system recorded the biomechanics of their natural transferring skills. Their skills were simultaneously evaluated by two clinicians using the TAI. Logistic and multiple linear regression models were used to determine the relationships between TAI scores and the joint kinetic variables on both arms. Multivariate analysis of variance models were built to test biomechanical differences between using and non-using skill groups during toilet transfers with a side and front setup respectively. Wilcoxon signed-rank test was used to compare the differences of the biomechanical variables between pre and post TAI-based transfer training. The results showed that the completion of TAI skills was associated with lower resultant moments and/or their rates of rise at both shoulders and/or elbows (p< 0. 02). Some skills increased the moment magnitude or rate on the leading side (p< 0. 03). Compared to WUs who did not use skills, WUs who scooted forward in their wheelchair and used an appropriate handgrip and head-hip techniques had better shoulder positioning and lower joint forces and moments on both arms in toilet transfers with a side setup (p< 0. 04), and WUs who used close wheelchair positioning had significantly lower <b>trailing</b> arm <b>loading</b> (p= 0. 03) in a front setup. The TAI-based transfer training intervention improved the leading shoulder posture (p< 0. 04) and reduced the joint forces and moments and their rates on both shoulders and trailing elbow and wrist (p< 0. 05). Structured training and the routine practice of TAI skills is recommended to help reduce the risk of developing secondary injuries...|$|R

We address these areas by a study of chronically HIV- 1 -infected subjects followed through antiretroviral therapy (ART) interruption and by testing PDC cytolytic function against autologous HIV-infected CD 4 T cells. Rebound in viremia induced by therapy interruption showed a positive association between <b>TRAIL</b> and viral <b>load</b> or T-cell activation, but comparable levels of plasma IFN-/ were found in viremic ART-treated and control subjects.

Moreover, no significant increase in death receptor 5 (DR 5) expression was seen in CD 4 T cells from viremic HIV subjects compared to controls or following in vitro infection/exposure to infectious and noninfectious virus or exogenous IFN-, respectively. Although activated PDC killed the DR 5 -expressing HIV-infected Sup-T 1 cell line, PDC did not lyse primary autologous HIV CD 4 T cells yet could provide accessory help for NK cells in killing HIV-infected autologous CD 4 T cells.

40|$|During {{uncontrolled}} HIV disease, both TNF-related apoptosis inducing ligand (TRAIL) and TRAIL receptor expression are increased. Enhanced TRAIL sensitivity {{is due to}} TRAIL receptor up-regulation {{induced by}} gp 120. As a result of successful antiretroviral therapy TRAIL is down-regulated, and there are fewer TRAIL-sensitive cells. In this setting, we hypothesized that all cells that contain virus, including those productively- and latently-infected, have necessarily been "primed" by gp 120 and remain TRAIL-sensitive, whereas uninfected cells remain relatively TRAIL-resistant. We evaluated the immunologic and antiviral effects of TRAIL in peripheral blood lymphocytes collected from HIV-infected patients with suppressed viral replication. The peripheral blood lymphocytes were treated with recombinant TRAIL or an equivalent amount of bovine serum albumin as a negative control. Treated cells were then analyzed by quantitative flow cytometry, ELISPOT for CD 4 + and CD 8 + T-cell function, and limiting dilution microculture for viral burden. Alterations in the cytokine milieu of treated cells were assessed with a multiplex cytokine assay. Treatment with recombinant TRAIL in vitro reduced viral burden in lymphocytes collected from HIV-infected patients with suppressed viral <b>load.</b> <b>TRAIL</b> treatment did not alter the cytokine milieu of treated cells. Moreover, treatment with recombinant TRAIL had no adverse effect on either the quantity or function of immune cells from HIV-infected patients with suppressed viral replication.
