Louis Agassiz was an American and Swiss pseudo-scientist and professor who supported scientific racism and argued for Eurocentric racial categorizations of humans in the 19th century. The <b>Demounting</b> Louis Agassiz petition has collected over 2,500 signatures internationally to {{change the name of}} this peak to honor Renty, an enslaved man of Congolese descent who was photographed on a plantation in South Carolina as part of Agassiz’s project. Huber continued her research into Agassiz with Brazilian historian Maria Clara Machado, publishing (T)races of Louis Agassiz: Photography, Body and Science, Yesterday and Today (2010) as part of an exhibition for the 29th Sao Paulo Art Biennial in 2010.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Demounting</b> is {{the process}} of {{removing}} a print from the mounting material. This is often done because older mounts were usually made from acidic paper materials that can deteriorate the paper or fade colorants. Mounts are usually adhered to prints through adhesive agents that can cause yellow distortions on the paper.|$|E

50|$|The AK3 is {{the third}} two-seat, single engine, low wing design from André Kieger. It is {{produced}} by Junkers Profly France and is alternatively known as the Junkers Profly Junka UL. The wing has a single spar with a plywood leading edge and a false spar for the mounting of ailerons and flaps. Production aircraft have small winglets. Each wing is fixed to the fuselage {{with a pair of}} sailplane style pins for rapid <b>demounting.</b> The fuselage is built around four longerons, giving it a square lower section; the upper fuselage is rounded and merges into the line of the large perspex canopy over the side-by-side seating. The tailplane is mounted on top of the fuselage and the fin is swept; both are plywood structures. There are horn balances on elevators and rudder.|$|E

40|$|Waxes and thermopolymers are {{commonly}} used to mount optical and photonic materials prior to polishing and singularization. After <b>demounting,</b> residual wax/thermopolymer can adhere to the component surface, frequently {{in the form of}} particles. Dry, ultraviolet-pulsed laser cleaning has been demonstrated to effectively remove paraffin wax particles, prepared on a glass surface using a wax aerosol technique. This method produces dome-shaped particles. Experimental evidence suggests the dome-shaped particles are vaporized by the absorption of the energy from the laser pulse. A theoretical model based on vaporization has been developed and this leads to predictions of the critical fluence for single laser pulse removal of dome-shaped particles which is in good agreement with that experimentally measured (220 mJ/cm²). The model also gives insight into the geometries and relative thermal properties of the "particles" and surface, which are important in determining whether removal by vaporization is a viable process 8 page(s...|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Modern {{sliding table}} saws are {{equipped}} with several passive safety devices. However, alone in Germany several hundred severe injuries or limb amputations occur each year due disregarding safety regulations and <b>demounting</b> of passive safety devices. Thus an active safety system is developed {{in order to protect}} the machine user. For this purpose, a multi sensor system for hazard analysis based on infrared and capacitive sensors is applied. When a dangerous situation is recognized by the developed sensors, the system triggers a rapid saw blade braking device. The hazard analysis is carried out by means of an information fusion of the sensor signals based on a Bayesian network. For the fusion process the measurement values of the sensors have to preprocessed appropriately. The system is implemented in C and LabView and runs in real-time. Validation tests have shown the very reliable function of the developed hazard analysis. Bayesian network, measurement fusion, infrared sensor, capacitive sensor, hazard analysis...|$|E

40|$|A conceptually {{improved}} {{sensor network}} {{to monitor the}} partial pressure of CO 2 in different soil horizons was designed. Consisting of five membrane-based linear sensors (line-sensors) each with 10 m length, the set-up enables us to integrate over the locally fluctuating CO 2 concentrations (typically lower 5 %vol) up to the meter-scale gaining valuable concentration means with a repetition time of about 1 min. Preparatory tests in the laboratory resulted in a unexpected highly increased accuracy of better than 0. 03 %vol {{with respect to the}} previously published 0. 08 %vol. Thereby, the statistical uncertainties (standard deviations) of the line-sensors and the reference sensor (nondispersive infrared CO 2 -sensor) were close to each other. Whereas the uncertainty of the reference increases with the measurement value, the line-sensors show an inverse uncertainty trend resulting in a comparatively enhanced accuracy for concentrations &gt; 1 %vol. Furthermore, a method for in situ maintenance was developed, enabling a proof of sensor quality and its effective calibration without <b>demounting</b> the line-sensors from the soil which would disturb the established structures and ongoing processes...|$|E

40|$|A {{radio-frequency}} quadrupole (RFQ) linear accel-erator {{has been}} constructed {{and placed in}} operation on the Los Alamos National Laboratory accelerator test stand (ATS). This accelerator uses an evacuated rf manifold to distribute rf excitation from the 425 -MHz rf power supply to the slot-coupled, RFQ vane-cavity, resonator assembly. The RFQ vanes are supported on commercially available copper-plated, linear, resili-ent "C-seals " to provide a high-conductivity rf con-tact that permits aligning and positioning the vanes during tuning, and <b>demounting</b> the vanes for evaluation and modification as necessary. All rf structures are fabricated from stress-relieved, bright-acid copper-plated carbon steel. Measurements made on the accelerator as assembled have demonstrated> 8000 vane-cavity Q at the quad-rupole's x 423. 400 -MHz accelerating-mode frequency. Operating manifold vacuum of 3 - 6 x 10 -G torr has been observed after rf conditioning; conditioning required 150 h for stable high-power rf operation. Experience to date has indicated the desirability of modifying the vane rf-contact seat configuration to improve assembly and alignment procedures, improving vane-machining processes to increase vane straight-ness, installing periodic vane-shorting rings to mini-mize the effect of dipole modes in the quadrupole accelerating structure, and modifying the waveguide-coupling slot in the manifold to improve forward rf power flow...|$|E
