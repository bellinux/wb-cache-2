50|$|Railroads have strict government-approved {{air brake}} testing {{procedures}} for various circumstances when assembling trains or switching out cars en route. After a cut is made between cars in a train {{and the train}} is rejoined, {{in addition to other}} tests, the crew must verify that the brakes apply and release on the rear car (to ensure that all of the brake hoses are connected and the angle cocks, or valves, are opened). In most cases, the engineer is able to use information from the ETD to verify that the air pressure reduces and increases {{at the rear of the}} train accordingly, indicating that proper brake pipe continuity. This device is said to constitute a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>condition.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{design and}} {{analysis}} of a composite fan blade for the under the wing (UTW) QCSEE is presented. The blade is designed for a variable pitch, 18 bladed rotor and is constructed from a hybrid composite combination of materials consisting of Kevlar- 49, type AS graphite, boron, and S-glass fibers in a PR 288 epoxy resin matrix. The blade has an attached platform which is constructed of AS-graphite, PR 288 epoxy resin matrix and aluminum honeycomb. The blade is designed to satisfy aerostability and cyclic life and strength requirements with a light weight construction. The attached platform is designed for a <b>fail-safe</b> <b>condition</b> {{in that it is}} retainable by the blade, under centrifugal force loading, even in the event of blade to platform bond separation. Details of the blade design and the results of stress, vibration, and impact analysis are included...|$|E
40|$|Nowadays the {{structural}} verification of unmanned spacecraft programmes follows typically a protoflight approach 1, wherein the flight structure is tested to levels somewhat above limit stress (or load) but below yield strength, {{rather than the}} more conventional prototype approach. Often, such option implies exposing flight items to extensive fatigue loading (incl. on-ground vibration testing {{at different levels of}} integration). Usually, as far as possible, the structures are designed to be hyperstatic (i. e. with multiple load paths) to ensure sufficient strength for enduring the loading environment even in <b>fail-safe</b> <b>condition.</b> In a hyperstatic design, when one of the load paths is lost due to local failure, the loads may redistribute among the remaining structure preventing the complete failure. In many cases, owing to restrictive design and mission requirements, {{it is not possible to}} realize redundant structures and it is necessary to introduce one or more critical structural items like isostatic mounts in the main load path, being these widely used in unmanned spacecraft designs. These are typically monolithic parts constituting a single-point-failure of the design and must be considered Potential Fracture Critical Items under a reduced fracture control programme. Normally their damage tolerance capacity is demonstrated via crack-growth analysis. For a crack-growth evaluation it is necessary to derive the stress spectra for each event phase of the operating life and afterwards define the complete stress spectra in the most critical areas. Typically the isostatic mounts are designed to support relatively large masses (e. g. optical benches, etc.); these items have their design optimized for (a certain level of) flexibility in order to comply with alignment and stability (e. g. of the optical bench) under extreme environmental conditions. These requirements drive the design, frequently resulting in parts with regions of reduced cross-section and relatively high stresses...|$|E

40|$|New flow {{effector}} {{technology for}} separation control and enhanced mixing {{is based upon}} shape memory alloy hybrid composite (SMAHC) technology. The technology allows for variable shape control of aircraft structures through actively deformable surfaces. The flow effectors are made by embedding shape memory alloy actuator material in a composite structure. When thermally actuated, the flow effector def 1 ects into {{or out of the}} flow in a prescribed manner to enhance mixing or induce separation for a variety of applications, including aeroacoustic noise reduction, drag reduction, and f 1 ight control. The active flow effectors were developed for noise reduction as an alternative to fixed-configuration effectors, such as static chevrons, that cannot be optimized for airframe installation effects or variable operating conditions and cannot be retracted for off-design or <b>fail-safe</b> <b>conditions.</b> Benefits include: Increased vehicle control, overall efficiency, and reduced noise throughout all f 1 ight regimes, Reduced flow noise, Reduced drag, Simplicity of design and fabrication, Simplicity of control through direct current stimulation, autonomous re sponse to environmental heating, fast re sponse, and a high degree of geometric stability. The concept involves embedding prestrained SMA actuators {{on one side of the}} chevron neutral axis in order to generate a thermal moment and def 1 ect the structure out of plane when heated. The force developed in the host structure during def 1 ection and the aerodynamic load is used for returning the structure to the retracted position. The chevron design is highly scalable and versatile, and easily affords active and/or autonomous (environmental) control. The technology offers wide-ranging market applications, including aerospace, automotive, and any application that requires flow separation or noise control...|$|R
40|$|Two main aspects {{have been}} {{analyzed}} in this thesis: first {{the effects of}} a primary actuator failures on the aircraft have been fully investigated in term of stability, handling criteria and trimmability in failed condition; then a reconfiguration mechanism following the failure of the rudder has been developed. All the analysis has been limited to the approach phase therefore only the Landing Gear Down Mode of the Control Law has been considered. Initially all the factors that can lead a primary actuator to engage the Fail Safe Mode are reviewed and the probability for each actuator to engage the fail safe mode quantified. The aircraft simulation environment has been modified to include the Fail Safe Modes. Analysing the effects of different <b>Fail-Safe</b> <b>conditions</b> (HT, AIL, RUD) on the aircraft it has been observed that there is a single major degradation, the loss of controllability of the directional axis following the failure of the rudder. The failures generally cause an increase in Gain Margin due to the reduction of the control power derivatives. A reconfiguration scheme has been developed for the case of rudder failure. Two possible approaches are developed and then joined together into the final reconfiguration mechanism. The first approach exploits the redundancy provided by the independent use of ailerons and differential horizontal tail to produce a limited yawing moment. It has been evidenced how that solution is not a good solution to generate large AoS while is a viable solution to restore a limited authority but efficient yaw-damper. The second approach used for the reconfiguration makes use of a single aileron like a spoiler in order {{to increase the amount of}} available yawing moment...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{summarizes}} the preliminary design {{work of a}} new subsurface safety valve (SSSV) for extreme high pressure (30, 000 psi) and high temperature (450 Â°F) (XHPHT) applications. Current SSSV designs are not reliable in current production environments and certainly will not be qualified to <b>fail-safe</b> under XHPHT <b>conditions.</b> In this design stage, a quasi-static study on the fluid structure interactions of a flapper SSSV is conducted. A parametric 3 D CAD model of a flapper SSSV is built in Solidworks. Then computational fluid dynamics (CFD) analysis is conducted in AnsysRTM CFX. CFD results and the water hammer pressure surge calculated are successfully imported into AnsysRTM Workbench followed by a finite element analysis (FEA) of the stresses. Flappers with different sealing types are compared and summarized. This study is a necessary step for the next design stage, which supplies information that might result in a technical step change in the SSSV design...|$|R
