Common fabrics include polyester and fiberglass and common fabric coatings include PTFE (commonly known as Teflon).

25|$|The {{temperatures}} {{needed to}} break down dioxin are typically not reached when burning plastics outdoors in a burn barrel or garbage pit, causing high dioxin emissions as mentioned above. While plastic does usually burn in an open-air fire, the dioxins remain after combustion and either float off into the atmosphere, or may remain in the ash {{where it can be}} leached down into groundwater when rain falls on the ash pile. Fortunately, dioxin and furan compounds bond very strongly to solid surfaces and are not dissolved by water, so leaching processes are limited to the first few millimeters below the ash pile. The gas-phase dioxins can be substantially destroyed using catalysts, some of which can be present as part of the <b>fabric</b> <b>filter</b> bag structure.|$|E

The general principle is to use heat or pressure to pulse air through top of the <b>fabric</b> <b>filter</b> material to detach the collected particles from the bags. [...] "Fines" [...] particles such as ash and dust will be filtrated out and collected into a fines discharge box. Alternatively, the fines can be reintroduced into the original product stream with a [...] "blow-through" [...] type rotary valve. The cleaned gas will be deposited into atmosphere by industrial exhaust fan and stack.|$|E

50|$|After {{being accused}} of violating New Source Review {{standards}} in 2000, PSEG settled with federal regulators and entered into a consent decree in 2002, which mandated the installation of emission controls at Hudson. In 2010, the facility completed installation of back-end technology to control emissions at the station: selective catalytic reduction to control nitrogen oxides, dry scrubbers to control sulfur dioxide, activated carbon injection to control mercury, and a pulse jet <b>fabric</b> <b>filter</b> system to control particulate emissions. Despite the $700 million USD investment in improvements in the facility some activists still consider it a detriment to the community.|$|E
50|$|The {{station was}} {{constructed}} with 4 English Electric 350 MW turbo-alternators. Munmorah {{had a total}} capacity of 1,400 MW. Steam was supplied at a pressure of 2,500 psi and a temperature of 460 °C. One unit was completed in 1967, another in 1968, and the remaining two in 1969. Units 3 and 4 had <b>fabric</b> <b>filters</b> fitted in the 1980s, and this reduced load to 320 MW each. Units 1 and 2 were relegated to emergency use from 1992.|$|R
40|$|World wide {{the focus}} on the health impact of fine {{particles}} in the atmosphere is increasing and regulatory restrictions on size dependent emission are expected soon to add to the ever descending total mass limits of all countries. The content of hazardous particles may be reduced either by means of sophisticated devices targeting the fine fraction directly or simply aim at reducing the total mass emission to “zero”. The latter may be done by <b>fabric</b> <b>filters</b> or by means of high efficient ESPs and is expected to comply with the demands. Barrier filters are characterized by having eliminated many of the non-ideal boundary conditions that maintain the ESP on higher emission levels – either due to constant contributions (re-entrainment, sneakage) or intermittent contributions (rapping loss). Many of these effects may be eliminated or minimised in ESPs e. g. by means of an efficient baffling system, electrode optimisation, etc. This paper describes a series of case stories where dust emission is reduced to the 1 - 10 mg/Nm 3 range and has a low content of fine particles (PM 2. 5) as well. This shows that in many cases dry ESPs as well as <b>fabric</b> <b>filters</b> are valid alternatives as “best available technology ” (BAT) in fine particulate removal. ...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This paper details {{results of}} an initial study into the {{feasibility}} of using the mechanical milling process {{as a means of}} embedding catalyst particles into <b>fabric</b> <b>filters</b> for improved pollution control. The specific combinations of catalysts and filters used in the study to demonstrate the method are currently being explored for use in the energy generation industry to help remove elemental mercury from flue gases. Circular fabric samples were placed in a hardened steel milling vial along with a number of PMMA milling balls. Catalyst powder and, in some cases, a solvent (water or 70 % isopropyl alcohol) were added and the vial milled for 40 minutes. The fabric samples were then dried and subjected to airflow conditions typical for <b>fabric</b> <b>filters</b> in powerplant baghouses. Weight measurements were used to determine the amount of catalyst retained in the fabric at each stage. Results show that fabric type, number of milling balls used, catalyst powder/fabric mass ratio, particle size and the presence of a solvent can all affect the degree of catalyst loading. The embedded particles adhere well through a number of forward/back pulse cycles simulating airflow conditions in a powerplant baghouse. Modifications are needed to scale such a process to production levels but the current limitations are not insurmountable...|$|R

The predominant types of wastes tested included chlorinated organic compounds, aromatic compounds, and metalcontaminated waste oil. The kiln types include lime kilns and cement kilns, which included the dry, wet, and preheated processes. <b>Fabric</b> <b>filters</b> and electrostatic precipitators (ESPs) were the pollution control devices used in these processes, and the primary fuels included coal, coke, coal/coke, fuel oil, and natural gas/coke.

At each of the retrofitted 300 MW power units 14,600 ash-catching bags that achieve the best filtration of the flue gases have been installed replacing the obsolete electrostatic precipitators, which implied dismantling of roughly 3,000 tons of metal works. At Unit 5, the modernization works included installation of low-emission burners, which would allow to significantly reduce NOx emissions. Alongside the environmental impact, the retrofitting works at № 4 and № 5 have helped to improve reliability and efficiency of the units.|$|R

The filters will lead to a reduction in ash emissions from Unit 7 by roughly 99.9%, equivalent to the saving of up to more than 10,000 tons of emissions per year. The project was implemented within the framework of Enel Russia’s Environmental Program, as part of the Agreement for Environmental Cooperation signed by Enel Russia and the Government of the Sverdlovsk Region in 2011. Unit 7 modernization operation have helped improve reliability and efficiency of the overall unit, as well as considerably decreasing the heat rate. Within the retrofitting, alongside the installation of <b>fabric</b> <b>filters,</b> namely 16,800 ash-catching bags that achieve the best filtration of the flue gases, a new generator was installed at Unit 7. Moreover, both the gas ducts and the sealing system of the regenerative air preheater were modernized, resulting in a decrease of air flows from the air section of the preheater to the gas section by 2.5-3 times that leads to a lower rate of own electricity use and {{a significant increase in the}} boiler’s efficiency.|$|R
