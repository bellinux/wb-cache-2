40|$|Application of vacuum {{insulation}} in cryo-installations, for example cryocables, requires investigations made on specimens and laboratory arrangements {{which would be}} very close to those met in practice. To explain the influence of arrangement parameters on <b>flash-over</b> <b>voltage</b> in vacuum the following investigations {{were made in the}} first stage: measurements of the influence of the electrode diameters and of the pressure on the <b>flash-over</b> <b>voltage</b> of ceramic spacer insulators. The pressure influence investigations were also aimed to clear some literature problems on the subject...|$|E
40|$|The {{measurements}} of flash-over voltages on solid insulation, placed in vacuum {{have shown the}} initial flash-over occur at voltages considerably lower than this obtained after multiple flash-over. It can be proved that the initial <b>flash-over</b> <b>voltage</b> increase is mainly connected with gas desorption from the insulator electrodes surfaces. As the surface is being cleaned of gas particles the insulator sparking voltage is increasing, hence the energy of particles bombarding the insulator surface is also increasing...|$|E
40|$|Under {{nanosecond}} pulsed coaxial electric field, surface flashover voltage {{over the}} interfaces between nylon 1010 and transformer oil increases almost linearly with gap length, and the steeper rising edge of applied pulse, the higher <b>flash-over</b> <b>voltage.</b> Surface flashover properties {{are closely related}} to the electric field at the triple junctions of solid-liquid-electrode and the field gradient along the interfaces. Although the increased difference between inner and outer electrode radii will enhance electric field strength at the triple junctions and nonuniformity degree of potential distribution along interfaces, it reduces simultaneously terribly the surface field strength of coaxial inner electrode, so that flashover voltage doesn’t descend, but ascends almost linearly with gap length. The average flashover strength in coaxial electric field can be estimated by that in uniform electric field for large enough difference between inner and outer electrode radii, which is useful to practical engineering design for coaxial pulsed power apparatuses...|$|E
50|$|Insulators {{for very}} high voltages, {{exceeding}} 200 kV, may have grading rings installed at their terminals. This improves the electric field distribution around the insulator {{and makes it}} more resistant to <b>flash-over</b> during <b>voltage</b> surges.|$|R
40|$|The {{experiments}} {{performed by}} the author of this paper: (1) A. C. dry flash-over test was performed，under the conditions somewhat different from the conventional ones，both on a suspension insulator in normal conditions and that with some broken porcelain parts. -Report I-(October 1959) (2) A. C. dry flash-over test was performed on two suspension insulators with greatly damaged porcelain parts. -Report II-(November 1959) (3) Impulse voltage was applied experimentally to one suspension insulator in normal conditions and two insulators with some broken parts. -Report III-(October, 1963) The material used in the experiment reported in the present paper was the same of those used in the test (3) above，where the testing condition was {{different from that of the}} foregolng tests in the point that the insulator was fully soaked in the water before it was applied the voltage. The result obtained in this occasion was that the falling ratio of the <b>flash-over</b> <b>voltage</b> read (was observed to be) 10 - 12 %，which indicated that a neat clean surface of the insulator even wet with water did not result in so great a falling of the voltage, though influenced by the humidity of the atmospere as usual in this case. In the observation，which had been kept on since the time of Report I, of distributions of the discharging directions，the discharging route was observed not always gathering along the short-cut distances. The causes and other aspects of this phenomenon are left to be studied further. ...|$|E
