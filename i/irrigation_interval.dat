The results indicated that the amount of dry matter productions at 20, 40 and 60 DAP were found to be higher with increasing amounts of PAM in soil and decreasing intervals between 2 consecutive irrigations. Similar relationships were found for plant height at maturity. Soybeans grown in soils treated with 0. 05, 0. 1 and 0. 2 % PAM achieved grain productions which were about 6, 9 and 14 times greater, respectively, than that in control soil under 3 days of <b>irrigation</b> <b>interval.</b> It was also found that 0. 05 % PAM in soil with 4 days <b>irrigation</b> <b>interval</b> and 0. 1 % PAM in soil with 5 days <b>irrigation</b> <b>interval</b> enabled plants to achieve grain yields higher than that of control soil with 3 days <b>irrigation</b> <b>interval.</b> Therefore, crops in coarse textured soils treated with polymers can produce more grain or dry matter yield often under low frequent irrigations. It can also help to save water, time, money and energy which otherwise spent on high frequency irrigations. These findings also have potential beneficial implications to growing garden plants, pot plants, glasshouse plants and/or general horticulture...|$|E

40|$|The {{water stress}} effects caused by every-other-furrow {{irrigation}} on yield may be alleviated by more frequent <b>irrigation</b> <b>intervals.</b> This {{research was conducted}} to determine yield and water use efficiency of grain sorghum under fixed and variable every-other-furrow and every furrow irrigations at different <b>irrigation</b> <b>intervals</b> and shallow and deep water table conditions. Water needs of grain sorghum grown on a fine-texture soil may not be met by using Every-Other Furrow Irrigation (EOFI) especially under 15 and 20 day <b>irrigation</b> <b>intervals.</b> The water stress decreased the grain yield mainly through decreasing the number of grains per cluster and in a lesser degree by decrease in 1000 -seed weight. The clay soil {{with a layer of}} high clay content at depth of 70 - 100 cm and shallow water table may restrict the root growth and consequently the longer <b>irrigation</b> <b>intervals</b> with greater soil water stress can cause lower grain yield in these conditions. However, more frequent EOFI using 10 day intervals has produced very similar results with only a marginal reduction in crop yield. Furthermore, there was no statistically significant difference in grain yield between fixed and variable every-other -furrow irrigations. In general, at given applied water, the relative grain yield with respect to the maximum grain yield of sorghum at EOFI was higher than those at EFI. At relative applied water of 85 % (mild deficit irrigation), EOFI may be recommended to obtain the same grain yield as that of EFI with full irrigation. Furthermore, it may result in 23 % more grain yield than that obtained by EFI with the same amount of applied water as deficit irrigation...|$|R

40|$|A {{research}} was conducted during growing season of 2005 to {{study the effects of}} irrigation regimes and row arrangement on yield, yield components and seed quality, oil percentage, germination index, germination percentage and seedling growth parameters and vigority of pumpkin (Cucurbita pepo L.). Three irrigation intervals of 7, 14 and 21 days and different plant spacing of 100 x 20, 100 x 40, 200 x 20 and 200 x 40 cm were used. Results indicated that the highest seed yield of pumpkin was observed in <b>irrigation</b> <b>interval</b> of 7 days, {{but it was not a}} significant difference between 7 and 14 days irrigation intervals. Irrigation intervals have a significant effect on number of seeds per fruit and the highest amount was observed in irrigation intervals of 7 days. Increasing <b>irrigation</b> <b>interval</b> up to 21 days decreased significantly the number of seeds per fruit and consequently seed yield per unit area. The highest seed oil yield was observed in <b>irrigation</b> <b>interval</b> of 7 days. Irrigation intervals had not significant effects on germination index and germination percentage of pumpkin but significantly affect lengths and wet weights of primary root and hypocotyls and vigority in pumpkin seeds. Results showed that the highest seed yield of pumpkin was obtained in 100 cm row distances in compare to 200 cm. Row distance had not a significant effect on number of seeds per fruit, but the highest fruits number was observed in lower row distances. Germination index and germination percentage were not affected by row distances but the highest root and hypocotyl lengths and wet weights and also seed vigority were observed in higher distances. Between row distances did not have a significant effect on evaluated parameters. The most favorable interaction treatment for seed yield and seed oil yield of pumpkin was <b>irrigation</b> <b>interval</b> of 7 days and plant spacing of 100 x 40 cm (25000 plants ha - 1) ...|$|E
40|$|Borage is a {{valuable}} medicinal plant with various constituents in leaves, flowers and seeds. Hence, {{it is important to}} improve the performance of this medicinal plant under different environmental conditions. Thus, two field experiments were arranged as split-plots based on a RCB design with three replications in 2012 and 2013, to evaluate the effects of seed priming and different <b>irrigation</b> <b>intervals</b> on selected physiological properties of borage leaves. <b>Irrigation</b> <b>intervals</b> (<b>irrigation</b> after 60, 90, 120, 150 mm evaporation from Class A pans, respectively) and priming treatments (control, water, KNO 3 and KH 2 PO 4) were allocated to the main and sub plots, respectively. The chlorophyll content index was enhanced under limited irrigation treatments, mainly due to a decrease in leaf area index and intercepting more radiation. However, the membrane stability index was stable under different <b>irrigation</b> <b>intervals.</b> Decreased relative water content and leaf area index and increased leaf temperature under lower water availability led to some reductions in the grain yield of borage. All of the priming techniques, particularly hydro-priming, enhanced the seedling emergence rate, leaf area index and consequently grain yield per unit area. Therefore, seed hydro-priming can be used to improve the field performance of borage, particularly when sufficient water is available...|$|R
