40|$|Purpose The {{construction}} {{industry is a}} labor-intensive industry, hence, the presence of labor with high productivity at each stage of the project {{plays a significant role}} in achieving project success. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to provide real-life empirical data about the current level of construction productivity, in this case <b>electrical</b> <b>installation</b> <b>work,</b> within construction projects in Norway. In addition, it was of interest to identify the areas which have the highest potential for improvement of labor productivity. Design/methodology/approach This study considers the construction labor productivity through an elaboration on productive vs unproductive time within construction projects. It is based on a “frequency study” done on eight construction projects in Norway. The “work sampling” method has been used for collection of empirical data. For each project, four electricians were observed an entire working day and the amount of time they spent on performing each activity was recorded every 60 th seconds. The activities observed were based on a predefined set of activities. Findings The results of the observations show that on average, 61. 1 percent of the time was direct value-added work. This number is significantly better than what is normally discussed as being productive time. However, the findings also show that there is still potential for improvement. The activities that have the highest potential for improvement include “material transfer,” “amendments to already executed installation,” “personal needs” and “waiting times. ” Practical implications The study results will be of immense benefit to managers of construction projects as well as managers of construction organizations in enhancing their project performance and productivity. Originality/value This paper contributes both theoretically and empirically to the current discussion and findings on labor productivity and its relation to project success. The results presented in this paper have important implications of labor productivity in construction projects and future studies in the area of project performance...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a control strategy for a three- phase four-wire shunt active filter. The shunt active filter is a custom-power device capable to compensate, in real time, harmonics, unbalances and power factor in an <b>electrical</b> <b>installation.</b> In this <b>work</b> the power circuit {{is based on}} a three-leg IGBT inverter, with the dc-link composed by two capacitors connected in split. Thus the neutral point is connected directly to the midpoint of the dc-link capacitors. Its control system is composed by an algorithm based on the active and non-active currents together with a synchronizing circuit, and a novel algorithm to keep the voltages of the dc-link capacitors balanced and regulated. Due to the applied power-inverter topology, it is imperative to keep these voltages of the dc-link capacitors balanced in order to avoid malfunctioning of the active filter. To validate the proposed control strategy, simulation and experimental results are presented...|$|R

40|$|In an <b>electrical</b> <b>installation</b> at the <b>work</b> {{location}} de-energizing is {{only one}} part of creating an electrically safe work condition {{for the duration of the}} work. Unexpected sources can occur, specially when working on overhead lines. Some activities are sensitive to the unexpected sources and in these cases, depending on the electrical energy available, these sources could cause injury or death. The paper relates about an fatal injury occurred working on a de-energized overhead line. Generally there is uncertainty about exposure to the unexpected sources. When there is suspect on the electrical energy not negligible, it is wise to add temporary protective measures. Many times, it is a decision made in the field and entrusted to the person performing the work. An essential progress of the safety procedures should be to set concrete guiding criteria at the standard level for detecting by conventional tests at least the steady unexpected sources. This integrative rule could be added to the canonical requirements of de-energized work like last one in order of execution. Consequently in the cases of sensitive works this integrative rule could help for decision making on choosing temporary protective measures additional to the dead working procedure or on adopting the live working procedure. © IEEE 2010...|$|R
