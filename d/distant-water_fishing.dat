40|$|The {{growth of}} <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> {{industry}} in Taiwan has been steady {{during the period}} from 1965 - 1973. However, since 1973, the slow expansion of distant-water fisheries has been reflected in both the production side and the decreasing catch per unit effort. The increasing operation costs and the shrinking fishing grounds are mainly attributable to the limitation of <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> industry. The small scale of fishing companies with small-sized vessels also resulted in the inefficient operation in this highly competitive business. For Taiwan, <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> is not only a means of meeting general protein requirements for its population but also an important source of foreign exchange. As such, the government has planned to double its annual distant-water fish catch to 700, 000 MT in six years through an aggressive promotion program...|$|E

5000|$|However, under Saouma's {{leadership}} FAO lost {{a substantial}} share {{of support from}} the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) and from several industrial nations. This was caused by Saouma's withdrawing FAO Country Representatives from UNDP offices the world over and establishing separate FAO offices; UNDP reacted by executing its own agriculture projects, instead of financing their execution by FAO. Saouma also allowed FAO Fisheries Department to focus efforts and publicity on promoting and supporting the 200-mile [...] "exclusive economic zones" [...] of coastal nations. This led to exclusion or increasing the operational costs of major <b>distant-waters</b> <b>fishing</b> fleets that as a rule belonged to industrial nations and major FAO donors. The consequence was substantial reduction of donor-financed FAO fisheries projects. Finally, Saouma considerably increased the number of professional staff from developing countries at the expense of professionals from developed ones, which resulted in certain decline in FAO's general level of experience and expertise.|$|R
40|$|The South Pacific {{albacore}} tuna (Thunnus alalunga) fishery {{is one of}} the region's oldest commercial fisheries. Fleets from major <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> nations (DWFNs) deploy long-line, troll and drift-net vessels in the fishery. While addressing issues of biology and distribution of stocks, the article traces the development of the albacore fishery leading to the controversy surrounding the deployment of drift-net fleets in the region. Regional and international attempts to ban drift-net fishing in the South Pacific and to develop a management regime for albacore are outlined. The paper also considers the two draft proposals for the management regime tabled by Japan and South Pacific countries and territories as well the status of negotiations for the conclusion of a regime. ...|$|E

Through the adjusted measures, it has successfully achieved increases in her fisheries production in recent years. The purpose of this study is to examine the problems that have occurred or may occur to the Taiwan ROC fisheries industry as a consequence of the establishment of national EEZs.

We use the western and central Pacific fishery to highlight the types of science functions and attributes required for effective regional fishery management. In establishing science arrangements, nations will need to balance national interests, such as participation in stock assessments, against the wider interests of resource management which requires unbiased scientific advice.

40|$|The {{widespread}} {{implementation of}} Extended Fisheries Jurisdiction (EFJ) has confronted coastal states with several resource management problems.

Several of the other papers presented here deal with specific aspects of the issue. This paper, on the other hand, will concern itself {{with the question of}} the analytical framework to be used by economists in studying this issue. It will offer some suggestions with respect to possible components of the framework. In doing so, the paper will restrict itself to the coastal state's perspective of EFJ and the management issues arising therefrom.

40|$|Vessel {{monitoring}} systems (VMS) are considered important instruments for fisheries monitoring, control and surveillance (MCS) {{to reverse the}} current depressed state of the world's fisheries, and have been mandated worldwide by fishery management agencies. The essential function {{of the system is}} to provide near-real time vessel position; the potential applications could, however, be more than that. This study explores the additional benefits, with practical examples, that Taiwan has received from implementing the system: in improving {{the quantity and quality of}} logbooks recovered, obtaining access to fishery-independent fishing effort estimates and prompt catch/effort reporting, enabling the possibility of regional management and understanding of both fleet dynamics and vessel behavior, and increasing efficiency of vessel safety protection. For other <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> nations, Taiwan's experiences serve to demonstrate how the application of VMS technology can advance sustainable fisheries management.

40|$|A {{major source}} of {{controversy}} in the protracted Rules of Origin negotiations at the World Trade Organization is the origin to be ascribed to fish taken from the exclusive economic zone. Participants' positions are polarised between views recalling the old great divide between coastal States and <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> States, one camp seemingly oblivious to the past 50 years' developments in international fisheries law, the other adhering rigidly to a position elevating origin {{to the status of}} one of the coastal State's sovereign rights, even though practical considerations make such a rule unworkable. It is concluded that the rules of origin issue does not lend itself to use as a proxy vehicle for advancing legal and policy interests in international fisheries, and a compromise solution is offered that may enhance international fisheries commissions' authority in managing their species. Some problematic aspects of the much less controversial origin rules on minerals recovered from the deep seabed are also considered...|$|E
40|$|The Western Indian Ocean (WIO) {{is one of}} {{the largest}} fishing areas among those {{classified}} as such by The Food and Agricultural Organization of the United Nations (FAO). The region has maintained a steady rate of increase in fish landings mainly as a result of increased harvests of tuna species by <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> states since the 1990 s. The highly migratory nature of the tuna stocks calls for management cooperation among coastal states in the WIO, taking into account principles and provisions in recent international instruments. This chapter reviews the broad organizational framework in the WIO with regard to tuna fisheries management, and particularly, the Indian Ocean Tuna Commission (IOTC). We examine the challenges faced by the IOTC in the management and conservation of tuna, and the measures being taken to implement international fishery instruments, with a view to enhancing the coordination and cooperation of WIO coastal states at a regional level...|$|E
40|$|The Japanese fishing {{industry}} in general, and the distant-water fleet in particular, {{is undergoing a}} period of transformation in response to several constraints on its traditional modes of operation. The emergence of these constraints in the last 20 years has had a marked impact on the operation of distant-water fisheries and encouraged considerable structural change in the Japanese {{fishing industry}}. This paper examines issues facing Japan's long-distance tuna fishing industry, particularly the significant legal, political and economic constraints facing the industry. The paper argues that, notwithstanding {{the significance of the}} advent of 200 -mile zones arising from the LOS Convention, the problem of restricted access to distant-water grounds is not as important in the medium term as the economic constraints on Japan's <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> industry. While it is clear that Japan is already adopting a number of strategies to cope with these legal, political and economic issues, the paper concludes that the long-term outlook for the distant-water tuna fishing industry in its current form is bleak. ...|$|E
40|$|With {{the advent}} of {{extended}} maritime jurisdictions, new arrangements will be sought between fisheries resource owners and <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> fleets that may want to share the use of fishery resources. Each party has motives for wanting to exploit the fishery, and each has strengths and weaknesses in doing so. The {{purpose of this study}} was to develop a logical process to identify arrangements that are fair and profitable for both parties. As a case study, we examined conflicts and agreements of interest between Indonesia and Japan with respect to arrangements they might have for exploiting Indonesia's tuna. Thirty-seven possible arrangements between the two countries were evaluated by a multinational, multidisciplinary team employing goal analysis, an optimization technique for dealing with multiple objectives. The arrangements differed in the following respects: type of fishing operation (all of them longline, but differing with respect to vessel size and other characteristics); kind of processing (cold storage, canning, or freezer-carrier operations); ownership (Indonesian, joint-venture, or Japanese); base of operation (Indonesia or Japan); participating Japanese sector (small-scale tuna fishermen, medium-scale tuna fishermen, or traders and large-scale fishery companies) ...|$|E

Its significance to theconservation of the worldÃÂ¿s last remaining healthy tuna stocks cannot be underestimated. It also represents a paradigm shift in the way in which Pacific Island States have oftenviewed their tuna resources. For a long time, the major beneficiaries from their tuna stockshave been vessels from <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> nations (DWFNs). The change from capacitylimits to effort controls was not without resistance. DWFNs did not want to see effort controlsreplace capacity limits, which they believed rightfully belonged to them.

The article also examines some of the issuesthat could potentially have an impact on the implementation of the scheme.

40|$|International {{fisheries}} law is {{no longer}} driven by the clash of interests between coastal and <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> States, but is increasingly about how States in existing international fisheries, mostly {{with some degree of}} responsibility for their depletion, are striving to exclude newcomers. The residual freedom of fishing on the high seas is an obstacle to regulation by international commissions since States outside are not bound by treaties to which they are not party—which in turn creates a disincentive for States inside to accept the necessary restraints. Rules to limit entry to international fisheries are therefore now needed, and articles 8 and 17 of the UN Fish Stocks Agreement come close to this, but their transformation into custom (or that of regulations adopted by fisheries commissions into objective regimes) so as to bind non-parties is being stunted by commissions' self-serving views on what cooperation with them by new entrants to the fisheries entails for the latter. The result is that the modern arguments for exclusion of newcomers bear an uncomfortable resemblance to the discredited 1950 s abstention doctrine. This article suggests why those arguments are now meeting little resistance, despite being advanced by States collectively unwilling even to restore depleted stocks to the biomass corresponding to their maximum sustainable yield, as the doctrine would have required (and the current law also does...|$|E
40|$|As {{a result}} of the poor state of High Seas {{resources}} and the international dimension of conflicts between coastal States and <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> nations, the management of High Seas resources has acquired the status of a severe problem in the last decade. In spite of the efforts made by UNCLOS (United Nations Convention on Law of the Sea) and the 1995 Fish Stocks Agreement with regards to regulating all activities that are developed in the sea, there are still important problems with respect to the legal regulation of fishing on the High Seas that are not well covered by it, and the conservation of shared or straddling stocks is the most important issue to be resolved. In the Patagonian Large Marine Ecosystem the need to explore the importance of transboundary resource management is supported by {{the fact that many of}} the commercial resources exploited at the 200 -mile limit are shared resources, such as the Argentine short-fin squid, the common squid, the Argentine hake, the southern blue whiting and the Patagonian toothfish. This is a critical issue in international fisheries management because of these resources are exploited by the distant-water fleets ’ activity in the adjacent zone of the Argentinean Economic Exclusive Zone and Malvinas/Falkland Islands conservation zones. However, little research has been done on economic perspective of straddling stocks in the region. Therefore, this paper present...|$|E
40|$|In recent decades, <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> vessels (DWFVs) {{have drawn}} {{increasing}} criticism for exacerbating misery in developing nations. As {{part of a}} resolution to this issue, a coalition of academics, fishers, processors and others developing nations are field-testing new technologies to extend the fishing power and reach of local small-to-medium-boat artisanal fishers to empower them to displace DWFVs. In the preliminary field trials, the technology raised the fishing power of small-vessels by over seven-fold and quadrupled their maximum-effective-fishing depth to 400 meters. The second testing round will occur in Spring 2016 and will seek {{to increase the number}} of tests (and parallel controls) from ten-fold and expand the maximum effective fishing depth to 1, 600 meters. Such capabilities will strengthen the ability of the governments of coastal developing countries to either exclude DWFVs from their exclusive economic zones (EEZs) or negotiate and enforce better agreements. Recognizing that new technology outcomes are often a mixed blessing, a vital part of this endeavor is to establish the best approach to release and use the innovations. Thus, at this point, the coalition is unwilling to release details on the new technologies. Instead, this paper documents the project’s intent, its field-test design/methodology, results and a vision for how its innovations might best be introduced to developing-nation fishers. This article should interest fisheries policy makers, processors, academics, artisanal fishers and diplomats...|$|E

The country's decision coincides with an initiative taken at a UN fisheries meeting to address fleet overcapacity, {{one of the most}} important factors contributing to overfishing. However, governments failed to finish their work and give themselves a firm deadline to reduce fleet overcapacity, according to the World Wide Fund for Nature (WWF). Key provisions of a draft action plan on overcapacity were agreed by about 80 member countries at the conclusion of their meeting at FAO's headquarters, at the end of last year. The draft action plan commits FAO member nations to develop national plans to address fleet capacity and begin to control the size of <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> fleets.

40|$|The Russian Barents Sea {{represents}} a celebrated example of sustainable fisheries management owing to effective and stable bilateral cooperation between Norway and Russia. The {{success of the}} state regime has not ruled out the emergence of private certification of the Marine Stewardship Council (MSC). The current study investigates the intended and unintended implications of the emergence and implementation of MSC certification in the Russian Barents Sea region. The employed conceptual framework builds on the literature on private informational governance, more specifically by providing an analytical prism of three core concepts: transparency, participation and trust. Based on interviews with stakeholders closely involved in MSC certification in Russia and literature analysis, this study concludes that MSC performs primarily a supplementary commercial function for Russian Barents Sea fisheries, which are already generally considered as sustainable, by ensuring access to the world market of sustainable fish and potentially providing a premium price. The certification mechanism has little {{to add to the}} well-established practices at sea, but it does urge companies to prioritise attention to such environmental issues as bycatch, discards and negative effects of bottom trawling through encouraging cooperation between fishing companies, NGOs and research institutions. Our analysis also suggests that indirectly MSC certification contributes to a growing divide between larger-scale, internationally oriented, <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> companies and the smaller-scale coastal fisheries dependent on state support. Finally, our analysis draws attention to the distrust of the Russian state in transnational private governance arrangements, like MSC, the implications of which are currently unclear...|$|E
40|$|Research PaperThis paper {{begins by}} {{outlining}} {{the history of}} the Rules of Origin negotiations in the World Trade Organization (WTO), unfinished business from the Uruguay Round that is separate from the current Doha Round. The treatment of products of the sea is one {{of a large number of}} unresolved issues; progress on settling these has been so slow that the goal of an agreement harmonizing rules of origin may never be reached. After sketching the treatment of uncontentious parts of the text on fish, the paper turns to the focus of controversy for the last several years: the origin to be ascribed to fish taken from the exclusive economic zone (EEZ). Participants' positions are polarized between two views recalling the great divide between coastal States and <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> States before the EEZ’s advent in the 1970 s. To an extent no longer seen in debates within international fisheries commissions, one camp is seemingly oblivious to the developments of the past 50 years in international fisheries law, while the other adheres rigidly to a position elevating origin to the status of one of the coastal State’s sovereign rights over resources in the EEZ, even though practical considerations make such a purist rule unworkable. While the basic conclusion is that the rules of origin issue does not lend itself to use as a proxy vehicle for advancing legal and policy interests in relation to international fisheries, a compromise solution is offered that may enhance the authority of international fisheries commissions in managing their species...|$|E
40|$|Graduation date: 1998 This {{dissertation}} contains {{theoretical and}} empirical analyses on common property fisheries resources. The theoretical analysis focuses on a highly migratory fish stocks (HMFS) fishery, and examines the inefficiency caused by non-cooperative harvest. The empirical analysis focuses on a high seas fishery and conducts an empirical test {{on the effects of}} the current and future number of harvesters on equilibrium harvest and resource rents. In the theoretical analysis, a two period, non-cooperative, game-theoretic model is developed for an WvIFS fishery. In each period, the fish stock migrate from the exclusive economic zone (EEZ) of a coastal state into the high seas, where <b>distant-water</b> <b>fishing</b> (DWF) harvesters may harvest them. It is shown that having an EEZ improves total welfare by reducing total harvest and the degree of the welfare improvement increases when the number of harvesters in an HMFS fishery increases. It is also shown that new entrants to an HMFS fishery lead to a larger harvest and rent dissipation. With open- Redacted for Privacy access in the second stage, resource rent is totally dissipated for DWF harvesters but not for the coastal state harvesters, which still earn positive rent. In the empirical analysis, a dynamic Cournot model is used to predict the strategic behavior of harvesters engaged in a non-cooperative fishery on a common property resource. The model predicts that an increase in the current number of harvesters in a common property fishery will increase the collective equilibrium harvest level, but will reduce both the equilibrium harvest level and the current resource rent for the individual harvester. Also, an increase in the future number of harvesters increases all three equilibrium levels. These predictions are tested using data from the Japanese trawl fishery in the Bering Sea Donut Hole. The empirical results on the effect of changes in the current and future numbers of harvesters on the collective and individual harvest rates and resource rents are consistent with theory...|$|E
40|$|Several species {{targeted}} by global fisheries have suffered declines {{due to increased}} fishing efforts and more sophisticated fishing technology since the late 1980 s. The Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO) of the United Nations estimates that 30 % of global tuna stocks are overexploited or depleted and that 53 % are fully exploited. In the Pacific Ocean, {{one of the last}} global refuges of healthy tuna stocks remains. More than 70 % of the tuna consumed globally is caught here – and for decades, stocks of tuna have seemed inexhaustible. However, certain stocks are under pressure from fishing practices ranging from sustainable and well- governed ones, to fishing methods that are ecologically and ethically harmful, unsustainable and at times illegal. Determining whether a fishery is operating on sustainable terms is challenging. The ability to include multiple variables in assessing the sustainability of a fishery system represents a new school of thought within fisheries sciences. Key challenges in fisheries management today involve issues of overcapacity, perverse subsidies, perverse economics, poor governance, lack of data, climate change, unemployment or the issues of by-catch and discards. The challenges are interlinked and undermine the possibility of achieving sustainability if a holistic, ecosystem-based management is not implemented. This research has attempted a sustainability assessment of the skipjack and yellowfin tuna fisheries of the Western-Central Pacific Ocean (WCPO), with focus on the fishing methods purse-seine (PS) and pole-and-line (PNL). It illuminated the fishery through a case study of a fishing company in Solomon Islands, with qualitative data collected through semi-structured interviews of fishers and key informants from tuna management agencies performed in Suva, Fiji, Honiara and Noro, Solomon Islands, in April-May 2015. The qualitative data was analysed in a semi-quantitative manner, combined with secondary literature and document analysis using Elinor Ostrom’s Social-Ecological Systems (SES) framework as an analytical tool. The key results of the analysis suggest that the yellowfin tuna stocks of the WCPO are showing slight signs of growth overfishing. It suggests that skipjack stocks in the same area are currently not under overfishing threats, however, their future sustainability will depend on improved policies and implementing more conservational efforts in the stock management. These findings were corroborated by local fishers, who confirmed that current tuna stocks have changed during the past three decades, and that declines of fish stocks have been noticed. In particular, the fishing pressure from <b>Distant-Water</b> <b>Fishing</b> Nations (DWFNs) and increased issuing of fishing licence to PS fishing vessels, were worrying to these informants. This study concludes that ensuring sustainability in the WCPO could be enhanced by decreasing PS vessels fishing with FADs, and providing benefits to PS fishers shifting to free school fishing. It would seem beneficial to encourage a partial shift to more PNL vessels, as this fishing method secures biological, socioeconomic and employment sustainability. The sustainability issues of the bait fishery are recognized, and further research towards improved management would be advisable to ensure healthy stocks. Finally, the current momentum of Pacific regionalism through the strengthening of the Pacific Islands’ solidarity and cooperation are recognised as key factors contributing to social and ecological sustainability, and towards securing their wealth derived from tuna resources.
