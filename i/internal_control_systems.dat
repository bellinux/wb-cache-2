40|$|Purpose – First, {{this paper}} aims to provide {{empirical}} {{evidence of the}} interaction between the components of an <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Second, it seeks to integrate work from the field of strategy and that on the <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> from the field of auditing. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to enable a more profound understanding of how different strategic orientations may influence effectiveness, depending on the components of the <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Design/methodology/approach – Data were collected through an online questionnaire and analyzed using multiple regression analysis, i. e. a three-way interaction model. The result was a usable sample of the opinions of 741 managers working in Finland. Findings – The results indicate that, for prospector firms, high degrees of <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> activity and low degrees of monitoring ensure a greater effectiveness of the <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> On the other hand, for analyzers a high degree of <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> activity and high degrees of monitoring lead to a highly effective <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> In addition, our findings indicate no significant differences between defenders and analyzers. Research limitations/implications – The research is limited to only two components of the <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system,</b> namely, <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> activities and monitoring. Future research is needed to examine the interactions of other components of the <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system.</b> Practical implications – The paper demonstrates the need for managers to be aware of the drivers of the effectiveness of the <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and the relationships essential to drive effectiveness, especially when operating in different strategic fields. While all components of an <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> are vital, this study shows that a good fit between them can lead to improved effectiveness. Originality/value – This is the first empirical study that has used a three-way interaction method to study <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> structures and their effectiveness in an organizational context. Coupled with previous work, it suggests the need for both researchers and practitioners to examine the interactions of an <b>internal</b> <b>control</b> <b>system</b> and how they impact on the effectiveness of that <b>system.</b> Auditing, Finland, <b>Internal</b> <b>control,</b> Management effectiveness, Management strategy...|$|R
