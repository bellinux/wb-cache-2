5|$|Rassa Railroad: a tramway {{built in}} 1794 {{to connect the}} Sirhowy <b>Ironworks</b> to the Beaufort <b>Ironworks,</b> and {{connected}} them to several limestone quarries at Trevil.|$|E
5|$|During the Civil War, Troy's {{industries}} {{played a}} key role in supporting the Union cause. The Burden <b>Ironworks</b> is said to have supplied all the Union Army's horseshoes, and another local <b>ironworks</b> supplied the USS Monitors hull plating. Its owners would later produce the first Bessemer process steel in the United States after the war.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} {{generally accepted}} incarnation of West Ham United {{was founded in}} 1895 as the Thames <b>Ironworks</b> team by foreman and local league referee Dave Taylor and owner Arnold Hills and was announced in the Thames <b>Ironworks</b> Gazette of June 1895.|$|E
5|$|The {{firm was}} founded at Newcastle-upon-Tyne with an <b>ironworks</b> and an alkali works nearby at Walker. The alkali works {{was the first}} in England to make Soda using the Leblanc process; the <b>ironworks</b> was the first to use Cleveland Ironstone, presaging the 1850s boom in {{ironmaking}} on Teesside.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} colours of {{the team}} were dark blue, due to Thames <b>Ironworks</b> chairman Arnold Hills being {{a former student of}} Oxford University. However, the team used a variety of kits including the claret and sky blue house colours of Thames <b>Ironworks,</b> as well as sky blue or white kit.|$|E
5|$|He {{returned}} to Sweden in 1768, {{a wealthy man}} and lived {{the rest of his}} life in Swedish high society, writing minor essays about his travels as member of the Royal Swedish Academies of Sciences and Music. He married Lovisa Ulrika Lüning and bought the Godegård Manor and several <b>ironworks,</b> which he renovated and improved. When Grill died in 1792, his wife took over his business and ran the <b>ironworks</b> and factories.|$|E
5|$|Iron ore {{quarrying}} {{was a major}} {{industry in}} and around Wellingborough from the 1860s until the 1960s. James Rixon and Wiliam Ashwell opened a major <b>ironworks</b> {{on the north side}} of the town in 1870, supplied by the extensive ironstone quarries around Finedon to the east of the town. Three narrow gauge tramways served the iron ore industry, the Wellingborough Tramway, Neilson's Tramway and the Finedonhill Tramway. The Wellingborough Tramway served Rixon's <b>ironworks</b> until 1966.|$|E
5|$|Losh, Wilson & Bell's first <b>ironworks</b> {{was founded}} in 1809 at Walker, beside the alkali works, {{carrying}} out a mixture of engineering work but not building steam engines. By 1818, George Stephenson's original wooden wagonway was completely relaid with cast-iron edge-rails made in collaboration between Stephenson, who owned the patent, and Losh, Wilson and Bell. Around 1821, George Stephenson was briefly {{a partner in the}} Walker <b>Ironworks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Thames <b>Ironworks,</b> {{and later}} West Ham United, {{retained}} the claret yoke/blue sleeves design, but also {{continued to use}} their previously favoured colours for their away kits.|$|E
5|$|The Irons {{permanently}} adopted claret {{and blue}} for home colours {{in the summer}} of 1899. Thames <b>Ironworks</b> right-half Charlie Dove received the Aston Villa kit from his father William Dove, who was a professional sprinter of national repute, as well as being involved with the coaching at Thames <b>Ironworks.</b> Bill Dove had been at a fair in Birmingham, close to Villa Park, the home ground of Aston Villa and was challenged to a race against four Villa players, who wagered money that one of them would win.|$|E
5|$|Aside from renovating the {{factories}} in Godegård (the largest <b>ironworks</b> in Östergötland) {{he also had}} an English park planned and built at his manor in Godergård. The park had an orangery, canals, bridges and pavilions and was modelled after the larger park at Drottningholm Palace with its Chinese Pavilion. The Godegård estate also included Mariedamm with the Trehörnings blast furnace and the De Geersfors manufacturing house. Grill also bought the Bona estate in Västra Ny, where he built a wrought iron factory and the Medevi seat farm in 1779, (sold the following year). In 1782, he bought the Flerohopp <b>ironworks.</b>|$|E
5|$|The highest {{attendance}} figure {{recorded at}} <b>Ironworks</b> Road {{came when the}} team played Mansfield Town in the FA Cup first round in the 1967–68 season {{in front of a}} crowd of 5,500 people.|$|E
5|$|The {{team and}} {{supporters}} {{are known as}} The Hammers, {{in part because of}} the club's origins as Thames <b>Ironworks.</b> They are also known as The Irons and The Cockney Boys. Other nicknames are The Academy of Football, or just The Academy.|$|E
5|$|Black Prince {{was laid}} down on 3 June 1903 at the Thames <b>Ironworks</b> and Shipbuilding Company's {{shipyard}} at Blackwall, London. She was launched on 8 November 1904 and completed on 17 March 1906. When completed, Black Prince {{served with the}} 2nd Squadron until 1907, the 1st Cruiser Squadron from 1907–1908, the 5th Cruiser Squadron (as part of the Atlantic Fleet) from 1908–1912 and the Third from 1912–1913.|$|E
5|$|Born {{into a large}} family, Parry {{left school}} {{to work in the}} local coal mines when he was nine years of age. He then went to work at the Cyfarthfa <b>Ironworks,</b> where his father was also employed. In 1854 the family emigrated to the United States, {{settling}} at Danville, Pennsylvania, where Parry again found employment at an iron works.|$|E
5|$|Bulmer's Gazetteer of 1890 {{records that}} in 1888 Bolckow, Vaughan owned 6 of the 36 {{ironstone}} mines in Cleveland and Whitby; the ironstone in their mine at Eston contained 33.62% Iron. By 1887 the company owned 4 of the 21 <b>ironworks</b> in Cleveland, with 21 of the 91 blast furnaces.|$|E
5|$|Coal was {{transported by}} canal and a railway {{connection}} to the Lancashire and Yorkshire Railway's Beswick branch built in the early 1900s, {{but most of it}} was used locally, transported by road using horse and carts and motor lorries, much of it destined for the adjacent Bradford <b>Ironworks.</b> The company bought a 0-4-0 saddle tank locomotive, Bradford, from the Avonside Engine Company of Bristol in 1928 to shunt wagons to the colliery siding.|$|E
5|$|During Roman Britain, {{iron ore}} was mined in the Weald and transported to Ashford where two <b>ironworks</b> {{processed}} the ore into a workable metal. Archaeological studies have revealed {{the existence of}} a Roman town {{to the north of the}} current centre, roughly at the junction of Albert Road and Wall Road.|$|E
5|$|HMS Cyclops {{was laid}} down on 10 September 1870 by the Thames <b>Ironworks</b> in London. She was {{launched}} on 18 July 1871 and commissioned in January 1872. The ship was towed to Devenport that same month for what {{proved to be}} a very lengthy fitting out period that was not completed until 4 May 1877. Cyclops cost £156,782 to build.|$|E
5|$|In 1846, Bolckow and Vaughan {{built their}} first blast {{furnaces}} at Witton Park, founding the Witton Park <b>Ironworks.</b> The works used coal from Witton Park Colliery to make coke, and ironstone from Whitby on the coast. The pig iron produced at Witton was transported to Middlesbrough for further forging or casting.|$|E
5|$|The {{football}} team followed by many East End people is West Ham United, founded in 1895 as Thames <b>Ironworks.</b> The 'other' East London clubs are Leyton Orient, {{and to a}} lesser extent Dagenham and Redbridge, but rather than rivalry, there is some overlap of support. Millwall F.C. originally played in the area of that name on the Isle of Dogs, but moved south of the Thames in 1910.|$|E
5|$|According to the church's caretaker, Brenda Hiett, the church's {{roof and}} siding were {{installed}} around 1900. A wrought iron fence, made by Stewart Iron Works in Cincinnati, Ohio, was installed around the church's cemetery. Electrical conduits {{were added to}} the interior of the church when it was electrified around 1930, and further electrical updates were made in 2011. The church's perimeter foundation of concrete blocks replaced the original stone piers in the early 1970s, and its wide, heart pine plank floors were sanded and re-lacquered. Around 1990, the Stewart Iron Works fence and gate were restored by White’s Ornamental <b>Ironworks.</b>|$|E
5|$|Although the Industrial Revolution did {{not much}} affect the rural parts of Clwyd, there was {{considerable}} industrial activity in the North Wales Coalfield in the north-east of the county, particularly around Wrexham. The Bersham <b>Ironworks</b> at Bersham, in the same area, was {{at the forefront of}} technological advances and was most famous for being the original working site of the industrialist John Wilkinson who invented new processes for boring cannons. The Williams-Wynn family of Wynnstay had become rich after the dissolution of the monasteries and owned vast estates in Clwyd with resources including lead, tin and copper as well as corn and timber.|$|E
5|$|Capital {{and energy}} of urban enterprisers {{affected}} {{the development of}} mining and metallurgy during the earlier Commonwealth period. There were several hundred hammersmith shops {{at the turn of}} the 17th century. Great <b>ironworks</b> furnaces were built in the first half of that century. Mining and metallurgy of silver, copper and lead had also been developed. Expansion of salt production was taking place in Wieliczka, Bochnia and elsewhere. After about 1700 some of the industrial enterprises were increasingly being taken over by land owners who used serf labor, which led to their neglect and decline in the second half of the 17th century.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{had been}} mined at Bradford {{since at least}} the early 17th century, when the area around the pits was largely rural; it became {{increasingly}} built-up and industrialised as nearby Manchester expanded during the 19th century. Coal was transported from the colliery by canal and railway, but most was consumed locally by the adjacent Bradford <b>Ironworks.</b> In the mid-20th century a 469-yard (420 m) underground tunnel was dug to supply coal directly to the Stuart Street Power Station.|$|E
5|$|DisCo built {{a station}} at Lemington, {{in the western}} {{outskirts}} of the city, to provide electricity for a tram line which ran through their supply area, from the City Centre to Throckley. The station was sited amid the derelict buildings of the Tyne Iron Company's <b>ironworks.</b> They had opened in 1797 and closed in 1886. The works were largely demolished, {{but some of the}} ironworks' buildings and chimneys still stood unused, and the power station was built amongst them. DisCo opened Lemington Power Station in 1903.|$|E
5|$|During {{the late}} 18th century and {{throughout}} most of the 19th, Albany was a center of trade and transportation. It is on {{the north end of the}} navigable Hudson River, was the original eastern terminus of the Erie Canal connecting to the Great Lakes, and was home to some of the earliest railroad systems in the world. Albany's main exports at the time were beer, lumber, published works, and <b>ironworks.</b> Beginning in 1810, Albany was one of the ten most populous cities in the United States, a distinction it held until the 1860 census.|$|E
5|$|Grill {{established}} {{a small scale}} trade monopoly at Godegård in 1775. Before he became owner of the <b>ironworks,</b> the farmers around Godegård had refined the wrought iron from the factory into large quantities of nails using small trip hammers. The nails were sold in Askersund. As a trader Grill would not abide this. First he decreed that the farmers had to buy all their goods at the ironworks' general store. Second, he forbade the farmers and tenant farmers to sell nails to the merchants at Askersund, at that time a center for nail trade. In this way Grill assumed control over all nail trade himself.|$|E
5|$|Grill married Lovisa Ulrika Lüning (1744–1824) in Stockholm in 1772. They had ten children. She was the {{daughter}} of wholesaler Johan Christian Lüning and Margaretha Sabbath. In 1775, Grill sold the manor and the steel factory to Qvist and moved to Godegård where he had bought the manor and the <b>ironworks</b> from the estate of Jean de Geer. In doing so he followed the pattern of other supercargos who made their fortunes abroad during {{a short period of time}} in the East India trade and on their return invested their money in Swedish factories and farms.|$|E
5|$|HMS Minotaur was {{originally}} ordered on 2 September 1861 as HMS Elephant, {{in honour of}} the ship once commanded by Nelson seventy years before, but her name was changed to Minotaur during construction. She was laid down on 12 September 1861 by the Thames <b>Ironworks</b> in Blackwall, London. She was launched on 12 December 1863, commissioned in April 1867 and completed on 1 June 1867. The lengthy delay in completion was due to frequent changes in design details, and experiments with her armament and with her sailing rig. The ship cost a total of £478,855.|$|E
5|$|HMS Valiant {{was laid}} down 1 February 1861 by Westwood, Baillie in Cubitt Town. This company went {{bankrupt}} in November 1861 and was ultimately bought by Thames <b>Ironworks,</b> which delayed the ship's launching until 14 October 1863. In August 1865, after Valiant had been towed to Portsmouth for fitting out, {{the ship was}} inspected by French officers during a port visit by ironclads of the French Navy. Production of the new muzzle-loaded rifles was slow and ships already in commission had priority so Valiant was not commissioned until September 1868, nearly five years after she was launched.|$|E
5|$|Henry Thompson {{was born}} in Stormstown, Centre County, Pennsylvania on March 23, 1837, the son of John Thompson and Lydia Blake Thompson. John Thompson was the manager of an <b>ironworks</b> in Centre County, and later owned a general mercantile {{business}} in Stormstown. Lydia Blake was a Quaker from Kennett Square, Pennsylvania, who was disinherited when she married Thompson, a Presbyterian. John Thompson was politically active and served two terms as county sheriff. He was active in anti-slavery and temperance causes, in both of which his son Henry followed him.|$|E
5|$|Here she {{rejoined the}} {{powerful}} 3rd Fleet in strikes {{at the heart}} of Japan from within its home waters. The fleet set a northerly course on 8 July to approach the Japanese main island, Honshū. Raids took Tokyo by surprise on 10 July, followed by more devastation at the juncture of Honshū and Hokkaidō, the second-largest Japanese island, on 13–14 July. For the first time, naval gunfire destroyed a major installation within the home islands when Missouri joined in a shore bombardment on 15 July that severely damaged the Nihon Steel Co. and the Wanishi <b>Ironworks</b> at Muroran, Hokkaido.|$|E
5|$|In 1875, Edward Windsor Richards {{became the}} General Manager of the Middlesbrough <b>Ironworks.</b> Richards {{was in charge}} of the design and {{construction}} of the new plant at Eston, the Cleveland Steel Works. It had three coke fired haematite blast furnaces. Richards' work helped to improve the Bessemer process for making steel, in the case when the ore is rich in phosphorus, and an alkaline rock (dolomite, limestone or magnesite) is used. This variant is called the Gilchrist-Thomas process, after its inventor Sidney Gilchrist Thomas who persuaded Richards to adopt it.|$|E
5|$|In 1877, Skopje {{was chosen}} as the capital city of the new Kosovo Vilayet, which {{encompassed}} present-day Kosovo, northwestern Macedonia and the Sanjak of Novi Pazar. In 1905, the city had 32,000 inhabitants, making it the largest of the vilayet, although closely followed by Prizren with its 30,000 inhabitants. Of the Skopje Muslim population of the late Ottoman period German linguist Gustav Weigand noted that though most were Albanians regarded as Turks or Ottomans (Osmanli), they spoke Turkish in public and Albanian at home. At the beginning of the 20th century, local economy was focused on dyeing, weaving, tanning, <b>ironworks</b> and wine and flour processing.|$|E
5|$|Prior to the British Industrial Revolution, {{which saw}} a rapid {{economic}} expansion between 1750 and 1850, {{there were signs}} of small-scale industries scattered throughout Wales. These ranged from industries connected to agriculture, such as milling and the manufacture of woollen textiles, through to mining and quarrying. Until the Industrial Revolution, Wales had always been reliant on its agricultural output for its wealth and employment and the earliest industrial businesses were small scale and localised in manner. The emerging industrial period commenced around the development of copper smelting in the Swansea area. With access to local coal deposits and a harbour that could take advantage of Cornwall's copper mines and the copper deposits being extracted from the then-largest copper mine in the world at Parys Mountain on Anglesey, Swansea developed into the world's major centre for non-ferrous metal smelting in the 19th century. The second metal industry to expand in Wales was iron smelting, and iron manufacturing became prevalent in both {{the north and the south}} of the country. In the north of Wales, John Wilkinson's <b>Ironworks</b> at Bersham was a significant industry, while in the south, a second world centre of metallurgy was founded in Merthyr Tydfil, where the four <b>ironworks</b> of Dowlais, Cyfarthfa, Plymouth and Penydarren became the most significant hub of iron manufacture in Wales. In the 1820s, south Wales alone accounted for 40% of all pig iron manufactured in Britain.|$|E
