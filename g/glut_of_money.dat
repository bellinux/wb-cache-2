He had nothing to do from early in the morning till late at night, but to read questions, and resolve them as fast as much-frequented doctors write their prescriptions and recipes, and like them also to receive fees as fast. Fortune was indeed mightily indulgent to the wants she had so suddenly reduced him to, and relieved him as suddenly by these knots of curiosos, who brought him a <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> But one single fair lady, that was one of his very first consulters after his return, and who had received satisfactory answers from him in other points, before he went abroad, proved, so good fortune would have it, worth all the rest of his customers together, as numerous as they were, and as I have accordingly represented them.|$|E

25|$|As {{a result}} of the plague in the countryside, farmers could not take care of crops and the price of grain rose at Constantinople. Justinian had {{expended}} huge amounts <b>of</b> <b>money</b> for wars against the Vandals in the region of Carthage and the Ostrogoths' kingdom in Italy. He had dedicated significant funds to the construction of great churches, such as Hagia Sophia. As the empire tried to fund the projects, the plague caused tax revenues to decline through the massive number of deaths and the disruption of agriculture and trade.

50|$|His tract {{entitled}} Discourses upon Trade, principally {{directed to}} the cases of the interest, coinage, clipping and increase <b>of</b> <b>money,</b> was published anonymously in 1691, and was edited in 1856 by J. R. McCulloch in the Select Collection of Early English Tracts on Commerce printed by the Political Economy Club of London. In this assertion of the free-trade doctrine against the system of prohibitions which had gained strength by the Revolution, North shows that wealth may exist independently of gold or silver, its source being human industry, applied either to the cultivation of the soil or to manufactures. It {{is a mistake to}} suppose that stagnation of trade arises from want of money; it must arise either from a <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> the home market, or from a disturbance of foreign commerce, or from diminished consumption caused by poverty. The export <b>of</b> <b>money</b> in the course of traffic, instead of diminishing, increases the national wealth, trade being only an exchange of superfluities. Nations are related to the world just {{in the same way as}} cities to the state or as families to the city. North emphasizes more than his predecessors the value of the home trade.|$|R

By 1698 there was a <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> copper coinage and an Act was passed to stop the coining for one year; this seems to have had little effect and the proliferation continued.

5000|$|A modern way {{of expressing}} Say's law is that there can never be a general <b>glut.</b> Instead <b>of</b> there being an excess supply (<b>glut</b> or surplus) <b>of</b> goods in general, {{there may be an}} excess supply of one or more goods, but only when {{balanced}} by an excess demand (shortage) of yet other goods. Thus, there may be a <b>glut</b> <b>of</b> labor ("cyclical" [...] unemployment), but this is balanced by an excess demand for produced goods. Modern advocates of Say's law see market forces as working quickly, via price adjustments, to abolish both gluts and shortages. The exception is when governments or other non-market forces prevent price adjustments.|$|R
40|$|AbstractIn adipose cells, insulin induces the {{translocation}} <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 by stimulating their exocytosis from a basal intracellular compartment to {{the plasma}} membrane. Increasing overexpression of a hemagglutinin (HA) epitope-tagged GLUT 4 in rat adipose cells {{results in a}} roughly proportional increase in cell surface HA-GLUT 4 levels in the basal state, accompanied by a marked reduction of the fold HA-GLUT 4 translocation in response to insulin. Using biochemical methods and cotransfection experiments with differently epitope-tagged GLUT 4, we show that overexpression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 {{does not affect the}} intracellular sequestration <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 in the absence of insulin, but rather reduces the relative insulin-stimulated GLUT 4 translocation to the plasma membrane. In contrast, overexpression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 1 does not interfere with the targeting <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 and vice versa. These results suggest that the mechanism involved in the intracellular sequestration <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4 has a high capacity whereas the mechanism for GLUT 4 translocation is readily saturated by overexpression <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4, implicating an active translocation machinery in the exocytosis <b>of</b> <b>GLUT</b> 4...|$|R
