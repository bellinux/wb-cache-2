40|$|New {{micromachining}} techniques now {{provide us}} with the technology to fabricate reflex <b>klystron</b> <b>oscillators</b> with dimensions suitable for operation in the terahertz region of the electromagnetic spectrum. For {{the success of these}} devices, accurate designs are required since the optimization of certain parameters is critical to obtaining useful amounts of ac power. Classical models for device design have long been in existence, but these are no longer valid at terahertz frequencies. For this reason, we have developed a simulation tool, specifically aimed at the design of terahertz frequency reflex klystrons. The tool, based on the Monte Carlo algorithm, includes loss mechanisms and takes into account the main peculiarities expected for device operation at terahertz frequencies. In this study, the tool is used to study the influence of the electron beam aperture angle and cavity dimensions (particularly the grid spacing) on ac power generation. The results demonstrate that aperture angles of less than 10 are necessary for the optimization of output power. It is also found that the power output is highly sensitive to the distance between the grids...|$|R

25|$|The {{floating}} {{drift tube}} klystron {{has a single}} cylindrical chamber containing an electrically isolated central tube.

This type of <b>oscillator</b> <b>klystron</b> has an advantage over the two-cavity klystron on which it is based, in that it needs only one tuning element to effect changes in frequency. The drift tube is electrically insulated from the cavity walls, and DC bias is applied separately. The DC bias on the drift tube may be adjusted to alter the transit time through it, thus allowing some electronic tuning of the oscillating frequency. The amount of tuning in this manner is not large and is normally used for frequency modulation when transmitting.|$|R

This effort focuses on using parallel and distributed processing {{to optimize the}} simulation for large problems. The benefits include increased capacity for memory intensive problems, and improved performance for processor-intensive problems. The MPI library enables the parallel version to be easily ported to massively parallel, SMP, and distributed computers. The philosophy employed here is to spatially decompose the system into computational regions separated by “virtual boundaries”, objects which contain the local data and algorithms to perform the local field solve and particle communication between regions. This implementation reduces {{the impact of the}} parallel extension on the balance of the code. Specific implementation details such as the hiding of communication latency behind local computation will also be discussed, as well as code features and capabilities. 1 GOALS FOR PARALLEL XOOPIC XOOPIC has been successful as a single-processor code, and is able to simulate many interesting devices including relativistic <b>klystron</b> <b>oscillators,</b> electron guns, DC discharges with gas chemistry, plasma display panel cells, and highly relativistic beams in accelerators.

The interferometer consists of a 70 GHz <b>klystron</b> <b>oscillator</b> and a quasi-optical transmission system. The probe beam is expanded so as to fill orthogonal views of the plasma cross section. The optical system has been designed using a Gaussian beam propagation theory and a geometric ray-trancing code. The views are imaged onto a 10 - or 11 -channnel Schottky barrier diode array, which are newly developed in the millimeter-wave region for the present experiment. The detector array consists of beam lead GaAs Schottky barrier diodes bonded to bow-tie antennas or Yagi-Uda antennas. This system has been used to obtain chord-averaged electron density profiles at the central-cell and plug-cell plasmas of the GAMMA 10 tandem mirror. The detector array has also been successfully applied to the Fraunhofer diffraction measurement. The measurement permits a detailed study of k-ω　spectra of long-wavelength waves with a few plasma shots. The observed dispresion relation are in good agreement with those of a drift wave and a flute mode including a Doppler shift due to the EXB rotation velocity.

40|$|Abstract- Significant {{benefits}} would follow from improving the signal {{growth rates of}} certain high-power microwave (HPM) sources, including the relativistic <b>klystron</b> <b>oscillator</b> (RKO). Optimization of the growth rate via analytical and standard numerical techniques is intractable {{because of the high}} dimensionality of the design space and the existence of many local optima. Instead, the growth rate is optimized using a real-valued evolutionary algorithm (EA), which performs mutation, selection, and recombination on a population of candidate design parameters. Practical application of EAs requires the availability of a computationally efficient model of design quality. Two models of the RKO are developed relating the growth rate of the microwave output power to the design parameters. Both models have computationally efficient implementations, and one of them generalizes easily to a novel multi-cavity class of RKO devices, which has significantly better growth rates than standard two-cavity RKOs. Many design optimization problems of interest involve physical constraints. The GENOCOP evolutionary algorithm includes features which support the incorporation of physical constraints in the problem specification through the maintenance of separate search and reference populations, where the latter consists entirely of feasible individuals. It provides “blind ” operators to recombine individuals from the two populations to produce new reference population individuals. However, the use of these blind operators can result in unnecessary modification of the search individual, and domain specific recombination operators can result in improved effectiveness. As with any optimization technique, GENO-COP also allows the use of either the penalty function or repair method for evaluation of infeasible individuals. Computational experiments are performed comparing the effectiveness of each possible combination of these constraint handling techniques. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{discovery}} and subsequent {{understanding of the}} Gunn effect were followed by applications of the improved Gunn devices in practical configurations, the oscillator and amplifier modes receiving most of the attention. This thesis is primarily an experimental investigation {{in the area of}} waveguide Gunn oscillators under conditions of injection locking, bias (FM) modulation or both. These areas had barely been touched upon at the onset of this work and a number of aspects therein needed elucidation. Currently, an increasing interest is developing in the topics of this investigation, especially in modulating Gunn oscillators and in using injection techniques for applications in communication systems. The experimental results were obtained by using waveguide oscillators constructed in the School and employing commercially available devices. These were modulated by superimposing an AC signal on the bias DC voltage and were locked by injecting a signal from a <b>klystron.</b> The <b>oscillator</b> behaviour was examined mainly in the following areas: (i) partial locking, (ii) full locking, (iii) bias modulation, (iv) bias modulation together with injection locking and, (v) phenomena associated with the reflected power from the device. Cases (i) - (iv) above, treated together, provide a coherent view of the reflection behaviour of waveguide Gunn oscillators. The factors which affect the prelock spectral history (i) and their influence on the diode are revealed together with a number of anomalous results. The effect of the locking signal on a two-frequency oscillator is also examined in (i). The study of the fully locked oscillator (ii) shows that net amplification is sometimes possible and, in addition, discusses the oscillator characteristics at lock, its frequency responses and previously unreported instability phenomena. Measurements over a wide range of modulating frequencies and voltages (iii, iv), clarify the effects of these parameters on the modulation and locked-modulation characteristics of the oscillator and produce an empirical law correlating these quantities to the locking power. Also, extensions of locked-modulation work into the case of non-coincident oscillator and locking frequencies show that existing theories do not fully account for the observed behaviour. Through (i) - (iv) asymmetries of results about the free-running oscillator frequency are noted. In (v), a new phenomenon is reported and it is believed that this can find applications in frequency demodulation and in estimating diode parameters. Where appropriate, comparisons are made with theory and the original contributions are placed in the context of other work in the field...|$|R
40|$|The high {{temperature}} of the surface of Venus poses many difficulties. Previous Venus landers have only operated for short durations before succumbing to the heat. NASA Glenn Research Center conducted a study on communications for long duration Venus surface missions. I report the findings in this presentation. Current technology allows production of communications transceivers that can operate {{on the surface of}} Venus, at temperatures above 450 C and pressures of over 90 atmospheres. While these transceivers would have to be relatively simple, without much of the advanced signal processing often used in modern transceivers, since current and near future integrated circuits cannot operate at such {{high temperature}}s, the transceivers will be able to meet the requirements of proposed Venus Surface mission. The communication bands of interest are High Frequency or Very High Frequency (HFNHF) for communication between Venus surface and airborne probes (including surface to surface and air to air), and Ultra High Frequency (UHF) to Microwave bands for communication to orbiters. For HFNHF, transceivers could use existing vacuum tube technology. The packaging of the vacuum tubes may need modification, but the internal operating structure already operates at high temperatures. Using metal vacuum structures instead of glass, allows operation at high pressure. Wide bandgap transistors and diodes may be able to replace some of the thermionic components. VHF communications would be useful for line-of- sight operations, while HF would be useful for short-wave type communications using the Venusian ionosphere. UHF and microwave communications use magnetically focused thermionic devices, such as traveling wave tubes (TWTs), magnetron (M-type) amplifiers, and klystrons for high power amplifiers, and backward wave oscillators (BWOs) and reflex <b>klystrons</b> for <b>oscillators.</b> Permanent magnets are already in use in industry that can operate at 500 C. These magnets could focus electron beam tubes on the surface of Venus. While microwave windows will need to be designed for the high pressure, diamond windows have already been demonstrated, so high-pressure microwave windows can be designed and built. Thus, all of these devices could be useful for Venus surface missions. Current electronic power conditioners to supply the high voltages used in these microwave devices cannot operate at high temperatures, but earlier electronic power conditioners that used vacuum tubes can be modified to work at high temperature. Evaluating the various devices in this study, the M-type traveling wave tube (where a traveling wave structure is used in a crossed-field device, similar to the Amplitron used on the Apollo missions) stood out for the high power amplifier since it requires a single high voltage, simplifying the power supply design. Since the receiver amplifier is a low power amplifier, the loss of efficiency in linear beam devices without a depressed collector (and thus needing a single high voltage) is not important; a low noise TWT is a possible solution. Before solid-state microwave amplifiers were available, such TWTs were built with a 1 - 2 dB noise figure. A microwave triode or transistor made from a wide bandgap material may be preferable, if available. Much of the development work needed for Venusian communication devices will need to focus on the packaging of the devices, and their connections, but the technology is available to build transceivers that can operate on the surface of Venus indefinitely...|$|R
40|$|Paramagnetic {{resonance}} (p. r.) at {{low temperatures}} {{has been investigated}} {{in a number of}} substances in the solid state. Paramagnetic ions in the solid state are subjected to strong crystalline electric fields which profoundly modify the magnetic properties of the free ion. The orbital momentum of the free ion is completely or partially "quenched", leaving the spin momentum unaffected, except to a small extent due to spin-orbit coupling. The ground state consists of a number of levels, generally singlets or doublets. The separations of these levels may be varied by the application of an external magnetic field. If two levels have energies W 1 and W 2 and an external r. f. magnetic field, of frequency v such that h v = W 1 - W 2, is applied, transitions can be excited between the levels, within the limitations of certain selection rules. As the population of the two levels depends upon the Boltzman distribution there is a nett absorption of energy from the r. f. field when transitions occur. If this energy is lost to the crystal lattice quickly enough it is not reradiated. In practice a fixed frequency is chosen and the separation of the energy levels is adjusted by applying an external magnetic field so that the above condition is satisfied. By studying the fields at which the absorption occurs the position of the energy levels in zero field can be inferred. The energies of the levels may be expressed concisely {{in the form of a}} "spin hamiltonlan" which involves a number of parameters which have to be found experimentally. The general spin hamiltonian for an ion in a field of rhombic symmetry is: H = β(g x H x S x + g y H y S y + g z H z S z) + D [S 2 z - 1 ⁄ 3 S(S + 1) ] + E(S 2 x - S 2 y) + A x S x I x + A y S y I y + A z S z I z S is the effective spin chosen so that the multiplicity of the ground state is 2 S + l, β is the Bohr magneton, the g's are spectroscopic splitting factors along the axes of the crystal field. D represents the effect of the axial component of the field along the z axis and E represents the rhombic component of the crystal field. The transitions between the levels defined by these parameters give rise to the so-called fine structure lines. I is the nuclear spin and the terms in A, S and I represent the interaction between the magnetic moments of the electron and of the nucleus. This interaction splits each fine structure line into 2 I + l equally Intense, equally spaced hyperfine lines. Thus the number of hyperfine lines defines the nuclear spin unambiguously. Also the separatlon between the lines proportional to tbe nuclear magnetic moment so that in certain cases this can be estimated. The specimens used have usually consisted of single crystals of a diamagnetic salt containing about 1 % of an isomorphous paramagnetic salt. This dilution separates the paramagnetic ions and reduces tbe line width caused by their mutual interaction. Tbe experimental arrangement is of the standard type used in Oxford. Some refinements of technique have been used for particular experiments which needed them. Experiments have been performed at wavelengths between 10 em and 0. 8 mm. A <b>klystron</b> <b>oscillator,</b> run from a stabilised power pack, feeds power to a half wave resonant cavity which contains tbe sample placed in a position where the r. f. magnetic field is strong. This cavity can be placed in a dewar vessel of refrigerant and between tbe poles of an electromagnet. A wavemeter measures the wavelength and a crystal detector rectifies tbe power coupled out of the resonant cavity. The external field has a small 50 c/s modulation superimposed on it so that an absorption signal is swept through 100 times a second. The signal from the detector may then be amplified in a video-amplifier. If the amplified signal is fed to the Y-plates of an oscilloscope, which has a correctly phased 50 c/s time base, the trace displays a graph of absorption agalnst magnetic field within the region covered by the field modulation. This technique enables a spectrum to be analysed very rapidly. Complex Cyanides The p. r. spectra of two complex cyanides of divalent ions, K 4 V(CN) 6 3 H 2 O and K 4 Mn(CN) 6 3 H 2 O, have been studied. The orbital momentum of the vanadous ion is completely quenched so that it is in an S = 3 / 2 state and its behaviour resembles that of the same ion in ionic crystals. The g-value, 1. 992, is closer to the free spin value and the crystal field parameters, D = - 0. 0264 ± 0. 0004 em - 1 and E = - 0. 0072 ± 0. 0004 cm - 1, are smaller showing that the effect of higher levels is less than in the ionic salts. The hyperfine structure constant A = - 0. 00555 ± 0. 00003 cm - 1 is only 36 % smaller than in the ionic salts, showing that the configurational interaction which produces the hyperfine structure is not greatly modified by the covalent bonding. In the manganous ion the cubic field does not completely lift the orbital degeneracy of the ground state. The lowest triplet is split into a singlet and a higher doublet by the rhombic component of the crystal field so that the g-values differ widely from the free spin value. The ion behaves with effective spin S = 1 / 2 and has g-valuee g x = 2. 624 Â± 0. 008, g y = 2. 182 ± 0. 008 and g z = 0. 72 ± 0. 05. The hyperfine structure is also anisotropic and the hyperfine structure constants are A x = 0. 00845 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1, A y = 0. 00465 Â± 0. 00005 cm - 1 and A z = 0. 0083 ± 0. 0013 cm - 1. The manganous ion in this type of compound resembles the titanic ion in ionic compounds and an attempt has been made to fit the parameters with the titanium theory of Abragam and Pryce (1951). This gives reasonable values for the configurational interaction constant and the mean value of the radius of the electron orbit. Nuclear spins The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of vanadium 50 has been measured in a crystal of K 4 Fe(CN) 6 3 H 2 O containing a few milligrams of vanadium enhanced to contain ~ 20 % 50 V. The spin was found to be six and the ratio of the nuclear gyromagnetic ratios of 50 V/ 51 V, 0. 380, agrees well with the value measured by nuclear resonance of 0. 3792. The spin and nuclear gyromagnetic ratio fit well with the values calculated by Hitchcock (1952) using a j-j spin-orbit coupling model of the nucleus and assuming &delta-function potential. The nuclear spin and magnetic moment of radioactive cobalt 57 have been measured in a crystal of K 2 Zn(SO 4) 2 6 H 2 O containing > 0. 5 μgrams of 57 Co. The crystal also contains some stable 59 Co up to 2. 4 μgrams total cobalt content. Only one set of hyperfine structure lines is resolved so tnat the spin and magnetic moment of 57 Co are tht same as 59 Co; i. e. the spin is 7 / 2 and the magnetic moment is 4. 6 ± 0. 2 nuclear magnetons. Chromic methylamine alum Paramagnetic resonance measurements on crystals of Cr(CH 3 NH 3 (SO 4) 12 H 2 2 O show that the crystals undergo a change in strucure at 157 ± 3 °K. Above this temperature the crystal symmetry is cubic and the Cr +++ ions are in a crystal field which has a small component. Below this temperature there is an additional rhombic componant in the crystal field and the crystal symmetry is lower, probably tetragonal. At both 90 °k and 20 °K the parameters in the spin hamiltonian are g = 1. 975 ± 0. 010, D = 0. 0871 ± 0. 0007 cm - 1 and K = 0. 0092 ± 0. 0008 cm - 1. These values give a stark splitting in zero field of 0. 177 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 which disagrees with the value of 0. 188 ± 0. 007 cm - 1 calculated by Kurti and Gardner (1954) from adiabatic demagnetisation measurements. Measurements at frequencies near the Stark splitting give results which lie between the two values so that it is not possible to say whether this descrepency is real. Measurements of nearest neighbour lines and of line widths indicate that there is extremely little exchange interaction between neighbouring Cr +++ ions. The transition is possibly due to a freezing out of a random rotary motion of the methylamine radical as the substance is cooled through the transition temperature. This temperature is the same as that found by Griffiths and Powell (1952) at which there is a discontinuity in the value of the dielectric constant. Interactions between neighbouring ions The p. r. spectrum of two adjacent consists of a series of lines, corresponding to the various orientations of the spins with respect to one another, which occur as satellites to the iines by isolated ions, the number of acid separation these satellites depends upon the size and nature of the interaction between them. The magnetic interaction may be calculated if the distance between the ions is known, so that if allowance is made for this, the size and nature of exchange interaction may be inferred from the positions of the satellite lines. Investigations of this sort have been done in crystals containing about 10 % paramagnetic salt in an isomorphous diamagnetic one, so that there is considerable chance of having two ions adjacent. A study of lanthanum ethyl sulphate containing up to 30 % neodymium shows that there is a small anisotropic exchange interaction with the two nearest neighbours and undetectable exchange interaction with the six next nearest. There is however no exchange with the next nearest neighbours in concentrated neodymium ethyl sulphate. This discrepancy is not explained. A study of nearest neigbbour satellites was made in KCr(SeO 4) 2 12 H 2 O. the problem is complicated by there being four ions in the unit cell all of which have different crystal field axes. It has not been possible to make an unambiguous interpretation of the results and the best interpretation does not agree with the results of adiabatic demagnetisation experiments of Kurti and Gardner (unpublished). The results of this type of investigation are rather discouraging and seem to indicate that one can hope to obtain satisfactory results only in particular substances. Rare earth ethyl sulphates Paramagnetic resonance has been observed in terbium etbyl sulphate using the yttrium salt as a dilutant. The spectrum may be explained using the hamiltonian postulated for the praseodymium salt (Bleaney and Seovil, 1952) : H = g // βH z S z + AS z I z + AS x where g // = 17. 72 ± 0. 02, S = 1 / 2, I = 3 / 2, A = 0. 209 ± 0. 002 cm - 1 and Δ = 0. 387 ± 0. 001 cm - 1. The lowest level is a doublet J z = ± 6 which is admixed with J x = 0 by the crystal field. This admixes the + 6 and - 6 levels and ΔM = 0 transitions are obtained if the r. f. magnetic field is placed parallel to tbe external field. The nuclear spin of terbium 159 is estimated to be 1. 5 ± 0. 4 nuclear magnetons. The work of Bleaney and Seovil (1952) on praseodymium ethyl sulphate has been extended using yttrium ethyl sulphate as a dilutant. The assymmetrical line shape is explained as being tbe result of the splitting Δ in the above hatmiltonian not having a single value but a Gaussian distribution of values, the nuclear magnetic moment of praseodymium 141 is estimated to be 4. 5 ± 1. 1 nuclear magnetons. </p...|$|E
