5|$|The {{presence}} of the two opposing armed forces, the Red and White Guards, imposed a state of <b>dual</b> <b>power</b> and multiple sovereignty on Finnish society, typically the prelude to a civil war. The decisive cleavage between the guards broke out during the General strike; the Reds executed several political opponents in southern Finland, and the first armed clashes between the Whites and Reds broke out. In total, 34 casualties were reported. Eventually, the political rivalries of 1917 led to a race for weapons and an escalation towards civil war.|$|E
5|$|Diocletian {{divided the}} empire into four regions, each {{ruled by a}} {{separate}} emperor, the Tetrarchy. Confident that he fixed the disorders that were plaguing Rome, he abdicated along with his co-emperor, and the Tetrarchy soon collapsed. Order was eventually restored by Constantine the Great, who became the first emperor to convert to Christianity, and who established Constantinople as the new capital of the eastern empire. During the decades of the Constantinian and Valentinian dynasties, the empire was divided along an east–west axis, with <b>dual</b> <b>power</b> centres in Constantinople and Rome. The reign of Julian, who attempted to restore Classical Roman and Hellenistic religion, only briefly interrupted the succession of Christian emperors. Theodosius I, the last emperor to rule over both East and West, died in 395 AD after making Christianity the official religion of the empire.|$|E
5|$|Towering {{over the}} Rhine valley, the Godesburg's {{strategic}} position commanded the roads leading {{to and from}} Bonn, the Elector of Cologne's capital city, and Cologne, the region's economic powerhouse. Over time, the Electors strengthened its walls and heightened its towers. They added a small residence in the 14th century and the donjon (also called a Bergfried or keep) developed as a stronghold of the Electoral archives and valuables. By the mid-16th century, the Godesburg was considered nearly impregnable and had {{become a symbol of}} the <b>dual</b> <b>power</b> of the Prince-electors and Archbishops of Cologne, one of the wealthiest ecclesiastical territories in the Holy Roman Empire. The Cologne War, a feud between the Protestant Elector, Gebhard, Truchsess of Waldburg, and the Catholic Elector, Ernst of Bavaria, was yet another schismatic episode in the Electoral and archdiocesan history.|$|E

During an all-night session, chaired by Khasbulatov, parliament declared the president's decree null and void. Rutskoy was proclaimed president and took the oath on the constitution. He dismissed Yeltsin and the key ministers Pavel Grachev (defense), Nikolay Golushko (security), and Viktor Yerin (interior).

25|$|In July, the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation {{confirmed}} {{the election of}} Pyotr Sumin to head {{the administration of the}} Chelyabinsk oblast, something that Yeltsin had refused to accept. As a result, a situation of <b>dual</b> <b>power</b> existed in that region from July to October in 1993, with two administrations claiming legitimacy simultaneously. Another conflict involved the decision of the Constitutional Court of the Russian Federation regarding the regional presidency in Mordovia. The court delegated the question of legality of abolishing the post of the region's president to the Constitutional Court of Mordovia. As a result, popularly elected President , member of the pro-Yeltsin Democratic Russia movement, lost his position.

25|$|A {{period of}} <b>dual</b> <b>power</b> ensued, {{during which the}} Provisional Government held state power while the {{national}} network of soviets, led by socialists, had the allegiance of the lower classes and, increasingly, the left-leaning urban middle class. During this chaotic period there were frequent mutinies, protests and many strikes. Many socialist political organizations were engaged in daily struggle and vied for influence within the Duma and the soviets, central among which were the Bolsheviks ("Ones of the Majority") led by Vladimir Lenin who campaigned for an immediate end to the war, land to the peasants, and bread to the workers. When the Provisional Government chose to continue fighting the war with Germany, the Bolsheviks and other socialist factions were able to exploit virtually universal disdain towards the war effort as justification to advance the revolution further. The Bolsheviks turned workers' militias under their control into the Red Guards (later the Red Army) over which they exerted substantial control.|$|E
25|$|In {{second half}} of 2008 the Solaris Urbino 18 Hybrid model went through several levels of {{modernisation}} {{and now it is}} considered to be at the second generation by the producer. Most of the changes are that of the power system of the electric hybrid engine, making a smaller and lighter engine, the Cummins ISBe5 250B with a volume of 6.7litre and the power of 178kW. The changes meant even lower fuel consumption - the older engine has reduced fuel usage by 15% compared to purely diesel propulsion while the new engine saves 23-24%. Thanks to further optimisation the Solaris is planning to reduce fuel consumption by 30%. Due to a lighter engine, the other power systems, like the batteries and <b>Dual</b> <b>Power</b> Inverter Module which are on the roof, work at an increased rate and produce more power. Due to this the model has also undergone a makeover of the general body, such as the aerodynamics, meaning only an air conditioning module can be fitted {{on the front of the}} bus. The estimated time for future modernisation, when new modules will be able to be added, is said to be about in 6–7 years, with an average usage of 60000km per year.|$|E

Intelligent <b>dual</b> input <b>power</b> system stabilizer (IDIPSS) comprises of NFS and conventional <b>dual</b> input <b>power</b> system stabilizer. The NFS is a fuzzy inference system implemented {{in the framework of}} multi-layered feed forward adaptive network.

The generator real power (Pe), reactive power (Qe), and terminal voltage (Vt) characterizing the operating condition are input signals to the network while optimum DIPSS parameters KS 1 and T 1 are the outputs. Investigations have been carried out considering three, five and seven membership functions (MFs) of Triangular, Trapezoidal, and Gaussian shapes. Studies reveal that for real-time tuning of the dual input PSS, the NFS network with three MFs of any shape is adequate. The proposed IDIPSS exhibits quite a robust performance to wide variations in loading condition, system parameters and large perturbations...|$|R

The immediate reason for the collapse of the Russian Empire was crisis caused by military defeats in the war against Imperial Germany and war-weariness among the Russians. The deeper causes lay in the collision between the most conservative and autocratic regime in Europe and the Russian people urging for socioeconomic modernization.
