5|$|<b>Haunting</b> Ground {{has been}} a subject of game studies {{regarding}} the relationship between players and their avatars. It {{was found that the}} altering states of Fiona's subjectivity change the role of the player in the game. The player is never a spectator, nor do they take on the embodiment of Fiona, but float between these states of involvement.|$|E
5|$|<b>Haunting</b> Ground {{was first}} {{revealed}} in September 2004, {{and was released}} next April garnering mixed to average reviews. The graphics and presentation were praised, but critics found the gameplay somewhat repetitive, predictable, and derivative of previous horror titles. The sexual objectification of Fiona was highlighted by some critics {{as one of the}} game's best elements. They found that by illustrating her as an object of desire, the game makes Fiona and therefore the player feel more fragile and endangered, building a more disturbing atmosphere. The fluctuating degree of player control over Fiona has made <b>Haunting</b> Ground a key subject in the study of avatars and their relationship with players in video games.|$|E

In the late 1960s to early 1970s, <b>haunted</b> attractions were developed in larger American cities like Louisville, Kentucky and Cincinnati, Ohio {{with the creation of}} Jaycees <b>haunted</b> houses. These <b>haunted</b> houses are run by local chapters of the Jaycees. There are still many local chapter Jaycees <b>haunted</b> houses in towns such as Lombard, Illinois; Foxborough, Massachusetts; Raleigh, North Carolina; and Columbia, South Carolina.
