50|$|The 071 Class was {{available}} as a 00 gauge Resin kit by Model Irish Railways (MIR) but is no longer made. It included transfers, brass detailing (railings, fans, grills) and <b>flush</b> <b>glazing.</b> Note the paint included is the Golden Brown hue and not the existing deep orange (RAL2011).|$|E
50|$|Containing 41 {{floors and}} {{standing}} at 152m tall, BHP House was designed in a ‘Modern Style’ during the 1960s. At the time, the design was intentionally promoting {{the use of}} steel in Australian construction and sought to establish new national height standards for a steel-framed structure. Consisting of three dominant materials - steel, concrete and glass - BHP House {{was in fact the}} tallest building in the city upon completion. The buildings ‘sheer glazed curtain wall’ was juxtaposed by banded curtain walls of the 1950s and 1960s and thus was often compared to the works of Mies van der Rohe, due to its detachment from surrounding cityscape, and its presence as a ‘three dimensional sculptural monument’. In the architectural field, BHP House is {{regarded as one of the}} more notable projects by Yuncken Freeman Architects due to cutting edge techniques for an office building such as <b>flush</b> <b>glazing,</b> minimalist interiors and expressed structural bracing.|$|E
25|$|Accommodation was {{provided}} for pilot and passenger/navigator in two closed cockpits. The pilot {{sat in the}} rear cockpit aft of the wing trailing-edges under a small forward-sliding canopy and flip-open side panels. The passenger/navigators cockpit had a <b>flush</b> <b>glazed</b> roof and was situated over the centre-section.|$|R
60|$|The {{execution}} had {{now been}} duly carried out. Ted Baldwin, who sprawled {{now in the}} seat of honour beside the Bodymaster, had been chief of the party. His <b>flushed</b> face and <b>glazed,</b> bloodshot eyes told of sleeplessness and drink. He and his two comrades {{had spent the night}} before among the mountains. They were unkempt and weather-stained. But no heroes, returning from a forlorn hope, could have had a warmer welcome from their comrades.|$|R
50|$|The {{house is}} built of red brick with a tile roof. It has four gables facing the street, {{alternately}} shaped and stepped, and features three storeys. The {{sections of the}} house frontage differ. The left section has six double-hung, <b>flush</b> windows with <b>glazing</b> bars, flat brick arches and small brick cornice mouldings. The right section windows have cambered brick relieving arches. The ground floor has an entrance door with wooden architrave and hood on carved brackets. The gables have brick copings and the ground and first floor have brick bands. The interior is reported to feature a semi-circular recess with fluted pilasters and moulded cornice and newel staircase in oak. The exterior is partially covered with wisteria vine.|$|R
50|$|The He 176 {{was built}} to utilise {{one of the new}} Walter engines. It was a tiny, simple aircraft, built almost entirely out of wood, but did possess an advanced, totally {{enclosed}} cockpit, with a frameless single-piece clear nose, through which the pilot's rudder pedal mounts were visible, and a <b>flush</b> upper cockpit <b>glazing</b> which was removable for entering the aircraft, making the cockpit fit completely within the forward, bullet-like contours of the fuselage. The landing gear was a combination of conventional and tricycle gear designs, with the main gear's struts intended to retract rearwards into the fuselage, with a fixed, aerodynamically faired nose wheel and strut, and a retractable tail wheel. A unique feature of the He 176 was its jettisonable nose escape system. Compressed air was used to separate the nose from the aircraft. A drogue chute was used to reduce the opening force required. After the drogue was deployed, the flush-fitting cockpit canopy was released and a conventional pilot/parachute bailout occurred.|$|R
5000|$|The {{first of}} the four G4M2 prototypes flew in December 1942 (Mitsubishi Navy Type 1 Attack Bomber Model 22). It {{differed}} from the preceding model in having Mitsubishi MK4P [...] "Kasei" [...] Model 21 engines with VDM electric four-blade propellers capable of full feathering function, redesigned main wings with LB type laminar flow airfoil. and widened tail horizontal stabilizer wing area, which improved service ceiling to 8950 m and maximum speed to [...] Main wing fuel tanks were enlarged to 6490 L which increased the range to 6000 km (overloaded, one way). An electrically powered dorsal turret featuring a 20 mm Type 99 cannon was introduced in place of G4M1s dorsal position with a 7.7 mm Type 92 machine gun, total guns armed were two 20 mm Type 99 cannons (one tail turret, one top turret), and four 7.7 mm Type 92 machine guns (one nose, two waist, and one cockpit side). External differences also included increased nose <b>glazing,</b> <b>flush</b> side gun positions instead of blisters, and rounded tips of wings and tail surfaces. These major improvements also {{made it possible for}} the G4M2 to carry more powerful bombs; one 1055 kg Navy Type 91 Kai-7 aerial torpedo or one 800 kg bomb or two 500 kg bombs or one 800 kg Type 3 No. 31 bomb (ray-detective type bomb) and twelve 60 kg bombs. The G4M2 entered service in mid-1943.|$|R
