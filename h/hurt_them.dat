5|$|The sexual {{allegations}} apart, {{several people}} discussed how the vegetotherapy had <b>hurt</b> <b>them</b> physically as children, as therapists pressed {{hard on the}} body to loosen muscular armour. Reich's son, Peter, wrote in his autobiography, Book of Dreams (1973) about the pain this had caused him. Susanna Steig, the daughter of William Steig, the New Yorker cartoonist, wrote about being pressed so hard during Reichian therapy that she had difficulty breathing, and said that a woman therapist had sexually assaulted her. According to Turner, a nurse complained in 1952 to the New York Medical Society that an OIRC therapist had taught her five-year-old son how to masturbate. The therapist was arrested, but the case was dropped when Reich agreed to close the OIRC.|$|E

25|$|Landlords opt for {{sharecropping}} {{to avoid}} the administrative costs and shirking that occurs on plantations and haciendas.

25|$|Middlesex, however, beat Hampshire rather {{comfortably in}} the County Championship the {{following}} week, to send Hampshire nearer the relegation mire, {{and after the}} loss to Nottinghamshire in the National League it became woefully clear that Hampshire's lack of Pietersen and Warne <b>hurt</b> <b>them.</b> However, they succeeded in digging out a 35-run win over Sussex, who only needed 104 for seven wickets on the fourth day, but were bowled out by Dimitri Mascarenhas and Sean Ervine. Two rained off matches followed, against Bangladesh A and Worcestershire Royals.|$|E
25|$|The use {{of animals}} in the circus has been {{controversial}} since animal welfare groups have documented instances of animal cruelty during the training of performing animals. Numerous instances of animal abuse in circuses have been documented such as confining enclosures, lack of regular veterinary care, abusive training methods and lack of oversight by regulating bodies. Animal trainers have argued that some criticism {{is not based on}} fact, including beliefs that shouting makes the animals believe the trainer is going to <b>hurt</b> <b>them,</b> that caging is cruel and common, and the harm caused by the use of whips, chains or training implements.|$|E

25|$|Rakuten {{brought home}} their first Japan Series win after their Game 7 home {{win over the}} Giants. Eagles' starter Mima pitched for six innings and gave up only one hit, struck out five and walked three. Norimoto then {{relieved}} Mima to pitch two scoreless innings, and Tanaka came in to close out the ninth earning him a save. Tanaka's one-inning save came {{the day after he}} pitched a 160-pitch complete game loss. The Giants' offensive problems throughout the series <b>hurt</b> <b>them</b> again in Game 7 where they hit only 5 singles and were shutout. The Eagles immediately took the lead in the first inning on a run-scoring error by Giants' shortstop Hayato Sakamoto. The following inning, they added to their lead with Takero Okajima’s RBI-double. The final insurance run came with Akihisa Makida's solo home run in the fourth inning.|$|E
25|$|Catholic social {{teaching}} {{is based on}} the teaching of Jesus and commits Catholics to the welfare of others. Although the Catholic Church operates numerous social ministries throughout the world, individual Catholics are also required to practice spiritual and corporal works of mercy. Corporal works of mercy include feeding the hungry, welcoming strangers, immigrants or refugees, clothing the naked, taking care of the sick and visiting those in prison. Spiritual works require the Catholic to share their knowledge with others, to give advice to those who need it, comfort those who suffer, have patience, forgive those who <b>hurt</b> <b>them,</b> give correction to those who need it, and pray for the living and the dead. The sacrament of Anointing of the Sick, however, is performed by a priest, who will anoint with oil the head and hands of the ill person and pray a special prayer for them while laying on hands.|$|E

Husk is forgiven for her betrayal since she was of unsound mind and is made the Academy's new guidance counselor, however Toad is fired. As he is leaving Husk apologizes to him for being unable to remember what happened between them, he claims he knew it was too good to last. Before he leaves she arranges a date at a local coffee shop, but the city is attacked by self-replicating energy bots built by Maximilian Frankenstein so he and Manuel Endque could escape the Grey Academy. The X-Men defeat the robots, and half the coffee shop has been destroyed. Endque was found by the X-Men having been severely beaten by Toad on Frankenstein's orders, Toad seemingly now working for Frankenstein, wanting to go someplace nobody can <b>hurt</b> <b>them.</b> Endque passes on a message to Husk that Toad left because he knew even if things went well between them one day she'd wake up and see him for what he really was.

500|$|In Queensland, Australia {{there are}} many areas for high {{protection}} of the bluespotted stingray, three being the Shoalwater, Corio Bay's Area Ramsar Site, and the Great Barrier Reef Marine Park.

500|$|In the end, the {{president}} and cabinet decided against selling the ships because they feared it would <b>hurt</b> <b>them</b> politically.

The executive's apprehension was heightened by Barbosa's speech given before the revolt's end, as he also used the occasion to attack the government, or {{what he called the}} [...] "brutal militaristic regime." [...] Still, the Brazilians ordered Armstrong to cease working towards laying down their third dreadnought, which induced the Argentine government to not pick up their contractual option for a third dreadnought, and the United States' ambassador to Brazil cabled home to state that the Brazilian desire for naval preeminence in Latin America was quelled, though this proved to be short-lived.|$|E

Subsequently, the Wayne County Medical Examiner's Office confirmed the cause of death as suicide by hanging.

500|$|According to Saadiq, {{the opening}} track [...] "Thinking of You" [...] is [...] "a really soul, southern, funky song" [...] {{inspired}} by Al Green.

On [...] "Still a Man", he sings {{from the perspective of}} a man who was left by his wife to raise their children alone. The backing vocalists sing the meditative hook, [...] "Have you ever loved somebody / Who loves you so much it hurts you to <b>hurt</b> <b>them</b> so bad?" [...] On [...] "Holy Smokes & Gee Whiz", Saadiq's older brother Randall Wiggins sings lead. The song was described by Washington City Paper journalist Rickey Wright as a modernized version of the Stylistics' 1972 song [...] "Betcha by Golly, Wow", featuring [...] "a dead-on impression of Russell Thompkins' unmistakable falsetto and precise diction". [...] "Annie May" [...] was written by Wiggins as a story about a [...] "good girl next door" [...] who becomes an exotic dancer, while [...] "Let Me Know" [...] is a love song with Wall of Sound elements. According to Nick Krewen of The Spectator, [...] "Wild Child" [...] is [...] "a ballad in the grand sense" [...] of the 1977 Earth, Wind & Fire song [...] "Be Ever Wonderful". [...] "Party Don't Cry" [...] is a meditation on mortality with jazzy, philosophical overtones. Wright believed the song [...] "expresses an overt spirituality unheard in the Tonyies' past songs". The closing track is a gospel-influenced instrumental and variation of [...] "Lovin' You" [...] composed by Saadiq. Its sole lyric, according to Wright, is an universalist platitude.|$|E
500|$|In January 2010, Montag {{revealed}} to People {{that she had}} undergone ten cosmetic surgery procedures {{in a single day}} two months prior, performed by Frank Ryan. Among the procedures were brow-lifts, ear-pinnings, a chin reduction, as well as a second rhinoplasty and second breast augmentation. She commented that she almost died from too much Demerol, reducing her heart rate to five beats per minute. Her debut studio album Superficial was digitally released later that month to an overwhelmingly negative critical response from critics. The self-funded record cost nearly $2 million and sold approximately 1,000 copies in first-week downloads, failing to earn back the money spent making it. In May, she and Pratt made their final appearance on The Hills halfway through the sixth and final season. In December 2013, Montag stated that she and Conrad have [...] "talked a few times" [...] since the series' conclusion, elaborating that [...] "it's unfortunate things happened the way that it did, but we're both different people now, older and more mature."

Montag was universally lambasted for bringing up the sex tape lies anew, parroting the views of Pratt (who Conrad actually blamed for spreading the false rumors; Conrad felt Montag knew he was lying but took Pratt's side because she loved him) and trying to use Conrad's name to get publicity for herself.|$|E
