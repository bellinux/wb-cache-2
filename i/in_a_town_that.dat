500|$|The {{accusations against}} Barnette were big news <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>that</b> had little crime. Gambling and {{drinking}} were common throughout town. Prostitution {{was restricted to}} a district separated {{from the rest of}} town by a wooden fence. The [...] "line," [...] as it was known, operated until the 1950s with the tacit approval of city authorities. Fights were common, but gunplay was not. As one miner recalled, not more than one man in 500 carried a gun, and while fisticuffs were common, gunfights were not. This was backed up by the experience of Northern Commercial Company stagecoach drivers, who carried more than $7 million overland during a 12-year period without a single incident.|$|E

[...] (See photo herein) [...] Hotel Ingram is written in limestone on the second story of the building's facade. The building was constructed in 1893, and opened to the public on January 9, 1894. The hotel originally had 45 guest rooms, and featured a large dining room with excellent food. [...] The hotel building included a saloon known as the Ingram Bar.

2500|$|Asbury Park's nightlife {{includes}} The Stone Pony. On Main Street is The Saint, (formerly the Clover Club), a {{club that}} showcases local and emerging acts, {{as well as}} established performers. Across town, on Fourth Avenue, is Asbury Lanes, a no longer functioning vintage bowling alley and bar with live performances ranging from musical acts, neo-Burlesque, hot rod, and art shows. Though it has been closed for now, it is currently being restored to its former glory. Bought by the newly opened Asbury Hotel sitting adjacent on Fifth Avenue, it will be connected with the hotel. An above ground passageway has already been built to connect the two buildings. An educated guess to its reopening would be Spring 2017. The Baronet, a vintage movie theater which dates back to Buster Keaton's era, was near Asbury Lanes, but its roof recently caved in and the building was demolished. The Asbury Hotel pays homage to this once great theater with its 5th floor rooftop movie theater called [...] "The Baronet". The Asbury Hotel also has an 8th floor rooftop bar, paying homage to the former building inhabitants and calling it [...] "Salvation". <b>In</b> <b>a</b> <b>town</b> <b>that</b> was once nearly abandoned, there are now over 60 restaurants, bars, coffee houses, two breweries, a coffee roastery, and live music venues situated in Asbury Park's boardwalk and downtown districts.|$|E

60|$|On the 20th day of March, 1775, {{a little}} girl was trudging along a country road, with a basket of eggs on her arm.

She was a rosy-faced, bright-eyed lass of fourteen, full of vigor, courage, and patriotism, and just then much excited by the frequent rumors which reached Concord that the British were coming to destroy the stores sent there for safe keeping while the enemy occupied Boston. Tabby glowed with wrath at the idea, and (metaphorically speaking) shook her fist at august King George, being a stanch little Rebel, ready to fight and die for her country rather than submit to tyranny of any kind.|$|E

The Mongul general whom Genghis Khan had commissioned to take the town was his third son, Oktay. Oktay had heard of the fame of the sheikh, and had conceived a very high respect for him. So he sent a herald to the wall with a passport for the sheikh, and for ten other persons such as he should choose, giving him free permission to leave the town and go wherever he pleased. But the sheikh declined the offer. Then Oktay sent in another passport, with permission to the sheikh to take a thousand men with him. But he still refused. He could not accept Oktay's bounty, he said, unless it were extended to all the Mohammedans in the town. He was obliged to take his lot with the rest, for he was bound to his people by ties too strong to be easily sundered.|$|E

And who cares for the town when one can sit on the bench at the headland, and look out over the huge, blue bay, and the yellow scimitar that curves before it. I loved it when its great face was {{freckled}} with the fishing boats, and I loved it when the big ships went past, far out, a little hillock of white and no hull, with topsails curved like a bodice, so stately and demure. But most of all I loved it when no trace of man marred the majesty of Nature, and when the sun-bursts slanted down on it from between the drifting rainclouds. Then I have seen the further edge draped in the gauze of the driving rain, with its thin grey shading under the slow clouds, while my headland was golden, and the sun gleamed upon the breakers and struck deep through the green waves beyond, showing up the purple patches where the beds of seaweed are lying. Such a morning as that, with the wind in his hair, and the spray on his lips, and the cry of the eddying gulls in his ear, may send a man back braced afresh to the reek of a sick-room, and the dead, drab weariness of practice.|$|E
