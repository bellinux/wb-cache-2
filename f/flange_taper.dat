40|$|Composite {{flooring}} systems {{supported by}} tapered (varying web depth) beams are very attractive {{from an economic}} point of view. However, the tapered beam sections are fabricated from plate by welding, and are susceptible to imperfection effects. These may interact with the localised compressive stress field that is generated in the web at a slope change in the lower flange to cause local web buckling. A substantial parametric study using a non-linear elasto-plastic finite element program and covering practical ranges of the important parameters including {{the area of the}} tension <b>flange,</b> <b>taper</b> slope and web thickness is reported. Moment-rotation relations, peak moments and failure mechanisms have been predicted. The validity of the work is supported by the good correlation obtained between the results of the parametric study and experimental data...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this thesis is to report a {{theoretical}} investigation concerned with the effect of web and <b>flange</b> <b>taper</b> on the lateral stability of a uniformly loaded, cantilever I-beam. The I-beam is loaded along its entire length in the plane of maximum flexural rigidity. The web and flanges are tapered linearly from the free end to the fixed end. Results are obtained for three positions of load application: at the top flange, at the shear center or centroid, and at the bottom flange. In each case, the initial direction of the load is vertical through the shear center and the load is assumed to remain acting in a vertical direction, but is allowed to move as the beam deflects. The governing differential equations are derived and the method of finite differences is used to numerically solve these equations. Tables and representative plots of the results are provided from which the critical buckling load may be readily determined...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, the flexural-torsional {{buckling}} {{and free}} vibration of tapered thin-walled beam-columns with arbitrary cross-section shape are extensively investigated. The governing equilibrium equations and motion equations are {{obtained from the}} stationary condition of the potential energy. The strain energy is derived in presence of initial stresses. In {{the work of the}} applied forces, effects of load eccentricities from shear and centroid centerlines are taken into account. Free vibration is considered in presence of harmonic excitations. In presence of arbitrary boundary conditions and variable cross-section properties, a semi-analytical approach based on power series method is adopted in solution. According to this method, displacements and geometric constants are approximated by polynomial functions up to a certain order, where accurate results are reached. The flexural-torsional buckling loads or natural frequencies are determined by solving an eigenvalue problem. In order to measure the accuracy and to check the validity of the present method, several examples including flexural-torsional behavior and free vibration analysis of non-prismatic thin-walled members with web and <b>flange</b> <b>tapering</b> and various boundary conditions are considered. The obtained results are compared to the finite element simulations and other available solutions...|$|R

40|$|International audienceIn this paper, a {{numerical}} method is presented {{for the free}} vibration and stability analyses of tapered thinwalled beams with arbitrary open cross sections. The proposed method takes the flexural-torsional coupling effect of tapered thin-walled beams with arbitrary open cross sections into account. The total potential energy is derived for an elastic behavior from the strain energy, the kinetic energy and work of the loads applied on the cross section contour. Free vibration is considered {{in the presence of}} harmonic excitations. The effects of the initial stresses and load eccentricities are also considered in stability analysis. The governing equilibrium equations, motion equations and the associated boundary conditions are derived from the stationary condition. As in the presence of tapering, stiffness quantities are not constant; therefore, the power series approximation is used to solve the fourth-order differential equations. Displacement components and cross-section properties are expanded in terms of power series of a known degree. Then, the shape functions are obtained by deriving the deformation shape of tapered thin-walled member as power series form. Finally, stiffness and mass matrices are carried out by means of the principle of virtual work along the member's axis. In order to measure the accuracy and check the validity of this method, the natural frequencies and buckling loads of non-prismatic thin-walled beams with web and <b>flange</b> <b>tapering</b> and various boundary conditions are obtained and compared to the results of finite element analysis using Ansys software and those of other available numerical and analytical ones. It can be seen that the results of present study are in a good agreement with other available theoretical and analytical methods...|$|R

40|$|Experiments {{have been}} {{conducted}} with a molten salt loop at Sandia National Laboratories in Albuquerque, NM to resolve issues associated with {{the operation of the}} 10 MW{sub e} Solar Two Central Receiver Power Plant located near Barstow, CA. The salt loop contained two receiver panels, components such as flanges and a check valve, vortex shedding and ultrasonic flow meters, and an impedance pressure transducer. Tests were conducted on procedures for filling and thawing a panel, and assessing components and instrumentation in a molten salt environment. Four categories of experiments were conducted: (1) cold filling procedures, (2) freeze/thaw procedures, (3) component tests, and (4) instrumentation tests. Cold-panel and -piping fill experiments are described, in which the panels and piping were preheated to temperatures below the salt freezing point prior to initiating flow, to determine the feasibility of cold filling the receiver and piping. The transient thermal response was measured, and heat transfer coefficients and transient stresses were calculated from the data. Freeze/thaw experiments were conducted with the panels, in which the salt was intentionally allowed to freeze in the receiver tubes, then thawed with heliostat beams. Slow thermal cycling tests were conducted to measure both how well various designs of <b>flanges</b> (e. g., <b>tapered</b> <b>flanges</b> or clamp type flanges) hold a seal under thermal conditions typical of nightly shut down, and the practicality of using these flanges on high maintenance components.

Both the flange and the web are tapered linearly. The load is allowed to move with the structure as it deflects, but its direction does not change, i. e., the load remains vertical. The governing differential equations are derived and the method of finite differences is used to solve the problems. Three cases are studied: load at the top flange, at the shear center, and at the bottom flange. In each case the initial direction of the load is through the shear center. Curves are plotted for a range of tapers from which may be obtained the critical buckling load. Three solutions are compared with experimental results obtained at Columbia University...|$|R

The cover plates were integrated in the connection to act as replaceable links after seismic actions. A series of full-scale laboratory experiments of the joint was conducted to investigate its energy dissipation and hysteretic response. The cover plates used in the experimental work had the same geometry but differed from each other on steel grade, bolt-holes size, use of stiffeners and bolts’ preloading force. The results confirmed that the main energy dissipation fuse in these connections was yielding in the reduced section areas of the cover plates. Connection slip created a second fuse of energy dissipation when bolts preloading force was properly controlled. Department of Civil and Environmental Engineerin...|$|R

40|$|Use of {{parallel}} flange I beam sections is advantageous than <b>tapered</b> <b>flange</b> I beam sections  due to, increased lateral stiffness, sections {{do not have}} sloping flanges and excessive material  in web and easy to weld and bolt. Nowadays the hot rolled parallel flange, narrow parallel  flange beams (NPB) and wide parallel flange beams (WPB) sections as per Indian standards,  having yield stress, 300 MPa, 350 MPa and 410 MPa are being manufactured. Available  range of these sections {{can be used for}} steel moment resisting frames (SMRF’s) and  prequalified connections as per AISC codes.

40|$|Certain {{types of}} {{structural}} elements, like riveted or rolled beams and girders, etc., of older steels, often have <b>tapered</b> <b>flanges</b> and the steels themselves {{are as a}} rule mor or less inhomogeneous. The fracture toughness at in-plane loading of related structural details, has been observed to vary significantly in the thickness direction and generally increases outwardly from the mid-section part. The most common fracture toughness test specimen used for testing of samples taken from oldes steel structures, in e. g. assessment work, is the three point bend specimen. This specimen, like all standard specimen types, is plane-parallel and if machined from a tapered part it will not necessarily yield a fair estimate of the effective fracture toughness for a through crack in situations where fracture toughness varies across the thickness. In view of this, a modified three point bend specimen with partly tapered sides has been designed so as to accomodate samples with this feature. The project includes calibration, testing and evalutation of the modified specimen. The firt part of the project, which is reported here, is mainly analytical and is aimed at obtaining a first and rough estimate {{of the order of}} influence the modified geometry upon crack tip parameters.

40|$|The {{difference}} in delamination onset predictions {{based on the}} type and location of the assumed initial damage are compared in a specimen consisting of a <b>tapered</b> <b>flange</b> laminate bonded to a skin laminate. From previous experimental work, the damage was identified to consist of a matrix crack in the top skin layer followed by a delamination between the top and second skin layer (+ 45 /- 45 interface). Two-dimensional finite elements analyses were performed for three different assumed flaws and the results show a considerable reduction in critical load if an initial delamination {{is assumed to be}} present, both under tension and bending loads. For a crack length corresponding to the peak in the strain energy release rate, the delamination onset load for an assumed initial flaw in the bondline is slightly higher than the critical load for delamination onset from an assumed skin matrix crack, both under tension and bending loads. As a result, assuming an initial flaw in the bondline is simpler while providing a critical load relatively close to the real case. For the configuration studied, a small delamination might form at a lower tension load than the critical load calculated for a 12. 7 mm (0. 5 ") delamination, but it would grow in a stable manner. For the bending case, assuming an initial flaw of 12. 7 mm (0. 5 ") is conservative, the crack would grow unstably...|$|R
40|$|Osseointegration {{is vital}} to the success of total knee arthroplasty. This {{intimate}} bone integration however, mostly occured on the femoral component but not on the tibial component. Failure to achieve sufficient primary fixation of the tibial component has been regarded as the major factor affecting bone growth. The problem would be more apparent under eccentric loading which created complex rocking motions in both flexion and extension during gait. Fixation features in terms of protrusion on the undersurface of the tibial component include flange, screws and stem. In this study, the effect of three fixation features under physiological loading was analysed using non-linear contact finite element analysis. Three dimensional model of a human tibia was reconstructed from CT dataset. Three different tibial compartments â€” the cross-flange, the linear <b>flange</b> and the <b>tapered</b> cylindrical shaft â€” were modeled without the polymeric tibial insert. The component was then positioned on the tibial plateau and bone preparation was virtually simulated. Each model was then meshed with solid tetrahedrals and material properties were assigned to the bone and the prostheses. Coefficient of friction between the bone and the implant was set to 0. 3. Pressure was applied on the medial plateau with magnitude corresponds to an eccentric load of 1250 N. Non-linear contact analysis was performed on each of the three components, together with a validated micromotion algorithm to predict instability at the bone-implant interface. Results showed that the cross flange was the most stable under eccentric load with micromotion values did not exceed the threshold limit for osseointegration...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{demand for}} very heavily {{serviced}} widespan office floors has led, {{as a natural}} development {{of the concept of}} haunched and tapered frames, to the use of composite flooring systems supported by tapered (varying web depth) beams. These systems are very attractive from an economic point of view, combining wide spans, rapid erection and easy access to services between the shallow parts of the beam and the ceiling below. One of the most pressing needs is for {{a better understanding of the}} local buckling behaviour of the relatively deep slender web at changes of slope in the lower flange, in particular at the slope change which occurs at the centre of a beam whose depth increases linearly from each support. In the past, with plate girders, this failure mechanism was less relevant than lateral torsional buckling. With the substantial top flange of a composite section, lateral buckling is less likely, and local buckling more likely to govern the design. The tapered beam sections are fabricated from plates by welding and are susceptible to imperfection effects and residual stresses. These phenomena may interact with the localized compressive stress field which is generated in the web at any slope change in the flange to cause local web buckling. The provision of local stiffening is technically feasible, but very expensive. The beam itself is produced fully automatically and the subsequent hand installation of stiffeners consumes man-hours out of all proportion to the weight of steel involved. The prime objective of the present study was to iucntify the relative importance of several parameters that influence the phenomenon, such as angle of <b>taper,</b> web thickness, <b>flange</b> area and others. For practical reasons, the experiments were executed at half-scale and the models simulated the concrete slab of the composite beam by a heavy steel top <b>flange.</b> Three <b>tapered</b> models have been tested with different web thicknesses i. e, 3, 5, and 7 millimetres. Three more specimens with different plastic neutral axis positions were also tested. An extensive parametric study has been made using a non-linear elastoplastic finite element program. This study covered practical ranges of the important parameters including the area of the tension flange and the position of the plastic neutral axis. Moment-rotation relations, peak moments and failure mechanisms have been predicted. Very good correlation was obtained between the results of the parametric study and the experiments. It has become apparent that in the great majority of practical cases it is possible to avoid the use of the expensive hand welded stiffeners. A design formulation has been developed to produce a very simple test of the need for stiffeners. Open Acces...|$|R
40|$|Tubular columns own many {{structural}} and architectural advantages that, in certain cases, {{make them more}} favourable than open-section columns in steel moment-resisting frames. These advantages are sometimes underexploited due to the relative lack of design guidance on their moment joints to open-section beams, in particular on semi-rigid joints with special detailing for seismic actions. Different configurations of I-beam to tubular column joints have been investigated in the past, including through, internal and external diaphragm joints. This project investigates experimentally the cyclic behaviour of an external diaphragm joint between a steel I-beam and a circular hollow section column. The proposed joint includes two diaphragm plates (DPs) welded to the outer circumference of the column and bolted to the I-beam <b>flanges</b> with two <b>tapered</b> cover plates (TCPs). A web stub is welded to the column face and bolted to the I-beam web. Full-scale laboratory experiments were conducted to investigate the hysteretic response and energy dissipative performance of the proposed joint under cyclic loading. TCPs were integrated in the joint to act as replaceable sacrificial components that dissipate most of the energy whilst {{the rest of the}} joint components remain elastic to minimise the post-seismic repair. The test specimens were identical except their TCPs that had the same geometry but differed in steel grade, size of bolt-holes, use of stiffeners or bolt preloading force. The use of higher grades of steel for the TCPs and stiffening them imposed higher strain demands in the beam and DPs and dissipated less energy than the joints with lower grades and unstiffened TCPs, respectively. The results confirmed that the main energy dissipation fuse in these joints was yielding in the TCPs while the other components remained elastic. Connection slippage created a second fuse for energy dissipation when the bolt preloading force was properly controlled, and the rotation of the plastic hinge region exceeded the minimum threshold of 25 mrad for medium ductility class structures...|$|R
