5|$|The Australian <b>jelly</b> {{industry}} is worth approximately $1121million per annum, and Aeroplane <b>Jelly</b> is the market leader with a 25% share. Over 19million packets of Aeroplane <b>Jelly</b> are sold each year. Strawberry flavour {{is the top}} selling <b>jelly</b> variant with nearly 2 million packs sold each year. In 1953, Aeroplane <b>Jelly</b> introduced Australia's first low calorie <b>jelly.</b> In 1988, in honour of the Australian Bicentenary, <b>jelly</b> was available in special Australian flavours such as Lilly Pilly, Quandong and Midjinberry. These flavours were phased out by 1992. Now Aeroplane <b>Jelly</b> is owned by American company, McCormicks foods; {{it used to be}} owned by Traders Pty Ltd. One of the least selling though was the lemon flavor which sold over 100,000 packets per annum.|$|E
5|$|Adolphus Herbert Frederick Norman Appleroth, {{known as}} Bert Appleroth, was a tram {{conductor}} who created <b>jelly</b> crystals using gelatine {{and sugar in}} his bathtub. He sold these <b>jelly</b> crystals door-to-door, using his tram route to transport him around Sydney. In 1917, Appleroth rented premises to manufacture his <b>jelly,</b> then formed a company with Albert Francis Lenertz named Traders Pty Ltd in 1927. Planes were considered new and exciting at the time, so aviation fan Appleroth named the brand Aeroplane <b>Jelly.</b> Appleroth used a Tiger Moth plane to make deliveries to rural areas in 1934, and his publicity stunts and Aeroplane Jelly's advertising campaigns made the <b>jelly</b> a national icon, like Holden and Vegemite.|$|E

40|$|Soft {{homemade}} {{jams and}} <b>jellies</b> {{can be an}} unfortunate occurrence and are often the result of using overripe fruit, fruit lacking the appropriate acidity, using the wrong amount of sugar, increasing the recipe, not bringing the product up to a full rolling boil, using old pectin or not enough pectin, or numerous other causes. Both canned (cooked) and freezer (uncooked) jams and <b>jellies</b> can be remade if the products are too soft.

5|$|Apples are an {{important}} ingredient in many desserts, such as apple pie, apple crumble, apple crisp and apple cake. They are often eaten baked or stewed, and {{they can also be}} dried and eaten or reconstituted (soaked in water, alcohol or some other liquid) for later use.

T.foliacea is larger, brown, and leafy in appearance. Auricularia auricula is also larger, typically brown, is disc- or ear-shaped, with a ribbed undersurface. Microscopically, Tremella foliacea and Auricularia auricula are easily distinguished from A.sarcoides {{by the presence of}} basidia (rather than asci).|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT This study {{aimed to}} prepare <b>jellies</b> of {{conventional}} type of red strawberry guava (with added sucrose) and no added sugar {{and evaluate the}} physical and chemical composition and content of bioactive compounds in them. Four <b>jellies</b> formulations were prepared: conventional with addition of sucrose (F 1), aspartame (F 2), saccharin and cyclamate (F 3), acesulfame and sucralose (F 4). Physicochemical analysis of pH were carried out, as well as analysis of titratable acidity, total soluble solids, ashes, proteins, lipids, moisture, carbohydrates, calories, lightness, color tone, total phenols, anthocyanins, carotenoids, ascorbic acid and antioxidant activity, by the capture of DPPH and ABTS radicals. Conventional and no added sugars <b>jellies</b> did not differ for total phenols, total anthocyanins and ascorbic acid. However, processing exerted significant influence (p= 0. 05) on total carotenoids and antioxidant activity. It is feasible to use red strawberry guava for the preparation of conventional and no added sugar <b>jellies.</b> The products, however, show {{a significant difference in}} carotenoids content, with the highest content of these and higher antioxidant activity in processed <b>jellies</b> without sugars addition...|$|R
25|$|High-ester pectins set {{at higher}} {{temperatures}} than low-ester pectins. However, gelling reactions with calcium increase as {{the degree of}} esterification falls. Similarly, lower pH-values or higher soluble solids (normally sugars) increase gelling speed. Suitable pectins can therefore be selected for jams and for <b>jellies,</b> or for higher sugar confectionery <b>jellies.</b>|$|R
