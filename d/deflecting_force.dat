40|$|Let us recount {{some of the}} {{characteristics}} of the motion of particles and the propagation of waves, with a view toward analyzing the behavior of light. In accordance with Newton 2 ̆ 7 s first law, a particle moves in a straight-line path in the absence of external forces. Thus we might infer, as Newton suggested, that light is composed of particles, and that, in a continuous medium, there is no <b>deflecting</b> <b>force</b> on the light particles. At the interface between two media, light may be propagated in a straight line parallel to the interface. Thus even at an interface there is no force on the particles of light unless the light passes through the interface, and in that event the force acting must be perpendicular to the interface. To account for the fact that light is refracted toward the normal on passing from a rare to a dense medium, as from air to water as shown in Figure 40 - 1, it is necessary to assume that the force is directed from the rare to the dense medium. The normal component of the velocity is increased, while the tangential component remains the same, so that the refracted ray is more nearly directed toward the normal. From this we see that a particle theory of light implies that the velocity of light in the dense medium is greater than the velocity of light in the rare medium...|$|E
40|$|Directed {{energy for}} {{planetary}} defense {{is now a}} viable option and is superior in many ways to other proposed technologies, being able to defend the Earth against all known threats. This paper presents basic ideas behind a directed energy planetary defense system that utilizes laser ablation of an asteroid to impart a <b>deflecting</b> <b>force</b> on the target. A conceptual philosophy called DE-STAR, which stands for Directed Energy System for Targeting of Asteroids and exploRation, is an orbiting stand-off system, which has been described in other papers. This paper describes a smaller, stand-on system known as DE-STARLITE as a reduced-scale version of DE-STAR. Both share the same basic heritage of a directed energy array that heats {{the surface of the}} target to the point of high surface vapor pressure that causes significant mass ejection thus forming an ejection plume of material from the target that acts as a rocket to deflect the object. This is generally classified as laser ablation. DE-STARLITE uses conventional propellant for launch to LEO and then ion engines to propel the spacecraft from LEO to the near-Earth asteroid (NEA). During laser ablation, the asteroid itself provides the propellant source material; thus a very modest spacecraft can deflect an asteroid much larger than would be possible with a system of similar mission mass using ion beam deflection (IBD) or a gravity tractor. DE- STARLITE is capable of deflecting an Apophis-class (325 m diameter) asteroid with a 1 - to 15 -year targeting time (laser on time) depending on the system design. The mission fits within the rough mission parameters of the Asteroid Redirect Mission (ARM) program in terms of mass and size. DE-STARLITE also has much greater capability for planetary defense than current proposals and is readily scalable to match the threat. It can deflect all known threats with sufficient warning.

40|$|Transurban {{spaces of}} {{consumption}} are a sub-category of the partly urban and partly rural space, {{for which the}} German urban planner and theoretician Thomas Sieverts in 1997 coined the term „Zwischenstadt“ translating in-between city or transurbia. Transurban spaces of consumption are a collective term comprising all architectonic and urbanistic implications on the built urban environment caused by the suburbanization of large-scale retail facilities. This fundamental study gives the first comprehensive and coherent account of transurban spaces formed by retail aggregations {{as seen from the}} point of view of architects and urban planners. The study bases on three columns represented by chronology, typology and field-studies. The chronology of transurban spaces of consumption traces the historic roots and the conditions under which these spaces developed in Germany over a period of over 60 years between 1945 and 2007. Considering retail-endogenous as well as retail-exogenous factors, it is stated, that the close spatial relationship between retail industry and the urban fabric has been partly lost. Thus mass consumption in the 20 th and the early 21 st century represents an important <b>deflecting</b> <b>force</b> of urban development. In the typology of transurban spaces of consumption eight prototypical retail centre types or location types are being defined and analysed according to their functional profiles and their position within the cityscape. These definitions of prototypes are complemented by reflections on their respective evolution and short case studies of built examples. The typology distinguishes between universal centre types, transgressive transurban centre types and structurally induced transurban centre or location types. Universal centre types can be operated irrespectively of their immediate urban or transurban surroundings. They are functioning in an inner-city setting as well as in a location in the periphery or in the open countryside. Shopping centres and urban entertainment centres belong to this first class. Transgressive transurban centre types emerged in transurbia but now setting out to slowly capture inner cities. This second class comprises power centres, corporate brandscapes and factory-outlet-centres. Structurally induced transurban centre or location types due to their land-take, range of goods and for reasons of profitability can only be successfully operated in transurban conditions. This applies for single- or multi-core agglomerations of large-scale retailers as well as automalls and single big-box markets situated in the periphery of cities. Detailed field studies have been carried out on selected objects, each highlighting and clarifying a respective prototype of transurban spaces of consumption. Perception-based analysis of these spaces focuses on context (politics, history, society), structure (architectural and urban space) and aesthetics (aesthetics of economy, aesthetics of usage, aesthetics of illusion). The field studies comprise the following examples: the Nova Eventis shopping centre near Leipzig, the factory-outlet-centre Wertheim Village, the corporate brandscape Autostadt Wolfsburg, three power centres in the Frankfurt Rhine-Main area, two large scale retail agglomerations in the Cologne / Bonn area and one Big-Box furniture store near Cologne. From these detailed analyses derives a criticism of transurban spaces of consumption, consisting of three main issues: 1. Reduction of urban complexity through negation of context, 2. Homogenization of transurban space and exclusion of non consumption conform modes of use and user groups, and 3. Substituting urbanity and diversity for fake-reality. It is concluded, that for the further urban and transurban development these critical matters of discussion mean that the perceived space of inner city and transurban environments becomes less and less distinguishable. Pseudo-urbanization of transurbia and transurbanization of inner city areas fostered by shopping malls and power centers will change the face of our cityscape. Therefore this study closes with an appeal to city-planners and architects alike to actively manage and shape the transurban spaces of consumption in the future. Finally, five central ideas for the future development of this category of space are formulated: cooperation, integration, hybridization, connectivity and design quality...|$|E
40|$|Higher-order laser modes are {{analyzed}} {{as a method}} to control focusing forces and improve the electron bunch quality in laser-plasma accelerators. In the linear wake regime, the focusing force {{is proportional to the}} transverse gradient of the laser intensity, which can be shaped by a superposition of modes. In particular, the transverse wakefield can be arbitrarily small in a region about the axis by adjusting the laser modes. Plasma channel effects, which prohibit the formation of the controlled-focusing region, can be mitigating by introducing a delay between the modes. Modes with parallel polarization produce a beat interference in the laser intensity, which lead to <b>deflecting</b> <b>forces.</b> This can be avoided by using modes with orthogonal polarization, different frequencies, or short pulses that do not overlap. Particle-in-cell simulations are performed of a laser-plasma accelerator in the quasilinear regime driven by high-order modes.
