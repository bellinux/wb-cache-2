40|$|International audienceUsing a user {{experience}} approach, we identified certain opportunities provided and limitations faced by cloud computing applications in remote meetings of design teams. Fifteen designers participated in six teams {{of three or}} four members during a one and a half hour meeting. They worked on a task involving the conceptual design of a Web page or a Corporate identity for a research laboratory. The meeting took place in a distributed manner, using two cloud applications. We identified some factors corresponding to favorable and unfavorable aspects perceived by designers when working in a cloud computing environment. After six interviews, data were open-coded to synthesize emergent themes, and then categorized by frequencies into five fields: opportunities, organization of work, limitations, needs for other materials and design process. The results indicate a positive experience regarding the interaction and the coauthoring production, which constitute an opportunity presented by cloud computing technologies. Web task designers prefer working under non-noise disturbance conditions and using a clear whiteboard, while with graphic tasks, designers generally prefer more sophisticated drawing tools and easy graphic modifications when creating sketching concepts. The {{participants in this study were}} globally satisfied with the social exchange climate, i. e., the graphical remote sharing that allows an effective exchange of <b>draft</b> <b>details</b> among multiple users on-line. The cloud environment already presents technical problems, such as lags or leaps during information exchange; limitations which have been seen to disrupt communication flow in the early conceptualization stage...|$|E

50|$|Congress often enacts {{statutes}} that grant broad rulemaking authority to federal agencies.

Therefore, federal agencies are authorized to promulgate regulations.

50|$|Geologist Clarence Dutton {{followed}} up on Powell's work in 1880-1881 with the first in-depth geological survey of the newly formed U.S. Geological Survey. Painters Thomas Moran and William Henry Holmes accompanied Dutton, who was busy <b>drafting</b> <b>detailed</b> descriptions of the area's geology. The report that resulted from the team's effort was titled A Tertiary History of The Grand Canyon District, with Atlas and was published in 1882. This and later study by geologists uncovered the geology of the Grand Canyon area and helped to advance that science. Both the Powell and Dutton expeditions helped to increase interest in the canyon and surrounding region.|$|R

5000|$|Milyutin's {{formative}} years were spent on his father's estate, Titovo, in Kaluga Oblast. Serfs worked the land at Titovo, while Milyutin's father occupied {{most of his}} time hunting and carousing with friends. Milyutin's mother was left to oversee most aspects of life on their estate. According to Milyutin, there were so many serfs at Titovo that [...] "to list all would be impossible." [...] While Milyutin largely omitted the more unsavory aspects regarding life at Titovo from his published memoirs, an unpublished <b>draft,</b> <b>detailing</b> his childhood, discusses the brutality with which his father treated his serfs. On one occasion Milyutin witnessed his father [...] "mercilessly" [...] flog one their serfs, as he later explained: [...] "But thus were the mores in those times: a good landowner considered flogging unavoidable to keep his serfs in line." [...] Afterwards, as was then common practice, the serf was made to come and [...] "thank the master" [...] for having administered his [...] "lesson." [...] The incident left an indelible impression on Milyutin's young mind.|$|R
