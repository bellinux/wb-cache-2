5|$|At that time, {{the only}} Finnish <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{producer}} Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab (SAT) {{was building a}} new factory in Karis, a location considered less likely than Helsinki to come under attack from Soviet air raids. Company general director Tor Nessling suggested the factory should be larger than originally planned. As another option, Nessling, with extreme reservation, considered building a new factory elsewhere in Finland. SAT was experienced in <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> production but economic and technical resources were limited. <b>Heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> importers and some political cliques thought SAT was trying {{to benefit from the}} war and to gain a dominant position in the Finnish market.|$|E

5|$|Both VAT and SAT were criticised in 1954 by <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> {{importers}} {{because the}} two companies had access to {{a large share of}} the limited foreign currency reserves for component supply. The importers' representatives said neither Sisu nor Vanaja were very domestic products and the vehicles the importers represented were actually more domestic because some assembly work was done in Finland. According to the Association of Vehicle Importers, the domestic vehicles cost between 30% and 80% more compared to imported ones. The following year, the government started to investigate possibilities for importing heavy vehicles in kit form to reduce foreign-currency expenditure. VAT and SAT expressed doubts about the viability of such production. In 1957, the government ended restrictions on the import of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> chassis. Eventually, the prices of imported vehicles approached those of Sisu and Vanaja vehicles.|$|E

Furthermore, a comprehensive comparison between <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> and passenger cars is presented. Freeways {{are designed to}} facilitate the flow of traffic including passenger cars and trucks. The impact of these different vehicle types is not uniform, creating problems in freeway operations and safety particularly under heavy demand with {{a high proportion of}} <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> There have been very few studies concerned with the traffic behavior and characteristics of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> in these situations. This study draws on extensive data collected over a long stretch of freeway using videotaping and surveys at several sites. The collected data were firstly used to study the interaction between <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> and passenger cars.

5|$|Speakers at {{the inquiry}} have also testified that a {{significant}} volume of city traffic regularly cut across the roof deck as a bypass of the traffic lights {{at the corner of}} Hillside Drive and Ontario Avenue, resulting in more stress on the structure than it had been designed to handle. The NORR report speculated that a <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> might have contributed to a previously undetected partial failure of the support structure a few months prior to the final collapse.|$|E
5|$|VAT {{fell into}} {{financial}} difficulties by {{end of the}} 1960s; {{this led to a}} merger with the other Finnish <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> producer Oy Suomen Autoteollisuus Ab at the end of 1968. The Vanaja brand ceased to exist in 1971, after which the former Vanaja factory produced Sisu terminal tractors, bus chassis, military vehicles and mobile crane chassis. The factory now belongs to Patriawhich produces Patria AMV armoured personnel carriersand heavy-vehicle axle producer Sisu Axles.|$|E
5|$|Gliders {{are often}} {{launched}} using a stationary ground-based winch {{mounted on a}} <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle.</b> This method is widely used at many European clubs, often {{in addition to an}} aerotow service. The engine is usually powered by LPG, petrol or diesel, though hydraulic fluid engines and electrical motors are also used. The winch pulls in a 1,000 to 2,500-metre (3,000 to 7,500ft) cable, made of high-tensile steel wire or a synthetic fiber, attached to the glider. The cable is released at a height of about 35% of the cable length after a short, steep ride. A strong headwind will result in higher launches.|$|E

A corrected method of calculating SULT considering <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> are presented. The method also introduce into basic saturation headways, locations of the <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> and the four types of headways. Field studies were implemented at 18 approaches of 6 intersections in Nanjing, China. The results show that the existence of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> has significant influence on both of headways and SULT at signalized intersection. Supplemental signal is effective countermeasure to reduce the influence of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The study will be helpful when measuring SULT at intersection with supplemental signal...|$|R

5|$|For {{extraordinary}} heroism {{while serving}} as a Leader of a Machine-Gun Section, Company C, 1st Battalion, 27th Marines, 5th Marine Division, in action against enemy Japanese forces on Iwo Jima in the Volcano Islands, 19 February 1945. Shrewdly gauging the tactical situation shortly after landing when his company's advance was held up by the concentrated fire of a heavily fortified Japanese blockhouse, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE boldly defied the smashing bombardment of heavy caliber fire to work {{his way around the}} flank and up to a position directly on top of the blockhouse and then, attacking with grenades and demolitions, single handedly destroyed the entire hostile strong point and its defending garrison. Consistently daring and aggressive as he fought his way over the battle-torn beach and up the sloping, gun-studded terraces toward Airfield Number 1, he repeatedly exposed himself to the blasting fury of exploding shells and later in the day coolly proceeded to the aid of a friendly tank which had been trapped in an enemy mine field under intense mortar and artillery barrages, skillfully guiding the <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> over the hazardous terrain to safety, despite the overwhelming volume of hostile fire. In the forefront of the assault at all times, he pushed forward with dauntless courage and iron determination until, moving upon the edge of the airfield, he fell, instantly killed by a bursting mortar shell. Stouthearted and indomitable, Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE, by his intrepid initiative, outstanding skill, and valiant spirit of self-sacrifice {{in the face of the}} fanatic opposition, contributed materially to the advance of his company during the early critical period of the assault, and his unwavering devotion to duty throughout the bitter conflict was an inspiration to his comrades and reflects the highest credit upon Gunnery Sergeant BASILONE and the United States Naval Service. He gallantly gave his life in the service of his country.|$|E

40|$|Due to its {{geometric}} design, turbo-roundabouts impose greatest constraints to the vehicular trajectories; by consequence, one {{can expect}} a more unfavourable impact of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> on the traffic conditions than on other types of roundabouts. The present paper addresses {{the question of how}} to estimate Passenger Car Equivalents (PCEs) for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> driving turbo-roundabouts. The microsimulation approach used revealed as a useful tool for evaluating the variation of quality of traffic in presence of mixed fleets (different percentages of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles).</b> Based on the output of multiple runs of several scenarios simulation, capacity functions for each entry lane of the turbo-roundabout were developed and variability of the PCEs for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> were calculated by comparing results for a fleet of passenger cars only with those of the mixed fleet scenarios. Results show a dependence of PCEs for <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> on operational conditions, which characterise the turbo-roundabout. Assuming the values of PCEs for roundabouts provided by the 2010 Highway Capacity Manual (HCM), depending on entering manoeuvring underestimation and overestimation of the effect of <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicles</b> on the quality of traffic conditions have been found...|$|R

25|$|Sometimes {{turbo lag}} is mistaken for engine speeds that are below boost {{threshold}}. If engine speed is below a turbocharger's boost threshold rpm then {{the time needed}} for the vehicle to build speed and rpm could be considerable, maybe even tens of seconds for a <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle</b> starting at low vehicle speed in a high gear. This wait for vehicle speed increase is not turbo lag, it is improper gear selection for boost demand. Once the vehicle reaches sufficient speed to provide the required rpm to reach boost threshold, {{there will be a}} far shorter delay while the turbo itself builds rotational energy and transitions to positive boost, only this last part of the delay in achieving positive boost is the turbo lag.|$|E

25|$|The MRAP {{may not be}} {{effective}} against Explosively Formed Penetrators (EFP), which use an explosive charge to propel a specially shaped metal plate at high velocity while simultaneously deforming it into an armor-piercing projectile. Use of EFPs in the Iraq war {{more than doubled in}} 2006, and as of 2007 was expected to continue to increase. In 2007, 11 percent of all roadside bomb fatalities were due to EFPs. In 2007, the Marines had estimated that the use of the MRAP could reduce casualties in Iraq due to IED attacks by as much as 80 percent. The MRAP weakness was addressed by the next-generation MRAPII. As an interim solution, the military installed a variant of the Humvee's IED defeating Frag Kit6 armor, which adds significant weight, as well as width to the already large and <b>heavy</b> <b>vehicle.</b> In July2008, the U.S. military reported the number of EFP attacks had dropped by 70 percent.|$|E
