40|$|After {{two decades}} of {{privatization}} and outsourcing being the dominant trends across public services, an inclination towards founding new municipal power utilities can be observed. In this article, the authors examine the preservation strategies of the German energy regime following the transition approach developed by Geels. From the multi-level perspective, it can be stated that innovations take place in niches and have to overcome the obstacles and persistence of the conventional fossil-nuclear energy regime. Through an empirical analysis, {{it can be concluded}} that the established regime significantly delays the decentralization process required for a transformation of energy structures on local electricity grids. Furthermore, it is shown that municipal utilities (Stadtwerke) are important key actors for the German Energiewende (energy transition) as they function as local <b>energy</b> <b>distributors</b> and they meet a variety of requirements to promote fundamental structural change. The trend towards re-municipalization and the re-establishment of municipal utilities reveal the desire to further strengthen the scope of local politics...|$|R

40|$|Energy is {{becoming}} a scarce good, although regenerative sources are growing. The main potential for future energy management is not first of all to generate more energy but to save energy by intelligent control wherever possible. The costs of smart control for energy saving are becoming smaller than the energy cost savings themeselves. An example for lighting, based on the efficiency of LEDs, even being already much more efficient than the „good old light bulb“, shows that intelligent control of light is feasible on smaller expense for customers than traditional illuminants with manual switches. The upcoming „Internet of Things“ will support smarter solutions that have not only more functionality, but also great benefit in costs. Low-cost sensors, energy harvesting, digital control, and even highest integration of power supplies will not be obstructive to provide energy saving based on growing intelligence of control. Decentralized control structures with local wireless communication, additionally to cloud computing and internet-based communication will provide increasing opportunities to attract energy customers to interact with energy providers and <b>energy</b> <b>distributors</b> for lower costs on all hands...|$|R

40|$|A {{number of}} Member States of the European Union (EU) have {{introduced}} market-based policy portfolios based on quantified energy savings obligations on <b>energy</b> <b>distributors</b> or suppliers, possibly coupled with certification of project-based energy savings (via white certificates), and {{the option to}} trade the certificates or obligations. The paper provides an up-to-date review and analysis of results to date of white certificate schemes in the EU. In the EU supplier obligations and white certificate schemes have delivered larger savings than originally expected with obliged companies exceeding targets and, in some cases, at cost below what policy makers have anticipated. Supplier obligations foster the uptake of standardised energy efficiency actions often targeting smaller energy users (residential sector), lowering the transaction costs and contributing to market transformation. The role of certificate trading is more ambiguous. Trading can bring benefits where the target is set sufficiently high {{with respect to the}} energy saving potential in the sectors covered. Theoretically trading may be better suited for broader systems with comprehensive coverage, but even in smaller schemes trading may reduce the transaction costs of compliance for obliged actors without sufficient expertise on end-use energy efficiency. Yet, trading increases the administrative cost ratio of energy saving obligations. JRC. DG. F. 8 -Renewable Energy (Ispra...|$|R
