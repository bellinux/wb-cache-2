5|$|Mattea {{is known}} for her roles in AIDS activism. In 1992, many {{televised}} awards shows were handing out red ribbons to participants in honor of AIDS awareness, but the Country Music Association chose to hand out green ribbons promoting <b>environmental</b> <b>awareness</b> instead. Mattea chose to wear three red ribbons that night, each one honoring {{a friend of hers}} who had died of the disease, along with the green ribbon. A 1994 article in the Chicago Tribune noted that a Nashville newspaper interprted a comment she had made on wearing both color ribbons as a confrontation, and that Mattea was often questioned as to whether her activism had a negative impact on sales of her then-current album. Besides her participation in the Red Hot + Country charity album series, Mattea also participated in charity concerts and made public appearances at activism campaigns. She was also the recipient of the inaugural Harvard AIDS Initiative award in 1994.|$|E
5|$|With the popularisation of {{the motor}} car, {{it was found that}} plowing alone was {{insufficient}} for removing all snow and ice from the roadway, leading to the development of gritting vehicles, which used sodium chloride to accelerate the melting of the snow. Early attempts at gritting were resisted, as the salt used encouraged rusting, causing damage to the metal structures of bridges and the shoes of pedestrians. However, as the number of motoring accidents increased, the protests subsided {{and by the end of}} the 1920s, many cities in the United States used salt and sand to clear the roads and increase road safety. As <b>environmental</b> <b>awareness</b> increased through the 1960s and 1970s, gritting once again came under criticism due to its environmental impact, leading to the development of alternative de-icing chemicals and more efficient spreading systems.|$|E

The Erie Art Museum also works on public art projects {{in an effort to}} revitalize and improve the city. In 2000, the Erie Art Museum created a project entitled GoFish, similar to CowParade. 95 fiberglass fish were decorated by Erie artists and placed throughout the city. Patrons paid $3,000 for a fish and the proceeds went to Gannon University's Scholarship Fund and the Erie Public Art Endowment Fund. The Erie Art Museum created a similar public art project in 2004 that involved frogs rather than fish. In 2012, the Erie Art Museum began a project to create forty artistic and functional bike racks, designed and created by local artists.

The study is carried out with a view to assessing the level of <b>environmental</b> professional <b>awareness</b> of climate change and coming up with a framework for climate change education. Findings of the study showed that majority of the respondents were not exposed to programmes and activities that could get them acquainted with current issues on climate change and as such they did not believe that they could abate the effects of climate change. The level of awareness of the respondents on climate change was not all that encouraging. Age and gender did not significantly influence <b>environmental</b> professionalâ€™s <b>awareness</b> of climate change. Based on these findings the paper suggested among others a framework for climate change education, based on the ideal contents, the tools and methods for such education as well as the networking that should exist among stakeholders...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: The {{study was}} carried out to assess the {{awareness}} of peoples {{on the impact of}} tannery waste disposal on environmental pollution of selected areas in Dhaka City. Data were collected by interviewing 300 peoples randomly of which 90 were labor, 60 livestock farmers, 60 fishermen and 90 were in local people in the study areas. Data were collected on age, education level, occupation, type of waste, color of waste, waste disposal time, environmental effect, human diseases, <b>environmental</b> pollution <b>awareness,</b> livestock diseases, livestock production and fisheries production. The findings revealed that about 34 % respondents were illiterate. Both solid and liquid waste (56 %) was come out from the tannery of which half of them were black in color. About 45 % respondents were reported that the most environmental effect was bad smell to the surrounding areas. Survey result also showed different health problems such as skin diseases, itch, rash, cough, fever, diarrhea, headache, asthma, dizziness etc due to unplanned tannery waste disposal. The highest proportion (38 %) of respondents had low <b>environmental</b> pollution <b>awareness</b> due to their education level. Livestock and poultry were died due to tannery waste indicated by 59 % respondents. The livestock and fish production was low, reported by 48 %. Education, occupation and type of waste had significant positive relationship where color of waste had no relationship with their <b>environmental</b> pollution <b>awareness.</b> The results of this study will be helpful to create peopleâ€™s <b>awareness</b> on <b>environmental</b> pollution and their impact by tannery waste disposal...|$|R

40|$|<b>Environmental</b> print <b>awareness</b> {{refers to}} the stage of {{literacy}} development when children recognize familiar symbols and words, and display understanding and knowledge that print carries meaning. It {{has been well documented}} in literature that <b>environmental</b> print <b>awareness</b> influences the development of early literacy skills. This study was conducted to understand the development of <b>environmental</b> print <b>awareness</b> in kindergarten children. Thirty-eight typically developing Tamil speaking children enrolled in a English medium school and belonging to middle socioeconomic status, were followed from LKG to first grade. They were presented with 15 logos in English and 15 logos in Tamil as they appear in the environment. The 15 logos in each language belonged to three categories: child related, home related and community related. The children were presented with these stimuli every six months and their responses were recorded. Correct responses were given a score of 1 and wrong responses/ no responses were given a score of 0. The scores were analysed to look for a developmental trend in the <b>awareness</b> of <b>environmental</b> print. Results revealed that, across all the readings, children recognized child related logos best, followed by home related and then community related logos. In LKG, fewer logos were recognized and there were no differences in the recognition of English as compared to Tamil. In UKG and grade 1, more numbers of logos were recognized and English logos were recognized better than Tamil. The findings of this study have implications in creating literacy rich environments for children at home and school...|$|R
