40|$|Inaugural lecture [...] Department of Electrical Engineering, Rand Afrikaans University, 18 September 1974 Today's {{industry}} and communications systems, in fact modern {{life as we}} know it, could come to a standstill without electronics. The defensive system of a country would be affected similarly, as can be illustrated by citing examples of the use made of electronics in modern defence. Wireless communication receivers of the synthesizer type permit rapid tuning to a transmitter station and are particularly useful for electronic intelligence. They are, however, complex, consisting of numerous components. The application of microcircuits, especially monolithic integrated circuits, makes it possible to construct small compact and reliable equipment, whilst thin film microcircuits can best be used for high-frequency and highspeed requirements. In the design of more deadly artillery shells, use is made of the Doppler effect, whilst new radar equipment is improved by ultrasonic surface wave devices. Modern warfare necessitates frequent replacement of electronic equipment, the cost of which may exceed that {{of the rest of the}} aircraft or ship. A modern war may be won or lost in <b>industrial</b> laboratories. <b>Co-operation</b> between electrical engineers and physicists is essential. The ultimate factor in modern warfare still remains the determination of its soldiers to defend their country and to accept the sacrifices necessary...|$|R

He {{served as a}} junior minister of aviation, where {{he was involved in}} BOAC's order of Boeing 707 aircraft from the US, against his own recommendation that they should buy a British aircraft, the Super VC10. This led to his making accusations against colleagues about the reasons for the decision. In March 1968 he negotiated an agreement providing a framework for the long-term development of technological co-operation between Britain and Czechoslovakia.

40|$|A close {{examination}} of the organisation of the clothing industry in Thailand exhibits a rather paradoxical situation: although the structural features of the sector - the breaking down of the production process, high labour intensity, low asset specificity, low skilled labour - seem to legitimate a market co-ordination mechanism, it is a close, durable and multiform co-operation which cements, in Thailand, the relations between contractors and subcontractors, {{as well as between}} subcontractors themselves. We defend the idea that this kind of co-operative organisation of economic activities represents an appropriate answer to the flexibility required by ever changing markets. Co-operation is here understood as a mechanism of temporal co-ordination of economic activities which, far from substituting itself to the market co-ordination mechanism, rather completes it.

40|$|The {{presentation}} will briefly {{present the}} state-of-the-art of image based measurement techniques for aerodynamic research in industrial wind tunnels, report on co-operation on fundamentals of such measurement techniques with academic partners in Russia and describe some observations made during these co-operations. DLR utilizes image based measurement techniques as mobile systems {{for use in}} industrial wind tunnels. The techniques of main interest are Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) for investigation of unsteady flow fields, Pressure Sensitive Paint (PSP) for determination {{of pressure on the}} complete surface of a wind tunnel model, model deformation measurement techniques, in order to know the exact location and shape of a model under wind load, and Background Oriented Schlieren (BOS) for quantitative investigation of density objects. Some of these techniques such as PSP have been first developed in Russia or are under current development (e. g. BOS) at Russian universities. DLR’s interest rather being directed to the adaptation of advanced measurement techniques for industrial wind tunnels and applying them for <b>industrial</b> projects <b>co-operation</b> with academic partners in Russia rather working on the fundamental aspects of such techniques has been established during the past few years. In detail the Department of Experimental Methods of the Institute of Aerodynamics and Flow Technology has co-ordinated an INTAS project, will host two INTAS Young Scientists, co-operates in a DLR-funded project on assessment of velocity measurement techniques as developed by Russian partners and will co-ordinate a STREP including a Russian university partner. During the initial phase of DLR’s PSP development also some co-operation with Russian researchers took place. Taking into account observations made during these different co-operation projects, some ideas concerning future co-operation on the development of measurement techniques in a bottom-up approach will be presented for discussion. ...|$|R

40|$|Regional {{development}} in a knowledge-based economy to a higher degree than in a traditional <b>industrial</b> society requires <b>co-operation</b> between (i) industry and trade, (ii) knowledge centres such as universities, and (iii) government bodies on different levels. A knowledge-based economy thus involves new challenges for regional development. For peripheral regions at the outskirts of an integrated European economy, overcoming spatial disadvantages adds {{to the list of}} challenges for actors involved in regional development. Established theoretical wisdom, however, seem to have difficulties in providing guidance and advice how to achieve favourable conditions for a dynamic development of such regions. This has fostered an interest in ‘bench-learning', i. e. learning from regions that seem to ‘have made it' regardless of geographical disabilities. This article applies a Triple Helix perspective on the development of two Nordic regions: the Luleå region in Sweden and the Oulu region in Finland. The article discusses how the {{development in}} these two regions may be understood from a Triple Helix perspective. The article concludes with a discussion on the prospects to develop Triple Helix co-operation in Northwest Russia, specifically pinpointing the need to build trust among key actors in the economy.

40|$|The Technology Report of 1999 takes {{stock of}} current {{technological}} performance in Austria. The Report includes {{evaluations of the}} Community Innovation Survey (CIS) on research, development and innovation in business, {{as well as several}} supplementary analyses on the formation of new companies, <b>co-operations,</b> <b>industrial</b> specialisation rates and the scientific system. Recent studies of R&D activities show that the funding assigned to R&D continues to be stagnant and is lower than the country's economic power would warrant. An above-average share of financing for research comes from the public sector. The lagging expenditure on R&D is largely the result of the structure of Austrian industries. External sources of technological knowledge such as purchased materials and services and capital goods contribute much of the total R&D content of products and services. In terms of innovation, Austria has an above-average number of innovators but spends less on innovation in general. Austrian companies typically pursue a strategy of incremental innovation, i. e., continuous improvement of products and processes. An analysis of the industrial structure based on the new WIFO classification confirms the findings of former studies – a technology gap as the consequence of the prevailing industrial structure. Austrian manufacturing operates mainly in traditional sectors of average to low technological level. Newly formed companies currently fail to trigger any sustained drive towards a greater technological focus. Austria is moving towards a knowledge-based economy. Evidence for this comes from a growing diffusion of information and communication technologies, greater internationalisation of research, and more readiness of universities and companies to join European co-operative ventures. Future technology policies will find it necessary to concentrate more on existing structural faults (e. g., the specialisation patterns in industry) and develop an institutional framework for implementing long-term strategies. tip-related publications; Technologie und Innovation in der wissensbasierten Ökonomie.

Considerable knowledge base and experience is available, appropriate policies and financial incentives are in place, dedicated organisations are established to address the technological and industrial issues. Germany currently has a market promoting biomethane utilisation via CHP applications. Further growth can be expected by addressing increased resource mobilisation for fulfilling a larger share of heat demand and application as renewable transport fuel. Biomethane industry in UK is in its nascent stages and there are two upgrading plants in operation. Analysis of the system functions within UK, signals a healthy biogas industry, but there is lack of activity within the "biomethane" context. Currently, the industry is in the stage of knowledge development. Biomethane production is well communicated within national strategies. The key technical issues being encountered by the industry are a focus of research. A balanced market formation would require increasing the resource mobilisation in terms of availability of skilled manpower as well as ease of access to financial capital. The industry is currently experiencing pilot trials and subsequent dissemination of information of the results of these trials to the stakeholders in the value chain is recommended.

40|$|Background to {{the study}} Sustaining Progress (2003), the sixth {{national}} agreement {{between the government and}} the social partners, states that public service pay increases are ‘…dependent, in the case of each sector, organisation and grade, on verification of satisfactory achievement of the provisions on cooperation with flexibility and ongoing change; satisfactory implementation of the agenda for modernisation…and the maintenance of stable industrial relations and the absence of industrial action…’ (para. 26. 1). To provide the verification required above, Performance Verification Groups (PVGs) were established for the main sectors of the public service, namely the civil service, local government, health, education, and justice and equality sectors. PVGs have independent chairs and equal numbers of management, union and independent members. PVGs make recommendations on whether or not pay increases are merited based primarily on an assessment of progress reports submitted by participating organisations. This review of performance verification assesses the usefulness of the PVG mechanism as a means of achieving flexibility and change within individual organisations. The review also suggests improvements that can be made to the performance verification process. In carrying out the study, interviews were held with the sectoral PVG chairs and most of the individual members of the PVGs. Interviews also took place with the sectoral PVG secretariats and the departmental secretaries general with responsibility for the sectoral PVG reports. A short questionnaire was sent to public service organisations and bodies involved in the performance verification process in each sector (approximately 120 organisations and bodies). A response rate of 64 per cent was achieved overall. What impact has performance verification had? A full assessment of the impact of performance verification is not possible within the scope of this study, as at the time of writing, the final two pay increases under Sustaining Progress have not been verified. However, it is possible to give a broad picture of the effect to date of performance verification on pay determination and on industrial stability, flexibility, change, and public service modernisation. Performance verification and public service pay In the vast majority of cases, the judgement of the PVGs to date has been that progress has been satisfactory enough to merit payment of the increases. However, there have been a number of instances across all the sectors where the recommendation has been that payment should not be awarded at the time of the assessment or where the PVG has held off making a recommendation pending further industrial relations discussions. In several instances, the citing of an organisation or grade by the secretary general in his/her sectoral overview report has led to the issue being resolved before a recommendation of the PVG is made Performance verification and industrial relations stability According to PVG members and a significant majority of questionnaire responses, one of the most significant benefits of performance verification has been the contribution it has made to industrial peace. Linking payment of all of the Sustaining Progress agreed payments and 75 per cent of benchmarking payments to the absence of industrial action and the absence of a threat of industrial action is seen as instrumental in achieving a high level of industrial peace. A particular industrial relations benefit of the performance verification process is that it is seen as acting as an incentive to sort out problems ‘below the radar’. Where the potential for disputes arise, the strict timetable for payment in the agreement acts as an incentive for management and unions to get together, either informally or formally through the established industrial relations procedures underpinning Sustaining Progress, to sort out the situation before the sectoral PVG has to make a judgement on the issue. Performance verification and public service modernisation Clearly, it is not possible to directly attribute all change that has taken place in the public service in recent times to performance verification. The extent to which the changes and modernisation initiatives that have occurred would have happened anyway is open to question in the absence of evidence to the contrary. But the majority view of respondents is that performance verification has had an impact in terms of making things happen to a deadline, driven by the dates for the pay increases. If change would have happened anyway, the view is that it would have tended to be slower and less comprehensive. Also, the process is seen as keeping items on the agenda of organisations that might have slipped off in the face of new and emerging priorities. While the vast majority of responses are positive with regard to the impact of performance verification, not all are. The limited ambition of the modernisation agenda was cited by a number of respondents, including many who are positively disposed towards performance verification. There is a view here that the overall agenda of change is not challenging or radical in nature, but rather represents incremental, small-scale change. The scope and range of the public service modernisation agenda is a wider issue than performance verification, as it is established in the context of the social partnership negotiations with verification following on. But it is an important issue for consideration in the context of future developments. Many respondents and interviewees are in favour of a modernisation agenda that allows priority to be given at organisational level to a few key issues being addressed. Linked to the issue of the modernisation agenda, several respondents, particularly on the management side, note that the change agenda outlined in Sustaining Progress is fixed at a point in time and that significant change may subsequently arise that cannot be addressed in the verification process as it is not covered in Sustaining Progress. There is a view that the performance verification process should be flexible enough to respond to major change initiatives not envisaged at the time of the agreement. Performance verification and the public demonstration of change There is some concern among public servants that critical media comments of the public service, and in particular of the pay increases awarded under the benchmarking process, are seen as receiving attention while positive developments are passed over. There are also issues around public accountability and transparency of the performance verification process. In this context, there are a number of aspects to the public demonstration of performance verification. Many of the respondents and interviewees comment positively on the opportunity performance verification gives to present information in a structured way to the political process. Similarly, members of the general public directly affected by service delivery changes such as extended opening hours or reduced time in processing claims can see a difference as a result of actions taken. But in terms of the media and general public forming a view on the impact of performance verification, this is where there is little engagement with the process. A number of reasons are put forward for this limited public engagement with performance verification. One is that much of the public service modernisation agenda focuses on internal efficiency-oriented changes to public service organisations, and while these may ultimately impact on citizens, their direct impact is difficult to discern. Also, the sheer volume of paper produced is seen as daunting and off-putting to anyone from outside the system wanting to see what is happening. In this context, the main public source of information on performance verification is the websites of the sectoral PVGs. These websites can be difficult to find, and once there, making sense of the volume of material can be challenging. Improving the performance verification process The evidence from the interviews, questionnaires and documentation studied is that the performance verification process has had a positive impact on <b>industrial</b> relations stability, <b>co-operation</b> with flexibility and change, and implementation of the public service modernisation agenda. When compared with arrangements outlined in previous national agreements, performance verification has led to more rigorous implementation and scrutiny of public service change programmes. But the performance verification process is not without its limitations. Criticism has been made of the limited scope of the modernisation agenda. The actual performance verification process itself has generated a vast amount of paper work, the value of much of which has been questioned by many participants. Virtually all interviewees and questionnaire respondents highlight the large amount of paper that the process generates. The amount of information produced in action plans and progress reports is voluminous. Comments on these plans and reports see a need to reduce the paper burden as a key concern. While there is widespread support for the continuation of performance verification in any future national agreement covering pay increases in the public service, there is also a need to change and simplify the process. A number of recommendations are made in the report aimed at improving the performance verification process in the future. Details about the reasoning behind the recommendations are contained in the main body of the report. The recommendations are grouped under three main headings: (a) contextual issues that need to be addressed within the framework of any future national agreements, (b) issues around the structures and processes of performance verification, and (c) issues concerning the outputs of performance verification.
