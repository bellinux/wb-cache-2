5|$|The Blitz game mode was {{the result}} of experimenting with ideas for a fast-paced and {{accessible}} variation of RTS gameplay. The development team wanted to streamline mechanics, such as base building and resource management, that players typically viewed as being complex and intimidating. The initial design of Blitz involved players having an army roster, like in tabletop war games. After playtesting this version, they realized that the scale of battles would shrink and become less appealing {{over the course of the}} match. They revised the mode by implementing a card-and-deck system for unit deployment and introducing randomly spawning resources on the maps. Blitz was influenced by the Warzone game mode from Halo 5: Guardians and Blizzard Entertainment's collectible card game <b>Hearthstone,</b> taking design cues from the card collecting and deck building systems. 343 Industries' head of strategy games Dan Ayoub cited the multiplayer online battle arena genre as impactful on the design of Blitz, since games in the genre replaced resource management with individual unit combat.|$|E

In March 2017, <b>Hearthstone</b> was still the fourth-most watched game while nearly matching Dota 2s hours.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hearthstone,</b> {{originally}} {{known as}} Hearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft, is a free-to-play online collectible card video game developed {{and published by}} Blizzard Entertainment. Having been released worldwide on March 11, 2014, <b>Hearthstone</b> builds upon the already existing lore of the Warcraft series by using the same elements, characters, and relics. It was first released for Microsoft Windows and macOS, with support for iOS and Android devices being added later. The game features cross-platform play, allowing players on any device to compete with each other, restricted only by geographical region account limits.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to new cards and mechanics, Blizzard has also worked to add new features to <b>Hearthstone</b> itself. The Tavern Brawl mode was in development {{for over a}} year before it was released in June 2015; the feature went through many iterations before the team was satisfied. Dodds equated the Tavern Brawl mode as a place to try experimental mechanics that may later be introduced to the game, as well as to offer gameplay that varies significantly from other areas of play within <b>Hearthstone.</b> Blizzard experimented with cross-platform play during development, having successfully played a game on PC against a player using an iPad; however, it was not a feature at launch. Cross-platform play was added in April 2014.|$|E
50|$|The {{remains of}} several hearths {{have been found}} at Broken Mammoth with the {{radiocarbon}} dating of the charcoal providing sound evidence for {{the age of the}} site. A shallow pit hearth feature was excavated with a radiocarbon date of approximately 4524 years ago and is associated with several flakes and obsidian microblades. This hearth demonstrates that there was some occupation near the bluffâ€™s edge at the site. A second hearth radiocarbon dated to about 7,600 years ago has evidence of <b>hearthstones,</b> suggesting occupation {{for an extended period of}} time. Two more and (possibly a third) hearths, radio carbon dated from 9,690 years ago; 10,270 years ago; and 10,790 years ago respectively, have been found at the site clearly associated with <b>hearthstones</b> with lithics and the remains of fauna excavated around them. This indicates the occupants stayed at this site for some time, long enough to use the hearths multiple times.|$|R

25|$|The {{game has}} been favorably {{reviewed}} by critics and is financially successful for Blizzard, making {{as much as}} $40 million per month as of August 2017. , Blizzard has reported more than 70 million <b>Hearthstone</b> players. The game has become popular as an eSport, with cash prize tournaments hosted by Blizzard and other organizers.|$|E
25|$|Internal {{beta testing}} of the game within Blizzard began in 2012. A closed beta was {{launched}} in August 2013, while the game was put into open beta in January 2014. These beta testing periods were {{used to evaluate the}} game's balance, adjusting cards they found to be too powerful or too weak, and making sure no single Hero or deck type dominated the game. As they approached the game's release in March 2014, Blizzard found that it was hard to generate interest in getting people to try the game, believing that once they tried it they would be drawn into the game; those they asked to try the game felt that <b>Hearthstone</b> wasn't the type of game they would be interested in playing. At this point, Blizzard opted to make <b>Hearthstone</b> free to play supported by microtransactions for less patient players. This helped to significantly boost the game's popularity on release.|$|E

On the evidence of <b>hearthstones</b> and material cultures, Malez found the presence of the early man Homo Erectus in the Å andalja cave dated to approximately 900,000 years of age.|$|R
50|$|Paneled wainscoting is on {{the lower}} walls, with lath and plaster {{finishing}} above and on the ceiling. The deeply recessed windows reveal {{the width of the}} walls. Both parlors have fireplaces with Federal style wooden mantels with a five-part entablature, beveled panels and bulbous colonettes on the front one. The rear substitutes a molded frieze for the colonettes but has a similar five-part structure. The <b>hearthstones</b> are red sandstone similar to the exterior; the floors are thin width oak.|$|R
25|$|Other {{aspects of}} the game's {{interface}} were set to replicate {{the feel of a}} physical game being watched by an audience: <b>Hearthstone</b> starts with the player opening a box, during gameplay the cards waver and move while in their hand, and cards when played slam down on the board. When attacking, cards leap across the board to strike the target; when a massive spike of damage is dealt, the board shakes; when a massive creature is summoned, an unseen audience gasps in awe. <b>Hearthstone</b> also offers interactive boards. The boards on which the cards are played can be interacted with in various ways, such as virtually petting a dragon, although the feature is purely for entertainment and has no effect on gameplay. This idea came out from the movie Jumanji in which a board game comes to life, and also mimics how physical card players would often toy with their cards while waiting on their opponent.|$|E
25|$|<b>Hearthstone</b> is set {{within the}} Warcraft universe, with its characters, spells and {{locations}} drawing from existing lore. Each player {{is represented by}} a 'hero', a character from Warcraft lore representing one of nine specific classes. The classes are defined by their unique hero power {{that can be used}} during a player's turn, and the selection of class-specific cards that the player uses to construct the hero's deck.|$|E

5000|$|The triple-temple {{form of the}} triadic pyramid {{appears to}} be related to Maya mythology. According to one theory, the three <b>hearthstones</b> of the Maya {{creation}} myth can be associated with three stars in the constellation of Orion and the triadic pyramid complex may be an architectural representation of this. New studies favor an alternative interpretation, according to which the Triadic Groups may represent the moment of resurrection of the Maya maize god {{on the top of the}} Flower Mountain, accompanied by two other deities.|$|R
50|$|The Vogel Bay {{site has}} {{historical}} significance because the Potawatomi Indian West Shore Trail {{passed through the}} area. At {{the head of this}} bay <b>hearthstones</b> and a few flint chips were found in the rear of a small cottage in a spot from which the sod had recently been removed. Others were found on the adjoining cultivated field of the Vogel farm. At least one Indian wigwam was at some time located here. A few flint points and a chert pecking hammer have been picked up in this field.|$|R
25|$|The Battle.net Launcher {{was officially}} renamed to Blizzard App in March 2017, {{as part of}} a {{rebranding}} effort to retire the Battle.net name; however, Blizzard later reversed this in August 2017, and opted to use the merged name Blizzard Battle.net. The app currently supports storefront actions, social interactions, and matchmaking for all of Blizzard's current games including Heroes of the Storm, <b>Hearthstone,</b> Overwatch, and , as well as Destiny 2 from its corporate sibling Activision.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the game}} types they explored, Team 5 soon {{focused on the}} {{collectible}} card game approach, given that many on the team and in Blizzard had played such games since their introduction. The team found it natural to build the card game around the existing Warcraft lore; according to production director Jason Chayes, Warcraft was already a well-known property, {{and the depth of}} characters and locations created for other games in that series made it easy to create cards inspired by those. They also saw that new players to Warcraft may be drawn into the other games through playing <b>Hearthstone.</b> The team was able to pull concepts and art from the pre-existing World of Warcraft Trading Card Game, first published in 2006 by Upper Deck and later by Cryptozoic Entertainment; when <b>Hearthstone</b> was near completion, in 2013, Blizzard terminated its license with Cryptozoic as to favor their pending digital card game. The addition of heroes, an aspect from the previous trading card game, was found to help personalize the game for the player to allow players to discover useful combinations of cards for each hero.|$|E
25|$|In {{contrast}} to other games developed by Blizzard, <b>Hearthstone</b> was an experimental game {{developed by a}} smaller team based on the appreciation of collectible card games at the company. The game was designed to avoid pitfalls of other digital collectible card games by eliminating any possible plays from an opponent during a player's turn and by replicating {{the feel of a}} physical card game within the game's user interface. Many of the concepts as well as art assets were based on those previously published in the physical World of Warcraft Trading Card Game.|$|E
50|$|<b>Hearthstones</b> third adventure, League of Explorers, was {{announced}} on November 6, 2015, which was later released on November 12.

The expansion World of Warcraft: Legion released its cinematic trailer and announced a release date on or before September 21, 2016 and was playable. The Warcraft (film) released its first official trailer and revealed its release date of June 10, 2016. StarCraft II was announced to have upcoming single player mission packs, Nova Covert Ops, which each consist of three missions.|$|R
50|$|Zone one (7500-6500 BCE), {{starting}} from the top, included two strata {{near the front of}} the shelter. It consisted of limestone that was 1 to 24 in thick. However, towards the back of the shelter, zone one contained a third stratum that was distinguished by a sterile line of deposits. Zone one contained some fire-cracked <b>hearthstones,</b> large flint debris, rodent bones, some cracked deer bone, and near the middle of the cave, late Paleo-Indian points were recovered. Units 6, 9, 10, and 14 in zone one, contained a higher level of charcoal, some fine and some in lumps.|$|R
5000|$|Field {{spent the}} 1920s {{summering}} on Sutton Island, part of Cranberry Isles, Maine.According to Margaret Lane, [...] "The inspiration for Calico Bush probably {{came from the}} story of Marguerite La Croix, who with her husband, John Stanley, moved from Marblehead after 1767, with their many children {{and became the first}} permanent residents of Little Cranberry Island. Just north of the 'Head' their <b>hearthstones</b> still lie undisturbed in the field, and they themselves are buried on Maypole Point." [...] Field did not try to tell the woman's story exactly, but used her as inspiration for her book.|$|R
