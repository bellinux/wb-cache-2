5|$|All five {{versions}} of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars. All versions, except that in the Gesta Francorum, generally agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society {{and the necessity of}} maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking. They do not all specifically mention Jerusalem as the ultimate goal. However, {{it has been argued that}} Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along. According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of Deus vult! ("God wills it!"). However, other {{versions of}} the speech do not include this detail.|$|E

5|$|As a child, Juha Vainio loved {{singing and}} the family's {{neighbours}} often {{asked him to}} come over and perform. When the Winter War started in 1939, Juha was too young to understand events. After his father went to war as a captain of the military reserve force, Juha moved with his mother to Metsola, Kotka. As an adult, the only thing Juha Vainio remembered from the war were the air-raid sirens and people's anxiety. He once said that he was more afraid of the women next door than the war, {{but on the other hand}} admitted that the war left him with emotional scars. His song Eräänlainen sotaveteraani ("Some <b>Kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>War</b> Veteran"), on the album Sellaista elämä on ("That's How Life Is"), echoes these sentiments. Because Kotka was a harbour town and often bombed, Juha and his mother had to often evacuate. Sometimes they went to stay at her mother's cousins during the evacuations where Juha became friends with Olli Miettinen, a cousin of his mother. The two had an age difference of six years. The only brother of Kaarina Vainio, Mauno, was killed in the war.|$|E
5|$|To some extent, the {{difficulties}} both Gebhard and Ernst faced {{in winning the}} war were the same the Spanish had in subduing the Dutch Revolt. The protraction of the Spanish and Dutch war—80 years of bitter fighting interrupted by periodic truces while both sides gathered resources—lay in the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> it was: Enemies lived in fortified towns defended by Italian-style bastions, which meant the towns {{had to be taken}} and then fortified and maintained. For both Gebhard and Ernst, as for the Spanish commanders in the nearby Lowlands, winning the war meant not only mobilizing enough men to encircle a seemingly endless cycle of enemy artillery fortresses, but also maintaining the army one had and defending all one's own possessions as they were acquired. The Cologne War, similar to the Dutch Revolt in that respect, was also a war of sieges, not of assembled armies facing one another on the field of battle, nor of maneuver, feint, and parry that characterized wars two centuries earlier and later. These wars required men who could operate the machinery of war, which meant extensive economic resources for soldiers to build and operate the siege works, and a political and military will to keep the machinery of war operating. The Spanish faced another problem, distance, which gave them a distinct interest in intervening in the Cologne affair: the Electorate lay on the Rhine River, and the Spanish road.|$|E
25|$|When North Vietnam invaded in March 1975, {{the promised}} American {{intervention}} never materialized. Congress reflected the popular mood, halting {{the bombing in}} Cambodia effective 15 July 1973, and reducing aid to South Vietnam. Since Thieu intended to fight the same <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> he always had, with lavish use of firepower, the cuts in aid proved especially damaging.|$|E

25|$|This book {{is about}} four {{children}} whose names were Ann, Martin, Rose and Peter. But it is most about Peter who was the youngest. They all had to go away from London suddenly because of Air Raids, and because Father, {{who was in the}} Army, had gone off to the War and Mother was doing some <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> work. They were sent to stay with a kind of relation of Mother's who was a very old professor who lived all by himself in the country.|$|E
25|$|Westmoreland was {{convinced}} that the Vietnamese communists could be destroyed by fighting a war of attrition that, theoretically, would render the Vietnam People's Army unable to fight. His war strategy was marked by heavy use of artillery and airpower and repeated attempts to engage the communists in large-unit battles, and thereby exploit the US's vastly superior firepower and technology. However, the North Vietnamese Army (NVA) and the National Liberation Front of South Vietnam (NLF) were able to dictate the pace of attrition to fit their own goals: by continuing to fight a guerrilla war and avoiding large-unit battles, they denied the Americans the chance to fight the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> they were best at, and they ensured that attrition would wear down the American public's support for the war faster than they.|$|E

The court concluded that other crimes, outside Srebrenica, committed during the 1992-1995 war, may amount to crimes against humanity according to the international law, but that these acts did not, in themselves, constitute genocide per se.|$|R
50|$|During the Winter War and Continuation War , the Military Museum {{organized}} {{a series of}} exhibitions at the Exhibition Hall. The first was Sotasaalisnäyttely (War Looting Exhibition) in February 1940 which was shortly followed by the Sotamuistonäyttely (War Memories Exhibition) I and II in 1941. Military Museum also organized touring exhibitions around Finland between 1941 and 1943 and even had exhibitions in Sweden in 1942-43. There were several purposes for these <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> exhibitions. It was, for example, a means to gather funds for war invalids and their families, to show how it was to fight on Finnish side at the front, and to lift up morale among citizens.|$|R
50|$|There {{were two}} <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> Reichskrieg with two {{different}} legal bases. The {{first was a}} Reichsexekutionskrieg, a military action of the empire against {{one of its own}} Imperial Estates (Reichstände). This could only be done after one of the empire's two supreme courts, the Imperial Chamber Court or the Imperial Aulic Council, had found the offending estate to be in breach of the peace, and the estate was too powerful to be subdued by the Imperial Circle to which it belonged. The second <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> Reichskrieg was that against an another sovereign state that had violated the empire's rights or frontiers. After 1519, the emperors were bound to get the support of the Imperial Electors prior to declaring war on another state. From 1648, they required the approval of the diet for both <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b>|$|R
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the 19th century the peripheral systemat least in Swedenwas deemed unmodern, due to the extremely long border and coastline of the country, which required a lot of personnel to maintain and support, leading to high costs and a neglectance of the more mobile armed forces. The peripheral system was also meant to contain the enemy to a specific area, the coast and borders, but as time went and new tactics were taken into practice, the thin line of fortifications would be easily penetrated by the enemy forces, and when the enemy had advanced through the peripheral line, there would not be enough troops in the hinterland to stop the attacker. The central fortress system was better adjusted to defence in depth, {{it was not until the}} enemy attack had reached its culminating point that full counter-attacks would be launched. The central defence had also proven effective in the Seven Years' Warused by Frederick II of Prussiaand in Napoleon's Invasion of Russiaused by the Russians. Carl von Clausewitz, in his military treatise On War, even mentioned Sweden's good conditions for this <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> of attrition: ...|$|E
500|$|Further, Basinger {{considers}} Bataan {{to provide}} a definition-by-example of [...] "the World War II combat film", in which a diverse and apparently unsuited group of [...] "hastily assembled volunteers" [...] hold off a much larger group of the enemy through their [...] "bravery and tenacity". She argues that the combat film is not a subgenre but the only genuine <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> film. Since she notes that there were in fact only five true combat films made during the Second World War, in her view these few films, central to the genre, are outweighed by the many other films that lie {{on the margins of}} being war films. However, other critics such as Russell Earl Shain propose a far broader definition of war film, to include films that deal [...] "with the roles of civilians, espionage agents, and soldiers in any of the aspects of war (i.e. preparation, cause, prevention, conduct, daily life, and consequences or aftermath.)" [...] Neale points out that genres overlap, with combat scenes for different purposes in other types of film, and suggests that war films are characterised by combat which [...] "determines the fate of the principal characters". This in turn pushes combat scenes to the climactic ends of war films. Not all critics agree, either, that war films must be about 20th century wars. James Clarke includes Edward Zwick's Oscar-winning Glory (1990) among the war films he discusses in detail; it is set in the American Civil War, and he lists six other films about that war which he considers [...] "notable".|$|E
2500|$|Professor Fouad Ajami wrote: This {{is a long}} {{twilight}} war, {{the struggle}} against radical Islamism. We can't wish it away.

These men of nowhere—Faisal Shahzad, Nidal Malik Hasan, the American-born renegade cleric Anwar Awlaki now holed up in Yemen and their likes—are a deadly breed of combatants in this new <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> Modernity both attracts and unsettles them.

5000|$|Stephen Holden, {{film critic}} for The New York Times, liked {{the motion picture}} and called it a [...] "visually {{sweeping}} film", and believed the drama's anti-war sentiments were high-minded. He wrote, [...] "If the film's sentiments about the madness <b>of</b> <b>war</b> are impeccably high-minded, why then does Joyeux Noël ...feel as squishy and vague as a handsome greeting card declaring peace on earth? Maybe it's because the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> being fought {{in the 21st century}} involve religious, ideological and economic differences that go much deeper and feel more resistant to resolution than the European territorial disputes and power struggles that precipitated World War I... Another reason is that the movie's cross-section of soldiers from France, Scotland and Germany are so scrupulously depicted as equal-opportunity peacemakers that they never come fully to life as individuals." ...|$|R

It is offensive to be boxed into a “civilization” and to be told that you are the same as the people confined to the same box, and that you are sufficiently different from the people confined to other boxes for there to be confrontations between you. For the past 25 years, Huntington's thesis has encouraged an expansionist foreign policy which has produced just the <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>wars</b> it purports to explain...|$|R
2500|$|Following {{the death}} of the Marquis de Montcalm and the fall of Québec on 18 September – after the colonel's aborted attempt to {{resupply}} the besieged city – Bougainville was dispatched to the western front by his new commanding officer, the Chevalier de Lévis. He attempted to stop the British advance from his entrenchments at Île-aux-Noix. He was among the officers who accompanied Lévis to Saint Helen's Island off Montreal for the last French stand in North America before the general capitulation of 1761.

2500|$|Like many {{liberals and}} socialists, Rustin {{supported}} President Lyndon B. Johnson's containment policy against communism, while criticizing specific conduct of this policy. In particular, to maintain independent {{labor unions and}} political opposition in Vietnam, Rustin and others gave critical support to U.S. military intervention in the Vietnam War, while calling for a negotiated peace treaty and democratic elections. Rustin criticized the specific conduct of the war, though. For instance, in a fundraising letter sent to War Resisters League supporters in 1964, Rustin wrote of being [...] "angered and humiliated by the <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> being waged, a war of torture, a war in which civilians are being machine gunned from the air, and in which American napalm bombs are being dropped on the villages." ...|$|E
2500|$|Nkrumah {{also sought}} to {{eliminate}} [...] "tribalism", a source of loyalties held more deeply than those to the nation-state. Thus, as he wrote in Africa Must Unite: [...] "We {{were engaged in a}} <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> a war against poverty and disease, against ignorance, against tribalism and disunity. We needed to secure the conditions which could allow us to pursue our policy of reconstruction and development." [...] To this end, in 1958, his government passed [...] "An Act to prohibit organizations using or engaging in racial or religious propaganda to the detriment of any other racial or religious community, or securing the election of persons on account of their racial or religious affiliations, or for other purposes in connection therewith." [...] Nkrumah attempted to saturate the country in national flags, and declared a widely disobeyed ban on tribal flags.|$|E
40|$|Since {{the early}} 1970 s, {{the peace and}} {{stability}} of the Asian region has been underwritten by the simple but enormously important fact that US primacy has been uncontested by any other Asian power.

40|$|Those {{who wish}} to {{facilitate}} peace will {{be well advised to}} understand the nature <b>of</b> <b>war.</b> Yet the label war is one that often conceals as much as it reveals. We think we know what a war is, but this in itself is a source of difficulty: Throwing a label at the problem of conflict may further obscure its origins and functions; and the label, moreover, may be very useful for those {{who wish to}} promote certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> violence. The idea <b>of</b> <b>war</b> can confer a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> legitimacy upon certain types of violence, given the widespread belief that certain <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>war</b> are just and legitimate. This chapter attempts to throw some light on the nature of contemporary warfare by looking closely at some of its functions—notably, the economic functions, which are often partially obscured. The chapter challenges two common notions: that war is a contest between two sides, with each trying to win; and that war represents only a breakdown or collapse rather than the creation of an alternative system of profit, power, and protection. A number of economic functions of warfare are outlined, and attention is given to the interaction of political and economic agendas...|$|R
25|$|Wells's vision <b>of</b> a <b>war</b> {{bringing}} {{total destruction}} without moral limitations in The <b>War</b> <b>of</b> the Worlds was not taken seriously by readers {{at the time}} of publication. He later expanded these ideas in the novels When the Sleeper Wakes (1899), The War in the Air (1908), and The World Set Free (1914). This <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> total <b>war</b> did not become fully realised until the Second World War.|$|R
2500|$|However, {{the battle}} was one-sided almost from the beginning. The reasons for this {{are the subject of}} {{continuing}} study by military strategists and academics. There is general agreement that US technological superiority was a crucial factor but the speed and scale of the Iraqi collapse has also been attributed to poor strategic and tactical leadership and low morale among Iraqi troops, which resulted from a history of incompetent leadership. After devastating initial strikes against Iraqi air defenses and command and control facilities on 17 January 1991, coalition forces achieved total air superiority almost immediately. The Iraqi air force was destroyed within a few days, with some planes fleeing to Iran, where they were interned {{for the duration of the}} conflict. The overwhelming technological advantages of the US, such as stealth aircraft and infrared sights, quickly turned the air war into a [...] "turkey shoot". The heat signature of any tank which started its engine made an easy target. Air defense radars were quickly destroyed by radar-seeking missiles fired from wild weasel aircraft. Grainy video clips, shot from the nose cameras of missiles as they aimed at impossibly small targets, were a staple of US news coverage and revealed to the world a new <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>war,</b> compared by some to a video game. Over 6 weeks of relentless pounding by planes and helicopters, the Iraqi army was almost completely beaten but did not retreat, under orders from Iraqi President Saddam Hussein, and by the time the ground forces invaded on 24 February, many Iraqi troops quickly surrendered to forces much smaller than their own; in one instance, Iraqi forces attempted to surrender to a television camera crew that was advancing with coalition forces.|$|E

2500|$|Stalin's cult of personality, {{which began}} to {{manifest}} itself {{already in the}} late 1930s, was marginalized during World War II; to mobilize the population against the enemy, Soviet films focused on historical heroes who defended Russia or on the feats of the people themselves. The premier's character appeared in only two pictures during the war. However, as victory seemed secure, Stalin tightened his control over {{every aspect of the}} Soviet society, including cinema. After 1945, his cult returned to the screen with greater intensity than ever before, and he was credited as the sole architect of Germany's defeat. Denise J.
