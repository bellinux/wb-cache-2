500|$|Released on June 7, 2005, the {{collection}} has received generally positive reviews from critics. Slant Magazine's Keith Uhlich rated it three stars out of five, praising {{the quality of}} the episodes included in the set, but ultimately finding that they were best viewed {{in the context of the}} [...] "standalone" [...] episodes which were omitted—singling out [...] "Conduit" [...] and [...] "The Jersey Devil" [...] as episodes which would aid the series' [...] "dual character study". Writing for IGN, Dan Iverson rated {{the collection}} eight out of ten, finding that the mythology-based episodes formed the basis of the relationship between the characters of Mulder and Scully. Making reference to the first season episode [...] "Squeeze", not included in the collection, he added that [...] "even though people watched the series to see little green men and liver-eating elastic monsters, it was the relationship between the two which made the series a total success". However, he found that the set's extra features material was sparse, describing it as being just enough [...] "to <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> complaining". Writing for DVD Talk, Jeffrey Robinson was impressed with the collection, finding that the featured episodes worked well together without losing cohesion, and stating that [...] "whether you are a casual viewer or a fan who already owns the season sets, owning The X-Files Mythology, Volume 1: Abduction is a must". Exclaim! Monica S. Kuebler felt negatively about the collection, noting that anyone who would be interested in it would be likely to already own the collected episodes through other releases, and asking [...] "should you buy Abduction? It all depends on how much five commentaries and a doc are worth to you, because chances are, if you love the X-Files ... you've probably already bought the episodes included here at least once".|$|E
500|$|Desiring {{their own}} home stadium, in the early 1970s the Giants reached an {{agreement}} with the New Jersey Sports and Exposition Authority to play their home games at a brand-new, state-of-the-art, dedicated football stadium. Some New Yorkers were furious and Mayor John Lindsay had attempted to keep the team in the city by proposing to buy Yankee Stadium and renovate it at a cost of $24 million. Lindsay estimated that they brought $3 million to the city, and was anxious to keep that revenue, as well as satisfy New York Giant fans. Axthlem characterized the Giants fan base at the time as mostly [...] "white, suburban and fairly well to do, and its members drive cars to football games." [...] The battle became nasty with members of the New York City side claiming that the Maras [...] "complained of how inconvenient it was for them to park, or for them to get out to the neighborhood." [...] They claimed the Maras [...] "never really negotiated. They just listened...I think they were afraid if they asked for something, we might give it to them—and they wanted to <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> offering a deal that they couldn't turn down." [...] In fact, the Maras had already made the agreement {{to move out of the}} city, even though Wellington was still placating the city. He felt this was a factor in the Mara's decision to move the stadium, as the attendees could drive to their New Jersey stadium as opposed to traveling through the Bronx to Yankee Stadium. The new stadium, which would become known as Giants Stadium, was to be built at a brand new sports complex in East Rutherford, New Jersey. The decision met with outrage from some New Yorkers, and the city's mayor John Lindsay sought legal action to prevent the team from playing in Yankee Stadium — or anywhere else in New York — and demanded a congressional investigation into the deal.|$|E
2500|$|The War Council in Buda was {{immediately}} the forum of a fierce dispute. [...] The previous year, Bayezid had {{declared that he}} would attack Hungary by May, yet he had not appeared by end of July. [...] Hungarian scouts sent {{out as far as}} the Hellespont could find no sign of him, causing the French to proclaim that he was a coward. Sigismund of Hungary assured the crusaders that Bayezid would come, and advised that it would be wiser to let the Turks make the long march to them, rather than make the same long march to find them. This strategy was rejected by the French and their allies. [...] Coucy, acting as spokesman, stated, [...] "Though the Sultan's boasts be lies, that should not <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> doing deeds of arms and pursuing our enemies, for that is the purpose for which we came." [...] Sigismund {{had little choice but to}} acquiesce, though chroniclers also write that Coucy's speech excited jealousy in D'Eu, who felt that he should have had the honor of spokesman due to his position as Constable of France.|$|E

60|$|Pope argues {{here that}} since {{man is a}} part of the best {{possible}} system, whatever seems wrong in him must be right when considered in relation to the whole order of the universe. It is only our ignorance of this order which <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> realizing this fact.|$|R
5000|$|With that realization, {{the crystal}} palace {{shattered}} into splinters {{and the old}} Fairy presented the Dear Little Princess to him with the admonition, [...] "You see how self-love <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> knowing our own defects. We refuse to see them until we find them {{in the way of}} our interests." ...|$|R
2500|$|Writing for The Washington Post, Melinda Henneberger {{responded that}} [...] "we didn’t write more {{because the only}} {{abortion}} story most outlets ever cover in the news pages is every single threat or perceived threat to abortion rights. In fact, that is so fixed a view of what constitutes coverage of that issue that it’s genuinely hard, I think, for many journalists to see a story outside that paradigm as news. That’s {{not so much a}} conscious decision as a reflex, but the effect is one-sided coverage". Explaining why some of her colleagues did not report on the story, Henneberger wrote, [...] "One colleague viewed Gosnell’s alleged atrocities as a local crime story, though I can’t think of another mass murder, with hundreds of victims, that we ever saw that way. Another said it was just too lurid, though that didn’t <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> covering Jeffrey Dahmer, or that aspiring cannibal at the NYPD." [...] Writing for Bloomberg View, Jeffrey Goldberg said that this story [...] "upsets a particular narrative about the reality of certain types of abortion, and that reality isn’t something some pro-choice absolutists want to discuss".|$|E
2500|$|Neither {{team made}} it into their opponent's {{territory}} nor made a first down {{until late in the}} first quarter, when Davis fumbled the snap on a punt and Ole Miss recovered at the LSU 40-yard line. The Rebels, led by fullback Charlie Flowers, drove to the 12 as the quarter ended. To begin the second quarter Ole Miss made it down to the 2-yard line. Quarterback Bobby Franklin then kept it on a quarterback sneak and was stopped by Fugler at the one-foot line. LSU was offside on the play, but Rebels captain Kent Lovelace declined the penalty, choosing to have the ball at the one-foot line with three downs rather than the one-yard line with four. [...] "I didn't think any team in the country could <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> scoring from the one-foot line in three downs," [...] Lovelace later explained. On the next run, Fugler again stopped the Rebels short of the goal-line, and Rabb made the next tackle on third down. On fourth down, Cannon and Fugler broke through the line to stop Lovelace three yards short of the end zone, where the Tigers took over on downs. The teams exchanged punts three times before a twenty-yard run by Purvis put LSU at the Ole Miss 25, where Davis attempted a field goal that fell short. The Tigers then recovered a fumble on the Rebels' 21-yard line, and from there drove into the end zone with a scramble by Rabb. The half ended with LSU leading 7–0.|$|E
2500|$|In {{response}} {{a debate}} over banning gay and lesbian marriage occurred in the Minnesota Legislature. On the House floor Lindner claimed that allowing same-sex marriage would {{open the door to}} [...] "a man marrying a child or a man marrying a dog." [...] Openly gay State Rep. Karen Clark (whose partner, parents, and her partner's parents were attending the debate) expressed dismay at the comment. Lindner told her “I don't know why you felt that was insulting. I was trying to make a point, that we've got a norm of one man, one woman. Once we begin to deviate...what's to <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> having to pass laws to allow a man to marry several women, or a man and a boy relationship -- and there [...] are people who would like to have that. When we start changing that definition of marriage, that does open up the door to others who will say 'Why not us?'” He told Clark that while he saw her as “one of God’s creations. ...I personally don't think the lifestyle you've chosen and other homosexuals have chosen is really good [...] for you, your partner or society. ...I'm talking in general, the HIV/AIDS problem, other diseases. It probably affects more homosexual men. ...I don't know of any [...] couple, where they've been faithful to each other, a man and a woman, has any fear of any sexually transmitted disease unless they have to get a blood transfusion. ...you're living in sin." [...] He also stated [...] "I don't believe adoption of children by homosexual couples is [...] {{in the best interests of}} children." [...] (In 1997 Minnesota enacted the Marriage Protection Act defining marriage as a [...] "civil contract between a man and a woman" [...] and stating that [...] "Lawful marriage may be contracted only between persons of the opposite sex".) ...|$|E

2500|$|In June 1918, McKenzie sought {{approval}} from the trustees to raise revenue by using Fisk's campus as a receiving station for Black troops in the Student Army Training Corps (SATC), a precursor to the present-day Reserve Officers' Training Corp (ROTC) program. The Student Army Training Corp allowed students to attend school while they participated in military training exercises during World War I. McKenzie noted that accommodating the troops, [...] "will cramp us very considerably, but the compensation will <b>keep</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> any additional indebtedness and probably turn our lodging and boarding department into a self-supporting institution, and enable us to make a number of necessary changes or improvements without cutting into our normal funds. I am glad, too, to be of very direct service to the nation in its persecution of the War." [...] In August 1918, the first of over 600 Black SATC cadets arrived in Nashville. [...] "The boys will live a highly educational military life, centered about Bennett Hall. The girls will live an equally efficient, busy school life, centered about Jubilee Hall," [...] he stated. However the presence of military cadets on Fisk's campus, {{all of whom were}} young men, added to the University's disciplinary problems. While McKenzie appreciated the disciplinary focus of the military's proscribed daily routine, he harshly criticized the military's refusal to acknowledge and abide by Fisk's rules and regulations. At the opening of the 1918 academic year, McKenzie set the tone for a new approach to student conduct by invoking the military's presence and influence on the campus, [...] "We are a military institution. Not that we have been absorbed by the military, but that the essential principles of efficiency exemplified in the military have been absorbed into the university. These principles include concentration of effort, unremitting toil, elimination of all unnecessary activities and motions, regular and insistent schedule of life, promptness, accuracy, reliability thoroughness, instant and complete obedience. With military leaders unwilling to enforce [...] "satisfactory moral standards," [...] their cadets ran rampant, smoking, cursing, and fraternizing with Fisk co-eds. In one significant infraction, a soldier helped a female Fisk student to [...] "escape supervision" [...] of the University and was found with her in a private room. Although the man was arrested, the military administered no punishment. In addition to the poor behavior of cadets, McKenzie strongly criticized the federal government for failing to provide Black soldiers adequate compensation for their service to the nation. [...] "When the immediate aim of efficient fighters was no longer its aim, the Government sought to free itself from its financial obligations and forgot what havoc it would work in the lives of many, many young men," [...] McKenzie lamented in the Fisk News. While the mobilization effort only lasted a few months and World War I ended in November 1918, the military presence had lasting effects on Fisk's campus school discipline. McKenzie continued to experiment the military's model of conduct, but the continued military discipline for student conduct policies after the military's departure from campus angered Fisk students. Viewing the new policies as infringing on their rights, several Fisk students rebelled. McKenzie reported, [...] "The other day the college boys served notice on me that until I was inclined to treat them like men they would refuse to attend the study hall. It did not take very many hours to secure written pledges from all but five of them that they would attend. Since then, one or more of them have attempted to spoil the lights in the study hall, and they have torn down the picture of President Cravath and written an ugly message on the chapel wall where the picture was. McKenzie noted the required study hall also angered certain Fisk alumni, remarking [...] "Only last night I was sent almost direct word to the effect that the alumni would protest against the study hall, and a reminder of the fact that practically no white man is trusted by any Negro." ...|$|E

50|$|Another {{assumption}} {{deals with}} the concept of uncertainty. Gudykunst assumes that when uncertainty falls between an individual's minimum and maximum acceptable levels, effective communication will then take place. The maximum threshold is defined as the amount of uncertainty that we can possess and still comfortably predict the behavior of a stranger. Uncertainty above the minimum threshold <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> getting bored with the stranger and hence constraining communication.|$|R

5000|$|In 1966, the Congress on the World Mission of the Church, held in Wheaton, Illinois, brought {{together}} Evangelicals from 71 countries.

50|$|Prayer is watchful {{communion with}} the Lord, which communion <b>keeps</b> <b>us</b> <b>from</b> {{yielding}} to temptation. To watch and pray is work; {{we need to}} do more than simply have noble spiritual intentions about not yielding to temptation.

They were too weary to be spiritually vigilant.|$|R
