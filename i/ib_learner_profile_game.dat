I approach the research after reviewing the concept of the self and using pragmatic methodology The research consisted of a questionnaire and semi-structured interview aimed at eliciting from the students their opinion about the extent to which they had equal command of the different attributes and, if they had differing abilities, if they were seeking to improve their command of the attribute(s) and who they though could help them do so. I was also interested in knowing if the students believed that the attributes of the <b>IB</b> <b>Learner</b> <b>Profile</b> helped them to be internationally minded, as suggested by the International Baccalaureate. The results suggest that most of the students believe that they have differing degrees of command of the attributes and that it is necessary for them to develop the ones that they feel less proficient in. They tend to believe that the attributes are developed partly at school, but also by their parents, themselves and others. They tend to believe that they are similar in terms of character to students that study at schools that do not offer the IB, but academically they are somewhat different. That said, they also tend to believe that the attributes of the <b>IB</b> <b>Learner</b> <b>Profile</b> help them to be internationally minded, particularly those of ‘open-minded’ and ‘communicator’, which coincide with the theoretical position of Castro et al (2013) and Singh and Qi (2013).

There is a striking match between these skills and IB outcomes; thus, DP graduates perform well in higher education and add to the reputation of those institutions. After a review of the literature, the authors found the IB Diploma Programme has been studied in many countries by both consultants and educational agencies, and also by a wide array of universities themselves; however, there are fewer qualitative studies concerning the degree to which IB graduates display attitudes, values, and behaviours in line with the <b>IB</b> <b>Learner</b> <b>Profile.</b> This is why the authors stress the claims made are supported by examples of significant research, noting that there is a dearth of qualitative longitudinal studies to sufficiently substantiate the affective domain claims that currently rely more on anecdotal evidence.

This study {{attempted}} to determine teachers’ {{perspectives on the}} 10 attributes of the <b>IB</b> <b>learner</b> <b>profile.</b> The 24 participants in this descriptive case study were elementary classroom teachers ranging from kindergarten to grade 5 at an international, private, bilingual school in Ankara, Turkey during the 2011 - 2012 school year. A survey and semi-structured interviews {{were used to determine}} teachers’ perspectives on the clarity of assessing the <b>learner</b> <b>profile</b> attributes, the strategies used for assessing the attributes, and the classification of the attributes into four given categories. Frequency analysis established which of the <b>learner</b> <b>profile</b> attributes were perceived to be the clearest, as well as the most unclear attributes, when considering assessment. Caring was the <b>learner</b> <b>profile</b> teachers perceived to be the clearest attribute to assess, while balanced was the attribute teachers perceived to be the most unclear to assess. Frequency analysis was also used to determine into which categories each of the attributes was classified. Five common themes emerged from survey responses, and were further developed through the analysis of the semi-structured interviews as to why teachers perceived certain attributes to be more difficult, or unclear, when considering assessment. The five themes were: “subjectivity due to the abstract nature of certain attributes,” “artificial results,” attributes that are “unable to be observed,” and finally, “personal,” and “cultural” elements. Another major result of this study was that participants had different understandings regarding classification of the 10 attributes amongst themselves, as well as when compared to the classification Dr. Kate Bullock published in 2011. Supported by the literature reviewed for this research, this study suggests that the ambiguity of the <b>learner</b> <b>profile</b> attributes {{is due to the fact}} that the IB has not provided research into how and why the current 10 attributes were chosen. More importantly, the IB has not provided research about theories of values development in children throughout different age groups. It is recommended that the IB create common documents to assist with data collection and reporting on the <b>learner</b> <b>profile</b> attributes; the <b>IB</b> intensively train teachers on how to implement the learner profile; and the IB create a developmental continuum for each of the attributes of the <b>learner</b> <b>profile.</b> Weiss, KristinM.

40|$|AbstractThe {{adaptive}} {{educational systems}} include several solutions for providing personalized {{access to the}} learning process. The <b>learner's</b> <b>profile</b> constitutes the key element of these solutions.

As a consequence, {{there is a strong}} need to exchange the <b>learner's</b> <b>profiles</b> between different systems to enhance and enrich the learner's knowledge. However, the data exchange between the <b>learner's</b> <b>profiles</b> implies interoperability problems.

In this context, we propose an architecture allowing the data exchange of the <b>learner's</b> <b>profile</b> in educational cross-systems in order to improve the adaptation navigation. This architecture is automatically adapted to the <b>learner's</b> <b>profiles</b> that evolve over time. These latter are syntactically, semantically and structurally heterogeneous.
