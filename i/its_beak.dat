5|$|The irises of {{its eyes}} are red, its feet are black, and <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> is flesh-colored. The eye {{has a single}} {{incomplete}} row of eyelashes on the upper lid and two rows on the lower lid. <b>Its</b> <b>beak</b> is thick, rounded, and hooked at the tip. Because of its habit of urohidrosis, the scaly portions of its legs are often streaked white with uric acid.|$|E
5|$|In the ground, they dig for {{earthworms}} and grubs, {{and they}} search for beetles, cicada, crickets, flies, weta, spiders, caterpillars, slugs and snails on the ground. They will also feed on berries and seeds. To find prey, the great spotted kiwi use their scenting skills or feel vibrations {{caused by the}} movement of their prey. To do the latter, a kiwi would stick <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> into the ground, then use <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> to dig into the ground. As they are nocturnal, they do not emerge until thirty minutes after sunset to begin the hunt. Kiwis will also swallow small stones, which aid in digestion.|$|E
5|$|Observed in this species, the wing-fluttering {{display is}} seen in several situations: females responding, and presumably acquiescing, to male {{courtship}} displays, juveniles begging for food, by helpers to older birds, and immature males to senior ones. The fairywren lowers its head and tail, outstretches and quivers its wings and holds <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> open silently.|$|E

50|$|The New Zealand kākā eats fruits, berries, seeds, flowers, buds, nectar, sap, {{plants and}} invertebrates. It uses <b>its</b> strong <b>beak</b> to shred the cones of the kauri tree {{to obtain the}} seeds. It has a brush tongue with which it feeds on nectar, and it uses <b>its</b> strong <b>beak</b> to dig out the grubs of the huhu beetle and to remove bark to feed on sap.|$|R
5|$|Several {{characteristics}} of the hawksbill sea turtle distinguish it from other sea turtle species. Its elongated, tapered head ends in a beak-like mouth (from which its common name is derived), and <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> is more sharply pronounced and hooked than others. The hawksbill's forelimbs have two visible claws on each flipper.|$|E
5|$|This species forages in {{the early}} morning or late {{afternoon}} either alone or in small groups in leaf litter and on dead tree trunks. It is also known to leap upwards to grab prey on overhanging foliage. It looks for its prey either by standing still and scanning the surrounding area or by tossing the leaf litter away with <b>its</b> <b>beak.</b> It also frequently follows columns of Dorylus ants, feeding on the insects flushed by the ants. It also is known to hunt in streams for crabs and fish. It crushes snails with <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> and, if its prey struggles, smashes it against the ground. While an uncommon occurrence, male rockfowl have been observed giving food to a female.|$|E
5|$|In 1840, {{in order}} to {{differentiate}} the military colors from the war flag, Ghica adopted a new design for the former: a red-yellow-blue tricolor, with red on top and stripes of equal width. In the center was a white shield bordered with gold and decorated with the Wallachian eagle, wearing the princely crown and with a cross in <b>its</b> <b>beak.</b>|$|E

5|$|The bushcrow feeds both on {{the ground}} and in trees. It begins {{foraging}} at sunrise. While foraging, a bushcrow can be alone, in a pair, or in a group of six or seven other bushcrows. A foraging bushcrow digs vigorously in the soil while <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> is held slightly open to catch any insects it unearths. When it catches something, it carries it to the nearest tree or bush, pins it down with its foot, and kills and eats the prey. This species has also been seen using <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> to tear apart rotten wood and inspecting cattle dung in the search for food. It may also land on the backs of cattle to search for parasites. It can also chase flying insects, which it does on foot, abruptly changing direction and taking flying leaps after its prey. It often mixes with white-crowned starlings, red-billed hornbills, red-billed buffalo weavers, and superb starlings while foraging. When hunting in the trees, it is capable of walking atop horizontal branches and jumping upwards towards the crown, then descending in a glide from the crown to the ground.|$|E
5|$|The hookbill's {{distinguishing}} characteristic was a heavy, parrotlike bill. The {{upper mandible}} hooked sharply downwards, while the heavy lower mandible hooked sharply upwards towards {{the middle of}} the upper mandible. This structure left a gap between the two mandibles when the bird held <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> closed. It is believed that the bill was pale pink in coloration. The jaw muscles were particularly well developed around the bill. The hookbill's tongue was primitive and nontubular.|$|E
5|$|The spongy {{bones of}} the woodpecker's skull and the {{flexibility}} of <b>its</b> <b>beak,</b> both of which provide protection for the brain when drumming, have provided inspiration to engineers; a black box needs to survive intact when a plane falls from the sky, and modelling the black box with regard to a woodpecker's anatomy has increased the resistance of this device to damage sixty-fold. The design of protective helmets is another field being influenced by the study of woodpeckers.|$|E

50|$|The Inca tern feeds {{primarily}} on small fish, such as anchovies. The species spots its prey from the air, diving {{into the water}} to grab meals with <b>its</b> pointed <b>beak.</b> Its call is a cat-like mew.|$|R
5|$|Their diet {{consists}} {{primarily of}} small aquatic prey, such as insects and small fishes. Crayfish are its preferred food in most regions, {{but it can}} adjust its diet according to the habitat and prey abundance. Its main foraging behavior is probing with <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> {{at the bottom of}} shallow water to feel for and capture its prey. It does not see the prey.|$|E
5|$|This {{species has}} {{numerous}} common names, including the grey-necked rockfowl, grey-necked picathartes, bare-headed rockfowl, red-headed rockfowl, blue-headed picathartes, and grey-necked bald crow. Rockfowl is {{a reference to}} the species' habit of building mud nests on rock surfaces and caves. Picathartes refers to the species' scientific name. Bald crow is a reference to its featherless head and somewhat crow-like appearance, especially in <b>its</b> <b>beak.</b>|$|E
5|$|When {{disturbed}} at its roosting site, {{an angry}} barn owl lowers {{its head and}} sways it from side to side, or the head may be lowered and stretched forward and the wings drooped while the bird emits hisses and makes snapping noises with <b>its</b> <b>beak.</b> A defensive attitude involves lying {{flat on the ground}} or crouching with wings spread out.|$|E

5|$|An origin myth {{from the}} Murri people of Queensland, cited by Andrew Lang, {{describes}} how the Australian pelican acquired its black and white plumage. The pelican, formerly a black bird, made a canoe during a flood {{in order to save}} drowning people. He {{fell in love with a}} woman he thus saved, but she and her friends tricked him and escaped. The pelican consequently prepared to go to war against them by daubing himself with white clay as war paint. However, before he had finished, another pelican, on seeing such a strange piebald creature, killed him with <b>its</b> <b>beak,</b> and all such pelicans have been black and white ever since.|$|E
5|$|Contemporary {{accounts}} {{describe the}} Mascarene grey parakeet as a grey, long-tailed parrot. Subfossils show that <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> was about 30% {{longer than that}} of the sympatric echo parakeet, and that it had a comparatively broad beak. Members of the Psittacula genus commonly have large, red beaks, and long tail feathers, with the central ones being the longest. It also differed from its congeners in other osteological details. It was skeletally similar to the Alexandrine parakeet, but some of its bones were larger and more robust. Its colouration also separated it from all other members of Psittacula, the majority of which are green or partially green.|$|E
5|$|Large and {{predominantly}} white, {{the king}} vulture has gray to black ruff, flight, and tail feathers. The {{head and neck}} are bald, with the skin color varying, including yellow, orange, blue, purple, and red. The king vulture has a very noticeable orange fleshy caruncle on <b>its</b> <b>beak.</b> This vulture is a scavenger and it often makes the initial cut into a fresh carcass. It also displaces smaller New World vulture species from a carcass. King vultures {{have been known to}} live for up to 30 years in captivity.|$|E

50|$|Like other ceratopsians, Graciliceratops {{would have}} been an herbivore, using <b>its</b> {{powerful}} <b>beak</b> and shearing teeth to process tough plant matter. Little is known about the flora of the ancient Gobi Desert, and so it is unclear what it would have eaten.|$|R
50|$|Pteranodon: This {{pterosaur}} {{is able to}} grab {{humans and}} drop them to their death. Its standard attack is pecking enemies with <b>its</b> sharp <b>beak.</b> Upon roaring, enemies are highlighted to team mates. Although fast in flight, this class moves much slower when walking.|$|R
5|$|The Hunyadi {{family was}} one of the most {{powerful}} noble families in the Kingdom of Hungary during the 15thcentury. A member of the family, Matthias Corvinus, was King of Hungary from 1458 until 1490, King of Bohemia (ruling in Moravia, Lower Lusatia, Upper Lusatia, and Silesia) from 1469 until 1490, and Duke of Austria from 1487 until 1490. His illegitimate son, John Corvinus, ruled the Duchy of Troppau from 1485 until 1501, and five further Silesian duchies, including Bytom, Głubczyce, Loslau, Racibórz, and Tost, from 1485 until 1490. The Hunyadi coat-of-arms depicted a raven with a golden ring in <b>its</b> <b>beak.</b>|$|E
5|$|Unlike some finch species, the American {{goldfinch}} {{uses its}} feet extensively in feeding. It frequently hangs from seedheads while feeding {{in order to}} reach the seeds more easily. In the spring, the American goldfinch feeds on the catkins hanging from birches and alders by pulling one up with <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> and using its toes to hold the catkin still against the branch. This dexterity enables it to take advantage of food sources relatively inaccessible to potential competitors, increasing its chances of survival.|$|E
5|$|Pair {{formation}} in the black-necked grebe usually starts during pauses in the migration to the breeding grounds, although it occasionally occurs before, in wintering pairs. This pair formation continues after this grebe has arrived to its breeding grounds. Courtship occurs when it arrives at the breeding lake. The displays are performed {{in the middle of}} the lake. There is no territory involved in courting; individuals used the whole area of the lake. When advertising for a mate, a black-necked grebe will approach other black-necked grebes with its body fluffed out and its neck erect. It closes <b>its</b> <b>beak</b> to perform a call, poo-eee-chk, with the last note only barely audible. Courtship generally stops at the start of nesting.|$|E
50|$|This breed is {{available}} in both clean legged and muffed (feathered legs) varieties. Due to <b>its</b> short <b>beak</b> it requires foster parents (homing pigeons etc.) to raise its young. The breed is popular {{around the world and}} has continued development particularly in the United States.|$|R
