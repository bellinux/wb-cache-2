40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{consists of}} four essays on pricing fixed income derivatives and risk management. The first essay presents pricing and duration formulas for floating <b>rate</b> bonds and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> with embedded <b>options.</b> It combines Briys et al. 2 ̆ 7 s approximation with the extended Vasicek term structure model to value caps and floors. Using this approach, it computes the durations of caps, floors, collars, floating rate bonds with collars and <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> with collars, and provides comparative statics analyses of these durations {{with respect to the}} underlying variables such as the cap rate, the floor <b>rate,</b> the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> volatility, and the level of <b>interest</b> <b>rates.</b> ^ The second essay explores a class of polynomial Taylor series expansions for approximating the bond return function, and examines its implication for managing <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> risk. The generalized duration vector models derived from alternative Taylor series expansion extend Fong and Fabozzi 2 ̆ 7 s M-square model and Nawalkha and Chambers 2 ̆ 7 M-vector model, and the empirical tests show that immunization results can be improved for models g(t) = tα with α less than 1 when higher order generalized duration vectors are used. ^ The third essay develops a methodology to build recombining trees for pricing American options on bonds under deterministic volatility HJM models. Without imposing the HJM drift restriction, our approach uses the Nelson-Ramaswamy transformation to generate recombining forward rate trees. We show that the option prices obtained from our recombining trees satisfy Merton 2 ̆ 7 s bond option PDE when step size approaches zero. Numerical simulations provide evidence that this approach is efficient in pricing both European and American contingent claims. ^ The fourth essay obtains computationally efficient trees for pricing European options under two types of proportional volatility HJM models. We construct a numeraire economy in which European options are priced using a maturity-specific equivalent martingale measure. We then show that for the two types of proportional volatility models, European option prices are independent of the forward rate drift under this maturity-specific equivalent martingale measure. Our method is particularly beneficial when used to price long-dated caps, floors and collars because these instruments involve a large number of long-dated puts and calls. ...|$|R

40|$|In our {{paper we}} present the most {{important}} characteristics of the forint <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market, as well as examine the determinants and the information content of the forint <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> spreads. The turnover of the forint <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market has grown dynamically in recent years, and now it may reach, or even exceed, the turnover of the government bond market. Due to the hedging activity of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market makers, there is a close linkage between the forint <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> market and the government bond market. In terms of investors, the <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> and government bond markets are strongly segmented. Consequently, the spillover from one market segment to the other is not perfect. Our analyses suggest that long-term forint <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swap</b> spreads {{are exposed to the}} common impact of several factors. The strongest effects are attributed to government bond purchases by residents, the Maggie A spread, the slope of the yield curve and the forint/euro forward yield spread. In the developments of swap spreads, the impact of those trading strategies employing <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> can be detected. These are widespread in the domestic market, as is confirmed by anecdotal information. The results indicate that in certain cases the swap yields, while at other times the government bond yields carry additional information about long-term yield expectations.

Since the {{inception}} of the swap market in 1981, the outstanding notional principal of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> has reached a level of $ 12. 81 trillion in 1995. Recent surveys indicate that <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> are the most commonly used <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> derivative by nonfinancial firms and that nonfinancial firms are major users of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps.</b> In this paper, we provide an economic rationale for the use of <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> by such nonfinancial firms. In a global economy, given the floating exchange rate regime, nonfinancial firms face economic exposure in the presence of foreign competition. Asymmetric information about economic exposure leads to mispricing of the firms' debt, and the firm chooses either short-term or long-term debt to minimize the cost of debt. We show that when there is a favorable (unfavorable) exchange rate shock, an exposed firm chooses short-term (long-term) debt together with fixed-for-floating (floating-for-fixed) <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps.</b> Given <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> expectations, <b>interest</b> <b>rate</b> <b>swaps</b> enable the firm to minimize the cost of fixed or floating <b>rate</b> debt. <b>Interest</b> rates; International finance; Risk; Swaps (Finance) ...|$|R
