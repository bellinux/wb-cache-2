40|$|Abstract. As {{increasing}} {{amounts of}} data are produced, packaged and delivered in digital form, in a fast, networked environment, one of its main features threatens to become its worst enemy: zero-cost verbatim copies. The ability to produce duplicates of digital Works at almost no cost can now be misused for <b>illicit</b> <b>profit.</b> This mandates mechanisms for effective rights assessment and protection. One such mechanism is based on Information Hiding. By concealing a resilient rights holder identity “signature ” (watermark) within the digital Work(s) to be protected, Information Hiding for Rights Assessment (Watermarking) enables ulterior court-time proofs associating particular Works with their respective rights holders. One main challenge {{is the fact that}} altering the Work in the process of hiding information could possibly destroy its value. At the same time one has to be concerned with a malicious adversary, with major incentives to remove or alter the watermark beyond detection – thus disabling the ability for court-time proofs – without destroying the value of the Work – to preserve its potential for <b>illicit</b> <b>profit.</b> In this chapter we explore how Information Hiding can be deployed as an effective tool for Rights Assessment for discrete digital data.

40|$|Traditional {{definitions}} of organised crime {{tend to focus}} on its links with the market. They depict organised crime as an alternative industry based on the stable supply of a criminal market, characterised by the use of force or threat by it, and motivated by <b>illicit</b> <b>profit</b> or a quest of political power. These definitions arise from the historically most common depictions of specific activities of organised crime, which in most parts of Europe and North America have traditionally been associated with the illegal collection of debts, extortion rackets, contract murders or systemic corruption leading to, and associated with, a transnational trade in drugs. Through the evolution of the definitions, these stereotypes have gradually waned away, and the use of violence, as well as the primary motivation by material profit, has been omitted from the lists of obligatory characteristics that a crime must fulfill in order to be classified as “organised crime”. More recently, in the European Union definition, the use of violence and motivation by profit alone have been made only conditional criteria, and the quest of institutional power has been recognised as a motivating factor for organised crime equal to that of generating <b>illicit</b> <b>profit.</b> These new definitional approaches have opened the way to revolutionary ways of understanding the development of organised crime, specifically to including white-collar crime and massive fraud in the future {{definitions of}} organised crime, as well as further elaborating the aspect of political violence that is present in many organised crime activities across the world. In the Balkans, these new moments in defining organised crime appear to have been tested particularly directly in Serbia, where, first, there has been a long public debate over a systematic “siphoning away” of public funds to the accounts of private companies through the mass corruption of a former, post-communist government until 2001. Subsequently, organised criminal rings have been accused of having masterminded and executed the assassination of the late Serbian Prime Minister, Dr Zoran Đinđić. The Balkans, and particularly Serbia, have been exposed {{to some of the most}} destructive consequences of organised crime. Correspondingly, the region can serve as a polygon or testing grounds for the exploration of the conceptual issues associated with organised crime. Finally, the experiences in crime control gained in this process could be valuable tools to address organised crime elsewhere. This especially concerns the emergence of what has recently become known in criminological discourse as the “New War-Making Criminal Entity”. This paper explores the key features of organised crime against the background of the Serbian, and, by extension, Balkan circumstances, and draws conclusions as to how these experiences can be useful more globally...|$|E

To this end, we utilized a model as proposed in the prior research (Alrwais et al. 2014; Moore et al. 2011): R(t)[*]= Nv(t) Pa Ra where the total revenue R(t) during the time period t is calculated from {{the total number of}} actions taken (i.e., click-through number, number of visitors Nv(t) weighed by the probability that the visitors take action Pa) and the average revenue per action Ra. Here, we assume the price model as pay per action: that is, the adversary gets paid only when a specified action (e.g., software installation) is taken by the victims. Using a PassiveDNS dataset (DNSDB 2015), which contains DNS lookups recorded by the Security Information Exchange, we estimated the daily number of visitors in February 2015 (data crawling time, i.e., attack time) Nv =[*] 32  M. Note that the probability of a visitor taking action Pa is difficult to estimate due to the various malicious pages on different sites.

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that all {{developing}} countries are different in kind and quality, all have problems and needs regarding the provision of decent and sanitary housing for their growing populations and this requirement constitutes one of the major problems for the governments of these countries. Many cities in the developing world suffer from regional imbalance. Migration from rural to urban areas has ended up with huge population growth in urban areas and eventually informal housing areas, or squatter settlements, have become a fact of life. In the case of Turkey, the squatter settlements spread across the face of the country's urban areas while initially developed to meet the housing needs of the mushrooming population they have become a vehicle for <b>illicit</b> <b>profit</b> taking. So, despite {{the fact that}} the squatter neighborhoods have increased the amount of housing available, they have also developed into tools for land speculation, thus acting as a barrier to the development of viable alternatives. Today, squatter settlements in Turkey as in developing countries reflect social, economical and environmental problems with their changing identities. In this process they must be seen as a formation which should be discussed by architects, planners, engineers, psychologist, economists or politicians, and some solutions, projects must be developed. This paper concentrated on discussion for solutions to informal housing in Turkey. The main objectives are to examine possible solutions and to reach valuable results in the scope of the findings. Initially squatter settlements in Turkey are described in general terms. Then legal and planning dimensions which have been implemented since 1950 are discussed. Among the planning measures that would be utilized following the passing of suitable laws are those which can be discussed under the headings of upgrading, prevention, and elimination. In relation to this approaches examples from Turkey and from other developing countries have been cited. The second section of this work includes a discussion of the applied research studies presented in "Housing for the Urban Poor" workshops held within the framework of the Med Campus Housing Network. This section briefly summarize the descriptions of the PYnar Squatter Settlement and the solutions suggested for the problems identified at the settlement. The last section uses the experimental work of the study to arrive at nation-wide level solutions for the squatter problem in Turkey. publisher versio...|$|E

Why do some kleptocrats grant political opponents significant leeway to organize, while others enforce strict limits on such activities?
