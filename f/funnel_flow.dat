40|$|Results {{from many}} recent field {{experiments}} {{have indicated that}} groundwater contamination by pesticides is not associated with the bulk soil matrix flow which occurred throughout the entire vadose zone. A small amount of pesticide can be transported very expeditiously through certain pathways in unsaturated soils. A generic term "preferential flow" became popular {{during the last decade}} to describe this bypassing phenomenon. The objective {{of this paper is to}} review the mechanisms and properties of funnel-type preferential flow and discuss its impact on contaminant transport in unsaturated sandy soils. Soils deposited by rivers, lakes, glaciers, oceans, or wind or weathered from different natural parent materials consist of strata laid down at different times and under different circumstances. Different strata generally have different porosities and permeabilities and are often inclined. It was observed that inclined very coarse sand or clay and silt layers/lenses in a sandy vadose zone could funnel uniform unsaturated matrix flow into congregated flow paths. The congregated pathways bypassed most of the soil matrix as they moved to the groundwater. The <b>funnel</b> <b>flow</b> was triggered by a macroscopic Haines ' jump across the boundary. Numerical simulation were conducted to determine how contaminant transport was influenced <b>funnel</b> <b>flow</b> paths. Results showed that it took only one-fourth of the time for a contaminant to leach out from profiles through funnel-type preferential flow paths as compared to that through a homogeneous pro-file. There was enough contaminant to leach out from the 2 -D profiles through <b>funnel</b> <b>flow</b> paths to contaminate groundwater even at very low infiltration rate.

Discharge outlets from the flume can be placed at any location along the vertical line of the flume. Tests were performed with soft red winter wheat in a smooth-walled, model grain bin 2. 44 m in diameter and 7. 44 m tall, constructed of galvanized steel.

40|$|Research Doctorate - Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) Silos {{and gravity}} reclaim {{stockpiles}} {{are widely used}} to store and handle bulk materials in industry. The rathole mechanism for <b>funnel</b> <b>flow</b> in silos or gravity reclaim stockpiles, and the loads on support structures buried in stockpiles, play a decisive {{role in determining the}} dimensions of silos and their support structures, and are closely related to the stress conditions developed within the bulk solid handled. Therefore, the reliability and efficiency of these storage facilities can be enhanced by employing optimal designs based on a good understanding of the stress conditions. However, thus far, the stress conditions in silos or stockpiles during storage and flow have not been satisfactorily examined in the field of bulk solids handling. Therefore, the aim of this thesis is to investigate these stress conditions. In order to investigate the performance of <b>funnel</b> <b>flow,</b> laser devices were employed to depict rathole profiles occurring in silos and gravity reclaim stockpiles. Different silo geometrical configurations and different bulk materials were applied in the experimental investigation. In addition, the experimental outcomes obtained by a probe-profile gauge in 1987 were also used in the comparison regarding rathole geometries and draw-down heads between all the experimental results and the theoretical predictions from Roberts and Jenike’s theories. The results reveal that Roberts’s hoop stress theory is capable of predicting the rathole geometry, especially for <b>funnel</b> <b>flow</b> occurring in gravity reclaim stockpiles. The work presented also investigates the loads exerted on support structures, such as a column buried in a stockpile. A laboratory scale test rig was established with two different column setups employed to determine the loads acting on the columns. Tekscan tactile pressure sensors and load cells were used to measure the normal pressure distributions on the column faces and total vertical and lateral forces exerted on the column, respectively. Discrete Element Method (DEM) simulation work corresponding to the experiments was also undertaken to explore the load conditions. Although deficiencies exist in the current cohesive contact model in the DEM software packages applied, the normal loads and shear loads were obtained from both the experimental and simulation work, and the comparison between them showed reasonable agreement.

The knowledge of physical properties of food powders is also important for quality assessment of final product on-line as well as during later storage, handling and transport. Flow properties of powders influence handling and processing operations, such as flow from silos and hoppers, transportation, mixing, compaction and packaging (KNOWLTON et al. 1994). Two basic patterns of the flow in silos can be distinguished: mass flow and <b>funnel</b> <b>flow</b> (KNOWLTON et al. 1994; FITZPATRICK et al. 2003; JENIKE 1964; SCHWEDES 1996).

To prevent soil water pollution and estimate the magnitude of the hazard caused by these chemicals, it is necessary to know the processes controlling their movement from the soil surface, through the root zone and eventually to the water table. This paper deals with two-dimensional soil water distribution and movement in sloping layered soils of a dam farmland on the Loess Plateau of China. In the dam farmland, soil water content showed horizontal distribution corresponding to spatial patterns of the particle sizes. The soil water content of deeper soil was relatively stable compared with topsoil. Generally, rainfall infiltration was limited to 0. 8 m in the study period. Funnel flows were found in the layered soils of the dam farmland after rainfall proving the existence of this phenomenon which was observed in simulation experiments and field observation by previous researches.

40|$|An {{understanding}} of preferential {{flow in the}} vadose zone is crucial for the prediction of the fate of pollutants. Infiltration basins, developed to mitigate the adverse effects of impervious surfaces in urban areas, are established above strongly heterogeneous and highly permeable deposits and thus are prone to preferential flow and enhanced pollutant transport. This study numerically investigates the establishment of preferential flow in an infiltration basin in the Lyon suburbs (France) established over a highly heterogeneous glaciofluvial deposit covering much of the Lyon region. An investigation of the soil transect (13. 5 m long and 2. 5 m deep) provided full characterization of lithology and hydraulic properties of present lithofacies. Numerical modeling with the HYDRUS- 2 D model of water flow in the transect was used to identify the effects of individual lithofacies that constitute the deposit. Multiple scenarios that considered different levels of heterogeneity were evaluated. Preferential flow was studied for several values of infiltration rates applied after a long dry period. The numerical study shows that the high contrast in hydraulic properties of different lithofacies triggers the establishment of preferential flow (capillary barriers and <b>funneled</b> <b>flow).</b> Preferential flow develops mainly for low water fluxes imposed at the surface. The role of individual lithofacies in triggering preferential flow depends on their shapes (layering versus inclusions) and their sizes.

The transonic flows have very different behaviors for γ > 7 / 5 and 7 / 5, the Mach number M≡ | v|/c_s (with c_s the sound speed) initially increases with R decreasing from R_d, but for R decreasing from ≈ 0. 22 R_d (for γ= 5 / 3) the Mach number surprisingly decreases. In the other limit, γ < 7 / 5, M increases monotonically with decreasing R. Application of these results is made to <b>funnel</b> <b>flows</b> to rotating magnetized neutron stars and young stellar objects. Comment: 7 pages, 7 figures, submitted to Ap...|$|R
40|$|The high opacity of He I 10830 {{makes it}} an {{exceptionally}} sensitive probe of the inner wind geometry of accreting T Tauri stars. In this line blueshifted absorption below the continuum results from simple scattering of stellar photons, a situation which is readily modeled without definite knowledge of the physical conditions and recourse to multi-level radiative transfer. We present theoretical line profiles for scattering in two possible wind geometries, a disk wind and a wind emerging radially from the star, and compare them to observed He I 10830 profiles from a survey of classical T Tauri stars. The comparison indicates that subcontinuum blueshifted absorption is characteristic of disk winds in ~ 30 % of the stars and of stellar winds in ~ 40 %. We further conclude that for many stars the emission profile of helium likely arises in stellar winds, increasing the fraction of accreting stars inferred to have accretion-powered stellar winds to ~ 60 %. Stars with the highest disk accretion rates {{are more likely to}} have stellar wind than disk wind signatures and less likely to have redshifted absorption from magnetospheric <b>funnel</b> <b>flows.</b> This suggests the possibility that when accretion rates are high, disks can extend closer to the star, magnetospheric accretion zones can be reduced in size and conditions arise that favor radially outflowing stellar winds.

40|$|We {{received}} Type A and B funding {{under the}} NASA Astrophysics Data Program {{for the analysis}} and interpretation of hard x-ray data obtained by the Rossi X-ray Timing Explorer and other NASA sponsored missions for Intermediate Polars (IPS) and Polars. For some targets, optical data was available. We reduced and analyzed the X-ray spectra and the X-ray and optical (obtained at the Cerro Tololo Inter-American Observatory) timing data using detailed shock models (which we constructed) to place constraints on {{the properties of the}} accreting white dwarfs, the high energy emission mechanisms of white dwarfs, and the large-scale accretion flows of Polars and IPS. IPS and Polars are white dwarf mass-transfer binaries, members of the larger class of cata,clysmic variables. They differ from the bulk of the cataclysmic variables in that they contain strongly magnetic white dwarfs; the white dwarfs in Polars have B, = 7 to 230 MG and those in IPS have B, less than 10 MG. The IPS and Polars are both examples of <b>funneled</b> accretion <b>flows</b> in strong magnetic field systems. The IPS are similar to x-ray pulsars in that accretion disks form in the systems which are disrupted by the strong stellar magnetic fields of the white dwarfs near the stellar surface from where the plasma is funneled {{to the surface of the}} white dwarf. The localized hot spots formed at the footpoints of the funnels coupled with the rotation of the white dwarf leads to coherent pulsed x-ray emission. The Polars offer an example of a different accretion topology; the magnetic field of the white dwarf controls the accretion flow from near the inner Lagrangian point of the system directly to the stellar surface. Accretion disks do not form. The strong magnetic coupling generally leads to synchronous orbital/rotational motion in the Polars. The physical system in this sense resembles the Io/Jupiter system. In both IPS and Polars, pulsed emission from the infrared to x-rays is produced as the <b>funneled</b> <b>flows</b> merge onto the white dwarfs through the formation of strong radiating shock waves. A comparative study of the IPS and Polars can elucidate the primary effects of the magnetic fields on the dynamics and thermodynamics in accreting white dwarf systems...|$|R
