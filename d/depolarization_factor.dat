40|$|THE MAIN goal of {{this paper}} is the <b>depolarization</b> <b>factor</b> (DF) of {{arbitrarily}} shaped polarizable inclusion in 2 -D heterostructures. Since analytical calculation of the response of an arbitrary composite material is typically intractable, numerical simulation is the standard method to extract the effective properties of these complex media. For that purpose we use a finite-element (FE) methodology to derive the effective permittivity of the mixed medium. As an illustrative application of this techAn understanding of the polarization characteristics is vital to the rational design of future dielectric nanostructures. In this work, a finite-element methodology has been applied to simulate 2 -D two-phase heterostructures containing a dielectric inclusion with arbitrary shape. The development does not impose any restriction on the shape of the inclusion. Given the paucity of experimental and numerical data, we set out to investigate systematically the trends that shape and permittivity contrast between the inclusion and the host matrix have on the <b>depolarization</b> <b>factor</b> (DF). The effect of the first- versus second-order concentration virial coefficient on the value of the DF is considered for a variety of inclusion shapes and a large set of material properties. Our findings suggest that the DF for a 2 -D inclusion is highly tunable depending on the choice of these parameters. These results can provide a useful insight for the design of artificial two-phase heterostructures with specific polarization properties...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{treats the}} problem of calculating the {{macroscopic}} effective properties of dielectric mixtures where both the inclusions and the background medium can be anisotropic. For this homogenization process, the Maxwell Garnett -type approach is used where the inclusions {{are assumed to be}} spherical and embedded in a homogeneous background medium. The anisotropy of the background medium has to be described with a symmetric permittivity dyadic but the inclusion may be fully anisotropic, in other words the inclusion permittivity dyadic can contain an antisymmetric component. The effect of the anisotropy of the background is such that the <b>depolarization</b> <b>factors</b> of the spheres become different in different directions, even if the geometry is isotropic. This effect has {{to be taken into account}} for the calculation of the polarizability dyadic. As an example, numerical values are calculated for the case of gyrotropic spheres in anisotropic environment, both for the polarizability and effective permittivity dyadics. Finally, some thoughts are raised concerning the physical interpretation of the anisotropy effect, as well as the reciprocity of the materials and symmetry of their permittivities...|$|R

In this letter we extract the spectral density function of cobalt-amorphous aluminum oxide composites from optical and near-infrared data. The spectral functions are accurately computed numerically {{with the help of}} a recently developed technique. It is observed that the spectral features of the prepared composites change with increasing cobalt content. For low concentrations of cobalt, only one depolarization peak is found that corresponds to the Maxwell Garnett approximation. For concentrations higher than 11 % cobalt, three effective <b>depolarization</b> <b>factors</b> are resolved that move towards low spectral parameter values with increasing cobalt content. Such a multi-peak structure arises naturally in fractal equivalent Circuit models for the optical properties. A comparison with a deterministic fractal model is presented to illustrate the strength of the spectral density representation and to better comprehend our results.

By including occultation and depolarization, {{it is found that}} B-star envelopes are necessarily highly flattened disk-type structures. For a disk viewed edge-on, the effect of occultation reduces the polarization more than the inclusion of the <b>depolarization</b> <b>factor</b> alone.

40|$|In {{this paper}} it is {{shown that the}} {{enhancement}} factor of the local electric field in metal covered ellipsoidal nanoparticles embedded in a dielectric host matrix has two maxima at two different frequencies. The second maximum for the metal covered inclusions with large dielectric core (small metal fraction $p$) is comparatively large. This maximum strongly depends on the <b>depolarization</b> <b>factor</b> of the core $L_{z}^{(1) }$, keeping that of the shell $L_{z}^{(2) }$ constant and is less than $L_{z}^{(1) }$. If {{the frequency of the}} external radiation approaches the frequency of surface plasmons of a metal, the local field in the particle considerably increases. The importance of maximum value of enhancement factor $|A|^{ 2 }$ of the ellipsoidal inclusion is emphasized in the case where the dielectric core exceeds metal fraction of the inclusion.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we study the {{response}} of an ellipsoidal particle with a dielectrically anisotropic coating (the coating dielectric function being different parallel and perpendicular to the coating normal) placed in a constant external electric field. For the coating region we find that potential can be written in terms of solutions to a one-dimensional Heun's equation which {{is derived from the}} three-dimensional Gauss equation for the potential in ellipsoidal coordinates. We give solutions to Heun's equation in three forms: for the general case we obtain solutions in terms of a series expansion. For the case of spheroidal particles we write the solutions using hypergeometric functions. For large coating anisotropy we derive a simple form of the solution for the potential. The inside of the ellipsoid and the surroundings are assumed dielectrically isotropic and the potential is therefore given by standard results. By matching the solutions across the boundaries we obtain the ellipsoidal particle polarizability, which is written in terms of the standard <b>depolarization</b> <b>factors</b> and logarithmic derivatives of the Heun's equation solutions.

40|$|Two {{different}} formalisms for the homogenization of {{composite materials}} containing ellipsoidal inclusions based on Bruggeman's original formula for spherical inclusions {{can be found}} in the literature. Both approximations determine the effective macroscopic permittivity of such an idealized composite assuming randomly distributed dielectric particles of equal shape and differ only in the definition of the <b>depolarization</b> <b>factors.</b> The two approaches are applied to analyze ellipsometric Mueller matrix spectra acquired in the visible and near-infrared spectral region from metal and semiconductor slanted columnar thin films. Furthermore, the effective dielectric function tensor generated by the two Bruggeman formalisms is compared to effective major axes dielectric functions individually determined with a homogeneous biaxial layer approach. Best-match model parameters of all three model approaches are discussed and compared to estimates from scanning electron microscope images. The structural parameters obtained from all three optical modeling approaches agree well with the electron microscopy technique.

40|$|Heterogeneous {{two-dimensional}} layers {{have been}} the subjects of many ellipsometric studies. An unambiguous characterization of especially metal heterogeneous layers is not straightforward. Adsorption of Au nanocolloids leads to a well-defined heterogeneous layer, although the analysis of ellipsometric spectra is not simple. Standard effective medium theories are shown not {{to be capable of}} a correct description. The thin island film theory developed by Bedeaux and Vlieger (Optical properties of surface Imperial College Press (2002)), which evaluates a spherical Au colloid as an excess polarizability at the surface, provides a good framework for the analysis. Both the image dipole and the lateral distribution can be incorporated in a straightforward manner. The influence of the change in particle shape from spherical to prolate is evaluated and shows that already a small change in shape leads to large influences in the optical response. This strong effect is due to the influence of shape on the <b>depolarization</b> <b>factors</b> and especially due to the large optical contrast between the Au colloids and the ambient. In contrast to this, the adsorption of the strongly aspherical protein fibrinogen can be analyzed straightforwardly. Only the adsorbed amount of protein on the surface is recorded in-situ.
