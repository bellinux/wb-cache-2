50|$|The imbu can {{be eaten}} fresh or made into jams or other {{sweetened}} preserves like fruit cheese. In the Sertão, it is cooked down until the peel and the pulp separate.

In addition to the thick paste made by this long, slow boiling process, the imbu is the base of fruit juice, vinagre (the juice pressed from overripe fruit), and jam (made by pressing together layers of dried imbu paste). Another delicacy is the compôte made by mixing the fruit and sugar together in jars. The <b>fresh</b> <b>pulp,</b> or if the fresh fruit is not in season, the vinagre is mixed with milk and sugar to make umbuzada, a rich beverage that is a common substitute for a full meal.

However most techniques require long experimental times and high costs to determine antioxidant capacity of hydrophilic or lipophilic compound in a food mixture. By means of a photochemiluminescence method (PCL), we assessed the Integral Antioxidant Capacity (IAC) which represents the sum of the antioxidant capacity of hydrophilic and lipophilic antioxidants. In this study the IAC of extracts from Adansonia digitatata (i. e. red fiber, fruit pulp and leaves), was assessed in comparison to those deriving from other natural sources of antioxidants (i. e. orange, kiwi, apple and strawberry).

40|$|Introduction. Detarium senegalense J. F. Gmel is {{a forest}} tree found in Senegal whose fruits are locally called ditax in Wolof. It is eaten fresh {{but it is}} widely used as nectar, {{which is one of}} the most popular {{beverages}} in Senegal. However, the chemical characterization of ditax pulp remains incomplete. This paper describes the volatile compounds of ditax to assess its organoleptic qualities. Materials and methods. Free volatile compounds of fresh ditax pulp were isolated by solvent-assisted flavor evaporation and analysis by GC-MS. Results and discussion. Among the 53 compounds tentatively identified, 49 are reported for the first time in this fruit. In total, 17 aldehydes, 11 aliphatic alcohols, 1 terpene alcohol, 7 free fatty acids, 3 unsaturated hydrocarbons, 1 terpene hydrocarbon, 7 sesquiterpene hydrocarbons, 1 phenol, 2 ketones, 2 esters and 1 organic acid compound were tentatively identified in ditax <b>fresh</b> <b>pulp.</b> The main volatiles identified in fresh ditax pulp were trans, cis- 2, 6 -nonadienal (2. 47 mg×kg– 1), cis- 2 -heptenal (1. 93 mg×kg– 1), trans-a-bergamotene (1. 11 mg×kg– 1), bicyclo [2, 2, 0] hexane- 1 -carboxaldehyde (0. 80 mg×kg– 1), butyl octadecanoate (0. 55 mg×kg– 1) and trans- 2 -nonenal (0. 47 mg×kg– 1 <b>fresh</b> <b>pulp).</b> Conclusion. Among the volatile compounds identified, aldehyde compounds were widely predominant. To assess the aromatic qualities of ditax pulp, the primary impact aromas should be determined by identifying the aroma-active compounds by GC-olfactometry. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Olive is a rich source of valuable nutrients and bioactives of medicinal and therapeutic interest. Olive fruit contains appreciable concentration, 1 – 3 % of <b>fresh</b> <b>pulp</b> weight, of hydrophilic (phenolic acids, phenolic alchohols, flavonoids and secoiridoids) and lipophilic (cresols) phenolic compounds that are known to possess multiple biological activities such as antioxidant, anticarcinogenic, antiinflammatory, antimicrobial, antihypertensive, antidyslipidemic, cardiotonic, laxative, and antiplatelet. Other important compounds present in olive fruit are pectin, organic acids, and pigments. Virgin olive oil (VOO), extracted mechanically from the fruit, is also very popular for its nutritive and health-promoting potential, especially against cardiovascular disorders due to the presence of high levels of monounsaturates and other valuable minor components such as phenolics, phytosterols, tocopherols, carotenoids, chlorophyll and squalene.

40|$|AbstractAraçá or {{strawberry}} guava (Psidium cattleianum Sabine) {{is an attractive}} tasty small fruit native to temperate zones of Brazil. In this study, functional chemical constituents and the nutraceutical and therapeutic potential of aqueous and acetone extracts of red and yellow accessions of araçá were characterised. While carotenes, ascorbic acid, and anthocyanins were present as minor constituents, araçá fruit presented high levels of phenolic compounds (up to 768 mg 100 g− 1 <b>fresh</b> fruit <b>pulp,</b> ffp), particularly (−) -epicatechin (up to 2. 7 mgg− 1 ffp), which were in general more efficiently extracted with acetone. Abundance of phenolic compounds {{was positively correlated with}} antioxidant activity, antimicrobial and antiproliferative effects...|$|R
40|$|Rocha Pear (Pyrus communis L.) is {{the main}} {{cultivar}} produced in Portugal, and is classified as Protected Designation of Origin (PDO). Pear production represents a significant economic activity in Portugal (c. a. 190. 000 tonnes per year), and the cultivar Rocha represents 95 % of the National Product [1]. The pear contains sugars, vitamins, organic acids, polyphenols and minerals in considerable concentrations [2]. Pears are, usually, eaten fresh when ripe. However, {{the increase in the}} supply of processed products, particularly subjected to drying [3], may provide an opportunity for development and enable the provision of alternative products to consumers. The drying of fruits is a very ancient practice for food preservation still in use nowadays, once the process significantly reduces water activity [4]. In this work, pears of the variety Rocha harvested at different orchards (five different origins) were studied, fresh and dehydrated at two temperatures, 40 and 60 ºC, to determine and compare their sugar composition. This determination was made separately to the pulp and peel from each location. The results showed that pulps contained a higher amount of sugars (6 - 15 %) than peels, both fresh and dried. Additionally, it was possible to verify that the drying treatment caused a reduction (35 - 50 %) in the total amount of sugars. Sugar analysis showed that the relative composition of <b>fresh</b> <b>pulps</b> and peels was similar, both composed mainly by mannose, followed by sorbitol and glucose. The drying process reduced glucose levels and increased the relative amount of mannose in pulps, while sorbitol and manose increased in peels...|$|R
50|$|Boring {{their way}} upwards from one bamboo {{internode}} to another, the larvae {{feed on the}} <b>fresh</b> inner <b>pulp</b> of the bamboo while avoiding common predators such as birds. After 45 to 60 days, the larvae mature and migrate down to the internode containing the exit hole where they enter a period of diapause for eight months, hanging upside down {{from the roof of}} the internode. This long period of diapause is exceptional for a tropical insect, and probably caused by the monsoonal character of the region which has a cool, dry period from November to February, a hot season from March to June, followed by a wet period from June through October, affecting the availability of food for the larvae. The pupal phase takes 46 to 60 days and falls in June and July.|$|R
