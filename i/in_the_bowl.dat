5|$|As {{champions of}} the Atlantic Coast Conference, Virginia Tech was awarded an {{automatic}} bid to the Orange Bowl game. The automatic ACC bid {{was the result of}} an off-season deal following the inaugural ACC Championship Game which granted the winner of the ACC Championship Game an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl unless it was ranked high enough <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series standings to play in the National Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|In the {{off-season}} following the ACC Championship Game and Florida State's selection by the Orange Bowl, the Orange Bowl committee {{announced it would}} be entering into an exclusive contract with the ACC to grant {{the winner of the}} ACC Championship Game an automatic bid to the Orange Bowl unless it was ranked high enough <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series standings to play in the BCS National Championship Game.|$|E
5|$|The other conference tie-in {{was with}} the WAC, which has {{generally}} fielded its champion in the game. The WAC has provided a team for the Humanitarian Bowl every year since 2001. Initially, it was speculated that the WAC championship team, Boise State, would make its fifth appearance <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> played in its home stadium.|$|E
50|$|Ten teams {{participated in}} bowl games.

5|$|With its win, Virginia Tech {{clinched}} {{an automatic}} bid to the 2008 Orange Bowl. This caused ripple effects <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> destinations for virtually every bowl-eligible ACC team. In the 2007 season, the ACC had guaranteed tie-ins with eight bowl games.|$|E
5|$|Texas won {{the game}} 52–17 and moved into first place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series (BCS) standings {{for the first time}} since they were {{implemented}} in 1998. The BCS formula took into account strength of schedule so that teams received more credit for beating stronger opponents. This allowed Texas to advance in the rankings since they beat an unbeaten team while University of Southern California, who previously held the numberone spot, beat Washington, a 1–6 team.|$|E
5|$|The 2012 edition was {{the first}} {{appearance}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> for both Arizona and for the Pac-12. Arizona, seventh best {{in the nation in}} total offense (521.83 ypg), was led by quarterback Matt Scott (338.45 ypg, 3,238 yards passing), All-American running back Ka'Deem Carey who led the nation in rushing (146.42 ypg) and set a school record with his 1,757 rushing yards, good for 21 touchdowns, and wide receiver Austin Hill who totaled 1,189 yards. 2012 {{was the first}} season in Arizona's history during which they had a 3000-yard passer, a 1000-yard rusher, and a 1000-yard receiver. Senior place kicker John Bonano was named the 2012 Pac-12 Football Scholar-Athlete of the Year (Physiology major with a 3.927 GPA).|$|E
50|$|A record nine conference teams {{played in}} a post-season bowl game, with six winning. Arizona, the South Division Champion, was also a bowl game loser, losing to Boise State 38-30 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Fiesta <b>Bowl.</b> Bowl game winners were: Arizona State {{defeated}} Duke 36-31 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Sun <b>Bowl,</b> Stanford defeated Maryland 45-21 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Foster Farms <b>Bowl,</b> UCLA defeated Kansas State 40-35 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Alamo <b>Bowl,</b> USC defeated Nebraska 45-42 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Holiday <b>Bowl,</b> and Utah defeated Colorado State 45-10 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Las Vegas <b>Bowl.</b>|$|R

5|$|The {{students}} then visited {{the home of}} Ralph Cooper Hutchison, the president of Lafayette College. Upon their arrival, President Hutchison told the students that David Showell was not invited to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game because he was an African American. Hutchison further explained that the Sun Bowl Committee's decision to exclude Showell ultimately led to the faculty's rejection of the bowl game bid. The student protestors asked that a conditional acceptance {{be made to the}} bid as long as they allowed David Showell to play.|$|E
5|$|The two losses, piled {{upon the}} loss to Georgia Tech, left Clemson with a 2–3 record. An {{anonymous}} report said coach Swinney became involved in a shouting match with a position coach, while players called a private meeting {{in an effort to}} turn the team's season around. On October 17, The Tigers rallied from their losing streak by defeating Wake Forest, 38–3, and moved back {{into the middle of the}} competition for the Atlantic Division championship. One week after defeating Wake Forest, the Tigers traveled to Miami, Florida, to play the Miami Hurricanes, who were ranked No. 10 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series Poll. The Tigers played the Hurricanes into overtime, then upset Miami with a touchdown, 40–37.|$|E

50|$|The 2002 and 2006 Rose <b>Bowls</b> {{represented}} <b>the</b> National Championship game.

5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} {{to play in the}} 1995 Sugar Bowl by virtue of winning the Big East football championship. The Hokies, who finished 92 during the regular season, actually were co-Big East champions. The University of Miami, which tied the Hokies, was ineligible for post-season play due to sanctions imposed as a result of recruiting rules violations. The Hokies played the University of Texas, which finished 1011 during the regular season en route to becoming Southwest Conference champions. The Southwest Conference was scheduled to disband after the football season, but its champion was guaranteed one of the at-large spots <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance.|$|E
5|$|During the 1996 season, the Orange Bowl was {{a member}} of the Bowl Alliance, a {{precursor}} to the modern Bowl Championship Series. The Bowl Alliance was formed prior to the 1995 college football season in an effort to match the No. 1 and No. 2 teams at the conclusion of the regular season while also ensuring other high-ranking teams were allowed to participate in high-profile bowl games. The Alliance included the Southeastern Conference, Big 12 Conference, Atlantic Coast Conference, and Big East Conference. As agreed, the champions of each conference would play in one of three Bowl Alliance games: the Orange Bowl, Sugar Bowl, and Fiesta Bowl. The Big Ten and Pac-10 conferences, which had a separate agreement with the Rose Bowl, were not included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance until 1998, when the Alliance became the Bowl Championship Series.|$|E
5|$|Following {{the last}} week of {{regularly}} scheduled conference games, both teams fell in the national college football polls because of their rivalry losses. Georgia Tech, which had been No. 7 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series Poll, No. 7 in the Associated Press Poll, and No. 7 in the USA Today Coaches' Poll, dropped to No. 10 in the BCS Poll, No. 12 in the AP Poll, and No. 12 in the coaches' poll. Clemson, which had been No. 18 in the BCS, No. 15 in the AP, and No. 16 according to the coaches, dropped out of the BCS and coaches' polls and was No. 25 according to the AP. Spread bettors predicted Georgia Tech would win the game. Various betting organizations favored the Yellow Jackets by one point.|$|E

5|$|In {{the first}} weeks after the matchup was announced, Virginia Tech sold its {{allotment}} of 15,000 tickets, while Nebraska sales lagged, only reaching the 5,000 mark {{in the time it}} took Tech to sell its allotment. The slow Nebraska sales were largely due to fans who had booked trips to the Sugar Bowl in anticipation of a victory by the Cornhuskers in the Big 12 championship game. Disappointed by the loss, many people elected not to make the trip to Miami. By December 27, four days prior to the game, Tech had increased its total to 15,500, while Nebraska improved to 8,000 sold. The game was the first Orange Bowl to be played at Miami's professional football arena, Pro Player Stadium, instead of Orange Bowl stadium. The move was made in order to secure the Orange Bowl's place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Alliance, as Pro Player Stadium was a more modern facility with a larger seating capacity.|$|E
5|$|Injuries had {{devastated the}} Maryland roster the {{previous}} year, and while 2008 was more forgiving by comparison, several key players were injured. Starting cornerback Kevin Barnes suffered a season-ending scapular fracture against Wake Forest {{and missed the}} last six games. Sophomore LaQuan Williams and true freshman Kevin Dorsey, both wide receivers, sat out the entire season due to leg and foot injuries, respectively. Leading receiver Darrius Heyward-Bey sat out the Boston College game due to a calf injury, and leading rusher Da'Rel Scott suffered a left shoulder injury in the third game against California, which plagued him throughout the season, although he missed just one game. Running back Morgan Green, who had contended for the starting position during summer camp, had an injury-riddled season, before seeing his first real action <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game. Starting quarterback Jordan Steffy was put {{out for the season}} by a thumb injury on his throwing hand in the first game.|$|E
5|$|The 1948 {{season was}} one of the most {{successful}} years for the Lafayette College football team. Led by captain Danny Kovacs and standout running back David Showell, the team had a record of seven wins and two losses. After starting the year beating Fordham University by a score of 53 to 14, Lafayette suffered a large loss in its following game at Army, losing 54 to 7. The Leopards then won each of their next four games by an average scoring margin of 26 points, but they soon lost to Rutgers University by three touchdowns. After defeating Ohio Wesleyan, Lafayette set itself up for a crucial bout against its rival, Lehigh University. However, on November 19, 1948, a day before the game against Lehigh, Lafayette received a phone call from the Sun Bowl Committee inviting the team to participate <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl</b> game. This invitation essentially rendered Lafayette's season finale against Lehigh meaningless. Nevertheless, Lafayette went on to defeat Lehigh by a score of 23 to 13, capping off the regular season.|$|E

5|$|The player {{starts the}} game with three lives. Several {{ingredients}} will fly around the screen simultaneously, and if the player touches an ingredient with their body, a life will be deducted. The player's objective {{is to put the}} ingredients into the cooking bowl before they either fall into the dustbins on either side or knock the player into the bowl. As a defence, Charlie the Cook can shoot flour sacks, which will push the ingredients further in the direction they are moving in. Bombs may also spawn in the game, which will allow the player to push the ingredients further than conventional flour sacks. The player has to push the right variety of ingredients into the bowl, which changes for each level. When the right amount of ingredients has been put <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>bowl,</b> a cake is baked and a new level begins.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech was {{selected}} as {{a participant in the}} game after winning the ACC football championship during the team's first year in the conference. Tech, which finished 10–2 in the regular season prior to the Sugar Bowl, defeated 16th-ranked Virginia and ninth-ranked Miami en route to the game. Auburn finished the regular season undefeated at 12–0. The Tigers defeated fourth-ranked LSU and fifth-ranked Georgia {{during the course of the}} season, and were one of five teams to finish the regular season undefeated; the others were Southern California, Oklahoma, Utah, and Boise State, with USC and Oklahoma being selected to play <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series national championship game. Auburn, by virtue of its lower ranking in the BCS poll, was left out of the national championship and {{was selected}} to play in the Sugar Bowl.|$|E
5|$|With many {{of their}} {{starters}} returning, a highly ranked recruiting class, and a number one ranking before the season, the team had high expectations of repeating as national champions as they had nearly all of their offensive starters returning, although they had only two returning defensive starters from the previous year. The team went undefeated {{in the regular season}} with nine of their twelve wins by 17points or more and were compared with the greatest teams in the history of college football. Once again ranked first <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Bowl</b> Championship Series (BCS) rankings, they were invited to the national championship bowl game at the Rose Bowl, where they lost to the Texas Longhorns. With a final record of 12–1, they finished the season ranked second in the nation in both the Associated Press (AP) and Coaches' Polls.|$|E
