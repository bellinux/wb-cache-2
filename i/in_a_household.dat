5|$|The {{median income}} per {{household}} member was clocked at $24,672 in 2005. This {{means that the}} average Joe earns roughly $32,000 a year, lives <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>household</b> with an income of $46,000 with $24,000 of gross annual income per member. Personal income changes considerably over the life-time of the average American, from $28,000 at age 25 to about $42,000 {{at the age of}} 65.

30|$|Results {{suggest that}} about 23 % of the {{population}} belonging to multidimensional poor <b>households</b> and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment had experienced short-term morbidities <b>in</b> <b>a</b> reference period of 30  days compared to 20 % {{of the population}} belonging to multidimensional non-poor <b>households</b> and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment, 19 % of the population belonging to multidimensional poor <b>households</b> and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment and 15 % of the population belonging to multidimensional non-poor <b>households</b> and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment. Controlling for socioeconomic covariates, the odds of short-term morbidity was 1.47 [CI 1.40 – 1.53] among the multidimensional poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment, 1.28 [CI 1.21 – 1.37] among the multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment and 1.21 [CI 1.64 – 1.28] among the multidimensional poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment compared to the multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment. Results are robust across states and hold good {{for each of the}} three morbidities: fever, cough and diarrhoea. This establishes that along with poverty, household environmental conditions have a significant bearing on short-term morbidities in India. Public investment in sanitation, drinking water and cooking fuel can reduce the morbidity and improve the health of the population.|$|R
30|$|The {{prevalence}} of diarrhoea (Table  2) {{in the month}} preceding the survey was higher in Madhya Pradesh (5.6 %) followed by Uttar Pradesh (4.8 %) and Chhattisgarh (3.6 %). On the other hand, the {{prevalence of}} diarrhoea was lowest {{in the state of}} Kerala (1.3 %). In Uttar Pradesh, among the multidimensional poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment, the prevalence of diarrhoea was 6.7 % compared to 3.8 % among the multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment and 3.5 % each among the multidimensional poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment and the multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment. Also, in eight states (Assam, Madhya Pradesh, Haryana, Gujarat, Jharkhand, Jammu and Kashmir, Andhra Pradesh and Karnataka), it was higher among the multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment. <b>In</b> five states, the prevalence of diarrhoea was higher among the multidimensional poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment, and in majority of the states (13 major states), the prevalence of diarrhoea was lowest among the multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment.|$|R

30|$|Using {{the unit}} {{data from the}} second round of the Indian Human Development Survey (IHDS-II), 2011 – 2012, which covered 42, 152 households, this paper {{examines}} the association between multidimensional poverty, household environmental deprivation and short-term morbidities (fever, cough and diarrhoea) in India. Poverty is measured <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multidimensional framework that includes the dimensions of education, health and income, while household environmental deprivation is defined as lack of access to improved sanitation, drinking water and cooking fuel. A composite index combining multidimensional poverty and household environmental deprivation has been computed, and households are classified as follows: multidimensional poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment, multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment, multidimensional poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment and multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment.|$|R
30|$|By {{combining}} multidimensional {{poverty and}} the index of <b>household</b> environmental deprivation, <b>a</b> composite index of multidimensional poverty and household environmental deprivation was computed and categorised into four categories, namely, multidimensional poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment, multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> poor <b>household</b> environment, multidimensional poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment and multidimensional non-poor and living <b>in</b> <b>a</b> good <b>household</b> environment. Multidimensional poverty and household environmental condition are linked to three short-term morbidities—fever, cough and diarrhoea. The differentials in the prevalence of short-term morbidities are examined by multidimensional poverty and household environmental deprivation. Logistic regression is {{used to examine the}} key predictors of short-term morbidities. About 98 % of the total households have information in all six indicators. We have not included households that had missing values in any of the indicators.|$|R

25|$|As {{with many}} other Papuan groups, the Urapmin {{consider}} the owner of an object or land {{to be the first}} person to create or work it. This is taken to the extent that every object <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>household</b> is considered to have an owner, and some households have even divided their shared gardens into individually owned plots. According to the traditional beliefs of the Urapmin, this fits into a general worldview where everything had an owner, either human or spirit.|$|E

Ration stamps were valid only for a set period to forestall hoarding. All forms of automobile racing were banned, including the Indianapolis 500 which was cancelled from 1942 to 1945.

30|$|Among {{the major}} states of India, the {{prevalence}} of cough (Table  3) was highest (21.6 %) in Uttar Pradesh followed by Chhattisgarh (21.4 %), West Bengal (18.4 %) and Bihar (15.8 %).

25|$|People {{were not}} only {{consuming}} these perishables because it became easier for they themselves to store them, but because the innovations in refrigerated transportation and storage led to less spoilage and waste, thereby driving the prices of these products down.
