5|$|Kris Fowles (Katie Cassidy) {{goes to the}} Springwood Diner to {{meet with}} her ex-boyfriend, Dean Russell (Kellan Lutz), who falls asleep {{at the table and}} meets a man covered in burn scars, wearing a clawed glove on his hand. The burned man cuts Dean's throat in the dream, but in reality it appears that Dean is cutting his own throat as his friend, {{waitress}} Nancy Holbrook (Rooney Mara), looks on with Kris. At Dean's funeral, Kris sees a photograph of her and Dean as children, but cannot recall ever knowing Dean before high school. Kris begins to dream about the burned man herself and refuses to go to sleep for fear that she will die in her dreams. Jesse Braun (Thomas Dekker), Kris's ex-boyfriend, shows up to keep her company while she sleeps, but Kris meets the burned man in her dreams and is murdered. Covered <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood,</b> Jesse runs to Nancy's house and learns that Nancy has been having dreams about the same man: Freddy Krueger (Jackie Earle Haley).|$|E

25|$|After {{nearly two}} months of investigations, federal {{officials}} said on November 10 that the clinic {{made a number of}} mistakes both before and during the procedure. Among those were the clinic's failure to respond to Rivers' deteriorating vital signs, including a severe drop <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood</b> pressure, possibly administering an incorrect anesthetic dosage, performing a surgical procedure without her consent, and other medical-clinic irregularities.|$|E

25|$|His third {{marriage}} was to Nerine Kidd Shatner, from 1997 {{until her death}} in 1999. On August 9, 1999, Shatner returned home around 10p.m. to discover Nerine's body {{at the bottom of}} their backyard swimming pool. She was 40 years old. An autopsy detected alcohol and Valium (diazepam) <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood,</b> but the coroner ruled the cause of death as an accidental drowning. The LAPD ruled out foul play, and the case was closed.|$|E
25|$|BC-819 was {{previously}} tested in human compassionate {{use for the}} treatment of superficial bladder cancer, ovarian cancer and metastatic liver cancer. The bladder cancer patient, who was a candidate for radical cystectomy when he was treated in 2004, reported no cancer recurrence and no side effects. The ovarian cancer patient experienced a 50% decline in the amount of the ovarian cancer marker protein CA-125 <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood</b> as well as a significant {{decrease in the number of}} cancerous cells in her ascitic fluid. The patient suffering from metastatic liver cancer was treated with direct injection of BC-819 into the tumor, with considerable tumor necrosis observed.|$|E
25|$|All cetaceans, {{including}} belugas, have physiological adaptations {{designed to}} conserve oxygen {{while they are}} under water. During a dive, these animals will reduce their heart rate from 100 beats a minute to between 12 and 20. Blood flow is diverted away from certain tissues and organs and towards the brain, heart and lungs, which require a constant oxygen supply. The amount of oxygen dissolved in the blood is 5.5%, which is greater than that found in land-based mammals and {{is similar to that}} of Weddell seals (a diving marine mammal). One study found a female beluga had 16.5 l of oxygen dissolved <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood.</b> Lastly, the beluga's muscles contain high levels of the protein myoglobin, which stores oxygen in muscle. Myoglobin concentrations are several times greater than for terrestrial mammals, which help prevent oxygen deficiency during dives.|$|E

500|$|During {{filming of}} Hackers (1995), Jolie had a romance with British actor Jonny Lee Miller, her first lover since the {{relationship}} {{in her early}} teens. They were not in touch for many months after production ended, but eventually reconnected and married soon after in March 1996. She attended her wedding in black rubber pants and a white T-shirt, upon which she had written the groom's name <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood.</b> Though the relationship ended for good the following year, Jolie remained on good terms with Miller, whom she called [...] "a solid man and a solid friend." [...] Their divorce, initiated by Jolie in February 1999, was finalized shortly before she remarried the next year.|$|E
500|$|A formal inquest in February 1944 {{returned}} a verdict of [...] "Suicide, motive unknown". In his report, the coroner found that Tatlock had eaten a full meal shortly before her death. She had taken some barbiturates, {{but not a}} fatal dose. Traces of chloral hydrate were found, a drug normally associated with a [...] "Mickey Finn" [...] when combined with alcohol, {{but there was no}} alcohol <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood,</b> despite damage to her pancreas that indicated she was a heavy drinker. As a psychiatrist working in a hospital, she had access to sedatives such as chloral hydrate. The coroner found that she had died at around 4:30 pm on January 4. The cause of death was recorded as [...] "acute edema of the lungs with pulmonary congestion" [...] — drowning in the bathtub. It seems likely that she knelt over the bathtub, took chloral hydrate, and plunged her head in the water.|$|E
500|$|Mary was not {{beheaded}} with {{a single}} strike. The first blow missed her neck and struck {{the back of her}} head. The second blow severed the neck, except for a small bit of sinew, which the executioner cut through using the axe. Afterward, he held her head aloft and declared, [...] "God save the Queen." [...] At that moment, the auburn tresses in his hand {{turned out to be a}} wig and the head fell to the ground, revealing that Mary had very short, grey hair. A small dog owned by the queen, a Skye Terrier, is said to have been hiding among her skirts, unseen by the spectators. Following the beheading, it refused to be parted from its owner's body and was covered <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood,</b> until it was forcibly taken away and washed. Items supposedly worn or carried by Mary at her execution are of doubtful provenance; contemporary accounts state that all her clothing, the block, and everything touched by her blood was burnt in the fireplace of the Great Hall to obstruct relic-hunters.|$|E

500|$|The Los Angeles County Coroners Office was {{assisted}} in their investigation by psychiatrists from the Los Angeles Suicide Prevention Team, who had expert knowledge on suicide [...] It was estimated that Monroe had died between 8:30 and 10:30p.m., and the toxicology report later {{revealed that the}} cause of death was acute barbiturate poisoning. She had 8mg% (milligrams per 100 milliliters of solution) chloral hydrate and 4.5mg% of pentobarbital (Nembutal) <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood,</b> and a further 13mg% of pentobarbital in her liver. Empty bottles containing these medicines were found next to her bed. The possibility that Monroe had accidentally overdosed was ruled out, because the dosages found in her body were several times over the lethal limit. Her doctors stated that she had been prone to [...] "severe fears and frequent depressions" [...] with [...] "abrupt and unpredictable" [...] mood changes, and had overdosed several times in the past, possibly intentionally. Due to these facts and the lack of any indication of foul play, the coroner classified her death as a [...] "probable suicide".|$|E
500|$|McConnell's work {{mainly focused}} on poison and blood analysis, and she testified in many {{criminal}} cases {{as an expert}} witness. Her work often involved determining {{the cause of death}} when poisoning was suspected. In 1930, she investigated the death of a ten-year-old Denver girl; the case was referred to at the time as the city's [...] "most famous and controversial murder case". Although she initially suspected the girl had been poisoned, McConnell discovered crushed glass in the girl's stomach and blood stains in the family car; her testimony led to the sentencing of the girl's stepmother for murder. In 1936, McConnell testified against suspected rapist and murderer Joe Arridy after finding fibers from the bedspread at the murder scene under the suspect's fingernails. (Although Arridy was convicted of murder and executed in 1939, he was granted a posthumous pardon in 2011.) McConnell also discovered that murder victim Georg Obendoerfer had been killed with a lethal dose of arsenic, which led to further investigations confirming that Anna Marie Hahn had killed Obendoerfer, as well as other men in the same way. McConnell testified at Hahn's trial in Cincinnati and Hahn was subsequently convicted and executed. After she was called to Raton, New Mexico as a key witness in a murder trial in 1935, a court reporter for the Raton Range wrote that McConnell [...] "has gained a national reputation ... <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood</b> analysis work". Additionally, she is thought to be the United States' first female forensic pathologist. Despite working on numerous high-profile, widely publicized cases, McConnell kept her life as private as possible and only ever gave one interview during her career.|$|E

60|$|Joan ran on, {{stumbling}} over {{rocks and}} brush, with a darkness before her eyes, the terror <b>in</b> <b>her</b> soul. She {{was out in}} the cedars when someone grasped her from behind. She felt the hands as the coils of a snake. Then she was ready to faint, but she must not faint. She struggled away, stood free. It was the man Bill who had caught her. He said something that was unintelligible. She reached for the snag of a dead cedar and, leaning there, fought her weakness, that cold black horror which seemed a physical thing <b>in</b> <b>her</b> mind, <b>her</b> <b>blood,</b> <b>her</b> muscles.|$|R
2500|$|Buck denied these claims, testifying that Lambert had {{actively}} {{participated in}} the murder {{and that she had}} told Buck to [...] "wear her hair up and not to wear make-up or fingernail polish". Yunkin was later brought to the stand and the sweatpants that had been re-introduced in the 1997 trial as belonging to him were produced. Yunkin was ordered to hold the sweatpants up against his body, which were shown to be too short for him and of a different fabric than the pair shown in the 1992 trial. Further evidence and testimony was brought against Lambert such as a relative of Yunkin providing a poem that Lambert had written in jail that described the murder. Crime scene experts also testified that no evidence of Show writing out any initials <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood</b> was found and that other evidence discovered at the crime scene did not corroborate with Lambert's story.|$|E
2500|$|On October 12, Valdez called Trinidad Espinoza to the stand. He {{testified that}} he saw Saldívar {{pointing}} a gun while running after Selena. Saldívar then stopped, lowered the gun, and walked back into her motel room displaying no emotion. After hearing this testimony, Marcella Quintanilla (Selena's mother) experienced chest and arm pains and was hospitalized to treat a sudden rise <b>in</b> <b>her</b> <b>blood</b> pressure. Motel maid Norma Marie Martinez also described the same events as Espinoza, but added that Saldívar had called Selena a [...] "bitch". Tinker asked Martinez to indicate {{where she had been}} on a diagram of the scene of the crime. He believed that Martinez could not have seen or heard anything because she was a considerable distance from the vicinity of the shooting. Emergency room personnel, who attended to Saldívar when Selena drove her to the hospital to be checked for rape, claimed that Saldívar had lied to Selena about the rape as there were inconsistencies between the story she told them and the one she told Selena. Tinker asked the nurse to describe Saldívar's mood at that time. She replied that the Saldívar showed symptoms of depression. Tinker asked if those symptoms were typically found in a victim of sexual assault. The nurse agreed they were. Another nurse who attended to Saldívar stated that she had red welts on her neck and arms, but that they did not resemble the bruises a person would receive from an assault by a baseball bat as Saldívar claimed.|$|E
