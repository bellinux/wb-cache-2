5|$|The Imperfect {{portrays the}} verb as an {{incomplete}} action {{along with the}} process by which <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>about,</b> either as an event that has not begun, an event that has begun but is still in the process, or a habitual or cyclic action that is on an ongoing repetition. The Imperfect can also express modal or conditional verbs, as well as commands in the Jussive and Cohortative moods. While often future tense, it also has uses in the past and present under certain contexts. Biblical Hebrew tense is not necessarily reflected in the verb forms per se, but rather is determined primarily by context. The Participles also reflect ongoing or continuous actions, but are also subject to the context determining their tense.|$|E
25|$|In pre-modern medicine, the {{explanation}} {{given by the}} now-discredited theory of humorism for cannibalism was that <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> within a black acrimonious humor, which, being lodged in the linings of the ventricle, produced the voracity for human flesh.|$|E
25|$|In any case, thus <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> that Richard {{was brought}} up as a Catholic, {{although}} he was not baptized a Roman Catholic until he was about thirteen years old. This was at Warkworth, Northamptonshire, seat of the recusant Roman Catholic family, that of George Holman, whose wife, Lady Anastasia Holman, was a daughter of Blessed William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford, a Catholic unjustly condemned and beheaded in the Titus Oates hysteria of 1678.|$|E

In September 2012 Marquis was unable to pitch for Israel at the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifier due to being active on a major league team. Israel was unable {{to qualify for the}} tournament, making it so Marquis was unable to pitch for Israel.|$|E
25|$|The Battle of Luang Namtha, fought between January 1962 and May 1962, was an {{important}} engagement of the Laotian Civil War. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> {{as a result of}} the turmoil following Laotian independence {{as a result of the}} First Indochina War with France. The Kingdom of Laos had foreign soldiers upon its soil, and a political struggle in progress concerning those outside troops. Following a coup and counter-coup that left General Phoumi Nosavan in charge, the general decided on military action to settle the political issue of interlopers in Laos.|$|E
25|$|Coalition of Secular and Democratic Syrians: {{nucleus of}} a Syrian secular and {{democratic}} opposition that {{appeared during the}} Syrian civil war. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> through the union of a dozen Muslim and Christian, Arab and Kurd parties, who called the minorities of Syria to support {{the fight against the}} government of Bashar al-Assad. The Coalition has also called for military intervention in Syria, under the form of a no-fly zone similar to that of Kosovo, with a safe zone and cities.

25|$|There is {{no known}} fully {{accurate}} history of broomball. The {{consensus is that}} modern broomball originated in Canada. Some think <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> by trying to play ice hockey without ice skates. The first recorded broomball games in North America were in Perdue, Saskatchewan on March 5, 1909, although {{there is some evidence}} to suggest broomball was being played {{in a small town in}} Massey, Ontario. These games, however, were played on a football field as early as the 1890s. From Canada the game spread south to the United States, becoming especially popular in Minnesota, where by the 1960s a broomball community was thriving.|$|E
25|$|He {{was remarkably}} {{consistent}} {{once he had}} won his first team place, {{but when he was}} injured <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> in unusual circumstances. Playing against Middlesex at Lord's, he fell off a chair in the dressing-room as he reached for his clothes and broke his wrist, missing the remainder of the summer of 1921. His benefit match in 1922 against Kent at Headingley, Leeds raised £1,891 and he hit the winning runs, after scoring 20 of the 24 required to win, to secure victory by ten wickets. He suffered from sciatica {{in the latter part of}} his career, and he played his last match for Yorkshire in 1927.|$|E
25|$|Several anecdotes {{are known}} about Ansuini. He liked to mock the gendarmes, leaving signed fliers {{in the same}} {{restaurants}} {{where he used to}} eat. Once he went elegantly dressed to Bassano in Teverina and entered the barracks of carabinieri {{in the name of a}} trade man on travel from Milan. On his request, he had an escort of two gendarmes, for personal protection during his journey. At the end he asked the two men to deliver a flyer to their commander. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> that the commander expressed all his anger when he read the paper with the signature of Ansuini. The phenomenon of brigandage was close to being extinguished. Ansuini disappeared after a fight with carabinieri. Menichetti was captured after killing the brigadier Sebastiano Preta, and died in prison.|$|E

25|$|For {{this work}} Airy {{received}} in 1848 a testimonial from the Royal Astronomical Society, and {{it at once}} led to the discovery by Peter Andreas Hansen of two new inequalities in the moon's motion. After completing these reductions, Airy made inquiries, before engaging in any theoretical investigation in connection with them, whether any other mathematician was pursuing the subject, and learning that Hansen had taken it in hand under the patronage of the king of Denmark, but that, owing {{to the death of}} the king and the consequent lack of funds, there was danger of his being compelled to abandon it, he applied to the admiralty on Hansen's behalf for the necessary sum. His request was immediately granted, and thus <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> that Hansen's famous Tables de la Lune were dedicated to La Haute Amirauté de sa Majesté la Reine de la Grande Bretagne et d'Irlande.|$|E
25|$|It was in {{this climate}} that Matthew Barnett formed a {{partnership}} 'Barnett and Grant'. <b>It</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> because Peter Grant had been banned from a racecourse for refusing to leave. Barnett, who had earlier been banned from the same course for life, but who {{had managed to get}} that decision overturned, offered to Grant to bet on a joint account. A win of £100 resulted and although the two never formalised their partnership, their further wins in this first year ran into the thousands. Luck left them, and after the second year they had lost all their earnings again. Luck was with them again, and some time after Grant's wedding in February 1896, they had sufficient capital to add a branch in Christchurch to their existing betting shop in Dunedin. Initially, the Dunedin business had to financially support the Christchurch branch, but under Barnett's business leadership in Christchurch, the situation changed and Christchurch supported the Dunedin branch. The Christchurch premises were in the central city at 174 Hereford Street, and from 1905 {{on the opposite side of}} the road at 163 Hereford Street.|$|E
25|$|He {{then set}} before them the {{advantage}} which the moment presented {{for an attack}} upon Fort Caroline, with its defenses weakened {{by the absence of}} Ribault who might have taken the best part of its garrison with him, and Ribault's inability to return against the contrary wind, which in his judgment would continue for some days. His plan was to reach the fort through the forest and to attack it. If his approach was discovered, he proposed, on reaching the margin of the woods which surrounded the open meadow where it stood, to display the banners {{in such a way as}} to lead the French to believe that his force was two thousand strong. A trumpeter should then be sent to summon them to surrender, in which case the garrison should be sent back to France, and, if they did not, put to the knife. In the event of failure the Spaniards would have become acquainted with the way, and could await at St. Augustine the arrival of reinforcements in March. Although his plan failed to meet with general approval at first, it was finally agreed upon, and so <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>about</b> that Menéndez was able to write to the King in his letter of October 15 that his captains had approved his plan.|$|E

500|$|In {{the same}} interview, Gates said: [...] "I agree {{with people like}} Richard Dawkins that mankind felt the need for {{creation}} myths. Before we really began to understand disease and the weather and things like that, we sought false explanations for them. Now science has filled {{in some of the}} realm– not all– that religion used to fill. But the mystery and the beauty of the world is overwhelmingly amazing, and there's no scientific explanation of how <b>it</b> <b>came</b> <b>about.</b> To say that it was generated by random numbers, that does seem, you know, sort of an uncharitable view [...] I think it makes sense to believe in God, but exactly what decision in your life you make differently because of it, I don't know." ...|$|E

500|$|It did {{not take}} long for Villa to lift their first League Championship trophy, and this was {{achieved}} in 1893–94. Villa were soon attracting large crowds; the club could regularly expect 25,000 people to attend home games. This was {{at a time when}} the FA Cup Final would attract only about 20,000. With poor spectator facilities and an uneven pitch, the Wellington Road ground was increasingly unsuitable, and in 1897 Villa's financial secretary Frederick Rinder negotiated the purchase of their current home ground, the Aston Lower Grounds. In the 1899-1900 season [...] became the top goalscorer in world football scoring 27 goals in just 33 league games and a total 30 goals in 39 league and cup games.
