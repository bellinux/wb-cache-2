25|$|Robert Dollar {{expressed}} ideas concerning one's legacy after death. He wrote: In {{this world}} all we leave behind us {{that is worth}} anything <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> be well regarded and spoken of after we are gone, {{and that we can}} say that we left the world just a little better than we found it. If we can't accomplish these two things then life, according to my view, has been a failure. Many people erroneously speak of a man when he is gone as having left so much money. That, according to my view, amounts to very little.|$|E
25|$|Also, {{an obvious}} riposte <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> {{aggregate}} capital simply {{by using the}} first set of prices and ignoring the second, as with many inflation corrections. This does not work, however, because the variation of the rate of profit is theorized as happening at a specific point in time in purely mathematical terms rather than as part of an historical process. The point is that if neoclassical conceptions do not work at a specific time (statics), they cannot handle the more complicated issues of dynamics. This critique of the neoclassical conception is more of a matter of pointing out its major technical flaws in the theory than of presenting an alternative.|$|E

500|$|Youth {{development}} and scouring for talent abroad {{is central to}} Wenger's recruitment policy. He relies on a network of scouts and personal contacts to find and attract talented footballers to play under him. Wenger's strategy is aided by data; for instance, the decision to sign Flamini in 2004 came about as {{he was looking at}} statistics to find an understudy to Vieira. To examine the mental state of a young footballer, he uses psychometric tests conducted by psychologist Jacques Crevoisier once every two years. Wenger prides himself on nurturing talent, saying in an interview: [...] "I believe {{one of the best things}} about managing people <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> influence lives in a positive way. That's basically what a manager is about. When I can do that, I am very happy".|$|E

[...] Alonso added that he had confidence in the car to perform at the remaining Grands Prix: [...] "The feeling I have now <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> do anything". Kubica said that his second-placed finish was better than his win at the Canadian Grand Prix earlier in the season. He added that to finish on the podium after BMW Sauber's failure to improve the car {{from the beginning of the}} season was a [...] "great result for the team in, I think, a very difficult moment". Räikkönen said that he was [...] "a bit disappointed because being in first place in the first corner but then being pushed out didn't help and being in the front could have given us a better result but anyhow, that's racing". He added that Kovalainen's impact with him at the first corner had caused handling difficulties in his car, which left him unable to improve on his third-placed finish.|$|E

2500|$|In {{spite of}} these decisions, the Second Circuit had ruled {{in this case that}} the {{religious}} nature of the Good News Club's message meant that it [...] "fell outside the bounds of" [...] speech related to [...] "pure moral and character development", and hence was not entitled to First Amendment protection. [...] The majority on the Supreme Court [...] "disagreed that something that is 'quintessentially religious' or 'decidedly religious in nature' cannot also be characterized properly as the teaching of morals and character development from a particular viewpoint. [...] What matters for purposes of the Free Speech Clause <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> see no logical difference in kind between the invocation of Christianity by the Club and the invocation of teamwork, loyalty, or patriotism by other associations to provide a foundation for their lessons." [...] Instruction related to morals and values from a religious perspective does not somehow [...] "taint" [...] that instruction so as to alter the viewpoint such instruction takes.

2500|$|One {{prominent}} {{exemplar of}} the tradition is John Rawls. In The Law of Peoples, Rawls extends the method of his A Theory of Justice {{to the question of}} global justice. His argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> justify a global regime by showing that it would be chosen by representatives of Peoples in an imagined original position, which prevents them knowing which particular People they represent. [...] This decision-in-ignorance models fairness because it excludes selfish bias. [...] When Rawls applied this method in the case of domestic justice, with parties in the original position representing individual members of a single society, he argued that it supported a redistributive, egalitarian liberal politics. In contrast, Rawls argues that when his method is applied to global justice, it supports a quite traditional, Kantian international ethics: duties of states to obey treaties and strict limits on warmaking, but no global repossession of private property. [...] So, different justices apply to the domestic and international cases. [...] Even if justice requires egalitarianism within states, it does not do so between them. [...] And a system of cooperating but independent states is the just global institutional arrangement. [...] Rawls describes this ideal as a 'realistic utopia'. Apart from Rawls, other notable exponents of this position include Hedley Bull.|$|E

2500|$|Just as he {{challenged}} the dominant analytic–synthetic distinction, Quine also {{took aim at}} traditional normative epistemology. [...] According to Quine, traditional epistemology tried to justify the sciences, but this effort (as exemplified by Rudolf Carnap) failed, and so we should replace traditional epistemology with an empirical study of what sensory inputs produce what theoretical outputs.: [...] "Epistemology, or something like it, simply falls into place as a chapter of psychology and hence of natural science. It studies a natural phenomenon, viz., a physical human subject. This human subject is accorded a certain experimentally controlled input — certain patterns of irradiation in assorted frequencies, for instance — and in the fullness of time the subject delivers as output {{a description of the}} three-dimensional external world and its history. The relation between the meager input and the torrential output is a relation that we are prompted to study for somewhat the same reasons that always prompted epistemology: namely, in order to see how evidence relates to theory, and in what ways one's theory of nature transcends any available evidence...But a conspicuous difference between old epistemology and the epistemological enterprise in this new psychological setting <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> now make free use of empirical psychology."

2500|$|By [...] "necessary connection", Hume {{means the}} power or force which {{necessarily}} ties one idea to another. He rejects {{the notion that}} any sensible qualities are necessarily conjoined, since that would mean we could know something prior to experience. Unlike his predecessors, Berkeley and Locke, Hume rejects the idea that volitions or impulses of the will may be inferred to necessarily connect to the actions they produce by way of {{some sense of the}} power of the will. He reasons that, 1. if we knew the nature of this power, then the mind-body divide would seem totally unmysterious to us; 2. if we had immediate knowledge of this mysterious power, then we would be able to intuitively explain why it <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>we</b> <b>can</b> control some parts of our bodies (e.g., our hands or tongues), and not others (e.g., the liver or heart); 3. we have no immediate knowledge of the powers which allow an impulse of volition to create an action (e.g., of the [...] "muscles, and nerves, and animal spirits" [...] which are the immediate cause of an action). (Hume 1974:353-354) He produces like arguments against the notion that we have knowledge of these powers as they affect the mind alone. (Hume 1974:355-356) He also argues in brief against the idea that causes are mere occasions of the will of some god(s), a view associated with the philosopher Nicolas Malebranche.

The highlight of the regular season was a 67-55 road victory over arch-rival and perennial women's basketball power #4 ranked Stanford.
