Script recognitions have many important applications like automatic transcription of multilingual documents, searching document <b>image,</b> <b>script</b> sorting. Proposed work emphasis on the “block level technique ” which is conquered with manual which compromises Training, Calculating Error and Modifying Weights. A problem where script recognition recognizes the encountered with a 20 x 20 matrix is time-consuming training compression and script of the given document in a mixture of various script documents. Feature extraction technique is an important step in Script recognition. In this project, we have used combined approach of Discrete Cosine Transform (DCT) and discrete wavelets Transform (DWT) for feature extraction and neural network(feedforward back propagation) classifier for classification and recognition purpose.

40|$|A Reading Film. Exercises in IntermedialityThe {{compound}} neologism reading film combines {{reading and}} moving <b>image,</b> <b>script</b> and watching. Thus, the classic core concept film  in which image, sound and word are forged and welded together to support {{one another in}} a complementary way, in order to drag the audience in the filmic fiction experience  is set aside. Once detached from the codes and formulas from mainstream film, the potentialities of the media combination between moving image and word can be significantly extended, especially when the syntaxes of cinematic and linguistic language get unlocked, as in experimental film and poetry. The maker of a reading film, however, has to walk a tightrope: by combining word and image, the work becomes a sort of double space (and hence, a double time) that we could call a small multiverse in which two different codes act upon the imagination of the spectator. Or to put it with Marcel Broodthaers: « La grande difficulté, cest évidemment lharmonie entre ces éléments. » (The difficult thing, of course, is the harmony between these elements. ) Therefore, the main question of the research project A Reading Film is as simple as the answer is complex: how can text, in the form of script, and image, as moving photographic images, be combined? In order to gain control over the working process that incorporates filming, writing and editing, one needs {{a deeper understanding of the}} combined effect of word and image. The research aims at generating useful insights into this matter. The search follows three parallel trails. My personal experience in experimenting with reading films (hence the exercises in the subtitle), functions as compass for the research (practice led research), i. a. to determine which new experiments can be set up, or to give direction to the two other trails: assembling relevant theory, and looking at relevant practices. Theory on intermediality (e. g. W. J. T. Mitchell, R. Krauss, I. Rajewsky) refines and nuances the frame for word-image combinations, beyond the different ways of representation that both media embody prototypically; information from neuropsychological research supplies insights in the reading process; directions for subtitling translate this into practice. Furthermore, detailed discussions of practical examples  title sequences, intertitles, experimental films, poetry films  unveil the complexity that resides in the word-image combination. Inevitably, the theory and the examples have influenced the experiments (research led practice); this is made visible in the reflections on some of my own reading films. Thus, a number of paths and issues dealing with the word-image combination were worked out for the purpose of making reading films. Several practicable concepts emerged during the research: hybridisation and heterogenisation of the involved media, fragmentation and deconstruction, (il) legibility of text combined with moving image, layeredness and simultaneity. The dissertation addresses primarily peers: it offers artists working in the same domain a structured, detailed, descriptive map with usable insights and case studies. Ergo, A Reading Film as a research project wishes to inspire, through the dissertation and through the experiments, of which some have found their way to international festivals. Finally, there is the hope that the research, through its exploration of the media layers in reading films, may contribute to the inclusion of language and literature in the massive development of the visual culture. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|In this paper, we {{describe}} a novel technique for Document script identification(DSI) from printed documents, using Empirical Mode Decomposition (EMD). The intrinsic decomposition nature can adap-tively decompose <b>script</b> <b>images</b> {{into a series}} of modes representing different local features of <b>script</b> <b>images.</b> In this method, Radon transformed <b>script</b> <b>images</b> are decomposed into finite set of IMFs (Intrinsic Mode Functions). The energy concentration in a particu-lar orientation characterises a script texture as it indicates the domi-nance of individual script in that direction. We demonstrate how the proposed method use these IMFs as feature vectors to distinguish various scripts. Keywords: Empirical mode decomposition(EMD), Radon transform, Intrinsi...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{economic}} feasibility of maintaining large databases of document images {{has created a}} tremendous demand for robust ways to access and manipulate the information these images contain. In an automated environment, such document processing systems would clearly need human intervention to select the appropriate text understanding system for multilingual document images, which is obviously not desirable. Therefore, a script identification system is required to select the appropriate text understanding system to achieve best character interpretation among multilingual document images, automatically. In this paper, we present a survey of methods developed by researchers to identify the <b>script</b> in document <b>images</b> automatically without manual intervention.

30|$|For the 'Passenger Internet' and 'Crew Intranet' {{services}} (see Section 2.2), {{web pages}} can e.g., be compressed using classic compression algorithms such as LZW (LempelZivWelch) and Huffman encoding. However, modern implementations of web servers and browsers {{tend to do}} this themselves. Statistics [48] show {{that this is the}} case for 66 % of web pages, including embedded resources such as <b>images,</b> <b>scripts</b> and stylesheets. This means that compression by the TWCS will only be useful in {{about a third of the}} cases for web pages. When considering the increasing importance of multimedia content over traditional webpages, the importance of compression by the TWCS will decline as multimedia content is typically already compressed.|$|R
40|$|A web {{application}} is an application that uses World Wide Web’s infrastructure to deliver its {{service and a}} web browser as a client. It is accessed by users over a network such as the Internet or an intranet. Web applications are popular due to the ubiquity of web browsers and the convenience of using a web browser as a client. They have become much more complex due to the inclusion of various other scripting technologies like JavaScript, Ajax and Cascading Style Sheets etc. HTML not only describes structural semantics of a web page through markup tags, but also enables the inclusion of external resources into web documents, such as <b>images,</b> <b>scripts,</b> style sheets, media files and other objects as parts of the web page. These are called Web resources. An efficient resource monitoring method {{is necessary for the}} development of {{web application}}, because the monitoring data helps in failure detection, load balancing, scheduling strategies and performance optimization. This is in response to the growing complexity and different development practices adopted in web application development, which makes it difficult to maintain resources efficiently. In this work, a resource monitoring scheme has been proposed and implemented to monitor the web resources such as <b>images,</b> <b>scripts</b> and style sheets. The results are produced in an interactive graph based visualization. The graph shows the size, load time and frequency of access of these resources, and dependency among the links accessing a particular resource. This representation helps in decision-making process from the organization point of view. For small to medium scale web applications, the scheme can also help in some speedup...|$|R

Privacy advocates are concerned about the possible uses for these massive data troves, because anyone who knows the URLs that you visit pretty much knows what you are reading on the Web. Given a typical URL, it’s trivial to turn it into the full Web page text – just put the URL into a Web browser. There are currently no federal restrictions on the commercial acquisition and use of clickstream information in the U.

40|$|The {{digitization}} {{of video}} documentation and other production documentation (photographic <b>images,</b> <b>scripts,</b> programmes, reviews, stage designs and audio recordings) of live performances {{can be accessed}} across {{the world through the}} Internet. At the same time, protocols requisite for the effective flow of data constrain how digitized artefacts of an innately ephemeral process are "packaged" and linked for appropriate accessibility. Ironically, the digitization of such ephemera by no means guarantees their permanence as digital formats and modes of storage and retrieval are constantly vulnerable to changing industry standards and competitive commercial interests. Burvill and Seton track their experiences and reflections in pursuing the process of preparing an existing physical archive of an Australian, nationally regarded, community theatre company Sidetrack Performance Group (formerly Sidetrack Theatre Company) [URL] for digitization and archiving into a university E-Repository. This archive is linked to the AusStage database providing an accessible research facility for investigating live performances and, simultaneously, in-forming histories of theatre and performance in Australia.
