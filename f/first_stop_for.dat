5|$|The rate of {{immigration}} from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> millions seeking {{a new life in}} the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a gift from the people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.|$|E
5|$|The <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the {{expedition}} was Oslo. There it {{was greeted by}} a great ceremony at Studenterlunden {{in front of the}} University. The truck was loaded with 300kg of medicines, to the value of NOK 50,000. These medicines were to be delivered to the hospital of humanitarian Albert Schweitzer in Lambaréné, near the final destination of Libreville, the capital of Gabon. From Oslo {{the expedition}} continued to Helsingborg in Sweden and Copenhagen in Denmark, where more medicines were brought along. For public relations purposes the expedition made its way through several European citiesincluding Hamburg, Cologne, The Hague and Brusselsand was received with ceremony and much attention everywhere. In Belgium a problem arose over a missing customs declaration for the ice, but this was solved when a customs official agreed to accompany the cars through the country. Klevan later received a personal apology for this inconvenience, conveyed by the Norwegian foreign minister Halvard Lange from Lange's Belgian colleague and personal friend.|$|E
25|$|The {{boulevard}} traditionally divides Montreal by language, ethnicity, and class. Saint Laurent Boulevard was {{for generations}} the symbolic dividing {{line for the}} city, with the predominantly English-speaking population to the west, French-speaking population to the east, and immigrant communities in between along the Main and Park Avenue. The Main runs through many of Montreal's ethnic communities, a <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> immigrant communities for over 100 years— initially Jewish, Chinese and Italian, and later Portuguese, Greek, Arab, Haitian and others.|$|E

25|$|It {{was often}} the <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> many taken {{prisoner}} during engagements in the region who were later transported {{to what is now}} Canada to be exchanged, paroled or ransomed, as reported in many captivity narratives. Joseph Brant, the legendary Indian warrior who fought for the British, stopped by for a visit once, giving rise in later years to legends that he based his fearsome raids here. The fort has been informally named for him ever since even though his real involvement with it was minimal.|$|E
25|$|Though Riccarton Road {{was part}} of the route, the <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> {{outbound}} services and the last stop for inbound services were in Picton Avenue meaning there was no connection with the Riccarton tramline. This issue became moot on 1 August 1960 when a route alteration diverted Wharenui buses down Deans Avenue and Blenheim Road before rejoining the old route. There were many changes to the route over the next three decades including extensions that took it well beyond Wharenui. New destinations included Curletts Road and Springs Road and after the route ended up connecting with Hornby Mall in the 1980s it was combined with existing Templeton, Lincoln, and Southbridge routes.|$|E

25|$|During the American Civil War (1861–1865), {{the city}} was {{affected}} by its history of strong commercial ties to the South; before the war, half of its exports were related to cotton, including textiles from upstate mills. Together with its growing immigrant population, which was angry about conscription, sympathies among residents were divided for both the Union and Confederacy at the outbreak of war. Tensions related to the war culminated in the Draft Riots of 1863 by ethnic white immigrants, who attacked black neighborhood and abolitionist homes. Many blacks left the city and moved to Brooklyn. After the Civil War, the rate of immigration from Europe grew steeply, and New York became the <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> millions seeking a new and better life in the United States, a role acknowledged by {{the dedication of the}} Statue of Liberty in 1886.|$|E

A talking computer known as Hippocrates, voiced by series co-creator Trey Callaway, is shown as the primary method to monitor a patient's status.|$|E
500|$|When no stop depth or {{time limits}} are {{exceeded}} the diver must decompress more extensively than allowed {{for in the}} recommended maximum ascent rate {{to reduce the risk}} of decompression sickness. This is conventionally done as decompression stops, which are pauses in ascent at specified depths for specified times derived from the decompression algorithm and based on the dive profile history and breathing gas composition. Depth and duration of obligatory decompression stops are specified by the decompression model used. Stops are usually specified in [...] steps. The depth of the deepest (<b>first)</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> the same profile history will depend on the algorithm, as some decompression models start decompression at lower supersaturation (lower M-values) than others. The duration of the shallower stops is generally more than the duration of deeper stops on a specific dive. Stops extend the dive profile graph along the time axis.|$|E

The Southern Cross flew on to Sydney the following day (10 June).|$|R
500|$|According to {{historian}} Thierry Bianquis, [...] "Hardly anything definite {{is known}} {{about the history of the}} town [...] before the Muslim era." [...] Medieval Talmudic and Syriac writers (such as Michael the Syrian and Bar Hebraeus) identified it with the Biblical town of Rehobot han-Nahar ("Rehobot by the river [...] "). Some medieval Muslim historians, among them al-Tabari, have written that it was a place called [...] "Furda" [...] or [...] "Furdat Nu'm", named after a monastery that supposedly existed in its vicinity called [...] "Dayr Nu'm". However, the 9th-century Persian historian al-Baladhuri asserts that there was [...] "no trace that ar-Rahba... was an old city", and that it was first founded by the Abbasid general Malik ibn Tawk during the reign of Caliph al-Ma'mun (813–833 CE). As such, the fortress town was often referred to as [...] "Rahbat Malik ibn Tawk" [...] by Muslim historians. According to Syrian historian Suhayl Zakkar, al-Rahba held significant strategic value as it was [...] "the key to Syria and sometimes to Iraq" [...] and it was the <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> Syria-bound caravans coming from Iraq. From al-Rahba, travelers, caravans and armies could proceed northwestward along the Euphrates route to Aleppo or traverse the desert route to Damascus. Because of its strategic value, it was frequently fought over by rival Muslim powers. Bedouin tribes in particular used al-Rahba as a main launch point for invasions of northern Syria, and as a safe haven and marketplace. Malik ibn Tawk served as its first lord, and after his death in 873, he was succeeded by his son Ahmad. The latter was expelled following al-Rahba's capture in 883 by the Abbasid lord of al-Anbar, Muhammad ibn Abi'l-Saj. By the 10th century, al-Rahba had become a large town.|$|E
2500|$|The Creyke Road {{bus service}} served {{residential}} areas between the Fendalton and Riccarton tram routes.

[...] The <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> outbound services and the last stop for inbound services were at Christchurch Boys High School meaning there was no connection with the tram service.|$|E
2500|$|In 1839, a {{farmhouse}} located {{at what is}} now Fifth Avenue and 23rd Street {{was turned into a}} roadhouse under the direction of William [...] "Corporal" [...] Thompson (1807–1872), who later renamed it [...] "Madison Cottage", after the former president. This house was the last stop for people travelling northward out of the city, or the <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> those arriving from the north. [...] Though Madison Cottage itself was razed in 1852 or 1853 to make room first for Franconi's Roman Hippodrome and then for the Fifth Avenue Hotel, Madison Cottage ultimately gave rise to the names for the adjacent avenue (Madison Avenue) and park, which are therefore only indirectly named after President James Madison.|$|E
60|$|It was not {{surprising}} that the first who saw John had thought that he was a spirit. The news had already been received that the whole of the garrison of Jotapata had been put to the sword; and John's appearance was changed so greatly, within the last three months, that he would scarce have been known. Fatigue, anxiety, and the loss of blood--from several wounds which he had received, {{in the course of the}} siege--had so pulled him down that he was but a shadow of his former self.

2500|$|An {{agreement}} between the GWR and the Metropolitan Railway (who had co-owned the Hammersmith & City with the GWR since 1867) came into force on 1 July 1868, although it did not become legal until the following year. Under the agreement, various improvements were to be made; these included the provision of a station at Royal Oak, and the reconstruction of Westbourne Park. On 30 October 1871 the station at Royal Oak opened, [...] out; it was situated between Ranelagh Bridge and Lord Hills Bridge, and access was from the latter. As originally built, it had three platform faces; one for down trains and two, each side of an island, for up trains.

2500|$|The ship's {{location}} in Brisbane was no coincidence. Supplies and ships were {{being sent to}} the Netherlands East Indies from Brisbane as the Malay Barrier concept was still alive and the port had been the <b>first</b> <b>stop</b> <b>for</b> a number of ships diverted to Australia with the invasion of the Philippines. Significant supplies, particularly munitions, were already there or on the way from there to Java which was closest to the besieged forces in the Philippines and small, fast blockade running vessels were presumed to be readily available there. Even the prototype seaplane, the Navy's XPBS-1, had been sent to Australia and onward to Java with critical aircraft parts and a rush order of torpedo exploders from San Diego—and on departure from Pearl 30 January General Patrick Hurley with a bag of cash to add to that dispatched already for procurement locally of vital supplies. Ships of the Pensacola convoy and SS President Polk had been diverted first to Brisbane and then with supplies and munitions intended for the forces in the Philippines to Java.
