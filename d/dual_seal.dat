The pump is in unspared hydrodewaxer (HDW) feed service. The original seal design included nonpressurized <b>dual</b> <b>seals</b> {{to provide an}} additional level of reliability. However, due to the heavy-oil/high-temperature nature of the service, the <b>dual</b> <b>seals</b> produced less than desirable run times. Substantial modifications to the <b>dual</b> <b>seals</b> were made to improve their reliability, but this also proved to be disappointing. Finally, the <b>dual</b> <b>seals</b> were replaced with single seals of a different design resulting in much more favorable results. The paper provides {{a detailed description of}} both seal modifications and their results. After approximately two years of service the capacity of the pump become the unit limit. The throughput of the pump was increased by approximately 25 percent without substantial capital outlays. This performance increase was accomplished by modifying the impeller diameter, the impeller vane tip widths, and reducing the internal circulation through the use of high temperature abraidable materials and reduced internal clearances. These modifications were preceded by a rotordynamic analysis of the pump before and after the internal clearances were reduced.

This provides added protection against environmental release of the pumped product. Traditionally, many <b>dual</b> <b>seal</b> arrangements for pressurized barrier fluids consisted of two standard rotating flexible unit single seals mounted in a back to back orientation. Reliability concerns with the traditional designs include component unseating due to pressure reversal, inadequate provisions for heat removal, and collected debris causing damage to the inboard seal faces. The draft version of API 682 specifies standard pressurized barrier fluid <b>dual</b> <b>seal</b> designs (API 682 Arrangement 3) with two rotating elements and two mating rings in series (tandem arrangement). In addition, it includes design provisions for flush arrangements and component design to prevent unseating due to pressure reversals. The successful design and test validation of two <b>dual</b> <b>seal</b> series designs is described. One design is of the multiple spring type rotating flexible element (API 682 Type A), and one design uses a rotating welded metal bellows (API 682 Type B) with 0. 008 in thick heavy plate construction. Both designs were developed for use in HF acid services. Design features include multiple port injection at the primary seal, and provisions for continued seal operation under a range of pressure reversals and flashing conditions of the pumped product. The testing described includes operation on propane, isobutene, and unleaded gasoline (to simulate motor alkylate) fluids in a laboratory light hydrocarbon test loop. Test validations for specific customer requirements were run to validate {{the ability of the}} designs to perform safely under various conditions, including loss of primary seal pressure and loss of barrier fluid pressure.

40|$|Lecturepg. 77 Increasing {{environmental}} awareness {{and the ongoing}} need for improved reliability has seen {{an increase in the}} number of water reinjection installations, both onshore and offshore, and in particular in recent years, the use of double pressurized seal solutions. While these double seal solutions have presented a generally satisfactory solution, there are notable instances of problems often associated with the reliability of the supporting pressurization system. This has been particularly so in formation and produced water injection installations in the Middle East. Similarly, in offshore applications, the introduction of comingled service caused by environmental pressures on operators to reinject produced water has caused the traditional single seal solutions to become increasingly unreliable and to lose favor. Until recently, the only available solution has been the pressurized <b>dual</b> <b>seal</b> with all of the additional cost associated with a complex sealing system. However, by the application of ?active lift? technology, originally developed for gas compressors, operators are now seeing the advantage of simple nonpressurized tandem seal arrangements. With these seals, unpressurized barrier fluid is ?pumped? across the inboard seal faces into the process fluid using active lift technology, providing a clean environment within which the seal can operate. These active lift seals have now been developed and applied to a level whereby suction pressures of 70 bar/ 1000 psi and beyond can be handled, providing all of the benefits of a pressurized <b>dual</b> <b>seal,</b> without the complexity and cost of pressurized solution. While active lift technology has been applied to pumps for several years, it has traditionally been associated with low pressure environments.

A magnetic fluid secondary seal traps any vapors that leak past the primary mechanical seal.

Magnetic fluid seals have provided hermetic sealing for various gas applications over the last 20 years. One common use is as exclusion seals for magnetic disk drives. Adaptation of this technology to centrifugal pump applications required an extensive development effort. Laboratory tests show maximum emission rates of less than 3. 0 ppm of organic vapors. Field evaluations on process pumps confirm the feasibility of using this technology to achieve strict emission control. Magnetic fluid seals are nonwearing devices.

40|$|Lecturepg. 59 In this paper, an {{innovative}} approach of applying gas-lubricated, noncontacting sealing technology to process pumps is presented, {{in which a}} novel ?twin hybrid? design is incorporated to address the issues of gas seal applications to process pumps. In this design, orifice-injected inert barrier gas between concentric twin seal faces gives rise to hydrostatic action, so that the inner seal face with hydrodynamic lift features upon running can initiate and maintain stable face separation, even at extremely slow speed. The outer plain face seal, by way of higher barrier gas pressure, prevents any process fluid on the outer diameter cavity from leaking or emitting through sealing faces. The twin face design compacting two seals to one seal ring not only reduces greatly the cartridge size so as to fit all pumps without stuffing box modifications, but maintains its <b>dual</b> <b>seal</b> functionality with the single seal simplicity. The hybrid feature combining hydrostatic action for start/stop and slow speed operations, and hydrodynamic action for initiating and maintaining stable face separation not only enhances the sealing performance, but also expands its application ranges. Detailed design features and operating principles including reducing O-ring hysteresis and pressure reversal or loss-of-barrier gas are discussed. Extensive laboratory and field test were conducted to validate the designs.

40|$|TutorialMechanical seals are {{the most}} common means of sealing {{industrial}} centrifugal pumps. There are a wide variety of seal options including the use of single or <b>dual</b> <b>seal</b> arrangements. While dual seals provide benefits in leakage containment and monitoring, single seals continue to be widely used due to their lower cost and simpler designs. Newer piping plans however offer options to increase leakage detectability and containment in single seals without sacrificing the simplicity of the seal design. A Plan 65 piping plan was introduced in API 682 Third Edition and ISO 21049. This captured leakage detection practices which were currently in use in the pipeline industry. The upcoming Fourth Edition of API 682 changes the designation of this plan to Plan 65 A and adds an alternative version designated as Plan 65 B. In addition, the Fourth Edition of API 682 will introduce Plan 66 A and 66 B which provide additional alternatives for monitoring and containing seal leakage in the seal gland. The selection of piping plans in any seal application depends not only on the application conditions but also on the expectations of the end user. This includes the design of the pump and also the infrastructure to monitor equipment performance and handle process leakage. With these new options for piping plans, end users can add additional capabilities to their existing Arrangement 1 seal installations and consider single seals for future applications...|$|E

The X- 38 control surfaces require high temperature seals to limit hot gas ingestion and transfer of heat to underlying low-temperature structures to prevent over-temperature of these structures and possible loss of the vehicle. This paper presents results for thermal analyses and flow and compression tests conducted on as-received and thermally exposed seals for the rudder/fin location of the X- 38. A thermal analysis of the rudder/fin <b>dual</b> <b>seal</b> assembly based on representative heating rates on the windward surface of the rudder/fin area predicted a peak seal temperature of 1900 F. The temperature-exposed seals were heated in a compressed state at 1900 F corresponding to the predicted peak temperature. Room temperature compression tests were performed to determine load versus linear compression, preload, contact area, stiffness, and resiliency characteristics for the as-received and temperature-exposed seals. Temperature exposure resulted in permanent set and loss of resiliency in these seals. Unit loads and contact pressures for the seals were below the 5 lb/in. and 10 psi limits set to limit the loads on the Shuttle thermal tiles that the seals seal against in the rudder/fin location. Measured seal flow rates for a double seal were about 4. 5 times higher than the preliminary seal flow goal. The seal designs examined in this study are expected to be able to endure the high temperatures that they will be exposed to for a single-use life. Tests performed herein combined with future analyses, arc jet tests, and scrubbing tests will be used to select the final seal design for this application...|$|E

This pressure limit was not due to a limitation in material strength or face pattern technology as noncontacting seals have been applied in compressors at pressures well above this. The challenge came in fitting a <b>dual</b> pressurized cartridge <b>seal</b> into the limited size seal cavity available in most process pumps.

When run against a flat carbon face, laboratory tests show that the wavy seal operates in a non-contacting mode in a gas environment at pressures from zero to 600 psig. Higher gas pressures are achievable but have not been tested yet. Typical face temperature rise is two to six degrees Fahrenheit despite seal size or pressure for speeds from 200 to 3600 rpm. Gas leak rates are one fourth to one half that reported for other noncontacting seals based on grooved face technology at the same operating conditions. Tested gas environments ranged from air and nitrogen to low pressure propane. Testing was done in liquids that included high pressure liquid propane, water, synthetic oil, and crude oil. On high pressure liquid applications, the wavy face seal shows excellent containment of the product. Lab testing shows that the seal successfully contains the sudden introduction of 300 psi liquid propane. The wavy feature is bidirectional and {{is less likely to}} clog than other types of liftoff seal designs that employ some form of grooves in the face. Also, because of the smooth wavy shape, the seal can withstand contact without damage to the carbon face. In all test modes there is insignificant face wear. The wavy seal is employed as a safety backup to primary seals operating in flashing or nonflashing hydrocarbons. The wavy secondary seal should have a longer life than the primary seal and will prevent excessive leakage to the environment if the primary seal fails. The wavy seal can also be employed as a primary seal in low pressure blowers and as a <b>dual</b> <b>seal</b> with nitrogen or air barrier fluid at a higher pressure than the process.

Testing included operation with a light hydrocarbon in both the liquid and vapor phases. Incorporating an interstage and external labyrinth with an inert gas sweep satisfied low environmental emissions requirements. A purge and vent control panel system was developed to monitor and establish appropriate gas purge and vent settings for containment and emissions purposes. Installation at the plant included a close clearance throat bushing and removal of the seal flush to encourage vapor accumulation in the seal chamber. The first seal was installed in the plant on January 1, 1997, and has operated through November 1998 without problems.

The alternative to this pump was a reciprocating compressor, which had been used on previous process units. Compared with the pump compressor option would have been significantly more expensive to purchase and would have resulted in increased maintenance over the life of the process unit. The pump selected was a nine-stage barrel pump rotating at 6686 rpm driven by an electric motor through a gearbox. The fluid being pumped was ethylene. Suction pressure was 950 psig. The ethylene was chilled to an operating temperature of 50 F so that the pump could develop the head necessary to produce the required discharge pressure of 4450 psig. The seals selected have now run for over two years with no failures. This includes several issues with the pump during which the pump was disassembled to correct vibration problems. At these times, the seals were removed from the pump and were not even reconditioned but were just reinstalled. Under similar conditions, a contacting seal would have been reconditioned each time the seals were removed and would have had an ultimate life expectancy of only six months...|$|R
50|$|The α700 {{had a lower}} pixel {{resolution}} {{than the}} later α350 (12.4 vs. 14.2), and the α350 included additional features (Live preview mode, automatic pop-up flash) at a lower price. However, the α700 used a pentaprism viewfinder instead of a pentamirror, had a higher burst speed (5 frames per second vs 2.5), had a higher resolution LCD screen, magnesium alloy body, twin control dials, better environmental <b>seals,</b> <b>dual</b> flash media slots (CF and MS-DUO), a PC Sync socket, more autofocus points, a stronger autofocus motor, and HDMI output. The α350's sensor was also a CCD sensor, {{as opposed to the}} α700's Exmor CMOS sensor which granted the α700 superior low-light performance.|$|R
