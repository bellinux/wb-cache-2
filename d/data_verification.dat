This paper proposes an optimized variant of CRC (Checker Redundancy Cyclic) verification algorithm based on HDFS to improve the efficiency of <b>data</b> integrity <b>verification</b> in cloud storage through the research of CRC checksum algorithm and <b>data</b> integrity <b>verification</b> mechanism of HDFS. A new method is formulated to establish the deformational optimization and to accelerate the algorithm by researching characteristics of generating and checking the algorithm.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedA data assimilation technique for incorporating relatively sparse ocean thermal structure profiles into the Garwood (1977) Oceanic Planetary Boundary Layer (OPBL) model is proposed. A {{summary of the}} data assimilation tests by Elsberry and Warrenfeltz (EW) is presented. The complete and perfect model generated <b>verification</b> <b>data</b> from the EW study were used to simulate incomplete and noisy data {{as might be expected}} in real <b>data</b> <b>verifications.</b> Random errors that are normally distributed about the mean mixed layer depth (MLD) and temperature (MLT), are added to subsets of the EW <b>verification</b> <b>data</b> during the summer and winter regimes. From these simulated tests, it was concluded that a data assimilation technique with a 1 -D OPBL model can improve predictions of the ocean thermal structure even with incomplete and noisy <b>verification</b> <b>data.</b> Real bathythermographic temperature profiles from Ocean Weather Station PAPA are then inserted into the Garwood model to verify the EW data assimilation studies. The tests with real data demonstrate the necessity of defining the MLD in an observed profile that is consistent with the model output MLD. In addition, biases were observed that originated from the use of an imperfect model. After the elimination of the biases and the MLD descrepancies, it is suggested that a 1 -D model used for data assimilation can improve predictions of the ocean thermal structure.

Aiming {{at current}} problem of high {{computing}} overhead of encryption and authentication, this paper proposes a confidentiality and integrity protection method {{based on one}} time encryption. The method packages <b>data</b> block and <b>verification</b> <b>data</b> together, and then encrypts it. The confidentiality is guaranteed by traditional encryption mode and the integrity is guaranteed by decrypted <b>verification</b> <b>data.</b> Analysis and simulation show that the method has less time and space overhead than standard encryption and authentication mode. The method {{can be applied to}} other integrity and confidentiality protection schemes, and can meet the performance requirements of the most applications...|$|R
50|$|To {{reduce the}} burden of site {{monitoring}} on clinical trials, the FDA now recommends a risk-based monitoring (RBM) approach. The essence of this recommendation is to gather meaningful metrics that ascertain the safety and welfare of the subjects and performance of the clinical trial, rather than doing 100% source <b>data</b> <b>verification.</b> Adopting RBM may reduce site monitoring costs by 25%. thus reducing overall cost and risk on clinical trials.|$|E
50|$|CRCs are {{so called}} because the check (<b>data</b> <b>verification)</b> value is a {{redundancy}} (it expands the message without adding information) and the algorithm {{is based on}} cyclic codes. CRCs are popular because they are simple to implement in binary hardware, easy to analyze mathematically, and particularly good at detecting common errors caused by noise in transmission channels. Because the check value has a fixed length, the function that generates it is occasionally used as a hash function.|$|E

Michael Nahas and Peter Clements took up these ideas in July 2002, with additional input from Paul Nettle and Ryan Gallagher (who both wrote Par1 clients). Version 2.0 of the Parchive specification was published by Michael Nahas in September 2002.|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{establishment}} of trust relationships to a trusted platform {{relies on the}} process of validation. Validation allows an external entity to build trust in the expected behaviour of the platform based on provided evidence of the platform’s configu-ration. In a validation mechanism such as remote attestation, the trusted platform exhibits <b>verification</b> <b>data</b> created during a start up process. These data consist in hardware-protected values of platform configuration registers, containing nested measurement values, i. e., hash values, of all loaded or started components. The values are created in linear order by the secured extend operation. Fine-grained diagnosis of components by the validator, based on the linear order of <b>verification</b> <b>data</b> and associated measurement logs, is inefficient. We propose a method to create a tree-formed <b>verification</b> <b>data,</b> in which component measurement values represent leaves and protected registers represent roots. It is shown how this is possible using a limited number of hardware-protected registers and the standard extend operation. In this way, the security of <b>verification</b> <b>data</b> is maintained, while the stored measurement log is consistently organised as a tree. We exhibit the basic mechanism of validating a platform using tree-formed measurement logs and <b>verification</b> <b>data.</b> I...|$|R
