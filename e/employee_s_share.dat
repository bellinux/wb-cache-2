40|$|Since {{at least}} the 1970 <b>s,</b> <b>employee</b> <b>share</b> {{ownership}} has enjoyed bipartisan support in Australia. Despite broad and sustained public policy interest in employee share ownership, Australian literature on the subject remains scarce. There has also been {{very little in the}} way of comprehensive analysis of the regulatory framework. This paper provides an overview of employee share ownership from an Australian perspective. It begins by reviewing the literature on broad-based employee share ownership before turning to examine available data on Australian practice. It then considers how employee share ownership plans are currently provided for in public policy and law. Companies in Australia proposing to offer securities to employees must comply with a myriad of regulatory requirements. This paper examines these requirements. It also examines features of the current regulatory framework which have been identified as problematic...|$|R

This research focused {{on the influence of}} leadership, organisational values and organisational change on employee engagement within a volatile, uncertain, complex and ambiguous (VUCA) environment. The construct leadership was further examined using two hierarchical levels, <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line manager and <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders to deepen the understanding of the influence these levels of leadership have on employee engagement A quantitative research approach was followed wherein a non-random convenience sample (N = 969) of permanent staff operating within the Retail Operations Specialities function of South Africa s largest non-food retailer participated in the study. Regression analysis was conducted to determine the strength {{of the relationship between the}} dependent (employee engagement) and independent variables for each research question. An analysis of variance (ANOVA) test was conducted to analyse the differences among group means and their associated procedures. <b>Employee</b> <b>s</b> senior leaders were found to have a stronger influence on <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> engagement levels in comparison to <b>employee</b> <b>s</b> line managers. In addition the study found that the application of organisational values have a positive influence on employee engagement whilst organisational change was found to have the strongest influence on employee engagement explaining 41. 2 % of the variance in employee engagement.

The purpose of this paper is to determine the impact of unions on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income in the U. S. This study adds to the understanding of this topic by developing an analytical model of imperfect competition and estimating the model using panel data for the manufacturing sector. This study finds that unions have a positive impact on labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. Specifically, this paper finds that labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> declined 17. 9 percent between 1997 and 2006 whereas, if unionization density had remained at its 1997 level, labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> would have declined only 13. 9 percent. Thus, the decline in unionization explains about 29 percent of the decline in labor 2 ̆ 7 <b>s</b> <b>share</b> of income. This paper is important for three reasons. First, this paper sheds light on whether social and institutional forces play an important role in determining the distribution of income between labor and capital.
