5|$|Cooper {{also found}} {{work in a}} variety of non-Western films, appearing, for example, as a masked Cossack in The Eagle (1925), as a Roman guard in Ben-Hur (1925), and as a flood {{survivor}} in The Johnstown Flood (1926). Gradually, <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> land credited roles that offered him more screen time, in films such as Tricks (1925), in which he played the film's antagonist, and the short film Lightnin' Wins (1926). As a featured player, <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> attract the attention of major film studios.

5|$|From {{around this}} time onwards, while Etty still held to his belief {{that the purpose of}} art is to {{illustrate}} moral lessons, <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> abandon the literary, religious and mythological themes which had dominated his work. <b>He</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> paint still lifes, beginning with Pheasant and Peach (likely to be the painting now called Dead Pheasant and Fruit); in the 1840s he exhibited six in total, and painted many more. Etty was the first English painter to paint significant still lifes, which at the time were thought by the English a primarily Netherlandish form. Also for the first time, <b>he</b> <b>began</b> <b>to</b> paint a significant number of landscape paintings. Etty still continued to paint history paintings, but while he continued to produce highly acclaimed reworkings of his previous pictures, those works on fresh topics were generally poorly received. Etty's decline in quality can possibly be attributed in part to London art dealers; from 1835 dealer Richard Colls had become increasingly close to Etty, and by 1844 had a near-monopoly on his work. As the importance of the landed gentry to the art market declined, the new purchasers of art were industrialists; generally lacking in a classical education and with little interest in Old Masters, they preferred to buy works by then-contemporary artists such as Etty, and relied on dealers to advise them.|$|E
