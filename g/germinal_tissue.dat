40|$|The {{reproductive}} {{effort in}} terms of fecundity and energy allocation was studied in two species of semelparous polychaetes belonging to the genus Perinereis, {{living in the same}} environment, with different reproductive modalities. There is a great individual variability both {{in terms of}} reproductive effort and fecundity. Fecundity varied from 4080 to 15000 oocytes in P. rullieri and from 7000 to 26000 in P. cultrifera; no linear relationship was found between oocyte number and total jaw length utilised as size index. The energy content of <b>germinal</b> and somatic <b>tissues</b> was determined by Differential Scanning Calorimeter (DSC). The reproductive effort was calculated as RE = E-G/(E-G + E-S) where E-G is the total energy in <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues</b> and E-S is the total energy in somatic tissues. Reproductive effort is very high with mean values of 0. 62 for P. rullieri and 0. 79 for P. cultrifera. The different amounts of energy allocated in <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues</b> {{can be attributed to the}} different reproductive modalities-P. rullieri reproduces in the atokous phase whereas P. cultrifera has conserved epitoky in its life-cycle. The lack of correlation between reproductive effort and size index strongly suggests that reproductive allocation does not increase with age. In semelparous species the variability in fecundity and reproductive effort observed cannot be interpreted in terms of a trade-off between fecundity and survival as in iteroparous species. In fact, in semelparous an individual allocates all available resources to reproduction and then dies...|$|R

40|$|Here we {{show that}} RNA {{interference}} (RNAi) machinery operates in Drosophila melanogaster 1. 688 satellite transcription.

50|$|The {{mammalian}} male {{reproductive system}} contains two main divisions, the penis and the testicles, {{the latter of}} which is where sperm are produced. In humans, both of these organs are outside the abdominal cavity, {{but they can be}} primarily housed within the abdomen in other animals. For instance, a dog's penis is covered by a penile sheath except when mating. Having the testicles outside the abdomen best facilitates temperature regulation of the sperm, which require specific temperatures to survive. The external location may also cause a reduction in the heat-induced contribution to the spontaneous mutation rate in male <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue.</b> Sperm are the smaller of the two gametes and are generally very short-lived, requiring males to produce them continuously from the time of sexual maturity until death. The produced sperm are stored in the epididymis until ejaculation. The sperm cells are motile and they swim using tail-like flagella to propel themselves towards the ovum. The sperm follows temperature gradients (thermotaxis) and chemical gradients (chemotaxis) to locate the ovum.|$|E
40|$|Mutation in {{the gene}} merry-go-round (mgr) of Drosophila causes {{a variety of}} {{phenotypic}} traits in somatic and <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues,</b> such as polyploid cells, metaphasic arrest, postmeiotic cysts with 16 nuclei, and spermatids with four times the normal chromosome content. The most characteristic phenotype is the appearance of mitotic and meiotic figures where all chromosomes are arranged in a circle. Treatment with anti-mitotic drugs and the phenotype of double mutants mgr asp (asp being a mutation altering the spindle) show that these circular figures need a functional spindle for their formation. These abnormal figures are caused by monopolar spindles similar to those observed after different treatments in several organisms. All mutant traits indicate that mgr performs a function necessary for the correct behaviour of centrosomes, thus opening this organelle to genetic analysis...|$|R
50|$|The male {{reproductive}} system contains two main divisions: the testes where sperm are produced, and the penis. In humans, {{both of these}} organs are outside the abdominal cavity. Having the testes outside the abdomen facilitates temperature regulation of the sperm, which require specific temperatures to survive about 2-3 °C less than the normal body temperature i.e. 37 °C. In particular, the extraperitoneal location of the testes {{may result in a}} 2-fold reduction in the heat-induced contribution to the spontaneous mutation rate in male <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues</b> compared to tissues at 37 °C. If the testicles remain too close to the body, {{it is likely that the}} increase in temperature will harm the spermatozoa formation, making conception more difficult. This is why the testes are carried in an external pouch viz. scrotum rather than within the abdomen; they normally remain slightly cooler than body temperature, facilitating sperm production.|$|R
40|$|We report {{here the}} use of the maize transposable element Activator (Ac) to isolate a dicot gene. Ac was {{introduced}} into petunia, where it transposed into Ph 6, one of several genes that modify anthocyanin pigmentation in flowers by affecting the pH of the corolla. Like other Ac-mutable alleles, the new mutation is unstable and reverts to a functional form in somatic and <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues.</b> The mutant gene was cloned using Ac as a probe, demonstrating the feasibility of heterologous transposon tagging in higher plants. Confirmation that the cloned DNA fragment corresponded to the mutated gene was obtained from an analysis of revertants. In every case examined, reversion to the wild-type phenotype was correlated with restoration of a wild-type-sized DNA fragment. New transposed Acs were detected in many of the revertants. As in maize, the frequency of somatic and germinal excision of Ac from the mutable allele appears to be dependent on genetic background...|$|R
40|$|Histogenesis of the metacestode of Echinococcus vogeli was traced {{mainly in}} rodents inoculated intraperitoneally with finely minced infective vesicles. The {{fragments}} aggregated in the peritoneal cavity and coalesced, forming structures (plaques) from which primary vesicles arose. From primordia in their <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue,</b> exogenous vesicles developed, enlarged, and migrated outward {{to the surface}} of the laminated membrane, where they remained attached and proliferated. Each unit of vesicles so formed retained discrete identity and, within 6 - 8 months, acquired an adventitia; thereafter, exogenous multiplication ceased and endogenous proliferation supervened. Large numbers of daughter cysts arose in the <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue</b> lining chambers within the units; endogenous proliferation also finally ceased, and the daughter cysts produced brood capsules containing protoscoleces. Primordia of exogenous vesicles were not observed in the walls of daughter cysts. Production of protoscoleces involved three processes: they developed in typical brood capsules, singly in minute brood capsules, or directly from <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue.</b> Exogenous proliferation is not characteristic in the natural intermediate host of E. vogeli, the paca.

40|$|Summary. The authors analyse some of {{the results}} of {{examination}} of 607 sterile patients, in which probatory excision from the testicles had been performed. They have reached the following conclusions. Testicular biopsy is a decisive diagnostic method {{in the case of a}} repeated finding of azoospermia. In these cases, the following three conditions must be satisfied before probatory excision is carried out: (1) The spermatic fluid must contain vesicular secretions. (2) The long axis of the testes must be longer than 30 mm. (3) The patient must not have suffered from epididymitis of tuber¬ culous origin. In the cases of obstructive azoospermia, the authors recommend a careful evaluation of the <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue</b> before an eventual vaso-epididymal anastomosis. In cases of repeated findings of oligozoospermia gravis, they do not examine the germinal epithelium as in a majority of ninety-eight patients with this finding the state of <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue</b> was markedly deficient and not suitable for treatment. From the therapeutic point of view, the authors exclude by means of testicular biopsy from long-term and expensive treatment those cases in which the histopathological picture in the testes does not justify any hope of a favourable result of therapy...|$|E

40|$|International audienceIn adults, {{stem cells}} are {{responsible}} for the maintenance of many actively renewing tissues, such as haematopoietic, skin, gut and <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues.</b> These stem cells can self-renew or be committed to becoming progenitors. Stem-cell commitment is thought to be irreversible but in male and female Drosophila melanogaster, it was shown recently that differentiating germ cells can revert to functional stem cells that can restore germinal lineage. Whether progenitors are also able to generate stem cells in mammals remains unknown. Here we show that purified mouse spermatogonial progenitors committed to differentiation can generate functional germinal stem cells that can repopulate germ-cell-depleted testes when transplanted into adult mice. We found that GDNF, a key regulator of the stem-cell niche, and FGF 2 are able to reprogram in vitro spermatogonial progenitors for reverse differentiation. This study supports the emerging concept that the stem-cell identity is not restricted in adults to a definite pool of cells that self-renew, but that stemness could be acquired by differentiating progenitors after tissue injury and throughout life...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe study {{aimed to}} clarify the role of {{apoptosis}} in pentachlorophenol (PCP) induced testicular, ovarian and renal cell genotoxicity of Heteropneustes fossilis. It was further intended to find the target germ cell type and assess the cellular and nuclear damage. Treatment of PCP was used for multiduration on the <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues</b> and they were processed to detect structural changes by light and electron microscopic evaluation and kidney cells for subsequent detection of DNA fragmentation by agarose gel electrophoresis. Findings suggest functional and morphological changes in the tissues are due to apoptosis, as evidenced by some biochemical and cytological signs. Histological observation on germinal epithelium reveals cell suicidal symptoms such as vacuolization, liquefied regions in the cytoplasm of oocytes, margination of nuclei, clumping of chromatin, and compaction of cytoplasmic organelle. Biochemical manifestation concurrent to this, is; cleavage of kidney cell DNA into low molecular weight fragments confirming apoptosis. Subsequently, it is further cleaved into nucleosome size fragments or its multiples. Ultra-structural histopathology and DNA studies conclusively lead to the PCP induced apoptosis in the exposed cell types. Results further support the usefulness of this assay in the related studies and its feasibility in generating a base line data...|$|R

In the studies {{described}} here, we used these hybrids to produce 18 transgenic mouse lines, each carrying a single newly acquired Srev locus (SWR/J-RF/J ecotropic proviral locus). All {{of the newly}} acquired proviruses identified in mosaic founder SWR/J-RF/J mice that could be transmitted through the germ line were also present in somatic tissues, demonstrating that viral integration occurred before the germ line was set aside from the somatic lineages. Quantitative analysis of proviral DNA copy numbers in somatic and <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues</b> of mosaic founder parents combined with structural analysis of Srev loci indicated that these proviruses are acquired after multiple rounds of somatic viral reinfection and {{that most of these}} viral integration events occurred after DNA replication in the zygote and before DNA replication in the four-cell embryo. The frequency of provirus acquisition in Srev lines that expressed the infectious ecotropic virus was similar to that in SWR.

40|$|Among sturgeons, the {{occurrence}} of individuals with gonads containing both testis and ovary components is considered pathological, and such fish are described as intersex individuals or intersexes. Intersexes are observed in both wild and cultured populations of sturgeon, usually at low frequencies. In the present study, intersex Russian (Acipenser gueldenstaedtii) and Siberian (Acipenser baerii) sturgeons constituted 30 % of the studied populations. Macroscopically, intersex gonads were recognizable from 500 days posthatching (dph). Initially, gonads with predominantly male characteristics (testis-ova) were observed, but in older fish gonads with predominantly female traits (ova-testis) were more frequent. Using microscopic analysis, intersex gonads were discernible by 130 – 200 dph. Observations of intersex germinal epithelium development and analysis of sex distribution in the study populations indicated that feminization was occurring. Histological analysis revealed that differentiation of the germinal epithelium in such gonads was accompanied by various morphological alterations (trans-formations) that were described using quantitative and locali-zation criteria. The {{most common type of}} transformations, massive subepithelial transformations, was manifested by the presence of abundant female <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue</b> located under the gonad surface epithelium in the developing testis.

Eight left ovaries removed from three fetuses (developmental age 20 - 25 weeks), four neonates, and one 8 -month-old child all with a 46,XX karyotype, free from malformations of the genital apparatus, were completely cut obtaining serial sections and one 1 mum-thick section every 1, 000 mum was examined. Ovarian volume was 30 mm 3 at the 20 th week of development, 36 mm 3 at the 25 th week, 129 mm 3 at birth, and 287 mm 3 at the eighth postnatal month. The primitive cortical tissue was the largest component of the fetal ovaries (17 mm 3, corresponding to 60. 2 % of the organ). The second component was the interstitium (21 % of the organ), followed by the medulla (11. 8 % of the organ). The primordial follicles occupied {{a small part of}} the organs: 1. 8 mm 3 at 20 weeks and 3. 4 mm 3 at 25 weeks (respectively 6. 7 % and 5. 4 % of the volumes of the relevant ovaries).

40|$|International audienceIntercellular bridges called "ring canals" (RCs) {{resulting}} from incomplete cytokinesis play {{an essential role}} in intercellular communication in somatic and <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues.</b> During Drosophila oogenesis, RCs connect the maturing oocyte to nurse cells supporting its growth. Despite numerous genetic screens aimed at identifying genes involved in RC biogenesis and maturation, how RCs anchor to the plasma membrane (PM) throughout development remains unexplained. In this study, we report that the clathrin adaptor protein 1 (AP- 1) complex, although dispensable for the biogenesis of RCs, is required for the maintenance of the anchorage of RCs to the PM to withstand the increased membrane tension associated with the exponential tissue growth at the onset of vitellogenesis. Here we unravel the mechanisms by which AP- 1 enables the maintenance of RCs' anchoring to the PM during size expansion. We show that AP- 1 regulates the localization of the intercellular adhesion molecule E-cadherin and that loss of AP- 1 causes the disappearance of the E-cadherin-containing adhesive clusters surrounding the RCs. E-cadherin itself is shown to be required for the maintenance of the RCs' anchorage, a function previously unrecognized because of functional compensation by N-cadherin. Scanning block-face EM combined with transmission EM analyses reveals the presence of interdigitated, actin- and Moesin-positive, microvilli-like structures wrapping the RCs. Thus, by modulating E-cadherin trafficking, we show that the sustained E-cadherin-dependent adhesion organizes the microvilli meshwork and ensures the proper attachment of RCs to the PM, thereby counteracting the increasing membrane tension induced by exponential tissue growth...|$|R
40|$|The maize {{transposon}} Ac/Ds transposes by a “cut {{and paste}} 2 ̆ 2 ” mechanism, leaving a site-specific DSB at the Ds locus for repair. Previous studies in maize and Arabidopsis showed that Ac/Ds excision can stimulate homologous recombination between tandem duplicated repeats and between ectopic homologies. In this study, {{we tested the}} efficacy of such Ac/Ds excision-induced homologous recombination to achieve gene targeting in Arabidopsis. A defective visual-selective dual marker harboring Ds element is transformed into Arabidopsis as target locus, and donor homology is provided by Agrobacterium-mediated T-DNA by floral dipping. The DSB inducer Ac is either first crossed into target lines or co-transformed with donor T-DNA, and several independent germinal recombinants have been recovered from both strategies with gene targeting frequency of 0. 3 - 2. 0 X 10 (- 3). We also attempted gene targeting by ectopic recombination, with donor homology provided by the concomitant integrated T-DNA copies in genome. With this approach the gene targeting frequency turns out less than 6. 7 X 10 (- 6). Our results suggest that Ac/Ds transposon-induced homologous recombination may provide an alternative gene targeting strategy. The implications of these results for plant gene targeting are discussed. Multiple pathways are used to repair Double Strand Breaks (DSBs), including Nonhomologous End Joining (NHEJ) and Homologous Recombination (HR) which can take Single Strand Annealing (SSA) or Gene Conversion (GC) pathway. DSB repair in plants has been extensively studied using site-specific DSB agents, including two mechanistically different inducers transposon Ac/Ds and endonuclease I-SceI. A direct comparison between Ac/Ds and I-SceI in DSB repair, however, is lacking due to the diversity of systems used among previous studies. In addition, only a few DSB repair studies addressed germinal recombination frequencies. In this study, we developed three constructs (HRS 1, 2 and 3) that allow comparison of multiple pathways for repair of DSBs induced by Ac/Ds excision and by I-SceI cutting at the same chromosomal loci. The results show that differential pathway utilization exists between the repair of Ac/Ds excision and I-SceI induced DSBs: (i) In somatic tissues, Ac/Ds induced HR preferentially utilizes SSA and/or represses GC 4 fold higher than I-SceI; (ii) In <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues,</b> repair of Ac/Ds induced DSBs favors NHEJ and strongly represses HR by 2 to 3 orders magnitude, whereas I-SceI-induced DSBs are repaired equally by NHEJ and HR; (iii) Furthermore, Ac/Ds induced germinal HR preferentially utilizes SSA and/or represses GC 5 fold higher than I-SceI; and (iv) <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues</b> preferentially utilize SSA 3 fold higher than GC compared to somatic tissues for both Ac/Ds and I-SceI induced HR. Despite these inequalities, a roughly positive correlation exists between somatic and germinal HR frequencies for both Ac/Ds and I-SceI-induced DSBs. Overall, DSB repair pathway and frequency is strongly affected by both cell type (somatic vs. germinal) and DSB agent. The striking difference of repair pathway utilization between Ac/Ds and I-SceI suggests specific role(s) of Ac/Ds in DSB repair. The hairpin intermediate generated prior to DSB formation, or Ac transposase per se, may promote NHEJ and SSA and/or repress GC. These results provide new insight into how transposons affect genome structure and also {{shed light on the}} biology of DSB-induced HR that may facilitate the development of genome modification tools for plants...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} {{pituitary gland}} originates from two separate <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues</b> during embryonic development. The anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary {{are derived from}} Rathke's pouch, a pocket formed by an invagination of the oral ectoderm. The posterior lobe {{is derived from the}} infundibulum, which is formed by evagination of the neuroectoderm in the ventral diencephalon. Previous studies have shown that development of Rathke's pouch and the generation of distinct populations of hormone-producing endocrine cell lineages in the anterior/intermediate pituitary lobes is regulated by a number of transcription factors expressed in the pouch and by inductive signals from the ventral diencephalon/infundibulum. However, little is known about factors that regulate the development of the posterior pituitary lobe. In this study, we show that the LIM-homeobox gene Lhx 2 is extensively expressed in the developing ventral diencephalon, including the infundibulum and the posterior lobe of the pituitary. Deletion of Lhx 2 gene results in persistent cell proliferation, a complete failure of evagination of the neuroectoderm in the ventral diencephalon, and defects {{in the formation of the}} distinct morphological features of the infundibulum and the posterior pituitary lobe. Rathke's pouch is formed and endocrine cell lineages are generated in the anterior/intermediate pituitary lobes of the Lhx 2 mutant. However, the shape and organization of the pouch and the anterior/intermediate pituitary lobes are severely altered due to the defects in development of the infundibulum and the posterior lobe. Our study thus reveals an essential role for Lhx 2 in the regulation of posterior pituitary development and suggests a mechanism whereby development of the posterior lobe may affect the development of the anterior and intermediate lobes of the pituitary gland...|$|R

40|$|Background: The mycobacteriophage large serine {{recombinase}} Bxb 1 catalyzes {{site-specific recombination}} between its corresponding attP and attB recognition sites. Previously, we {{and others have}} shown that Bxb 1 has catalytic activity in various eukaryotic species including Nicotiana tabacum, Schizosaccharomyces pombe, insects and mammalian cells. Results: In this work, the Bxb 1 recombinase gene was transformed and constitutively expressed in Arabidopsis thaliana plants harboring a chromosomally integrated attP and attB-flanked target sequence. The Bxb 1 recombinase successfully excised the target sequence in a conservative manner and the resulting recombination event was heritably transmitted to subsequent generations {{in the absence of}} the recombinase transgene. In addition, we also show that Bxb 1 recombinase expressing plants can be manually crossed with att-flanked target transgenic plants to generate excised progeny. Conclusion: The Bxb 1 large serine recombinase performs site-specific recombination in Arabidopsis thaliana <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue,</b> producing stable lines free of unwanted DNA. The precise site-specific deletion produced by Bxb 1 in planta demonstrates that this enzyme can be a useful tool for the genetic engineering of plants without selectable marker transgenes or other undesirable exogenous sequences...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Sox 9 and Oct 4 are two {{important}} regulatory factors involved in mammalian development. Sox 9, {{a member of}} the group E Sox transcription factor family, has {{a crucial role in the}} development of the genitourinary system, while Oct 4, commonly known as octamer binding transcription factor 4, belongs to class V of the transcription family. The expression of these two proteins exhibits a dynamic pattern with regard to their expression sites and levels. The aim of this study was to investigate the role of de novo methylation in the regulation of the tissue- and site-specific expression of these proteins. The dynamics of the de novo methylation of 15 CpGs and six CpGs in Sox 9 and Oct 4 respectively, was studied with sodium bisulfite genomic DNA sequencing in mouse testis at different developmental stages. Consistent methylation of three CpGs was observed in adult ovary in which the expression of Sox 9 was feeble, while the level of methylation in somatic tissue was greater in Oct 4 compared to <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue.</b> The promoter-chromatin status of Sox 9 was also studied with a chromatin immune-precipitation assay...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The large serine {{recombinase}} phiC 31 from broad {{host range}} Streptomyces temperate phage, catalyzes the site-specific recombination of two recognition sites that differ in sequence, typically known as attachment sites attB and attP. Previously, we characterized the phiC 31 catalytic activity {{and modes of}} action in the fission yeast Schizosaccharomyces pombe. Results In this work, the phiC 31 recombinase gene was placed {{under the control of}} the Arabidopsis OXS 3 promoter and introduced into Arabidopsis harboring a chromosomally integrated attB and attP -flanked target sequence. The phiC 31 recombinase excised the attB and attP -flanked DNA, and the excision event was detected in subsequent generations in the absence of the phiC 31 gene, indicating germinal transmission was possible. We further verified that the genomic excision was conservative and that introduction of a functional recombinase can be achieved through secondary transformation as well as manual crossing. Conclusion The phiC 31 system performs site-specific recombination in <b>germinal</b> <b>tissue,</b> a prerequisite for generating stable lines with unwanted DNA removed. The precise site-specific deletion by phiC 31 in planta demonstrates that the recombinase can be used to remove selectable markers or other introduced transgenes that are no longer desired and therefore can be a useful tool for genome engineering in plants. </p...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe {{mammalian}} urogenital system {{derives from}} multipotent progenitor cells of different <b>germinal</b> <b>tissues.</b> The contribution of individual sub-populations to specific {{components of the}} mature system, and the spatiotemporal restriction of the respective lineages have remained poorly characterized. Here, we use comparative expression analysis to delineate sub-regions within the developing urogenital system that express the T-box transcription factor gene Tbx 18. We show that Tbx 18 is transiently expressed in the epithelial lining and the subjacent mesenchyme of the urogenital ridge. At the onset of metanephric development Tbx 18 expression occurs in a band of mesenchyme in between the metanephros and the Wolffian duct but is subsequently restricted to the mesenchyme surrounding the distal ureter stalk. Genetic lineage tracing reveals that former Tbx 18 + cells of the urogenital ridge and the metanephric field contribute substantially to the adrenal glands and gonads, to the kidney stroma, the ureteric and the bladder mesenchyme. Loss of Tbx 18 does not affect differentiation of the adrenal gland, the gonad, the bladder and the kidney. However, ureter differentiation is severely disturbed as the mesenchymal lineage adopts a stromal rather than a ureteric smooth muscle fate. DiI labeling and tissue recombination experiments show that the restriction of Tbx 18 expression to the prospective ureteric mesenchyme does not reflect an active condensation process but {{is due to a}} specific loss of Tbx 18 expression in the mesenchyme out of range of signals from the ureteric epithelium. These cells either contribute to the renal stroma or undergo apoptosis aiding in severing the ureter from its surrounding tissues. We show that Tbx 18 -deficient cells do not respond to epithelial signals suggesting that Tbx 18 is required to prepattern the ureteric mesenchyme. Our study provides new insights into the molecular diversity of urogenital progenitor cells and helps to understand the specification of the ureteric mesenchymal sub-lineage...|$|R
