5|$|A second war in Bernicia, {{probably}} in 1018, was more successful. The Battle of Carham, by the River Tweed, {{was a victory}} for the Scots led by Malcolm II and the men of Strathclyde led by their king, Owen the Bald. By this time Earl Uchtred may <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead,</b> and Eiríkr Hákonarson was appointed Earl of Northumbria by his brother-in-law Cnut the Great, although his authority seems to have been limited to the south, the former kingdom of Deira, and he took no action against the Scots so far as is known. The work De obsessione Dunelmi (The siege of Durham, associated with Symeon of Durham) claims that Uchtred's brother Eadwulf Cudel surrendered Lothian to Malcolm II, presumably {{in the aftermath of the}} defeat at Carham. This is likely to have been the lands between Dunbar and the Tweed as other parts of Lothian had been under Scots control before this time. It has been suggested that Cnut received tribute from the Scots for Lothian, but as he had likely received none from the Bernician Earls this is not very probable.|$|E
5|$|Although it {{is clear}} that Siward was earl by 1033, he may have {{attained}} the position somewhat earlier. His predecessor Erik of Hlathir last appeared in the historical sources in 1023, leaving a ten-year gap during which Siward could have taken the position. Although William of Malmesbury asserted that Erik was driven back to Scandinavia, Scandinavian tradition firmly maintained he died in England. Historian William Kapelle believed that Erik ceased to be earl in or soon after 1023, and that Carl son of Thurbrand was appointed hold or high-reeve (heahgerefa) for the king in Yorkshire. Carl retained this position, it was argued, even after Siward was installed as earl a few years later, but from then on he acted as a deputy to the earl rather than to the king. Richard Fletcher remained agnostic on the point, although he did argue that Erik must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> by 1028. Timothy Bolton, although rejecting Kapelle's argument concerning Carl son of Thurbrand, believed Erik died c. 1023 and that the earldom may have remained vacant for a period. Bolton argued that Cnut left the earldom of Northumbria empty and appears to have paid it little attention until the last years of his reign, and another northerner Ealdred son of Uhtred rose to power in the political vacuum.|$|E

25|$|Sebastian later {{stood by}} a {{staircase}} where the emperor was to pass and harangued Diocletian for his cruelties against Christians. This freedom of speech, {{and from a}} person whom he supposed to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead,</b> greatly astonished the emperor; but, recovering from his surprise, he gave orders for his being seized and beat to death with cudgels, and his body thrown into the common sewer.

25|$|To be {{eligible}} for nomination, a person {{must have been a}} native born or naturalized (since 1914) citizen of the United States, must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for 25 years (since 1922; from 1900 through 1920, a nominee had to be dead only 10 years) and must have made a major contribution to the economic, political, or cultural life of the nation. Nominees were elected by a simple majority vote, except from 1925 through 1940, when a 3/5 majority was required. In 1976 a point system replaced the majority vote. Two nominees, Constance Woolson (nominated in 1900) and Orville Wright (elected in 1965), were considered, although being dead only 6 and 17 years respectively.|$|E
25|$|Burley made a {{nuncupative will}} in October 1415, which {{suggests}} {{that he was very}} ill by this time, although he declared that his mind and memory were still intact. The contents were not greatly illuminating. After commending his soul to his Omnipotent Creator, he simply confirmed that his real property should go to his legal heirs. He had presumably made all the necessary arrangements for tax avoidance and a smooth succession well before. He left the disposition of his moveable property to his executors, whom he named as Richard Lacon and Roger Corbet. The will was proved on 18 February 1416, so he must <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for some time by that date.|$|E

25|$|A {{total of}} sixty-five Irrawaddi {{dolphins}} {{have been found}} dead {{along the coast of}} Trat Province in the past three years. The local fishing industry is blamed for the deaths of the dolphins. In January 2013, over a dozen dead Irrawaddy Dolphins were found on the coast of Thailand. It is said that these Dolphins were dead {{because of a lack of}} oxygen. Dolphins are mammals and unlike other animals that live in the sea, they must come to the surface for air. Many of the Dolphins are found dead in the water, and others were washed ashore said to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> for a few days. Also, in the first week of February 2013, as many as four Irrawaddy Dolphins were found dead.|$|E
25|$|Umlikaaq (or Umlikaq ~ Umlikqaq) or Ungllekaq (ungllik'ar in Nunivak Cup'ig) {{is fresh}} boiled fish. All {{parts of the}} fish except for the {{entrails}} are used to prepare umlikqaq. Fresh fish that <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> {{for less than a}} day make the best umlikqaq because the meat is still firm. If a freshwater fish is caught with a hook, it is best to kill the fish by hitting its head soon after capture so the meat will stay firm for cooking. The main ingredients of umlikqaq are cut-up fish, water, and salt which are boiled for about 29 minutes. This is a preferred food for elders because it easy to make and is not strongly seasoned. First heads are good prepared as umlikqaq. Also, Ungelkaaq is fish steak cut transversely.|$|E
25|$|In 1616, Samuel More accused {{his wife}} of {{adultery}} and, {{at the direction of}} his father, Richard, devised a plan to rid himself of Katherine and the children. The adultery was supposedly committed with Jacob Blakeway, a young man near in age to Katherine who lived close by and whose family had been More tenants for several generations. In 1608, Jacob Blakeway and his father Edward, a yeoman had renewed a lease on a parcel of land owned by Katherine More's father, Jasper More of Larden Hall. The manor of Larden Hall was about half a mile from Brockton where the Blakeway family lived. By a deed dated 20 April 1616, Samuel cut the entail on the Larden estate to prevent any of the children from inheriting. During the long court battle, Samuel would deny that he was the father of the children borne by his wife, Katherine, and stated them to be children of the adulterous relationship. Katherine did not deny her relationship with Jacob Blakeway, stating there was a former betrothal contract with him, and therefore he was her true husband. This would have made her marriage to Samuel invalid. Samuel quotes her words in his declaration, though she could not sufficiently prove by witnesses yet it was all one before god as she sayed. At that time any of the usual witnesses would <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead.</b>|$|E

25|$|Following his trail, {{the protagonist}} and Ora {{discover}} that Dosan has been captured by bandits, who are holding him hostage in a war-wracked Middle Eastern city and demanding that he Mark {{them with his}} remaining supply of the sumi ink. Upon being freed, Dosan explains that the flowers from whose leaves the sumi is produced have died out, and appear to <b>have</b> <b>been</b> <b>dead</b> {{at least since the}} last fresh supply of the ink was taken by the Hisomu clan. As revealed by hidden scrolls recounting the history of the clan, Azai himself had failed to defend the flowers when the devastated region to which they were endemic was taken over by vicious bandits. Thus dishonored, but {{for the sake of the}} clan's survival, Azai hid his failure and had planned the Hessian heist in order to supply the Hisomu with cutting-edge equipment now that the unique source of their strength had been extinguished. Finally, he ordered that the last of the sumi ink be used to Mark one final ninja, whose strength would enable the heist and save the clan itself from extinction at Hessian's hands. Dosan uses the remains of the sumi to give the protagonist his final tattoo, shortly before some of Azai's high tech ninja stalkers ambush them and shoot Dosan to death as he and the protagonist attempt to escape.|$|E
