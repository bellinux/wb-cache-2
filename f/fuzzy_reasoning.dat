40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{the idea}} of the neuro-fuzzy {{learning}} algorithm has been extended, by which the tuning parameters in the fuzzy rules can be learned without changing the fuzzy rule table form used in usual fuzzy applications. A new neuro-fuzzy learning algorithm {{in the case of the}} <b>fuzzy</b> singleton-type <b>reasoning</b> method has been proposed. Due to the flexibility of the <b>fuzzy</b> singleton-type <b>reasoning</b> method, the extended method is more reasonable and suitable for constructing an optimum fuzzy system model than the conventional neuro-fuzzy learning algorithm. Moreover, the efficiency of the extended neuro-fuzzy learning algorithm compared to a genetic algorithm is demonstrated by identifying a nonlinear function.

5000|$|<b>Fuzzy</b> <b>{{reasoning}}</b> (i.e., reasoning with graded concepts) {{turns out}} to have many practical uses. It is nowadays widely used in the programming of vehicle and transport electronics, household appliances, video games, language filters, robotics, all kinds of control systems, and various kinds of electronic equipment used for pattern recognition, surveying and monitoring (including radars, alarm systems and surveillance systems). <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> is also used in artificial intelligence, virtual intelligence and soft computing research.

50|$|FuzzyCLIPS is a {{fuzzy logic}} {{extension}} of the CLIPS (C Language Integrated Production System) expert system shell from NASA.

It enhances CLIPS by providing a <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> capability that is fully integrated with CLIPS facts and inference engine allowing one to represent and manipulate fuzzy facts and rules. FuzzyCLIPS can deal with exact, fuzzy (or inexact), and combined reasoning, allowing fuzzy and normal terms to be freely mixed in the rules and facts of an expert system. The system uses two basic inexact concepts, fuzziness and uncertainty. It has provided a useful environment for developing fuzzy applications but it does require significant effort to update and maintain as new versions of CLIPS are released.|$|E
40|$|<b>Fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> {{based on}} fuzzy logic was first {{proposed}} by Zadeh {{to handle the}} vague concept of reasoning in our day to day life. Since the inception of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> several extensions, specifications and applications on <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> have been developed by different researchers. <b>Fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> is now a very well established method and has a tremendous potentiality in different application areas of science and engineering.

Proceedings of the 18 th International Conference on Fuzzy Systems (FUZZ-IEEE' 09), pp. 575 - 580, 2009. <b>Fuzzy</b> interpolative <b>reasoning</b> {{plays an}} {{important}} role in fuzzy modelling as it not only helps to reduce the number of rules in a rule base, but also provides an inference mechanism for sparse rule bases. In interpolation, it is desirable to preserve piece-wise linearity as piece-wise linear results can thus be inferred from piece-wise linear rules and observations. This safely ensures the ignorance of non-characteristic points in performing interpolations. However, almost all existing <b>fuzzy</b> interpolative <b>reasoning</b> methods do not preserve piecewise linearity for general polygonal fuzzy sets. This paper, based on the work of [1], proposes a new interpolative method which preserves this property. Non peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|Adaptive fuzzy {{interpolation}} {{strengthens the}} potential of <b>fuzzy</b> interpolative <b>reasoning</b> owning to its efficient identification and correction of defective interpolated rules during the interpolation process. This approach assumes that: i) two closest adjacent rules which flank the observation or a previously inferred result are always available; ii) only single-antecedent rules are involved. In practice, however, variable values of these rules may lie just {{on one side of}} the observation or inferred result. Also, there may be certain rules with multiple antecedents in the rule base. This paper extends the adaptive approach, in order to cover fuzzy extrapolation and to support rule base with multiple-antecedent rules. Adaptive fuzzy interpolation and extrapolation complement each other, which jointly improve the applicability of <b>fuzzy</b> interpolative <b>reasoning,</b> as it significantly reduces the restriction over the given rule base...|$|R

These problems are (1) the lack of design for a membership function except a heuristic approach and (2) the lack of adaptability for possible changes in the reasoning environment. The proposed <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> approach solves these problems by using the learning function and nonlinearity of an NN. First, the problems involved in conventional <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> and the NN used in this paper are identified.

40|$|AbstractIn this paper, {{we study}} the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> {{based on a}} new fuzzy rough set. First, we define a broad family of new lower and upper {{approximation}} operators of fuzzy sets between different universes using a set of axioms. Then, based on the approximation operators above, we propose the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> based on the new fuzzy rough set. By means of the above <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> based on the new fuzzy rough set, for a given premise, we can obtain the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> consequence expressed by the fuzzy interval constructed by the above two approximations of fuzzy sets. Furthermore, through the defuzzification of the lower and upper approximations, {{we can get the}} corresponding two values constructing the interval used as the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> consequence after defuzzification. Then, from the above interval, a suitable value can be selected as the final reasoning consequence so that some special constraints are satisfied as possibly. At last, we apply the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> based on the new fuzzy rough set to the scheduling problems, and numerical computational results show that the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> based on the new fuzzy rough set is more suitable for the scheduling problems compared with the <b>fuzzy</b> <b>reasoning</b> based on the CRI method and the III method...|$|E
