50|$|From {{time to time}} {{a system}} forms a new concept or {{eliminates}} an old one. At every level, the NMF system always keeps a reserve of vague (fuzzy) inactive concept-models. They are inactive in that their parameters are not adapted to the data; therefore their similarities to signals are low. Yet, because of a large vagueness (covariance) the similarities are not exactly zero. When a new signal does not fit well {{into any of the}} active models, its similarities to inactive models automatically increase (because first, every piece of data is accounted for, and second, inactive models are vague-fuzzy and potentially can “grab” every signal that does not fit into more specific, less fuzzy, active models. When the activation signal am for an inactive model, m, exceeds a certain threshold, the model is activated. Similarly, when an activation signal for a particular model falls below a threshold, the model is deactivated. Thresholds for activation and deactivation are set usually based on information existing at a higher hierarchical level (prior <b>information,</b> <b>system</b> <b>resources,</b> numbers of activated models of various types, etc.). Activation signals for active models at a particular level { am } form a “neuronal field,” which serve as input signals to the next level, where more abstract and more general concepts are formed.|$|E
