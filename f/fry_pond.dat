Each pond was stocked with size # 24 sex-reversed tilapia fingerlings at a density of 4 pcs/m 2. The kinds of hatching system where the tilapia fry were hatched served as the treatments in this study and were as follows: I – artificial incubation-hatched fry, II – hapa-hatched fry, III – pond-hatched fry and IV – combination of hatched fry by stocking 33. 3 % from each hatching system. Each treatment was replicated three times. After the pond rearing, analysis of variance indicated no significant differences on the gain in length, gain in weight, specific growth rate, sex conversion rate and survival of tilapia fingerlings among treatments (P> 0. 05).

40|$|The post-larvae and fry of Australian native species, {{including}} those of species belonging to the family Percichthyidae, are routinely reared to a fingerling size (35 - 55 mm in length) in fertilised earthen <b>fry</b> rearing <b>ponds.</b> The juveniles of Murray cod (Maccullochella peelii peelii trout cod (Maccullochella macquariensis) and Macquarie perch (Macquaria australasicd) (Percichthyidae) are grown in <b>fry</b> rearing <b>ponds</b> at the Marine and Freshwater Resources Institute, Snobs Creek (Vie. Australia) for production of fingerlings for stock enhancement and aquaculture purposes. However, no detailed studies have been undertaken of the productivity of these ponds and factors that influence fish production. An ecologically based study was undertaken to increase the knowledge of pond ecology and dynamics, particularly {{in relation to the}} rearing of juvenile Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch in ponds. Over nine consecutive seasons commencing in 1991, water chemistry, plankton, macrobenthos (2 seasons only) and fish were monitored and studied in five ponds located at Snobs Creek. A total of 80 pond fillings were undertaken during the study period. Additional data collected from another 24 pond fillings undertaken at Snobs Creek collected prior to this study were included in some analyses. Water chemistry parameters monitored in the ponds included, temperature, dissolved oxygen pH, ammonia, nitrite, nitrate, orthophosphate and alkalinity. Water chemistry varied spatially (within and between ponds) and temporally (diurnally, daily and seasonally). Liming of ponds increased the total alkalinity to levels that were considered to be suitable for enhancing plankton communities and fish production. Water quality within the ponds for the most part was suitable for the rearing of juvenile Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch, as reflected in overall production (growth, survival and yield) from the ponds. However, at times some parameters reached levels which may have stressed fish and reduced growth and survival, in particular, low dissolved oxygen concentrations (minimum 1. 18 mg/L), high temperatures (maximum 34 °C), high pH (maximum 10. 38) and high unionised ammonia (maximum 0. 58 mg/L). Species belonging to 37 phytoplankton, 45 zooplankton and 17 chironomid taxa were identified from the ponds during the study. In addition, an extensive checklist of aquatic flora and fauna, recorded from aquaculture ponds in south-eastern Australia, was compiled. However, plankton and benthos samples were usually numerically dominated by a few species only. Rotifers (especially Filinia, Brachionus, Polyarthra, and Asplanchnd), cladocerans (Moina and Daphnid) and copepods (Mesocyclops and Boeckelld) were most abundant and common in the plankton, while chironomids (Chironomus, Polypedilum, and Prodadius) and oligochaetes were most common and abundant in the benthos. Both abundance and species composition of the plankton and macrobenthos varied spatially (within and between ponds) and temporally (diurnally, daily and seasonally). Chlorophyll a concentrations, which ranged from 1. 8 to 184 /L (mean 29. 37 ng/L), initially peaked within two weeks of filling and fertilising the ponds. Zooplankton peaked in abundance 2 - 4 weeks after filling the ponds. The maximum zooplankton density recorded in the ponds was 6, 621 ind. /L (mean 721 ind. /L). Typically, amongst the zooplankton, rotifers were first to develop high densities (2 nd- 3 rd week after filling), followed by cladocerans (2 nd- 4 th week after filling) then copepods (2 nd- 5 th week after filling). Chironomid abundance on average peaked later (during the 5 th week after filling). The maximum chironomid density recorded in the ponds was 27, 470 ind. /m 2 (mean 4, 379 ind. /m 2). Length-weight, age-weight and age-length relationships were determined for juvenile Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch reared in ponds. These relationships were most similar for Murray cod and trout cod, which are more closely related phylogenetically and similar morphologically than Macquarie perch. Growth of fish was negatively correlated with both size at stocking and stocking biomass. Stocking density experiments showed that, at higher densities, growth offish was significantly reduced, but survival was not affected. The diets of juvenile Murray cod trout cod and Macquarie perch reared in <b>fry</b> <b>ponds</b> were similar. The cladocerans Moina and Daphnia, adult calanoid and cyclopoid copepods and the chironomids, Chironomus, Polypedilum and Procladius were the most commonly occurring and abundant prey. Selection for rotifers and copepod nauplii was strongly negative for all three species of fish. Size range of prey consumed was positively correlated with fish size for trout cod and Macquarie perch, but not for Murray cod. Diet composition changed as the fish grew. Early after stocking the fish into the ponds, Moina was generally the more common prey consumed, while in latter weeks, copepods and chironomids became more abundant and common in the diet. On a dry weight basis, chironomid larvae were the most important component in the diets of these fish species. Selective feeding by fish on larger planktonic species such as adult copepods and cladocerans, may have influenced the plankton community structure as proposed by the trophic cascade or top -down hypothesis. The proximate composition and energy content of Murray cod, trout cod and Macquarie perch, reared in the ponds did not vary significantly between the species, and few significant changes were observed as the fish grew. These results suggested that the nutrient requirements of these species might not vary over the size range of fish examined. Significant differences in the proximate composition of prey were observed between species, size of species and time of season. The energy content of prey (cladocerans, copepods and chironomids) on a pond basis, was closely related to the abundance of these taxa in the ponds. Data collected from all pond fillings during the present study, along with historical data from pond fillings undertaken prior to this study, were combined in a data matrix and analysed for interactions between pairs of parameters. In particular, interactions between selected water chemistry parameters, zooplankton and chironomid abundance indicators were analysed to identify key factors that influence fish production (growth, survival, condition and yield). Significant correlations were detected between fish production indicators and several water chemistry and biota (zooplankton and chironomids) parameters. However, these were not consistent across all three species of fish. These results indicated that the interactions between water chemistry, biota and fish were complex, and that combinations of these parameters, along with other factors not included in the present study, may influence fish production in these ponds. The present study, showed that more stringent monitoring of <b>fry</b> rearing <b>ponds,</b> especially water quality, zooplankton and benthos communities and fish, combined with an associated increase in understanding of the pond ecosystem, can lead to substantial improvements in pond productivity and associated fish production. In the present study this has resulted in a general increase in fish survival rates, which became less variable or more predictable in nature. The value of such knowledge can provide managers with a more predicative capacity to estimate production of ponds in support of stock enhancement programs and provision of juvenile for aquaculture grow-out...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{endangered}} Australian {{freshwater fish}} trout cod, Maccullochella macquariensis (Cuvier), {{was the subject}} of a captive breeding programme to produce fry for reintroduction into the wild. Trout cod broodfish were maintained in earthen ponds for up to 5 years and underwent gonadal maturation each spring but did not spawn in the ponds. Infestations of the protozoan parasite Chilodonella hexasticha caused the death of at least 21 broodfish. Mature fish, removed from ponds when water temperatures had reached or exceeded 16 °C, had a higher proportion of atretic oocytes and fewer fish spawned successfully compared to fish removed at lower temperatures. Ovulation was induced by a single injection of 1000 – 3000 iu/kg HCG. Between 1188 and 11338 eggs ranging from 2 · 5 to 3 · 6 mm in diameter were stripped from individual fish. Hatching commenced on days 5 – 9 and continued for up to 10 days (at 15 · 5 – 23 °C). Larvae commenced feeding on days 21 – 25. Trout cod larvae were grown out to fry (363. 3 – 48. 6 mm total length [TL]) in fertilized <b>fry</b> rearing <b>ponds</b> then released. Between 1986 and 1989, 8420 trout cod fry were released into several sites in the upper Murray River and upper Murrumbidgee River, and reports indicate that released fish are surviving.

40|$|Sexual {{maturity}} of largemouth bass (Micropterus salmoides) is believed by some investigators {{to depend on}} size rather than on age (1). Most authors report a minimum total length of about 250 mm for sexually mature female northern largemouth bass (M. s. salmoides), noting that males may spawn at somewhat smaller sizes (1, 2). Chew (3) reported a similar minimum spawning size for the Florida subspecies, M. s. floridanus. Swingle and Smith (4) reported that largemouth bass weighing less than 140 g (corresponding to bass 220 - 230 mm in the present study) always failed to spawn in Alabama ponds. Clugston (5), who reared both subspecies in southern Florida, reported that Florida largemouth bass became sexually mature when they were 9 months old and 230 - 290 mm long.

The appearance of bass <b>fry</b> in <b>ponds</b> near Stillwater, Oklahoma, containing only age I Florida or northern largemouth bass (length range, 122 - 175 mm) suggested that both subspecies may reproduce at total lengths 80 to 120 mm shorter than the generally accepted minimum length for sexual maturity.

A distinct change in pigmentation accompanied the change in feeding behaviour. Fry reared in hatchery ponds were obligate zooplanktivores between 10 and 17 mm.

30|$|Soil {{and water}} {{pollution}} is another serious problem associated with the shrimp industry. Besides the poor quality of shrimp fry, pollution {{is said to be}} an important cause of continuous shrimp losses. The practice of releasing high stocking densities of shrimp <b>fry</b> into <b>ponds</b> to maximize profits under the practice of intensive and semi-intensive types of shrimp culture, often leads to high levels of feeds, chemicals, and antibiotics being used in ponds. Effluence including chemical inputs and waste from shrimp farming ponds are often released directly into the natural environment without any treatment, even in the case of shrimp disease outbreaks. This is a direct source of contamination to soil, rivers and coastal habitats. Moreover, theoretically, it is good to raise shrimps in the dry season. However, because of repeated shrimp losses, farmers want to make up for their lost shrimp crops quickly and often expand the shrimp-raising time beyond the dry season. As a result, farmers raise shrimp throughout the year by keeping saline water in their ponds even in the rainy season. Unlike scientists who can figure out the scale of pollution by scientific measures, farmers measure this problem by observing their shrimp products. Farmers reported that in the past when only a few people engaged in shrimp culture and shrimp were raised using low stocking densities, the shrimp-raising environment was good. Even though they did not pay much attention to taking care of shrimp or apply many technological measures, farmers could succeed remarkably with low investment. Now, with many farmers raising shrimp more intensively by increasing stocking density and the frequency of shrimp crops, despite being backed by advanced technology and aquatic engineers, farmers still frequently lose their crops. Moreover, the practice of using prohibited harmful chemicals that rapidly and effectively kill competing species or stimulate shrimp to shed their exoskeleton so that they grow more quickly, is said to cause certain damage to the ecosystem of shrimp farming areas. However, because of their low expense and lack of immediate impact to shrimp ponds, this practice of chemical use is still widely adopted by shrimp farmers in the Mekong Delta.|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was a comphensive {{assessment}} of the food of pikeperch fry in the monoculture rearing from the stage of summer fry to the stage of autumn <b>fry</b> in <b>ponds</b> with three different types of management and assessment of the influence of individual treatments for pikeperch production. The experiment was performed in small ponds in experimental facility of FFPW in Vodňany. The variants of pond treatment were: a) ponds with additional prey fish (fry of common carp (C. carpio) and grass carp (C. idella)), b) ponds with installed substrate from heather, c) control variant without any support of natural food of pikeperch. All treatments had four repetitions. Rearing of pikeperch fry lasted 97 days. In all treatments, the opportunistic food strategy of pikeperch fry was recorded during the whole period of rearing and the main recorded food was macrozoobenthos, especially insect larvae. Bigger species of zooplankton had also been often found in the stomachs of pikeperch. Considerable development of macrozoobenthos in all experimental ponds was probably caused by the presence of submerged macrophytes. Thus, this factor made harder to estimate influence of installed substrates from heather for production of pikeperch fry and composition of its food. In the treatment with prey fish, the total length (F (9. 450) = 91. 1; p < 10 - 3) and weight (F (9. 450) = 61. 9; p < 10 - 3) of pikeperch fry were for the whole period of rearing significantly higher in comparison to the other treatments. In addition, the survival of pikeperch in the treatment with prey fish reached to 56 - 92, 4 % at the end of rearing. In the treatment with substrate from heather, the total length and weight of pikeperch was significantly higher in comparison to the control treatment only in the first term of sampling. In the rest of pikeperch fry rearing period were the values comparable or higher in control treatment. Thus, for the rearing of pikeperch from the stage of summer fry to the stage of autumn fry is appropriate to stock prey fish in ponds. In comparison to installation of artificial substrate, the diversity of water environment, which is subsequently able to provide sufficiently wide natural food for reared pikeperch, seems to be more decisive...|$|R

40|$|In Kenya, Nile tilapia (Oreochromis niloticus) {{is mostly}} grown in ponds. To avoid {{excessive}} reproduction and stunted growth, fingerlings {{are treated with}} methyl-testosterone to make all-male populations (monosex). For a national breeding programme that aims to provide genetically improved broodstock to hatcheries that supply monosex <b>fry</b> to smallholder <b>pond</b> farmers, {{it is important to}} assess the genetic correlation (r g) for traits between the mixed sex breeding candidates from the breeding nucleus and monosex production fish. The {{purpose of the study was}} to estimate genetic parameters for harvest weight (HW), daily growth coefficient (DGC) and body shape and investigate genotype by environment interaction (G × E) for these traits between mixed sex and monosex populations. Forty-eight sires and 76 dams from the F 2 generation of a local O. niloticus strain, kept at Sagana Aquaculture Research Station, Kenya were used to produce 76 full-sib families. Mixed sex fry (3 days old) from each full sib family were divided into two groups of 50 individuals each. One group (monosex) was fed a diet treated with methyl-testosterone to induce sex reversal while the other group (mixed sex) was reared on a control diet. After hapa rearing, tagging and weighing, fish were randomly divided and stocked in six earthen ponds, three for mixed sex and three for monosex fish. After 5 months, fish were harvested, photographed and weighed. Genetic parameter estimates for HW, DGC, and shape were obtained on 2105 fish. Heritability estimates for HW, DGC and shape were 0. 21 ± 0. 03, 0. 26 ± 0. 04 and 0. 12 ± 0. 03 for mixed sex respectively. Genetic correlations for HW between monosex and mixed sex was 0. 74 ± 0. 14, suggesting low G × E. The corresponding r g for DGC and shape were lower; 0. 59 ± 0. 10, and - 0. 19 ± 0. 11, respectively, denoting the presence of G × E. It is concluded that G × E between the mixed sex nucleus and monosex production fish is important, and that a breeding programme for Nile tilapia needs to include production performance from monosex siblings. Statement of relevance: First study that reports estimates for Genotype by treatment interaction between hormone treated monosex Nile tilapia and mixed sex Nile tilapia, and discusses the consequences for nucleus breeding programmes. </p...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 1969 A {{study of}} the distribution, {{relative}} abundance and diet of fishes sympatric with juvenile sockeye salmon, Oncorhynchus nerka (Walbaum), within the freshwater nursery areas of the Naknek River system was undertaken from 1961 to 1963. The study {{was part of an}} extensive investigation to determine what factors in the freshwater environment were limiting the size of the populations of sockeye salmon returning to the rivers of Bristol Bay, Alaska. The speties found associated with juvenile salmon in the limnetic zones of the Naknek system were the pond smelt, Hypomesus olidus (Pallas); the least cisco, Coregonus sardinella Valenciennes; the threespine stickleback, Gasterosteus aculeatus Linnaeus; and the ninespine stickleback, Pungitius pungitius (Linnaeus). Life history information was collected for these sympatric species. Tow nets were used to capture samples of fish from the limnetic portions of the nursery areas. Some samples were collected by beach seines, lake traps and otter trawls. Plankton samples were collected and compared to the diets of the limnetic fishes. Although some confusion has existed in the literature, I concluded that pond smelt of the Naknek system belong to Hypomesus olidus (Pallas). The populations of smelt were comprised of six age-groups in the late summer, but most specimens belonged to three age-groups. Most members of the species spawn in the spring of the fourth year of life. The estimated fecundity ranged from 900 to 4, 300 eggs per female. Seven age-groups of least ciscoes were present in the populations of the Naknek system. The species in the Naknek system probably spawned {{for the first time in}} the fall of their fourth year. The estimated fecundity of two specimens was 4, 006 and 14, 380 eggs. Populations of three spine stickleback were comprised of three age-groups of fish. I was unable to assign ages to ninespine stickleback. Estimates of the fecundity of the species ranged from 116 to 456 eggs per female. All species studied were distributed throughout the Naknek system. The relative abundance of the fishes studied was variable between and within nursery areas and from year to year. The population densities of pond smelt and threespine stickleback were larger in the surface waters compared to the deep waters. The relative abundance of sockeye fry, yearlings and ninespine stickleback was greater in the surface stratum rather than the deep stratum in most nursery areas. The five main food items utilized by these limnetic species were cladocerans (Bosmina sp. and Daphnia sp.); copepods (cyclopoid copepods and Diaptomus sp.); and Dipteran insects. Analysis of the similarity of diets indicated that the diets of sockeye <b>fry</b> and <b>pond</b> smelt were more similar than were the diets of sockeye fry or yearlings and any other sympatric species. The diet of sockeye fry was more similar to that of either species of stickleback than was the diet of sockeye yearlings. An analysis of the food of various sizes of each species of fish indicated the diets of three age-groups of smelt were more similar than the diets of various age-groups of any other fish. The food composition of three age-groups of ciscoes and two size groups of both species of stickleback showed a strong positive correlation. The diets of sockeye fry and yearlings showed the weakest positive correlation of the species studied. All species of fish studied selectively fed on one or more components of the zooplankton. Daphnia sp. and cyclopoid copepods were strongly selected in Lake Coville. Cyclopoids were selected in South Bay. Bosmina sp. was selected from the waters of West End. In Lake Coville, the greatest potential competition for food probably existed between the large populations of pond smelt and sockeye fry. In the West End nursery area, potential competition between juvenile salmon and both species of stickleback may not be severe, depending on the age composition of the salmon population present in the nursery area. The possibility exists that the relatively low numbers of adult sockeye salmon returning to the comparatively rich lakes of the Naknek River system is due to the presence of large populations of sympatric species of fish. Each of these sympatric species feed on the same general types of food organisms as do the juvenile salmon and may affect the numbers of young salmon that leave the lake, and subsequently return from the ocean...|$|R
