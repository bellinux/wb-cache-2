5|$|As Jim Brown's star rose, players {{began to}} {{question}} Paul Brown's leadership and play-calling in the late 1950s. The skepticism {{came to a head}} in a game against the Giants {{at the end of the}} 1958 season in which a win or tie would have given the Browns a spot in the championship game against Ewbank's Colts. In the third quarter, the Browns drove to New York's 16-yard line with a 10–3 lead and lined up for a field goal. But Coach Brown called a timeout before Groza could make the try, which alerted the Giants to a possible fake kick. Brown indeed called a fake, and the holder stumbled as <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> throw, ruining the play. The Giants came back to win the game by a field goal and reach the championship, while the Browns went home without a spot in the title game for the second year in a row.|$|E
25|$|Beethoven is {{reported}} to have dated his hearing loss from a fit he suffered in 1798 induced by a rage at the interruption of his work—having fallen over, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> find himself deaf. His hearing only ever partially recovered and, during its gradual decline, was impeded by a severe form of tinnitus. As early as 1801, he wrote to friends describing his symptoms and the difficulties they caused in both professional and social settings (although it is likely some of his close friends were already aware of the problems).|$|E
25|$|In {{his third}} race, the Brazilian Grand Prix, he {{qualified}} in fourth place. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> {{second on the}} first lap {{and there was a}} safety car due to an incident in the first corner. On the restart, which was on the third lap, Montoya passed World Champion Michael Schumacher into the first corner. He held off Schumacher, who was on a two-stop strategy compared to Montoya's one stop strategy until Schumacher's first stop. Montoya now seemed to have the race in his pocket as he had a five-second advantage over eventual winner David Coulthard. However, while he was lapping Jos Verstappen, the Dutchman accidentally rammed into the back of him, taking Montoya out.|$|E
60|$|George Dixon didn't say a word; {{the shame}} of it was a'most more than 'e could stand. Then <b>'e</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> go out o' the parlour and Charlie pushed 'im back agin. Three times he tried, and then 'e stood {{up and looked at}} 'is wife.|$|R

25|$|It {{was then}} that he joined the All-England Eleven, playing his first game for them at Newark-on-Trent. This meant Caesar would now tour the country, playing cricket, and {{receiving}} somewhere between £4 and £6 from Clarke, from which he {{would also have to}} pay his expenses. Caesar's form dropped, which would have made him more anxious about his place, and <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> some strange antics at hotels. He became irrationally nervous fearing that someone may have died in his bed, or that the hotel would burn down. One time, after yells from a drunkard outside, Caesar convinced himself that there was a fire and rang the alarm bell, causing minor panic amongst the other guests.|$|E
25|$|At the , Räikkönen {{qualified}} 9th. However, {{he managed}} to get up to 5th place on the first lap of the race. He retained this position for most of the race, finishing in 5th place. A few days after the Spanish Grand Prix, he admitted that he had no chance of winning the 2006 Championship. In Monaco, Räikkönen qualified third. During the race <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> 2nd and kept pace with Alonso, however he retired during a safety car period after a failed heat shield led to a wiring loom inside the car catching fire. After the retirement he was seen on live TV walking along the Monaco sidewalks with his helmet still on to the harbour and climbing aboard a yacht.|$|E

Weather {{conditions}} {{at the start of}} the race were sunny and hot with an air temperature of [...] and a track temperature of [...] Windy conditions made the track dusty. When the race started, Vandoorne maintained his pole position advantage heading into the first corner. His teammate Matsushita made a slow start, and his anti-stall system activated, allowing several cars to get ahead of him before <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speed. Nato made a good start, moving from seventh to third while Lynn inherited second position. Sørensen's car was damaged while fending off an overtaking manoeuvre by de Jong. Rossi overtook his teammate King to move into seventh place on the same lap and started to close the gap with Pic and Gasly. Sørensen drove into the pit lane to retire because of the damage sustained from de Jong's passing manoeuvre.|$|E
60|$|The {{little man}} stared at me; then, {{deliberately}} disencumbering himself of surcingle, threads, and implements, <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up,</b> advanced <b>to</b> me, {{and held out}} his hand.|$|R

2500|$|Feldhendler {{was among}} those who survived the war, hiding in Lublin until the end of German occupation. The city was taken by the Soviet Red Army on 24 July 1944, and became the {{temporary}} headquarters of the Soviet-controlled communist Polish Committee of National Liberation established by Joseph Stalin. However, on 2 April 1945, Feldhendler was shot through the closed door of his flat as <b>he</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> investigate a commotion in an outer room. [...] Feldhendler and his wife managed to escape through another door and made their way to Lublin's Św. Wincentego á Paulo hospital, where he underwent surgery but died four days later. [...] According to most of the older publications, Feldhendler was killed by right-wing Polish nationalists, sometimes identified as the Narodowe Siły Zbrojne, an anti-Communist and anti-Semitic partisan unit (name unknown). [...] However, more recent inquiries, citing the incomplete treatment of the event by earlier historians, and the scant documentary record, have called into question this version of events.|$|E

60|$|The {{following}} morning at daybreak, Jim was awakened from a sound sleep by some one calling at his window. <b>He</b> <b>got</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> learn who it was, and, {{in the gray}} light, saw Edwards standing outside.|$|E
