40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we propose a <b>generic</b> <b>frame</b> for the {{implementation}} of a dual-core processor with two modes of operation. One is the safety mode that allows to run the two cores in lock step in a classical master/checker fashion. A clock delay of 1. 5 clock cycles between master and checker establishes the temporal redundancy to minimize the potential for common mode faults. The second operation mode allows a parallel execution of different instruction streams on the two cores in a multiprocessor fashion. The possibility to dynamically switch between the two modes allows for an efficient utilization of the duplicated core. We propose an implementation of such a <b>generic</b> <b>frame</b> that can be applied in conjunction with virtually any standard processor core. Also we perform a systematic failure analysis for the safety mode and the mode switching procedure. Experimental fault injection confirms that our reconfigurable architecture indeed provides the same fail safe properties as the classical master/checker architecture. I...|$|E

40|$|Background: One {{of the key}} {{elements}} to enhance the uptake of evidence in public health policies is stimulating cross-sector collaboration. An intervention stimulating collaboration is a policy game. The {{aim of this study}} was to describe the design and methods of the development process of the policy game 'In 2 Action' within a real-life setting of public health policymaking networks in the Netherlands, Denmark and Romania. Methods: The development of the policy game intervention consisted of three phases, pre intervention, designing the game intervention and tailoring the intervention. Results: In 2 Action was developed as a role-play game of one day, with main focus to develop in collaboration a cross-sector implementation plan based on the approved strategic local public health policy. Conclusions: This study introduced an innovative intervention for public health policymaking. It described the design and development of the <b>generic</b> <b>frame</b> of the In 2 Action game focusing on enhancing collaboration in local public health policymaking networks.

40|$|Abstract: This study {{presented}} a new {{data link layer}} design for the virtual bus architecture. The virtual bus is a hierarchical access network offered a broadcast capability for data and signaling. The proposed {{of the study is}} to support Quality of Service (QoS) in network. During study, the most promising technology capable of delivering full service access at high data rates is Synchronous Digital Hierarchy (SDH) /Synchronous Optical Networking (SONET). For that reason, we develop SDH/SONET as a physical layer for the virtual bus network. The main goal of this investigation was to study the performance of transmission medium and the overall performance of the network. We exemplify a Multiple Access Protocol (MAP) with <b>Generic</b> <b>Frame</b> Procedure (GFP) for transmitting IP network protocol datagram over SDH/SONET. This is a novel method for transmitting MAP with GFP. The protocol adds multi-terminal access capability to an inherently point-to-point link.
