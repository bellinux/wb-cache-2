40|$|The {{purpose of}} this article is to {{evaluate}} how effective and efficient e-learning and blended learning is when compared with traditional face-to-face learning in orthodontic education. This article also provides a comparison between <b>face-to-face</b> learning, <b>e-learning,</b> and blended learning. An open PubMed literature search was done from 1980 to 2015, and a total of 23 relevant key articles were reviewed. Information emerging from studies in orthodontic education has indicated that e-learning classes are at least as good as and/or better than face-to-face classroom learning. Till date, only one study stated that the face-to-face conventional learning is better than e-learning. Two studies stated that blended approach using both traditional <b>face-to-face</b> learning and <b>e-learning</b> is the best method. In one study, the advantages of e-learning observed in the theoretical fields of orthodontics were not achieved in learning practical procedures for manual skills. Few studies found improvements in the efficiency of learning with e-learning program. Studies performed through questionnaires showed that student's attitude and acceptance toward the use of e-learning was positive and favorable; however, blended learning was always rated high.

40|$|This study {{investigated}} attitudinal {{factors in the}} transition from <b>face-to-face</b> to <b>e-learning</b> in Tanzanian higher learning institutions. Five objectives guided the study: first, it examined teachers’ understanding of e-learning. Secondly, it examined teachers’ attitudes towards e-learning. Further it developed an e-learning attitude scale. It also explored barriers that can hinder the transition from <b>face-to-face</b> to <b>e-learning</b> and finally, it identified strategies that can optimise teachers’ and students’ involvement in e-learning. The Technology Acceptance Model (Davis 1986) guided this study and a Test of e-Learning Related Attitudes (TeLRA) scale was developed to assess the teachers’ attitudes. The study used a mixed methods approach {{under the umbrella of}} pragmatic philosophical assumption. It involved 269 respondents, obtained through stratified simple random sampling and purposive sampling. Questionnaires, semi-structured interviews and documentary review were used in data collection. All quantitative and qualitative data were respectively analysed using statistical package for the social sciences (SPSS) and thematic analysis. Chi-square, logistic regression and multiple regression were performed to examine the association of variables and their predictive power. Principal Component Analysis (PCA) was used to derive empirical constructs from the developed TeLRA scale. The findings revealed that teaching experience and qualifications had a statistically significant contribution to teachers’ understanding of e-learning. Computer exposure and e-learning understanding had a statistically significant contribution to teachers’ attitudes toward e-learning. Poor infrastructure, financial constraints, inadequate support, lack of e-learning knowledge and teachers’ resistance to change also had a strong influence on the adoption of e-learning. The study also showed that teacher-to-students and students-to-content interactions as useful strategies to optimise teachers’ and students’ involvement in e-learning. Findings from this study have contributed to knowledge based on teachers’ understanding of, and attitudes towards e-learning in Tanzania and assisted in developing a factorial valid and reliable attitude scale measure. It is recommended that training in e-learning needs to be provided to teachers to widen their understanding of e-learning. There is also a need to strengthen factors associated with teachers’ positive attitudes towards e-learning and to address the barriers identified in this study...|$|R

One such problematic area is that of assessment, which is surprising given that, as Ramsden has succinctly observed “assessment always defines the actual curriculum. ” 1 Moreover, e-learning assessment procedures are more critical in defining the learning that takes place because “Coordinators and deliverers of online units of study have {{a different set of}} restrictions and advantages compared to the more traditional forms of delivery. ” 2 Hence, Graham argues, e-learning requires two types of feedback, “information feedback ” and “acknowledgement feedback. ” The former provides information or evaluation, such as an assignment grade and comments, and is also present with face-to-face delivery. The latter “acknowledgement feedback” confirms that an event has occurred – as Graham points out “in a face-to-face course, acknowledgement feedback is usually implicit. Eye contact, for example, indicates that the instructor has heard a student’s comments; seeing a completed assignment in the instructor’s hands confirms receipt. ” 3 Unlike <b>face-to-face</b> delivery, <b>e-learning</b> courses lack such tacit and latent feedback, which hence has to be supplied by other means – with the tutor ensuring that students ar...|$|R

Literature on implementation strategies has been restricted to the final reporting of studies with little opportunity to describe relevant contextual, developmental and supporting work that would allow for a better interpretation of results and enhance the likelihood of successful replication of interventions. Therefore, {{in this paper we}} describe the theoretical and empirical background, the material and practical starting points of the program. We monitored the number of professionals that were trained during and after a cluster randomized trial in which the effects of the program have been examined. Each element of the intervention (Train-the-Trainer element, one day <b>face-to-face</b> training, <b>e-learning)</b> is described in detail. During the trial, 518 professionals were trained by 37 trainers. After the trial over 5000 professionals and 180 gatekeepers were trained. The e-learning module for trainees is currently being implemented among 30 mental health care institutions in The Netherlands. These results suggest that an e-learning supported Train-the-Trainer program is an efficient way to uptake new interventions by professionals. The face-to-face training was easily replicable so it was easy to adhere to the training protocol. E-learning made the distribution of the training material more viable, although the distribution was limited by problems with ICT facilities. Overall, the intervention was well received by both trainers and trainees.
