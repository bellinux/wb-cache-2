A line e. g. photodiode line, detector (460) is provided for detecting the spectral constituents of the radiation emanating from the range on the geometrical line. A dispersive-element deflector is designed to deflect the element on the axis of rotation, so that a radiation from another range of the geometrical line is incident on the line detector depending on an angle of deflection. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for the following: (1) a method for the spectral detection of a geometrical line (2) a method for the examination of a <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> (3) a computer program with a program code for performing a method for the spectral detection of a geometrical line (4) a computer program with a program code for performing a method for the examination of a <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface.</b> USE - Used for detecting spectral information of a geometrical line and in a system for examining a <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> (claimed). ADVANTAGE - The apparatus effectively detects the spectral information of a geometrical line, is lightweight and fabricated at a low cost while providing sufficient geometrical resolution.

30|$|The {{structures}} of the protoplanetary disk have been examined under various conditions of the stellar wind and the mass distribution of the disk, by assuming that the disk is steady and geometrically thick. T Tauri stars are commonly accompanied by disks {{as well as the}} stellar wind. Therefore, the disk around a T Tauri star should be influenced by the stellar wind. The height of the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> of the disk is suppressed by the dynamical pressure of the wind but depends very weakly on the wind strength. The surface becomes slightly higher when the wind strength becomes weaker. Furthermore, the dependency on the mass distribution of the disk is also weak. As a natural result, the temperature distribution in the disk is insensitive to the wind strength and also the mass distribution of the disk. Thus, we can conclude that the temperature and the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> height of the disk under the stellar wind does not depend on either the wind properties or the mass distribution of the disk.|$|E

40|$|A new {{approach}} {{which leads to}} tool-surface structures with improved tribological properties in cold forming processes is presented. This approach {{is based on the}} one hand on an increase of wear resistance and, on the other hand on the general idea to use the remaining wear mechanisms itselfs for the production of a defined <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> structure during forming (self-forming phenomenon). This effect is initiated by a predefined three-dimensional material structure; i. e. a 30 -surface structure is created out of a 30 material structure "in situ". In practice, the creation of a defined three-dimensional material structure can be realized by local application of thermal or thermo-chemical surface-treatment techniques. The difference in material properties between thermally implanted zones and matrix material finally leads to a functional gradient in the tribological system. The matrix wears off faster compared to the implanted areas and produces the required surface structure. Therefore, regarding the appearance of wear mechanisms, this defined functional gradient of material structure has the effect, that within the tribological system originally uncontrolled wear becomes an instrument of controlled <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> structuring. Starting from theoretical considerations on the influence of different wear mechanisms on structural changes of tool surfaces during forming, a special technique of laser treatment (thermal implantation) leading to three-dimensional material structures in the surface zone of tool steel is presented. Tribological experiments were conducted at different contact pressures to see how the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> structure evolves. The tests were run for varying length of time and three-dimensional surface topography was utilised to obtain the evolution of surface structure resulting from different wear mechanisms with time. Therefore, cold-forging tools with different geometries were treated and applied under practical forming conditions. The surface quality of the final products was inspected by 3 D-measurement...|$|E

40|$|A local Hawking {{temperature}} is derived for any future outer trapping horizon in spherical symmetry, using a Hamilton-Jacobi {{variant of the}} Parikh-Wilczek tunneling method. It is given by a dynamical surface gravity as defined geometrically. The operational meaning of the {{temperature is}} that Kodama observers just outside the horizon measure an invariantly redshifted temperature, diverging at the horizon itself. In static, asymptotically flat cases, the Hawking temperature as usually defined by the Killing vector agrees in standard cases, but generally differs by a relative redshift factor between the horizon and infinity, being the temperature measured by static observers at infinity. Likewise, the <b>geometrical</b> <b>surface</b> gravity reduces to the Newtonian surface gravity in the Newtonian limit, while the Killing definition instead reflects measurements at infinity.

40|$|Bearing the {{thermodynamic}} arguments {{together with}} the two definitions of mass in mind, we try to find metrics with spherical symmetry. We consider the adiabatic condition along with the Gong-Wang mass, and evaluate the $g_{rr}$ element which points to a null hypersurface. In addition, we generalize the thermodynamics laws to this hypersurface to find its temperature and thus the corresponding surface gravity which enables us to get a relation for the $g_{tt}$ element. Moreover, we investigate the mathematical and physical properties of the discovered metric in the Einstein relativity framework which shows that the primary mentioned null hypersurface is an event horizon. The obtained energy-momentum tensor equals the energy-momentum tensor of a polytropic black hole embedded into an anti-de Sitter background.
