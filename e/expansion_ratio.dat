5|$|Because the liquid-to-gas <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> of {{nitrogen}} is 1:694 at 20°C, {{a tremendous amount}} of force can be generated if liquid nitrogen is rapidly vaporised in an enclosed space. In an incident on January 12, 2006 at Texas A University, the pressure-relief devices of a tank of liquid nitrogen were malfunctioning and later sealed. As a result of the subsequent pressure buildup, the tank failed catastrophically. The force of the explosion was sufficient to propel the tank through the ceiling immediately above it, shatter a reinforced concrete beam immediately below it, and blow the walls of the laboratory 0.1–0.2m off their foundations.|$|E
5|$|The {{safety issues}} for {{cryogenic}} helium {{are similar to}} those of liquid nitrogen; its extremely low temperatures can result in cold burns, and the liquid-to-gas <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> can cause explosions if no pressure-relief devices are installed. Containers of helium gas at 5 to 10 K should be handled as if they contain liquid helium due to the rapid and significant thermal expansion that occurs when helium gas at less than 10 K is warmed to room temperature.|$|E

40|$|Hydraulic jump {{formed in}} {{abruptly}} expanding channels was experimentally studied. The study includes both horizontal and slopping channels. S-jump formed at different <b>expansion</b> <b>ratios</b> was studied under different flow conditions. Jump characteristics include sequent depth ratio, jump length ratio, and efficiency. Results {{show that the}} S-jump has a less sequent depth ratio compared to the classical jump and almost a similar jump length at high <b>expansion</b> <b>ratios.</b> Also the S-jump is more efficient compared to the classical jump and efficiency increases with the decrease of the <b>expansion</b> <b>ratios.</b> Prediction models for computing the jump characteristics have been presented. The sequent depth ratio prediction model has a simple format similar to the well-known Belanger equation "Chow [1]" for classical jump with modified Froude number. The modified Froude number includes abrupt expansion and bed slope effects. Experimental data from other sources are used to calibrate and verify the developed model. Prediction models for other jump characteristics show good agreement with the present and published data...|$|R

The experimental results obtained in this simple geometry provide useful data for benchmarking purposes in complex three-dimensional flows. Visualizations {{of the flow}} patterns were performed using streak photography, the velocity field of the flow was measured in detail using particle image velocimetry and additionally, pressure drop measurements were carried out. The Newtonian fluid flow was investigated for the <b>expansion</b> <b>ratios</b> of 1 : 2. 4, 1 : 4 and 1 : 8 and the experimental results were compared with numerical predictions. For all <b>expansion</b> <b>ratios</b> studied, a corner vortex is observed downstream of the expansion and an increase of the flow inertia leads to an enhancement of the vortex size. Good agreement is found between experimental and numerical results. The flow of the two non-Newtonian fluids was investigated experimentally for <b>expansion</b> <b>ratios</b> of 1 : 2. 4, 1 : 4, 1 : 8 and 1 : 12, and compared with numerical simulations using the Oldroyd-B, FENE-MCR and sPTT constitutive equations. For both the Boger and shear-thinning viscoelastic fluids, a corner vortex appears downstream of the expansion, which decreases in size and strength when the elasticity of the flow is increased. For all fluids and <b>expansion</b> <b>ratios</b> studied, the recirculations that are formed downstream of the square–square expansion exhibit a three-dimensional structure evidenced by a helical flow, which is also predicted in the numerical simulations...|$|R

25|$|A high-octane-rated fuel, such as {{liquefied}} {{petroleum gas}} (LPG) has an overall lower power output at the typical 10:1 compression ratio of an engine design optimized for gasoline fuel. An engine tuned for LPG fuel via higher compression ratios (typically 12:1) improves the power output. This is because higher-octane fuels allow for a higher compression ratio without knocking, resulting in a higher cylinder temperature, which improves efficiency. Also, increased mechanical efficiency is created by a higher compression ratio through the concomitant higher <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> on the power stroke, which {{is by far the}} greater effect. The higher <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> extracts more work from the high-pressure gas created by the combustion process. An Atkinson cycle engine uses the timing of the valve events to produce the benefits of a high <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> without the disadvantages, chiefly detonation, of a high compression ratio. A high <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> {{is also one of the}} two key reasons for the efficiency of diesel engines, along with the elimination of pumping losses due to throttling of the intake air flow.|$|E

The RS-25 nozzle has an unusually large <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> (about 77.5:1) for the chamber pressure. At sea level, a nozzle of this ratio would normally undergo flow separation of the jet from the nozzle, which would cause control difficulties and could even mechanically damage the vehicle. However, to aid the engine's operation [...] Rocketdyne engineers varied the angle of the nozzle walls from the theoretical optimum for thrust, reducing it near the exit.

The inner surface of each nozzle is cooled by liquid hydrogen flowing through brazed stainless steel tube wall coolant passages.

The RX 450h features an upgraded 3.5L 2GR-FXE V6 engine (shared with the RX 350) which produces [...] at 6000 rpm, along with a new inverter which boosts total horsepower to [...] (with the electric motors providing an added [...] ). The new inverter is 8kg lighter, and more efficient. Up to three electric motors {{are used in the}} hybrid system, including two dual motors for the forward wheels (123kW output), and a third for the rear wheels on the AWD model (50kW; engages when slippage is detected or the throttle pressed firmly). The RX 450h's V6 engine now runs on the Atkinson cycle for added efficiency. Compared to the prior Otto cycle system, the Atkinson cycle has a lower compression ratio, along with higher <b>expansion</b> <b>ratio</b> inside engine cylinders. This system uses less energy to form fuel-air mixtures, and releases more energy. A lighter, more free-flowing oil (0W-20) is also used, reducing friction energy loss and oil pump power requirements. Two additional systems are added to the RX 450h's Lexus Hybrid Drive powertrain, an exhaust heat recovery system to reduce engine warm-up periods (optimizing engine start-stop times, particularly in cold conditions), and a cooled exhaust gas-recirculation system to reduce fuel pumping loss. The electric motors use the first automotive application of liquid cooling {{on both sides of the}} high-current transistors, allowing greater contribution from the electric motors versus the gasoline engine.|$|E
