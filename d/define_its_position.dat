Some kinds of fish, when caught in the waters off Virginia and the Carolinas, are excellent for the table; but the same species, when taken off the warm coral banks of the Bahamas, are scarcely worth eating. In fact, we see no reason for doubting that when these fish find their health giving way in the warm regions of the south, they seek to reinvigorate themselves by change of water; and, quitting for a time the beauteous coral groves, spend a few of the sunnier months of each year in gambolling in the cool regions of the north, or, what is much the same thing, in those cool currents that flow from the north in clearly defined channels.|$|E

At the time their book was written, theories that explained hippocampal function did not sufficiently account for all the experimental findings, and their notion that the hippocampus processed spatiul memories appeared to be more consistent with the available data.

40|$|The Gemini {{primary mirror}} support {{incorporates}} {{a system of}} hydraulic whiffletrees to carry the mirror weight and <b>define</b> <b>its</b> <b>position.</b> The six orthogonal kinematic degrees of freedom are controlled by six hydraulic zones [...] three axial, two lateral, plus a transverse lateral. By varying the fluid volumes in these hydraulic zones the mirror position can be adjusted in all six degrees of freedom. Because of the finite lengths of the linkages that connect the mirror to the lateral supports, any shift in mirror position changes the amplitudes and directions of the applied forces with a resulting effect on the static balance and mirror figure. These effects have been calculated for mirror translations and rotations in all six degrees of freedom, resulting in predictions {{of the changes in}} the axial and lateral support forces and in the mirror figure. This paper describes the modeling as well as experimental verification of the results. Key words: lateral support, support force optimization, mirror figure, optical alignment, large telescopes 1...|$|E

The new leaves grown showed recovery of chlorophyll a parameters, increase in blade thickness, elongation of the palisade and spongy parenchymas, higher water content, and reduction of specific leaf area. These changes were associated with the osmoprotector of sucrose and antioxidative of raffinose effects, which indicate an efficient adjustment system to intense irradiance in the resistance phase of stress. However, the continuous decrease in photosynthetic pigments in the resistance phase combined with the photodamage in the fluorescence of Chl a and total abscission of leaves in the alarm phase are strong indications that C. echinata is a shade and late or climax species in forest succession...|$|E

In this study, the atypical pestivirus Th/ 04 _KhonKaen was recovered from serum of a naturally infected calf and the complete genome sequence was determined and analysed, as means to <b>define</b> <b>its</b> <b>position.</b> The viral genome is 12 337 nucleotides (nt) long, and comprises a 5 ′ UTR of 383 nt, a 3 ′ UTR of 254 nt and an open reading frame of 11700 nt, without duplication of viral sequences or insertions of cellular sequences. The phylogenetic analyses of the full-length sequence, performed by Neighbor-joining, maximum likelihood, and the Bayesian approach, unanimously placed Th/ 04 _KhonKaen in a single lineage, distinct from the established pestivirus species, and close to bovine viral diarrhea virus types 1 and 2. Furthermore, Th/ 04 _KhonKaen and two previously reported atypical pestiviruses D 32 / 00 _‘HoBi' and CH-KaHo/cont formed a well-supported monophyletic clade in trees based on the complete N and E 2 gene regions.
