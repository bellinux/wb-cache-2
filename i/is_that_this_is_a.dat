500|$|In an {{interview}} with Rotten Tomatoes, Gosling was asked what had attracted him to the film, and whether he had read the script at the time Jackman and director Neil Marshall were attached to it. He replied: I think {{that might be the}} original one I read. I read a few drafts. I read one as well where he wasn't a stunt driver at all, which was a newer draft [...] maybe that's the one Hugh Jackman had; I'm not sure exactly. Basically when I read it, in {{trying to figure out who}} would do something like this, the only way to make sense of this <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> guy that's seen too many movies, and he's started to confuse his life for a film. He's lost in the mythology of Hollywood and he's become an amalgamation of all the characters that he admires. [...] When Ryan Gosling signed on for the leading role, he was allowed to choose the director, a first in his career. A fan of his work, the actor chose the Danish filmmaker Nicolas Winding Refn. [...] "It had to be [...] There was no other choice." ...|$|E

2500|$|In February 2016, Black was the 'castaway' on Desert Island Discs. When {{asked about}} the Prime Minister's idea she sounded lukewarm, saying the real {{question}} was: [...] "How do you trigger the right response in people? Because lecturing people, bashing them on the head - on the whole, we know - doesn't get us there". Kirsty Young, the presenter, suggested that Black was [...] "somebody who might think that a simplistic political soundbite isn't even beginning to address the underlying issues of, culturally, what we're finding such a problem right now". Black replied: [...] "What I would say <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> hugely complex problem and not one thing alone will ever solve it".|$|E

When I cite those numbers to people here in the United States, I find most people are astonished. They just have no idea about that. In some countries in Africa, it's well above 50 percent that are women and girls. In many cases this is driven by cultural factors, where young girls are having sex with older men and [...] coerced to do that, where women aren't regarded as equal citizens with men. So {{there are lots of things}} that need to be done addressing those kinds of cultural issues also.|$|E
2500|$|Dr. Esam Omeish, former President of the MAS, is {{a member}} of the Board. [...] In 2004 Omeish, at 36 then the {{youngest}} member of the mosque's Board, said there is [...] "no question" [...] that the mosque leadership needs to be more open and inclusive of younger people, including women. [...] "The bottom line <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> mosque that is in the heart of Washington," [...] he said. [...] "Our goal is to make the congregation reflect that reality." [...] Omeish acknowledged that some mosque members raised acceptable questions about the mosque's constitution, and that proposals under consideration in 2004 included direct elections to the mosque's board of directors, director term limits, and phasing out the board seats that the constitution assigns to officials of certain Muslim organizations.|$|E
2500|$|Twelve {{actors have}} headlined the series as the Doctor. The {{transition}} from one actor to another is {{written into the}} plot of the show with the concept of regeneration into a new incarnation – an idea introduced in 1966 to allow the show to continue after the departure of original lead William Hartnell who was becoming very ill at the time. The concept <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> Time Lord trait through which the character of the Doctor takes on a new body and personality to recover from a severe injury or anything that would otherwise kill a normal person. Each actor's portrayal differs, but all represent stages {{in the life of the}} same character and form a single narrative. The time-travelling feature of the plot means that different incarnations of the Doctor occasionally meet. The current lead, Peter Capaldi, confirmed he would be leaving the show after the tenth series, with his final appearance being the 2017 Christmas special, [...] "Twice Upon a Time". In July, Jodie Whittaker was announced as the Thirteenth Doctor, the first woman to be cast in the role.|$|E

2500|$|Senior Human Rights Watch adviser Alison Des Forges {{said the}} lack of legal {{representation}} was a serious concern. [...] "The authorities' view <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> quasi-customary kind of procedure, and there never used to be lawyers, so there's no need for lawyers now. The {{problem with that is}} that little is the same except for the name. In this system, there is considerable weight given to the official side. The office of the prosecutor provides considerable assistance to the bench [...] in terms of making its determination, so you no longer have a level playing field." [...] There may, however, be no alternative to the Gacaca trials, she added. [...] "Obviously the problem of delivering justice after the genocide is an overwhelming problem. Gacaca may not be ideal but there is at this point no alternative.... The official explanation I think is that people did not speak openly until the Gacaca process and now many more accusations are surfacing. Also, the concession program, which requires the naming of all those who participated along with the accused , has led to a multiplication of names. [...] "How many of these are well-founded, what is the credibility of the evidence, these are very serious concerns." ...|$|E
2500|$|In Congress, Barr {{became famous}} for his [...] "dour" [...] image and told constituents, [...] "You don't send me to Washington to smile." [...] He also said in a radio {{interview}} [...] "If it's not in the Constitution, I won't smile". He later explained [...] "I don't consider politicians who smile to be worth {{a heck of a}} lot... all things considered, it doesn't make a dime's worth of difference if the politicians in Washington smile or not, what matters is how much of your hard-earned dollars they take to spend in pure pork". Barr said in 2010 [...] "I can see a situation where the federal government is going to bring an entire suitcase of San Francisco values to the American family, and while I would love to explain all the things that are wrong with that, the fact <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> corrupting, left-leaning, influence on a section of society that so many liberal elites want to see taken out of the 'red state' column. The only solution to this kind of behavior is dour and austere social conservatism, like my own". Adding to his image, Barr has frequently protested about [...] "cult hairstyles", saying [...] "I cannot abide by people who adopt a cult hairstyle, or persistently dress inappropriately for meetings with me".|$|E

6000|$|... 2. The {{second thing}} that I {{take notice of}} from these words <b>is,</b> <b>That</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> {{dispensation}} and manifestation of Gods anger against a man for his sin. When God is angry with men, I mean, when he is so angry with them, this among many {{is one of the}} Judgments that he giveth them up unto, to wit, to blindness of mind, and hardness of heart, which he also suffereth to accompany them till they enter in at the gates of death. And then, and there, and not short of then and there, their eyes come to be opened. Hence it is said of the rich man mentioned in Luke, He dyed, and in Hell he lifted up his eyes: {174a} Implying that he did not lift them up before: He neither saw what he had done, nor whither he was going, till he came to the place of execution, even into Hell. He died asleep in his soul; he dyed bespotted, stupified, and so consequently for quietness, like a Child or Lamb, even as Mr. Badman did: this was a sign of Gods anger; he had a mind to damn him for his sins, and therefore would not let him see nor have an heart to repent for them, lest he should convert, and his damnation, which God had appointed, should be frustrate: lest they should be converted, and I should heal them.|$|E
60|$|A {{very common}} mode of aerating bread in America {{is by the}} {{effervescence}} of an acid and an alkali in the flour. The carbonic acid gas thus formed produces minute air-cells in the bread, or, as the cook says, makes it light. When this process is performed with exact attention to chemical laws, so that the acid and alkali completely neutralize each other, leaving no overplus of either, the result is often very palatable. The difficulty <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> happy conjunction of circumstances which seldom occurs. The acid most commonly employed is that of sour milk, and, as milk has many degrees of sourness, the rule of a certain quantity of alkali to the pint must necessarily produce very different results at different times. As an actual fact, where this mode of making bread prevails, as we lament to say it does {{to a great extent}} in this country, one finds five cases of failure to one of success. It is a woful thing that the daughters of New England have abandoned the old respectable mode of yeast brewing and bread raising for this specious substitute, so easily made, and so seldom well made. The green, clammy, acrid substance called biscuit, which many of our worthy republicans are obliged to eat in these days, is wholly unworthy {{of the men and women}} of the Republic. Good patriots ought not to be put off in that way,--they deserve better fare.|$|E
6000|$|A {{hypothetical}} proposition is not, {{like the}} pretended complex propositions which we previously considered, a mere aggregation of simple propositions. The simple propositions which {{form part of}} the words {{in which it is}} couched, form no part of the assertion which it conveys. When we say, If the Koran comes from God, Mohammed is the prophet of God, we do not intend to affirm either that the Koran does come from God, or that Mohammed is really his prophet. Neither of these simple propositions may be true, and yet the truth of the hypothetical proposition may be indisputable. What is asserted is not the truth of either of the propositions, but the inferribility of the one from the other. What, then, is the subject, and what the predicate of the hypothetical proposition? “The Koran” is not the subject of it, nor is “Mohammed:” for nothing is affirmed or denied either of the Koran or of Mohammed. The real subject of the predication is the entire proposition, “Mohammed is the prophet of God;” and the affirmation <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> <b>is</b> <b>a</b> legitimate inference from the proposition, “The Koran comes from God.” The subject and predicate, therefore, of a hypothetical proposition are names of propositions. The subject is some one proposition. The predicate is a general relative name applicable to propositions; of this form—“an inference from so and so.” A fresh instance is here afforded of the remark, that particles are abbreviations; since “If A is B, C is D,” is found to be an abbreviation of the following: “The proposition C is D, is a legitimate inference from the proposition A is B.” ...|$|E

30|$|Why do the {{textbook}} introduce near synonyms without differentiating them?
