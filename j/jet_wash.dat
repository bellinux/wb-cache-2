This study describes the effects of spray <b>jet</b> <b>washing</b> under various processing conditions to shell surface counts of Salmonella {{and the presence of}} bacteria in egg contents. Experiments used eggs that were contaminated with Salmonella Enteritidis PT 4 or Salmonella Typhimurium DT 104 before cuticle hardening. Washing of contaminated eggs under optimum conditions resulted in a more than 5 -log reduction of Salmonella counts from the shell surface. Salmonella was not isolated from the yolk or albumen of any egg washed by the optimal protocol, suggesting that when properly controlled, egg washing did not cause Salmonella to enter the contents. However, contamination did arise if strict control was not maintained over the wash and rinse water temperatures. Both Salmonella Enteritidis and Salmonella Typhimurium were shown to enter the egg contents when water temperatures were lowered, indicating that strict temperature control must be maintained in order to prevent the ingress of Salmonella into egg contents. Other washing machine parameters that were investigated did not signi cantly affect Salmonella entry into the egg contents but in uenced shell surface kill levels to varying degrees.

50|$|Pests and {{diseases}} of African nightshade {{are similar to}} those of Solanaceae family and include aphids, spider mites, and early blight. Aphids feed by sucking plant sap, causing the leaves to curl, which is unattractive to customers, as well as a chance of drying out or death of the plant. Regular monitoring and spot spraying with biopesticides, when necessary, can help reduce infestations. The feeding of spider mites may cause a decrease in plant growth, flowering, and number of berries and seeds. Avoiding particular pyrethroids may help reduce the occurrence of spider mite outbreaks. Overhead irrigation or strong <b>jet</b> <b>wash</b> plants can knock off spider mites and destroy their webs. Early blight causes brown leaf spots, up to 1 cm in diameter in a circular pattern. It often occurs under warm conditions, beginning on the oldest leaves, making its way up the plant. You can avoid early blight by rotating with other crops like amaranth, but not other vegetables of the same family, which are susceptible to the same diseases.|$|E
40|$|A {{numerical}} finite-difference model, derived using a control-volume approach, is used {{to compute}} the flow and heat transfer characteristics of a confined laminar air jet impinging on an isothermal surface. Four cases are considered, with Re = 250, 500, 650 and 750, and nozzle-to-plate spacing, H/W = 5. At Re = 250, the boundary layer developing on the target plate separates. At Re = 500, the boundary layer develops without separation off the target wall, the jet momentum is sufficient to overcome the adverse outer field and wall effects. The flow is symmetric at these Reynolds numbers, and maximum values for pressure, friction and heat transfer coefficients occur at the stagnation point. The flow at Re = 650 displays asymmetry as the jet buckles, both flow and heat transfer indicate a transition to an unsteady regime. The critical Reynolds number for the onset of unsteady flow is between 585 and 610. When Re is further increased to 750, the jet "buckles" severely and vortices are shed in the high shear regions. The spectral distribution of the velocity in the jet streamwise and spanwise directions at three distinct locations in the jet, point out three dominant frequencies. The lowest frequency, at 3. 66 Hz, {{is associated with the}} jet "sweeping" the wall, identified as the "flapping" motion. The highest frequency, 12. 96 Hz, is related to the "buckling" motion of the jet at the frequency at which vortices are formed in the jet shear layer. As a result of the two combined unsteady modes, the peak heat transfer is enhanced and the lateral extent of the effective cooling is broadened. A distinct demarcation in time averaged Nusselt number was observed between the steady behavior for Re 600. The jet subjected to twenty-four types of forcing reveals two cases relevant in terms of flow and heat transfer control. The out-of-phase forcing at the dominant frequency of 10. 68 Hz, Re = 650, stabilizes one side of the confined impinging jet. This results in an enhanced wall heat transfer and peculiar behavior of the hydrodynamic field. When forcing out-of-phase at a dominant frequency of 12. 96 Hz, Re = 75 0, the jet is stabilized completely. The forcing suppresses the high-amplitude low-frequency "flapping" jet motion, and the jet tip displacement on the target wall captures only the high-frequency low-amplitude oscillatory motion of the jet. The suppression of the jet "flapping" motion leads to a smaller "patch" heat transfer coefficient. However, since the <b>jet</b> <b>washes</b> the target wall without separation, the wall-averaged heat transfer is much higher than the unforced cases. For the out-of-phase forcing at 12. 96 Hz, the "patch" heat transfer is 24 % lower than the unforced case, while the wall-averaged heat transfer is 35 % higher...|$|R
40|$|The main {{objective}} of this work was to analyze the perception of quality in the milk production chain among farmers and the industry in a cooperative located at the north of Rio Grande do Sul state (Cooproleite). The mandatory milk production patterns at the farming level were identified based on the official government document â€œIN 51 â€. Then, the variations between expectations and perception related to those patterns were analyzed at the farming and industry levels. The research method used was the case study, which consisted of 514 active producing members of the cooperative, from which a random probability sample of 54 producers was extracted, and the 2 industries with which these producers market their product. The results show that milk production at the farmer level does not meet both their own expectations and the industry’s. The lower perception scores among the farmers were related to brucellosis and tuberculosis control, feed and milk cooling.

30|$|The Great East Japan Earthquake that {{occurred}} on March 11, 2011 {{resulted in the}} explosion of the TEPCO Fukushima 1 st Nuclear Power Plant and the global dispersion of a large quantity of radioactive substances. A high radiation dose was particularly recorded in Fukushima prefecture several weeks after the accident, although the level is presently sufficiently low. However, considering that the adverse effects of low but extended exposure to radiation are yet to be negated, there is the urgent need for further decontamination. In our study, we focused on the efficient decontamination of radioactive substances in residential areas, for which we propose a high-pressure water <b>jet</b> system for <b>washing</b> road surfaces. The system differs from conventional systems of its type that were initially designed for use in the immediate environment of the nuclear reactors of the TEPCO Fukushima 1 st Nuclear Power Plant. The proposed system consists of multiple washing, transporter, and server robots. The washing robots decontaminate the road surface using high-pressure water jets and are transported between washed and unwashed areas by the transporter robots. The server robots supply the water used for washing and absorb the polluted water together with ground dust. In this paper, we describe the concept of the system and present the results of decontamination experiments. Particular attention is given to the washing robot and its mechanism and control method. The results of the integration of the washing robot in an experimental system confirmed the feasibility of the proposed system.|$|R
40|$|AbstractObjectives. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{describe}} the echocar-diographic appearance of the normal CarboMedics prosthesis in the aortic and mitral positions. Background. Echocardiography is the standard method of assessing prosthetic valves. However, new valve designs may still be marketed without an accompanying echocardiographic description. The CarboMedics prosthesis is in widespread use, but few noninvasive hemodynamic data have been published. Methods. Echocardiography was performed in 147 patients with a total of 96 normally functioning CarboMedics prostheses in the aortic position and 75 in the mitral position; in 24 patients, valves were implanted in both positions. The following variables were measured: peak and mean transvalvular velocities, peak and mean instantaneous gradient estimated from the modified Bernoulli equation, aortic acceleration slope, pressure half-time, transvalvular flow and effective orifice area using the continuity equation. Patterns of regurgitation were observed by trans-thoracic study in an valves and by transesophageal study in selected mitral valve prostheses. Results. For the aortic valve prostheses, estimated mean gradient ranged between 6 and 19 mm Hg. Effective area differed markedly among the anulus diameters (p < 0. 001), with a mean value of 1 cm 2 for the 19 -mm valve and 2. 6 cm 2 for the 29 -mm valve. For the mitral valve prostheses, mean gradient ranged from 3 to 7 mm Hg. There were a total of four washing leaks, one on either side of each pivotal point, and these lasted throughout systole or diastole. One jet was commonly more prominent than the other three. Conclusions. The CarboMedics prosthesis offered relatively little resistance to forward flow except at small anulus diameters.

40|$|The {{stability}} of stones in propeller-induced <b>jet</b> <b>wash</b> is still difficult to predict. Especially {{the trend of}} bowthrusters increasing in size and power in sea going ships (especially ferries) {{over the last years}} may be a reason for concern when dealing with the protection of slopes and beds. But also ships used in inland navigation are using bowthrusters more intensively. Because of high costs of crew, many inland navigation ships try to sail with a minimum of crew. In order to allow mooring with a limited number of staff, the manoeuvrability of the ship has to be improved, which is often done by making a bowthruster in the ship. At this moment near mooring dolphins in the navigable rivers of the Netherlands managers are confronted with damage to the slope protection because of heavy use of bowthrusters. From these the conclusion can be drawn {{that it is necessary to}} improve design formulas for the effect of a bowthruster, as also suggested by Römisch and Hering (2002). The second step is then to make a conceptual model of the effect of (propeller-induced) turbulence on the {{stability of}} the slope, followed by a systematic set of tests in the lab in order to verify the conceptual model and in order to determine the calibration constants in the conceptual model.
