40|$|The polar semiannual {{oscillation}} in zonal wind {{can explain}} midwinter {{weakening of the}} polar vortex and the relatively short stratospheric and mesospheric summar easterlies. The phase of the wind oscillation is equinoctial, as is the phase of the semiannual component in magnetic storm activity. For a given altitude, the contours of amplitude of the semiannual wind oscillation have less variability in geomagnetic than in geographic coordinates. It is suggested that polar wind oscillations are caused by the semiannual maxima in magnetic storm activity which lead to electron dissociation of O 2 into O, in turn increasing ozone more rapidly than the dissociation of N 2 destroys ozone, and thereby inducing a semiannual variation in the thermal and wind fields. This implies that <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>processes</b> may cause or affect the development of sudden warmings.

40|$|The {{concept for}} Ravens {{satellite}} mission was proposed {{in response to}} a CSA AO for potential Canadian mission contributions to the International Living With a Star (ILWS) program. Ravens was conceived of to fill an important gap in the ILWS program: global imaging. Ravens will build on the heritage of world-class global imaging carried out in Canada. It would do much more than provide global observations to complete the system level capabilities of ILWS. Ravens would be comprised of two satellites on elliptical polar orbits, relatively phased on those orbits to provide the first-ever continuous (ie., 24 hours per day 7 days per week) global imaging of the northern hemisphere auroral and polar cap regions.

We also note that while we believe the features presented in this paper reflect mostly the spatial structure of the external source, also localization of the fields enhancements due to the lateral inhomogeneities in the ground conductivity structures, such as at coastal areas, need improved quantification for GIC purposes (e.g., Pirjola 2013; Thomson et al. 2005).

It {{is worth noting that}} we also study active but non-HILDCAA intervals. Examining the geomagnetic AE index, we apply a dynamics analysis composed of the phase space, the recurrence plot (RP), and the recurrence quantification analysis (RQA) methods. As a result, the quantification finds two distinct clusterings of the dynamical behaviours occurring in the interplanetary medium: one regarding a geomagnetically quiet condition regime and the other regarding an interplanetary activity regime. Furthermore, the HILDCAAs seem unique events regarding a visible, intense manifestations of interplanetary Alfvénic waves; however, they are similar to the other kinds of conditions regarding a dynamical signature (based on RQA), because it is involved in the same complex mechanism of generating geomagnetic disturbances. Also, by characterizing the proper conditions of transitions from quiescent conditions to weaker geomagnetic disturbances inside the magnetosphere and ionosphere system, the RQA method indicates clearly the two fundamental dynamics (geomagnetically quiet intervals and HILDCAA events) to be evaluated with magneto-hydrodynamics simulations to understand better the critical processes related to energy and particle transfer into the magnetosphere–ionosphere system.

Major features of the experimental winds, such as the mean day to night circulation caused by solar u. v. and e. u. v. heating, augmented by magnetospheric processes at high latitude and the sharp boundaries and flow reversals imposed on thermospheric winds by momentum transfer (ion drag) from the magnetosphere, are qualitatively explained by a version of the global model using a semi-empirical global model of polar electric fields (Volland Model 2 or Heppner Model A) and a model of global electron density which excludes the effects of high-latitude <b>geomagnetic</b> <b>processes.</b> A second version of the global dynamic model includes a theoretical model of the high-latitude ionosphere which is self-consistent and reflects the enhancement of ionization due to magnetospheric phenomena acting in addition to solar e. u. v. photo-ionization, including the interactive processes which occur between ionization and high latitude ion convection and thermospheric winds.

Accurate dating remains critical to making inferences about timing and structure of reversals and excursions. Controversy remains about the significance of such features as the preferred longitudinal paths that virtual geomagnetic poles at some sites seem to follow during excursions and reversals.

Correlations are sought between reversal rates and other properties of the paleomagnetic secular variation, and more general models for reversals and secular variations are being developed to provide predictions of the power spectrum of geomagnetic intensity variations for comparison with those derived from long paleomagnetic records.

40|$|International audienceThe {{presence}} or absence of orbital frequencies in the palaeomagnetic field spectrum is the subject of intense discussions. While palaeoclimatic variations, i. e. glacial/interglacial alternation periods, are known to be governed by insolation variations via orbital frequencies, the link between such frequencies and the <b>geomagnetic</b> field maintenance <b>processes</b> (convection and rotation in the fluid metallic core) remains unclear. The study of frequency behaviour of long time-series proxy records requires a robust and linear time-frequency method with local and scale analysis properties. For these reasons, we use algorithms based on complex continuous wavelet theory and the stationary phase method, first developed in acoustics in the years 1988 - 1991, for extracting frequency and amplitude modulation laws of arbitrary signals from the phase of their wavelet transform. This method is robust in the presence of noise and does not require restrictive conditions on the energy of signals. After introducing the basis of the method with some illustrations on periodic signals, we show the efficiency of our algorithms on a synthetic insolation signal (Milankovitch cycles), by extracting the main three orbital frequencies (precession, obliquity and eccentricity); then we show its robustness {{in the presence of a}} high level of noise. Finally, we apply this method to various proxy records of (i) past climate variations (δ 18 O), (ii) the past geomagnetic field intensity variations recorded by ocean sediments and (iii) along the deep-seafloor basalts and (iv) variations of the production of cosmogenic nuclide (10 Be/ 9 Be).

As a result of this work, {{it will be possible to}} use lightning activity data sets to estimate globally induced precipitation flux rates and thus determine the lightning-induced effect on the radiation belts more accurately. Four study days were selected, during which a high proportion of the lightning activity occurring near the east coast of North America produced observable Trimpi effects on VLF transmitter signals propagating in the region of the Antarctic Peninsula (similar toL = 2 - 2. 5). The lack of lightning in Antarctica gives this location a unique advantage for this study. The functional dependence of the relative scattered field amplitude with the return stroke peak current of the lightning discharge suggests that during these events diffusion conditions are occurring near the precipitating radiation belt particles loss cone due to strong whistler wave fields, probably caused by ducted signals. The range of observed Trimpi scatter amplitude of - 10 to - 35 dB was produced by precipitation bursts with energy fluxes estimated to range over 6. 5 - 0. 4 x 10 (- 3) ergs cm(- 2) s(- 1). The largest fluxes were found to be driven by lightning currents of about 250 kA, while the smallest detectable fluxes relate to lightning currents of 70 kA.

In this paper we discuss an adaptive filter which is based on linear prediction. The coefficients for the linear predictor (LP) are dynamically refreshed and calculated in the embedded NIOS processor, which is implemented in the same FPGA chip. The Levinson recursion, used to obtain the filter coefficients, is also implemented in the NIOS and is partially supported by direct multiplication in the DSP blocks of the logic FPGA segment. Tests confirm that the LP can be an alternative to other methods involving multiple time-to-frequency domain conversions using an FFT procedure. These multiple conversions draw heavily on the power consumption of the FPGA and are avoided by the linear prediction approach. Minimization of the power consumption is an important issue because the final system will be powered by solar panels. The FIR filter has been successfully tested in the Altera development kits with the EP 4 CE 115 F 29 C 7 from the Cyclone IV family and the EP 3 C 120 F 780 C 7 from the Cyclone III family at a 170 MHz sampling rate, a 12 -bit I/O resolution, and an internal 30 -bit dynamic range. Most of the slow floating-point NIOS calculations have been moved to the FPGA logic segments as extended fixed-point operations, which significantly reduced the refreshing time of the coefficients used in the LP. We conclude that the LP is a viable alter-native to other methods such as non-adaptive methods involving digital notch filters or multiple time-to-frequency domain conversions using an FFT procedure. ...|$|R
