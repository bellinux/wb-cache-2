This is the first attempt to estimate seabird <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> of Taiwan longline fisheries in this area. To collect scientific information for target species as well as <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> species, Taiwan has launched observer programs since 2002. There were 35 observer trips from 2002 to 2006. The coverage rate was 5. 33 %. The observed days were 4755. According to the data collected, the seabird <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> rate (BPUE) in each 5 * 5 degree grid square varied from 0 to 0. 2266 per 1000 hooks with the average BPUE of 0. 0075 per 1000 hooks. As for the seabird <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> distribution, the BPUE were highest in the areas between 35 - 45 ﾟS and 35 - 45 ﾟW and between 30 ﾟ- 40 ﾟS and 5 ﾟ- 15 ﾟW.

In the Eastern Tropical Pacific (ETP), a region of high fishing activity, olive ridley (Lepidochelis olivacea) and other sea turtles are accidentally caught in fishing nets with tuna and other animals. To date, the interaction between fishing activity, ocean conditions and sea turtle <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> in the ETP has been described and quantified, but the factors leading to the interaction of olive ridleys and fishing activity are not well understood. This information is essential for the development of future management strategies that avoid bycatch and incidental captures of sea turtles. We used Generalized additive models (GAM) to analyze the relationship between olive ridley <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> per unit effort (iCPUE) in the ETP purse-seine fisheries and environmental conditions, geographic extent and fishing set type (associated with dolphins, floating objects or in free-swimming tuna schools). Our results suggest that water temperature, set type and geographic location (latitude, longitude and distance to nesting beaches) are the most important predictor variables to describe the probability of a capture event, with the highest iCPUE observed in sets made over floating objects. With the environmental predictors used, sea surface temperatures (SST) of 26 – 30 °C and chlorophyll-a (chl-a) concentrations < 0. 36 mg m⁻³ were associated with the highest probability of an <b>incidental</b> <b>catch.</b> Temporally, the highest probability of an <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> was observed {{in the second half of}} the year (June to December).

40|$|Small cetaceans, such as harbour porpoises, {{often become}} {{entangled}} in gillnets, and this anthropogenic mortality is a conservation concern.

Fisheries studied included those targeting Atlantic cod, lumpfish, Atlantic herring, monkfish, white hake, Greenland halibut, redfish and winter flounder. [...] A methodology was developed to estimate <b>incidental</b> <b>catch,</b> based on datasets currently available within the Department of Fisheries and Oceans. Confidence intervals were generated using resampling statistics, allowing an assessment of uncertainty surrounding these estimates. Despite reductions in fishing effort since 1992, an estimated average of 1, 516 harbour porpoises were captured in various Newfoundland and Labrador gillnet fisheries annually between 2001 and 2003. Most captures occurred in nearshore fisheries for Atlantic cod and lumpfish. Several dolphin species were also captured in smaller numbers, mostly in the offshore monkfish fishery. The impact of this mortality on the population of harbour porpoise and other small cetaceans cannot be assessed until population estimates become available. [...] Using the same methodology, <b>incidental</b> <b>catch</b> assessments were compiled for numerous species of pinnipeds, seabirds, sharks and bony fish that had been reported as <b>incidental</b> <b>catch.</b> For most species, insufficient information exists {{to assess the impact}} of this mortality.

Commercial Atlantic herring bottom trawl vessels assisted with field-based evaluation of alewife, blueback herring, and Atlantic herring species distribution forecast models.

Locations of expected low and high forecasted <b>incidental</b> <b>catches</b> were sampled, as well as locations the captain expected to find low and high <b>incidental</b> <b>catches.</b> This allowed us to sample within the spatial area the fishery occurs, and to evaluate the forecasted conditions, and predictions, at the spatial scale of the fishery.
