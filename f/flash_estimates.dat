40|$|Timely {{availability}} of relevant economic information {{is from the}} users ’ point of view a crucial pre-requirement for effective economic and monetary policy and for accurate analysis and reliable forecasting. Unfortunately, official statistics are not always able to meet such needs. For this reason, particularly over the recent past, advanced statistical and econometric techniques {{have been used to}} complement the classical production process in order to increase the timeliness of the relevant economic information. Furthermore, official statistics do not necessarily show explicitly relevant phenomena such as the cyclical situation and the location of turning points. In order to fill this gap, indicators have to be built up to extract such relevant signals and to make them available in an easily readable and comprehensible way to all users. This paper gives a general overview of ongoing Eurostat projects, aiming to supply timely information to all users based on transparent and statistically sound methodologies. In particular this paper presents results related to the construction of <b>flash</b> <b>estimates</b> in order to increase the timeliness of official statistics as well as the construction of a timely statistical system for business cycle analysis based on a set of turning points indicators and cyclical estimates.

Do the first estimates have the same directional signs as the later numbers? Are the original numbers unbiased estimates of the later figures? Are any observed biases related to the state of the economy? Finally, we determine whether there is a significant difference between the vector of the 30 day estimates of the 10 major components and the vector of the 90 day estimates of the same components. We conclude that, despite the existence of some bias, under most circumstances, an analyst could use the early data to obtain a realistic picture of what had happened in the economy in the previous quarter. <b>Flash</b> <b>Estimates,</b> Data Revisions, GDP Components, Statistical Tests, Business Cycles...|$|E

Thus, we address nowcasting when location shifts occur, probably with measurement errors in the recent data. We describe impulse-indicator saturation as a potential solution to such shifts, noting its relation to intercept corrections and to robust methods to avoid systematic nowcast failure. We propose a nowcasting strategy, building models of all disaggregate series by automatic methods, forecasting all variables before the end of each period, testing for shifts as available measures arrive, and adjusting forecasts of cognate missing series if substantive discrepancies are found. An alternative is switching to robust forecasts when breaks are detected. We apply a variant of this strategy to nowcast UK GDP growth, seeking pseudo real-time data availability...|$|E

40|$|Lightning is an {{important}} natural source of nitrogen oxide especially {{in the middle and}} upper troposphere. Hence, it is essential to represent lightning in chemistry transport and coupled chemistry climate models. Using ERA-Interim meteorological reanalysis data we compare the lightning flash density distributions produced using several existing lightning parametrisations, as well as a new parametrisation developed on the basis of upward cloud ice flux at 440 hPa. The use of ice flux forms a link to the non-inductive charging mechanism of thunderstorms. Spatial and temporal distributions of lightning flash density are compared to tropical and subtropical observations for 2007 - 2011 from the Lightning Imaging Sensor (LIS) on the Tropical Rainfall Measuring Mission (TRMM) satellite. The well-used lightning flash parametrisation based on cloud-top height has large biases but the derived annual total flash density has a better spatial correlation with the LIS observations than other existing parametrisations. A comparison of flash density simulated by the different schemes shows that the cloud-top height parametrisation has many more instances of moderate flash densities and fewer low and high extremes compared to the other parametrisations. Other studies in the literature have shown that this feature of the cloud-top height parametrisation is in contrast to lightning observations over certain regions. Our new ice flux parametrisation shows a clear improvement over all the existing parametrisations with lower root mean square errors (RMSEs) and better spatial correlations with the observations for distributions of annual total, and seasonal and interannual variations. The greatest improvement with the new parametrisation is a more realistic representation of the zonal distribution with a better balance between tropical and subtropical lightning <b>flash</b> <b>estimates.</b> The new parametrisation is appropriate for testing in chemistry transport and chemistry climate models that use a lightning parametrisation...|$|E
40|$|In {{order for}} a policy to be effective, the links between the policy tools and the sub- sequent targets must be known, understandable, stable, and predictable. In this respect, this thesis is {{composed}} of three separate yet related empirical studies, that target important macroeconomic variables, which {{play a central role}} in the conduct of macroeconomic policies. First, simple regression estimates and a factor-based model are utilized to produce forecasts for Bahrain quarterly GDP growth using quarterly data-set that cover the period from 1995 : Q 1 to 2008 : Q 3. To do so, we run a simple regression model using a small data-set including six explanatory variables carefully selected based on in-sample correlation with the target variable. Alternatively, a factor model based on 65 indicators is employed to forecast Bahrain GDP growth. Using simulated out- of-sample experiments we assess and compare the performance of both approaches. The main finding from our forecasting experiment is that the best forecasting performance can be reached using simple regression estimates with a carefully selected small set of variables. In particular, by looking at point and density nowcasts, we find that a simple regression model that use industrial production as an indicator are more accurate than a static factor approach that uses over 65 variables. The official <b>flash</b> <b>estimates</b> of Bahrain quarterly GDP are published with a delay of 90 days after the end of the reference quarter. Our <b>flash</b> <b>estimates,</b> based on simple regression model, reduce the lag to 54 days. Second, we aim to forecast West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude oil prices using a large monthly data-set that cover the period from March 1983 to December 2011. To achieve this aim, forecasting with factor models offer a usual approach that utilizes large data-sets, however; a forecasting model which simply includes all factors in state space equation and do not allow for time varying may be not suitable with a highly volatile market such as oil market. To overcome these limitations, we employ an approach that accounts both for parameter and model uncertainty. In particular, we implement the the Dynamic Model Averaging (DMA) approach suggested by Koop and Korobilis (2012). The key element of the DMA approach is that it allows both for model and parameter to vary at each point of time. By doing so, the DMA is robust to structural breaks. Empirical findings show that DMA approach outperforms any other alternative model used in the forecasting literature. We show that there is model but not parameter variation. Finally, we find that the DMA approach provides a better proxy of expected spot prices than future prices. Third, the Johansen cointegration technique is used to examine the long-run relationship between oil consumption, nuclear energy consumption, oil price and economic growth for eight countries over the period from 1965 - 2010. The countries investigated are divided into two groups. The first group includes four industrialized countries: USA, Canada, Japan and France, while the second group includes four emerging economies: Russia, China, South Korea and India. Results suggest that there is a long-run relationship between the four variables. Exclusion tests show that at least one energy source enter the cointegration space significantly, which im- plies that energy a long-run impact on economic growth. The emerging economies found to be heavily dependent on both oil and nuclear energy consumption. We also examine the causal linkage between the variables through exogeneity test. There is evidence of a unidirectional causality between energy consumption (oil or nuclear) and economic growth in all investigated countries. Our findings have important pol- icy implications that should be taken into account in designing appropriate energy policies. Energy conservation policies might have drawbacks or damaging repercus- sions on economic growth for this group of countries. ...|$|E
40|$|We {{recorded}} the electroretinogram (ERG) from human subjects with normal vision, using ganzfeld stimulation {{in the presence}} of rod-suppressing blue background light. In families of responses to flashes of increasing intensity, we investigated features of both receptoral and post-receptoral origin. Firstly, we found that the oscillatory potentials (OPs, that have long been known to be post-receptoral) exhibited a time course that was invariant over a range of bright flash intensities. Secondly, we found that the photopic b-wave (which probably originates in cone ON bipolar cells) was most pronounced after test flashes of around 20 Td s, and could be suppressed either by increasing the test flash intensity or by applying a second flash after the test flash. We obtained estimates of the time course of the cone photoreceptor response using the paired-flash technique, in which an intense ‘probe’ flash was delivered at different times after a test flash. The response to the probe flash was recorded and, its amplitude was measured at early times after the probe <b>flash.</b> <b>Estimates</b> obtained in this way were of normalized amplitude, but could be scaled to an absolute amplitude by making an assumption about the level of probe-flash response that corresponded to complete suppression of photoreceptor current. For moderately bright test flashes the estimated cone photoreceptor response at early times coincided closely with the a-wave of the test flash ERG. However, the maximal size of this estimated response accounted for only about 70 % of the peak a-wave amplitude in the case of bright flashes, and for an even smaller proportion after flashes of lower intensity, and we take this to indicate the existence of a third substantial post-receptoral contribution to the a-wave. For dim flashes, the time-to-peak of the cone response was around 15 – 20 ms, and for saturating flashes the dominant time constant of recovery was about 18 ms. The intensity dependence of the estimated cone response amplitude at fixed times followed an exponential saturation relation. We provide a comparison between our estimates of photoreceptor responses from human cones, and recent estimates from monkey cones obtained using related ERG approaches, and earlier single-cell measurements from isolated primate cones...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} a short-term projection model for French economic activity, OPTIM, {{the aim of}} which is twofold. First it gives an early estimate of real GDP growth for the previous quarter, when no figure has yet been released by Insee, the French National Statistical Institute, along with <b>flash</b> <b>estimates</b> for main GDP components (consumption, investment, inventories and external trade) together with a breakdown by sectors (services, manufacturing, construction, equipment, agri-food). This appears particularly useful for the short-run analysis. In this respect OPTIM may {{be considered as a}} traditional bridge equation model since it links a particular indicator available generally ahead of the release of the quarterly national accounts with a quarterly aggregate like GDP, consumption…. Second, this tool supplies also estimates for GDP growth and its main components for the current quarter and for the next quarter (i. e two and three quarters respectively following the latest reference period of Insee's GDP data release). A pool of (mainly) monthly variables is used, which are, sometimes, directly introduced in the specification but, more often, summarised by the implementation of a principal component analysis (PCA). The largest part of the set of indicators comprises survey data together with monthly traditional indicators (industrial production, consumption in manufactured goods…). But other data (in particular financial data) are also introduced. The outcomes of OPTIM rely on a relatively complex procedure involving about twenty equations and mixing two alternative approaches: a supply approach consisting in a direct modelling of GDP and a demand approach where GDP is the sum of consumption, investment, changes in stocks and net trade (exports minus imports). The discrepancy between these two estimates is distributed according to an original method, yielding a unique GDP estimation. The paper is organised as follows. Section 1 presents the main features of OPTIM. Section 2 deals with data description while section 3 addresses the data assessment's issue. In section 4, the main equations are described. Section 5 presents a general assessment of OPTIM in terms of forecasting record. Finally section 6 concludes and proposes some avenues for further developments. ...|$|E
40|$|In recent years, {{thanks to}} {{developments}} in information technology, large-dimensional datasets have been increasingly available. Researchers now {{have access to}} thousands of economic series and {{the information contained in}} them can be used to create accurate forecasts and to test economic theories. To exploit this large amount of information, researchers and policymakers need an appropriate econometric model. Usual time series models, vector autoregression for example, cannot incorporate more than a few variables. There are two ways to solve this problem: use variable selection procedures or gather the information contained in the series to create an index model. This thesis focuses {{on one of the most}} widespread index model, the dynamic factor model (the theory behind this model, based on previous literature, is the core of the first part of this study), and its use in forecasting Finnish macroeconomic indicators (which is the focus of the second part of the thesis). In particular, I forecast economic activity indicators (e. g. GDP) and price indicators (e. g. consumer price index), from 3 large Finnish datasets. The first dataset contains a large series of aggregated data obtained from the Statistics Finland database. The second dataset is composed by economic indicators from Bank of Finland. The last dataset is formed by disaggregated data from Statistic Finland, which I call micro dataset. The forecasts are computed following a two steps procedure: in the first step I estimate a set of common factors from the original dataset. The second step consists in formulating forecasting equations including the factors extracted previously. The predictions are evaluated using relative mean squared forecast error, where the benchmark model is a univariate autoregressive model. The results are dataset-dependent. The forecasts based on factor models are very accurate for the first dataset (the Statistics Finland one), while they are considerably worse for the Bank of Finland dataset. The forecasts derived from the micro dataset are still good, but less accurate than the ones obtained in the first case. This work leads to multiple research developments. The results here obtained can be replicated for longer datasets. The non-aggregated data can be represented in an even more disaggregated form (firm level). Finally, the use of the micro data, one of the major contributions of this thesis, can be useful in the imputation of missing values and the creation of <b>flash</b> <b>estimates</b> of macroeconomic indicator (nowcasting) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{economic}} and financial environment has become much gloomier in recent months, with the slowdown in activity and international trade, the dramatic worsening of the sovereign debt crisis in the euro area {{and its impact on}} financial institutions, and the plummeting confidence of business leaders and consumers. The prospects for the euro area have therefore been sharply downgraded since all the main categories of demand are likely to contribute to the weakness of activity, including public expenditure on consumption and investment in the countries implementing fiscal consolidation measures. In Belgium, during the summer of 2011, the deterioration in the external environment, the rising financial tensions and the accompanying heightened uncertainty halted the recovery apparent since mid- 2009. According to the NAI’s <b>flash</b> <b>estimates,</b> GDP stagnated in the third quarter and growth is expected to remain close to zero {{at the end of the}} year and in early 2012. Activity is expected to pick up thereafter, but the revival is likely to be modest. GDP growth is estimated at 2 % in 2011 and 0. 5 % in 2012. These figures have been revised downwards by 0. 6 and 1. 8 percentage points respectively since the projections published in June. The slowdown in activity has brought a marked reduction in job creation, even though the figures are still supported by the expansion in the number of persons employed under the service voucher system and in the health sector and other non-market services. In net terms, the increase in the number of persons employed is expected to fall from around 56 000 units in the course of 2011 to 5 000 in 2012. The declining trend in unemployment, down from 8. 5 % in the spring of 2010 to 6. 6 % in October 2011, will be reversed in 2012. On average, the harmonised unemployment rate is put at 7 % for that year. While the recovery of GDP gradually spread to all factors of demand up to the second quarter of 2011, the resurgence of financial tensions and the widespread deterioration in the business climate and the outlook will probably affect both exports and demand for household consumption and private investment. The rise in energy prices has propelled overall inflation to more than 3 % since the beginning of 2011. Taking account of the assumption of a slight dip in oil prices compared to the previous year, inflation should gradually subside during 2012. As an annual average, inflation is forecast at 3. 5 % in 2011 and 2. 4 % in 2012, which will fuel the rise in labour costs. The projections for public finances presented in this article do not go beyond 2011, since the budgetary agreement concluded on 26 November 2011 in connection with the formation of the federal government came after the cut-off date for the projections. Public finances are expected to record a deficit of 4. 2 % of GDP at the end of 2011. The government debt ratio has increased as a result of the loans contracted by the Belgian State to finance the purchase of Dexia Bank Belgium and by the loans granted to Greece, Ireland and Portugal.

While the situation on the job market has improved markedly during the winter months due to the good performance of the economy and the mild weather, unemployment nevertheless continues to be relatively high. ...|$|R
