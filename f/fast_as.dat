Babb often booked the movie as a midnight presentation {{twice a week}} in the same town; David F.

Kid Nichols remarked in 1902 that Stivetts' speed was as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> Rusie, and could have extended his career much longer had he taken better care of his body. Baseball writer O. P.

Seabait uses some of the excess hot water that the plant generates to grow worms four times as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> in the wild. The worms are used for several purposes, {{primarily}} for providing worms as bait while fishing. However, the worms are also frozen, packaged and exported to seafood farms. This is seen as environmentally beneficial as it reduces the need for bait digging in natural habitats.|$|E

During the first weekend of sales, an aggregated amount of 3 million fourth-generation iPads and iPad Minis were sold.|$|E
5|$|Traditional {{ice cream}} is frozen egg custard with {{flavours}} added. Blumenthal whisks egg yolks with sugar until the sugar {{interacts with the}} proteins in the yolk, creating a network of proteins.

5|$|A cold front's {{location}} {{is at the}} leading edge of the temperature drop-off, which in an isotherm analysis shows up as {{the leading edge of the}} isotherm gradient, and it normally lies within a sharp surface trough. Cold fronts can move up to twice as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> warm fronts and produce sharper changes in weather, since cold air is denser than warm air and rapidly lifts the warm air as the cold air moves in. Cold fronts are typically accompanied by a narrow band of showers and thunderstorms. On a weather map, the surface position of the cold front is marked with the symbol of a blue line of triangles/spikes (pips) pointing in the direction of travel, {{at the leading edge}} of the cooler air mass.|$|E

5|$|A {{monument}} to Civil War Union General John Sedgwick {{stands on the}} outskirts of the Plain. Sedgwick's bronze statue has spurs with rowels that freely rotate. Legend states that if a cadet is in danger of failing a class, they are to don their full-dress parade uniform the night before the final exam. The cadet visits the statue and spins the rowels at the stroke of midnight. Then the cadet runs back to the barracks as <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> he or she can. According to legend, if Sedgwick's ghost catches them, they will fail the exam. Otherwise the cadet will pass the exam and the course. Although being out of their rooms after midnight is officially against regulations, violations have been known to be overlooked for the sake of tradition.|$|E

A fog settled in and concealed the evacuation from the British. British patrols noticed that there {{did not seem to be}} any American pickets and thus began to search the area. While they were doing this, Washington, the last man left, stepped onto the last boat. At 07:00, the last American troops landed in Manhattan. All 9,000 troops had been evacuated with no loss of life.|$|E
5|$|Benchmark tests {{conducted}} by SlashGear {{concluded that the}} SoC of the fourth-generation iPad is able to perform CPU-reliant tasks {{more than twice as}} <b>fast</b> <b>as</b> that of the third-generation iPad. A series of benchmark tests conducted on the graphics performance of the fourth-generation iPad by Anandtech resulted in the device achieving the highest score compared to other consumer mobile devices, including the Samsung Galaxy S III, Nexus 10 and third-generation iPad. The performance increase of the fourth-generation iPad varies between tests, however an increase is nonetheless evident. Furthermore, battery longevity tests {{conducted by}} the same organization suggests that the battery of the fourth-generation iPad is able to last longer than its predecessor. However, the battery of the updated iPad 2 is able to outlast the fourth-generation iPad.|$|E
