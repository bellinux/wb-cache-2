5|$|Saguaro National Park's oldest rocks, the Pinal Schist, pre-date the {{formation}} of the contemporary Basin and Range Province, of which the park is a part, by about 1.7billion years. The schist is exposed in the RMD along a <b>dry</b> <b>wash</b> off Cactus Forest Loop Drive. Other ancient rocks, 1.4-billion-year-old altered granites, form much of Tanque Verde Ridge in the RMD.|$|E
5|$|Saguaro National Park {{lies within}} the {{watershed}} of the north-flowing Santa Cruz River, {{which is generally}} dry. Rincon Creek {{in the southern part}} of the RMD, free-flowing for at least part of the year, has the largest riparian zone in the park. The creek is a tributary of Pantano Wash, which crosses Tucson from southeast to northwest to meet Tanque Verde Wash. The two washes form the Rillito River, another <b>dry</b> <b>wash,</b> an east–west tributary of the Santa Cruz River. The washes in both districts are usually dry but are subject at times to flash floods. Smaller riparian zones are found near springs and tinajas in the RMD. The largest of the springs is at Manning Camp, high in the Rincons.|$|E
25|$|Chaffee {{decided to}} remain with the army after the war. He was posted to the western frontier, and was {{promoted}} to captain of Regulars in October 1867. For the next thirty years {{he served in the}} Indian Wars, fighting the Central Plains and Southwestern tribes. In 1868, he was brevetted major for his actions at Paint Creek, Texas. In the following years he engaged the Indians many times, most notably at Red River, Texas, in 1874, and Big <b>Dry</b> <b>Wash,</b> Arizona, in 1882, for which he was brevetted lieutenant colonel.|$|E

25|$|Horn {{allegedly}} {{killed his}} first {{man in a}} duel— a second lieutenant in the Mexican Army, whom he killed {{as a result of}} a dispute with a prostitute. At sixteen, Horn headed to the American Southwest, where he was hired by the U.S. Cavalry as a civilian scout, packer and interpreter under Al Sieber during the Apache Wars. Horn did a great job in his work for the army, and soon he rose through the ranks. In one instance, as Sieber, Horn, and the army were crossing the Cibicue Creek, they were ambushed by Apaches warriors positioned on high ground. The officer in charge of their squad, Captain Edmund Hentig, was instantly killed, and the men became pinned down under overwhelming fire. Desperate, Sieber ordered Horn and another scout, Mickey Free, to break away and return fire from a hill. Together with the soldiers, the men managed to repel the attack. Tom Horn and Al Sieber participated during the Battle of Big <b>Dry</b> <b>Wash,</b> and gained recognition when he and Lt. George H. Morgan slipped through the banks opposite of the Apache line, and provided covering fire for the cavalry as well as killing a number of Apaches warriors.|$|E
60|$|Bending {{back to get}} in {{line with}} her {{pointing}} finger Hare looked through a network of cedar boughs to see a fence of stripped pines. Farther up were piles of unstripped logs, and close by the spring {{there was a new}} cabin with smoke curling from a stone chimney. Hare guided Silvermane off the trail to softer ground and went on. He climbed the slope, passed the old pool, now a mud-puddle, and crossed the <b>dry</b> <b>wash</b> to be brought suddenly to a halt. Wolf had made an uneasy stand with his nose pointing to the left, and Silvermane pricked up his ears. Presently Hare heard the stamping of hoofs off in the cedars, and before he had fully determined the direction from which the sound came three horses and a man stepped from the shade into a sunlit space.|$|E
60|$|Satan was {{creeping}} {{close to}} Wallace and Jones, with Frank looming white through the occasional pinyons. Then all {{dropped out of}} sight, to appear again suddenly. They had reached the first break. Soon I was upon it. Two deer {{ran out of the}} ravine, almost brushing my horse in the haste. Satan went down and up in a few giant strides. Only the narrow ridge separated us from another break. It was up and down then for Satan, a work to which he manfully set himself. Occasionally I saw Wallace and Jones, but heard them oftener. All the time the breaks grew deeper, till finally Satan had to zigzag his way down and up. Discouragement fastened on me, when from the summit of the next ridge I saw Frank far down the break, with Jones and Wallace not {{a quarter of a mile}} away from him. I sent out a long, exultant yell as Satan crashed into the hard, <b>dry</b> <b>wash</b> in the bottom of the break.|$|E

60|$|That ravine {{became a}} canyon. At its head {{it was a}} <b>dry</b> <b>wash,</b> full of gravel and rocks. It began to cut deep into {{the bowels of the}} earth. It shut out sight of the {{surrounding}} walls and peaks. Water appeared from under a cliff and, augmented by other springs, became a brook. Hot, dry, and barren at its beginning, this cleft became cool and shady and luxuriant with grass and flowers and amber moss with silver blossoms. The rocks had changed color from yellow to deep red. Four hours of turning and twisting, endlessly down and down, over boulders and banks and every conceivable roughness of earth and rock, finished the pack-mustang; and Slone mercifully left him in a long reach of canyon where grass and water never failed. In this place Slone halted for the noon hour, letting Nagger have his fill of the rich grazing. Nagger's three days in grassy upland, despite the continuous travel by day, had improved him. He looked fat, and Slone had not yet caught the horse resting. Nagger was iron to endure. Here Slone left all the outfit except what was on his saddle, and the sack containing the few pounds of meat and supplies, and the two utensils. This sack he tied {{on the back of his}} saddle, and resumed his journey.|$|E
60|$|They {{entered a}} region where mineral abounded, and their march became slower. Generally they took {{the course of a}} wash, one on each side, and let the burros travel leisurely along nipping at the {{bleached}} blades of scant grass, or at sage or cactus, while they searched in the canyons and under the ledges for signs of gold. When they found any rock that hinted of gold they picked off a piece and gave it a chemical test. The search was fascinating. They interspersed the work with long, restful moments when they looked afar down the vast reaches and smoky shingles to the line of dim mountains. Some impelling desire, not all the lure of gold, took them to the top of mesas and escarpments; and here, when they had dug and picked, they rested and gazed out at the wide prospect. Then, as the sun lost its heat and sank lowering to dent its red disk behind far-distant spurs, they halted in a shady canyon or likely spot in a <b>dry</b> <b>wash</b> and tried for water. When they found it they unpacked, gave drink to the tired burros, and turned them loose. Dead mesquite served for the campfire. While the strange twilight deepened into weird night they sat propped against stones, with eyes on the dying embers of the fire, and soon they lay on the sand with the light of white stars on their dark faces.|$|E
