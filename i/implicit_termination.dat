That behavior can be changed if the cursor is declared using the WITH HOLD clause. (The default is WITHOUT HOLD.) A holdable cursor is kept open over COMMIT and closed upon ROLLBACK. (Some DBMS deviate from this standard behavior and also keep holdable cursors open over ROLLBACK.) ...|$|E

We prove correctness and <b>implicit</b> <b>termination</b> of our algorithm that apply to distributed constraint satisfaction problems, and also leads to significant speed-ups on distributions of constraint satisfaction problems. 1 Introduction Constraint propagation {{is one of the most}} important techniques for finding solutions to sets of constraints. Constraint propagation algorithms usually aim at reaching some local consistency by gradually reducing a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP) to another one that is equivalent but simpler. These algorithms were generally designed for specific constraint domains and a generic approach was proposed in [1, 2] based {{on the notion of}} chaotic iteration, a general technique used for computing limits of iterations of finite sets of functions. In this paper, we present a framework for distributed constraint propa [...] ...|$|E

These “soft contracts” constitute a hybrid instrument adapted to the transactional hazards of an environment in which neither formal contract nor reputation effects can adequately specify and enforce parties’ commitments at any reasonable cost. Uncertainly enforceable contracts embed an <b>implicit</b> <b>termination</b> and renegotiation option that provides flexibility to respond to changed circumstances while maintaining a threat of legal liability that provides some transactional security. Evidence collected from litigation records, trade press coverage and field interviews show that parties select “softer” or “harder” contractual instruments following a marginal cost-benefit calculus that secures parties’ commitments at the lowest transaction-cost burden. Observed differences in the formalization levels selected with respect to different stages, elements, and parties in a film production reflect underlying differences in reputational capital, transactional experience, specification costs, enforcement costs, and holdup risk. A survey of litigation records and trade press coverage since the inception of the Hollywood motion picture industry suggests that soft contracts emerged as a substitute for the long-term employment contracts that secured studios’ and talent’s commitments in the “studio system” era...|$|E
