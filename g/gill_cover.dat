25|$|Cods of {{the genus}} Gadus have three rounded dorsal and two anal fins. The pelvic fins are small, with the first ray extended, and are set under the <b>gill</b> <b>cover</b> (i.e. the throat region), {{in front of the}} {{pectoral}} fins. The upper jaw extends over the lower jaw, which has a well-developed chin barbel. The eyes are medium-sized, approximately the same as the length of the chin barbel. Cod have a distinct white lateral line running from the gill slit above the pectoral fin, {{to the base of the}} caudal or tail fin. The back tends to be a greenish to sandy brown, and shows extensive mottling, especially towards the lighter sides and white belly. Dark brown colouration of the back and sides is not uncommon, especially for individuals that have resided in rocky inshore regions.|$|E
25|$|Water {{is drawn}} {{in through the}} mouth by closing the {{operculum}} (<b>gill</b> <b>cover),</b> and enlarging the mouth cavity (Fig. 23). Simultaneously the gill chambers enlarge, producing a lower pressure there than in the mouth causing water to flow over the gills. The mouth cavity then contracts inducing {{the closure of the}} passive oral valves, thereby preventing the back-flow of water from the mouth (Fig. 23). The water in the mouth is, instead, forced over the gills, while the gill chambers contract emptying the water they contain through the opercular openings (Fig. 23). Back-flow into the gill chamber during the inhalatory phase is prevented by a membrane along the ventroposterior border of the operculum (diagram on the left in Fig. 23). Thus the mouth cavity and gill chambers act alternately as suction pump and pressure pump to maintain a steady flow of water over the gills in one direction. Since the blood in the lamellar capillaries flows in the opposite direction to that of the water, the consequent countercurrent flow of blood and water maintains steep concentration gradients for oxygen and carbon dioxide along the entire length of each capillary (lower diagram in Fig.22). Oxygen is therefore able to continually diffuse down its gradient into the blood, and the carbon dioxide down its gradient into the water. Although countercurrent exchange systems theoretically allow an almost complete transfer of a respiratory gas {{from one side of the}} exchanger to the other, in fish less than 80% of the oxygen in the water flowing over the gills is generally transferred to the blood.|$|E

2500|$|Northern pike {{are most}} often olive green, shading from yellow to white along the belly. The [...] is marked with short, light bar-like spots and a few to many dark spots on the fins. Sometimes, the fins are reddish. Younger pike have yellow stripes along a green body; later, the stripes divide into light spots and the body turns from green to olive green. The {{lower half of the}} <b>gill</b> <b>cover</b> lacks scales, and it has large sensory pores on its head and on the {{underside}} of its lower jaw which are part of the lateral line system. Unlike the similar-looking and closely related muskellunge, the northern pike has light markings on a dark body background and fewer than six sensory pores on the underside of each side of the lower jaw.|$|E
2500|$|... {{into thin}} {{filaments}} of varying lengths. The anal fin has 2 anteriorly detached spines {{followed by a}} single spine connected to 16 to 18 soft rays. The lobes of both the anal and dorsal fin are highly extended, giving the species its name. The anal fins also show extension into filaments to a lesser degree. The pectoral fins are falcate to subfalcate with 18-20 rays, while the caudal fin is deeply forked with bilateral, paired caudal keels. The pelvic fins are short, and fit in fairly pronounced ventral grooves, {{similar to that of}} Atropus atropos The lateral line is moderately arched anteriorly, with the curved section containing 57 to 77 scales, while the straight section contains 25 to 43 elements, 11 to 24 of which are weak scutes. Another of the diagnostic traits of the longfin trevally is the scaleless breast, extending from the origin of the pelvic fins {{to the base of the}} pectoral fin and anteriorly to the <b>gill</b> <b>cover.</b> There are 24 vertebrae in the species.|$|E
2500|$|Cod {{and related}} species are plagued by parasites. For example, the cod worm, Lernaeocera branchialis, starts {{life as a}} copepod, a small free-swimming {{crustacean}} larva. The first host used by cod worm is a flatfish or lumpsucker, which they capture with grasping hooks {{at the front of}} their body. They penetrate the lumpsucker with a thin [...] which they use to suck its blood. The nourished cod worms then mate on the lumpsucker. The female worm, with her now fertilized eggs, then finds a cod, or a cod-like fish such as a haddock or whiting. There the worm clings to the gills while it metamorphoses into a plump, sinusoidal, wormlike body, with a coiled mass of egg strings at the rear. The front part of the worms body penetrates the body of the cod until it enters the rear bulb of the host's heart. There, firmly rooted in the cod's circulatory system, the front part of the parasite develops like the branches of a tree, reaching into the main artery. In this way, the worm extracts nutrients from the cod's blood, remaining safely tucked beneath the cod's <b>gill</b> <b>cover</b> until it releases a new generation of offspring into the water.|$|E
5000|$|Pomoxis, {{the genus}} name, is Greek: [...] "poma, -atos" [...] and [...] "oxys" [...] meaning sharp operculum. This {{references}} the fish's spined <b>gill</b> <b>covers.</b> The species name, nigromaculatus, {{is derived from}} Latin and means [...] "black-spotted".|$|R

End of the caudal fin is dusky in color (a scattered black patch is present in caudal base). Back of the head is greenish yellow in color.|$|R

2500|$|The wings {{themselves}} are sometimes {{said to be}} highly modified (tracheal) gills. And {{there is no doubt}} that the tracheal gills of the mayfly nymph in many species look like wings. By comparing a well-developed pair of gill blades in the naiads and a reduced pair of hind wings on the adults, it is not hard to imagine that the mayfly gills (tergaliae) and insect wings have a common origin, and newer research also supports this. [...] The tergaliae are not found in any other order of insects, and they have evolved in different directions with time. In some nymphs/naiads the most anterior pair has become sclerotized and works as a <b>gill</b> <b>cover</b> for the rest of the gills. Others can form a large sucker, be used for swimming or modified into other shapes. But it doesn't have to mean that these structures were originally gills. It could also mean that the tergaliae evolved from the same structures which gave rise to the wings, and that flying insects evolved from a wingless terrestrial species with pairs of plates on its body segments: three on the thorax and nine on the abdomen (mayfly nymphs with nine pairs of tergaliae on the abdomen exist, but so far no living or extinct insects with plates on the last two segments have been found). If these were primary gills, it would be a mystery why they should have waited so long to be modified when we see the different modifications in modern mayfly nymphs.|$|E
