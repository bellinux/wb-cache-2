5|$|An {{endpoint}} of a pipe is addressable with a tuple (device_address, endpoint_number) as {{specified in}} a TOKEN packet that the <b>host</b> sends when {{it wants to}} start a data transfer session. If {{the direction of the}} data transfer is from the <b>host</b> to the endpoint, an OUT packet (a specialization of a TOKEN packet) having the desired device address and endpoint number is sent by the <b>host.</b> If the direction of the data transfer is from the device to the <b>host,</b> the <b>host</b> sends an IN packet instead. If the destination endpoint is a uni-directional endpoint whose manufacturer's designated direction does not match the TOKEN packet (e.g. the manufacturer's designated direction is IN while the TOKEN packet is an OUT packet), the TOKEN packet is ignored. Otherwise, it is accepted and the data transaction can start. A bi-directional endpoint, on the other hand, accepts both IN and OUT packets.|$|E

5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected <b>host</b> cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or endoplasmic reticulum, thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope.

Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E

5|$|Fleas feed on a {{wide variety}} of warm-blooded {{vertebrates}} including humans, dogs, cats, rabbits, squirrels, ferrets, rats, mice and birds. Fleas normally specialise in one <b>host</b> species or group of species, but can often feed but not reproduce on other species. Ceratophyllus gallinae affects poultry as well as wild birds. As well as the degree of relatedness of a potential <b>host</b> to the flea's original <b>host,</b> it has been shown that avian fleas that exploit a range of hosts, only parasitise species with low immune responses. In general, <b>host</b> specificity decreases as the size of the <b>host</b> species decreases. Another factor is the opportunities available to the flea to change <b>host</b> species; this is smaller in colonially nesting birds, where the flea may never encounter another species, than it is in solitary nesting birds. A large, long-lived <b>host</b> provides a stable environment that favours host-specific parasites.|$|E
5|$|For a {{parasitic}} organism, its {{habitat is}} the particular {{part of the}} outside or inside of its <b>host</b> on or {{in which it is}} adapted to live. The life cycle of some parasites involves several different <b>host</b> species, as well as free-living life stages, sometimes providing vastly different microhabitats. One such organism is the trematode (flatworm) Microphallus turgidus, present in brackish water marshes in the southeastern United States. Its first intermediate <b>host</b> is a snail and the second, a glass shrimp. The final <b>host</b> is the waterfowl or mammal that consumes the shrimp.|$|E
