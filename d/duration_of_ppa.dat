40|$|Introduction: Post-partum {{amenorrhea}} (PPA) is {{the duration}} variable, which {{is directly related}} to the levels of fertility. The timing of occurrence of the first menstruation after delivery is known as the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>PPA.</b> It is a temporary infecundable period where mothers are most likely to be free from possible conception.

40|$|The main aim of {{this paper}} is to use some {{indirect}} techniques to estimate the duration of post-partum amenorrhea (PPA) among Nepalese mothers by using the data of Ministry of Health (MOH 2001, 2006). The techniques used are based on two types of data, i. e., <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> and breastfeeding (BF). Among the techniques, the one developed by Aryal (2008) provided a very close estimate of the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> period among Nepalese mothers. The estimated average PPA period was found to be 11. 8 months against the observed value of 11. 1 months in 2001 data (MOH 2001) while it was 10. 3 months against the observed value of 9. 3 months in 2006 data (MOH 2006). Estimated PPA period was found to be much close especially by fitting the inverse and logarithmic models. In addition to this, <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> period was also estimated in relation to the characteristics of mothers and the results were found to be consistent with the observed values. It is therefore the used techniques provided very close estimate of PPA period, which might be an applicable technique to estimate the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> period for any population if the data of the duration of breastfeeding are available...|$|E

By varying the <b>durations</b> <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> treatment, halloysites with {{different}} levels of enfoldment and intercalation were obtained. Halloysites, particularly with the unfolded and intercalated halloysites, were effective additives in increasing the fracture toughness of the cured epoxies without sacrificing their basic properties. Fracture toughness of composites was increased with increasing intercalation levels of halloysite, with the improvement being 78. 3 % in K(IC) for the composite containing 10 wt. % of the fully PPA-intercalated and unfolded halloysite. There was {{a substantial increase in}} the contact area between halloysite and epoxy, and as a result the morphology changed from nanotubes to nano-platelets in the composites with the treated halloysites. The treated halloysites achieved a better dispersion in epoxy and promoted the formation {{of a large number of}} micro-cracks and plastic deformations in the interfaces, resulting in an improvement in fracture toughness.

Whilst numerous studies have been carried out to assess the central and cardiovascular safety <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> and many investigations have been performed to evaluate efficacy in terms of weight loss in humans, there is a relative paucity of information regarding the effects <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> on appetite and food intake. A pilot trial was conducted to determine the feasiblility of a multidimensional approach to evaluate the safety and efficacy <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> as ananorectic agent in humans. Eight normotensive caucasian women who were overweight participated in a randomised double-blind cross-over comparison <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> (75 mg) and placebo and were dosed to steady-state on a 12 -hour fixed-dose schedule for a period of eleven weeks. Aspects of efficacy evaluated included the effects <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> on hunger, appetite and satiety,salivation, macro-nutrient food intake and body weight. Standardised scales were used to quantitatively assess the possible subjective mood and behavioural reinforcing effects <b>of</b> <b>PPA.</b> Supine systolic and diastolic blood pressures were monitored continually throughout the trial.

In particular, phenothiazine compounds have demonstrated efficacy for PDT of CL. The objective of our present study is to define the use of a new specific phenothiazine photosensitizer, 3, 7 -bis(di-n-butylamino) phenothiazin- 5 -ium bromide (PPA 904) applied topically as a cream to treat CL. Materials And Methods: To establish the optimal conditions for this treatment, we compared two different ways to improve current regimens <b>of</b> PDT with <b>PPA</b> 904 cream (500 mu M <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> 904 in Unguentum M) by changing the <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> topical application, and by administration of several consecutive PDT procedures. An initial regimen recommended by the manufacturer (Photopharmica Co.

40|$|Phenylpropanolamine (PPA), a {{sympathomimetic}} amine, {{has been}} widely used over the past 40 years as a decongestant and, in much larger dosages, as an appetite suppressant. Considerable interest has recently been shown in this drug due to its increasing popularity as an over-the-counter anorectic agent. Much controversy exists concerning the unfavourable side-effects <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> resulting from the higher doses required for appetite suppression and the potential of this drug for abuse. A literature search revealed a paucity of information concerning the determination <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> in biological fluids and, most noticeably, on the pharmacokinetics of this drug. An original method for determining PPA in serum and urine using high performance liquid chromatography (HPLC) which has increased sensitivity over other published HPLC methods is presented here. The simplicity of the extraction from biological fluids and subsequent determination by HPLC, enables concentrations <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> to be monitored after a single dose of the drug. This method is therefore readily applicable to bioavailability and pharmacokinetic studies. The dissolution profiles of 4 sustained-release formulations <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> were determined in a modified USP rotating paddle apparatus and the samples analysed using HPLC.

Although early CF diagnosis through newborn screening (NBS) {{has been shown to}} provide nutritional/growth benefit, it is unclear whether NBS lowers the risk <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> infection and how the effect of NBS vary with age. Modeling the onset age <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> infection is challenging because 1) the onset age <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> infection is interval censored in patient registry data; and 2) some risk factors such as NBS may have time-varying effects. Methods This problem fits into the framework of a recently developed Bayesian dynamic Cox model for interval censored data, where each regression coefficient is allowed to be time-varying to an extent determined by the data. Results Application of the methodology to data from the CF Foundation Patient Registry revealed interesting findings. Compared with patients with meconium ileus or diagnosed through signs or symptoms, patients diagnosed through NBS had significantly lower risks <b>of</b> acquiring <b>PPA</b> infection between age 1 and 2 years, and the benefit in survival rate was found to last up to age 4 years.

40|$|Following {{the first}} {{description}} of a case series of patients with a ’languagepredominant’ dementia syndrome by Marsel Mesulam in 1982, the term primary progressive aphasia (PPA) was coined. The primary symptom <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> {{is the loss of}} language, which is progressive in nature. As of 2011, three clinical subtypes within the spectrum <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> are internationally recognized: a nonfluent/agrammatic (NFV), a semantic (SV) and a logopenic variant (LV). Of the LV cases, 50 - 60 % have underlying Alzheimer’s disease (AD) pathology. In 50 - 88 % of NFV cases the underlying cause is frontotemporal lobar degeneration (FTLD) -tauopathy (i. e. corticobasal degeneration (CBD), progressive supranuclear palsy (PSP) or Pick’s disease pathology) and 69 - 83 % of SV cases have FTLD-Transactive response DNA binding Protein 43 kDa (TDP- 43) type C pathology as underlying cause. Despite gradually increasing knowledge, the pathophysiology <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> remains still poorly understood. The general aim of this thesis was to study pathophysiological mechanisms underlying PPA at a behavioral, structural and molecular imaging level. Using non-linguistic, acoustic stimuli devoid of meaning, we demonstrated that a subset <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> patients were impaired in key domains of nonverbal core auditory processing. Patients with NFV PPA had the most marked deficits within the time/rhythm domain for the processing of short sequences of up to seven tones. A subset of the SV patients were also impaired, though less severely. Patients with LV PPA did not show any significant individual impairments. Our sound perception data allowed reliable discrimination of NFV from LV cases even though these contained no language stimuli and were purely based on perceptual judgment of pitch and rhythm in tone sequences. We also demonstrated that performance on a subset of the psychoacoustic tests correlated with conventional verbal repetition tests. Rhythm and time processing deficits in NFV PPA relied on right-hemispheric brain structures including the frontal operculum and posterior insula. We postulate that auditory timing pathways are altered in NFV PPA, which are used in common for processing acoustic sequence structure in both speech output and acoustic input. The perceptual timing deficits may contribute to the speech apraxia in NFV which is characterized by abnormal <b>duration</b> <b>of</b> inter-segmental time intervals of speech among other features. A subset <b>of</b> NFV <b>PPA</b> patients have single-word comprehension problems besides motor speech problems and/or agrammatism. These patients are considered as the fourth ’mixed’ variant (MV) <b>of</b> <b>PPA.</b> Based on imaging results reported in the current thesis, MV PPA showed a tau PET pattern, measured by [18 F]-THK 5351, which is highly similar to that observed in patients with NFV without single-word comprehension deficits (NFV-pure), namely increased [18 F]-THK 5351 binding in the premotor cortex and supplementary motor area. The topography of [18 F]-THK 5351 binding, but not the degree of atrophy was correlated with core clinical features <b>of</b> MV <b>PPA.</b> In MV, the atrophy pattern was more widespread and patients had a higher likelihood of underlying Alzheimer’s disease pathology compared to NFV-pure PPA. Next, we investigated in a series <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> patients whether basal forebrain (BF) volume loss relates to cholinergic depletion and how this depends on the PPA variant. The BF is reportedly atrophic in SV and in NFV PPA, which might indicate a cholinergic deficit. Acetylcholinesterase (AChE) activity, a cholinergic system marker, was quantitatively measured in the neo- and allocortex using N-[11 C]-Methylpiperidin- 4 -yl propionate (PMP) -PET with arterial sampling and metabolite correction. In the PPA group, only LV cases showed decreases in AChE activity levels compared to controls. Surprisingly, a substantial number of SV cases showed significant AChE activity increases compared to controls. We concluded that based on our findings, BF atrophy in SV PPA does not imply cholinergic depletion. In summary, the findings reported in this thesis shed light on the non-linguistic, acoustic processing deficits and the underlying neuronanatomical, and molecular imaging correlates which contribute to the clinical phenotype <b>of</b> <b>PPA.</b> Despite increasing knowledge, truly disease-modifying therapies are currently not available in PPA. Based on our findings, tau PET provides a direct measure of the topographic distribution of the underlying brain changes and could be of value in future trials in clinical drug development. A subset of LV cases could potentially benefit from treatment with cholinomimetic medication. status: accepte...|$|R

Briefly, crystallinity helps with chemical resistance and mechanical properties above the {{glass transition}} temperature (but below the melting point). Amorphous polymers are good in warpage and transparency.|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{objective}} of this retrospective study was to report the efficacy of a single daily oral dose <b>of</b> phenylpropanolamine (<b>PPA)</b> {{in the treatment of}} urethral sphincter mechanism incompetence (USMI) in bitches. Nine bitches diagnosed with USMI were treated with a single daily dose (1. 5 mg/kg) <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> for at least 1 month. Urethral pressure profiles (UPP) were performed in 7 dogs before treatment and repeated in 4 of them after treatment. Treatment with PPA resulted in long-term continence in 8 / 9 bitches. One dog did not respond to PPA and was treated surgically later. Recheck UPPs showed a significant increase in maximal urethral closure pressure in the 4 bitches after treatment with PPA compared to before treatment. In conclusion, long-term continence can be achieved in bitches affected with USMI after administration of a single daily dose <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> (1. 5 mg/kg). Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|On March 16, 2013, the United States {{implemented}} the Leahy-Smith America Invents Act (AIA). Enactment of the AIA substantially enhances {{the value of}} U. S. provisional and non-provisional patent applications (PPAs and NPAs) to foreign applicants. Here, the authors endeavor to outline the procedural and strategic considerations facing foreign applicants for PPAs by offering a brief survey of protective foreign patent application law, followed by {{an analysis of the}} modern benefits <b>of</b> <b>PPA</b> filing in the post-AIA world. The analysis here suggests that the traditional benefits to foreign filers <b>of</b> <b>PPAs</b> encompassing term extension, cost-efficiency and secrecy have been amplified by the establishment of a first-to-file priority system in the United States...|$|R
