5|$|The {{baguette}} sandwiches {{were introduced}} to Europe starting in the UK in 2003, with several new varieties designed to cater to the population mix of the country. While the baguette sandwiches were well received {{and continue to be}} sold, several red flags have been raised by the British government and private groups in regards the <b>healthiness</b> of these and other products sold by the fast food industry. In 2005, British Food Standards Agency (FSA) cited large levels of fats and salt in the company's beef-based Monterey Melt baguette and chided BK for backing out of an agreement to help make the company's products healthier. In 2007 the private public interest group Consensus Action on Salt and Health, abbreviated to CASH, cited Burger King and other fast food chains over the continued levels of sodium contained in these types of foods. The group specifically claimed that the Chicken BLT Baguette sandwich, when paired with fries and a Coca-Cola, was one of the three saltiest fast food products in the UK.|$|E

Numerous studies were undertaken to establish the metabolism of this compound and to determine the quantity, which is produced depending on the <b>healthiness</b> of the human.

[...] Conditions at the Radcliffe mill were improved; in 1795 John Aikin's A Description of the Country from thirty to forty miles round Manchester said of Peel's mills [...] "The peculiar <b>healthiness</b> of-the people employed may be imputed partly to the judicious and humane regulations put in practice by Mr. Peel, and partly to the salubrity of the air and climate." ...|$|E
2500|$|Bruises often induce pain, {{but small}} bruises are not {{normally}} dangerous alone. Sometimes bruises can be serious, leading to other more life-threatening forms of hematoma, {{such as when}} associated with serious injuries, including fractures and more severe internal bleeding. [...] The likelihood and severity of bruising depends on many factors, including type and <b>healthiness</b> of affected tissues. Minor bruises may be easily recognized in people with light skin color by characteristic blue or purple appearance (idiomatically described as [...] "black and blue") {{in the days following}} the injury.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the first}} phase of his {{renovation}} Haussmann constructed [...] of new boulevards, at a net cost of 278 million francs. The official parliamentary report of 1859 found that it had [...] "brought air, light and <b>healthiness</b> and procured easier circulation in a labyrinth that was constantly blocked and impenetrable, where streets were winding, narrow, and dark." [...] It had employed thousands of workers, and most Parisians were pleased by the results. [...] His second phase, approved by the Emperor and parliament in 1858 and begun in 1859, was much more ambitious. [...] He intended to build a network of wide boulevards to connect the interior of Paris with the ring of grand boulevards built by Louis XVIII during the restoration, and to the new railroad stations which Napoleon III considered the real gates of the city. [...] He planned to construct [...] of new avenues and streets, at a cost of 180 million francs. [...] Haussmann's plan called for the following: ...|$|E
2500|$|Stirling's {{report to}} Darling and Frazer's {{report on the}} quality of the land were {{enclosed}} with Darlings report of 21 April 1827 to the Colonial Office in the United Kingdom. [...] Stirling's report consisted of a diary Narrative of Operations and a section Observations on the Territory, which included a report by Clause on the <b>healthiness</b> of the climate. [...] Later events showed that all three reports were over enthusiastic, the party having explored only the strip of soil in the vicinity of the Swan. [...] Frazer was heavily criticised for this later. However, in their defence, both Clause and Frazer were subject to Stirling's intense enthusiasm for the project and may have been unduly influenced by it. [...] Stirling wrote a second report on the Swan River on 31 August. [...] This was addressed to the Admiralty and was shorter, placing more emphasis on naval concerns and the strategic value of the area.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the winter}} of 1876, the Macmillans brought out her first volume of Poems (renamed Swallow flights in the English edition of 1877), which was highly praised by the critics. The Examiner spoke of the power and {{originality}} of the verses, {{of the music and}} the intensity as surpassing any verse of George Eliot's, declaring that the sonnet entitled [...] "One Dread" [...] might have been written by Sir Philip Sidney. The Athenaeum also dwelt on the vivid and subtle imagination and delicate loveliness of these verses and their perfection of technique. The Academy spoke warmly of their felicity of epithet, their <b>healthiness,</b> their suggestiveness, their imaginative force pervaded by the depth and sweetness of perfect womanhood. The Tattler pronounced her a mistress of form and of artistic perfection, saying also that England had no poet in such full sympathy with woods and winds and waves, finding in her the one truly natural singer in an age of aesthetic imitation. [...] "She gives the effect of the sudden note of the thrush," [...] it said. [...] "She is as spontaneous as Walther von der Vogelweide. The Times, The Morning Post, the Literary World, all welcomed the book with equally warm praise, and The Pall Mall Gazette spoke of her lyrical feeling as like that which gave a unique charm to Heinrich Heine's songs. She had met very few of these critics, and their cordial recognition was as surprising to her as it was delightful. Among the innumerable letters which she received, filled with admiring warmth, were some from Matthew Arnold, Henry Austin Dobson, Frederick Locker, and William Bell Scott.|$|E

60|$|I was of two minds. Her {{laughter}} was delightful to the ear, {{there was such}} a mellowness, and <b>healthiness,</b> and frankness about it.

60|$|He {{knew that}} he did not love her.

6000|$|Among {{the sensations}} serving for our {{guidance}} {{are those of}} heat and cold; and a clothing for children which does not carefully consult these sensations, is to be condemned. The common notion about [...] "hardening" [...] is a grievous delusion. Not a few children are [...] "hardened" [...] out of the world; and those who survive, permanently suffer either in growth or constitution. [...] "Their delicate appearance furnishes ample indication of the mischief thus produced, and their frequent attacks of illness might prove a warning even to unreflecting parents," [...] says Dr. Combe. The reasoning on which this hardening-theory rests is extremely superficial. Wealthy parents, seeing little peasant boys and girls playing about {{in the open air}} only half-clothed, and joining with this fact the general <b>healthiness</b> of labouring people, draw the unwarrantable conclusion that the <b>healthiness</b> {{is the result of the}} exposure, and resolve to keep their own offspring scantily covered! It is forgotten that these urchins who gambol upon village-greens are in many respects favourably circumstanced--that their lives are spent in almost perpetual play; that they are all day breathing fresh air; and that their systems are not disturbed by over-taxed brains. For aught that appears to the contrary, their good health may be maintained, not in consequence of, but in spite of, their deficient clothing. This alternative conclusion we believe to be the true one; and that an inevitable detriment results from the loss of animal heat to which they are subject.|$|E
6000|$|To {{ascertain}} the <b>healthiness</b> {{of the mental}} appetite of a human animal, place in its hands a short, well-written, but not exciting treatise on some popular subject--a mental bun, in fact. If it is read with eager interest and perfect attention, and if the reader can answer questions on the subject afterwards, the mind is in first-rate working order. If it be politely laid down again, or perhaps lounged over for a few minutes, and then, 'I can't read this stupid book! Would you hand me the second volume of [...] "The Mysterious Murder"?' you may be equally {{sure that there is}} something wrong in the mental digestion.|$|E
6000|$|Churra Poonji {{is said to}} be {{so called}} from the number of streams in the neighbourhood, and poonji, [...] "a village" [...] (Khas.): it was {{selected}} for a European station, partly from the elevation and consequent <b>healthiness</b> of the spot, and partly from its being on the high road from Silhet to Gowahatty, on the Burrampooter, the capital of Assam, which is otherwise only accessible by ascending that river, against both its current and the perennial east wind. A rapid postal communication is hereby secured: but the extreme unhealthiness of the northern foot of the mountains effectually precludes all other intercourse for nine months in the year.|$|E
60|$|The {{following}} {{summary of}} hospital admissions affords the best {{test of the}} <b>healthiness</b> of the climate, embracing, as the period does, the three most fatal months to European troops in India. Out of a detachment (105 strong) of H.M. 80th Regiment stationed at Dorjiling, in the seven months from January to July inclusive, there were sixty-four admissions to the hospital, or, on the average, 4-1/3 per cent. per month; and only two deaths, both of dysentery. Many of these men had suffered frequently in the plains from acute dysentery and hepatic affections, and many others had aggravated these complaints by excessive drinking, and two were cases of delirium tremens. During the same period, the number of entries at Calcutta or Dinapore would probably have more than trebled this.|$|E
60|$|But on this {{occasion}} he was unusually grave. Lucy, already surprised at his sudden visit, divined at once from the uneasiness of his pleasant, grey eyes that something was amiss. Her heart began to beat more quickly. He forced himself to smile as he took her hand, congratulating her on the <b>healthiness</b> of her appearance; and they walked slowly from the station. Dick spoke of indifferent things, while Lucy distractedly turned over in her mind all that could have happened. Luncheon was ready for them, and Dick sat down with apparent gusto, praising emphatically the good things she set before him; but he ate as little as she did. He seemed impatient for the meal to end, but unwilling to enter upon the subject which oppressed him. They drank their coffee.|$|E
60|$|The {{impression}} that Mary Clibborn gave was of absolute <b>healthiness,</b> moral and physical. Her appearance was not distinguished, {{but she was}} well set up, with strong hands and solid feet; you knew at once that a ten-mile walk invigorated rather than tired her; her arms were muscular and energetic. She {{was in no way}} striking; a typical, country-bred girl, with a fine digestion and an excellent conscience; if not very pretty, obviously good. Her face showed a happy mingling of strength and cheerfulness; her blue eyes were guileless and frank; her hair even was rather pretty, arranged in the simplest manner; her skin was tanned by wind and weather. The elements were friendly, and she enjoyed a long walk in a gale, with the rain beating against her cheeks. She was dressed simply and without adornment, as befitted her character.|$|E
60|$|To Bernard Maddison it {{had been}} so. To its very depths he {{realized}} it {{as he sat in}} his prison cell with something of the deep passive resignation of the man who stands with one foot in the grave. The latter part of his life--nay, the whole of it--had been full of noble dreams and pure thoughts. His genius had never run riot over the whole face of nature, to yield its fruits in a sickly sweet realism with only faint flashes of his deeper power. Always subordinated by the innate and cultured <b>healthiness</b> of his mind, he had sent it forth a living power for good. Great joy had been his as he had watched his message to the world listened to, and understood, and appreciated. Another age might witness its fruits, it was sufficient for him that the seed was rightly planted.|$|E
60|$|When Alec came {{she rose}} gravely to receive him. For {{a moment he}} was {{overcome}} by her loveliness, and he gazed at her in silence. Lucy {{was a woman who}} was at her best in the tragic situations of life; her beauty was heightened by the travail of her soul, and the heaviness of her eyes gave a pathetic grandeur to her wan face. She advanced to meet sorrow with an unquailing glance, and Alec, who knew something of heroism, recognised the greatness of her heart. Of late he had been more than once to see that portrait of Diana of the Uplands, in which he, too, found the gracious <b>healthiness</b> of Lucy Allerton; but now she seemed like some sad queen, English to the very bones, who bore with a royal dignity an intolerable grief, and yet by the magnificence of her spirit turned into something wholly beautiful.|$|E
60|$|The {{passion for}} {{quotation}} is peculiar to literature. We do not glory to quote our costume, dress in cast-off court robes, or furnish our houses from the marine store. Neither are we proud of alien initials {{on the domestic}} silver. We like things new and primarily our own. We have a wholesome instinct against infection, except, it seems, {{in the matter of}} ideas. An authorling will deliberately inoculate his copy with the inverted comma bacillus, till the page swims unsteadily, counting the fever a glow of pure literary <b>healthiness.</b> Yet this reproduction, rightly considered, is merely a proof that his appetite for books has run beyond his digestion. Or his industry may be to seek. You expect an omelette, and presently up come the unbroken eggs. A tissue of quotation wisely looked at is indeed but a motley garment, eloquent either of a fool, or an idle knave in a fool's disguise.|$|E
6000|$|I {{do indeed}} feel {{the loss of}} Manning, if {{and as far as}} I am capable [...] of feeling anything. It comes to me cumulated, and doubled, with [...] that of James Hope. Nothing like it can ever happen to me again. [...] Arrived now at middle life, I never can form I suppose with any [...] other two men the habits of communication, counsel, and dependence, [...] in which I have now for from fifteen to {{eighteen}} years lived with [...] them both.... My intellect does deliberately reject the grounds on [...] which Manning has proceeded. Indeed they are such as go far to [...] destroy my confidence, which was once and far too long at the [...] highest point, in the <b>healthiness</b> and soundness of his. To show [...] that at any rate this is not from the mere change he has made, I [...] may add, that my conversations with Hope have not left any [...] corresponding impression upon my mind with regard to him.|$|E
6000|$|It has, indeed, {{been the}} {{endeavor}} of some geologists {{to prove that}} destruction and renovation are continually proceeding simultaneously in mountains {{as well as in}} organic creatures; that while existing eminences are being slowly lowered, others, in order to supply their place, are being slowly elevated; and that what is lost in beauty or <b>healthiness</b> in one spot is gained in another. But I cannot assent to such a conclusion. Evidence altogether incontrovertible points to a state of the earth in which it could be tenanted only by lower animals, fitted for the circumstances under which they lived by peculiar organizations. From this state it is admitted gradually to have been brought into that in which we now see it; and the circumstances of the existing dispensation, whatever may be the date of its endurance, seem to me to point not less clearly to an end than to an origin; to a creation, when [...] "the earth was without form and void," [...] and to a close, when it must either be renovated or destroyed.|$|E
60|$|Next morning James {{wandered in}} the Park, fresh and {{delightful}} with the rhododendrons; {{but the people}} he saw hurt him by their almost aggressive happiness--vivacious, cheerful, and careless, they were all evidently of opinion that no reasonable creature could complain {{with the best of}} all possible worlds. The girls that hurried past on ponies, or on bicycles up and down the well-kept road, gave him an impression of light-heartedness which was fascinating, yet made his own solitude more intolerable. Their cheeks glowed with <b>healthiness</b> in the summer air, and their gestures, their laughter, were charmingly animated. He noticed the smile which a slender Amazon gave to a man who raised his hat, and read suddenly in their eyes a happy, successful tenderness. Once, galloping towards him, he saw a woman who resembled Mrs. Wallace, and his heart stood still. He had an intense longing to behold her just once more, unseen of her; but he was mistaken. The rider approached and passed, and it was no one he knew.|$|E
60|$|It {{was within}} twenty hours {{of her last}} visit that I left this accursed ship. For a day none had come to feed or tend the slaves, and indeed many needed no tending, for they were dead. Some still lived however, though so far as I could see the {{most of them were}} smitten with the plague. I myself had escaped the sickness, perhaps because of the {{strength}} and natural <b>healthiness</b> of my body, which has always saved me from fevers and diseases, fortified as it was by the good food that I had obtained. But now I knew that I could not live long, indeed chained in this dreadful charnel-house I prayed for death to release me from the horrors of such existence. The day passed as before in sweltering heat, unbroken by any air or motion, and night came at last, made hideous by the barbarous ravings of the dying. But even there and then I slept and dreamed that I was walking with my love in the vale of Waveney.|$|E
60|$|He {{who listened}} {{while the other}} read was {{the master of the}} house, now {{emaciated}} in form and altered as to the expression and <b>healthiness</b> of his countenance, for his mind had dwelt too long among visionary thoughts and his body had been worn by imprisonment and stripes. The hale and weatherbeaten old man who sat beside him had sustained less injury from a far longer course of the same mode of life. In person he was tall and dignified, and, which alone would have made him hateful to the Puritans, his gray locks fell from beneath the broad-brimmed hat and rested on his shoulders. As the old man read the sacred page the snow drifted against the windows or eddied in at the crevices of the door, while a blast kept laughing in the chimney and the blaze leaped fiercely up to seek it. And sometimes, when the wind struck the hill at a certain angle and swept down by the cottage across the wintry plain, its voice was the most doleful that can be conceived; it came as if the past were speaking, as if the dead had contributed each a whisper, as if the desolation of ages were breathed in that one lamenting sound.|$|E
60|$|Vauvenargues {{showed his}} genuine <b>healthiness</b> not more by a plenary {{rejection}} {{of the doctrine of}} the incurable vileness and frenzy of man, than by his freedom from the boisterous and stupid transcendental optimism which has too many votaries in our time. He would not have men told that they are miserable earth-gnomes, the slaves of a black destiny, but he still placed them a good deal lower than the angels. For instance: 'We are too inattentive or too much occupied with ourselves, {{to get to the bottom}} of one another's characters; whoever has watched masks at a ball dancing together in a friendly manner, and joining hands without knowing who the others are, and then parting the moment afterwards never to meet again nor ever to regret, or be regretted, can form some idea of the world.'[48] But then, as he said elsewhere: 'We can be perfectly aware of our imperfection, without being humiliated by the sight. One of the noblest qualities of our nature is that we are able so easily to dispense with greater perfection.'[49] In all this we mark the large and rational humaneness of the new time, a tolerant and kindly and elevating estimate of men.|$|E
60|$|I cannot say I {{liked the}} very little I saw of Peru: in summer, however, {{it is said}} that the climate is much pleasanter. In all seasons, both {{inhabitants}} and foreigners suffer from severe attacks of ague. This disease is common on the whole coast of Peru, but is unknown in the interior. The attacks of illness which arise from miasma never fail to appear most mysterious. So difficult is it to judge from the aspect of a country, {{whether or not it is}} healthy, that if a person had been told to choose within the tropics a situation appearing favourable for health, very probably he would have named this coast. The plain round the outskirts of Callao is sparingly covered with a coarse grass, and in some parts there are a few stagnant, though very small, pools of water. The miasma, in all probability, arises from these: for the town of Arica was similarly circumstanced, and its <b>healthiness</b> was much improved by the drainage of some little pools. Miasma is not always produced by a luxuriant vegetation with an ardent climate; for many parts of Brazil, even where there are marshes and a rank vegetation, are much more healthy than this sterile coast of Peru. The densest forests in a temperate climate, as in Chiloe, do not seem in the slightest degree to affect the healthy condition of the atmosphere.|$|E
60|$|And even in {{the study}} of animals and their effects on the vegetation, {{questions}} of really deep interest will arise. You will find that certain plants and trees cannot thrive in a district, while others can, because the former are browsed down by cattle, or their seeds eaten by birds, and the latter are not; that certain seeds are carried in the coats of animals, or wafted abroad by winds--others are not; certain trees destroyed wholesale by insects, while others are not; that in a hundred ways the animal and vegetable life of a district act and react upon each other, and that the climate, the average temperature, the maximum and minimum temperatures, the rainfall, act on them, {{and in the case of}} the vegetation, are reacted on again by them. The diminution of rainfall by the destruction of forests, its increase by replanting them, and the effect of both on the <b>healthiness</b> or unhealthiness of a place--as in the case of the Mauritius, where a once healthy island has become pestilential, seemingly from the clearing away of the vegetation on the banks of streams--all this, though to study it deeply requires a fair knowledge of meteorology, and even of a science or two more, is surely well worth the attention of any educated man who is put in charge of the health and lives of human beings.|$|E
