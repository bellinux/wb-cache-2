5|$|An {{investigation}} {{found that a}} non-return valve in the fuel system had been installed the wrong way round causing two of the engines to be starved of <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> technician found responsible for incorrectly fitting the valve was charged under the Air Force Act. Following the accident, the non-return valve was re-designed so {{it could not be}} installed incorrectly.|$|E
5|$|The {{accident}} {{became the}} subject of an Inquiry chaired by a Supreme Court judge. In the absence of evidence indicating the source of any water in the <b>fuel,</b> <b>the</b> Inquiry dismissed the submission that water was responsible for the accident. The Inquiry did not determine the cause of the accident but it made recommendations to enhance the safety of aircraft operations.|$|E
5|$|The {{emergency}} services announced a major emergency at 06:08 and a fire fighting effort began.

25|$|The inverse is {{also true}} when the {{aircraft}} is in inverted flight. The float becomes submerged as <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> is pulled downward by gravity {{to the top of}} <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl. <b>The</b> float lifts upward toward the bottom of <b>the</b> inverted <b>fuel</b> bowl. With <b>the</b> float at the bottom of <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet valve opens, as it would when there is not enough <b>fuel</b> in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl. With <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> inlet valve open, <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump continues pumping <b>fuel</b> into <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> bowl, where <b>the</b> resulting excess <b>fuel</b> causes <b>the</b> fuel-air ratio to become lower than nine to one, which is then too rich for combustion to take place, stopping the engine.|$|R

5|$|A more {{immediate}} {{need for a}} canal covering the section between Givors and Rive-de-Gier emerged in the 1750s, when a cheaper method than pack mules was needed to carry coal to heat houses in Lyon and to <b>fuel</b> <b>the</b> glass works that had been opened in Givors in 1749. In 1751, there were 1,200 mules engaged in carrying the coal from Rive-de-Gier to Givors, from where it was taken by water north to Lyon and south to the towns of the Midi. Lyon was consuming 36,000 tons annually. The coal sold for 5 francs a ton at the mine head and 21.70 francs per ton at the Lyon docks.|$|E
5|$|A set {{of three}} {{animated}} videos, titled Tales from Dunwall, serving as a prequel to Dishonored, were released in September 2012. The videos show the discovery of whale-oil <b>fuel,</b> <b>the</b> Outsider granting his mark to a small boy in search of revenge, and Piero creating Corvo's mask. All three videos were created by animation studio Psyop and marketing firm Rokkan, narrated by ChloÃ« Grace Moretz, and scored by Daniel Licht. Each Tales from Dunwall episode received a gold Clio Award for achievement in advertising. In the same month, the game was used as inspiration for prosthetic makeup effects on the television reality show Face Off.|$|E
5|$|A third Saturn IB test, AS-203 {{launched}} from pad 37, went into orbit to support {{design of the}} S-IVB upper stage restart capability needed for the Saturn V. It carried a nosecone instead of the Apollo spacecraft, and its payload was the unburned liquid hydrogen <b>fuel,</b> <b>the</b> behavior of which engineers measured with temperature and pressure sensors, and a TV camera. This flight occurred on July 5, before AS-202, which was delayed because of problems getting the Apollo spacecraft ready for flight.|$|E

5|$|Archaea {{exhibit a}} great variety of {{chemical}} reactions in their metabolism and use many sources of energy. These reactions are classified into nutritional groups, depending on energy and carbon sources. Some archaea obtain energy from inorganic compounds such as sulfur or ammonia (they are lithotrophs). These include nitrifiers, methanogens and anaerobic methane oxidisers. In these reactions one compound passes electrons to another (in a redox reaction), releasing energy to <b>fuel</b> <b>the</b> cell's activities. One compound acts as an electron donor and one as an electron acceptor. The energy released is used to generate adenosine triphosphate (ATP) through chemiosmosis, the same basic process that happens in the mitochondrion of eukaryotic cells.|$|E
5|$|At {{the start}} of the war the Merlin I, II and III ran on the then {{standard}} 87 octane aviation spirit and could generate just over 1,000 horsepower (750kW) from its 27-litre (1,650-cuin) displacement: the maximum boost pressure at which the engine could be run using 87 octane fuel was +6 pounds per square inch (141kPa; 1.44atm). However, as early as 1938, at the 16th Paris Air Show, Rolls-Royce displayed two versions of the Merlin rated to use 100 octane <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> Merlin R.M.2M was capable of 1,265 horsepower (943kW) at 7,870 feet (2,400m), 1,285 horsepower (958kW) at 9,180 feet (2,800m) and 1,320 horsepower (984kW) on take-off; while a Merlin X with a two-speed supercharger in high gear generated 1,150 horsepower (857kW) at 15,400 feet (4,700m) and 1,160 horsepower (865kW) at 16,730 feet (5,100m).|$|E
5|$|By the 1990s {{crime rates}} started to drop {{dramatically}} due to revised police strategies, improving economic opportunities, gentrification, and new residents, both American transplants and new immigrants from Asia and Latin America. Murder rates that had reached 2,245 in 1990 plummeted to 537 by 2008, and the crack epidemic {{and its associated}} drug-related violence came under greater control.

5|$|Deep ecology is a {{movement}} founded by Arne Naess that establishes principles {{for the well-being of}} all life on Earth and the richness and diversity of life forms. The movement advocates, among other things, a substantial decrease in human population and consumption along with the reduction of human interference with the nonhuman world. To achieve this, deep ecologists advocate policies for basic economic, technological, and ideological structures that will {{improve the quality of life}} rather than the standard of living. Those who subscribe to these principles are obliged to make the necessary change happen. The concept of a billion-year Sustainocene has been developed to initiate policy consideration of an earth where human structures power and <b>fuel</b> <b>the</b> needs of that species (for example through artificial photosynthesis) allowing Rights of Nature.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{their failure}} to score any hits, the American torpedo attacks {{achieved}} three important results. First, they kept the Japanese carriers off balance and unable to prepare and launch their own counterstrike. Second, the poor control of the Japanese combat air patrol (CAP) meant {{they were out of}} position for subsequent attacks. Third, many of the Zeros ran low on ammunition and <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> appearance of a third torpedo plane attack from the southeast by VT-3 from Yorktown at 10:00 very quickly drew the majority of the Japanese CAP to the southeast quadrant of the fleet. Better discipline, and the employment of a greater number of Zeroes for the CAP might have enabled Nagumo to prevent (or at least mitigate) the damage caused by the coming American attacks.|$|E
5|$|Each Staffel was {{expected}} to make at least three firing passes. I./JG 3 took off and joined the lead Gruppe, IV Sturm./JG 3, with III./JG 3 following in the rear. The Bf 109s and Fw 190s of the Geschwader reached the area at about 09:20. Geschwaderkommodore Heinrich BÃ¤r led the attack. Some pilots made four passes, destroying AAA emplacements, fuel storage stations and vehicles. Nearly 300 aircraft were on the field, along with huge stores of equipment and <b>fuel.</b> <b>The</b> attack caused fires all over the airfield.|$|E
50|$|Most modern {{engines are}} {{equipped}} with fuel injection, and have an electric submersible <b>fuel</b> pump in <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> tank. Moving <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump to <b>the</b> interior of the tank helps prevent vapor lock, since <b>the</b> entire <b>fuel</b> delivery system is under positive pressure and <b>the</b> <b>fuel</b> pump runs cooler than if it {{is located in the}} engine compartment.
