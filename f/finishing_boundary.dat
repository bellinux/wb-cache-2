40|$|A {{comparison}} of Carbon Foot-print analysis (CFA) and Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) results was performed for the mayonnaise production system. The analysis enabled both the carbon footprint and wider environmental burdens {{of the system}} to be ascertained, together with {{an assessment of the}} extent to which the methodologies provide a consistent message concerning the relative contributions to the overall impacts of the system. Mayonnaise is an oil in water emulsion containing approximately 70 – 80 % fat (Depree and Savage (2001)). The type of oil used varies according to brand, with Kraft using predominantly soybean oil (www. kraftrecipes. com) and Hellmann’s using rapeseed oil (www. hellmanns. co. uk). This paper reports on the dual CFA and LCA performed using a rapeseed oil based mayonnaise as the end product, with the functional unit of ‘ 1 tonne of rapeseed oil mayonnaise produced in UK, packaged in 600 g jars, palletised and ready for distribution’. As a cradle to gate analysis, the <b>finishing</b> <b>boundary</b> was the mayonnaise packaging facility and no account was therefore taken of retail, use or disposal. Analysis was performed using SimaPro 7. 3. 2, with Life cycle impact assessment (LCIA) performed using IPCC (2007) and ReCiPe (2008) at both mid and endpoint levels. The carbon footprint of 1 tonne of packaged & palletised Mayonnaise was found to be 1. 95 tonne CO 2 e, with rapeseed oil providing the largest contribution, with 53. 89 % of the footprint. The next largest contributors were packaging glass and power consumption, with 21. 43 % and 13. 31 % of the footprint respectively. LCIA using ReCiPe(2008) revealed that at the endpoint level, the largest contributors to single score were again rapeseed oil, glass and power although the most significant impact category for each of these was fossil depletion, rather than climate change, which ranked second. Similarly, Climate change is not the most significant impact category when the normalised midpoint data was reviewed, with the toxicity and eutrophication categories showing as having far greater impacts. Midpoint analysis does however confirm rapeseed oil as the largest contributor of impacts. The analysis performed demonstrates that Climate change is not indicated as the most significant environmental burden at either the mid or endpoint stage when the full spectrum of environmental impacts are analysed within an LCA. However whether analysed using CFA or LCA, the contribution from rapeseed oil is highlighted as the most significant within the process. Thus, information from either study would result in impact reduction efforts being targeted consistently. References Depreee, J. A and Savage, G. P. 2001.

40|$|The {{friction}} and wear characteristics of thin diamond-like carbon (DLC) coatings {{have been investigated}} extensively in recent years mostly in laboratory bench tests. These coatings are known to provide significant friction reduction {{in the absence of}} lubricants. In the presence of lubricants, the friction benefits of these coatings are not clearly demonstrated. The current investigation is focused on exploring the friction reduction potential of a DLC coating obtained from a supplier in laboratory bench tests and in a motored valve train test. The DLC coating was deposited on the bucket tappet. In laboratory bench tests, results showed significant friction reduction {{in the absence of any}} lubricant but not in the presence of engine oil. In motored valve train tests a significant reduction in friction torque was observed when compared against a slightly rougher uncoated bucket, but no reduction was observed when compared against uncoated bucket tappet with comparable surface <b>finish.</b> Under <b>boundary</b> lubrication conditions, no lubricantderived surface films were present on the DLC-coated surface. However, under mixed lubrication conditions, evidence of patchy antiwear surface films could be observed on DLCcoated buckets. The antiwear film appears to be primarily composed of calcium phosphate...|$|R

The paper presents a comparison of main hygrothermal parameters of LHM-wall {{to those of other}} materials. Dry state and moist state are distinguished, as well as vapor and liquid transfer. Based on these parameters, {{it is not easy to}} foresee material’s response in terms of transient heat and mass transfer and storage under dynamic climates. Four combined parameters are defined, diffusivity and effusivity, on thermal and hygric points of view. Those parameters are related to thermal inertia and moisture regulation. If detailed transient hygrothermal analysis, considering the influence of <b>finishing</b> materials and <b>boundary</b> conditions applying to wall components, should be confirmed by dynamic software, the paper can help to choose appropriate materials in the early steps of design. LHM-wall offers increased comfort, high moisture regulation and indirect benefits on energy savings. Beside low impact on environment or health, it appears that transient hygrothermal behavior of LHM-wall components reinforce global sustainability of this innovative technology...|$|R

The findings and research contributions of this work are expected to provide a systematic guide to design intelligent and efficient textile finishes and lubricants. We studied boundary lubrication on model surfaces of common textile materials such as polypropylene (PP), polyethylene (PE), and cellulose. Thin films of these polymeric materials were made using the spin-coating method. The friction coefficient of the films was measured via lateral force microscopy (LFM) under three environmental conditions, in air, in water, and in lubricant solutions. The lubricant solution consisted of aqueous solutions of a PEO-PPO-PEO triblock copolymer commercially known as Pluronic (R) surfactants. LFM results indicated that when the lubricant was applied, PP and PE surfaces exhibited lower values of the friction coefficient than those on the cellulose specimen. This behavior was explained {{on the basis of}} the lubricant molecular configuration. It was determined that the PEO segment of the triblock copolymers had higher affinity towards the cellulose surface while the PPO segment exhibited a higher tendency to deposit on the PP and PE substrates. These differences in affinity were responsible for the diverse configurations of the triblock copolymer hence their lubrication performance. Unique molecular structures of the triblock copolymer were proposed including a buoy (PEO) -anchor (PPO) -buoy (PEO) structure on both PP and PE surfaces and an anchor (PEO) -buoy (PPO) -anchor (PEO) structure on cellulose. The improved lubrication performance of the triblock copolymer on the PP and PE surfaces was attributed to the flexibility of the PEO segments extending from the surface while the poor lubrication on the cellulose surface was attributed to the configuration of the PEO segments being anchored to the surface. Two important parameters, critical normal force and adhesion hysteresis, were found to correlate and to predict lubrication performace. High critical normal force and low values of adhesion hysteresis were good predictors of low friction coefficients. The reported findings are valuable to explain the behavior of finishing additives and lubricants commonly used in textile and fiber processing operations, as well as to relate the morphology of the adsorbed layers to friction and wear phenomena...|$|R
