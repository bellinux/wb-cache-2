40|$|Abstract: The <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> {{is a risky}} work {{where the}} fire fighters need to face the fire hazards to save life and properties. Different {{equipments}} such as fire extinguisher, axes and cutting equipment are used to fight against <b>fire.</b> <b>Fire</b> <b>fighting</b> vehicle {{is being used to}} transport firefighters to the scene as well as transport the <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> equipments. The <b>fire</b> fighter is still facing the risk of fire hazard because they still need to go near to fire scene. To reduce the fire fighter risk during fire incident, a <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> mobile robot is designed. <b>Fire</b> <b>fighting</b> mobile robot is a remote controlled machine that replace fire fighter to perform <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> task. The application of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> mobile robot is able to reduce the direct contact of fire fighter to the fire hazards. The paper reviews a variety of technologies and state-of-the-art technology of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> mobile robot.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the paper is to analyze the {{performance}} of a <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> system. Three basic parameters have been used during the simulation experiments: the number of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> stations, the speed of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> vehicles and the path coefficient (which represents the actual distances between the locations). Two performance criteria are chosen: the number of late arrivals, that is, the number of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> interventions in which vehicles exceed the maximum allowable travelling times to arrive at the fire locations, and the average travelling time of vehicles to arrive at the fire locations. Based on experimentation with the model (i. e. 550 different simulation runs) it is observed that the <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> system has a similar performance response for each experiment. <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> simulation location public sector...|$|R

This is intended to establish a better <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> system planning to be adopted in the management practice of University Technology Mara (Uitm) Shah Alam. The study has specific aim and objectives to achieve which is {{the main part of the}} research. The primary aim of this study is to understand the management of the <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> system in this institutional. Meanwhile, the second objective is to identify the awareness of the occupant about the importance of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> system in building and the third objective is to investigate the problem occurs for recommend a better approach in managing <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> system UITM Shah Alam. This dissertation includes the outlines of the introduction to the subject and each subtopic, and also explanation about <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> management systems in UITM Shah Alam. Research methodologies which apply are through literature review, observation, questionnaire survey to the students and staff, and interview session with mechanical engineer in facilities management department. Then, data analysis and findings are based on literature review, research method and additional outsource references. From analysis, it can be found that the management of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> systems for UITM Shah Alam are moderate and the knowledge about <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> among student and staff are lack. Finally, conclusion and recommendation is made according to research findings. <b>Fire</b> <b>fighting</b> or maintenance management department should re-examine about step and method to accomplish this <b>fire</b> <b>fighting...</b>|$|R

40|$|Abstract. {{historical}} {{performance of}} <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> and rescue force represents {{a series of}} comprehensive characteristics derived from the analysis of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> and rescue response data and related safety indexes over a given time period. The research and analysis of a city’s historical performance of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> and rescue force will provide a valuable basis and reference for the planning and evaluation of the city’s <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> and rescue force layout. In this paper, the author proposes a historical performance evaluation index system of city <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> and rescue force based on fire response time, fire truck & appliances dispatched and firefighters dispatched, along with evaluation mode and approach.

A principal source of such difficulties is the phenomenon of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> the unplanned allocation of resources to fix problems discovered late in a product's development cycle. While it has been widely criticized, <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> is a common occurrence in many product development organizations. To understand both its existence and persistence, in this article I develop a formal model of <b>fire</b> <b>fighting</b> in a multi-project development environment.
