As {{one of the few remaining}} founding members of Fatah, he had some degree of credibility within the Palestinian cause, and his candidacy was bolstered by the fact that other high-profile Palestinians were for various reasons not suitable (the most notable, Marwan Barghouti, was a prisoner in Israeli jail after having been convicted on charges of being responsible for multiple murders by an Israeli court). Abbas's reputation as a pragmatist garnered him favor with the West and some members of the Palestinian legislature. Under international pressure, on 19 March 2003, Arafat appointed Abbas Prime Minister of the Palestinian National Authority. According to Gilbert Achcar, the United States imposed Abbas on Arafat, the democratically elected leader, though the majority of Palestinians thought of the former as a Quisling.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Leadership plays {{a crucial}} role in teams working in complex environments, and {{research}} has shown that shared leadership where all team members perform leadership functions is an effective strategy. The authors aimed to describe shared leadership patterns during anaesthesia induction and show how they are linked to team performance. METHODS: 12 anaesthesia teams consisting of one resident and one nurse during a simulated anaesthesia induction including a non-routine event (asystole) were videotaped, and two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> behaviour (content-oriented and structuring) were coded. Team performance was operationalised as the reaction time to the non-routine event. The amount <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> sharedness was compared between low- and high-performing teams by performing a univariate analysis of variance. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used to analyse the distribution <b>of</b> the two <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> behaviour among team members. RESULTS: Statistical analysis revealed that in high-performing teams, residents and nurses shared their leadership, while in low-performing teams, residents showed significantly higher levels <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> behaviour than nurses. Further analyses revealed different distributions <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> functions among team members. While residents of low-performing teams assumed both <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> behaviour, members <b>of</b> high-performing teams seemed to have distinct leadership roles: nurses mainly used content-oriented leadership behaviour, and residents tended to show structuring leadership behaviour. CONCLUSIONS: The study documents the effectiveness <b>of</b> shared <b>leadership</b> in situations with high task complexity and indicates that a clear distribution of content-oriented and structuring leadership among team members is an effective strategy. The findings have implications for training in shared leadership and also give rise to a number of recommendations for further research.

40|$|AbstractThe role <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> in the {{improvement}} {{of teaching and learning}} has long been established in the literature. In recent years, there has been a proliferation of attempts to influence (or lead) classroom teachers, especially in the areas of science and mathematics. What remains unclear and somewhat contentious however, is what <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> matter for {{the improvement}} of learning and achievement in schools. This paper presents findings from a large-scale, qualitative research project on the <b>leadership</b> practices <b>of</b> 102 successful schools serving formerly disadvantaged children in South Africa. Data from a rich set of interviews with school administrators and subject specialists, document analysis, and school observations suggest that the more successful schools, in the group, distinguish themselves in the way they define and construct the overall goals <b>of</b> <b>leadership</b> around instruction and have developed fairly elaborate structures and processes for monitoring instruction (especially in mathematics and science). Using the framework <b>of</b> distributed <b>leadership,</b> we develop an account <b>of</b> how <b>leadership</b> for instructional improvement is constructed in the more successful schools in South Africa. We conclude the paper by puzzling over the rather strained (or non-existent) relationship between leadership and instruction in most (South African) schools, and explore why improvements in school achievement are rather rare among such schools serving the poor and (formerly) disadvantaged learners...|$|R
