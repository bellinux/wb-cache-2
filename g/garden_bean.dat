40|$|Developmental time, parasitism, emergence, longevity, {{fecundity}} {{and demographic}} parameters of population of Encarsia bimaculata Heraty and Polaszek (Hymenoptera: Aphelinidae), a parasitoid attacking Bemisia tabaci (biotype B) (Gennadius) (Homoptera: Aleyrodidae) infesting soybean, Glyine max L. (Merr), cowpea, Vigna unguiulata L. and <b>garden</b> <b>bean,</b> Phaseolus vulgaris L. (Fabeles: Fabaceae) were quantified and compared. Encarsia bimaculata {{was able to}} complete its life cycle independent of the B. tabaci instar parasitized. However, parasitoid development was significantly slower when first (19 d), second (15 d) instars or pharate adults (14 d) were parasitized compared to the third (13 d) or fourth (13 d) instars. Consequently, percent parasitism was higher when the third (51 %) or fourth (46 %) instars were parasitized compared to the first (22 %), second (25 %) instars or pharate adults (36 %) of B. tabaci. Similarly, percent parasitoid emergence was significantly higher when third (83 %) or fourth (76 %) instars were parasitized compared to when the first (34 %), second (64 %) or pharate adults (54 %) were parasitized. Host plant species significantly influenced egg to adult developmental time, percent parasitism and the day on which E. bimaculata nymphs hatching from eggs was first observed. More nymphs were parasitized on cowpea (40 %) followed by <b>garden</b> <b>bean</b> (36 %) and soybean (32 %), while percent hatching was significantly higher on soybean (76 %) followed by cowpea (68 %) and <b>garden</b> <b>bean</b> (42 %). Adult parasitoid females lived an average of 6. 7 d on soybean, 7. 6 d on cowpea and 7. 2 d on <b>garden</b> <b>bean</b> and laid a lifetime average of 27 eggs on soybean, 31 eggs on cowpea and 30 eggs on <b>garden</b> <b>bean.</b> The daily mean fecundity of E. bimaculata was not significantly different on the three bean species. Life table parameters showed that the net reproductive rate (Ro) was 14. 50, generation time (Tc) was 17. 16, intrinsic {{rate of natural increase}} (rm) was 0. 16, finite rate of growth (λ) was 1. 17 and doubling time (Td) was 4. 44 for parasitoids on soybean. On cowpea, Ro was 15. 32, Tc was 18. 59, rm was 0. 15, λ was 1. 16 and Td was 4. 72, while, on <b>garden</b> <b>bean,</b> Ro was 8. 95, Tc was 19. 28, rm was 0. 11, λ was 1. 12 and Td was 6. 08.

40|$|Infections of wound {{sites on}} dicot plants by Agrobacterium tumefaciens {{result in the}} {{formation}} of crown gall tumors. An early step in tumor formation is bacterial attachment to the plant cells. AttR mutants failed to attach to wound sites of both legumes and nonlegumes and were avirulent on both groups of plants. AttR mutants also failed to attach to the root epidermis and root hairs of nonlegumes and had a markedly reduced ability to colonize the roots of these plants. However, AttR mutants were able to attach to the root epidermis and root hairs of alfalfa, <b>garden</b> <b>bean,</b> and pea. The mutant showed little reduction in its ability to colonize these roots. Thus, A. tumefaciens appears to possess two systems for binding to plant cells. One system is AttR dependent and is required for virulence on all of the plants tested and for colonization of the roots of all of the plants tested except legumes. Attachment to root hairs through this system can be blocked by the acetylated capsular polysaccharide. The second system is AttR independent, is not inhibited by the acetylated capsular polysaccharide, and allows the bacteria to bind to the roots of legumes...|$|E

One mole of C-II inhibited one mole each of bovine trypsin and bovine ar-chymo-trypsin, probably at the same site, and porcine elastase at another reactive site. In the ordinary assay system D- 1 I and E-I inhibited only trypsin activity at a non-stoichiometric inhibitor-enzyme ratio of 1 : 1. 4, and the complexes had rather high dissociation constants.

Strategic {{changes in the}} food environment might therefore be potential measures to influence consumers' food selection towards better nutrition, without affecting the consumers' freedom of choice. The present study aimed to examine whether increased vegetable variety enhances healthy food choices and improves meal composition. Design A randomised experiment. Setting Participants were instructed to serve themselves a lunch from a buffet of food replicas. Individuals {{were randomly assigned to}} one of three food combinations: condition A - cooked carrots, pasta and chicken; condition B - cooked green <b>garden</b> <b>beans,</b> pasta and chicken; condition AB - carrot sticks, green <b>garden</b> <b>beans,</b> pasta and chicken. Two one-vegetable conditions were compared with one two-vegetable condition. Data from Zurich, Switzerland, were analysed using one-way ANOVA. Subjects Ninety-eight students (fifty-three men; mean age 22 · 8 (sd 2 · 2) years, minimum = 19 years, maximum = 29 years). Results Participants who could choose from two vegetables derived significantly more energy (141 kJ) from vegetables compared with participants in the one-vegetable condition (104 and 84 kJ, respectively). Furthermore, in the two-vegetable condition, the relative energy of the meal derived from vegetables (10 · 9 %) increased significantly compared with the one-vegetable condition (8 % and 6 · 1 %, respectively). The total energy content of the meal (mean 1472 (sd 468) kJ) was not affected by the experimental manipulation. Conclusions Having a choice of vegetables increases a person's tendency to choose vegetables and leads to the selection of a more balanced meal.

40|$|Protease C 1, {{an enzyme}} from soybean (Glycine max [L. ] Merrill cv Amsoy 71) {{seedling}} cotyledons, was previously {{determined to be}} the enzyme responsible for the initial degradation of the alpha' and alpha subunits, but not the beta subunit, of beta-conglycinin storage protein. The sizes of the proteolytic products generated {{by the action of}} protease C 1 suggest that the cleavage sites on the alpha' and alpha subunits of beta-conglycinin may be located in their N-terminal domain, which is not found in the beta subunit of beta-conglycinin. To check this hypothesis, storage proteins from other plant species that are homologous to either the alpha'/alpha or the beta subunit of beta-conglycinin were tested as substrates. As expected, the convicilin from pea (Pisum sativum), a protein homologous to the alpha' and alpha subunits of beta-conglycinin, was digested by protease C 1. The vicilins from pea as well as vicilins from adzuki bean (Vigna angularis), <b>garden</b> <b>bean</b> (Phaseolus vulgaris), black-eyed pea (Vigna unguiculata), and mung bean (Vigna radiata), storage proteins that are homologous to the beta subunit of soybean beta-conglycinin, were not degraded by protease C 1. Degradation of soybean beta-conglycinin involves a sequential attack of the alpha subunit at multiple sites, culminating in the formation of a stable intermediate of 53. 5 kD and a final product of 48. 0 kD. The cleavage sites resulting in this formation of the intermediates and final product were determined by N-terminal analysis.
