50|$|Estrogen and {{progesterone}} typically regulate {{motivation to}} engage in sexual reproduction behaviour for <b>females</b> <b>in</b> mammalian species, though the relationship between hormones and female sexual reproduction motivation is not as well understood. In particular, estrogens {{have been shown to}} correlate positively with increases <b>in</b> <b>female</b> sexual reproduction motivation, and progesterone has been associated with decreases <b>in</b> <b>female</b> sexual reproduction motivation. The periovulatory period of the female menstrual cycle is often associated with increased female receptivity and sexual reproduction motivation.

40|$|This paper uncovers a counter-intuitive {{effect of}} {{international}} trade on female labor shares: whenever trade expands, sectors intensive <b>in</b> <b>female</b> labor, female labor shares drop and vice versa. According to our key assumption a rising capital labor ratio closes the gender wage gap. The paper’s mechanism operates as follows. Expansions of sectors intensive <b>in</b> <b>female</b> labor come along with contractions of sectors intensive in male labor. These contractions imply that male labor reallocates to sectors intensive <b>in</b> <b>female</b> labor. The capital labor ratio in the latter sectors drops, which widens the gender wage gap and causes a decrease <b>in</b> aggregate <b>female</b> labor shares. Based on instrumented U.
