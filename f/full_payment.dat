5|$|Eureka was {{published}} in a small hardcover edition in March 1848 by Wiley & Putnam priced at 75 cents. Poe persuaded George Palmer Putnam, who had previously taken a chance on Poe by printing his only novel The Narrative of Arthur Gordon Pym of Nantucket in England, to publish Eureka after claiming this work {{was more important than}} Isaac Newton's discovery of gravity. Putnam paid Poe fourteen dollars for the work. Poe suggested an initial printing of at least one million copies; Putnam settled on 750, of which 500 were sold that year. Other accounts say that Poe requested 50,000 copies, and 500 were printed. Poe was given in advance the <b>full</b> <b>payment</b> of $14 from the publisher.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey's {{ordination}} as {{a priest}} took place at Southwell on 23 September 1189, in a ceremony performed by John the Bishop of Whithorn. Geoffrey then went to York, but until his election was ratified by the pope he refused to allow Burchard to take up his office. This stance was supported {{by most of the}} York cathedral chapter. Geoffrey then was sent by Richard to escort William the Lion from Scotland to Canterbury. It was at Canterbury that papal assent to Geoffrey's election was secured in December, when Giovanni d'Anagni, the papal legate, not only confirmed the election, but rejected the various appeals made by the cathedral chapter against Geoffrey. But the king forced Geoffrey to allow the royal appointments, and pay a fine of £2000 before his lands were restored, although Geoffrey was allowed some time to make the <b>full</b> <b>payment.</b>|$|E
5|$|News that Marc Anthony was {{recording}} an English-language album {{began in}} 1996 when RMM executive Ralph Mercado mentioned the possibility following a joint-venture between RMM (Anthony's former record label) and MCA Records. Anthony {{said that he}} would not record in English until he felt he was ready to do so. After the release of his third studio album Contra la Corriente in 1997, disputes over business practices arose between him and Mercado. Anthony suspected that he was not receiving <b>full</b> <b>payment</b> from his record label for his recordings. Mercado would not allow Anthony to leave the record label because his contract committed Anthony to record four more albums for RMM.|$|E

5|$|The {{suggestion}} that the entire amount of the purchase money was not paid, and that such fact is {{in the way of}} supporting the claim to the Indian title, is not sustained. We are not called upon to consider the effect of default in payment of any portion of the purchase money. The treaty recites the payment of it, and as no such question seems ever before to have been raised, or <b>full</b> <b>payment</b> questioned, either by government or the Indians, it must at this late day be assumed, until the contrary is quite clearly made to appear, that the contract in that respect was performed.|$|E
5|$|In 1990, facing {{financial}} collapse, Bain & Company asked Romney to return. Announced as its new CEO in January 1991, he drew {{a symbolic}} salary of one dollar (remaining managing general partner of Bain Capital during this time). He oversaw an effort to restructure Bain & Company's employee stock-ownership plan and real-estate deals, while rallying the firm's one thousand employees, imposing a new governing structure that excluded Bain and the other founding partners from control, and increasing fiscal transparency. He got Bain and other initial owners who had removed excessive amounts of money from the firm to return substantial amounts, and persuaded creditors, including the Federal Deposit Insurance Corporation, to accept less than <b>full</b> <b>payment.</b> Within about a year, he had led Bain & Company to a return to profitability. He turned Bain & Company over to new leadership and returned to Bain Capital in December 1992.|$|E
5|$|In early 1190 Geoffrey {{ordered a}} halt to {{religious}} ceremonies in the cathedral and excommunicated Henry Marshal and Burchard in retaliation for a dispute during an earlier church service. Richard, who was in Normandy preparing {{to go on the}} Third Crusade, ordered Geoffrey to the king's presence in Normandy. Although Hugh du Puiset, who was Justiciar, was hampering Geoffrey's attempts to collect revenue for the earlier fine, Richard insisted on immediate <b>full</b> <b>payment.</b> When Geoffrey was unable to pay Richard re-confiscated his lands, increased the amount of the fine, and demanded a promise that Geoffrey would not visit England for three years. The dispute was settled once more when the pope stepped in and ratified Geoffrey's election, thus enabling a reconciliation between the king and the archbishop at Tours in June. Geoffrey's estates were returned to him in July, after paying 800 marks of his fine.|$|E

5000|$|To {{cushion the}} high copay costs of brand name drugs, some {{pharmaceutical}} companies offer drug coupons or temporary subsidized copayment reduction programs lasting from {{two months to}} twelve months. Thereafter, if a patient is still taking the brand name medication, the pharmaceutical companies might remove the option and require <b>full</b> <b>payments.</b> If no similar drug is available, the patient is [...] "locked in" [...] to either using the drug with the high copays, or a patient takes no drugs and lives {{with the consequences of}} non-treatment.|$|R
50|$|Brian Hall, {{along with}} the other petitioners, had made <b>full</b> <b>payments</b> into Social Security accounts. They were {{therefore}} automatically entitled into Medicare. However, they did not invoke its use and preferred their own private health insurance. However, statutes allowed this only if they also gave up Social Security, and they did not wish to also cancel their Social Security benefits. The courts ultimately ruled that since they were not required to use their Medicare benefits, they could not be allowed to cancel Medicare coverage without also cancelling Social Security benefits.|$|R
25|$|On October 8, 1917, a {{resolution}} was passed to divide a section into lots for family use and to issue certificates of purchase {{at the time}} the <b>full</b> <b>payment</b> was received.

25|$|Although timber barons orchestrate {{the illicit}} operations, {{including}} export, their operations are financed by international sources. This financing {{comes in the}} form of down payments of up to half the total sale from foreign buyers and loans from international banks that have branches in Antananarivo. The loans are critical, even in such a profitable industry, because without <b>full</b> <b>payment,</b> most of the capital gets tied up in the stockpiles of logs waiting to be exported.|$|E

25|$|With {{this action}} on August 30, 1888, Candler's sole control became {{technically}} all true. Candler had negotiated with Margaret Dozier {{and her brother}} Woolfolk Walker a <b>full</b> <b>payment</b> amounting to $1,000, which all agreed Candler could pay off {{with a series of}} notes over a specified time span. By May 1, 1889, Candler was now claiming full ownership of the Coca-Cola beverage, with a total investment outlay by Candler for the drink enterprise over the years amounting to $2,300.|$|E
25|$|Medicare sets a {{schedule}} of fees, called the Medicare Benefits Schedule (MBS). The standard Medicare rebate is 100% of a general practitioner and 85% of a specialist schedule fee. Where medical practitioners bill Medicare directly ("bulk bill"), they agree with Medicare to accept 85% of the schedule fee in <b>full</b> <b>payment</b> for their services. Many medical practitioners bulk bill pensioner patients, and some bulk bill all of their patients. In the three months to July 2016, 85.9% of GP visits were bulk billed, which fell to 85.4% {{in the three months}} to September 2016.|$|E
25|$|In March 2016, the Ministry of Transport issued new {{regulations}} for parking in locations {{with access to}} the general public. The new parking regulations, that go into effect on January 1, 2017, terminated the free parking for zero-emission vehicles, but established that Municipalities can introduce payment exemption for electric and hydrogen powered motor vehicles on municipal parking locations. , the city councils of Trondheim and Tønsberg decided to introduce <b>full</b> <b>payment</b> for EVs from 2017; the cities of Bodø and Tromsø will introduce payment for parking in downton but exempted parking outside the city's center; and the cities of Oslo, Mandal and Drammen decided to keep free parking for zero-emission vehicles.|$|E
25|$|The Social Security Administration's {{authority}} to make benefit payments as granted by Congress extends only to its current revenues and existing Trust Fund balance, i.e., redemption of its holdings of Treasury securities. Therefore, Social Security's ability to make <b>full</b> <b>payments</b> once annual benefits exceed revenues depends {{in part on the}} federal government's ability to make good on the bonds that it has issued to the Social Security trust funds. As with any other federal obligation, the federal government's ability to repay Social Security is based on its power to tax and borrow and the commitment of Congress to meet its obligations.|$|R
50|$|The key {{difference}} between a biweekly mortgage payment plan and a traditional mortgage payment plan is that instead of making 12 <b>full</b> <b>payments</b> each year, 26 half payments--the equivalent of 13 full payments--are made each year. On a biweekly mortgage payment plan, some months will require 3 payments or 1 and one half traditional payments. Finance companies use this pattern to their advantage. Finance companies charge interest on a per diem basis instead of monthly. The consumer's repayment is scheduled on a monthly basis. This allows the finance companies to collect an additional 2 weeks of interest every year. Paying biweekly payments allows consumers to eliminate the additional accrued interest charges.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model-based {{technique}} for lowering the entrance barrier for service providers to register services with a marketplace broker, {{such that the}} service is rapidly configured to utilize the broker’s local service delivery management components. Specifically, it uses process modeling for supporting the execution steps of a service and shows how service delivery functions (e. g. payment points) “local ” to a service broker can be correctly configured into the process model. By formalizing the different operations in a service delivery function (like payment or settlement) and their allowable execution sequences (<b>full</b> <b>payments</b> must follow partial payments), including crossfunction dependencies, it shows how through tool support, the non-technical user can quickly configure service delivery functions in a consistent and complete way. 1...|$|R
25|$|Tensions soon arose {{between the}} two parties. Batticaloa was the {{traditional}} port of the Kandyan kingdom (Trincomalee had long been lost, first to the Jaffna kingdom {{and then to the}} Portuguese), and Rajasingha was eager to acquire it as soon as possible. The Dutch, however, demurred, demanding <b>full</b> <b>payment</b> for their assistance in displacing the Portuguese. Despite a rising suspicion that the Dutch were not in Sri Lanka to expel the Portuguese, so much as to replace them, the alliance was one that was too valuable for Rajasingha to simply cancel, and joint Dutch–Kandyan efforts resulted in the seizure of Galle on 13 March 1640 and the restriction of Portuguese power to the west coast of Sri Lanka by 1641.|$|E

Everywhere he went he compelled the Chinese to pay. He says that all his native Christians are now provided for. He had 700 of them under his charge, and 300 were killed.
