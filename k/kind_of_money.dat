5|$|A fairly {{peculiar}} economic phenomenon {{occurred during}} the war in that the Confederate government issued both regular money notes and interest-bearing money, although the United States did issue Interest Bearing Notes during the war that were legal tender for most financial transactions. The circulation of the interest-bearing money and the convertibility of one <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> into the other was enforced by fiat and Southern banks were threatened with a return to the gold standard if they did not cooperate. Because of the amount of Southern debt held by foreigners, to ease currency convertibility, in 1863 the Confederate Congress decided to adopt the gold standard, although actual convertibility was not to come into effect until 1879 (hence the law never went into effect, being supplanted by the Coinage Act of 1873 {{and the end of the}} Confederacy).|$|E

40|$|The law of reflux is {{explained}} using an example <b>of</b> backed <b>money.</b> In the example, government-issued money {{is backed by}} the government’s assets (mainly taxes receivable) while bank-issued money is backed by the bank’s assets. The value <b>of</b> both <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> {{is determined by the}} amount of backing held per unit <b>of</b> <b>money</b> issued. The example shows that reflux maintains money’s value, not by assuring that excessive issues <b>of</b> <b>money</b> reflux to their issuers, but by providing people with access to the assets backing their money. Conventional metallic convertibility is only one channel of many through which money can reflux to its issuer. The suspension of metallic convertibility still leaves many other open channels of reflux, but can create the illusion that money is unbacked fiat money that was somehow forced into circulation. Backed money will hold its value as long as its issuer remains solvent. One way for an issuer to stay solvent is to issue money in exchange for short-term real bills of adequate value, but as long as the bills are of adequate value, it is largely unnecessary for the bills to be real or short-term. ...|$|R

40|$|Three {{experiments}} {{were carried out}} to investigate people's concept <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> In the first experiment, {{subjects were asked to}} rate items for their typicality as money, and subsequently to say, as quickly as possible, whether or not those items were 'a <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> money'. Subjects were quicker to categorize the more typical instances. In the second experiment, subjects were asked to rate the similarities between pairs of instances <b>of</b> the <b>money</b> concept. The mean ratings were well described by a single-link cluster analysis whose structure was dominated by the factor of typicality. These two {{experiments were}} both carried out in England. The third experiment was conducted in both England and the Netherlands, and was preceded by a postal questionnaire aiming to identify items which were widely agreed to be instances <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> It combined the manipulations of the first two experiments, and the same patterns of categorization times and similarity ratings were found. In addition, multidimensional scaling showed that typical value is an important dimension in determining the similarities between <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>money.</b> There were interpretable differences in the similarity ratings between the English and Dutch samples. The three experiments show that money is a typical 'polymorphous concept', that is, a concept whose definition and boundaries cannot be specified precisely, but which nonetheless can be used consistently and efficiently. © 1992...|$|R

In December 1960, he sold Stroma to James Simpson, an islander whose family had moved to farm on the mainland near the Castle of Mey in 1943.

40|$|Beyond its obvious {{macro-economic}} relevance, fiat {{money has}} important micro-economic implications. They matter for addressing No. 8 in Smale's "Mathematical Problems for the Next Century": extend the mathematical model of general equilibrium theory to include price adjustments. In the canonical Arrow-Debreu framework, equilibrium prices are set by a fictitious auctioneer. Removing that fiction {{raises the question}} of how prices are set and adjusted by decentralised actors with incomplete information. We investigate this question through a very basic model where a unique factor of production, labour, produces a single consumption good, called jelly for brevity. The point of the model is to study a price dynamics based on the firm's expectations about jelly demand and labour supply. The system tends towards economic equilibrium, however, depending on the initial conditions it might not get there. In different model versions, different <b>kinds</b> <b>of</b> <b>money</b> are introduced. Compared to the case <b>of</b> no <b>money,</b> the introduction <b>of</b> <b>money</b> as a store of value facilitates the system reaching economic equilibrium. If money is introduced as a third commodity, i. e. there is also a demand for money, the system dynamics in general becomes more complex...|$|R
