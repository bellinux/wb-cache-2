40|$|From {{microscopic}} observations, it {{was established}} that an oil-in-water emulsion with droplets {{of a size}} in the micrometer range can spontaneously form at room temperature without additional external stirring {{as soon as a}} solvent that is only partly miscible to water-like dichloromethane (DCM) is put in contact with an aqueous mixture of polyethylene glycol (PEG) and a protein. Experimental results show that emulsification only occurs if the system simultaneously includes PEG with middle chain, an organic solvent partly miscible to water and for which PEG affinity is sufficiently high, and a protein. From adsorption kinetics, it appears that this spontaneous emulsification process is related to the rapid diffusion of DCM towards water through the formation of <b>interfacial</b> <b>turbulences,</b> once the accumulation of PEG close to the DCM/water interface occurs. The oil droplets formed would be then stabilized by adsorbed protein molecules. Since the presence of polylactic acid in the organic phase did not prevent the emulsion formation, we studied the feasibility of formulating microparticles using this polymer. From results, it appears that microcapsules with a polymeric shell, with a homogeneous size of about 50 microm and able to encapsulate a model hydrophobic drug, such as amiodarone, can be obtained by using this spontaneous emulsification method...|$|R

The measurements included distributions of void fraction, bubble count rate, <b>interfacial</b> velocity, <b>turbulence</b> intensity, bubble chord sizes, and integral turbulent length and time scales which were scaled with a 2 : 1 undistorted geometric scaling ratio. The criterion selection for scale effects is a critical issue. Major differences (i. e. scale effects) were observed in terms of bubble count rates, bubble chord sizes, turbulence levels and integral turbulent length scales although little scale effects were seen in terms of void fraction and velocity distributions. The findings suggested that most physical results, including the rate of energy dissipation and re-aeration, cannot be extrapolated to prototype flow conditions without significant scale effects.

In the basic transport equations, interfacial area concentration is transported by averaged interfacial velocity In the previous models, interfacial velocity is roughly approximated by velocity of each phase. In the present model, interfacial velocity is rigorously formulated in term of spatial correlation functions of characteristic function and velocity of each phase and their directional derivatives.

The modeling has been carried out within the OpenFOAM framework and a two-phase Eulerian approach has been chosen. The code can be used to predict the distribution of the local ow parameters, i. e. the void fraction, the bubble diameter, the velocity of both liquid and gas, the turbulent intensity as well as the liquid temperature. Special attention has been devoted to the phenomena which govern the void fraction distribution in the radial direction. Two di erent solvers have been implemented and the simulations have been performed in two dimensions. Firstly, isothermal turbulent bubbly ow is mechanistically modeled in a solver named myTwoPhaseEulerFoa-mAdiabatic. The conservation equations of mass and momentum are solved for the two phases, taking special care in the modeling of the <b>interfacial</b> forces. The <b>turbulence</b> phenomena are described by a classical k- model in combination with standard wall functions for the near-wall treatment. Furthermore, an interfacial area concentration equation is solved and two di erent models for its sink- and source terms (corresponding to bubble coalesence and bubble breakup) have been investigated. Secondly, a solver named myTwoPhaseEulerFoamBoiling has been developed based on the rst solver in order to model a heated wall leading to subcooled nucleate boiling and subsequent condensation in the subcooled liquid. Additional terms accounting for the phase change have been included in the mass and momentum conservation equations {{as well as in the}} interfacial area equation.

The predictions obtained from myTwoPhaseEulerFoam-Boiling have been compared to the DEBORA experimental data base. They are qualitatively similar but rather high quantitative discrepancies exist. Grid dependence tests revealed that the latter solver depends on the near-wall grid resolution, a yet unresolved issue related to the application of the wall heat ux as the boundary condition.

The present study is focused on new measurements of air-water turbulent time and length scales in air-water flow using several phase-detection intrusive probes. A new signal processing method and some correlation analyses were developed and applied. The air water flow properties presented basic characteristics that were qualitatively and quantitatively comparable to previous studies in skimming flows. Some self-similarity was observed systematically at both macroscopic and microscopic levels. This included the distributions of void fraction, bubble count rate, <b>interfacial</b> velocity and <b>turbulence</b> level at a macroscopic scale, and the bubble/droplet chord distributions, and the auto- and cross-correlation functions at a microscopic level. Self-similarity is closely linked with dynamic similarity, and present results demonstrated a number of self-similar relationships that remain invariant under changes of scale which led in turn to remarkable application at prototype scales. The present findings are significant because they provide a picture general enough {{to be used as}} a first approximation to characterise the air-water flow field in similar stepped spillway structures. The correlation analyses yielded a characterisation of the large eddies advecting the bubbles. The basic results included the transverse and streamwise integral turbulent length scales, the transverse and streamwise integral turbulent time scales, and the advection length scale. The turbulent length scales characterised a measure of the size of large vortical structures advecting air bubbles in the skimming flows. Both streamwise and transverse air-water length scales were closely related to the characteristic air-water depth Y 90 : i. e., Lxy/Y 90 = 0. 05 to 0. 2.

In this upper spray, the distributions of droplet chord sizes and the distributions of advection length scales presented some marked difference with the rest of the flow.

40|$|Current {{knowledge}} in high-velocity self-aerated flows continues {{to rely upon}} physical modelling. Herein a miniature total pressure probe was successfully used in both clear-water and air-water flow regions of high-velocity open channel flows on a steep stepped channel. The measurements were conducted in a large size facility (θ= 45 °, h= 0. 1  m, W= 0. 985  m) and they were complemented by detailed clear-water and air-water flow measurements using a Prandtl-Pitot tube and dual-tip phase-detection probe respectively in both developing and fully-developed flow regions for Reynolds numbers within 3. 3 × 10 to 8. 7 × 10. Upstream of the inception point of free-surface aeration, the clear-water developing flow was characterised by a developing turbulent boundary layer and an ideal-flow region above. The boundary layer flow presented large total pressure fluctuations and turbulence intensities, with distributions of turbulence intensity close to intermediate roughness flow data sets: i. e., intermediate between d-type and k-type. The total pressure measurements were validated in the highly-aerated turbulent shear region, since the total pressure predictions based upon simultaneously-measured void fraction and velocity data agreed well with experimental results recorded by the total pressure probe. The results demonstrated the suitability of miniature total pressure probe in both monophase and two-phase flows. Both interfacial and water phase turbulence intensities were recorded. Present findings indicated that the turbulence intensity in the water phase was smaller than the <b>interfacial</b> <b>turbulence</b> intensity...|$|E
40|$|This paper reports {{turbulent}} {{boundary layer}} measurements made over open-cell reticulated foams with varying pore size and thickness, but constant porosity (ϵ≈ 0. 97). The foams were flush-mounted into a cutout on a flat plate. A Laser Doppler Velocimeter (LDV) {{was used to measure}} mean streamwise velocity and turbulence intensity immediately upstream of the porous section, and at multiple measurement stations along the porous substrate. The friction Reynolds number upstream of the porous section was Re_τ≈ 1690. For all but the thickest foam tested, the internal boundary layer was fully developed by 30 % of the free stream velocity) and a mean velocity deficit relative to the canonical smooth-wall profile further from the wall. While the magnitude of the mean velocity deficit increased with average pore size, the slip velocity remained approximately constant. Fits to the mean velocity profile suggest that the logarithmic region is shifted relative to a smooth wall, and that this shift increases with pore size until it becomes comparable to substrate thickness h. For all foams, the turbulence intensity was found to be elevated further into the boundary layer to y/ δ≈ 0. 2. An outer peak in intensity was also evident for the largest pore sizes. Velocity spectra indicate that this outer peak is associated with large-scale structures resembling Kelvin-Helmholtz vortices that have streamwise length scale 2 δ- 4 δ. Skewness profiles suggest that these large-scale structures may have an amplitude-modulating effect on the <b>interfacial</b> <b>turbulence...</b>|$|E
40|$|Poly(d,l-lactic acid) (PLA) {{nanoparticles}} {{were prepared}} by a modified emulsification-diffusion technique. The preparation method consisted of emulsifying {{a solution of}} polymer in an aqueous solution of a stabilizing agent, previously saturated, followed by diluting the internal phase with an excess of water. Propylene carbonate (PC) {{was used as a}} partially water-miscible solvent, due to its ability to dissolve polymers, its low toxicity and its ease of emulsification. PC allowed the obtention of nanospheres in a reproducible and efficient way, using poly(vinyl alcohol) or poloxamer 188 as stabilizing agents. The possibility of using poloxamer 188 to produce PLA nanospheres is an interesting option because of its well known acceptability for parenteral administration. With other well accepted stabilizing agents such as polysorbate 80, gelatin, polyvinylpyrrolidone and dextran, {{it was not possible to}} obtain nanoparticles. The effectiveness of the stabilizing agents in the process was attributed to their ability to avoid coalescence during PC diffusion. The formation mechanism of nanoparticles can be explained by the large interfacial area resulting from emulsification and the gradual reduction of the globule size due to solvent transfer and probably, to the <b>interfacial</b> <b>turbulence</b> generated during diffusion. A higher concentration of polymer was found to rapidly increase the size and polydispersity of nanoparticles. In contrast, an increase in stirring rate and concentration of stabilizer agent were found to reduce moderately the size of the nanoparticles. Other process parameters such as viscosity, pH of the external phase and internal/external phase ratio had limited influence on particle size...|$|E
40|$|A {{hydraulic}} jump is {{the transition from}} a supercritical open channel flow to a subcritical regime. It is characterised by a highly turbulent flow with macro-scale vortices, some kinetic energy dissipation and a bubbly two-phase flow structure. New air-water flow measurements were performed in {{hydraulic jump}} flows for a range of inflow Froude numbers. The experiments were conducted in a large-size facility using two types of phase-detection intrusive probes: i. e., single-tip and double-tip conductivity probes. These were complemented by some measurements of free-surface fluctuations using ultrasonic displacement meters. The present study was focused on the turbulence characteristics of hydraulic jumps with partially-developed inflow conditions. The void fraction measurements showed the presence of an advective diffusion shear layer in which the void fractions profiles matched closely an analytical solution of the advective diffusion equation for air bubbles. The present results highlighted some influence of the inflow Froude number onto the air bubble entrainment process. At the largest Froude numbers, the advected air bubbles were more thoroughly dispersed vertically, and larger amount of air bubbles were detected in the turbulent shear layer. In the air-water mixing layer, the maximum void fraction and bubble count rate data showed some longitudinal decay function in the flow direction. Such trends were previously reported in the literature. The measurements of <b>interfacial</b> velocity and <b>turbulence</b> level distributions provided new information on the turbulent velocity field in the highly-aerated shear region. The present data suggested some longitudinal decay of the turbulence intensity. The velocity profiles tended to follow a wall jet flow pattern. The air–water turbulent time and length scales were deduced from some auto- and cross-correlation analyses based upon the method of CHANSON (2006, 2007). The results provided the integral turbulent time and length scales of the eddy structures advecting the air bubbles in the developing shear layer. The experimental data showed that the auto-correlation time scale Txx was larger than the transverse cross-correlation time scale Txz. The integral turbulence length scale Lxz was a function of the inflow conditions, of the streamwise position (x-x 1) /d 1 and vertical elevation y/d 1. Herein the dimensionless integral turbulent length scale Lxz/d 1 was closely related to the inflow depth: i. e., Lxz/d 1 = 0. 2 to 0. 8, with Lxz increasing towards the free-surface. The free-surface fluctuations measurements showed large turbulent fluctuations that reflected the dynamic, unsteady structure of the hydraulic jumps. A linear relationship was found between the normalized maximum free-surface fluctuation and the inflow Froude number...|$|R
40|$|This study {{explores the}} {{interfacial}} and heat transfer characteristics of annular condensation of FC- 72 in vertical downflow, vertical upflow and horizontal flow {{as well as}} the effects of channel orientation on flow condensation. Two separate condensation test modules are employed, one for high-speed video imaging of the film interface and the second for heat transfer measurements. Condensation in both test modules is achieved by rejecting the heat to a counterflow of cooling water. The heat transfer measurements are obtained along the inner wall of an 11. 89 -mm i. d. and 1, 259. 84 -mm long stainless steel tube. ^ For vertical downflow, the film at very low FC- 72 flow rates is observed to be both smooth and laminar. The film turns turbulent with a very wavy interface as the flow rate of FC- 72 is increased, especially for exit film Reynolds numbers above 1, 800. The heat transfer coefficient decreases axially because of a gradual thickening of the liquid film. However, the data show a downstream minimum before the heat transfer coefficient increases again towards the outlet as the film transitions to turbulent flow, enhanced by the more intense downstream waves. A control-volume-based model is proposed, which incorporates an eddy diffusivity profile for the liquid film that accounts for <b>interfacial</b> dampening of <b>turbulence</b> due to surface tension. The model shows good accuracy in predicting the average condensation heat transfer coefficient data, evidenced by a mean absolute error of 12. 59 %. ^ Upflow condensation is complicated by the relative magnitude of the opposing vapor shear and gravity. This study also examined the different flow regimes for condensation of FC- 72 in vertical upflow. Four regimes are identified, falling film, where the condensing film drains downwards by gravity opposite to low velocity vapor flow, oscillating film, corresponding to film flow oscillating between upwards and downwards, flooding, where film begins to be sheared upwards by the vapor core, and climbing film, where high vapor velocity causes the film to be sheared upwards. The four flow regimes are well segregated in a flow regime map based on dimensionless superficial velocities of the vapor and liquid. The condensation heat transfer coefficient is shown to decrease axially because of gradual thickening of the film, except for high mass velocities, where <b>turbulence</b> and intensified <b>interfacial</b> waviness cause downstream heat transfer enhancement. The annular flow model is modified to account for the reversed orientation of gravity, and shows fair predictions for the climbing film regime. The predictive accuracy of the model is influenced by flow oscillations occurring downstream of the climbing film region and inability of the model to account for interfacial waves. ^ For condensation of FC- 72 in horizontal tubes, dominant condensation flow regimes are identified for different combination of mass velocities of FC- 72 and cooling water using high-speed video motion analysis [...] Additionally, detailed heat transfer measurements are used to explore both axial and circumferential variations of the condensation heat transfer coefficient. Four different regimes are identified: stratified, stratified-wavy, wavy-annular with gravity influence, and wavy-annular without gravity influence. In the latter regime, which is achieved at high FC- 72 mass velocities, annular film transport is dominated by vapor shear with negligible gravity effects. Using different types of regime maps, prior relations for transitions between regimes are assessed, and new, more accurate transition relations developed. The heat transfer coefficient is shown to be highest near the inlet, where quality is near unity and the film thinnest, and decreases gradually along the condensation length because of axial thickening of the liquid film. This study also explores the predictive capabilities of prior heat transfer correlations and a control-volume-based annular flow model. The experimental data of both the local and average condensation heat transfer coefficients show fair to good agreement with predictions of prior and popular correlations. But superior predictions in both trend and magnitude are achieved with the annular flow model. ^ The study of orientation effects on flow condensation explores condensation of FC- 72 in a circular tube at three different flow orientations including horizontal flow, vertical downflow, and vertical upflow with the aid of detailed heat transfer measurements and high-speed video motion analysis. Using the video analysis, the behavior of liquid film and influence of gravity are investigated for different combinations of mass velocity of FC- 72 and cooling water for three flow orientations. Utilizing the condensation module for heat transfer measurements, axial and circumferential variations of the condensation heat transfer coefficient for different flow orientations are explored. Local and average condensation heat transfer coefficients from the three flow orientations are compared to each other to assess the influence of body force on condensation heat transfer. Flow conditions that negate the influence of body force are identified. Using the annular flow model, the magnitudes of different forces acting on the liquid film are compared to each other for different combinations of mass velocity of FC- 72 and cooling water for each orientation. ...|$|R
40|$|An {{experimental}} {{investigation was}} performed to evaluate convective condensation and evaporation of R 22, R 32 and R 410 A inside a smooth tube (inner diameter 11. 43 mm), a herringbone tube (fin root diameter 11. 43 mm) and a newly developed enhanced surface EHT tube (inner diameter 11. 5 mm) at low mass fluxes. The inner surface of the EHT tube is enhanced by dimple/protrusion and secondary petal arrays. For condensation, the heat transfer coefficient of the herringbone tube is 2. 0 - 3. 0 times larger than a smooth tube and the EHT tube is 1. 3 - 1. 95 {{times that of the}} smooth tube. The heat transfer enhancement ratios of the herringbone tube and the EHT tube are larger than their respective inner surface area ratios. Mass flux has a non-monotonic relation with the condensation heat transfer coefficient in the herringbone microfin tubes; this was especially evident for R 32 and R 410 A. For evaporation, the EHT tube provides the best evaporation heat transfer performance for all the three refrigerants; this is mainly due to the heat transfer enhancement produced from the larger number of nucleation sites, increased <b>interfacial</b> <b>turbulence,</b> boundary layer disruption, flow separation and secondary flow generation caused by the dimple and petal arrays. The evaporation heat transfer coefficient of the herringbone tube is only slightly higher than that of the smooth tube. Overall, the EHT tube provides increased heat transfer enhancement for both condensation and evaporation. (C) 2015 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|E
