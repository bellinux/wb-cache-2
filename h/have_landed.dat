5|$|On 24 March, Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak {{appeared}} before media at 22:00 local {{time to give}} a statement regarding Flight 370, during which {{he announced that he}} had been briefed by the Air Accidents Investigation Branch that it and Inmarsat (the satellite data provider) had concluded that the airliner's last position before it disappeared was in the southern Indian Ocean. As there were no places there where it could <b>have</b> <b>landed,</b> the aircraft must therefore have crashed into the sea.|$|E
5|$|The Montana {{class would}} have used {{aircraft}} for reconnaissance and for gunnery spotting. The type of aircraft used would have depended on when exactly the battleships would have been commissioned, but in all probability they {{would have used}} either the Kingfisher or the Seahawk. The aircraft would have been floatplanes launched from catapults on the ship's fantail. They would <b>have</b> <b>landed</b> {{on the water and}} taxied to the stern of the ship to be lifted by a crane back to the catapult.|$|E
5|$|The first {{document}} {{mentioning the}} existence of this community is the town charter granted by Mathieu d'Alsace in 1181 to Gerard de Guelders, Count of Boulogne; Calais thus became part of the county of Boulogne.

5|$|In 2007, a {{memorial}} stone was erected at Black River, Jamaica, near where Zong would <b>have</b> <b>landed.</b> A sailing ship representing Zong was sailed to Tower Bridge in London in March 2007 {{to commemorate the}} 200th anniversary of the Act for the Abolition of the Slave Trade, {{at a cost of}} £300,000. The vessel housed depictions of the Zong massacre and the slave trade. It was accompanied by HMS Northumberland, with an exhibition on board commemorating the role of the Royal Navy after 1807 in the suppression of the slave trade.|$|E
5|$|Lt Col Newman {{aboard the}} MGB need not <b>have</b> <b>landed,</b> {{but he was}} one of the first ashore. One of his first actions was to direct mortar fire onto a gun {{position}} on top of the submarine pens that was causing heavy casualties among the Commandos. He next directed machine-gun fire onto an armed trawler, which was forced to withdraw upriver. Newman organised a defence that succeeded in keeping the increasing numbers of German reinforcements at bay until the demolition parties had completed their tasks.|$|E
5|$|New York City actress Ash ("Liz") Sroka voices Tali {{throughout}} the Mass Effect trilogy, her first {{role in a}} video game. Sroka auditioned for three different roles: the female Commander Shepard, Tali'Zorah, and one other female character. After initially receiving the role of Tali, she was still unsure of how much material there was. Ginny McSwain gave voice direction, and would generally take two takes—the first to use, the second as back-up, and occasionally a third or more if the recording did not fit with what she wanted. Recording sessions would generally last about four hours. Sroka herself is not a gamer, though she says she enjoys the character of Tali and is happy to <b>have</b> <b>landed</b> the role.|$|E

5|$|Several {{missions}} were {{proposed to}} demonstrate methods of landing the Gemini spacecraft on land. The spacecraft {{had originally been}} designed to land using a paraglider {{and a set of}} skis or wheels, however this was abandoned in favor of splashdowns under parachutes due to delays in development and failures during testing. As the proposed Big Gemini spacecraft would <b>have</b> <b>landed</b> this way, McDonnell Aircraft asked NASA to consider flying standard Gemini spacecraft with the paraglider in order to test the system before it would be required operationally.|$|E
5|$|The Muslim {{presence}} in Gibraltar began on 27 April 711 when the Berber general Tariq ibn-Ziyad led the initial incursion into Iberia {{in advance of}} the main Moorish force under the command of Musa ibn Nusayr, Umayyad governor of Ifriqiya. Gibraltar was named after Tariq, who was traditionally said to <b>have</b> <b>landed</b> on the shores of the Rock of Gibraltar, though it seems more likely that he landed somewhere nearby. Muslim sources claimed that Tariq established some kind of fortification on the Rock, but no evidence has been found and it is not considered credible. It was not until 1160 that a first fortified settlement was built there.|$|E
5|$|Another {{proposed}} spacecraft, the Gemini Lunar Surface Survival Shelter, {{was designed}} to be sent to the Moon ahead of an Apollo mission. It would <b>have</b> <b>landed</b> close to the planned Apollo landing site, and if the Apollo Lunar Module's ascent stage failed to ignite, the crew would have performed an EVA to transfer to the LSSS. The shelter was not designed to take off again after landing, so an LSRS or another Apollo mission would then be sent to collect the crew, whilst the Command Module Pilot of the original Apollo mission would have returned to Earth alone aboard his spacecraft. It consisted of a Gemini Reentry Module, which would have housed the astronauts whilst they awaited rescue, and a descent stage containing life support systems, consumables, and the engine and propellant used to land the spacecraft.|$|E

5|$|Back on Guam, 3rd Battalion began {{training}} for a landing on Miyako Jima, an island just south of Okinawa. Those orders were eventually cancelled, but the battalion still saw minor combat in 1945, participating in two operations on Guam designed to capture Japanese soldiers still holding out in the hills. These sweeps took place in April and December 1945. 3rd Battalion also began preparing for Operation Olympic, where as part of V Amphibious Corps, it would <b>have</b> <b>landed</b> at Kushikino, Kagoshima on Kyūshū. After the dropping of the atomic bombs in August 1945, and Japan's surrender, 3rd Battalion was detached from the 3rd Marine Division in November 1945 and deactivated the following month on 12 December 1945. Shortly before it was deactivated, however, 3rd Battalion suffered the dubious honor of having the last American killed in World War II, when PFC W.C. Patrick Bates of Kilo Company was shot by a Japanese sniper on 14 December during a mopping up operation on Guam (three months after the formal end of hostilities).|$|E
5|$|On 26 March 2003, 954 {{soldiers}} of the 173d Airborne Brigade conducted a combat jump from C-17 aircraft onto Bashur Airfield in Northern Iraq {{under the command of}} Colonel Mayville. The jump took a total of 58seconds, though 32 paratroopers were unable to jump because they would <b>have</b> <b>landed</b> too far {{from the rest of the}} force. The force had been strung out over a 10,000-yard drop zone, and it took 15 hours before it was completely assembled. In the weeks before there had been heavy rain and the mud created problems for those doing the jump. The paratroopers secured the airfield, allowing the C-17s to land and bring in the heavy armor and the 1–63d Armor contingents. They jumped from aircraft of the 62d Airlift Wing and the 728th Airlift Squadron, along with an element of USAF Airmen from the 786th Security Forces Squadron. Over the next 96 hours, the wing landed in the remaining 1,200 {{soldiers of}} the brigade as well as their vehicles. By 29 March the entire brigade was in Iraq and ready to conduct offensive operations.|$|E
5|$|The Gemini Lunar Surface Rescue Spacecraft was {{intended}} to fly a direct ascent mission, launched by a Saturn V. Descent stages, built from either the descent stage of the Apollo Lunar Module, or from the Apollo Service Module, would have reduced the spacecraft's velocity as it approached the Moon. One configuration used two Service Modules and one LEM descent stage, with the LEM descent stage performing the final landing, and then being reused for ascent from the Lunar surface and trans-Earth injection. The other configuration used three LEM descent stages, with the second being used for landing and the third for ascent and TEI. The LSRS would <b>have</b> <b>landed</b> close to the Apollo Lunar Module on the Moon, and the Apollo crew would have transferred to it by EVA.|$|E

5|$|Now {{that the}} war in Europe was over, plans were made to form an {{airborne}} corps comprising the 6th Airborne Division and 44th Indian Airborne Division for service against Japanese forces in the Far East. The corps would be used in operations to recapture Malaya and Singapore. The division's advance party, based partly on the 5th Parachute Brigade, arrived in India in July 1945. The brigade travelled ahead {{of the rest of the}} division as it had been intended to use them for Operation Zipper, an independent mission in Burma. They would <b>have</b> <b>landed</b> in Malaya, between Singapore and the Japanese forces in Burma. Reinforcements would then arrive by sea and attack northwards and southwards, while the brigade carried out another airborne landing on Singapore itself. However, following the Japanese surrender, all these plans changed, and the remainder of the 6th Airborne Division were sent to Palestine. Instead of carrying out an airborne landing, the 5th Parachute Brigade travelled by sea, leaving Bombay on 9 September and arriving at Morib in Malaya on 17 September. Only the 7th and 12th Parachute battalions landed, and they re-embarked the next day to sail for Singapore as part of Operation Tiderace; they arrived on 21 September. The brigade, now part of XV Corps, became the island's garrison. In December the 23rd Indian Infantry Division was sent from Seremban to Java, and the brigade was moved to replace them.|$|E
