40|$|Recent {{literature}} {{has estimated that}} the 2003 dividend tax cut caused a large increase in aggregate <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts,</b> which would imply that dividend taxation creates large efficiency costs relative {{to the amount of}} revenue raised. I document that <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts</b> by real estate investment trusts also rose sharply following the tax cut, even though REIT dividends did not qualify for the cut. Using REITs as a control group in a simple difference-in-differences framework produces small and statistically insignificant estimates of the effect of the tax cut on aggregate <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts.</b> I further document that the ratio of <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts</b> to corporate earnings changed little after the tax cut, and that the ratio of <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts</b> to share repurchases fell dramatically.

The results control for other variables that may potentially affect dividend payments such as growth opportunity, debt, profitability, firm size and firm age. From agency theory perspective, the finding is consistent with the argument that family controlling shareholders prefer lower dividends, in order to preserve cash flows that they can potentially expropriate (the expropriation hypothesis) ...|$|R

40|$|I {{examine whether}} {{and to what}} extent tax {{uncertainty}} affects a firm's <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts.</b> Based on the argument that tax uncertainty impairs the persistence and predictability of after-tax cash flows, I hypothesize and find that firms with greater tax uncertainty exhibit a lower probability of <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts.</b> The effect of tax uncertainty is stronger in the presence of financial constraints and weaker for firms that distribute dividends to alleviate agency conflicts. Furthermore, I find a negative effect of tax uncertainty on dividend levels, which is moderated by the costs of dividend reductions. These results are economically meaningful as a one standard deviation higher tax uncertainty leads to a 9. 9 percentage point lower probability and a $ 23. 6 million reduction in <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts.</b> Taken together, my findings document a real effect of tax avoidance and contribute to the understanding of interactions between uncertain tax avoidance and a firm's financial ecosystem.

40|$|This paper {{focuses on}} a type of firms that have been {{traditionally}} neglected in both family business and governance research, namely, family-controlled, publicly-listed firms. Although principal-agent conflicts may be less prevalent in such firms, family control can potentially give rise to principal-principal conflicts, leading to expropriation of the wealth of minority owners by family owners. Superior firm performance and the willingness to distribute the profits through dividend payments would suggest {{the absence of such}} expropriation. Based on a sample of 210 OTC firms in Japan, we examined the relationships between family control and <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts</b> and profitability.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the relationship between}} corporate governance quality and dividend policy in Canada. Based on the agency theory predictions, we consider the effect of two conflicting hypotheses {{about the effect of}} corporate governance on dividend payouts: the outcome and substitution hypotheses. The effectiveness of firm-level governance mechanisms is assessed through the "Globe" & "Mail" annual corporate governance index and four sub-categories scores (board composition, shareholding and compensation issues, shareholder rights issues and corporate governance disclosure policy). Using a sample of 714 firm-years listed on the Toronto Stock Exchange over the period 2002 - 2005, our results show that firms with stronger corporate governance have higher <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts.</b> Among the four components of the corporate governance index, we document that board composition and shareholder rights' policy are positively related to payout ratios. We also find a positive association between firm size, the level of free cash flows and <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts.</b> Finally, we document a negative relationship between firm risk, US cross-listing and <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts.</b> Taken together our results are consistent with the outcome model of dividend policy.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{attempts}} a firm-level {{study of}} financialisation in the Indian context. In {{the last few}} decades, many {{studies have shown that}} financialisation or the increased dominance of the financial sector tends to have a profound and mostly negative impact of real sector growth and accumulation. The consequent declining real investment and accumulation is likely to affect future growth adversely along with employment and income levels. This study attempts a firm level look at financialisation and real capital accumulation, using data on companies constituting the SENSEX. We use the Least squares dummy variable model (LSDV) model for the short panel data to analyses if the impact of financialisation as estimated by <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts</b> and rentier shares on real capital accumulation is significant. The paper contributes to the existing literature in two ways: first, by introducing a microeconomic perspective on financialisation especially in the context of firms who are likely to be affected by financialisation and secondly, by introducing both <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts</b> along with rentier shares as independent variables representing financialisation. The paper finds a negative impact of financialisation as reflected in higher <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts</b> and increasing rentier shares on real capital accumulation, suggesting there is a likely tradeoff between shareholder orientation and real capital accumulation. This implies that increasing rentier shares and <b>dividend</b> <b>payouts</b> affect negatively real capital accumulation which may lead to future growth being compromised. It is pertinent for firms to have a balance between shareholder value and long-run growth of the firm for which real capital accumulation will be important...|$|R
