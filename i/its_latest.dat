5|$|Although the Rose Room {{was removed}} from the Algonquin in a 1998 remodel, the hotel paid tribute to the group by {{commissioning}} and hanging the painting A Vicious Circle by Natalie Ascencios, depicting the Round Table and also created a replica of the original table.

5|$|Immigration {{became an}} {{important}} issue for the Vlaams Blok from the late 1980s. Interconnected with the Flemish nationalism issue, immigrants {{were considered to be}} a threat to the Flemish ethnic community. In 1992, the party established its 70-point plan, which included measures to stop all immigration, return most immigrants to their native countries by force, and legally discriminate against residing migrants in respect of markets such as labour, housing and education. The party's opponents particularly saw its immigration program as a source of claims of racism, and the party thus in <b>its</b> <b>latest</b> years downplayed the relevance of the 70-point plan, and softened its written positions regarding immigration.|$|E

5|$|Parallel to NDRE's work, NTNF {{was working}} with ESRO to gain support for a {{telemetry}} station. There was a degree of urgency as ESRO wanted the facility completed by 1967 {{in time for the}} launch of the spacecraft ESRO-2. NTNF and ESRO were also working on the establishment of Kongsfjord Telemetry Station in Ny-Ålesund. The agreement to build the station was approved by the Parliament of Norway in mid 1966. Part of the reason for the Norwegian support was the opportunity of training Norwegians in pulse-code modulation and digital computing. For NDRE the station was a chance to apply <b>its</b> <b>latest</b> minicomputer, the Simulation for Automatic Machinery (SAM).|$|E

5|$|An {{operation}} {{to expose the}} Erdman Gang leads to the recruitment of Southern, a British Secret Service agent, who is assigned to infiltrate the organisation and leak intelligence on <b>its</b> <b>latest</b> scheme. The gang leader contacts the undercover Southern and Erdman operatives Dempsey and Kenyon at Glen Carrick Castle in the Scottish Highlands, and briefs them on their mission. The trio are {{to drive to the}} Nuclear Plutonium Store, where isotopes for all Britain's power stations are housed, and plant explosives to detonate at 12:30p.m.; this will cause a nuclear explosion of unprecedented scale and devastate half of England. To ensure compliance, the charges, which have already been armed, are contained in wrist bracelets identical to Prescott's and are to be unlocked on retrieval of the key at the Plutonium Store.|$|E

Portugal still has many tough years ahead. During the crisis, Portugal's government debt increased from 93 to 139 percent of GDP. On 3 August 2014, Banco de Portugal announced the country's second biggest bank Banco Espirito Santo would be split in two after losing the equivalent of $4.8 billion in the first 6 months of 2014, sending its shares down by 89 percent.|$|E
5|$|The {{radicals}} refused, however, {{to recognize}} {{themselves in the}} novel's pages (Dimitri Pisarev ridiculed the notion that Raskolnikov's ideas could be identified {{with those of the}} radicals of his time), since Dostoyevsky pursued nihilistic ideas to their most extreme consequences. The aim of these ideas was altruistic and humanitarian, but these aims were to be achieved by relying on reason and suppressing entirely the spontaneous outflow of Christian pity and compassion. Chernyshevsky's utilitarian ethic proposed that thought and will in Man were subject to the laws of physical science.* Hudspith (2003), 95 Dostoyevsky believed that such ideas limited man to a product of physics, chemistry and biology, negating spontaneous emotional responses. In <b>its</b> <b>latest</b> variety of Bazarovism, Russian nihilism encouraged the creation of an élite of superior individuals to whom the hopes of the future were to be entrusted.|$|E
5|$|The {{winners were}} {{announced}} during the awards ceremony on March 24, 2002.

Denzel Washington {{was the second}} African-American to win Best Actor in a Leading Role, following Sidney Poitier for 1963's Lilies of the Field. Halle Berry became the first African-American to win Best Actress in a Leading Role.

5|$|Utilities {{and other}} {{services}} also have significantly changed since 1990. Fairbanks Memorial Hospital was renovated and expanded in 1976, 1985, 1995, and 2000. In 2009, the hospital opened a new heart care center during <b>its</b> <b>latest</b> expansion. Bassett Army Hospital on Fort Wainwright went through a $132 million renovation in 2005. To meet the demand for a convention center and large sporting arena, the city paid for construction of the Carlson Center, a 5,000-seat arena that opened in 1990. In 1996, the city of Fairbanks privatized its utilities when the Municipal Utilities Service was sold to a private company. About $74 million from the sale was deposited into a savings account called the Fairbanks Permanent Fund, which was invested and managed in a fashion similar to the Alaska Permanent Fund, though residents do not receive any income from the Fairbanks Permanent Fund.|$|E
5|$|What this {{effectively}} did was {{shift the}} bombing campaign southwestward to the Ho Chi Minh Trail. The interdiction {{campaign against the}} enemy logistics corridor was massively expanded due to the increased number of U.S. aircraft (approximately 500 planes) made available by the closure of Rolling Thunder. By November 1968 bombing missions over southern Laos had climbed by 300 percent, from 4,700 sorties in October to 12,800 in November. By {{the end of the}} conflict, U.S. and South Vietnamese aircraft would drop over three million tons of ordnance on Laos, three times the total tonnage dropped on North Vietnam. The new campaign against the trail was unprecedented, and not just due to the numbers sorties flown or munitions expended. The U.S. was going to field <b>its</b> <b>latest</b> technology in its attempt to prevent the North Vietnamese from toppling the South Vietnamese government.|$|E
