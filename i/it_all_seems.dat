25|$|With the Salon d'Automne of {{that same}} year, 1911, the fury broke out again, just as violent {{as it had been}} at the Indépendants. I {{remember}} this Room 8 in the Grand Palais on the opening day. People were crushed together, shouting, laughing, calling for our heads. And what had we hung? Metzinger his lovely canvas entitled Le Goûter; Léger his sombre Nus dans un Paysage; Le Fauconnier, landscapes done in the Savoie; myself La Chasse and the Portrait de Jacques Nayral. How distant <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> now! But I can still see the crowd gathering together in the doors of the room, pushing at those who were already pressed into it, wanting to get in to see for themselves the monsters that we were.|$|E
500|$|James Panero, {{reviewer}} for The New York Times, called Street Gang a [...] "behind {{the lens}} story" [...] and the [...] "first comprehensive account" [...] of Sesame Street. [...] Panero found Davis' history tireless, but objected to Davis' emphasis on unimportant details. [...] As a result, {{and due to}} Davis' inclusion of every anecdote and biography of everyone involved with its creation and history, Panero considers the book an oral history rather than a tightly organized narrative. [...] Other reviewers note that Street Gang is too much like its subject, episodic and unfocused. [...] Diana Wagman of The L.A. Times states that Davis choice of what to focus on is odd; for example, {{there is a great}} deal of focus in the book on things like the licensing and merchandising agreement of the Muppets, but very little attention on Mississippi's 1970 ban of the show. [...] Wagman states, [...] "Yes, we get a little past-tense womanizing, a lot of drinking and a psychotic breakdown later in the book, but <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> sad, not salacious, and not germane to the basic story". [...] Nick Gillespie of The Washington Post agrees. [...] He calls Jim Henson, who is mentioned often in the book, [...] "an almost completely enigmatic character".|$|E
500|$|The Edge of Glory was {{met with}} general acclaim from critics. While {{previewing}} the song Matthew Perpetua from Rolling Stone wrote a positive review: [...] "This one sounds crazy in print , but somehow <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> totally natural when you actually hear it." [...] Perpetua added {{that there is an}} element of cheesiness in the song, but nevertheless, it is captivating and catchy when one listens to it. He complimented the inclusion of Clemons as an [...] "inspired touch that amplifies the song's Eighties stadium rock vibe," [...] and Clemons' actual performance was described as amazing and among the best of his career. In another review, Perpetua noted that [...] "The Edge of Glory" [...] is [...] "an immediate pop anthem". Fellow Rolling Stone journalist Jody Rosen complimented the hook, the chorus and Clemens' saxophone playing on the song. Jocelyn Vena from MTV News asserted that the song showed a softer side to Gaga, as opposed to her previous singles from Born This Way. Willa Paskin from New York was impressed with the track, saying: [...] "If the first two tracks off the forthcoming Born This Way were all jangly dance-rock, this is as smooth as an '80s jam straight off the Flashdance soundtrack, and it has the saxophone breakdown to prove it." [...] Paskin also believed that the song had potential to be a summer hit, but could face competition from singer Katy Perry's single, [...] "Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)".|$|E
60|$|Alvina {{sank down}} and laughed till she was weak. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> really too funny to her--too funny.|$|R
6000|$|... 'If I wasn't real,' Alice said--half-laughing {{through her}} tears, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> so ridiculous--'I shouldn't {{be able to}} cry.' ...|$|R
5000|$|Margaret Lockwood said [...] "We {{had to do}} {{nine days}} of retakes to satisfy the censor on that film and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> very foolish." ...|$|R
500|$|Mars first {{performed}} the song live on Saturday Night Live on October 20, 2012. His performance was well received by critics. Rolling Stone magazine wrote, [...] "With a little oomph, a whole lotta shimmy-shimmy-ya {{and a few}} hip swivels, Bruno's ska-bop jam was given new life. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> so effortless; so cool and fresh; pop performances don't often fall ahead of the curve, but this one does." [...] Sam Lansky of Idolator praised the performance, writing that [...] "Mars turned {{it out on the}} show, with an energetic rendition of 'Locked Out of Heaven' backed by a fleet of impeccably choreographed dancers." [...] A live performance was also done on The X Factor UK, on November 25, 2012. On December 4, Mars performed on the [...] Victoria's Secret Fashion Show, aired on CBS. His performance happened during the Calendar Girls. On the December 8, 2012, Mars performed in the 2012 edition of Jingle Bell Ball at The O2 Arena in London. On December 13, he performed again live on the FOX reality television singing competition, The X Factor. Mars also {{performed the}} song with Sting at 2013 Grammy Awards, joined later by Rihanna, Ziggy Marley and Damian Marley to pay tribute to reggae legend Bob Marley. It was the either the played as the twelfth or fifteenth track on the set list of his second worldwide tour, the Moonshine Jungle Tour (2013-14). On February 2, 2014 the single was featured as the third number in the mini-set medley, in the halftime performance of Super Bowl XLVIII at MetLife Stadium in New Jersey. On his third worldwide tour, the 24K Magic World Tour (2017-18), [...] "Locked Out of Heaven" [...] was the fourteenth or fifteenth track of the setlist, in the latter case sang as an encore.|$|E
2500|$|Billy Corgan {{has said}} that he was {{inspired}} to write a story based 'the Fool's Journey' from the Tarot. [...] Corgan has explained his interpretation of this view: [...] "There's childlike innocence when you just don't really know anything in the world and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> sort of big and magical...the teen, aware but not really liking what's going on...the third person that's cynical, where you get kind of bitter because you feel so small and there's all these things that are sort of happening and there's not much you can do about it...the fourth stage out of that would be finding a sort of spiritual place within yourself where you can live in reality, you can see it for what it is, but maybe you can find a deeper source of inspiration and peace." [...] In other words, the album finds Corgan [...] "looking past, present and future {{all at the same time}} and trying to have that perspective".|$|E
60|$|I don't {{know any}} longer what's right and what's wrong. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> confused. It's very hard.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Darling did {{not know}} what to think, for <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> so natural to Wendy that you could not dismiss it by saying she had been dreaming.|$|R
6000|$|Jim {{struggled}} to his elbow {{and looked around}} him. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> {{to come back to}} him. [...] "Did he do it fair?" [...] he demanded of his companions.|$|R
60|$|Again he sighed. She {{noted the}} weary, patient {{look in his}} face, the bent shoulders, the labor-gnarled hands, and <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to symbolize the {{futility}} of his social creed.|$|R
6000|$|... "I do not--I cannot deny it; I {{never saw}} my own conduct in this {{criminal}} light before, and yet now <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> frightfully true!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That is {{the story}} of the old chest. It was all over so long ago--the heartbreak and the misery--but <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> to come back to me now. Poor Eliza!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear me!" [...] {{said the}} Angel; [...] "There's deer and a stag! Just as they draw {{them on the}} coats of arms. How {{grotesque}} <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems!</b> Can I really be awake?" ...|$|E
60|$|Irene still met him, he was certain; where, or how, he neither knew, nor asked; deterred by a {{vague and}} secret dread {{of too much}} knowledge. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> {{subterranean}} nowadays.|$|R
60|$|Ursula had {{her nose}} out of joint. She {{wanted to go}} away now. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> no good. Hermione was {{established}} for ever, she herself was ephemeral and had not yet even arrived.|$|R
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> different, at {{once more}} real {{and not so}} jumbled together, now that she used her own eyes instead of the {{guidance}} of that knowing old city bird, Mr. Albert Sessions.|$|R
6000|$|... "Thank you," [...] he answered. [...] "To {{tell you}} the truth, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> very marvellous to me. Only {{a few months ago}} your uncle was almost my only client of importance." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, no, John, {{let us go}} on. It's wonderful! It's like a dreamland place. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> {{so close}} and so near to me. How long were the Romans here, Mr. Cunningham?" ...|$|E
6000|$|A bright flush came in {{her cheek}} as she answered, [...] "I didn't know I was looking. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> so strange to me. I {{am trying to}} make out who and what you are." ...|$|E
60|$|Mother smiled wistfully but incredulously. To her <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> as remote, as {{improbable}} as {{a trip to}} Egypt, but I {{continued to}} talk of it as settled and so did William and Maria.|$|R
6000|$|She paused, {{her voice}} breaking. Stephen {{was in a}} glow of holy feeling. Gladness, joy, gratitude, enthusiasm; she knew not which. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> like a noble dream which was coming true. Mrs. Stonehouse went on:- ...|$|R
5000|$|Britten Austin explains: [...] "Everything {{occurs with}} {{apparent}} haphazardness. Yet each stanza {{is a little}} picture, framed by its melody. We remember <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> <b>seem</b> to have lived through it, like a morning in our own lives." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> very simple," [...] Helen admitted. [...] "I think Mr. Lessingham is a {{perfectly}} delightful person, and I shouldn't wonder if you didn't now and then almost imagine that you were happy." ...|$|E
60|$|<b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> strange, incredible, impossible. But La Trappe {{knew the}} race. He knew the {{powerful}} attraction of unattractiveness; {{he knew that}} no life could be imagined, howsoever comfortless and forbidding, but somebody would want to try it.|$|E
6000|$|... “I {{was having}} {{a bit of a}} laugh at the thought of the change that has come over my position. Not that I am {{conceited}} about it, but <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> so strange that I should be here and second in command.” ...|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] replied Orcutt, {{and marched}} off. Janet felt rather sorry for him, {{though she had}} to admit that his manner was exasperating. But Ditmar's anger, instead of cooling, increased: <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> {{directed}} against the unfortunate superintendent.|$|R
60|$|Sometimes, in the darkness, a cow coughed. There was, in the darkness, a slow {{sound of}} cud chewing. And <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> to flow round them and upon {{them as the}} hot blood flows through the womb, laving the unborn young.|$|R
60|$|Out in the {{sunlight}} on Chestnut Street, with the girl by his side, <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> a nightmare. The son of Appleton Brice of Boston {{the owner of a}} beautiful quadroon girl! And he had bought hex with his last cent.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, I don't bear any malice now," [...] she said. [...] "I did at first, naturally. But <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> very ridiculous now I {{have had}} time to think it over. I believe, Mr. Crocker, that I never really cared for him." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{know what}} to think yet, Messer Francisco. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> so big and solid one does not feel as if one was on the water. It's more like living in a house. It does not seem as if {{anything}} could move her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't {{want to talk}} of it," [...] said Cecil. [...] "If I felt worthy {{to grieve}} it would be less dreadful; but <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seems</b> like hypocrisy. Rosamond, {{if you were to}} lose Julius to-morrow, you would not be as unhappy as I am." ...|$|E
60|$|They {{were talking}} war--all talking war. The dandy young models had left England {{because of the}} war, expecting Italy to come in. And {{everybody}} talked, talked, talked. Alvina looked round her. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> alien to her, bruising upon the spirit.|$|R
60|$|They all laughed, and rose. It {{was getting}} dark. They carried the {{things to the}} car. Gudrun locked {{the door of the}} empty house. Birkin had lighted the lamps of the automobile. <b>It</b> <b>all</b> <b>seemed</b> very happy, as if they were setting out.|$|R
5000|$|David Jeffries of AllMusic says Aesop Rock and Rob Sonic [...] "have {{a perfect}} chemistry: Rock makes <b>it</b> <b>all</b> <b>seem</b> vital while Sonic makes <b>it</b> <b>all</b> sound easy". He {{goes on to}} note that [...] "Rock and Sonic handle all the production, block-rocking and electro-boogieing with the old-school in mind." ...|$|R
