This article {{explored}} {{the effect of}} natural light and ultraviolet lamp radiation on the discoloration of the <b>green</b> <b>part</b> of the 4 -year bamboo by using the color analyzer and Fourier transform infrared spectrometer. The results showed that both light treatment could make the discoloration of the bamboos <b>green</b> <b>part</b> obviously, and the lightness increased, the color hue (a*) changed a little, however, the color hue (b*) had a great change, and the aberration(△E*) increased with the increasing duration. FTIR {{results showed that the}} chemical structure of the bamboos <b>green</b> <b>part</b> had a change, and the components of the lignin decreased because of the degradation, but the hydroxyl increased...|$|R

The influences of temperature, time and solvents type has been tested with binder formulation of 60 : 40 between Polypropylene (PP) and FOG derivatives besides the 60 % powder loading of stainless steel powder. Experimental results of the quickest and higher percentage of FOG derivatives leach out from <b>green</b> <b>part</b> is being analysed. The <b>green</b> <b>part</b> will undergo two different solvent debinding (Heptane and Hexane) with three different solvent temperature. Debinding times was set for 10 hours and every 1, 3, 6 and 10 hours the <b>green</b> <b>part</b> will undergo weight measurement for monitoring the weight loss percentage of <b>green</b> <b>part.</b> It seems that both solvent indicates good diffusion and dilution for extracting the FOG derivatives out from the <b>green</b> <b>part</b> in producing brown part where no sign of part crack or swelling during and after solvent debinding. Energy Dispersive Spectrometer (EDS) for element detection and Scanning Electron Microscope (SEM) analysis also being perform which indicates the good pores build up. Results found that the best solvent for removing FOG derivatives is hexane with 60 oC being the choice of solvent temperature...|$|R
25|$|When {{judging the}} {{relative}} luminance (brightness) {{of different colors}} in well-lit situations, humans tend to perceive light within the <b>green</b> <b>parts</b> of the spectrum as brighter than red or blue light of equal power. The luminosity function that describes the perceived brightnesses of different wavelengths is thus roughly analogous to the spectral sensitivity of M cones.|$|E
25|$|Not all {{cells in}} a {{multicellular}} plant contain chloroplasts. All <b>green</b> <b>parts</b> {{of a plant}} contain chloroplasts—the chloroplasts, or more specifically, the chlorophyll in them are what make the photosynthetic parts of a plant green. The plant cells which contain chloroplasts are usually parenchyma cells, though chloroplasts {{can also be found}} in collenchyma tissue. A plant cell which contains chloroplasts is known as a chlorenchyma cell. A typical chlorenchyma cell of a land plant contains about 10 to 100 chloroplasts.|$|E
500|$|The {{maintenance}} dose of warfarin can fluctuate significantly {{depending on the}} amount of vitamin K1 in the diet. Keeping vitamin K1 intake at a stable level can prevent these fluctuations. Leafy green vegetables tend to contain higher amounts of vitamin K1. <b>Green</b> <b>parts</b> of members of the family Apiaceae, such as parsley, cilantro, and dill, are extremely rich sources of vitamin K; cruciferous vegetables such as cabbage and broccoli, as well as the darker varieties of lettuces and other leafy greens, are also relatively high in vitamin K1. Green vegetables such a peas and green beans do not have such high amounts of vitamin K1 as leafy greens. Certain vegetable oils have high amounts of vitamin K1. [...] Foods low in vitamin K1 include roots, bulbs, tubers, and most fruits and fruit juices. Cereals, grains and other milled products are also low in vitamin K1.|$|E

In 28pregnant females from Nicaragua, litter size varied from one to eight, averaging 4.4. The young become reproductively active when seven weeks old and the life cycle is short.|$|E
500|$|In plant {{physiology}} research interest {{was focused on}} the movement of sap and the absorption of substances through the roots. Jan Helmont (1577–1644) by experimental observation and calculation, noted that the increase in weight of a growing plant cannot be derived purely from the soil, and concluded it must relate to water uptake. Englishman Stephen Hales (1677–1761) established by quantitative experiment that there is uptake of water by plants and a loss of water by transpiration and that this is influenced by environmental conditions: he distinguished [...] "root pressure", [...] "leaf suction" [...] and [...] "imbibition" [...] and also noted that the major direction of sap flow in woody tissue is upward. His results were published in Vegetable Staticks (1727) He also noted that [...] "air makes a very considerable part of the substance of vegetables". English chemist Joseph Priestley (1733–1804) is noted for his discovery of oxygen (as now called) and its production by plants. Later Jan Ingenhousz (1730–1799) observed that only in sunlight do the <b>green</b> <b>parts</b> of plants absorb air and release oxygen, this being more rapid in bright sunlight while, at night, the air (CO2) is released from all parts. His results were published in Experiments upon vegetables (1779) and with this the foundations for 20th century studies of carbon fixation were laid. From his observations he sketched the cycle of carbon in nature even though the composition of carbon dioxide was yet to be resolved. Studies in plant nutrition had also progressed. In 1804 Nicolas-Théodore de Saussure's (1767–1845) [...] was an exemplary study of scientific exactitude that demonstrated the similarity of respiration in both plants and animals, that the fixation of carbon dioxide includes water, and that just minute amounts of salts and nutrients (which he analysed in chemical detail from plant ash) have a powerful influence on plant growth.|$|E

60|$|The bean {{has been}} able to perform this great {{chemical}} feat by the help of its green colouring matter, or chlorophyll; for it is only the <b>green</b> <b>parts</b> of the plant which, under the influence of sunlight, have the marvellous power of decomposing carbonic acid, setting free the oxygen and laying hold of the carbon which it contains. In fact, the bean obtains two of the absolutely indispensable elements of its substance from two distinct sources; the watery solution, in which its roots are plunged, contains nitrogen but no carbon; the air, to which the leaves are exposed, contains carbon, but its nitrogen is in the state of a free gas, in which condition the bean can make no use of it;[3] and the chlorophyll[4] is the apparatus by which the carbon is extracted from the atmospheric carbonic acid--the leaves being the chief laboratories in which this operation is effected.|$|E
