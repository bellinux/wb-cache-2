5|$|Four minor {{stages of}} OCD have been {{identified}} after trauma. These include revascularization and formation of <b>granulation</b> (scar) tissue, absorption of necrotic fragments, intertrabecular osteoid deposition, and remodeling of new bone. With delay in the revascularization stage, an OCD lesion develops. A lesion can lead to articular-surface irregularities, which in turn may cause progressive arthritic deterioration.|$|E
5|$|If <b>granulation</b> tissue grows {{over the}} injured site, {{it can cause}} {{stenosis}} of the airway, after a week to a month. The <b>granulation</b> tissue must be surgically excised. Delayed diagnosis of a bronchial rupture increases risk of infection and lengthens hospital stay. People with a narrowed airway may suffer dyspnea, coughing, wheezing, respiratory tract infection, and difficulty with clearing secretions. If the bronchiole is completely obstructed, atelectasis occurs: the alveoli of the lung collapse. Lung tissue distal to a completely obstructed bronchiole often does not become infected. Because {{it is filled with}} mucus, this tissue remains functional. When the secretions are removed, the affected portion of the lung is commonly able to function almost normally. However, infection is common in lungs distal to a partially obstructed bronchiole. Infected lung tissue distal to a stricture can be damaged, and wheezing and coughing may develop due to the narrowing. In addition to pneumonia, the stenosis may cause bronchiectasis, in which bronchi are dilated, to develop. Even after an airway with a stricture is restored to normal, the resulting loss of lung function may be permanent.|$|E
5|$|The third theory {{suggests}} that restricted venous drainage from the brain may be impaired resulting in congestion. Many patients with IIH have narrowing of the transverse sinuses. It {{is not clear whether}} this narrowing is the pathogenesis of the disease or a secondary phenomenon. It has been proposed that a positive biofeedback loop may exist, where raised ICP (intracranial pressure) causes venous narrowing in the transverse sinuses, resulting in venous hypertension (raised venous pressure), decreased CSF resorption via arachnoid <b>granulation</b> and further rise in ICP.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY: Arachnoid <b>granulations</b> {{are rarely}} seen on {{high-resolution}} CT (HRCT) at the posterior temporal bone wall, where they appear as erosions, without bone spicules and {{often with a}} lobulated surface. Differential diagnosis includes endolymphatic sac tumor, paraganglioma, chordoma, and chondromatous and metastatic tumors. MR imaging can confirm the diagnosis because arachnoid <b>granulations</b> behave like CSF without gadolinium enhancement. This report aims to illustrate the appearance and differentiation of temporal bone arachnoid <b>granulations</b> on HRCT and MR imaging. Arachnoid <b>granulations</b> are primarily located in the para-sagittal region along the superior sagittal sinus. Occasion-ally, they are seen at the posterior temporal bone wall. We report the high-resolution CT (HRCT) and MR imaging ap-pearance of such arachnoid <b>granulations</b> and provide a differ-ential diagnosis...|$|R

5|$|There {{are three}} {{different}} types of eruptions. The most well-observed are magmatic eruptions, which involve the decompression of gas within magma that propels it forward. Phreatomagmatic eruptions are another type of volcanic eruption, driven by the compression of gas within magma, the direct opposite of the process powering magmatic activity. The third eruptive type is the phreatic eruption, which {{is driven by the}} superheating of steam via contact with magma; these eruptive types often exhibit no magmatic release, instead causing the <b>granulation</b> of existing rock.|$|E
5|$|The {{chromosphere}} of Tau Ceti—the {{portion of}} a star's atmosphere just above the light-emitting photosphere—currently displays little or no magnetic activity, indicating a stable star. One nine-year study of temperature, <b>granulation,</b> and the chromosphere showed no systematic variations; Ca II emissions around the H and K infrared bands show a possible 11-year cycle, but this is weak relative to the Sun. Alternatively {{it has been suggested}} that the star could be in a low-activity state analogous to a Maunder minimum—a historical period, associated with the Little Ice Age in Europe, when sunspots became exceedingly rare on the Sun's surface. Spectral line profiles of Tau Ceti are extremely narrow, indicating low turbulence and observed rotation. The amplitude of the star's oscillations are about half those of the Sun, and have a lower mode lifetime.|$|E

40|$|The study {{described}} in this paper was concerned with the susceptibility to lubrication with magnesium stearate of tablets compressed from <b>granulations</b> based on native starches or on modified celluloses. Different properties of the <b>granulations,</b> like particle size, flowability and surface area, were analyzed {{in relation to the}} tablet lubricant sensitivity ratio, being the ratio between the decrease in crushing of tablets due to mixing with a lubricant and the crushing strength of tablets prepared without a lubricant. Different linear relationships between the lubricant sensitivity ratio of tablets and the bulk density of the powders were found, for <b>granulations</b> prepared from different starting materials. Flowability proved to be the predominant mechanism in the formation of a lubricant film on the <b>granulations.</b> Poor flow properties, which are characterized by low bulk densities, retard or impede the formation of a lubricant film during mixing...|$|R

Satellite infection may occur with other nodules developing and infection may occur into bone. Although seldom fatal, the disease results in considerable morbidity and deformity.|$|E
50|$|Communicating hydrocephalus, {{also known}} as non-obstructive hydrocephalus, is caused by {{impaired}} cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption {{in the absence of}} any CSF-flow obstruction between the ventricles and subarachnoid space. It has been theorized that this is due to functional impairment of the arachnoidal <b>granulations</b> (also called arachnoid <b>granulations</b> or Pacchioni's <b>granulations),</b> which are located along the superior sagittal sinus and is the site of cerebrospinal fluid reabsorption back into the venous system. Various neurologic conditions may result in communicating hydrocephalus, including subarachnoid/intraventricular hemorrhage, meningitis and congenital absence of arachnoid villi. Scarring and fibrosis of the subarachnoid space following infectious, inflammatory, or hemorrhagic events can also prevent resorption of CSF, causing diffuse ventricular dilatation.|$|R

25|$|This {{reaction}} {{is at its}} worst when the urea solution is heated at low pressure, which happens when the solution is concentrated for prilling or <b>granulation</b> (see below). The reaction products mostly volatilize into the overhead vapours, and recombine when these condense to form urea again, which contaminates the process condensate.|$|E
25|$|The wave heating theory, {{proposed}} in 1949 by Evry Schatzman, proposes that waves carry {{energy from the}} solar interior to the solar chromosphere and corona. The Sun is made of plasma rather than ordinary gas, so it supports several types of waves analogous to sound waves in air. The most important types of wave are magneto-acoustic waves and Alfvén waves. Magneto-acoustic waves are sound waves that have been modified {{by the presence of}} a magnetic field, and Alfvén waves are similar to ultra low frequency radio waves that have been modified by interaction with matter in the plasma. Both types of waves can be launched by the turbulence of <b>granulation</b> and super <b>granulation</b> at the solar photosphere, and both types of waves can carry energy for some distance through the solar atmosphere before turning into shock waves that dissipate their energy as heat.|$|E

30|$|Arachnoid <b>granulations,</b> {{also known}} as pacchionian <b>granulations</b> are {{projections}} of enlarged arachnoid villi into the calvaria or dural venous sinuses. They {{are involved in the}} filtration of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) from the subarachnoid space to the venous system. Histologically, they are composed of dense collagenous connective tissue admixed with clusters of arachnoid cells and a network of delicate vascular space filled with CSF from the contiguous subarachnoid space [5, 58].|$|R
40|$|In {{this study}} the {{meninges}} of 66 {{species of birds}} were microscopically examined to determine occurrence and morphology of PACCHIONIAN <b>granulations</b> in birds. Furthermore, the morphology of the meningeal sheaths of the olfactory bulb and sheaths of the olfactory nerves up to their entrance into the olfactory epithelium were examined by electron microscope in two species of mammals (rat and cat) and birds (chicken and pigeon), respectively, to determine their suitability as possible pathways for cerebrospinal fluid absorption in birds. Reviewed literature and {{the findings of this}} study were discussed with focus on biophysical evaluation and accordance of morphology and function of PACCHIONIAN <b>granulations</b> in birds, mammals, and man. Material was obtained from post mortem dissections, slaughtered and euthanised animals; for electron microscopy, material included specimens from previous studies by the anatomy department. Classes of birds were divided in large species (brain size as in chicken or larger) and small species (brain size smaller than in chicken). <b>Granulations</b> were found in all large birds with the exception of a penguin chick. They may further occur in a few small bird species. In most small bird species, no <b>granulations</b> were found; Textor cucullatus showed one specimen with and without <b>granulations,</b> respectively. In birds, <b>granulations</b> are found in the dorsal sinus system of the dura mater. They are always located at the conflux of the olfactory sinuses into the dorsal sagittal sinus und may in some cases in large birds additionally occur at other sites like confluxes of large sinuses or entrances of greater cerebral veins into the dorsal sinus system. Four further sites of occurrence of <b>granulations</b> were found: caudal of the entrance of cerebral veins into the dorsal sagittal sinus (unpaired), bilateral at the entrance of the transversal sinuses into the occipital resp. dorsal sagittal sinus, in the sagittal olfactory sinus before its splitting into the olfactory sinuses (unpaired), and in the dorsal sagittal sinus directly rostral of the pineal gland. Most <b>granulations</b> in birds are between 300 and 600 ým in diameter, some individuals showed smaller (200 ým) or larger (more than 1000 ým) <b>granulations.</b> They are leptomeningeal structures which always are totally coated by sinus endothelium, and consist of three structural elements: the central Stratum reticulare, which is correspondent to the mashlike connective tissue of the reticular arachnoid, the Stratum fibrosum without correspondence to the usual leptomeningeal sheaths, and the Stratum cellulare, which is correspondent to the neurothelium and arachnoid barrier layer. Electron microscopy showed that from a morphological point of view passage of cerebrospinal fluid into the mucous membrane of the nose is possible underneath the perineural epithelium of olfactory nerve, i. e. through the endoneurium, in both mammals and birds. The fluid may then be absorbed by lymph vessels of the olfactory mucosa. For morphological reasons and because of their specific localisation, <b>granulations</b> are not suited for cerebrospinal fluid absorption in birds; rather, a haemodynamic function, as it is suggested by various authors in the literature, seems probable. From a morphological point of view, cerebrospinal fluid in birds has access to other pathways of absorption, for example via olfactory nerve sheaths. The findings in the reviewed literature concerning morphology and function of PACCHIONIAN <b>granulations</b> in man and mammals are often contradictive to each other. The reasons for this may lie in the difficulty of access to and high susceptibility of the meningeal tissue as well as in the application of out-dated morphological techniques and imprecise biophysical evaluation of experimental studies. Future studies should be performed using modern, tissue preserving techniques and scientifically impregnable methods...|$|R

25|$|High-quality {{compound}} fertilizers containing nitrogen co-granulated {{with other}} components such as phosphates {{have been produced}} routinely since {{the beginnings of the}} modern fertilizer industry, but on account of the low melting point and hygroscopic nature of urea it took courage to apply the same kind of technology to granulate urea on its own. But {{at the end of the}} 1970s three companies began to develop fluidized-bed <b>granulation.</b> The first in the field was Nederlandse Stikstof Maatschappij, which later became part of Hydro Agri (now Yara International). Yara eventually sold this technology to Uhde GmbH, whose Uhde Fertilizer Technology (UFT) subsidiary now markets it. Around the same time Toyo Engineering Corporation developed its spouted-bed process, comprising a fluidized bed deliberately agitated to produce turbulent ebullation. Stamicarbon also undertook development work on its own fluidized-bed <b>granulation</b> system, using film sprays rather than atomizing sprays to introduce the urea melt, but shelved it until the 1990s, when there was for a time considerable doubt about the commercial future of the Hydro (UFT) process. As a result, the Stamicarbon technology is now commercialized and highly successful. More recently, Urea Casale introduced a different fluidized-bed <b>granulation</b> system: the urea is sprayed in laterally from the side walls of the granulator instead of from the bottom. This organizes the bed into two cylindrical masses contrarotating on parallel longitudinal axes. The raw product is uniform enough to not require screens.|$|E

25|$|In {{skin wound}} healing, CYR61 is highly {{expressed}} in the <b>granulation</b> tissue by myofibroblasts, which proliferate and rapidly synthesize ECM to maintain tissue integrity and to promote regeneration of parenchymal cells. However, excessive matrix deposition can lead to fibrosis, scarring, and loss of tissue function. In skin wounds, CYR61 accumulates in the <b>granulation</b> tissue as myofibroblasts proliferate, and eventually reaches a sufficiently high level to drive the myofibroblasts themselves into senescence, whereupon these cells cease to proliferate and express matrix-degrading enzymes. Thus, CYR61 limits synthesis and deposition of ECM by myofibroblasts, {{reducing the risk of}} fibrosis during wound healing. In addition to skin wound healing, CYR61 expression is elevated in remodeling cardiomyocytes after myocardial infarction, in vascular injury, and in the long bones during fracture repair. Blockade of CYR61 by antibodies inhibits bone fracture healing in mice. In the kidney, CYR61 is expressed in podocytes in normal adult and embryonic glomeruli, but expression is decreased in IgA nephropathy, diabetic nephropathy, and membranous nephropathy, particularly in diseased kidneys with severe mesangial expansion.|$|E
