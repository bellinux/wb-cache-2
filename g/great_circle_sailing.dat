Intersection between two <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> or between a <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> and a parallel is also analyzed.

50|$|A <b>great</b> <b>circle,</b> {{also known}} as an orthodrome, of a sphere is the {{intersection}} of the sphere and a plane that passes through the center point of the sphere. A <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> is the largest circle that can be drawn on any given sphere. Any diameter of any <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> coincides with a diameter of the sphere, and therefore all <b>great</b> <b>circles</b> have the same center and circumference as each other. This special case of a circle of a sphere is in opposition to a small circle, that is, {{the intersection of the}} sphere and a plane that does not pass through the center.

5000|$|Converting ruler {{distance}} on the Mercator map into true (<b>great</b> <b>circle)</b> {{distance on}} the sphere is straightforward along the equator but nowhere else. One {{problem is the}} variation of scale with latitude, and another is that straight lines on the map (rhumb lines), other than the meridians or the equator, do not correspond to <b>great</b> <b>circles.</b> The distinction between rhumb (<b>sailing)</b> distance and <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> (true) distance was clearly understood by Mercator. (See Legend 12 on the 1569 map.) He stressed that the rhumb line distance is an acceptable approximation for true <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> distance for courses of short or moderate distance, particularly at lower latitudes. He even quantifies his statement: [...] "When the <b>great</b> <b>circle</b> distances which are to be measured {{in the vicinity of}} the equator do not exceed 20 degrees of a <b>great</b> <b>circle,</b> or 15 degrees near Spain and France, or 8 and even 10 degrees in northern parts it is convenient to use rhumb line distances".|$|R
