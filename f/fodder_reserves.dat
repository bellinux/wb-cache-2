40|$|An {{inventory}} {{model is}} used to determine least-cost <b>fodder</b> <b>reserves</b> for sheep in the Hamilton area of Victoria.

Compared with studies based on probabilities of effective rainfall, the approach used measures more accurately {{the way in which}} drought incidence is affected by the seasonal pattern of pasture production in relation to animal requirements. The grazing model facilitates a study of the relative severity of drought at a range of stocking rates and a number of probability distributions are identified. The refinements achieved by using a grazing model also allow a more realistic treatment of penalty costs than the usual prescription of a constant drought price for fodder. Furthermore it allows for the determination of least-cost <b>fodder</b> <b>reserves</b> for a range of stocking rates, and thus a comparison between stocking rates is possible because allowances can be made for the effect of different timing and level of feeding on feed costs.

30|$|In Chepareria, {{enclosures}} {{were established}} to provide dry-season grazing reserves (Makokha et al. 1999; Kitalyi et al. 2002). Initially, enclosures were only used as dry-season <b>fodder</b> <b>reserves</b> while livestock were grazed {{in the open}} range during the rainy season. However, the continuous establishment of enclosures in Chepareria has reduced the available communal land, hence restricting livestock grazing within individual enclosures only. With reduced communal and individual land holdings, the need to diversify and complement sources of household livelihood, particularly from land use among enclosure owners, is gaining momentum. While the dominance of livestock-based management regimes in our study reaffirms previous studies which report that enclosures in African rangelands were mainly established for livestock grazing (Gaani et al. 2002; Nedessa et al. 2005; Napier and Desta 2011), we have also observed agricultural diversification of land use among enclosure owners to include crop cultivation, contractual grazing and fodder/grass seed production.|$|E

Furthermore, developments in rangeland ecology raise questions about claims for grazing-induced degradation and call for a reinterpretation of recent shifts in vegetation on the Syrian steppe.

40|$|The overall {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine the most utilized browse species in the sub-humid zone in Burkina Faso, and to evaluate their potential as fodder for ruminants. The behaviour of sheep, goats and cattle was recorded on natural pasture using a direct observation method and farmers were interviewed concerning use of browse species. The phenological and chemical variations over the year were estimated through observations and collection of foliage samples every second week. The foliage biomass was evaluated using complete cutting and weighing. The nutritive value and the effect of feeding these foliages on growth performance were assessed in sheep using a completely randomised design. The browsing activity was about 25 % of the total grazing time for all the animal species during the dry season. During the cool season the time spent browsing by goats (17 %) was significantly higher than for sheep (7 %) and cattle (5 %). The plant species with the highest frequency of consumption by animals and most cited as fodder trees by farmers were Acacia dudgeoni Craib. ex Holl., Ficus gnaphalocarpa (Miq.) A. Rich, Dichrostachys cinerea (L.) Wight & Arn., Faidherbia albida A. Chevalier, Afzelia africana Sm. ex Pers., Khaya senegalensis (Desv.) A. Juss. and Pterocarpus erinaceus Poir. The foliage biomass per ha of the last three species differed significantly (0. 3, 0. 6 and 1. 3 t dry matter (dm), respectively). The dm intake and apparent digestibility of dm for A. africana were the highest, 571 g/day and 582 g/kg, respectively. Significant relationships were found between the foliage biomass and the circumference of the crown for A. africana (R 2 = 82 %) and P. erinaceus (R 2 = 81 %). The growth rate was around 60 g/day when feeding a diet including A. africana and P. erinaceus, higher than with the diet with K. senegalensis (48 g/day).

Forty-five male (non-castrated) Santa Inês sheep, averaging 27. 50 ± 0. 48 kg body weight (BW) at the beginning of the study, were used in this trial. A completely randomized block design with nine replicates per treatment was used. The intakes of DM, OM, CP, EE, TC, NFC, TDN and ME were quadratic, while the intakes of mineral matter (MM) and NDF increased linearly with increased levels of cactus pear in the diet. The voluntary intake of water decreased with increased levels of cactus pear in the diet. Increased levels of cactus pear in the diet increased the apparent digestibility of DM, OM, CP, NDF, and TC linearly, but did not influence the digestibility of EE or NFC. Daily weight gain (DWG) and feed efficiency decreased linearly with increased levels of cactus pear in the diet. The replacement of corn by cactus pear does not affect the conversion of the feed.

40|$|Natural {{conditions}} in Skierniewice province are rather unfavorable for highly effective agricultural production. The 11 - agitating factors include low precipitation amounts (table 2), {{and especially in}} the period of intensive plant growth along with a big share of soils belonging to low bonitation classes 'over 60 per cent), which are poor in nutritious components by their nature and suffer periodically or permanently from lack of humidity. It is most noticeable in central and central-south em regions of the administrative province where crops are below the national average. Simultaneously the province is poor in surface waters with agricultural storage reservoirs being absent. An important factor impeding modernization and intensification of plant production, and especially in animal breeding, is insufficient supply of rural farms with water. In the spatial structure of the province the index of quality agricultural production space is largely differentiated fig. 2.

40|$|Agricultural {{settlement}} {{projects have}} been the main Jordanian strategy to settle the nomads. This study focuses on one example of this strategy, namely the Qatrana projects. The main objectives {{of this study are}} to analyze the traditional socio-economic aspects of the Qatrana people, spontaneous settlement and changes which have experienced by them, the Jordanian policy to settle the nomads, and the achievements of the Qatrana settlement projects to the planned governmental goals and the settlers' objectives. Major findings of the study are that: (1) traditional nomads in Qatrana were adaptive to their arid environment in terms of their socio-economic way of life. (2) in Qatrana, the traditional nomadic way of life is diminishing, and the number of nomads is declining because they are vulnerable to the recent forces of change. (3) Jordan's official strategy to settle the nomads has been to encourage them to settle on the basis of agricultural projects and social services provided at these projects. This strategy has been carried out within the general policy of national development. To determine the achievements of settlement projects in Jordan, interview schedules in Qatrana were conducted by the writer with 66 settlers, representing all the families in the projects and 50 households of the squatters. Results of the survey showed that the governmental goals in terms of creating a <b>reserve</b> <b>fodder</b> for the animals in the area and for sheep fattening, and alleviating pressure put on the natural range have failed. The governmental goals to settle the nomads and improve their living conditions, which coincides with the settlers' goals to settle, have succeeded in social equity terms, but not in economic efficiency terms. The majority of Qatrana nomads were settled in fixed houses, received title to the lands, enjoyed better living conditions, social services and greater income. These achievements have been of high governmental costs. It seems that settling the Jordanian nomads on the basis of livestock and range management strategy would develop the nomadic sector in Jordan with less costs than the agricultural strategy...|$|R

As {{a measure of}} environmental mitigation, the realization of a livestock system of a herd of sucker cows pasturing in the wind farm areas is proposed. This has implications for environmental maintenance, employment in a territory gradually losing its population, and for tourism. The study, having focused on those aspects that reduce landscape impact and carrying out {{an analysis of the}} individual areas to evaluate forage resources and the different pastoral indexes, identifies the maximum sustainable load of animals (335 UBA/ha) in the current conditions of neglect. So, some measures to improve and increase sustainable herds have been proposed and examined.

40|$|Following a {{discussion}} of drought strategies available to the grazier, one particular strategy, the holding of drought <b>fodder</b> <b>reserves,</b> is examined in detail. The study estimates the least-cost <b>fodder</b> <b>reserves</b> {{for a range of}} stocking rate-pasture production regimes in the Hamilton region. The amount of hay feeding required on any stocking-pasture regime is determined from a simulation model of the grazing complex. In this model, three levels of pasture production are stocked at rates ranging from one to ten wethers per acre. The pasture production assumed ranges from "excellent" (i. e. equivalent to the Hamilton Research Station pastures which produce about 10, 000 lb. dry matter per annum) to "poor" (35 % less). The climatic inputs into the grazing model are the date of Autumn break, for which a formula is derived, and the June to October rainfall. The pasture sub-model is specified and used to derive the pasture which is "grown" in the grazing model. The sheep aspects of the model are reviewed in detail to derive the relationships which are used in the next set of four sub-models in which animal intake is simulated and liveweight changes determined. This set of four sub-models provides for the four situations of animal intake which may be met. These are: The intake of green pasture alone (i. e. all pasture grown after the Autumn Break); the intake of hay alone; the intake of hay and green pasture together; the intake of hay and dry pasture (pasture remaining when the Autumn Break occurs and dry pasture alone which are handled in the same sub-model) The grazing model was validated for the years 1965 - 67 using data from the Pastoral Research Station, Hamilton, and showed good agreement for all three years simulated, one of which featured a severe drought. Drought feeding requirements (hay) are determined for each of the years 1879 to 1967 and for the ten stocking rate-pasture production regimes, using specific hay feeding rules. These rules, which aim at sheep survival, do not attempt to specify optimum feeding rates per sheep, and any change in them could significantly alter the drought requirements for any of the regimes studied. Furthermore, the estimates are Lased on the assumption that all sheep are fed through the drought. A pre-drought strategy which permitted the sale of certain classes of sheep at some stage during drought would entail lower feed requirements and might have a lower expected cost, especially at high acquisition costs for feed and low replacement costs for sheep. An inventory analysis is then undertaken, based on a 12 month planning period, which utilises the hay feeding probabilities generated in the grazing model, and provides estimates of the least-cost hay reserve. In contrast to previous studies, the price of hay is related to drought length in calculating the penalty cost of inadequate reserves. The effects of varying several parameters of the inventory model are then examined. The parameters varied are hay costs ($ 4, $ 10 and $ 16 per ton), interest rates (7 %, 20 % and 50 %), and salvage values, and these vary in association with the parameters varied in the grazing model (stocking rate, pasture production and the area closed for hay). At the intermediate values for pasture production and hay cost and a 7 per cent per annum interest rate, the minimum-cost reserve rises sharply, from 2 bales per acre at 2 wethers per acre, to 4. 5 bales per acre at 3 wethers per acre, 8 bales per acre at 4 wethers per acre, and 15 bales per acre at 5 wethers per acre. The minimum-cost reserve was found to be relatively insensitive to changes in acquisition costs, except at low stocking rates, where a change in reserve of one or two half-bales per sheep was common as acquisition cost varied over the three levels. The effect of interest rates was also examined for the average pasture regime. On the lowest level of hay acquisition cost, ($ 4 per ton) increasing the rate of interest from 7 to 50 per cent caused reductions of only one half-bale per sheep. However, at high acqusition cost ($ 16 per ton) raising the interest rate to 20 per cent resulted in a considerable reduction in the minimum-cost reserve, especially on the lower stocking rates, and raising the interest rate to 50 per cent made holding <b>fodder</b> <b>reserves</b> uneconomic for any stocking rate. One measure of the risk in holding various levels of fodder reserve is the standard deviation of the total expected cost. As expected, it was found that this declines as the reserve is expanded to the maximum ever required. However, only a small reduction in standard deviation results from expanding the reserve beyond the minimum-cost level. Finally, estimates were made of the income-maximising stocking rate for each level of pasture production and hay cost, with the wool price at 30, 40 and 50 cents per lb [...] At the intermediate values for pasture production (8, 000 lb. D. M.) and hay cost ($ 10 per ton), and with wool at 30 cents per lb. net, the income-maximising stocking rate was 3 wethers per acre. Each increase of 10 cents per lb. in the wool price was generally associated with an increase of one or two wethers per acre in the income-maximising stocking rate. An increase of 2, 000 lb. D. M. (from "average" to "excellent") in average annual pasture production was generally associated with an increase of one wether per acre in the income-maximising stocking rate. A reduction of 1, 500 lb. from "average" to "poor" pasture. production reduced the income-maximising stocking rate by about one wether per acre. Increasing the hay cost from $ 4 to $ 10 per ton reduced the profit-maximising stocking rate by one wether per acre for all combinations of pasture production and wool price examined. However, a further increase in acquisition cost from $ 10 to $ 16 per ton only caused a further reduction in the income-maximising stocking rate at the poor level of pasture production: with average pasture production there was little change and with excellent production there was no change in the income-maximising stocking rate.
