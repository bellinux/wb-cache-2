25|$|<b>Dextrins</b> can be {{produced}} from starch using enzymes like amylases, as during digestion {{in the human body}} and during malting and mashing, or by applying dry heat under acidic conditions (pyrolysis or roasting). The latter process is used industrially, and also occurs on the surface of bread during the baking process, contributing to flavor, color and crispness. <b>Dextrins</b> produced by heat are also known as pyrodextrins.

This study investigates hydrolysis method of breadfruit starch into <b>dextrin</b> with Sulphate Acid (H 2 SO 4) catalysator. <b>Dextrin</b> hydrolysis is carry out {{in order to produce}} high <b>dextrin</b> percentage by subtracting the total glucose with free glucose. This study evaluates composition change because of breadfruit starch in various time and temperature. Optimum <b>dextrin</b> percentage is obtained at hydrolysis temperature of 100 ºC, hydrolysis time 10 minutes, and 0. 5 N H 2 SO 4 concentration, with <b>dextrin</b> percentage of 77. 12 %. Furthermore, <b>dextrin</b> obtained is added by casein, cold water, triethanolamine, and water in order to form adhesive. The reserch result showed that the shear strength of the <b>dextrin</b> glue is 14 kg/cm 2 which is larger than that of glue of Fox brands sold in the market that is only 12. 48 kg/cm 2. Because there is previous study regarding starch hydrolysis from breadfruit by using chloride acid catalysator, then data in this research show the influence of the sulphate acid usage as catalysator of adhesive.

25|$|Carbohydrates are an {{important}} source of energy for growing infants, as they account for 35 to 42% of their daily energy intake. In most cow's milk-based formulas, lactose is the main source of carbohydrates present, but lactose is not present in cow's milk-based lactose-free formulas nor specialized non-milk protein formulas or hydrolyzed protein formulas for infants with milk protein sensitivity. Lactose is also not present in soy-based formulas. Therefore, those formulas without lactose will use other sources of carbohydrates, such as sucrose and glucose, <b>dextrins,</b> and natural and modified starches. Lactose is not only a good source of energy, it also aids in the absorption of the minerals magnesium, calcium, zinc and iron.|$|E
40|$|The {{interactions}} of <b>dextrin</b> with biotite mica and galena {{have been investigated}} through adsorption, flotation, and electrokinetic measurements. The adsorption densities of <b>dextrin</b> onto mica continuously increase with increase of pH, while those onto galena show a maximum at pH 11. 5. It is observed that the adsorption density of <b>dextrin</b> onto galena is quite high compared to that on mica. Both the adsorption isotherms exhibit Langmuirian behavior. Electrokinetic measurements portray conformational rearrangements of macromolecules with the loading, resulting in a shift of the shear plane, further away from the interface. Dissolution experiments indicate release of the lattice metal ions from mica and galena. Coprecipitation tests confirm polymer-metal ion interaction in the bulk solution. <b>Dextrin</b> does not exhibit any depressant action toward mica, whereas, with galena, the flotation recovery is decreased {{with an increase in}} pH beyond 9, in the presence of <b>dextrin,</b> complementing the adsorption results.

40|$|The {{separation}} of minerals by flotation {{depends on the}} effectiveness of the reagents used. The performance of depressants is paramount in rejecting the undesirable minerals while maintaining acceptable recoveries of the desired mineral. Iron-bearing minerals are the main contaminants in many ores: their removal is critical. Several different types of depressants have been used for this purpose, many of which are toxic. A shift has been made toward more environmentally friendly reagents including starch and <b>dextrin.</b> The purpose of this thesis was to determine the depression mechanism of <b>dextrin</b> on pyrite. A number of techniques were applied to give insight into the mechanism, including adsorption studies, microflotation tests, and solution and surface analyses. It was revealed that <b>dextrin</b> only adsorbed on mineral surfaces that contained some metal ionic sites. The degree of adsorption depended {{on the nature of the}} metal species, with lead being more reactive than iron. <b>Dextrin</b> was able to depress pyrite, regardless of whether <b>dextrin</b> adsorbed or not; however, adsorbed <b>dextrin</b> was more effective. It appeared as if <b>dextrin</b> inhibited the formation of dixanthogen on the surface, which could lead to reduced floatability of pyrite.
