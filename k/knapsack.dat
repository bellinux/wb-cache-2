5|$|Halkett's first {{design was}} a {{collapsible}} and inflatable boat made of rubber-impregnated cloth. When deflated, {{the hull of}} the boat could be worn as a cloak, the oar used as a walking stick, and the sail as an umbrella. This {{was followed by a}} two-man craft that was small enough to fit into a <b>knapsack,</b> and when deflated served as a waterproof blanket.|$|E
5|$|At 5:24pm Cooper was {{informed}} that his demands had been met, and at 5:39pm the aircraft landed at Seattle-Tacoma Airport. Cooper instructed Scott to taxi the jet to an isolated, brightly lit section of the tarmac and close each window shade in the cabin to deter police snipers. Northwest Orient's Seattle operations manager, Al Lee, approached the aircraft in street clothes (to avoid the possibility that Cooper might mistake his airline uniform for that of a police officer) and delivered the cash-filled <b>knapsack</b> and parachutes to Mucklow via the aft stairs. Once the delivery was completed, Cooper permitted all passengers, Schaffner, and senior flight attendant Alice Hancock to leave the plane.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} 3, we study the {{complexity}} of solving hard knap-sack problems, i. e., <b>knapsacks</b> with a density close to 1 where lattice-based low density attacks are not an option. For such <b>knapsacks,</b> the cur-rent state-of-the-art is a 31 -year old algorithm by Schroeppel and Shamir {{which is based on}} birthday paradox techniques and yields a running time of Õ(2 n/ 2) for <b>knapsacks</b> of n elements and uses Õ(2 n/ 4) storage. We propose here two new algorithms which improve on this bound, finally lowering the running time down to Õ(20. 3113 n) for almost all <b>knapsacks</b> of density 1. We also demonstrate the practicality of these algorithms with an implementation. ...|$|R

He {{borrowed}} {{a pair of}} hiking boots and a <b>knapsack</b> and left the city, having finally decided to tell Mary about his wife and son. Heading north, he spent a night in an air-raid shelter in Bologna, then took a train to Verona and walked {{the rest of the}} way; he apparently traveled over 450 miles in all. Mary almost failed to recognize him when he arrived, he was so dirty and tired. He told her everything about his other family; she later admitted she felt more pity than anger.|$|E
25|$|<b>Knapsack</b> {{problems}} {{appear in}} real-world decision-making processes {{in a wide}} variety of fields, such as finding the least wasteful way to cut raw materials, selection of investments and portfolios, selection of assets for asset-backed securitization, and generating keys for the Merkle–Hellman and other <b>knapsack</b> cryptosystems.|$|E
25|$|Here xi {{represents}} {{the number of}} instances of item i {{to include in the}} <b>knapsack.</b> Informally, the problem is to maximize the sum of the values of the items in the <b>knapsack</b> so that the sum of the weights is {{less than or equal to}} the knapsack's capacity.|$|E

25|$|While many {{algorithms}} {{reach an}} exact solution, approximation algorithms seek an approximation that {{is closer to}} the true solution. Approximation can be reached by either using a deterministic or a random strategy. Such algorithms have practical value for many hard problems. One of the examples of an approximate algorithm is the <b>Knapsack</b> problem. The <b>Knapsack</b> problem is a problem where there is a set of given items. The goal of the problem is to pack the <b>knapsack</b> to get the maximum total value. Each item has some weight and some value. Total weight that we can carry is no more than some fixed number X. So, we must consider weights of items as well as their value.|$|E

25|$|As {{with many}} useful but {{computationally}} complex algorithms, {{there has been}} substantial research on creating and analyzing algorithms that approximate a solution. The <b>knapsack</b> problem, though NP-Hard, {{is one of a}} collection of algorithms that can still be approximated to any specified degree. This means that the problem has a polynomial time approximation scheme. To be exact, the <b>knapsack</b> problem has a fully polynomial time approximation scheme (FPTAS).|$|E

50|$|At this point, Colonel Miller's nerve {{seems to}} have gone. His men had {{discarded}} their <b>knapsacks</b> {{at the beginning of}} the battle so that they could fight more effectively. Now, Miller refused to go back into the woods to retrieve the <b>knapsacks</b> in case the enemy were waiting there to ambush him. He camped in a large clearing and the next morning, he refused to continue the advance to the Rapids. Miller may have been shaken by the comparatively heavy casualties that his command had suffered. He clearly did not fancy another encounter with Muir. He was also very ill, and almost in a state of collapse.|$|R
25|$|The <b>knapsack</b> {{problem or}} {{rucksack}} {{problem is a}} problem in combinatorial optimization: Given a set of items, each with a weight and a value, determine the number of each item to include in a collection so that the total weight is {{less than or equal to}} a given limit and the total value is as large as possible. It derives its name from the problem faced by someone who is constrained by a fixed-size <b>knapsack</b> and must fill it with the most valuable items.|$|E

25|$|There {{are many}} {{variations}} of the <b>knapsack</b> problem that have arisen from the vast number of applications of the basic problem. The main variations occur by changing the number of some problem parameter such {{as the number of}} items, number of objectives, or even the number of knapsacks.|$|E
25|$|This {{variation}} {{changes the}} goal of the individual filling the <b>knapsack.</b> Instead of one objective, such as maximizing the monetary profit, the objective could have several dimensions. For example, there could be environmental or social concerns as well as economic goals. Problems frequently addressed include portfolio and transportation logistics optimizations.|$|E
