500|$|When John Singer Sargent's {{portrait}} {{of her was}} presented by her fellow-workers in 1898, Hill made a speech in which she said, [...] "When I am gone, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>my</b> friends will not try to carry out any special system, or to follow blindly in the track which I have trodden. New circumstances require various efforts, {{and it is the}} spirit, not the dead form, that should be perpetuated. ... We shall leave them a few houses, purified and improved, a few new and better ones built, a certain amount of thoughtful and loving management, a few open spaces..." [...] But, she said, more important would be [...] "the quick eye to see, the true soul to measure, the large hope to grasp the mighty issues of the new and better days to come [...] – greater ideals, greater hope, and patience to realize both." ...|$|E
2500|$|For Glazer, it was {{a simple}} reality that could not be denied, but he {{remained}} deeply ambivalent about multiculturalism, arguing that it [...] "is not a phase we can embrace wholeheartedly, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>my</b> own sense of regret that we have come to this will not escape the reader." ...|$|E
2500|$|The Israeli Forum for the Promotion of Equal Share in the Burden {{threatened}} {{to boycott the}} fashion chain Fox if they hired Refaeli. The two sides reached a compromise in which Refaeli agreed to visit injured IDF soldiers whenever she is in Israel, and actively encourage enlistment in the army. Refaeli later said, [...] "I don't regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That's {{just the way it}} is: celebrities have other needs. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>my</b> case has influenced the army." [...] She also said: [...] "Israel or Uganda, what difference does it make? It makes no difference to me. Why is it good to die for our country? What, isn't it better to live in New York? Why should 18-year-old kids have to die? It's dumb that people have to die so that I can live in Israel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{have already}} fully {{considered}} this painful subject," [...] said Lord Evandale; [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>hoped,</b> <b>my</b> dear Edith, your own inquiries, {{as well as}} mine, had fully convinced you that these regrets were fruitless." ...|$|R

2500|$|Savarkar {{submitted}} {{his next}} mercy petition on November 14, 1913, and presented it personally to the Home Member of the Governor General’s council, Sir Reginald Craddock. In his letter, asking for forgiveness, he {{described himself as}} a [...] "prodigal son" [...] longing to return to the [...] "parental doors of the government". He wrote that his release from the jail will recast the faith of many Indians in the British rule. Also he said [...] "Moreover, my conversion to the constitutional line would bring back all those misled young men in India and abroad who were once looking up to me as their guide. I am ready to serve the government in any capacity they like, for as my conversion is conscientious so <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>my</b> future conduct would be. By keeping me in jail, nothing can be got in comparison to what would be otherwise." ...|$|E
2500|$|After [...] "I'm Yours" [...] {{remained}} at the Billboard Hot 100 chart for a record 76 weeks ending in October 2009 (peaking at number 6), Mraz headed to the Gulf of Mexico {{during the summer of}} 2010 to help with efforts to clean the Deepwater Horizon oil spill. Later, he went to a trip to Ghana to fight child slavery alongside the nonprofit organization Free the Slaves. Later, Mraz was in Antarctica, spending time with Al Gore and learning about climate change aboard the National Geographic Explorer. During his activist outings, Mraz wrote and recorded his fourth album, Love Is a Four Letter Word, with producer Joe Chiccarelli. In an interview for Billboard, he confessed that he was less interested in following up his biggest hit than using the power that [...] "I'm Yours" [...] gave him to fuel positive change. He further elaborated: [...] "The pressure I put on myself, or what <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>my</b> 'I Won't Give Up' does, is {{to make a difference in}} people's lives [...] [...] [...] With 'I'm Yours,' I got to go out and set my feet on different continents, and expose myself to different cultures and causes. I wanted to see who I was, outside of music." ...|$|E
2500|$|Commenting on {{this first}} edition of The United Irishman, Lord Stanley in the House of Lords, on 24 February 1848, {{maintained}} that the paper pursued [...] "the purpose of exciting sedition and rebellion among her Majesty's subjects in Ireland... it is language used in no common way, {{and for this reason}} I have called the attention of her Majesty's Government to it. This is not a mere casual article in a newspaper—it is the declaration of the aim and object for which it is established, and of the design with which its promoters have set out; that object being {{to do everything possible to}} drive the people of Ireland to sedition, to urge them into open rebellion, and to promote civil war for the purpose of exterminating every Englishman in Ireland. <b>I</b> <b>hope,</b> <b>my</b> Lords, her Majesty's Government will not say that this is a matter quite in theory—that it is below contempt, and that we should allow it to pass by in silence. If such a publication had appeared in England, I should have been very much inclined to think the good sense and sound judgment of the people would have rejected the article at once as a seditious invective, whose very violence, like an overdose of poison, prevented its effect.|$|E
6000|$|... "While I am in your service, Sir Percival," [...] I said, [...] "I <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> know <b>my</b> duty {{well enough}} not to inquire into your motives. When I am out of your service, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> know <b>my</b> own place well {{enough not to}} speak of matters which don't concern me--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Nothing of the kind," [...] {{returned}} Jimmy. [...] "I wouldn't for {{a minute}} think of going before you. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>I</b> know <b>my</b> manners better than that." ...|$|R
6000|$|I answered, not {{a little}} abashed, [...] "That being bred to no profession, and having no funds of my own, it was {{obviously}} {{impossible for me to}} subsist without some allowance from my father; that my wishes were very moderate; and that <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>my</b> aversion for the profession to which he had designed me, would not occasion his altogether withdrawing his paternal support and protection." ...|$|R
2500|$|In November 2014, Tsai {{released}} her thirteenth studio album, Play. Tsai commented, [...] "The album refers to film script, acting or performance, which helped me gain wisdom and experiences {{during the past}} two years. With the new witty music, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>my</b> fans will find it playful and joyful as well as bringing optimism to the future." [...] The album garnered critical acclaim and was declared it as [...] "easily the best album of the year". Commercially, the album sold more than 85,000 copies in Taiwan, and made her the best-selling female singer of the year in Taiwan. The title track, [...] "Play", reached number one on the Hit FM Top 100 Singles of the Year. The track, [...] "The Third Person and I", reached number eight on the Hit FM Top 100. The music video of [...] "Play" [...] became the most-viewed music video of Taiwan in 2014 and helped thrust her into the international spotlight. Nolan Feeney from Time magazine commented, [...] "It might be the year's best pop music video." [...] She was nominated for an MTV Europe Music Award for Best Taiwanese Act. The album also received ten Golden Melody Award nominations—nine in the 26th Golden Melody Awards and one in the 27th—and eventually won for Best Mandarin Album and Best Vocal Recording Album. In December 2015, she performed the song, [...] "Play", at the 2015 Mnet Asian Music Awards, where she won for Best Asian Artist. In May 2015, she began her Play World Tour, and the show was her first collaboration with Live Nation Entertainment. In October 2015, a worker was killed when the sound, lighting, and video rigging collapsed at a concert that she was planning for at Guangxi Sports Center in Nanning. Tsai expressed sadness on her blog.|$|E
