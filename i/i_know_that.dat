5|$|I {{actually}} wrote a {{song about}} it on my album, it's called 'GUY' and it stands for 'Go Under You'. So wearing make-up, smelling delicious and having suckable, kissable, edible things between your limbs is something I find strengthening because <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> when I pick the right guy, I can let him have it. Some women feel oppressed by make-up and clothing, and here’s to them, they {{have every right to}} feel that way as well.|$|E
5|$|I've {{never had}} chills through my entire body like I had from hearing Beyoncé sing this song. 'I Was Here' came from my soul {{and became the}} song that was coming from hers. In all my life, I have never heard {{anything}} as amazing as this. Hearing her sing 'I Was Here' will forever {{be one of the}} best moments of my life, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> this song will touch many other lives as well.|$|E
5|$|In {{the control}} and living spaces, the ship had quieted down, too. Orders were given in low voices; the men speak to each other, {{carrying}} out their normal duties, in a repressed atmosphere. A regular pall has descended upon us. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> all hands {{are aware of the}} decision and recognize the need for it. Perhaps they are relieved {{that they did not have}} to make it. But it is apparent that this unexpected illness, something that could neither have been foreseen nor prevented, may ruin our submergence record.|$|E
60|$|And in {{that moment}} of agony, when my {{thoughts}} were full of his peril, I wrestled no longer with my secret; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> loved him. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> he was dear to me as no other man could be. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was {{face to face with}} a misery unchanging and unending.|$|R

60|$|<b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was right. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> no more loyal officer {{wore the}} uniform of the navy. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> was a good officer and sailor, and I didn't propose {{submitting}} to degradation and discharge {{because a lot of}} old, preglacial fossils had declared over two hundred years before that no man should cross thirty.|$|R
5|$|The {{argument}} that destruction and terror {{are part of}} revolution I do not dispute. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> in the past every great political and social change necessitated violence...Black slavery might still be a legalized institution in the United States but for the militant spirit of the John Browns. I have never denied that violence is inevitable, nor do I gainsay it now. Yet {{it is one thing}} to employ violence in combat, as a means of defense. It is quite another thing to make a principle of terrorism, to institutionalize it, to assign it the most vital place in the social struggle. Such terrorism begets counter-revolution and in turn itself becomes counter-revolutionary.|$|E

25|$|I {{suspect that}} I know {{more of the}} English class than any man in Britain.

Of this I am sure, that it is my own fault if they have not been a thousand. Nobody knows how they swarm, except those to whom they {{naturally}} resort. They are in all ranks and occupations, of all ages and characters. They are very earnest people, and their purpose is bona fide, the dissemination of their paradoxes. A great many — the mass, indeed — are illiterate, and a great many waste their means, and are in or approaching penury. These discoverers despise one another.|$|E
25|$|<b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> {{some people}} are getting very {{defensive}} about Black Swan and my role in it, but back-stabbing is not my purpose when people ask me about {{the legitimacy of the}} dance shots in the movie. I only care to speak the truth. The truth is that no one, not Natalie Portman, or even myself can come anywhere close {{to the level of a}} professional ballerina in a year and a half. Period. That doesn't mean that I don't admire Natalie and her acting. She is so talented and can inspire people, as well, with her own art form. She did an amazing job portraying her character in Black Swan. (Though the movie wasn't a completely realistic reflection of ballet or dancers.) My only wish is that Natalie, Darren, and certain others who worked closely on the movie could have grasped the beauty and the heart of true ballet. If they had, they would have advocated for this art more and given the real dancers the credit that they deserve.|$|E
25|$|The polite {{thing would}} be to say 'No comment'. But the truth is that... let's put it this way, you've never seen two actors more {{completely}} subservient and prostrate themselves {{at the feet of}} a director. Stanley was absolutely thrilled with the film. He was still working on the film when he died. And he probably died because he finally relaxed. It was one of the happiest weekends of his life, right before he died, after he had shown the first cut to Terry, Tom and Nicole. He would have kept working on it, like he did on all of his films. But <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> from people around him personally, my partner who was his assistant for thirty years. And I thought about R. Lee Ermey for In the Bedroom. And I talked to Stanley a lot about that film, and all I can say is Stanley was adamant that I shouldn't work with him for all kinds of reasons that I won't get into because {{there is no reason to}} do that to anyone, even if they are saying slanderous things that I know are completely untrue.|$|E

25|$|Dear friends, Citizens of Sukhumi and Georgia! Georgia {{is facing}} the most {{difficult}} days, especially Sukhumi. Separatists and foreign invaders entered into the city. I am proud of your courage... Separatists and opportunists will be judged by history... They do not want Georgians {{to live in this}} Georgian city. Many of them dream to repeat the Gagra tragedy here... <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> you understand the challenge we are facing. I know how difficult the situation is. Many people left the city but you remain here for Sukhumi and for Georgia.... I call on you, citizens of Sukhumi, fighters, officers and generals: I understand the difficulties of being in your position now, but we have no right to step back, we all have to hold our ground. We have to fortify the city and save Sukhumi. I would like to tell you that all of us – Government of Abkhazia, Cabinet of Ministers, Mr. Zhiuli Shartava, his colleagues, the city and regional government of Sukhumi, are prepared for action. The enemy is aware of our readiness, that's why he is fighting in the most brutal way to destroy our beloved Sukhumi. I call on you to keep peace, tenacity and self-control. We have to meet the enemy in our streets as they deserve.|$|E
25|$|Khalil Gibran's The Prophet is a {{book that}} has touched many people very deeply since its {{publishing}} in 1923. It has been translated into more than twenty languages, and the American edition alone {{has sold more than}} four million copies. It is considered both by Gibran himself, and by the general public to be his literary masterpiece. The Prophet is about a man who is leaving a small town called Orphalese where he has made his home for the past twelve years. He has, for that time period, been waiting for a boat to take him back to the land of his youth. We are not told where that land is, only that he has been waiting to return there for twelve years. The entire book occurs on the date of his departure. As he is about to leave, the townsfolk stop him in the town and request that he tell them about certain things. He talks to them about life's lessons and imparts his wisdom to them. He is asked about giving, and he tells the people to give without recognition, because their reward is their own joy. He also talks about things like marriage, work, friendship and also love. He speaks about each, and more, describing the way that people should deal with each issue. This book is an interesting book. It is ninety-three pages of life's lessons set down in writing. These are words to live by, and tell others to live by. This book is certainly a book that everyone should read. Even if people don't agree with some of the beliefs, they should still read the book, if only to get their mind thinking about life, and its many quandaries from a different perspective. This book is not unlike the musings of an aging man imparting his life's lessons to an audience of just about anyone whom he can gather to listen to him. I thoroughly enjoyed this book. Its lessons and stories are wise beyond the ages, and still hold up to be as true today as they were when Gibran wrote them in 1923. The lessons enumerated within this pages are lessons that one would hope were followed by the general population, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> if more people read this book, then {{the world as a whole}} might become a more easily survivable place.|$|E

500|$|Zhuangzi {{seems to}} have viewed death as a natural process or transformation, where one gives up one form of {{existence}} and assumes another.

How do <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>that</b> in hating death I am not like a man who, having left home in his youth, has forgotten the way back?"
