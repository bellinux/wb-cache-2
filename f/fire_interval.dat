5|$|Banksia cuneata lacks a lignotuber, so {{plants are}} killed by bushfire. However, this species is {{strongly}} serotinous: seed is released only following a fire. Thus plants accumulate an aerial seed bank in fire intervals, which is released all at once after a fire, ensuring population regeneration. The mechanism is a resin that seals the follicles shut, preventing dehiscence; {{the heat of a}} bushfire melts the resin, and the follicles open. Intense fires cause the immediate release of the seed and seed separator, but after cooler fires the seed separator often remains in place, blocking the follicle exit and preventing seed release. The wings on the seed separator are hygroscopic; they draw together when moistened, then reflex out again as they dry. Thus they lever themselves, and the seeds, out of the follicle over the course of one or more wet-dry cycles, ensuring that seed is released only after rain has fallen. The juvenile period for B.cuneata is around four years. Populations are very vulnerable to fire during this period, as fire will wipe out the entire population {{and there will be no}} seed from which it might recover. A model-based investigation found that the optimal <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> for maximising population size over the medium term is around 15 years. More frequent fires reduce population size by killing adults before they have reached their full fecundity. Less frequent fires reduce population size because there are fewer opportunities for seed dispersal and germination.

40|$|ABSTRACT: Adult non-sprouting {{chaparral}} {{species are}} killed by fire, relying on the germination of refractory seeds for post-fire reestablishment. An increase in fire frequency (<b>fire</b> return <b>intervals</b> of < 12 years) may prevent non-sprouting chaparral seedlings from reaching reproductive age, thus limiting recruitment prior to succeeding fires. A previous study found that a <b>fire</b> return <b>interval</b> of 6 years resulted in the localized extinction of the non-sprouting chaparral species Ceanothus megacarpus from a coastal site. We examined sites throughout the Santa Monica Mountains in southern California to determine if this pattern is generalized. We sampled 4 sites with <b>fire</b> return <b>intervals</b> of 6 years. Each site was matched to a nearby control site of similar slope aspect and elevation with a <b>fire</b> return <b>interval</b> of 12 years. We used a point-quarter sampling method for chaparral shrubs in tandem with a canopy-coverage sampling method for exotic weeds and grasses. Increased fire frequency reduced the frequency of non-sprouting chaparral shrubs, with shorter <b>fire</b> <b>intervals</b> having the greatest impact. Shorter <b>fire</b> <b>intervals</b> also increased gaps in the shrub matrix increasing the abundance of coastal sage scrub and non-native forbs and grasses. ...|$|R

50|$|If {{the area}} is undisturbed, the cedar will {{continue}} to grow well and other, more shade-tolerant species, will come in and form a dense canopy beneath it. The forest floor will then become dark, and young cedar, being relatively light demanding, will not flourish. It is only if there is further disturbance in the area which allows a lot of light to the forest floor that significant quantities of cedar will be able to establish itself. Thus, fire is an essential pre-requisite for dense, even, natural regeneration. The timing between fires is also critical. If fires are too frequent, the young trees will be killed before they can produce seed; if the fires are too infrequent the trees will die before space is created for their seeds to use. Generally it is said that a <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> between 100 and 200 years would be ideal. During recent years however, due to the increasing population of subsistence farmers {{around the base of the}} mountain, fires spreading up and over the mountain, especially in the dry season, have become more frequent.

30|$|Fire history {{research}} in coast redwood has produced high variability in <b>fire</b> return <b>intervals.</b> Early research estimated very long <b>fire</b> return <b>intervals</b> of 50 – 250 years (Veirs 1982) whereas more recent work has produced very frequent intervals of 6 – 15 years (Finney and Martin, 1989, 1992, Brown and Swetnam 1994, Brown et al. 1999, Brown and Baxter 2003).

However, the optimal <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> for minimising the risk of extinct in the long term is probably much longer.B. cuneata is very unusual in apparently suffering no seed loss due to granivory. In nearly all other species, burrowing insect larvae eat a large proportion of seeds, and birds cause further losses in breaking open cones in search of larvae to eat. The seed-eating insects are mostly species-specific, and it appears that no insect species has adapted to B. cuneata. Possible reasons for this are the very low seed counts, and the rarity of the species, both of which offer little incentive for adaptation to the species. There is also no evidence of granivores feeding on seed after it has fallen. As a result, this species has the highest rate of seed viability recorded for a Banksia species: in one study, 74% of all seed produced in the previous 12 years was viable. This was largely accounted for by seed under 9 years old, about 90% of which is viable. After the ninth year, viability is lost rapidly as the follicles decay and senescence sets in. Seed production itself starts very slowly. On average, plants aged between 5 and 12 years have about 18 seeds stored in their canopy. Storage increases exponentially, however, and 25-year-old plants often have tens of thousands of seeds. Seed production probably never plateaus. In fact, by the time a plant is twenty years old it has accumulated such a great weight of cones that major branches begin to break away; and by the age of thirty, plants have broken branches more often than not. As plants age, branch breakage increasingly leads to plant death, and it is unlikely that any plants live to more than 45 years.|$|E

30|$|<b>Fire</b> <b>interval</b> {{statistics}} {{have been}} used for decades to describe surface fire regimes recorded by fire scarred trees (Agee 1993, Baker and Ehle 2001). Mean <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> (MFI) is commonly used to estimate fire frequency (Agee 1993, Heyerdahl 1997, Baker and Ehle 2001). A mean point <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> (MPFI) is calculated from a single tree, indicating fire frequency at that point (Agee 1993). The MPFI is susceptible to false negatives (Kilgore and Taylor 1979, Fall 1999, Baker and Ehle 2001), as fires may not be recorded or scars may be lost by subsequent fires, so this measurement may overestimate <b>fire</b> <b>interval.</b> Sampling several trees in close proximity, averaging the MPFIs, and treating them as a point (Agee 1993) may help address such false negatives. However, a tree or a cluster of trees only records fire at a single location on the landscape, and may not represent broader areas.

40|$|Abstract. Accurate fire-history {{data are}} needed if local {{management}} of fire or costly national plans for restoring and managing fire and forest structure are to succeed. Fire-history researchers often use fire scars and the composite <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> method to reconstruct parameters of past fire regimes, {{such as the}} population mean <b>fire</b> <b>interval,</b> but the composite method has serious limitations. We modified an alternative non-composite <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> method, the individual-tree fire-interval method, to derive a more accurate new method, the all-tree fire-interval method. A stochastic fire-scar generating model to assess {{the accuracy of the}} new method and its predecessors was then used. Three factors (scarring ratio, population mean <b>fire</b> <b>interval,</b> and tree age) that affect accuracy were varied in the model runs. More complexity (trees with varied scarring ratio between the first scar and successive scars) also was modelled to test the robustness of the method. The all-tree fire-interval method was shown to greatly improve accuracy and provide unbiased estimates of the population mean <b>fire</b> <b>interval.</b> The method also produced encouraging results when scarring was more complex. The new all-tree fire-interval method will require further research on the rates at which trees are scarred by fire, but this would be generally beneficial to understanding fire history...|$|E
40|$|The time {{interval}} between stand-replacing fires can influence patterns of initial postfire succession if {{the abundance of}} postfire propagules varies with prefire stand age. We examined the effect of <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> on initial postfire lodgepole pine (Pinus contorta var. latifolia Engelm.) density in Yellowstone National Park (YNP) following the 1988 fires. We asked whether postfire propagule abundance, measured as prefire percent serotiny, varied with <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> and could explain patterns in postfire succession. The response of lodgepole pine density to variation in <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> was explained by spatial and temporal variation in prefire serotiny. At low elevations, postfire lodgepole pine recruitment correlated strongly with prefire percent serotiny, which varied nonlinearly with prefire stand age. As a result, postfire lodgepole pine densities varied nonlinearly with <b>fire</b> <b>interval.</b> In contrast, at high elevations serotiny was low, varied little with stand age and did not influence postfire lodgepole pine densities, although, <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> was still {{a significant predictor of}} postfire densities. At high elevations, <b>fire</b> <b>interval</b> varied nonlinearly with postfire lodgepole densities, presumably due to the temporal variation in propagule abundance from open cones in adjacent unburned stands. Temporal variation in stand-level serotiny at low elevations was best explained by age of individual trees. Logistic regression indicated that trees expected to be serotinous had a low probability of exhibiting serotiny at a young age, with increasing probability as trees matured up to 140 yr. This increase in serotiny with tree age likely accounts for the initial increase in stand-level percent serotiny with stand age at low elevations. The spatial variation in serotiny was correlated with variation in historical fire regimes. <b>Fire</b> <b>interval</b> models derived from lower elevations in YNP indicate that fire occurred historically at 135 – 185 -yr intervals, whereas at higher elevations fires occurred at 280 – 310 -yr intervals.
