5|$|When at rest, {{the wings}} are held {{over the back}} in most insects, which may involve {{longitudinal}} folding of the wing membrane and sometimes also transverse folding. Folding may sometimes occur along the flexion lines. Though <b>fold</b> lines may be transverse, as in the hindwings of beetles and earwigs, they are normally radial {{to the base of}} the wing, allowing adjacent sections of a wing to be folded over or under each other. The commonest <b>fold</b> line is the jugal <b>fold,</b> situated just behind the third anal vein, although, most Neoptera have a jugal <b>fold</b> just behind vein 3A on the forewings. It is sometimes also present on the hindwings. Where the anal area of the hindwing is large, as in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the whole of this part may be folded under the anterior part of the wing along a vannal <b>fold</b> a little posterior to the claval furrow. In addition, in Orthoptera and Blattodea, the anal area is folded like a fan along the veins, the anal veins being convex, at the crests of the folds, and the accessory veins concave. Whereas the claval furrow and jugal <b>fold</b> are probably homologous in different species, the vannal <b>fold</b> varies in position in different taxa. Folding is produced by a muscle arising on the pleuron and inserted into the third axillary sclerite in such a way that, when it contracts, the sclerite pivots about its points of articulation with the posterior notal process and the second axillary sclerite.|$|E

5|$|When {{bound to}} a protein, NAD and NADH are usually held within a {{structural}} motif {{known as the}} Rossmann <b>fold.</b> The motif is named after Michael Rossmann {{who was the first}} scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins. This <b>fold</b> contains three or more parallel beta strands linked by two alpha helices in the order beta-alpha-beta-alpha-beta. This forms a beta sheet flanked by a layer of alpha helices on each side. Because each Rossmann <b>fold</b> binds one nucleotide, binding domains for NAD consist of two paired Rossmann folds, with each <b>fold</b> binding one of the two nucleotides of the cofactor.

40|$|Recent {{studies in}} protein <b>folding</b> suggest that native state {{topology}} plays a dominant {{role in determining}} the <b>folding</b> mechanism, yet an analogous statement has not been made for RNA, most likely due to the strong coupling between the ionic environment and conformational energetics that make RNA <b>folding</b> more complex than protein <b>folding.</b> Applying a distributed computing architecture to sample nearly 5000 complete tRNA <b>folding</b> events using a minimalist, atomistic model, we have characterized the role of native topology in tRNA <b>folding</b> dynamics: the simulated bulk <b>folding</b> behavior predicts well the experimentally observed <b>folding</b> mechanism. In contrast, single-molecule <b>folding</b> events display multiple discrete <b>folding</b> transitions and compose a largely diverse, heterogeneous dynamic ensemble.

40|$|We {{investigated}} {{the impact of}} hydrodynamic interactions (HI) on protein <b>folding</b> using a coarse-grained model. The extent {{of the impact of}} hydrodynamic interactions, whether it accelerates, retards, or has no effect on protein <b>folding,</b> has been controversial. Together with a theoretical framework of the energy landscape theory (ELT) for protein <b>folding</b> that describes the dynamics of the collective motion with a single reaction coordinate across a <b>folding</b> barrier, we compared the kinetic effects of HI on the <b>folding</b> rates of two protein models that use a chain of single beads with distinctive topologies: a 64 -residue alpha/beta chymotrypsin inhibitor 2 (CI 2) protein, and a 57 -residue beta-barrel alpha-spectrin src-Homology 3 domain (SH 3) protein. When comparing the protein <b>folding</b> kinetics simulated with Brownian dynamics in the presence of HI to that in the absence of HI, we find that the effect of HI on protein <b>folding</b> appears to have a crossover behavior about the <b>folding</b> temperature. Meaning that at a temperature greater than the <b>folding</b> temperature, the enhanced friction from the hydrodynamic solvents between the beads in an unfolded configuration results in lowered <b>folding</b> rate; conversely, at a temperature lower than the <b>folding</b> temperature, HI accelerates <b>folding</b> by the backflow of solvent toward the native <b>folded</b> state. Additionally, the extent of acceleration depends on the topology of a protein: for a protein like CI 2, where its <b>folding</b> nucleus is rather diffuse in a transition state, HI channels the formation of contacts by favoring a major <b>folding</b> pathway in a complex free energy landscape, thus accelerating <b>folding.</b> For a protein like SH 3, where its <b>folding</b> nucleus is already specific and less diffuse, HI matters less at a temperature lower than the <b>folding</b> temperature. Our findings provide further theoretical insight to protein <b>folding</b> kinetic experiments and simulations. Comment: 11 figure...|$|R
