Primary constraints on the CTE correction algorithm are provided by estimates of CTE losses using CCD spectra of spectrophotometric standard stars. For point-source spectra taken at the standard reference position {{at the center of}} the detector, the algorithm corrects CTE losses as large as 30 % to within ∼ 1. 5 % RMS throughout the wavelength range covered by the first-order CCD modes. This uncertainty is similar to the Poisson noise associated with a resolution element of a spectrum with an extracted signal level of about 2500 electrons per pixel.

By analyzing data for the most commonly used first order spectral modes, we have determined that the traces have been systemat-ically rotating over time. We have delivered spectral trace reference files that apply the calibrated rotation to the most commonly used modes. We have also produced a PyRAF routine, MKTRACE, that measures the tilt of the trace in a science image and produces a corrected trace reference file for that image. Using corrected traces, we have analyzed the flux calibration of L grating spectra extracted with small boxes. We find substantial errors in the spectral shape of small-box extractions of G 430 L spectra due to uncali-brated systematic wavelength-dependent variability of the point spread function, which becomes broader at long wavelengths as it becomes narrower at short wavelengths. 1...|$|R

30|$|This paper {{presents}} hybrid {{feature extraction}} and GA based feature selection for off-line {{handwritten character recognition}} by using adaptive MLPNN classifier for achieving an improved overall performance on real world recognition problems. Seven approaches of feature <b>extraction</b> namely, <b>box</b> method, diagonal distance method, mean and gradient operation, standard deviation, centre of gravity and edge detection {{have been used to}} develop an off-line character recognition system. Two different recognition networks are built namely Adaptive MLP classifier without feature reduction and Adaptive MLP classifier with feature reduction. The network is trained and tested on the CEDAR CDROM- 1 dataset. It can be concluded from the experimental results that the network which uses GA based feature selection method improves over all performance of the recognition system in terms of speed and storage requirement. It has also been verified that the proposed adaptive MLP Neural Network works as a better classifier and provides better accuracy.|$|R
40|$|Due to {{the effects}} of gain sag on flux on the COS FUV {{microchannel}} plate detector, the COS FUV spectra will be moved in February 2015 to a pristine location on the detector, from Lifetime Position 2 (LP 2) to LP 3. The spectra will be shifted in the cross-dispersion (XD) direction by - 2. 5 ", about - 31 pixels, from the original LP 1. In contrast, LP 2 was shifted by + 3. 5 ", about 41 pixels, from LP 1. By reducing the LP 3 -LP 1 separation compared to the LP 2 -LP 1 separation, we achieve maximal spectral resolution at LP 3 while preserving more detector area for future lifetime positions. In the current version of the COS boxcar extraction algorithm, flux is summed within a box of fixed height that is larger than the PSF. Bad pixels located anywhere within the <b>extraction</b> <b>box</b> cause the entire column to be discarded. At the new LP 3 position the current <b>extraction</b> <b>box</b> will overlap with LP 1 regions of low gain (pixels which have lost > 5 % of their sensitivity). As a result, large portions of spectra will be discarded, even though these flagged pixels will be located in the wings of the profiles and contain a negligible fraction of the total source flux. To avoid unnecessarily discarding columns affected by such pixels, an algorithm is needed that can judge whether the effects of gain-sagged pixels on the extracted flux are significant. The "two-zone" solution adopted for pipeline use was tailored specifically for the COS FUV data characteristics: First, using a library of 1 -D spectral centroid ("trace") locations, residual geometric distortions in the XD direction are removed. Next, 2 -D template profiles are aligned with the observed spectral image. Encircled energy contours are calculated and an inner zone that contains 80 % of the flux is defined, as well as an outer zone that contains 99 % of the flux. With this approach, only pixels flagged as bad in the inner 80 % zone will cause columns to be discarded while flagged pixels in the outer zones do not affect extraction. Finally, all good columns are summed in the XD direction to obtain a 1 -D extracted spectrum. We present examples of the trace and profile libraries that are used in the two-zone extraction and compare the performance of the two-zone and boxcar algorithms. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|LecturePg. 57 - 66 To {{compete in}} today?s {{economic}} climate, petrochemical plants are strategizing on continuous long-term operation to reduce maintenance costs and increase productivity. This strategy {{has led some}} plants to go from eight years between turnarounds to 10 years. For rotating machinery such as mechanical-drive steam turbines, one factor that affects this strategy is heavy deposition on steam turbine internals, caused by impurities in the steam. These impurities results in fouling on the blade and nozzle path surfaces due to contaminated materials such as silica and sodium in the steam. As a result, turbine performance tends to deteriorate gradually. This paper introduces an innovative online washing technique to minimize the impact cause by fouling of the steam path for large multistage condensing steam turbines. This technique, although applied here to extracting-condensing turbines, is also applicable to large condensing turbines. The new technology has water injection nozzles location in the steam chest of the extraction valve rack. The injection nozzles are manifold to a water supply source, which controls a set point temperature, by controlling the water injection rate. The objective is to directly wash off deposits adhering to the blades and nozzles on the low-pressure side with minimal power turndown, and without impacting the turbine?s long-term performance. Erosion damage and thermal stress of internal parts such as chest valves and blades due to the injected water {{had to be taken}} into consideration. To properly achieve this objective, and considering the potential for damage during the online wash, a new extraction valve box had to be designed. The new design had to consider the effects of optimizing the mixing zone of the steam and water injection to generate a specific particle size, moisture propagation through condensing section, mechanical deflection of stationary components, and the overall thermodynamic analysis of each stage during the online wash. A prototype model was built and several experiments carried out based on the practical operating condition of actual steam turbines. This paper discusses the evaluations made from the model, by presenting the thermodynamic analysis results, and the finite element analysis (FEA) that was used to evaluate the strength of the internal parts during actual online washing. The final design was a compact <b>extraction</b> <b>box</b> that could replace existing models without any machining of the casing. To date there are two such installations worldwide. These are operating effectively without incident.

30|$|Compared {{with the}} {{traditional}} method, Ren et al. proposed a new approach, named by Faster-RCNN (faster region-based convolutional neural network) [11]. Regarding structure, Faster-RCNN has integrated feature extraction, proposal <b>extraction,</b> bounding <b>box</b> regression (rectangular refine), and classification into a network. It leads to a significant improvement in overall performance and detection speed. R-FCN is another target detection structure proposed by [12]. It modified the previous Faster-RCNN structure by moving the convolutions {{to the front of}} the ROI layer. R-FCN used a position-sensitive feature map to evaluate the probability of each category and was thus more accurate in positioning. Although the detection rate was improved, R-FCN cannot recognize the specific contour of the target. Due to this drawback, R-FCN has a limited range of application. Mask R-CNN was proposed by K. He [13], a researcher of Facebook AI, in 2017. This method expands the object detection technology and achieves pixel-level segmentation and contour segmentation of targets by using bilinear interpolation. Law method, proposed by [14], reduced the loss of space symmetry and has better recognition effect in scenes with a transparent background and foreground segmentation. However, it does not have sufficient adaptability to power component scenes with many interference factors and cannot fully exploit the image’s associated information.|$|R

40|$|Heterogeneous N 2 O 5 uptake onto aerosol is {{the primary}} nocturnal path for removal of NO x (= NO+NO 2) from the {{atmosphere}} and can also result in halogen activation through production of ClNO 2. The N 2 O 5 uptake coefficient {{has been the subject}} of numerous laboratory studies; however, only a few studies have determined the uptake coefficient from ambient measurements, and none has been focused on winter conditions, when the portion of NO x removed by N 2 O 5 uptake is the largest. In this work, N 2 O 5 uptake coefficients are determined from ambient wintertime measurements of N 2 O 5 and related species at the Boulder Atmospheric Observatory in Weld County, CO, a location that is highly impacted by urban pollution from Denver, as well as emissions from agricultural activities and oil and gas <b>extraction.</b> A <b>box</b> model is used to analyze the nocturnal nitrate radical chemistry and predict the N 2 O 5 concentration. The uptake coefficient in the model is iterated until the predicted N 2 O 5 concentration matches the measured concentration. The results suggest that during winter, the most important influence that might suppress N 2 O 5 uptake is aerosol nitrate but that this effect does not suppress uptake coefficients enough to limit the rate of NO x loss through N 2 O 5 hydrolysis. N 2 O 5 hydrolysis was found to dominate the nocturnal chemistry during this study consuming ~ 80 % of nocturnal gas phase nitrate radical production.

40|$|Accurate {{detection}} {{of objects in}} 3 D point clouds is a central problem in many applications, such as autonomous navigation, housekeeping robots, and augmented/virtual reality. To interface a highly sparse LiDAR point cloud with a region proposal network (RPN), most existing efforts have focused on hand-crafted feature representations, for example, a bird's eye view projection. In this work, we remove the need of manual feature engineering for 3 D point clouds and propose VoxelNet, a generic 3 D detection network that unifies feature <b>extraction</b> and bounding <b>box</b> prediction into a single stage, end-to-end trainable deep network. Specifically, VoxelNet divides a point cloud into equally spaced 3 D voxels and transforms a group of points within each voxel into a unified feature representation through the newly introduced voxel feature encoding (VFE) layer. In this way, the point cloud is encoded as a descriptive volumetric representation, which is then connected to a RPN to generate detections. Experiments on the KITTI car detection benchmark show that VoxelNet outperforms the state-of-the-art LiDAR based 3 D detection methods by a large margin. Furthermore, our network learns an effective discriminative representation of objects with various geometries, leading to encouraging results in 3 D {{detection of}} pedestrians and cyclists, based on only LiDAR...|$|R
40|$|International audienceAccording to the Center for Research and Prevention of Injuries report, fall-caused {{injuries}} {{of elderly}} people in UE- 27 are five times as frequent as other injury causes which reduce considerably their mobility and independence. Among the diverse applications of computer vision systems, object detection and event recognition are {{of the most prominent}} related recognition and motion analysis, that is, researchers had the idea to spread it in fall detection. The fall event, extracted automatically from the video scene represents itself, crucial information {{that can be used to}} alert emergency. In this context, visual information on the corresponding scene is highly important in order to take the "right" decision. Therefore, video compression may be included into the acquisition system to reduce data-bandwidth. Meanwhile, detecting such particular situations allows the video compression to be controlled. For instance, the compression can be reduced after a fall to provide more details on the scene or specific compression rates can be applied on the background and the regions of interest. The video codec should be able to adjust its coding performances (bit-rate, PSNR) according to the detected events into the video scene. For reaching such flexibility, we propose to focus on a key processing stage: the motion estimation. Ideally, a smart camera which embedded a fall detection method as well as an adaptive video codec would be very significant solution for this field. We propose two key elements for the design of such system: a robust fall detection method and a configurable motion estimation accelerator. The fall detection method is based on basic feature <b>extraction</b> (bounding <b>box</b> aspect ratio and position best fitting ellipse characteristics, etc.) from robust tracking algorithm, followed by a SVM classifier and a final decision stage. We evaluated the robustness of our method using a realistic dataset and we evaluated the ability of some standard transformations to improve the classification performances. Experiments show that the best result (specificify= 0. 99984, accuracy= 0. 99822, precision = 0. 94737 and recall= 0. 9), is obtained combining the Fast Fourier Transform, the Wavelet transform and the first derivative, i. e. the velocity of the first level feature.

40|$|This MSc thesis aims {{to develop}} a {{management}} solution for historical Automatic Identification Structure (AIS) data by finding a suitable database and data(base) structure for an effective extraction of historical AIS data to support Spatial-Temporal analyses. The work-flow the thesis proposes focusses on {{the selection of a}} database, the organization of the data inside this database and the effectiveness of the extraction of information {{that can be used in}} Spatial-Temporal analyses. AIS data, vessel movement data, has a complex structure consisting of 27 different kind of encoded messages. These messages hold their own unique and similar data and are related to each other by their vessel-ID number (MMSI). The update rate of the messages, the data, is dynamic, different for each kind of message. Storing and structuring historic AIS data should be able to handle the data features. Based on the comparison between the AIS data features, the requirements that the database has to meet which are set by Rijkswaterstaat and related literature and documentation is MongoDB a suitable database to manage AIS data. The requirements that are set by Rijkswaterstaat are based on three use cases; location, trajectory and bounding <b>box.</b> <b>Extraction</b> of the information, that can answer the use cases, from the historic AIS data that is stored within the database, should be effective. To ensure this, two data(base) organizations are developed, one storing AIS data in a way that it will support the Spatial-Temporal analyses of the specified use cases and one storing AIS data in a way that it will support all possible spatial-temporal use cases. The first will store only the four decoded attributes that are necessary to answer the use cases together with the original encoded AIS message. The second will store all decoded attributes an AIS message holds. To enhance the performance of MongoDB holding AIS data in one of the two data(base) organization, four indexes on individual attributes and one 4 D Morton code index are developed. A 4 D Morton code index based on latitude, longitude, MMSI and date-time is developed to enhance the effectiveness of the extraction of the information from the database that will answer the three use cases. A comparison between the two data(base) organizations and the five indexes by measuring their effectiveness while executing three, on the by Rijkswaterstaat specified use cases based, queries, concludes on a suitable management solution for historical AIS data which will support Spatial-Temporal analyses.
