2500|$|As {{the skill}} set {{of those in}} the {{ambulance}} increased, so did the importance of information.

[...] Priority codes developed for ambulance dispatch, and became commonplace, although they have never been fully standardized. [...] As it became possible for those in the ambulance to actually save lives, the process of sending the closest appropriate resource to the person in the greatest need became very important. Dispatchers needed tools to help them make the correct decisions, and a number of products initially competed to provide that decision-support.|$|E

It was music to my ears, maybe nobody else's. But to me? I couldn't believe it. It's so twisted and dark and fucked up. That's why I'm on the show because I love stuff like that." ...|$|E
