50|$|At {{that time}} British {{space-heating}} techniques were {{a long way}} behind those of Scandinavia. However, decommissioned coal pits, rising fuel prices and severe environmental restrictions had overtaken the old and charming coal fireplace. Qualified <b>heating</b> <b>engineers</b> and new ideas were needed, so the opportunities for mechanical engineers from the Continent were obvious. A further reason why they succeeded so quickly in the U.K. and Ireland {{was that they were}} no doubt riding on a wave of goodwill created by Danish architects whose work received much attention in architectural circles there.|$|R

50|$|<b>Heating</b> <b>engineers</b> {{will usually}} {{do this as}} part of the {{installation}} of a brand new system but they will rarely do it when replacing a component of the system, such as just the room thermostat or a part inside the boiler.

50|$|An ASTM Smoke Pump, or 'spot pump', is an {{instrument}} for evaluating the dark particle concentration of a smoke.

It consists of a cylinder of precise size down which a close-fitting piston is pulled, sucking {{a sample of the}} smoke through a small nozzle against a filter paper (equivalent to Whatman No2 paper) so that a 'spot' is formed on the paper, the darkness of which can be compared with a standard chart to indicate the concentration of smoke.|$|R
