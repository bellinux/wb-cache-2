40|$|With {{the focus}} of {{psychiatric}} care now firmly in the community {{there has been a}} steady reduction of costly in-patient beds along with the emergence of the community recovery model. 1, 2 The benchmark of successful patient management now includes reduced hospital usage. The management of psychiatric patients in the community enables greater patient autonomy. This, however, also results in some patients disengaging and relapsing, leading to repeated admissions with poorer clinical outcomes as well as greater financial stress on the healthcare system. In addition, the media’s portrayal of psychiatric patients as dangerous led to a call for greater scrutiny of community care under legal jurisdiction by the political establish-ment. 3, 4 In 1998 the government started the process of reforming the mental health law in <b>England</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wale...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{explores the}} links between {{biosecurity}} policy and rural differentiation. It attempts to show how biosecurity policy has been fundamentally affected by uncertainty over {{the rules of the}} game of policy-making – what Hajer has called the ‘institutional void’. In particular, the article attempts to show how this void has created a new political space in which the traditional practices of dealing with animal disease have been challenged and reshaped. Crucial to this is a discourse of partnership that permits new actors and forms of expertise to construct different approaches to biosecurity at new spatial scales. These actions legitimate a new spatiality of disease control, thereby contributing to the differentiation of the countryside.

40|$|Pregnancy {{in women}} aged 45 or older is unusual. Of the 4. 1 million births in the USA in 2004, only 6122 were to women aged 45 or more. 1 In the UK, births {{to women in}} this age group are not {{reported}} separately, but rather are lumped in with births to women over 40. Published data tell us little about women who fall pregnant at this late stage in their reproductive lives. The group will include women who conceive spontaneously {{as well as those who}} have undergone assisted reproduction. It will include women for whom pregnancy is a mistake, as well as those who choose to get pregnant. In a review of 1865 pregnancies among Danish women aged 45 or older who conceived between 1978 and 1992, it was reported that the majority (1184; 63 %) ended in induced abortion. 2 In <b>England</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wale...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to compare the average levels of air {{pollution}} present in different areas of Belfast during the five-year period commencing 1 st January, 1961, and to examine these levels in relation to the mortality rates from bronchitis which occurred in the central and in the peripheral wards or part-wards of the city during the same five-year period. An assessment is made of the smoking habits of persons resident in Belfast and the effects of these smoking habits upon mortality from bronchitis is discussed. In the International Statistical Classification of Diseases, Bronchitis (LCD. No. 500 - 502) comprises three disease groups, namely Acute bronchitis, Unqualified bronchitis and Chronic bronchitis (LCD. No. 500, 501 and 502 respectively).

40|$|The Community Service Order (CSO) in Malaysia: An Exploration of the Perceptions and Experiences of Supervisors and Offenders. This {{qualitative}} study centres on the Community Service Order (CSO), a sentencing tool recently introduced in Malaysia {{which is used}} {{as an alternative to}} custodial punishment for young first time offenders (trainees) of minor crimes. The research uses in-depth interviews and questionnaires to document the experiences of a sample of youthful offenders and those who have completed the sentencing. The study also captures the views of the practitioners of CSO in Malaysia. The study shows despite its minor drawback there are many positive sides of CSO and its potential as practised in Malaysia. In its current form there are opportunities for improvement in terms of staff training and providing better supervision as well as rehabilitation of the trainees. The study provides glimpses into the criminal behaviour of the offending youth which could provide useful opportunity for future research and extension of CSO implementation. The findings of this study concur with similar studies on the effectiveness of CSO as a genuine alternative to imprisonment for young offenders such {{as in the case of}} countries like Singapore, <b>England</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wale...</b>|$|R
40|$|This article {{provides}} an in-depth {{analysis of the}} Crimes Amendment (Abolition of Defensive Homicide) Act 2014 which had the effect of repealing Victoria’s only general ‘partial defence’ of defensive homicide, and replaced the existing statutory self-defence in murder/manslaughter provisions and general common law self- defence rules with a single test. The abolition of defensive homicide means there is now no general ‘partial defence’ to accommodate cases falling short of self-defence. The change is likely to mean that some primary victims will find themselves bereft of a defence. This is the experience in New Zealand where the Family Violence Death Review Committee recently recommended the reintroduction of a partial defence, post-abolition of provocation in 2009. Primary victims in New Zealand are being convicted of murder and sentences are double those issued pre- 2009. An entirely new defence predicated on a fear of serious violence and several threshold filter mechanisms designed to accommodate the circumstances of primary victims is advanced. The proposed framework draws upon earlier recommendations of the Law Commission for <b>England</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wale,</b> <b>and</b> a comprehensive review of the operation of ss 54 and 55 of the Coroners and Justice Act 2009, but the novel framework rejects the paradoxical loss of self-control requirement and sexed normative standard operating within that jurisdiction. The recommendations are complemented by social framework evidence and mandatory jury directions, modelled on the law in Victoria. A novel interlocutory appeal procedure designed to prevent unnecessary appellate court litigation is also outlined. This bespoke model provides an appropriate via media and optimal solution to the problems faced by primary victims in Victoria and New Zealand...|$|R

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to report the {{findings}} from research into the outcomes of adult protection in Scotland, with particular focus on how service users, family members and service delivery professionals perceive the effectiveness of the protection orders in the Adult Support and Protection (Scotland) Act 2007. Design/methodology/approach – The study comprised analysis of Adult Protection Committee biennial reports on implementation of the 2007 Act to the Scottish Government, key informant interviews and workshops with professionals involved in adult protection leadership and practice, and case study interviews with service users, family members and practitioners. Findings – Concerns about the potential for paternalistic practice and excessive use of the protection orders within the 2007 Act have not materialised. The principle of proportionality appears to be firmly embedded in adult protection practice. Service delivery professionals, service users and family members remain acutely aware of the tensions between autonomy and protection but point to beneficial outcomes for adults at risk from the careful use of protection orders, especially banning orders. Research limitations/implications – Only ten case studies were able to be included in the study. However, the use of mixed methods enabled triangulation of the findings. Common themes emerge from across the data sources. The findings also resonate with conclusions drawn by other researchers. Practical implications – The paper identifies outcomes and challenges in respect of protecting adults at risk in Scotland. Strengths and limitations of the 2007 Act are identified. Originality/value – The paper offers a formal evaluation of the outcome of protection orders for adults at risk in Scotland. The findings are of wider policy relevance given the debates on how to legislate for adult safeguarding in <b>England</b> <b>and</b> <b>Wale...</b>|$|R
40|$|Aim: This paper aims {{to explore}} notions of {{confidence}} and risk {{in the context of}} professional knowledge and practice for trainee teachers in the lifelong learning sector. It will argue that the inculcation of confidence through risk-taking is an imperative for an emancipatory journey into praxis. Content: This paper explores notions {{of confidence and}} risk in the context of professional knowledge and practice for teachers in the lifelong learning sector. It draws upon Marianna Papastephanou’s (2006 and forthcoming), work on school teachers and discourse, who argues for the “accommodation of risk in the teacher–pupil relationship and against the managerial narrowing of educational endeavour to the sphere of the secure and the predictable” (2006 : p 48). She also raises important points about risk in education more generally, “What is missing from such discourses is the acknowledgement of unpredictability and non-calculability (true risk, that is) as an inherent, disruptive and creative force of teaching and learning, as many educational philosophers have convincingly pointed out” (2006 : p 50). In this respect confidence, whether imbued in the self or inculcated by the processes and products of continuing professional development, correlates with both the developing teacher’s capacity to take risks and their vulnerability when submitting to both course assessment and work-based audits of practice. The paper suggests a tension between learner participation in a higher education course of study, and corresponding participation in skills development in the workplace for trainee teachers, whether on placement or in-service. In this respect the nature of professional knowledge and practice, confidence, and work based learning (WBL) are discussed. This paper will argue that the inculcation of confidence through risk-taking is an imperative for the journey into praxis. The role of HE in teacher education: It explores the tension between learner participation in a higher education course of study, and corresponding participation in skills development in the workplace. While the focus is on teacher education in the Lifelong Learning sector, colleagues in the school sector will recognise these tensions, and the discussions relating to confidence and risk for trainee teachers and their journey into praxis. Hoped for impact on practice: It is hoped that the discussions will cause colleagues to strive for a greater emphasis on the inculcation of confidence and risk-taking between the workplace (placement or in-service), and the teacher education curriculum as an imperative for an emancipatory journey into praxis.
