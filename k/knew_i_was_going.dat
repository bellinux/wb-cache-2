But I just sat back and laughed at the opposition, with their swearing and 'traitor' remarks... some of them can hardly speak English. My affiliation is with England. In fact, I'm starting to speak too much like Darren Gough... In fact, I'm going to get one of Gough's tattoos with three lions and my number underneath...No one can say I'm not English.|$|E

[...] David Koepp said: [...] "I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get hammered {{from a number of}} quarters [...] what I liked about the way the movie ended up playing was it was popular with families. I like that families really embraced it." [...] Although Spielberg said [...] "I'm very happy with the movie. I always have been", he also said [...] "I sympathise with people who didn't like the MacGuffin [...] because I never liked the MacGuffin." ...|$|E

The episode features guest star Tracey Ellis as the titular Audrey Pauley. Ellis had previously appeared as a major character in the third season episode [...] "Oubliette". Annabeth Gish later noted that the episode, along with [...] "4-D", were her [...] "two favorite episodes" [...] because they [...] "are stand-alone episodes about Reyes and Doggett. Wonderful acting challenges, and the stories were fantastic." [...] Robert Patrick, whose friend Ted Demme had recently died, was worried about bringing too much emotion onto the set. He later noted, [...] "I was kind of raw. I remember being a little worried about bringing too much emotion to it. I felt safe with Kim; he <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> through a tough time." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{democracy}} {{produced the}} adrenalin of something new, something was occurring, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{to make changes}} without knowing how.

He became the [...] "first kid in his elementary school to turn in an assignment from a word processor". His older brother also taught him to take things apart and before long he was taking [...] "everything in his house apart to see how it worked". He said that [...] "from a very early age, I also realized I wanted to invent things. So I became really interested in technology and business. Probably from when I was 12, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to start a company eventually." ...|$|E
2500|$|Stern met {{his first}} wife, Alison Berns, while at Boston University through a mutual friend. He used Berns {{in a student}} film he made about Transcendental Meditation. Stern wrote, [...] "Within a week after our {{relationship}} began, I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to marry her." [...] They married at Temple Ohabei Shalom in Brookline, Massachusetts, on June 4, 1978; both were 24 years old. They have three daughters: Emily Beth (b. 1983), Debra Jennifer (b. 1986), and Ashley Jade (b. 1993). In October 1999, they decided to separate. Stern said, [...] "I was totally neurotic and sort of consumed with work. I took work {{as the most important}} thing and the only thing." [...] He moved from the home he shared with Berns in Old Westbury, New York into a 4,000-square-foot apartment in Millennium Tower in the Upper West Side of Manhattan which he bought in 1998 for $4.9 million. The marriage ended in 2001 with an amicable divorce and settlement.|$|E

2500|$|Once in the lead, Barrichello quickly {{opened up}} a {{considerable}} gap back to Schumacher, and by his first pit stop on Lap 27, he led by 12.5 seconds. He returned from the pits in fifth place, behind the two McLarens, as Schumacher returned to the lead. Montoya, meanwhile, was flying as his Michelin tires began to gain traction and provide him an advantage. On Lap 34, just a lap after nearly losing control in Turn 4, Montoya took the lead by outbraking Schumacher down the inside of Turn 1 {{as they approached the}} Minardi of Alex Yoong. [...] "I was trying to get close enough coming into the straight," [...] Montoya said later, [...] "and that time I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to get close enough because of traffic. I just went for it." [...] Michael Schumacher said later, [...] "I don't know where he came from." [...] Almost immediately, Montoya built a 2.3-second advantage, recording the fastest lap of the race before pitting on Lap 36 and returning in fifth. Once again, Schumacher led, this time from Häkkinen, with neither car having visited the pits.|$|E
2500|$|At the 6 June Bislett Games in Oslo, a Golden League event, Tirunesh Dibaba set a {{world record}} in the 5000 metres, running the {{distance}} in 14:11.15. Lucy Wangui Kabuu from Kenya ran a personal best and finished in second place, 22 seconds behind Dibaba. Tirunesh's sister Ejegayehu Dibaba finished in third place {{with a time of}} 14:36.78 (4.04 seconds off her personal best). Dibaba bettered Meseret Defar's world record by 5.48 seconds. Tirunesh said after the race, [...] "I've been thinking about {{this for a long time}} and this is a very special day for me. I was trying my best, and I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to break the record with two laps to go. The early part of the race was pretty good, but at 3000 metres we were a little behind, so then I had to catch up on the pace. I could have run faster if the pacing was a little better." [...] Tirunesh's 800 metre split times were: 2:13.7 - 2:19.0 (4:32.7 through 1600 metres) - 2:22.5 (6:55.2 through 2400 metres and 8:03.7 through 2800 metres) - 2:17.8 (9:13.0 through 3200 metres) - 2:15.4 (11:28.4 through 4000 metres)- 2:10.1 (13.38.5 though 4800 metres), with a last 200 metre split of 32.7.|$|E

6000|$|... "The matter doesn't end here," [...] {{the latter}} remarked. [...] "There's {{something}} to be said that your father ought to <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to Ashness and expect you to come with me." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What should I do with you? I don't {{enjoy your}} company. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> here solely {{to get that}} treasure, as you must <b>know.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> after that and leave you where you are." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Yes, but not yet--not so soon. He {{must think}} I'm very gloomy, and I {{want to be}} always bright and cheerful with him. He knows why I wouldn't let him come in; he <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to have a cry." ...|$|E

[...] "She was all dressed {{and ready to}} come before she <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to dress the same way.

6000|$|... "You <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> away to-morrow. <b>I</b> don't want to go. Perhaps that <b>is</b> why <b>I</b> have <b>been</b> such poor company today. I have a presentiment of evil <b>I</b> <b>am</b> afraid <b>I</b> {{may never}} come back." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Why not, indeed?" [...] he reechoed, sardonically. [...] "Then {{the safe}} {{thing for you}} is to kill me on the spot. I would defend myself. But you may just as well <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> about unarmed." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{meant to}} see you before I saw Mr. Austin," [...] he resumed. [...] "I'm going back {{for the men and}} must get a boat at once. If the Commandante <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> he wouldn't let me sail, and he will know soon. Cayman's ready for sea and you must lend me her." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I didn't either," [...] said Mavering, [...] "when I left Boston. Of course I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> {{down there}} to see her, but when I got there it kept going on, just like {{anything}} else, {{up to the last}} moment.

They <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to Wichita Falls to get them, and they probably hung around waiting for my return. And they probably got Martell and Brown to get you boys out of the way. The story about Gabe Werner having a broken leg was probably faked up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But, say, I wish I could 've let her <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> earlier, Miss Zapp. <b>I</b> didn't <b>know</b> it myself, but it {{does seem}} like a mean trick. I s'pose I ought to pay her {{something}} extra." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well;--if {{you must}} <b>know,</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to Goodwood. <b>I</b> {{had not thought}} of it. But some friends have {{reminded}} me that as these are {{to be the last}} days of my liberty I may as well enjoy them." ...|$|R

6000|$|Bathurst {{shook his}} head. [...] "I know myself too well, Doctor, {{to indulge in}} any such hopes. Now you see we are going out tiger hunting.

6000|$|... "You {{came with}} Sid, didn't you?" [...] she whispered. [...] "Sid is so sly--he never tells us {{whom he is}} going to take anywhere. But when I saw you come in with him I <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to like you, you looked so jolly. And you're really the sister of that splendid Dr. Seeley who saved Murray's life last summer? And to think you've been at Payzant nearly a whole term and we never knew it!" ...|$|E
60|$|It {{shows how}} little I knew Jeeves {{in those days}} that I didn't go a bit deeper into the matter with him.

What I mean is, Florence <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> back to Easeby the day after to-morrow, anyway; so why the hurry call? Something must have happened, of course; but I couldn't see what on earth it could be.|$|E
6000|$|Selah turned round {{sharply and}} looked up in {{his face with a}} vague feeling of indefinable wonder. 'What do you mean?' she asked, in a husky voice. 'Don't do what? How do you <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>going</b> to do anything?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You dear people!" [...] she exclaimed, impulsively. [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>going</b> to {{have ever}} such nice things {{to thank you}} for. May <b>I</b> <b>be</b> a child, and put off looking at them until after breakfast? Do you mind, all of you?" ...|$|R
