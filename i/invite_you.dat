25|$|Sir, I {{have the}} honor of informing you that I have arrived in this port with a {{commission}} from the Supreme Government of the United Provinces of the Rio de la Plata to take possession of these islands {{on behalf of the}} country to which they belong by Natural Law. While carrying out this mission I want to do so with all the courtesy and respect all friendly nations; one of the objectives of my mission is to prevent the destruction of resources necessary for all ships passing by and forced to cast anchor here, as well as to help them to obtain the necessary supplies, with minimum expenses and inconvenience. Since your presence here is not in competition with these purposes and in the belief that a personal meeting will be fruitful for both of us, I <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> to come aboard, where you'll be welcomed to stay as long as you wish; I would also greatly appreciate your extending this invitation to any other British subject found in the vicinity; I am, respectfully yours.

500|$|While {{establishing}} {{herself as}} an artist and working her way up through the New York underground club scene, Gaga released her debut studio album, The Fame. Speaking about the title and concept of the album, Gaga explained: [...] "The Fame is about how anyone can feel famous. [...] Pop culture is art. It doesn't make you cool to hate pop culture, so I embraced it and you hear it all over The Fame. But, it's a sharable fame. I want to <b>invite</b> <b>you</b> all to the party. I want people to feel a part of this lifestyle." [...] Gaga stated in an interview with MTV UK that she had been working on the album {{for two and a half}} years and completed half of it during the first week of January 2008. As well as writing the lyrics, Gaga worked on the melodies and synth work of the album, with record producer RedOne. According to Gaga, the first track [...] "Just Dance" [...] is a joyous, heart-themed song, which appeals to people going through tough times in their life. [...] "LoveGame", the second track, was inspired by Gaga's sexual crush on a stranger in a night club to whom she said, [...] "I wanna ride on your disco stick". It was written in four minutes based on the disco stick hook. [...] "Paparazzi" [...] has been interpreted with different meanings. However Gaga explained in an interview with About.com, that the song was inspired by her struggles and hunger for fame and love. Essentially a love song, [...] "Paparazzi" [...] dealt with enticing the media and asked the question, whether one can have both fame and love.|$|E
