5|$|The sixth set of episodes also stayed {{below the}} 4 million mark, {{but in an}} evening that saw ITV beat BBC One's {{audience}} share in the evening by 19.6% to 19%, including the earlier episode of Red of Black? gaining 3.8m viewers, while the later show was viewed by slightly more with 3.9m. However, in direct competition with the later show was BBC One's Would <b>I</b> <b>Lie</b> to You? which had slightly more viewers, with 4m tuning in. On the return of Red or Black? to Saturday night, the show climbed above 4 million {{for the first time}} in three days, to 4.63m for the first show and then up to 5.67m for the second. This enabled ITV to beat BBC One in the primetime ratings overall, by 23.3% to 21%, even though the first episode of series 8 of Strictly Come Dancing was broadcast on BBC. However Red or Black? individually placed behind both Strictly and Doctor Who, with the overnights for the BBC shows being 7.6 and 6.0 million, respectively. Overall through the week the main ITV channel had a higher share of the ratings during primetime than BBC One on five out of the seven occasions, a turnaround from the previous week where it only won on a single evening.|$|E

500|$|Several co-stars found Steiger difficult; Warren Oates, {{according}} to director Norman Jewison, viewed Steiger as [...] "somebody {{who had a}} tendency to go over the top" [...] during the making of In The Heat of the Night. Writer Richard Dyer highlights the contrast in the film between the acting styles of Steiger and Poitier, with [...] "Poitier's stillness and implied intensity" [...] and [...] "Steiger's busy, exteriorised method acting". Humphrey Bogart, Steiger's co-star of The Harder They Fall, referred to Steiger's method acting as the [...] "scratch-your-ass-and-mumble school of acting". Director Robert Aldrich notes that Steiger had a habit of changing his lines, which often confused his co-stars. Aldrich stated: [...] "Usually <b>I</b> <b>lie</b> awake at nights trying to think of ways to improve an actor's performance. With Steiger, the problem is to try and contain him". Steiger was particularly aggressive towards director Kenneth Annakin during the making of Across the Bridge, insisting on rewriting most of the script and changing many of the lines to better fit Steiger's idea of the character. Annakin stated that he had [...] "never known an actor to put so much thought and preparation into a performance" [...] as Steiger. Hutchinson revealed that Steiger often suffered from panic during filming and that fear of failure haunted him throughout his life, but fear also provided him with a source of strength in his acting.|$|E
500|$|Mckinsey's Managing Partner, Dominic Barton {{issued a}} statement, {{following}} an internal investigation, {{in which the}} firm [...] "admitted that it found violations of its professional standards but denied any acts of bribery, corruption, and payments to Trillian." [...] This statement was rejected {{by a number of}} civil society organisations and opinion makers.. [...] Eusebius McKaiser, a radio talk show host and former Mckinsey employee said, of Bartons' statement in an article headlined [...] "Why Mckinsey is not Innocent", that [...] "I sometimes wonder whether corporations think we are a bunch of fools incapable of seeing excrement for what it is." [...] The Daily Maverick published an article entitled [...] "Curious and Curiouser: McKinsey’s astonishing attempt at self-exoneration" [...] in which journalist Pauli van Wyk wrote that [...] "McKinsey’s “investigation” found nothing more to say about its dealings with Eskom and the Gupta-linked company Trillian than what the firm has already admitted to.". [...] The Financial Mail, a weekly financial magazine, published an editorial strap-lined [...] "McKinsey's tone deaf fudge" [...] entitled [...] "McKinsey: Would <b>I</b> <b>lie</b> to you?" [...] describing the list of excuses provided by Barton in his statement as improbable and that the statement did not go nearly far enough to explain how Mckinsey and Trillian earned R1.6bn in 6 months without a lawful contract. [...] The article went on to describe Mckinsey's behaviour as being, if not corruption, then certainly greed and profiteering.|$|E
