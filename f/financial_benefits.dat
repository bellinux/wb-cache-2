5|$|In Capital E Analysis' {{conclusions}} of the <b>financial</b> <b>benefits</b> of green buildings, {{it was determined that}} green roofs successfully lowered energy usage and raised health benefits. For every square foot of green roof used in one study the savings amounted to $5.80 energy-wise. There were also savings seen in the emissions, water, and maintenance categories. Overall, the savings amounted to $52.90-$71.30 on average while the cost of going green totaled -$3.00-$5.00.|$|E
5|$|Sefton Council {{gave their}} final {{approval}} in September 2013, with construction starting {{towards the end}} of the 2013 calendar year. The cost was in the region of £20.4 million, with the UK Government contributing £14.5M towards that and Sefton Council contributing £5.9M. The <b>financial</b> <b>benefits</b> over the 60 years following construction of the road has been estimated to be in the region of £140–200M.|$|E
5|$|Smith-Hall, Larsen and Pouliotof {{argue that}} {{medicinal}} plants provide three main kinds of benefit: health {{benefits to the}} people who consume them as medicines; <b>financial</b> <b>benefits</b> to people who harvest, process, and distribute them for sale; and society-wide benefits such as job opportunities, taxation income, and a healthier labour force.|$|E
5000|$|An OSP must [...] "not {{receive a}} <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> {{directly}} {{attributable to the}} infringing activity" [...] to qualify for § 512(c) protection. However, {{it is not always}} easy to determine what qualifies as a direct <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> under the statute.|$|R
30|$|Due to {{the lower}} price and higher {{consumption}} of end products, the <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> to consumers {{was found to be}} higher with the utilisation of planted forests than without them, in all regions examined. However, globally, the <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> to producers was lower because the increase in planted-forest producer benefit did not compensate fully for the decrease in natural-forest producer benefit. Planted forests therefore induced a transfer of <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> from natural-forest wood producers to consumers of end products and planted-forest producers. Nevertheless, the total benefit (producer + consumer benefits) increased in most regions and at global level. Estimates suggest that the average net present value of future <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> from planted forests throughout the world would be approximately US$ 10, 000 hectare.|$|R

5|$|The Environment Agency's {{long-term}} {{policy is}} {{to hold the line}} only to protect communities and infrastructure, with managed retreat as the solution to rising sea levels elsewhere, even at sites like Cley where the <b>financial</b> <b>benefits</b> from the recreational value of the reserve outweigh the cost of maintaining the sea defences. A scheme to allow tidal flooding of part of the reserve has already been implemented at Titchwell Marsh.|$|E
5|$|After denying rumors for decades, in 2004 McElhenny {{confirmed}} {{that he received}} improper <b>financial</b> <b>benefits</b> from the University of Washington during his time there, which included a $300 monthly check. Per NCAA rules, the most a college can offer an athlete is a summer job and a scholarship covering boarding and tuition. A popular (albeit usually jocular) spin on the rumor was that McElhenny essentially took a pay cut {{when he left the}} university to play for the 49ers. This was not entirely untrue; all payments accounted for, including legitimate ones, McElhenny claimed he and his wife received a combined $10,000 a year while at Washington—with the 49ers, his rookie salary was worth $7,000.|$|E
5|$|The IUCN has {{recommended}} co-operation between countries across the cheetah's range to minimise {{the conflict between}} cheetahs and human beings. A 2016 study showed that ecotourism can have a significantly {{positive impact on the}} conservation of the cheetah. Although the requirement of space for the habitat would have to be compromised in most cases, establishment of private reserves for cheetahs and ensuring the absence of predators and poachers could be a successful conservation measure. Additionally, the <b>financial</b> <b>benefits</b> accrued and the awareness generated can further aid the cause of the cheetah. At the same time, the animals should not be unnecessarily handled or disturbed, as cheetahs are particularly sensitive to human interference.|$|E

5000|$|One {{example of}} an OSP that did receive a direct <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> from {{infringing}} activity was Napster. In A&M Records, Inc. v. Napster, Inc., {{the court held that}} copyrighted material on Napster's system created a [...] "draw" [...] for customers which resulted in a direct <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> because Napster's future revenue was directly dependent on increases in user-base. Conversely, in Ellison v. Robertson, the court held that AOL did not receive a direct <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> when a user stored infringing material on its server because the copyrighted work did not [...] "draw" [...] new customers. AOL neither [...] "attracted nor retained…nor lost…subscriptions" [...] {{as a result of the}} infringing material.|$|R
5|$|The {{underlying}} {{problem was not}} solved: Joseph's foreign policy dictated the expansion of Habsburg influence over German-speaking territories, and only this, he believed, would counter Prussia's growing strength in Imperial affairs. In 1785, Joseph again sought to make a territorial deal with Charles Theodore, again offering to trade portions of Bavarian territory for portions of the Austrian Netherlands. This time {{it would be a}} straight trade: territory for territory, not a partition. Although the Austrian Netherlands was a wealthy territory, it was a thorn in Joseph's side, opposing his administrative and bureaucratic reforms and devouring military and administrative resources he desperately needed elsewhere in his realm. Despite its problems, Joseph could not afford to give up the Netherlands entirely, so his efforts to negotiate a partial territorial exchange guaranteed him some of the <b>financial</b> <b>benefits</b> of both his Netherlands possessions and the Bavarian territories.|$|E

Since RTC failed to prove that Netcom received direct <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> from the infringing activity, RTC's claim of vicarious liability failed.|$|R

40|$|The {{strategic}} {{timing and}} adverse events hypotheses of personal bankruptcy have received particular attention. Existing {{research focuses on}} proving or disproving either hypothesis, using a strict interpretation {{of the role of}} <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> in the filing decision. Using a more realistic framework in which <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> may affect the filing decision in both hypotheses, we show that endogeneity of <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> is a distinguishing factor between the two hypotheses. Using two different datasets, we show that the endogeneity test favors the adverse events hypothesis. Extending the analysis to allow for both types, we find evidence of heterogeneity in filing types, consistent with both hypotheses. On average, approximately 16 percent of households are more likely to behave as strategic types and 84 percent as adverse events types. Several implications of these results are explored. Consumer bankruptcy, personal bankruptcy, adverse events, strategic timing...|$|R

25|$|Lastly, {{it should}} not be assumed that conserving {{ecosystems}} is always financially beneficial as opposed to alteration.

40|$|A test {{of adverse}} events and {{strategic}} timing theories can {{be conducted by}} determining whether some relevant financial decision variables, such as <b>financial</b> <b>benefit</b> from filing for bankruptcy, or debt discharged in bankruptcy are endogenous with the bankruptcy decision or not. For the strategic timing theory such decisions are endogenous, while for the adverse events theory they are not. Hausman tests for endogeneity show that <b>financial</b> <b>benefit,</b> unsecured debt, and non-exempt assets are exogenous with the bankruptcy decision, consistent with the adverse events theory. ...|$|R
