25|$|Gay actor Martin Kurath (Prochnow) who is {{in prison}} {{develops}} a friendship with Thomas Manzoni (Hannawald), the 15-year-old son of the prison warden (Lüönd). The two {{fall in love and}} they both yearn for Kurath's release. This triggers intense indignation in their surroundings. After Kurath is released a year later, Thomas accompanied by Kurath, tells his parents he is a homosexual. His father tells him to leave and never return. Kurath and Thomas move in together and Thomas enrolls in school. Thomas' father, however, then has him arrested and condemned to a brutal reformatory. Kurath obtains a fake passport and poses as a psychology doctoral candidate and helps Thomas escape with him to Germany. They are betrayed by a German homosexual friend of Kurath's who insists, in Kurath's absence, that Thomas become his lover in order to obtain a German residency permit. Thomas does so, but then refuses to sleep with the betrayer, is kicked out and prostitutes himself. Broken by these experiences, he voluntarily returns to the reformatory. When he reaches 21 and is released, he is so psychologically damaged that, despite reunion with Kurath, he attempts suicide and is committed to a psychiatric hospital. He escapes and the film ends with a TV announcement that the police are looking for him and that the public should, if approaching him, treat him <b>gently,</b> <b>as</b> he is very depressed and confused.|$|E
500|$|Adams {{performed}} about 80 shots per exhibition. He {{had a large}} {{repertoire of}} practiced shots—more than 500—affording him the luxury to not having to repeat a single shot during a week-long exhibition. The abundance of shots was unusual, and was described by one sports writer as [...] "more extensive than the entire billiard fraternity put together". The following description of Adams' shots appeared in an 1891 newspaper article, which highlighted them as, [...] "among his difficult feats":Two quart wine bottles are placed at {{the short end of}} the table, three feet apart; a ball is placed on the top of each bottle, and a third ball, six feet from the bottles in the opposite corner. Adams makes the hand ball jump from bottle to bottle then to take an English in space, counting on the third bail, a double shot.Fifteen balls are placed in a line, three inches apart. On the last ball is placed a piece of chalk, while two feet from the other end, at a square angle, is placed a single ball. Yank drops the hand ball with a Massé twist, which, after hitting the single ball, describes a semi-circle, taken the cushion first, then makes a carrom on the fifteen balls, but is played with such a delicate calculation as barely to reach the last ball; in fact, freezes against it so <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> not to dislodge the chalk previously placed thereon.A derby hat is placed on the table, under which is a ball. One foot from the hat are two balls a foot apart, which he carroms on, the hand ball continues striking the rim of the hat, forces it up, and goes under making the stroke on the third ball, then returns from under the hat when it rocks the second time.He also stand {{at the head of the}} table, throwing the balls with a hundred-yard force but has them stop eight feet away in such a position as to spell his name.|$|E

2500|$|Phalen's {{maneuver}} {{is performed}} by flexing the wrist <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> far as possible, then holding this position and awaiting symptoms. A positive test {{is one that}} results in numbness in the median nerve distribution when holding the wrist in acute flexion position within 60 seconds. The quicker the numbness starts, the more advanced the condition. Phalen's sign is defined as pain and/or paresthesias in the median-innervated fingers with one minute of wrist flexion. Only this test {{has been shown to}} correlate with CTS severity when studied prospectively. The test characteristics of Phalen's maneuver have varied across studies ranging from 42–85% sensitivity and 54–98% specificity.|$|E
2500|$|Jackman {{also wrote}} motifs {{for the major}} {{characters}} introduced in the film: Spider-Man, Black Panther, and Zemo. Spider-Man's motif has a small arc to match that character's few appearances, being introduced very <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> the [...] "somewhat confused, slightly tender" [...] Peter Parker first appears, followed by [...] "the seed of his heroism" [...] when he is recruited for the Avengers, and finally a [...] "full-blown version" [...] plays when he fights alongside the other heroes. For Black Panther, Jackman used a combination of African woodwind instruments whenever the character talks about his ancestors, while muted trombones [...] "brought his character into {{the grandeur of the}} symphony orchestra, but there’s a slightly vengeful, serrated sound to muted trombones if you pick the right kind of mood". Zemo's personal theme was performed on [...] "a lot of these rather unusual tuned bells" [...] that gave him an [...] "otherly sound", as well as a cimbalon to represent his Eastern European roots.|$|E
2500|$|One of the {{short-term}} aging needs of wine {{is a period}} where the wine is considered [...] "sick" [...] due to the trauma and volatility of the bottling experience. During bottling the wine is exposed to some oxygen which causes a domino effect of chemical reactions with various components of the wine. The {{time it takes for}} the wine to settle down and have the oxygen fully dissolve and integrate with the wine is considered its period of [...] "bottle shock". During this time the wine could taste drastically different from how it did prior to bottling or how it will taste after the wine has settled. While many modern bottling lines try to treat the wine as <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> possible and utilize inert gases to minimize the amount of oxygen exposure, all wine goes through some period of bottle shock. The length of this period will vary with each individual wine.|$|E

2500|$|It was {{revealed}} in July 2008 that Matsumoto was dating then 25-year-old tarento Ihara Rin. In {{the evening of}} May 17, 2009, {{it was announced that}} Matsumoto's official bachelorhood had ended with a secret marriage ceremony between himself and the aforementioned Ihara. Ihara, a former weather announcer for the Japanese news program [...] "ズームイン!! Super" [...] (Zoom In!! Super) is nineteen years Matsumoto's junior, and apparently became pregnant by Matsumoto, prompting the marriage. The announcement of the marriage came via fax by Matsumoto's managing organization to several media outlets, including a personal message by Matsumoto himself: [...] "My partner will become an average citizen [...] and is currently pregnant. As this is a delicate time, I would like this to be dealt with as <b>gently</b> <b>as</b> possible. It would be best to hold a press conference, however this situation is awkward and I will refrain from doing so." [...] The original faxed announcement did not contain details on Matsumoto's wife; however it has become widely known that his new partner is Ihara.|$|E
