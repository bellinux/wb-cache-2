40|$|The <b>National</b> <b>Programme</b> for Information Technology is {{the largest}} civil IT {{programme}} worldwide at an estimated cost of £ 6. 2 bn over a ten-year period. Launched in 2002, it {{provides an opportunity for}} the IT service industry to develop business models in the UK healthcare sector in which, historically, has seen low investment in IT services. Nearly four years on—and under pressure from government and senior hospital managers to deliver working systems—the relationship between public sector organisations and private sector firms is once again under increasing scrutiny. All the IT systems are late and over-budget with vendors either leaving the programme or re-negotiating their contracts with Connecting for Health, the government agency which runs the <b>National</b> <b>Programme</b> for Information (<b>National</b> <b>Programme).</b> In this study, we investigate the role of IT vendors in fulfilling the aims and objectives of the <b>National</b> <b>Programme</b> in the context of market, business, managerial, and technical factors. Despite highly publicised large-scale IT outsourcing contracts, many IT vendors are unable to fulfil the rigid terms and conditions of their contracts. Our findings suggest the reasons are complex, but shortcomings in vendor capabilities, contractual terms and conditions, financial pressures and poor governance arrangements have led to slow progress and even resistance to the <b>National</b> <b>Programme...</b>|$|R

40|$|The European Directive {{establishing}} “Safe and Responsible Management of Spent Fuel and Radioactive Waste” (Council Directive 2011 / 70 /EURATOM), {{entered into}} force 22 August 2011. The Directive was negotiated between the EU Member States and, as required under the EURATOM Treaty, adopted by unanimous {{vote in the}} Council. The Member States commit to adopting National Policies {{in agreement with the}} best international standards, ensure that a National Framework is available, and establish and implement <b>National</b> <b>Programmes</b> turning the policies into action. Two years after entering into force, the EU Member States need to transpose the Directive into national law. Four years after entering into force, the Member States need to notify to the European Commission their respective <b>National</b> <b>Programmes.</b> The Commission will then assess the <b>National</b> <b>Programmes</b> and ensure that they meet the obligations of the Directive, or require Member State to make improvements. For this purpose, it is favourable to have an open and transparent benchmark concerning expectations on <b>National</b> <b>Programmes.</b> This is true both for the Member States when establishing, implementing and notifying their respec¬tive <b>National</b> <b>Programmes,</b> and for the assessment by the Commission. The European Nuclear Energy Forum (ENEF) was entrusted with the task of generating a corresponding Guide. The Guide is developed over a period of two years, starting directly after the Directive enter¬ing into force. Member States are represented by their ENEF drafting group members, but are also contributing to establishing the Guide by Workshops and invitations to comment. By this approach, the Member States are directly involved in establishing the Guide, and have access to the final Guide two years ahead of deadline for notification of their <b>National</b> <b>Programmes</b> to the Commission. The Guide describes the need to directly link the Policy, the Framework and the <b>National</b> <b>Programme,</b> with a set of quality indicators for assessing the Programmes. It also discusses the waste inventory, including estimates of future arisings, as the basis for defining the actual problem to be tackled. The inventory is also an instrument for ensuring that disposal solutions are allocated to all waste remaining after clearance, processing and treatment. The Guide deals with classical project management as the basis for handling the different waste streams towards their respective disposal end-points. The bulk of the Guide treats the provisions in Article 12. 1 where the elements of <b>National</b> <b>Programmes</b> are given. The Guide finally pro¬vides a proposal for a possible structure of a lead document for documenting, disseminating and communicating the <b>National</b> <b>Programme</b> to different stakeholders, but also for notifying the <b>National</b> <b>Programme</b> to the Commission. The paper describes the Guide and the reasoning behind its structure and content. The Guide may be updated as necessary, including through experience feedback in applying it during the two years left until notification after its publication. JRC. E. 5 -Nuclear chemistr...|$|R
