500|$|Critical {{reception}} of {{the leader of the}} Flood were mixed. In a review of Halo 2, Mike Leonard of the AllXbox community said that the introduction of the Gravemind character had him [...] "rolling my eyes hard enough to get motion sickness from seeing the back of the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> skull"; Leonard {{went on to say that}} the [...] "Little Shop of Horrors reject" [...] ruined the [...] "cool" [...] of the Halo franchise. Staff from GamesRadar singled out the appearance of the Gravemind as a sign the Halo series had jumped the shark. [...] "Until Gravemind showed up, we were pretty sure we understood the Halo series' story," [...] they wrote, but that the appearance of a Venus Flytrap-like creature with an ego and [...] "a tendency to spout philosophical drivel" [...] was unexpected. Jeremy Parish of 1UP.com bemoaned the fact that Gravemind was never explicitly stated to be the Flood leader in either Halo 2 or Halo 3 and was hardly seen in the third installment. Publications also took issue with the fact that the character's motivations were never fully explored; the South Florida Sun-Sentinel said that the [...] "unique and compelling characters" [...] of Halo 3, such as Cortana and the Master Chief, were overwhelmed by Gravemind.|$|E
2500|$|The Maze {{was painted}} in gouache colors. Kurelek {{describes}} it as [...] "a painting of the <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> <b>my</b> skull." [...] That skull has been split open vertically to reveal various compartments inside. Through the eyes, nose, and mouth {{we can see the}} rest of the body lying in a wheat field. Inside the skull itself, each compartment holds a scrap of paper, representing a memory or thought. The center compartment, however, holds only a white rat, which represents Kurelek's spirit. The rat is wound up and inert, having run through the maze of the skull chewing a piece of each scrap of paper and finding it undigestible.|$|E

40|$|In my diploma thesis, {{the physics}} of sound {{formation}} in woodwind instruments {{and the types of}} woodwind instrument are discussed. The main parts of the clarinet and its functions are described from the physical point of view. Furthermore, using a clarinet, a microphone and a computer program Scope, the formation of sound in the clarinet, has been analyzed. I have checked that the odd higher harmonics are strengthened. I have as well analyzed the relations between the higher harmonics. Using a semi open tube from plastics material I examined the acoustic pressure inside the tube especially near the open holes. My findings from the experiment with the plastic tube were then applied to the clarinet and I was able to determine the position of the first pressure antinode <b>inside</b> <b>of</b> it. <b>My</b> measurement has proven that a semi open cylindrical tube is indeed an appropriate physical model of the clarinet...|$|R
