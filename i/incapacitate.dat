5000|$|There is one {{documented}} case of <b>incapacitating</b> agents {{being used}} in recent years. In 2002, Chechen terrorists took {{a large number of}} hostages in the Moscow theatre siege, and threatened to blow up the entire theatre if any attempt was made to break the siege. An <b>incapacitating</b> agent was used to disable the terrorists whilst the theatre was stormed by special forces. However, the <b>incapacitating</b> agent, unknown at that time, caused many of the hostages to die. The terrorists were rendered unconscious, but roughly 15% of the 800 people exposed were killed by the gas. The situation was not helped {{by the fact that the}} authorities kept the nature of the <b>incapacitating</b> agent secret from doctors trying to treat its victims. At the time, the gas was reported to be an unknown <b>incapacitating</b> agent called [...] "Kolokol-1". The Russian Health Minister Yuri Shevchenko later stated that the <b>incapacitating</b> agent used was a fentanyl derivative.|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "date rape" [...] is used {{to refer}} to several types of rape, broadly {{acquaintance}} rape, which is a non-domestic rape committed by someone who knows the victim, and drug facilitated sexual assault (DFSA), where the rapist intentionally drugs the victim with a date rape drug so that they are <b>incapacitated.</b> Acquaintance rape constitutes the vast majority of reported rapes, while DFSA is infrequent. A frequently overlapping category is <b>incapacitated</b> rape, where the victim is <b>incapacitated</b> and unable to give consent - this is often the result of intoxication, but can also simply be because the victim is asleep or has a medical condition. DFSA is when the rapist intentionally <b>incapacitates</b> the victim via drugs, while acquaintance rape can occur when the victim is not <b>incapacitated.</b>|$|R
5|$|Having {{previously}} gained {{political control}} of Antelope, Oregon, Rajneesh's followers, who were based in nearby Rajneeshpuram, sought election {{to two of}} the three seats on the Wasco County Circuit Court that were up for election in November 1984. Fearing they would not gain enough votes, Rajneeshpuram officials decided to <b>incapacitate</b> voters in The Dalles, the largest population center in Wasco County. The chosen biological agent was Salmonella enterica Typhimurium, which was first delivered through glasses of water to two County Commissioners and then, on a larger scale, at salad bars and in salad dressing.|$|E

5|$|Drummond's wartime {{experience}} {{had given him}} a series of abilities akin to that of a hunter: stealth—"he could move over ground without a single blade of grass rustling"—and the ability to <b>incapacitate</b> others—"he could kill a man with his bare hands in a second". During his time on the Western Front he would take himself on solitary raids through no man's land. Drummond was also proficient in jujutsu and boxing, was a crack shot, played cricket for the Free Foresters, and was an excellent poker player. In addition to Drummond's physical attributes is his common sense, which allows him to equal and beat his opponents, even if they have a superior intellect.|$|E

5|$|In general, RNA viruses have smaller genome sizes than DNA viruses {{because of}} a higher error-rate when replicating, and have a maximum upper size limit. Beyond this limit, errors in the genome when replicating render the virus useless or uncompetitive. To {{compensate}} for this, RNA viruses often have segmented genomes– the genome is split into smaller molecules– thus reducing the chance that an error in a single-component genome will <b>incapacitate</b> the entire genome. In contrast, DNA viruses generally have larger genomes {{because of the high}} fidelity of their replication enzymes. Single-strand DNA viruses are an exception to this rule, however, as mutation rates for these genomes can approach the extreme of the ssRNA virus case.|$|E

After killing many villagers, he proceeds to the Nibelheim reactor where Jenova has been encased. Tifa, a resident of Nibelheim, attacks him soon after he arrives. Sephiroth knocks her aside and continues to Jenova's body, preserved in a large glass tank filled with liquid. Zack follows Sephiroth into the reactor and they engage in combat, but Sephiroth is able to disarm and <b>incapacitate</b> him.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2012 Numerous {{studies have}} {{examined}} the role that alcohol use can play in leading to not only sexual behavior but also to potential risky decision making in such situations (Cooper, 2002). This study sought to extend existing research by examining the role that typical drinking, drinking in sexual contexts, and sex-related alcohol expectancies can play in <b>incapacitated</b> sex among a community sample of 309 women. These women both identified as social drinkers and screened in with at least one binge-drinking episode in the past month. It was hypothesized that drinking in sexual situations would mediate the relationship between typical drinking and <b>incapacitated</b> sex. It was further hypothesized that drinking in sexual situations would mediate the relationship between sex-related alcohol expectancies and <b>incapacitated</b> sex. Results confirmed that drinking in sexual situations was a mediator for both typical drinking and sex-related alcohol expectancies in terms of <b>incapacitated</b> sex. These results hold implications for intervention programming related to expectancies and drinking as well emphasize the need for future research into further risk factors related to <b>incapacitated</b> sex...|$|R
40|$|For land-use planning, French acute {{toxicity}} thresholds are developed {{based on a}} methodology. This method proposes an exhaustive review of acute toxicological data {{and is based on}} expert judgment. Currently, the <b>incapacitating</b> effects are not taken into account in this methodology when setting thresholds. Generally, <b>incapacitating</b> effects are reversible effects but they could prevent the escape or affect the performance of a task. These effects can lead to prolonged exposure to the toxic substance and thus may cause irreversible or even lethal effect. Most of the international agencies (U. S. EPA, AIHA, [...] .) take into account the <b>incapacitating</b> effects in determining {{acute toxicity}} thresholds for emergency. <b>Incapacitating</b> effects can be classified according to their nature (physical, chemical), specificity (local, systemic) and severity. Several options were discussed for the inclusion of this type of effects in the French methodology. First, the definition of the threshold of irreversible effects could be revised to include incapacity. Or a specific paragraph could alert about the possible occurrence of <b>incapacitating</b> effects. Finally, a specific threshold could be developed, intermediate between reversible and irreversible thresholds. Different chemicals were used as case studies to test the different hypotheses. The substances of concern were chlorine, hydrogen fluoride and tetrachloroethylene. As example for tetrachloroethylene, <b>incapacitating</b> effect thresholds has been developed and shown that the third hypothesis seems the most acceptable. Indeed, a threshold of <b>incapacitating</b> effect for tetrachloroethylene is proposed at 250 ppm regardless of the exposure time, based on dizziness and incoordination. This threshold is currently under review...|$|R

5|$|Players {{can play}} a more {{aggressive}} run-and-gun game by using gadgets and weapons to eliminate enemies. They can interact with environmental objects, such as ledges and zip-lines, to navigate levels. Conviction mark-and-execute system returns in Blacklist, with refinements and additions to allow players to mark several targets. When they attack, they can kill all marked targets instantly. Improvements made the system work more fluidly. A variety of enemies (including soldiers and dogs) are encountered in the game, following the protagonist and alerting their companions. Players {{have the option to}} kill them, leave them untouched, or <b>incapacitate</b> them, and the game classifies their choices in one of three categories: Ghost (stealthy play), Panther (stealthy, aggressive play), and Assault (aggressive play).|$|E
5|$|Solitary and nocturnal, the Pacific {{electric}} ray can generate up to 45 volts of electricity {{for the purposes}} of subduing prey or self-defense. It feeds mainly on bony fishes, ambushing them from the substrate during the day and actively hunting for them at night. Reproduction is aplacental viviparous, meaning that the embryos are initially nourished by yolk, later supplemented by histotroph ("uterine milk") produced by the mother. Females bear litters of 17–20 pups, probably once every other year. Care should be exercised around the Pacific {{electric ray}}, as it has been known to act aggressively if provoked and its electric shock can potentially <b>incapacitate</b> a diver. It and other electric rays are used as model organisms for biomedical research. The International Union for Conservation of Nature (IUCN) has listed this species under Least Concern, as it is not fished in any significant numbers.|$|E

This species {{is now one of the}} most common birds of prey in Europe, although the population crashed after the Second World War. Organochlorine insecticides used to treat seeds before sowing built up in the bird population, and the concentrations in Eurasian sparrowhawks were enough to kill some outright and <b>incapacitate</b> others; affected birds laid eggs with fragile shells which broke during incubation. However, its population recovered after the chemicals were banned, and it is now relatively common, classified as being of Least Concern by BirdLife International.|$|E
5|$|Videoball plays as a {{two-dimensional}} hybrid of air hockey and soccer {{on a single}} screen. Players form two teams of one to three players.

The projectile can propel the ball, block other projectiles, and <b>incapacitate</b> opponents. Since the shot is triangle-shaped, it can only drive the ball for some distance before the ball veers off-course.|$|E
5|$|The Macedonian {{fleet of}} around 200 ships, manned by 30,000 men, {{significantly}} outnumbered the coalition's fleet of sixty-five large warships, nine medium vessels and three triremes.
