5|$|Hospices: While late {{referral}} to <b>hospice</b> {{is a much}} more prevalent problem than early referral, some <b>hospice</b> providers will hesitate to admit patients to <b>hospice</b> (or they may de-certify them from <b>hospice</b> too early) due to scrutiny from Medicare for patients deemed to be on <b>hospice</b> too long. After a patient has been on <b>hospice</b> for six months, Medicare is more aggressive in auditing the <b>hospice</b> for inappropriate payment of services. For some hospices this is simply not worth the trouble, and patients are screened very carefully prior to admission.|$|E
5|$|If it is {{determined}} {{at the time}} of review that a patient's prognosis may be greater than six months, the patient is de-certified (discharged) from <b>hospice.</b> The <b>hospice</b> is required by law to give advance notification to the patient, and the patient can appeal the hospice's decision to Medicare. Usually the <b>hospice</b> plans these discharges weeks in advance to make the transition off <b>hospice,</b> which can be traumatic for patients who have been preparing to die, as smooth as possible. Should the patient's condition worsen once discharged from <b>hospice</b> they can be readmitted to <b>hospice.</b>|$|E

A survey by postal questionnaire was carried out on the perceptions of senior chaplains in 151 <b>hospices</b> and 194 hospital trusts. The overall response rate was 76 %. The findings of the survey suggest (a) a trend away from establishing chapels as the spiritual focal point within hospitals and <b>hospices,</b> (b) the development of broader roles for chaplains, (c) a different level of service provision between <b>hospices</b> with funded chaplaincies and <b>hospices</b> with voluntary chaplaincies, (d) a wide range of non-religious spiritual care requirements on the part of patients and (e) a more frequent requirement for religious care in hospitals rather than <b>hospices...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{considers}} {{some issues}} {{in the provision of}} adult bereavement support in UK <b>hospices.</b> The paper is based on the findings of a multi-method study conducted in two phases over 30 months (2003 - 2005) to examine the nature and quality of adult bereavement support in UK <b>hospices</b> from the perspectives of bereaved people and professional and volunteer bereavement workers [Field, Reid, Payne, & Relf (2005). Adult Bereavement Support in Five <b>Hospices</b> in England. Sheffield, UK: Palliative and End-of-Life Care Research Group, University of Sheffield. (Available from Professor Payne) ]. It discusses the importance of continuity between pre-bereavement and bereavement support, the integration of bereavement services within <b>hospices</b> and the involvement of volunteers in bereavement support. It then discusses the engagement of UK <b>hospices</b> in the broader development of bereavement support. Although <b>hospices</b> have developed expertise in supporting bereaved people, our research suggests that they have not had a major impact on other health service providers, such as general practitioners and distinct nurses and staff in acute hospital trusts, in this area.

5|$|A {{patient may}} be {{discharged}} by revocation {{if he or}} she chooses to relinquish the <b>hospice</b> benefit. Revocation could be due to hospitalization, if the patient chooses to pursue some type of curative treatment or experiences dissatisfaction with <b>hospice</b> care. However, not all hospitalizations of patients require revocation; should the admitting diagnosis to the hospital be unrelated to the condition for which they are in <b>hospice,</b> the patient may remain on <b>hospice</b> while undergoing treatment for it.|$|E
5|$|As indicated, <b>hospice</b> is {{frequently}} under-utilized and often not {{taken advantage of}} until very late in a patient's illness.

5|$|Care may be {{provided}} in a patient's {{home or in}} a designated facility, such as a nursing home, hospital unit or freestanding <b>hospice,</b> with level of care and sometimes location based upon frequent evaluation of the patient's needs. The four primary levels of care provided by <b>hospice</b> are routine home care, continuous care, general inpatient, and respite care. Patients undergoing <b>hospice</b> treatment may be discharged {{for a number of}} reasons, including improvement of their condition and refusal to cooperate with providers, but may return to <b>hospice</b> care as their circumstances change. Providers are required by Medicare to provide to patients notice of pending discharge, which they may appeal.|$|E
5|$|Home Health Aide: The home health, or <b>hospice,</b> aide {{is not a}} {{core service}} for a <b>hospice</b> patient; this means it is not {{required}} that every patient on <b>hospice</b> receive an aide. However, most patients do receive this service, and it is often the one most depended on by the patient and family. The <b>hospice</b> aide typically visits anywhere from 3–7 {{days a week for}} approximately 1–2 hours at each visit. His or her functions include providing respite to the primary caregiver and physical support to the patient, including bathing, dressing, or feeding. Many times it is the <b>hospice</b> aide who develops the closest relationship with the patient, due to the frequency of visits. The <b>hospice</b> aide is not a licensed nurse and therefore can not administer medications, treat wounds, handle IV's or similar treatments.|$|E

5|$|<b>Hospice</b> Medical Director: The <b>hospice</b> medical director, a physician, often {{provides}} the most support to the clinical staff providing care to the patient and family. The medical director may also provide medical care if the primary physician is unavailable or if the patient {{does not have a}} primary care provider. The <b>hospice</b> medical director is also required under Medicare to recertify patients.|$|E
5|$|<b>Hospice</b> is a {{competitive}} business. In any given service area, {{there may be}} hundreds of different non-profit and commercial providers. Hospices can be small community-based operations, part of regional and national corporations, or part of a hospital or other health system. Data from the National <b>Hospice</b> and Palliative Care Organization indicated that in 2008 58.3% of <b>hospice</b> agencies were independent, with 20.8% based in hospitals, 19.7% geared for home health care and 1.3% in conjunction with nursing homes. In 2007, {{the mean number of}} patients being treated in <b>hospice</b> facilities on any given day was 90.2. 79.4% of <b>hospice</b> providers admitted fewer than 500 patients per year. The number of for-profit and non-profit providers has become more balanced as the for-profit sector has grown. In 2007, 47.1% of agencies were for-profit, with 48.6% non-profit. The remaining 4.3% were government-owned providers.|$|E
5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for <b>hospice</b> care, a patient must have {{certification}} from two physicians {{that he or she}} has less than six months to live if his or her disease runs its natural course; usually the patient's primary physician and the <b>Hospice</b> Medical Director will provide this certification. Patients can and do stay on <b>hospice</b> longer than six months, {{and as long as the}} <b>hospice</b> team continues to certify with supporting evidence that the patient is terminal, insurance companies will usually continue to pay for <b>hospice</b> care.|$|E

5|$|In {{order to}} qualify for <b>hospice,</b> a patient has to be {{certified}} as having a prognosis of {{less than six months}} to live. Sometimes patients live longer. Medicare patients who receive the <b>hospice</b> benefit must waive other Medicare benefits that could prolong life. Under the Medicare provisions, the <b>hospice</b> benefit through the first six months is broken up into two 90-day benefit periods. At the end of these two benefit periods, the <b>hospice</b> team will evaluate whether or not the patient continues to have a prognosis of less than six months to live. Following these two 90-day benefit periods, the <b>hospice</b> is required to evaluate more closely and review the case every 60 days. Commercial insurers, managed care program providers, and Medicaid often have their own regulations regarding re-certification. When the <b>hospice</b> re-certifies a six-month or less prognosis, this is based on the patient's current condition.|$|E
5|$|Occasionally a <b>hospice</b> will {{be unable}} to provide care to a patient, either due to {{philosophical}} differences with the patient or due to a safety issue. Such causes could include disruptive or abusive behavior from the patient or other persons in the patient's home or refusal to cooperate with the <b>hospice</b> program. Patients may, after being discharged from <b>hospice</b> for any reason, re-enroll in <b>hospice</b> at a later date as necessary.|$|E
5|$|Once {{a patient}} is {{enrolled}} in <b>hospice,</b> the <b>hospice</b> becomes the insurance payor for that patient for any hospice-related illnesses. In other words, if {{a patient is}} on <b>hospice</b> for end-stage congestive heart failure, the <b>hospice</b> is responsible for all care related to the heart failure. However, if the patient were to see a podiatrist, this would be billed through their regular insurance.|$|E

5|$|Physicians: Medical care is {{traditionally}} focused on curing and healing the patient. For many, <b>hospice</b> {{care is not}} seen as the true practice of medicine. Physicians face a persistent social stigma in that <b>hospice</b> is mistaken as giving up on a patient, rather than committing to palliation. Additionally, and although this perception has been changing, when thinking of <b>hospice</b> the doctor is often focused on patients with cancer and not {{many of the other}} terminal diseases which qualify for <b>hospice</b> care.|$|E
5|$|Physicians: There are {{multiple}} aspects as to why, financially, <b>hospice</b> care {{may be difficult}} to access. The first would relate to physician reluctance. As stated previously, when enrolled in <b>hospice,</b> the patient transitions from their primary insurance to having most of their care managed directly by the <b>hospice.</b> As hospices typically have a limited budget, expensive care may not be permitted by the <b>hospice.</b> Additionally, reimbursement for physician visits can be complicated and result in non-payment to physicians. Therefore, difficulty in authorizing expensive treatments and lack of payment for visits can be reasons for non-referral from a physician.|$|E
5|$|Should {{a patient}} be {{transferred}} to an assisted living facility, nursing home, or hospital, the <b>hospice</b> would continue to provide care to the patient which is on par with the services provided under the routine home care benefit. In this way, {{the only difference between}} respite and routine care is that the <b>hospice</b> pays the room and board charges of the facility. Should a patient receive respite in an inpatient <b>hospice</b> unit the care would be similar to what other patients of the <b>hospice</b> unit receive. Respite is provided for a maximum of five days every benefit period.|$|E
