5000|$|Many lathes {{that run}} collet chucks have {{dedicated}} collet-closer setups whereby {{there is no}} backplate, and the spindle nose contains the <b>female</b> <b>taper</b> for either the collet's male outer taper, or a sleeve that will hold it. A hollow drawbar passes back through the headstock to its back side, where a closer mechanism is mounted. The latter allows easy, rapid opening and closing of the collet. The drawbar's inner diameter determines the through-the-spindle bar diameter capacity of the lathe. Some collet-closer systems even allow opening and closing without stopping the spindle rotation. The closer on a manual lathe is either lever-style or handwheel-style. The closer on a CNC lathe is powered (electric, hydraulic, or pneumatic), {{and it may be}} controlled by various means: a foot pedal that the operator steps on when desired; a line in the program (for opening and closing under program control); or a button on the control panel.|$|E
40|$|Summary. Retrieval {{analysis}} of metal-on-metal hip stems showed negligible wear (< 1 mm 3) {{of the male}} taper surface in all cases. This supports retention of a well-fixed, undamaged stem during revision surgery Introduction. Wear and corrosion at the taper junction of metal-on-metal total hip replacements (MOM-THR) is likely {{to contribute to the}} high revision rates reported by joint registries. Studies have shown significant volumes of measured material loss at the <b>female</b> <b>taper</b> surface (femoral head), but no study has reported data for the male taper surface (stem). The decision to retain a well-fixed stem at revision is uncertain, particularly in cases where the taper junction may be responsible for the need for revision surgery. This is an important consideration given the increasing burden of MOM revisions and the considerable increase in morbidity associated with revision of the stem. The {{purpose of this study was}} to measure the volume of material loss of both the ‘female’ and ‘male’ taper surfaces and determine the relative contribution of each to the total material loss at the taper junction. Methods. This was a retrospective study of 90 retrieved components from revision surgery of large diameter MOM-THRs, in which revision included removal of the stem. The series included four contemporary metal-on-metal bearing designs and six different stem designs. We recorded all commonly reported clinical data. We then measured the volume of material loss from each of the taper and bearing surfaces using a validated method. Additionally, each of the taper surfaces were examined microscopically and corrosion was graded according to a well-published four-tiered classification. Results. The median volume of material lost from the male taper surface was 0. 29 mm 3 (0. 00 - 0. 83). This was significantly less than the median volume of material lost from the <b>female</b> <b>taper</b> surface (p < 0. 001), which was 1. 31 mm 3 (0. 57 - 17. 03). These results are shown in Figure 1. On average, the ‘male’ taper contributed 6. 1...|$|E
30|$|Conversely, {{some studies}} have {{described}} how large-diameter femoral heads {{may not have a}} significant effect on damage at the trunnion–taper junction. In a retrospective study examining 110 large-diameter (> 36  mm) THAs, Matthies et al. [12] demonstrated that the volume of material loss was negligible (< 1  mm 3) in the trunnions of all 36 femoral stems that were received. In fact, the median volume loss (0.29  mm 3) was significantly less than that of the <b>female</b> <b>taper,</b> the femoral head, and acetabular-bearing surfaces (P <  0.001 for all). However, for the trunnions in this study, it should be noted that a significant positive correlation was observed between corrosion score and volume of material loss (ρ =  0.72, 95  % CI =  0.44 – 0.87, P <  0.001). Triantafyllopoulos et al. [13] conducted a retrieval analysis of 154 THAs. Ultimately, they found no association between femoral head size and the degree of fretting and corrosion on tapers (P =  0.247; P =  0.837, respectively) or trunnions (P =  0.471; P =  0.868, respectively). While this type of damage may be a regular occurrence in THAs, neither fretting nor corrosion was associated with femoral head size.|$|E

40|$|It {{has been}} speculated that {{material}} loss, either as corrosion or wear, at the head–stem taper junction is implicated in the high revision rates reported for metal-on-metal total hip replacements. We measured the volume of material loss from the taper and bearing surfaces of retrieved devices, and investigated the associations with blood metal ion levels and the diagnosis of a cystic or solid pseudotumor. The median volumes of material lost from the female and male taper surfaces were 2. 0 and 0. 29 mm 3, respectively, while the median volumes of wear from the cup and head bearing surfaces were 1. 94 and 3. 44 mm 3, respectively. Material loss from the <b>female</b> <b>taper</b> {{was similar to that}} from the acetabular bearing surface (p ¼ 0. 55), but significantly less than that from the femoral bearing surface (p < 0. 001). Material loss from the male taper was less than that from both bearing surfaces (p < 0. 001). Multivariable analysis demonstrated no significant correlations between the volume of material lost from the taper surfaces and either blood cobalt or chromium ions, or the presence of pseudotumor. While a substantial volume of material is lost at the taper junction, the clinical significance of this debris remains unclear...|$|E
40|$|There {{have been}} a number of reports on the {{occurrence}} of taper corrosion and/or fretting and some have speculated on a link to the occurrence of adverse local tissue reaction specifically in relation to total hip replacement which have a metal-on-metal bearing. As such a study was carried out to compare the magnitude of material loss at the taper in a series of retrieved femoral heads used in metal-on-polyethylene bearings with that in a series of retrieved heads used in metal-on-metal bearings. A total of 36 metal-on-polyethylene and 21 metal-on-metal femoral components were included in the study all of which were received from a customer complaint database. Furthermore, a total of nine as-manufactured femoral components were included to provide a baseline for characterisation. All taper surfaces were assessed using an established corrosion scoring method and measurements were taken of the <b>female</b> <b>taper</b> surface using a contact profilometry. In the case of metal-on-metal components, the bearing wear was also assessed using coordinate metrology to determine whether or not there was a relationship between bearing and taper material loss in these cases. The study found that in this cohort the median value of metal-on-polyethylene taper loss was 1. 25 ?mm 3 with the consequent median value for metal-on-metal taper loss being 1. 75 ?mm 3. This study also suggests that manufacturing form can result in an apparent loss of material from the taper surface determined to have a median value of 0. 59 ?mm 3. Therefore, it is clear that form variability is a significant confounding factor in the measurement of material loss from the tapers of femoral heads retrieved following revision surgery.

30|$|Unfortunately, {{a shorter}} {{trunnion}} requires that its base sits within the taper of the femoral head, which {{may increase the}} likelihood of edge loading. Tan et al. [15] previously described this effect on the base in a retrieval analysis of 44 implants. When evaluating different regions of the trunnion, the authors noted significantly greater corrosion scores within the base zone (P =  0.018). They concluded that the base zone is subject to higher mechanical loading and greater torque forces compared to other regions. Brock et al. [16] retrieved 104 <b>female</b> <b>tapers</b> and 11 stem trunnions from 98 patients who experienced adverse reaction to metal debris. The authors used a co-ordinate measuring machine to assess for linear and volumetric wear of either shorter 12 -mm/ 14 -mm threaded trunnions or longer, smoother 11 -mm/ 13 -mm trunnions. They were able to identify significantly higher rates of material loss with the shorter, threaded 12 -mm/ 14 -mm trunnions compared to the longer, smooth 11 -mm/ 13 -mm trunnions (0.402 vs 0.123  mm 3 /year; P =  0.035). Porter et al. [4] conducted a retrieval analysis of 85 modular femoral stems released between 1983 and 2012 to determine how trunnion flexural rigidity and length have changed over time. They found a negative correlation between flexural rigidity (− 0.23; P =  0.04) and trunnion length (− 0.53; P <  0.001) with release date of the stem. Additionally, multiple regression analysis showed that flexural rigidity (β = − 0.17) and trunnion length (β = − 0.051) were independently correlated with time. Investigation of components in this study demonstrated that as new femoral stems were introduced, trunnions became less rigid and shorter.|$|R

In contrast, we know little about seasonal {{variation in}} female signals or signals produced jointly by males and females, such as the vocal duets of birds. Here, we examine how singing behaviour changes in relation to time of year and breeding stage in rufous-and-white wrens (Thryothorus rufalbus), neotropical songbirds where both males and females sing and where breeding partners coordinate songs to produce vocal duets. We recorded a colour-marked population of birds over an extended time period encompassing multiple breeding stages. Across all time frames and breeding stages, males sang at higher rates than females and male solos were more common than duets or female solos. Males and females showed divergent seasonal patterns of singing. Females sang more often early in the year, during the pre-breeding season, and <b>female</b> song <b>tapered</b> off as the breeding season progressed. Duetting followed a parallel pattern, which resulted from females showing less duet responsiveness to their partner’s songs later in the year. Male independent song rate peaked {{at the onset of the}} rainy season – a time when females become fertile – and males showed the highest level of duet responsiveness during this period. Our results suggest that early in the year, duets appear to be cooperative displays, functioning in joint territory defence and/or the coordination of breeding activities.

40|$|Measuring {{the amount}} of {{material}} loss {{in the case of}} revised hip replacements {{is considered to be a}} prerequisite of understanding and assessing the true in vivo performance of the implant. This paper outlines a method developed by the authors for quantifying taper material loss as well as more general taper interface parameters. Previous studies have mostly relied on visual inspection to assess the material loss at the taper interface, whereas this method aims to characterize any surface and form changes through the use of an out-of-roundness measurement machine. Along with assessing the volumetric wear, maximum linear penetration and taper contact length can also be determined. The method was applied to retrieved large head metal-on-metal femoral heads in order to quantify the material loss at this junction. Material loss from the <b>female</b> femoral head <b>taper</b> can be characterized as a localized area that is in contact with the stem taper surface.
