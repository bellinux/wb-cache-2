5|$|Ahead of the storm, the Guam National Weather Service {{issued a}} typhoon watch for Agrihan, Pagan, and Alamagan, {{as well as}} a high surf {{advisory}} for Guam. The watch was later upgraded to a warning, and was canceled after the typhoon exited the region. Flights were delayed or canceled to the region due to the storm and problems with the local aircraft communication system. During the storm, there were minor power outages on Saipan in two villages that were quickly restored. On Alamagan where the storm struck, six people rode out the storm <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> bunker.|$|E
5|$|Koschmider had {{converted}} {{a couple}} of strip clubs in the district into music venues, and he initially placed the Beatles at the Indra Club. After closing the Indra due to noise complaints, he moved them to the Kaiserkeller in October. When he learned they had been performing at the rival Top Ten Club in breach of their contract, he gave the band one month's termination notice, and reported the underage Harrison, who had obtained permission to stay in Hamburg by lying to the German authorities about his age. The authorities arranged for Harrison's deportation in late November. One week later, Koschmider had McCartney and Best arrested for arson after they set fire to a condom <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> corridor; the authorities deported them. Lennon returned to Liverpool in early December, while Sutcliffe remained in Hamburg until late February with his German fiancée Astrid Kirchherr, who took the first semi-professional photos of the Beatles.|$|E
5|$|M. alcathoe {{lives in}} small groups. In Greece, a {{maternity}} colony, containing three females and two juveniles, {{has been found}} in a plane tree. Additional roosts were found high in oak trees in Baden-Württemberg and Saxony-Anhalt. Twenty-seven roosting sites have been found in the Czech Republic, all but one in trees (the last was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> pole). Most of the tree roosts were in oaks (Quercus robur); others were in limes (Tilia cordata), birches (Betula pendula), and various other species. Its strong preference for roosting sites in trees is unusual among European bats. Roosts tend to be located high in the canopy, and are often in old trees. In summer, roosts may contain large groups of up to 80 individuals, but autumn roosts in the Czech Republic are occupied by smaller groups. M.alcathoe swarms from late July to mid-September in southern Poland.|$|E

5|$|The Triple Gate (Tam Quan) is {{accessible}} by both pedestrians and vehicles. Two-wheeled vehicles and pedestrians use {{the left and}} right wings respectively, and cars, buses, and trucks can use the central wing. The three gates represent emptiness, impermanence and middle-view. It is decorated with sculptures and engravings of lotuses, lanterns and swastikas, all prominent symbols in Buddhism. On the left hand side of the grounds, there is a Bodhi tree, a symbol of the enlightenment of the Buddha. The tree is located <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> lotus, and around it are eight samsara-wheel-shaped signs that represent the Noble Eightfold Path. Signs with text explain each of the eight paths.|$|E
5|$|The new Dunston B Power Station was {{designed}} by consulting engineers Merz & McLellan. Its design {{was different from the}} design of other power stations at the time because it enclosed the machinery in a steel frame clad with glass. This was a departure from the usual power station designs, which normally enclosed the machinery <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> or brick wall. Dunston B is thought to be the first power station in the UK and possibly even the world to be built in this way. The station was also the first in the world to use metal clad switchgear at a voltage as high as 66,000V.|$|E
5|$|The {{upper reaches}} of the {{watershed}} of Spring Brook are mountainous and swampy. Further downstream, the stream flows through a water gap in the Moosic Mountains. Sandstone, shale, and some coal are present {{in the vicinity of the}} stream. It has been channelized <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> channel for part of its length and is the main source of flooding in Spring Brook Township, Lackawanna County. The stream is the second-largest tributary of the Lackawanna River. Reservoirs on Spring Brook include the Spring Brook Intake, the Nesbitt Reservoir, the Watres Reservoir. There are three dams on the stream. The watershed is mainly forested, with only a small amount of urban land.|$|E

A prestressed box beam or girders bridge carrying State Route 2044 across the stream was built <b>in</b> 1974. <b>A</b> two-span <b>concrete</b> culvert bridge carrying State Route 2014 was built over Glade Run in 1978 100 ft north of Muncy. In 1980, another concrete culvert bridge was built across the stream, this one 2 mi southeast of Muncy and carrying State Route 2009.|$|R

25|$|Some main {{innovations}} of the W124 series {{were related}} to occupant safety. Derived from the Mercedes 190 (W201), with which the W124 shares the basic layout, its likewise angular body was designed to withstand an offset-crash <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> barrier at some 35mph (56km/h) without serious harm to the occupants and a largely undamaged passenger cabin, a windshield that stays in place and doors easily opened without special recovery tools. This crash-test configuration became the base for the Euro-NCAP procedure currently being the standard crash-test configuration in the EU. Unlike Euro-NCAP, Mercedes required {{the body of the}} W124 to withstand an offset impact from the front and from the rear.|$|E
25|$|The Oregon Coast Aquarium (OCA) in Newport, Oregon {{where the}} orca Keiko was kept {{prior to his}} {{translocation}} to Iceland, offered its facilities to rehabilitate Springer for a one-year period, after which a scientific panel would {{determine whether or not}} she was fit to return to Johnstone Strait, BC. Media reports soon revealed that OCA was deep in debt and bound by an agreement with the Free Willy-Keiko Foundation (FWKF) that Keiko's former tank, built by FWKF, could never again house a wild orca. Furthermore, growing scientific opinion was that rehabilitating Springer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> tank would further acclimate the orca to humans and likely result in permanent captivity. OCA withdrew its offer.|$|E

25|$|Poorly fed {{and cared}} for, his health rapidly {{declined}} in prison. Dysentery racked his intestines {{and he was}} confined to a small cell. One night he managed to escape his cell by squeezing through the narrow confines of its window. Over the next nights, and during his transfer to the prisoners quarters, he forged an exit tunnel which he used on frequent raids to the Turkish Army food stores next-door. One night he was discovered and locked <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> box for two weeks. Near death, he was repatriated back to Britain and left Constantinople camp on 1 April 1915. On the two-month journey he contracted malaria once again, surviving the parasite before reaching England via Bulgaria and Greece.|$|E
25|$|This {{is one of}} {{a series}} of brick toilet blocks located {{throughout}} the site thought to be built between World War I and World War II. It has been refurbished, extended to the rear and none of the original fittings remain. The female toilets are housed partly <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> block extension and the male toilets are located in the original low-set brick building. The original part of the building contains glazed face-brick walls with feature panels of roughcast render. Set symmetrically above the rendered panels are fixed timber louvres for ventilation. The roof is hipped, clad in short sheets of corrugated iron. Screen walls of concrete block and ribbed steel, with a skillion roof above, have been added to the front of the building.|$|E
25|$|Near the {{existing}} Sanford Field {{was a low}} area between the Old Campus (to the north) and the Ag Campus (to the south) with a small creek (Tanyard Creek) running through it, creating a clearly preferable choice for {{the location of the}} new stadium. This natural valley containing Tanyard Creek would result in reduced costs, as stands could be built on the rising sides of the hill, while the creek could be enclosed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>concrete</b> culvert, on top of which the field would be constructed. The architect for the stadium was TC Atwood of Chapel Hill, North Carolina, where North Carolina's Kenan Memorial Stadium had just been completed with a similar design. The 30,000-seat stadium was built in large part with convict labor, as were many public works projects of that era.|$|E
