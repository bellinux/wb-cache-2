25|$|In 1987, {{the choir}} held a lavish celebration for its 60-year anniversary: on January 10, the Vienna Boys' Choir sang a sold out <b>joint</b> <b>performance</b> with the KKB in Basel's Stadtcasino. At {{the end of}} February, the choir was invited to the Festival International de Chant Choral in Nantes. The large jubilee weekend, with choirs from {{throughout}} Europe and more than 600 participants from the Basel area, took place on May 16 and 17.

In August, the KKB appeared in the Lucerne Festival and participated in a performance of Leonard Bernstein's Chichester Psalms. To conclude the year, a tour took place in the Bernese Oberland to commemorate the choir's first concert tour.|$|E
25|$|After the {{outbreak}} of World War II, rehearing became increasingly more difficult, and in 1940 the rehearsal space changed yet again, first to the City of Basel Music Academy, then to the kindergarten at the Basel Mission. Since Ulbrich had {{to serve in the}} military until July, 1940, Emil Herrmann and Helene Sandreuter were entrusted with the interim direction of the choir, leading to temporary cessation of voice lessons. Meanwhile, the size of the choir had shrunk by 25 percent. Ulbrich, who was still on duty, developed a Christmas liturgy with the choir. In 1941, a <b>joint</b> <b>performance</b> with the Schola Cantorum took place. Ernst Lipp, who had been intimately involved with the development of the choir since its founding, died that same year. In 1942 and 1943, interest in joining the choir fell dramatically from its generally high levels, and the choir had only 16 members in May, 1943, who were not of a high enough quality to give a successful concert with the Schola Cantorum at the Barfüsserkirche ("Barefeet Church"). Fortunately, by 1944 the choir had grown back to 30 members. In May, 1945, the choir organized a thanksgiving service {{on the occasion of the}} end of the war.|$|E

500|$|Since {{her debut}} in 1990, Carey's career was heavily {{calculated}} {{and controlled by}} her husband and head of her label Sony Music Entertainment, Tommy Mottola. For years, Carey's albums had consisted of slow and meaningful ballads, devoid of any guest appearances or hip hop. In January 1995, as she recorded Daydream, Carey began taking more control over her musical style and genre influences. She enlisted the production skills and rap styles of Ol' Dirty Bastard, who was featured on the remix of her song [...] "Fantasy." [...] While Mottola was hesitant at first, Carey's influence paid off: the song became an international chart topper, with critics calling their <b>joint</b> <b>performance</b> one of the pioneering songs of pop and R musical collaborations.|$|E

After she was removed from the stage, a new date was chosen for the rehearsal, one that would accommodate both Houston and Carey.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the effect of}} modularity, architectural knowledge and joint measurability on <b>joint</b> supplier <b>performance</b> in multisourcing settings.

However, {{little is known about}} the effect of the guardian supplier on the factors that may improve <b>joint</b> supplier <b>performance.</b> A study of 190 client firms suggests that in the non-guardian supplier model (i. e. the client firm governs the supplier network), modularity, architectural knowledge and joint measurability positively affect <b>joint</b> supplier <b>performance.</b> In the case of a guardian supplier model, modularity and architectural knowledge no longer affect joint supplier performance; however, joint measurability still remains important for <b>joint</b> supplier <b>performance.</b> Our results hint at the importance of certain capabilities that the client firm needs to possess in order to improve <b>joint</b> supplier <b>performance</b> subject to its choice of a guardian supplier...|$|R

40|$|The {{study of}} <b>joint</b> venture <b>performance</b> in China is {{important}} {{due to the}} increasing number of establishments and value of foreign investment. However, prior studies have mainly focused their analysis on the joint ventures in developed countries, and their findings cannot be generalized directly to the Chinese setting. This article fills the gap by reviewing the recent studies of the factors affecting <b>joint</b> venture <b>performance</b> in PRC. Basing on the studies of <b>joint</b> venture <b>performance</b> in China, {{it can be seen that}} Chinese and U. S. managers prefer to use different criteria to evaluate the performance of IJV. For instance, due to the state objective and socialist ideology, Chinese side mainly evaluate the performance of IJVs on the basic of economic development dimensions, while U. S. managers prefer to use enterprise output measures to evaluate IJV performance. In addition, most recent studies of factors affecting <b>joint</b> venture <b>performance</b> in China emphasize on partner-related factors and joint venture-related factors, instead of the environment factors of joint venture.
