40|$|A cross {{sectional}} {{study was conducted}} among military <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers in the two largest mechanized battalions with the objective to determine the prevalence of low back pain (LBP), and its association with whole body vibration (WBV) and other associated factors. A self-administered questionnaire and Human Vibration Meter were used in this study. A total of 159 respondents {{participated in this study}} and 102 (64. 2 %) of them were subjected to WBV measurement. One-hundred-and–seventeen respondents complained of LBP for the past 12 months giving a prevalence of 73. 6 %. The prevalence of LBP among tracked <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers was higher (81. 7 %) as compared to wheeled <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicle</b> drivers (67. 0 %). The mean acceleration at Z–axis in tracked <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> (1. 09 ± 0. 26 ms- 2) and wheeled <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> (0. 33 ± 0. 07 ms- 2) were the dominant vibration directions. The mean estimated vibration dose value (eVDV) for eight-hour daily exposure at Z–axis (19. 86 ± 4. 72 ms- 1. 75) in tracked <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> showed the highest estimation. Based on the European Vibration Directive (2002), the mean eVDV at Z–axis in tracked <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles</b> exceeded exposure action value (EAV) (> 9. 1 ms- 1. 75), but did not exceed exposure limit value (ELV) (< 21. 0 ms- 1. 75). Logistic regression analysis revealed that only driving in forward bending sitting posture (OR= 3. 63, 95 % CI 1. 06 – 12. 42) and WBV exposure at X-axis (OR= 1. 94, 95 % CI 1. 02 – 3. 69) were significant risk factors to LBP. Preventive measures should be implemented to minimize risk of WBV and to improve ergonomic postures among drivers.

25|$|M-30 howitzers were {{primarily}} employed for indirect fire against enemy personnel. They {{were also used}} against field fortifications, for clearing minefields and for breaching barbed wire. Their HE-fragmentation shells presented a danger to <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles.</b> Fragments created by the explosion could penetrate up to 20mm of armour, - enough against thinly <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles.</b> The shells could also damage chassis, sights or other elements of heavier <b>armoured</b> <b>vehicles.</b>|$|R
