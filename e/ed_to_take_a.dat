40|$|We de ne a typed bisimulation {{equivalence}} for {{the language}} Dpi, a dis- tributed {{version of the}} -calculus in which processes may migrate between dynamically created locations. It takes into account resource access policies, which can be imple- mented in Dpi using a novel form of dynamic capability types. The equivalence, based on typed actions between con gurations, is justi ed by showing that it is fully-abstract {{with respect to a}} natural distributed version of a contextual equivalence. In {{the second part of the}} paper we study the e ect of controlling the migration of processes. This a ects the ability to perform observations at speci c locations, as the observer may be denied access. We show how the typed actions can be modi <b>ed</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> this into account, and generalise the full-abstraction result to this more delicate scenario...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe large {{integration}} of wind energy into electrical systems poses important {{challenges to the}} power operators in the scheduling of the production and {{in the management of}} the network. This leads to the necessity to modify the current industry procedures, such as the Unit Commitment (UC) and the Economic Dispatch (<b>ED),</b> <b>to</b> <b>take</b> into account large amounts of wind power production. Even if an exhaustive literature exists on the general Unit Commitment problem, devoted on how to improve its mathematical formulation and its solution algorithm, the research that considers the Unit Commitment problem with wind generators is limited. In this work, a new Unit commitment model in presence of wind energy resources has been defined and analyzed, in order to formulate and solve the problem of determining the best configuration (optimal mix) of available thermal, hydro and wind power plants, taking into account proper emission considerations and the risk {{associated with the use of}} wind turbines...|$|R
