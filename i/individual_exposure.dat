40|$|Abstract Background The {{present study}} {{protocol}} {{is designed to}} assess the relationship between outdoor air pollution and low birth weight and preterm births outcomes performing a semi-ecological analysis. Semi-ecological design studies are widely used to assess effects of air pollution in humans. In this type of analysis, health outcomes and covariates are measured in <b>individuals</b> and <b>exposure</b> assignments are usually based on air quality monitor stations. Therefore, estimating <b>individual</b> <b>exposures</b> {{are one of the}} major challenges when investigating these relationships with a semi-ecologic design. Methods/Design Semi-ecologic study consisting of a retrospective cohort study with ecologic assignment of exposure is applied. Health outcomes and covariates are collected at Primary Health Care Center. Data from pregnant registry, clinical record and specific questionnaire administered orally to the mothers of children born in period 2007 - 2010 in Portuguese Alentejo Litoral region, are collected by the research team. Outdoor air pollution data are collected with a lichen diversity biomonitoring program, and <b>individual</b> pregnancy <b>exposures</b> are assessed with spatial geostatistical simulation, which provides the basis for uncertainty analysis of <b>individual</b> <b>exposures.</b> Awareness of outdoor air pollution uncertainty will improve validity of <b>individual</b> <b>exposures</b> assignments for further statistical analysis with multivariate regression models. Discussion Exposure misclassification is an issue of concern in semi-ecological design. In this study, personal exposures are assigned to each pregnant using geocoded addresses data. A stochastic simulation method is applied to lichen diversity values index measured at biomonitoring survey locations, in order to assess spatial uncertainty of lichen diversity value index at each geocoded address. These methods assume a model for spatial autocorrelation of exposure and provide a distribution of exposures in each study location. We believe that variability of simulated exposure values at geocoded addresses will improve knowledge on variability of exposures, improving therefore validity of <b>individual</b> <b>exposures</b> to input in posterior statistical analysis. </p...|$|R

In 2000, Silent Spring's research was honored with a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency Environmental Merit Award.|$|E
5000|$|With an NFPA 704 {{health hazard}} rating of 2, silver iodide can cause {{temporary}} incapacitation or possible residual injury to humans and mammals with intense or chronic exposure. However, {{there have been}} several detailed ecological studies that showed negligible environmental and health impacts. [...] The toxicity of silver and silver compounds (from silver iodide) was shown to be of low order in some studies. These findings likely result from the minute amounts of silver generated by cloud seeding, which are about one percent of industry emissions into the atmosphere {{in many parts of the}} world, or <b>individual</b> <b>exposure</b> from tooth fillings.|$|E
50|$|One way to {{test this}} idea is {{to see whether the}} {{frequency}} of co-occurrence of light spectra predicts simultaneous color contrast effects (see side image, Fig. 1). Long and Purves showed that by sampling thousands of natural images, analysis of associations between target colors and the colors of their surrounds could explain perceptual effects like those seen on the right. Rather than explaining the diverging color percepts as unfortunate byproducts of a normally veridical color perception mechanism, according to this work the different colors humans see are simply the byproducts of our species and <b>individual</b> <b>exposure</b> to the distribution of color spectra in the world.|$|E

50|$|In {{a limited}} partnership, {{it is the}} general partner who remains liable for the debts and {{obligations}} of the entity. For larger risk exposure, a company (corporation) may be formed {{to serve as the}} general partner. A corporate general partner is protected from direct attack by a judgment creditor because the ultimate liability for the debts and obligations rests with the shareholders. By spreading share ownership, <b>individual</b> <b>exposure</b> is considerably reduced. Even without a corporate general partner, risk can be spread by distribution of limited partnership shares. If a judgment creditor obtains a charging order against one partner, the order goes to that partners share in distributions from the partnership, and not to the entire business.|$|E

NIOSH requests the energy employee’s <b>individual</b> <b>exposure</b> records from DOE and interviews the claimant or survivors to obtain information to use in the dose reconstruction. NIOSH also collects all relevant data regarding the individual’s work site, if available, to complete the dose reconstruction. Once the dose reconstruction is complete, NIOSH sends the dose reconstruction back to DOL and DOL makes compensation decisions. The office responsible for completing dose reconstructions for NIOSH is the Office of Compensation Analysis and Support (OCAS).|$|E

Police learn how to behave, discretion, morals and what to think from their shared experiences with other police officers. New recruits develop definitions with their peers either positive or negative. These definitions are then reinforced, positively or negatively, by the rewards or punishments (either real or perceived) that follow their behavior. For example, a new recruit may be given an order by his peer to arrest an individual sitting {{in the passenger seat}} for a DUI. This action can end up negatively or positively for the officer depending on how the situation is perceived by the court later on.|$|E

50|$|Both Ukraine and Belarus, {{in their}} first months of independence, lowered legal {{radiation}} thresholds from the Soviet Union's previous, elevated thresholds (from 35 rems per lifetime under the USSR to 7 rems per lifetime in Ukraine and 0.1 rems per year in Belarus). This required an expansion of territories that were considered contaminated. In Ukraine, over 500,000 people have now been resettled, {{many of whom have}} become applicants for medical and other welfare. Ukraine also maintains the destroyed reactor, for which it employs a very large workforce in order to keep <b>individual</b> <b>exposure</b> times low. Many of these workers have since registered disabilities and enrolled for welfare. In Ukraine, the Chernobyl disaster was an icon of the nationalist movement, symbolic of all that was wrong with the Soviet Union, and welfare became a key platform for winning independence. Ukraine has since developed a massive and burdensome welfare system that has become increasingly corrupt and ineffective. It has presented its greatly increased welfare demands since 1991 as a demonstration of its own moral legitimacy, and as an argument for needing foreign aid. Belarus, on the other hand, was politically weak when it gained independence, and looked to Moscow for guidance; in many ways it has returned to the old Soviet policy of secrecy and denial.|$|E

This study investigates {{both individual and}} population {{exposure to}} ultra-fine particle in the Twin Cities metropolitan area, Minnesota, by combining an on-road UFP concentration model with people’s travel patterns derived from different traffic monitoring data sources. Spatial and temporal patterns of exposure to UFP among freeway users are revealed through analysis of loop-detector traffic data, while <b>individual</b> <b>exposure</b> is estimated based on GPS travel trajectories. A few hot spots near major freeway interchanges represents a majority of total exposure to UFP, and the exposure during workday morning and afternoon peak periods is the highest. Significant disparity in <b>individual</b> <b>exposure</b> to UFP among population is observed. In general, <b>individual</b> <b>exposure</b> to UFP follows a log-normal distribution.
