5|$|In some {{adaptations of}} the Ramayana, other {{characters}} also use surrogates to save themselves from Ravana. A Tamil text narrates how Ravana once asks for Parvati as boon {{from her husband}} Shiva, however Vishnu – disguised as a sage – deludes Ravana into believing Shiva granted him an illusionary Parvati. Ravana entrusts Parvati to Vishnu and mediates again to compel Shiva {{to give him the}} real Parvati. This time, Shiva gives an illusionary Parvati, which he accepts as the real one and returns to Lanka with her. In the Malay Ramayana, Ravana sets <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Rama's mother, however she transforms a frog into her image and sends this surrogate to be Ravana's wife.|$|E
5|$|Jaidev (Pawan Kalyan) is an {{accomplished}} hitman {{and the most}} trusted aide of Bhagavan (Jackie Shroff), who is the supreme don of Kolkata. Jaidev remains loyal {{to him as he}} helped in seeking revenge with the people who raped his mother and sister when he came to Kolkata in his childhood after his father's death. They share a business rivalry with Kulkarni (Atul Kulkarni), who aims to overthrow Bhagavan. Things are smooth until Bhagwan’s son Munna (Adivi Sesh) returns to India. He is a psychotic and highly impulsive youngster. He has <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> club dancer Jahnavi (Anjali Lavania), but she rejects him as she adores Jaidev.|$|E

5|$|The {{presence}} {{of death is}} felt throughout the poem, although it is mentioned explicitly only in the final line. The moon, {{a symbol of the}} beloved, sinks steadily as the poem progresses, until its abrupt drop in the penultimate stanza. That the speaker links Lucy with the moon is clear, though his reasons are unclear. The moon nevertheless plays {{a significant role in the}} action of the poem: as the lover imagines the moon slowly sinking behind Lucy's cottage, he is entranced by its motion. By the fifth stanza, the speaker has been lulled into a somnambulistic trance—he sleeps while still keeping <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the moon (lines 17–20).|$|E
5|$|The Genghis Khan {{concentrates}} on {{the rise of the}} divided, constantly warring tribes of Mongolia into the mighty, fearsome Mongol Empire. Early missions of the campaign concentrate on uniting the several steppe tribes whilst also dealing with the 'Kara-Khitai', sworn enemies of Genghis Khan. With the other tribes either united or destroyed, Genghis now sets <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> world domination. The vast riches of the Khwaremia domain in Persia would be the obvious choice, but despite a pledge of support to the Mongols, the technologically superior Chinese Kingdoms have refused, thereby setting another example where Genghis directs his next campaign. With the entirety of China now under Mongolian rule, the Mongol horde now has the technology capable of knocking down the fortifications of Persia, and beyond.|$|E

25|$|In January 2006, Paxman was {{the subject}} of an episode of the BBC {{genealogy}} series Who Do You Think You Are?. The documentary concluded that he was descended from Roger Packsman, a 14th-century politician from Suffolk who had changed his name to Paxman in order to impress the electorate (pax being Latin for 'peace'). Paxman's maternal grandmother was born in Glasgow, Scotland. The programme generated much publicity before its transmission by displaying him with tears in <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> camera when informed that his impoverished great-grandmother Mary McKay's poor relief had been revoked because she had a child out of wedlock.|$|E
25|$|The 1964 Republican electors {{were the}} first since Reconstruction to prevail in Alabama. The Goldwater-Miller slate {{received}} 479,085 votes (69.5 percent) to the unpledged electors' 209,848 (30.5 percent). The Republican tide also brought to victory five Republican members of the United States House of Representatives, including William Louis Dickinson, who held the Montgomery-based district seat until 1993, and James D. Martin, the Gadsden oil products dealer who defeated then State Senator George C. Hawkins for the U.S. House seat formerly held by Carl Elliott. Hardly yet sworn into the U.S. House, Martin already had <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Wallace's own position as governor.|$|E
25|$|Having {{quit the}} army in Naples, Avitabile set <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a career abroad. His initial idea was to, as many of his countrymen, seek fortune in America but this ended in a {{shipwreck}} off Marseille. Instead, he was advised to seek employment to the east. In Constantinople he was approached by {{an agent of the}} Persian Shah Fath Ali Shah recruiting European officers; in 1820, Avitabile took service with the Persian Shah. He remained in this employment for six years, during which period he rose to the rank of khan and a grade of colonel in the Persian army. Here he also met Claude August Court who would later accompany him on the travel to Punjab. Avitabile was rewarded for his services by two of Persia's highest decorations as Grand Commander of The Lion and Sun and of The Two Lions and Crown, but found the pay lacking. When he heard favourable notice from Jean-Baptiste Ventura of his employment in Punjab Ventura again broke up to travel further to the east.|$|E

25|$|The European Age of {{discovery}} brought Europe's then superpower the Portuguese empire {{to the coast}} of East Africa, {{which at the time}} enjoyed a flourishing trade with foreign nations. The wealthy southeastern city-states of Kilwa, Mombasa, Malindi, Pate and Lamu were all systematically sacked and plundered by the Portuguese. Tristão da Cunha then set <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Ajuran territory, where the battle of Barawa was fought. After a long period of engagement, the Portuguese soldiers burned the city and looted it. However, fierce resistance by the local population and soldiers resulted in the failure of the Portuguese to permanently occupy the city, and the inhabitants who had fled to the interior would eventually return and rebuild the city. After Barawa, Tristão would set sail for Mogadishu, which was the richest city on the East African coast. But word had spread of what had happened in Barawa, and a large troop mobilization had taken place. Many horsemen, soldiers and battleships in defense positions were now guarding the city. Nevertheless, Tristão still opted to storm and attempt to conquer the city, although every officer and soldier in his army opposed this, fearing certain defeat if they were to engage their opponents in battle. Tristão heeded their advice and sailed for Socotra instead. After the battle the city of Barawa quickly recovered from the attack.|$|E
500|$|In 1929, the 17-year-old Como met Roselle Belline at {{a picnic}} on Chartiers Creek that {{attracted}} many young people from the Canonsburg area. Como, who attended the cookout with another girl, did not spot Roselle until everyone was around the campfire singing and the gathering was coming to a close. When it came Como's turn to sing, he chose [...] "More Than You Know", with <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Roselle for the entire song. The teenage sweethearts were married July 31, 1933. They raised three children, Ronnie, David, and Terri, with traditional, non-show-business values. Because Perry Como believed his professional life and his personal life should be kept separate, he declined repeated interview requests from Edward R. Murrow's Person to Person.|$|E
500|$|In late September 2014, Guggenheim {{revealed}} that the Arrow episode would be titled [...] "The Brave and The Bold", {{a reference to a}} title shared by many comic book series published by DC Comics which feature super-hero team-ups, including the Flash and Green Arrow. Guggenheim said: I've never had so much fun writing a script before ... It was such a blast to work on... I keep telling everyone that we should try for Avengers. It's these two heroes together with a big production value. ... There's the opportunity for inside jokes, and seeing all of the characters together. What happens when Cisco gets <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Thea? There are moments like that, that you just can’t do in a normal episode....It's just so much fun. In October 2014, the title of The Flash episode was announced as [...] "Flash vs. Arrow". Kreisberg {{revealed that}} the writers' rooms for both shows were merged while working on the scripts for the episodes, similar to [...] "throwing two casts together".|$|E

500|$|Patrick Duffy, {{who would}} play Pamela's {{on-screen}} love, knew the part was ideal for Principal {{the minute he}} set <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> her. He recalled {{that one of the}} finalists for Pamela [...] "was a remarkably talented young actress from New York... really good. , in walked Victoria Principal with the tightest jeans I've ever seen and the most unbelievable blouse. I just went, 'Hello, Pam'. I knew {{she was going to be}} Pam Ewing." [...] Producer Michael Filerman (Knots Landing and Falcon Crest) offered insight, [...] "Principal really wanted that role...and worked very hard to get it. And there's a humanity about her that's just winning. And the camera likes her very much. The camera just loves her. That's real important." [...] During the pilot filming, Principal became very close with teenaged actress Charlene Tilton, who played Lucy Ewing. Principal explained that [...] "the location shooting was hard on Tilton, who was only seventeen and had never been away from home".|$|E
500|$|Thomas Cromwell, Henry's Chief Minister, {{had long}} since had <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> the wealth of English monasteries; {{at the time they}} owned {{approximately}} a quarter of all the realm's landed wealth. Starting in 1534, Cromwell had each of the monasteries inspected, with the establishment's wealth and endowments recorded, along with frequent reports of impropriety, vice and excess. These reports were compiled into volumes known as the Valor Ecclesiasticus. Leicester abbey was inspected by Richard Layton, in 1535, who complimented Abbot Bourchier as an honest man, but who tried to bring charges of [...] "adultery and unnatural vice" [...] against the abbey's canons. Abbot Bourchier sought to gain Thomas Cromwell's favour to protect his canons and abbey; in 1536 sending him £100 and gifts of sheep and oxen. This was ultimately fruitless: Cromwell had convinced King Henry of the immoral behaviour within England's monasteries and thus between 1536 and 1541 they were all suppressed and dissolved: their land, property and wealth transferred to the king. The abbot's attempts at bribery could not save Leicester Abbey, and it was finally surrendered to the crown for dissolution in 1538.|$|E
500|$|The {{new system}} of {{government}} in Athens opened up a wealth of opportunity for men like Themistocles, who previously {{would have had no}} access to power. Moreover, the new institutions of the democracy required skills that had previously been unimportant in government. Themistocles was to prove himself a master of the new system; [...] "he could infight, he could network, he could spin... and crucially, he knew how to make himself visible." [...] Themistocles moved to the Ceramicus, a down-market part of Athens. This move marked him out as a 'man of the people', and allowed him to interact more easily with ordinary citizens. He began building up a support base among these newly empowered citizens: [...] "he wooed the poor; and they, not used to being courted, duly loved him back. Touring the taverns, the markets, the docks, canvassing where no politician had thought to canvas before, making sure never to forget a single voter's name, Themistocles had set <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> a radical new constituency" [...] However, he took care to ensure that he did not alienate the nobility of Athens. He began to practice law, the first person in Athens to prepare for public life in this way. His ability as attorney and arbitrator, used {{in the service of the}} common people, gained him further popularity.|$|E

500|$|Weinberg rose {{to success}} as the drummer for Springsteen's E Street Band, as his {{powerful}} yet controlled beat solved the E Street Band's drumming instabilities. On Born to Run (1975), Weinberg's drumming evoked {{two of his}} idols, Ringo Starr and Levon Helm, and he covered his snare drum with heavy paper towels to capture some of the Memphis soul sound. While travelling on tour, Weinberg became known for his exact requests, such as specifying the particular brand of paper towels to use for his drums or the standards for his hotel rooms. Weinberg never adopted the [...] "rock and roll lifestyle"; he treated his music seriously and kept to the mantra, [...] "Show up, do a good job, and give them more than their money's worth." [...] One compromise Weinberg did have to make was sometimes playing on the High Holy Days. During shows, Springsteen built up the personas of his bandmates, and Weinberg was frequently referred to as [...] "the Mighty Max". Weinberg started a long practice of keeping <b>his</b> <b>eyes</b> <b>on</b> Springsteen every moment during the show, even when Springsteen was behind the stage, as he never knew when Springsteen would change a tempo or suddenly deviate from the set list. Decades later, E Street guitarist Steve Van Zandt would say of Weinberg, [...] "What nobody understands is {{that not only is}} Max a great drummer, Max reads Bruce's mind. You can't learn that." [...] Weinberg bought a house overlooking the water in Atlantic Highlands, New Jersey, triggering a lifelong interest in real estate and home design.|$|E
