40|$|The {{service life}} of {{concrete}} structures {{is directly related}} to their ability to impede fluid ingress. The service life of concrete infrastructure is drastically affected by presence of cracks. Cracks provide preferential paths for fluid ingress, resulting in acceleration of degradation processes. Therefore, information about the location and the extent of damage is necessary for accurate service life prediction of infrastructure. ^ This thesis presents development and application of several electrically-based methods for detecting the time of cracking and location of cracks in concrete elements. These methods include the use of electrically conductive thin films at the surface of concrete elements and use of electrically conductive concrete materials. These methods are utilized to detect and quantify damage in both small-scale laboratory specimens and large-scale structures. In addition, acoustic emission is used to detect and quantify damage in concrete materials. Acoustic emission has been used in this work to quantify both the damage that occurs at material level and also to detect and quantify damage in large structures. ^ In addition to detecting and quantifying damage in cement-based materials and elements, this thesis studies moisture transport in concrete materials. Specifically, physical measurements and numerical simulations have been used to study the unsaturated flow in saw-cut geometries and drying of concrete materials. ^ This study begins by developing an electrically-based method to detect the time of cracking and the location of the cracks. This method uses an electrically conductive thin film that is applied {{to the surface of the}} cementitious materials. The electrical resistance of this film is monitored as the substrate cracks. A sudden increase in the electrical resistance of the thin film corresponds with the time of cracking. To facilitate rapid and simultaneous interrogation of the response of multiple conductive thin film elements, a <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> <b>circuit</b> (FSC) has been developed. The accuracy and sensitivity of the thin film method was examined by using acoustic emission measurements, image analysis, and strain measurements using strain gages on restrained concrete elements. ^ In the second phase of this study, the developed electrical sensing methods are used to detect and quantify damage in buried pipelines. In addition to conductive thin films, electrically conductive concrete is developed and used. These electrically-based methods are used along with acoustic emission and magnetic sensors to obtain information about progression of damage in buried segmented concrete pipelines in the vicinity of permanent ground displacement. Using these methods it was observed that the majority of the damage to the pipe segments was localized at the joints, especially the bell sections while the damage to the spigots was minimal. The damage extended away from the joints in the pipe segments in the immediate vicinity of the fault line. Telescoping (i. e., crushing of the bell-and-spigot) was a primary mode of failure. ^ In the third phase of this work, acoustic emission was used to detect and quantify damage in cement-based composites due to volume change of aggregates and due to aggregate expansion caused by alkali silica reaction (ASR). Use of acoustic emission to detect and quantify damage due to ASR is especially attractive since the assessment of potential for alkali reactivity in concrete materials can be difficult and time consuming using traditional length change measurements. In this phase continuous and simultaneous length change measurements on potentially reactive aggregates were performed. Length change measurements were performed along with acoustic emission measurements to compare the results and provide insight to the mechanism of ASR. The results indicate that use of acoustic emission is a potential method for rapid assessment of damage due to ASR. ^ Finally, in the fourth phase of the present study, using numerical and experimental methods, moisture movement in cement-based materials in the form of unsaturated fluid transport and drying was studied. The effect of fluid properties on unsaturated fluid transport and drying of cement-based materials was investigated. In dealing with unsaturated flow, a great emphasis is placed on saw-cut geometries. The saw-cut geometry has well-defined boundary conditions, and can be used to provide insight to flow in crack-like geometries. In addition to unsaturated flow and drying of cement-based materials, in this phase of the study the pressure plate apparatus was used to characterize porous light weight aggregates that are used for internal curing of concrete. The use of pressure plate enables characterizing light weight aggregates at very high relative humidities where application of gravimetric methods becomes very difficult. ...|$|E

40|$|Reconfigurable antennas have {{recently}} formed a popular research topic. They are attracting {{the interest of}} many industry professionals. This is basically due to the growing demands for more functionality while occupying the same or even smaller physical volume. Using various antennas for wireless applications is no longer effective because having several antennas take too much space. Reconfigurable antennas are the best solution to provide a better performance in terms of flexibility, efficiency and combination of several electromagnetic spectrum applications. <b>Frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surfaces are exploited in many communication applications, especially in designing reconfigurable antennas due {{to their ability to}} control the electromagnetic field. A <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surface is an important figure concept in reconfigurable antenna structures and has developed rapidly due to their unique properties in suppressing the surface wave propagation. The main topic of this research is to design new reconfigurable radiation pattern antennas with enhanced performance by using switchable <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surfaces. The antenna consists of a central radiating source surrounded by switchable <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surface unit cells to give the antenna beam, shaping capability to scan 360 degree in the azimuth plane. Novel switchable <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surface unit cells with various structures are designed and their characteristics are compared in both the reflective and transparent states. The reconfigurable response is the basic concept in the antenna design. This is achieved by adding PIN diodes to the lines that will connect or disconnect the unit cells and transform the <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surface to be either a reflective or a transparent surface. As a consequence, switching the <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surface PIN diodes leads to control the antenna beam direction. In this thesis, two novel reconfigurable antennas with <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surface unit cells are presented, each antenna works at a different frequency band.

The research topic in this thesis includes investigations and techniques to increase the bandwidth and improve the radiation characteristics of the reconfigurable antennas by using new switchable <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surface unit cells. Experimental results show the preference of the proposed antennas over those presented in the literature.

The solution developed within this dissertation to solve these problems was to use guided-mode resonance phenomenon to create all-dielectric <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> surfaces that could survive these extreme environments. ^ To fully understand how these devices work, three different computational electromagnetic methods are formulated and implemented. The formulation of these methods start with the differential form of Maxwellâs equation and are derived {{all the way down}} to the final simulation state.

In [11, 12], these problems have been extended to also consider transmitter IQ imbalance together with receiver IQ imbalance and CFO. However, all these works consider only the effects of frequency independent IQ imbalance. For wideband communication systems it is important to also consider <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> distortions introduced by IQ imbalances. These <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> distortions arise mainly due to mismatched filters in the I and Q branch of the front-end. In [13, 14], efficient blind compensation schemes for <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> receiver IQ Imbalance have been developed. Recently in [15], a compensation scheme has been proposed that can decouple the <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> receiver IQ imbalance from the channel distortion, resulting in a reliable compensation with a small training overhead. In [16 â 18], joint compensation of <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> transmitter and receiver IQ imbalance has been considered with residual CFO, no CFO and under high mobility conditions respectively. In [19], we have proposed a generally applicable adaptive frequency domain equalizer for the joint compensation of <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> transmitter/receiver IQ imbalance and channel distortion, for the case of an insufficient cyclic prefix (CP) length. The overall equalizer is based on a so-called per-tone equalization (PTEQ) [21]. In [20], we have proposed a low-training overhead equalizer for the general case of <b>frequency</b> <b>selective</b> transmitter and receiver IQ imbalance together with CFO and channel distortion for single-input single-output (SISO) systems. However, the proposed scheme cannot decouple the transmitter/receiver IQ imbalance from the channel distortion when there is no CFO.|$|R
