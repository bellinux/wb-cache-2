2500|$|According to John Richardson in a 2007 Vanity Fair article, [...] "Jason Epstein's {{assessment}} of Silvers as 'The most brilliant {{editor of a}} magazine ever to have worked in this country' has been 'shared by virtually {{all of us who}} have been published by Robert Silvers'". The British newspaper [...] The Guardian called Silvers [...] "the greatest literary editor there has ever been", while Library of America remembered him as [...] "an unsurpassed editor who helped define and sustain the literary and intellectual culture of New York and America". The New York Times described him as [...] "the voracious polymath, the obsessive perfectionist, the slightly unknowable bachelor-workaholic with the colossal Rolodexes and faintly British diction", and, in his obituary, stated that [...] "under his editorship [...] became one of the premier intellectual journals in the United States, a showcase for extended, thoughtful essays on literature and politics by eminent writers." [...] Author Louis Begley wrote, [...] "the ideal editor of my – and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> every writer’s – dreams is ... Robert B. Silvers, the editor, brain, and heart of the NYRB. When I write a piece for his magazine, of course I have the immeasurable good luck to be edited by him. [...] There is no experience quite like it. Bob knows everything that's worth knowing, a consequence of his unflagging curiosity." [...] "Bob's edits are scrupulous, comprehensive, and precise. They are frequently aimed at saving the reviewer's face." [...] Roger Cohen wrote, after Silvers' death, [...] "No eye for imprecise thought was ever more discerning; no edit a sharper yet gentler distillation than his. ... He was a stickler for accuracy. The pencil in his hand went {{to the heart of the}} matter." ...|$|E

5000|$|Harold's job allowed Mamie Phipps Clark to live {{what she}} {{considered}} a privileged childhood. Black physicians were rare during that time.

5000|$|The {{character}} in your Fig. 4 has a pattern around each nipple which resembles the long-nose god maskettes. The {{faces of the}} maskettes are of the same outline as that found around each nipple on the pictograph. I first interpreted the two parallel lines above the [...] "face" [...] outline as the red horn. I now feel that they represent the long nose of the long-nosed god in a face-on perspective which the artists could not quite handle. That leaves the nipples for the mouth and tongue, and remember that the little faces stuck out their tongues when manipulated. The stone Big Boy pipe from Spiro had long-nose god maskettes on each ear, and <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> that is what Red Horn also wore on his ears and was the reason he was called He-who-wears-human-heads-as-earrings.|$|E

5000|$|Some {{of those}} same targets of {{criticism}} would later become fierce advocates of neoconservative policies.

We'd be running the country. We {{would not have been}} able to get everybody out and bring everybody home....And the question in my mind is how many additional American casualties is Saddam Hussein worth? And the answer is not that damned many. So, I think we got it right, both when we decided to expel him from Kuwait, but also when the president made the decision that we'd achieved our objectives and we were not going to go get bogged down in the problems of trying to take over and govern Iraq.|$|E

5000|$|... 4,000 members: The Federal {{indictment}} says, [...] "Shadowcrew was {{an international}} organization of approximately 4,000 members…" [...] The last available page before October 27, 2004 on archive.org shows 2,709 registered FOUND. To {{people familiar with}} the ShadowCrew forum, {{it is well known that}} many members had multiple user names. Members who were banned from the forum would frequently register with another user name as well. Lastly, the forum was around for over 2 years so there were likely many inactive accounts. NOTE: Clarification: There were member who had multiple IDs. And certainly member who were kicked would often re-register under another name. BUT, there was also a need by members to develop a name that could be trusted. SO the idea that most the registered user were duplicates isn't accurate.

5000|$|Maude managed Michael Portillo's {{unsuccessful}} {{bid for the}} Conservative {{leadership in}} 2001, after which he declined a front bench role under the new Party Leader Iain Duncan Smith. He {{was considered to be}} a 'moderniser' and on the centre-left of the party, writing in The Daily Telegraph (24 June 2002), he said that the Conservative Party's electoral problems had been caused by its failure to [...] "look and sound like modern Britain". Norman Tebbit's secretary, Beryl Goldsmith, criticised Maude after this, asking:"How many male, white, straight Conservative MPs currently passionately campaigning for the selection of more women, and more men and women from ethnic minorities, would voluntarily relinquish their own seats in order to encourage local associations to follow the policy line they preach from their own smug, safe base? Precious few <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> — including The Hon. Francis Maude."Outside the Shadow Cabinet, Maude founded Conservatives for Change, CChange, becoming its first chairman. CChange was designed to promote the modernisation of the Conservative Party. Around the same point he also founded Policy Exchange.|$|E
5000|$|If Williams had drowned after accidentally {{falling out}} of his boat, his body {{would be the only}} one from 80 such deaths in the lake never to have been found. The head of a private search firm that {{supplemented}} official efforts {{near the end of the}} search offered a possible explanation. [...] "With the wildlife around, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>guess</b> that the alligators have dismembered and have stored the remains in a location that we would not be able to find," [...] he wrote in a report. Early searchers had reported seeing many of them, and some of the officials were willing to accept the possibility. [...] "Everyone knows the lake is full of alligators," [...] said the FFWCC's David Arnette. [...] "You look for other answers: 'Why hasn't the body appeared?'"It was suggested that perhaps Williams' body had become entangled in the beds of dense hydrilla beneath the lake surface, and then found by the alligators later, with turtles and catfish finishing what they had left behind. Denise Williams, who had avoided media attention during the search for her husband, accepted that her husband had died. She arranged for a memorial service for Mike to be held the day after the search ended.|$|E
40|$|Finally, we {{certainly}} have weak priors on how to attribute causes of serial persistence. For instance, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>guessed</b> a different pattern than Kennan suggests for allocating the two large roots and one zero or negative root that he finds. I have no qualms with assuming considerable persis-tence in labor supply disturbances; movements in labor supply should largely reflect movements in permanent income, which should obviously be persistent, or movements in real interest rates, which also appear to exhibit considerable persistence. By contrast, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> anticipate little persistence caused by the dependence of employment demand and supply on past employment. For production workers the evidence suggests small costs of adjustment for labor demand (e. g., Shapiro, 1986). We might anticipate a negative dependence of labor supply on past employment. Leisure today may be a substitute for leisure tomorrow (as modeled in the paper). Similarly, expiration of unemployment benefits could create a negative dependence. Katz (1986) has documented the strong tendency of U. S. firms to recall workers as the time benefits expire. REFERENCE...|$|R

2500|$|He was {{a natural}} draftsman, and through long {{experimentation}} developed a mastery of color and tonality. Many of his works combine these skills. He uses {{a great variety of}} color palettes from nearly monochromatic to highly polychromatic. His works often have a fragile childlike quality to them and are usually on a small scale. He often used geometric forms and grid format compositions as well as letters and numbers, frequently combined with playful figures of animals and people. Some works were completely abstract. Many of his works and their titles reflect his dry humor and varying moods; some express political convictions. They frequently allude to poetry, music and dreams and sometimes include words or musical notation. The later works are distinguished by spidery hieroglyph-like symbols. Rainer Maria Rilke wrote about Klee in 1921, [...] "Even if you hadn’t told me he plays the violin, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> have <b>guessed</b> that on many occasions his drawings were transcriptions of music." ...|$|R
