5|$|The two statues on {{the lawn}} {{in front of the}} National Gallery are the statue of James II by Grinling Gibbons {{to the west of the}} portico, and of one George Washington, a replica of a work by Jean-Antoine Houdon, to the east that was a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Commonwealth of Virginia {{installed}} in 1921.|$|E
5|$|A last-minute gift of £4,000 from Shackleton's cousin William Bell {{still left}} the {{expedition}} {{far short of}} the required £30,000, but enabled Nimrods refit to be finished. Fundraising continued in Australia after the ship arrived there; a further £5,000 was provided as a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Government of Australia, and the New Zealand Government gave £1,000. By these means, and with other smaller loans and donations, the £30,000 was raised, although {{by the end of the}} expedition total costs had risen, by Shackleton's estimate, to £45,000.|$|E
5|$|Alexander's army {{crossed the}} Hellespont in 334BC with {{approximately}} 48,100 soldiers, 6,100 cavalry and {{a fleet of}} 120 ships with crews numbering 38,000, drawn from Macedon and various Greek city-states, mercenaries, and feudally raised soldiers from Thrace, Paionia, and Illyria. He showed his intent to conquer {{the entirety of the}} Persian Empire by throwing a spear into Asian soil and saying he accepted Asia as a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> gods. This also showed Alexander's eagerness to fight, in contrast to his father's preference for diplomacy.|$|E

5|$|Because of the {{difficulty}} and risk of meeting the Huaorani on the ground, the missionaries chose to drop gifts to the Huaorani by fixed-wing aircraft. Their drop technique, developed by Nate Saint, involved flying around the drop location in tight circles while lowering the <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> plane on a rope. This kept the bundle in roughly {{the same position as}} it approached the ground. On October 6, 1955, Saint made the first drop, releasing a small kettle containing buttons and rock salt. The gift-giving continued during the following weeks, with the missionaries dropping machetes, ribbons, clothing, pots, and various trinkets.|$|E
5|$|Jennings {{died of a}} heart attack, {{most likely}} brought on by another bout with jaundice, on July 26, 1834, at his farm near Charlestown. He was fifty years old. Jennings was buried after a brief {{ceremony}} in an unmarked grave. His estate lacked the funds to purchase a headstone. Jennings's creditors, many of whom were his neighbors, were left unpaid and disgruntled. Following Jennings's death, Tipton sold the Jennings farm to Joseph Carr and gave Jennings's widow a $100 <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> proceeds.|$|E
5|$|Oliphant {{followed}} up the work by constructing a particle accelerator that could fire protons {{with up to}} 600,000 electronvolts of energy. He soon confirmed the results of Cockroft and Walton on the artificial disintegration of the nucleus and positive ions. He produced a series of six papers over the following two years. In 1933, the Cavendish Laboratory received a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> American physical chemist Gilbert N. Lewis of {{a few drops of}} heavy water. The accelerator was used to fire heavy hydrogen nuclei (deuterons, which Rutherford called diplons) at various targets. Working with Rutherford and others, Oliphant thereby discovered the nuclei of Helium-3 (helions) and tritium (tritons).|$|E

All proceeds from the auction would go to A Kid Again non-profit organization, formerly known as Adventures for Wish Kids. The first rider auction raised $102,000. The first eight trains, or the first 256 seats were auctioned off. The average bid was $398 per seat.|$|E

Among hundreds of thangkas, two notable paintings of Chakrasamvara and Yamanataka {{date to the}} reign of the Yongle Emperor; both are embroidered on silk and well-preserved. The collection also has 54 boxes of Tripiṭaka printed in red, 108 carved sandalwood boxes with sutras and a vase (a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Qianlong Emperor) used to select the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama.|$|E

5|$|The rate of {{immigration}} from Europe grew steeply after the Civil War, and Manhattan became the first stop for millions seeking {{a new life in}} the United States, a role acknowledged by the dedication of the Statue of Liberty on October 28, 1886, a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> people of France. The new European immigration brought further social upheaval. In a city of tenements packed with poorly paid laborers from dozens of nations, the city was a hotbed of revolution (including anarchists and communists among others), syndicalism, racketeering, and unionization.|$|E
5|$|The site {{is home to}} five {{houses of}} worship for Scouts and other visitors, {{including}} a Buddhist sala, Jewish synagogue, and an Islamic mosque. The Buddhist Sala was donated to Gilwell Park in 1967 by the Boy Scouts of Thailand. The Buddha found inside was a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Thai government and is over 1000 years old. Thai ambassadors to the United Kingdom often visit the sala, as it is their responsibility to care for it.|$|E
5|$|Two huge murals by Brazilian artist Cândido Portinari, {{entitled}} Guerra e Paz (War and Peace) {{are located}} at the delegates hall. The works are a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> United Nations Association of the United States of America and Portinari intended to execute them in the United States. However, he was denied a visa due to his communist convictions and decided to paint them in Rio de Janeiro. They were later assembled in the headquarters. After their completion in 1957, Portinari, who was already ill when he started the masterpiece, succumbed to lead poisoning from the pigments his doctors advised him to abandon.|$|E

5|$|Columbus is a {{historic}} statue in Providence, Rhode Island, United States on Elmwood Avenue in Columbus Square. Columbus is a bronze cast of a sterling silver statue which was created by Rhode Island's Gorham Manufacturing Company for the 1892 Columbian Exposition in Chicago. The original silver statue was not meant for permanent exhibition, {{but rather as a}} demonstration of the skills of the Gorham Company, and was later melted down. The bronze cast was dedicated November 8, 1893 as a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> Elmwood Association to the City of Providence. It stands upon a granite base {{at the center of a}} grassy triangle at the intersection of Reservoir Avenue and Elmwood Avenue. The statue features Christopher Columbus, was created in 1893 by Frédéric Auguste Bartholdi and added to the National Register of Historic Places in 2001.|$|E
5|$|During {{the seventeenth}} century the bonshō was also a symbol of a temple's leadership; {{possession}} of the bell indicated ownership of the associated temple. As a result, bells were often stolen; the folk hero Benkei {{is said to have}} dragged the three-ton bell of Mii-dera temple up Mount Hiei during one such theft. The deep scratches in the Benkei bell, which is still displayed at Mii-dera, are said in the legend {{to be the result of}} Benkei's kicking the bell all the way back to the monastery when he discovered that it would not toll for him. The Benkei bell is also associated with the legendary hero Tawara Tōda, who originally donated it to the Mii-dera temple. He acquired it as a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> dragon deity Ryūjin, after saving the god from a giant centipede.|$|E
5|$|In 1876, Wright {{was elected}} to his old seat in Congress as a Democrat, but {{with support from the}} small Greenback movement. In 1878, the {{situation}} was reversed: Wright ran as a Greenbacker, but was reelected with support by Democrats. He attracted attention in Congress with his proposal to amend the Homestead Act of 1862 to establish government loans to would-be settlers of the West, making it easier for landless Easterners to claim homesteads there. Congress was, on the whole, not receptive to Wright's proposal. Wright proposed it again in 1879 and emphasized the conservatism of his proposal, that it was a loan secured by the homestead, not a <b>gift</b> <b>from</b> <b>the</b> state; even so, the bill went down to overwhelming defeat. Despite his failure, Wright, like Weaver, had raised his profile as a potential presidential nominee by attempting to advance Greenback ideas in Congress.|$|E
