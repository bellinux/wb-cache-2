50|$|<b>Density</b> <b>slicing,</b> a {{variation}} of pseudo color, divides an image into a few colored bands and is (among others) used {{in the analysis of}} remote sensing images. For <b>density</b> <b>slicing</b> the range of grayscale levels is divided into intervals, with each interval assigned to one of a few discrete colors - this is in contrast to pseudo color, which uses a continuous color scale. For example, in a grayscale thermal image the temperature values in the image can be split into bands of 2 °C, and each band represented by one color - as a result the temperature of one spot in the thermograph can be easier acquired by the user, because the discernible differences between the discrete colors are greater than those of images with continuous grayscale or continuous pseudo color.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether leaf area index (LAI) can be accurately estimated in intensively managed pine plantations using multiple-return airborne laser scanner (lidar) data. In situ measurements of LAI were made using the LiCor LAI- 2000 Plant Canopy Analyzer on 109 plots under a variety of stand conditions (i. e., stand age, nutritional regime, and stem density) in North Carolina and Virginia, USA in late summer, 2008. Distributional metrics were calculated for each plot using small footprint lidar data (average pulse density 5 pulses per square meter; up to four returns per pulse) acquired in the month preceding the field measurements. Distributional metrics were calculated for each plot using all vegetation returns, as well as using ten 1 m deep crown <b>density</b> <b>slices</b> (a new technique introduced in this study), five above and five below the mode of the vegetation returns for each plot. These metrics were used as independent variables in best subsets regressions with LAI (measured in situ) as the dependent variable. The best resulting models had an R 2 ranging from 0. 61 (for a 2 -variable model) to 0. 83 (for a 6 -variable model). The laser penetration index (LPI) was an important variable regardless of the number of variables used. Other important variables included the mean intensity value, the mean and 20 th percentile of the vegetation returns, and various crown <b>density</b> <b>slice</b> metrics.
