50|$|Intrauterine tuboperitoneal {{insemination}} (IUTPI) involves {{injection of}} washed sperm into both the uterus and fallopian tubes. The cervix is then clamped to prevent leakage to the vagina, best achieved with {{a specially designed}} <b>double</b> <b>nut</b> bivalve (DNB) speculum. The sperm is mixed to create a volume of 10 ml, sufficient to fill the uterine cavity, pass through the interstitial part of the tubes and the ampulla, finally reaching the peritoneal cavity and the Pouch of Douglas {{where it would be}} mixed with the peritoneal and follicular fluid. IUTPI can be useful in unexplained infertility, mild or moderate male infertility, and mild or moderate endometriosis. In non-tubal sub fertility, fallopian tube sperm perfusion may be the preferred technique over intrauterine insemination.|$|E

50|$|Vallée de Mai Nature Reserve ("May Valley") is {{a nature}} park and UNESCO World Heritage Site {{on the island}} of Praslin, Seychelles. It {{consists}} of a well-preserved palm forest, flagship species made up of the island endemic coco de mer, as well as five other endemic palms. The coco de mer (Lodoicea maldivica), a monocot tree in the Arecaceae (palm family), has the largest seeds (<b>double</b> <b>nut</b> seed) of any plant in the world. Also unique to the park is its wildlife, including birds such as the rare Seychelles black parrot, mammals, crustaceans, snails, and reptiles. There has been a determined effort to eliminate all the introduced exotic species of plants from the area but this has not been successful in eliminating coffee, pineapple, and ornamental palms thus far. This forest, with its primitive plant and animal species, is a relict from the time when the supercontinent of Gondwana was divided into smaller parts, leaving the Seychelles islands between the present day Madagascar and India.|$|E
5000|$|The New Zealand (now Australian) bar has a black wrapper with [...] "Moro" [...] {{written in}} yellow (see side photo). The slogan is [...] "Get more go" [...] {{due to its}} high energy content. This bar has a whipped nougat and caramel centre and is covered in chocolate. There are three {{different}} types of Moro sold in New Zealand, the aforementioned 'standard Moro', the Moro <b>Double</b> <b>Nut</b> containing peanuts and hazelnuts, and the recently released Moro Gold, {{which is similar to}} the Irish Moro and the Boost Bar sold by Cadbury in Australia. It is available in New Zealand, and a very limited number of stores in Australia, although Moro is one of the miniature chocolate bars found in Cadbury Favourites. It is equivalent to the Australian or European Mars Bar, as well as being very close to the Australian Cadbury Whip, however within New Zealand it has eclipsed the Mars Bar, becoming something quintessentially Kiwi as well as Cadbury's best selling bar within New Zealand. It's stated on the fun facts page of the Cadbury New Zealand website that a Moro bar is consumed once every two seconds.|$|E
5000|$|The park is {{the habitat}} for endemic coco-de-mer, which is {{reported}} as the [...] "flagship species of global significance" [...] growing to {{a height of}} 25 - 34 m. It is fan-shaped with leaves 7 - 10 m long and 4.5 m wide, and its petioles (stems) are 4 m long. The tree bears the largest <b>double</b> <b>nut</b> with the largest seed, among the species of the plant biodiversity found in the world; the weight of its largest fruit was 42 kg. This tree {{is made up of}} stilt roots and has its canopy formed by leaves. The roots and the trunk are not easily distinguishable and they bear fruits of round and oval shape. There are five other endemic palm species; millionaire's salad (Deckenia nobilis), thief palm (Phoenicophorium borsigianum), Seychelles stilt palm (Verschaffeltia splendida) latanier millepattes (Nephrosperma vanhoutteanum) and latanier palm (Roscheria melanochaetes). These six species of palms are not only unique to this reserve but also to the Seychelles, and are not found anywhere else in the Indian Ocean in its pristine ancient state of evolution. The forest is dense with Pandanus screw palms and broad leaf trees. Chrysobalanus icaco Cocoplum is also reported. The aesthetic beauty of this natural palm forest is a grand display of an array of green, red and brown palm fronds. Some amount of supplementation has occurred in the plantation of these species of palms with the only intent of maintaining the ecosystem.There are some 4000 palm trees in the park (5,000 is also mentioned of equal number of male and female species). Two other endemic trees in the aprk are Dillena furruginea also known as bwa rouz and Northea hornei or the Kapisen. Takamaka trees are the entrance to the park and when they flower Seychelles sun birds feed on the nectar of the flowers. Shy tenrec have been introduced into the park from Madagascar.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} study, we {{developed}} a new feed correction mechanism which corrected not only a positioning error (i. e., feed deviation) but also an angular error (i. e., yaw of a table). A correction mechanism including two piezoelectric actuators was constructed and installed between <b>double</b> <b>nuts.</b> The correction mechanism corrects positioning error if both piezoelectric actuators are expanded to the same length, and corrects angular error if one piezoelectric actuator is expanded {{and the other is}} contracted. First, the positioning and angular errors correction functions were investigated separately. A load was applied {{to one side of the}} table in order to simulate a counter force during machining. In the positioning error correction, a low-frequency component of positioning error was corrected effectively under the condition that the load for the table was set to at least 50 N. In the angular error correction, the correction capability was comparable to that of the positioning error correction up to the maximum load torque to the table, 1. 4 Nm. The load torque was limited to 1. 4 Nm because both piezoelectric actuators reached their saturation voltage. Finally, simultaneous correction of positioning error and angular error was examined, and the simultaneous correction capability was confirmed to be equivalent to the separate correction capabilities...|$|R
40|$|The {{performance}} of several bridge deck fastening systems is being evaluated on the steel bridge at the Facility for Accelerated Service Testing (FAST) at the Transportation Technology Center, Pueblo, Colorado. Fastening systems tested to date include several variations using hook bolts, {{as well as}} spring clips. Results to date indicate that minor, inexpensive installation details can lead to significant increases in time required between maintenance. Details {{such as the use}} of <b>double</b> <b>nuts</b> and threaded fastener adhesive has proven to be particularly effective. At FAST, more than 500 million gross tons (MGT) of traffic passed over the bridge before tightening was required after this retrofit was applied. Other hardware details, {{such as the use of}} locking clips, can also increase time between maintenance; particularly in high-impact areas near rail joints. Locking clips have proven to extend maintenance cycles at FAST. But, some other hardware variations offered little or no benefit under the heavy axle load (HAL) traffic at FAST. Results for eight different deck fastener combinations are presented in this paper. Advantages and drawbacks, as well as failure modes, are noted based on the test experience at FAST. The bridge deck at FAST is a Conrail open-deck design with dapped oak ties. The deck has carried over 1, 200 MGT of 315, 000 -pound HAL traffic since installation in lat...|$|R
40|$|The {{construction}} of furniture corner joints is often {{carried out by}} assembling <b>double</b> thread (“Trio”) <b>nuts</b> and metal corners. Such connections are particularly suitable for disassemble bal structures and these connections are also used for savings in transport when all the structural elements are transported in boxes and furniture is prepared for in site assembly. The assembly process consists of fastening the binding metal corners to wooden elements with the metric thread screws. To achieve the optimal quality of these joints, the production process must {{comply with the requirements}} of various products including the loading applications and strength of individual wood species. This paper examines the fundamental factors affecting the quality of such joints. Special attention was paid to the process of screwing and loading capacity of <b>double</b> thread <b>nuts</b> in three different types of wood. Optimization of the technological process was set as the ultimate goal aimed at achieving a high level of product quality. Tests have been conducted on fi r, beech and oak wood to determine optimal bore diameters and nut screwing parameters relative to the screwing resistance, extraction force and the time interval required for nut screwing...|$|R

Please report any quality issues you encounter to digital@library. tamu. edu, referencing the URI of the item. Includes bibliographical references. Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. Standards for tightening procedures for large diameter anchor bolts are proposed. These bolts, 38 mm (I 1 / 2 in.) in diameter or greater, are widely used in highway appurtenance. In current practices, the contractor is left to his or her own judgment concerning how tight to tighten the nuts on the anchor bolt system. Recent bolt failures have raised concerns about nut tightening procedures. When the nuts of a <b>double</b> <b>nut</b> system are not tightened sufficiently, fatigue loading, and even impact loading, can cause failure of the bolts. Four full-size test specimens were built to evaluate the <b>double</b> <b>nut</b> connection used for anchorage on cantilever overhead sign structures (COSS) and on high mast illumination poles (HMIP). This thesis details the tightening, static, and fatigue tests performed on the two COSS specimens...|$|E
40|$|An {{adaptive}} precision {{ball screw}} drive concept is presented in which a self-sufficient actuator is able to adjust the axial preload during the operation. The adjustment is effected by thermal shape memory alloy pucks, which either expand or contract according to the surrounding temperature field of the process. For this purpose, no external energy is needed and so the system is self-supported (energy harvesting). In this case, the extrinsic two-way shape memory effect occurs and the reversible full cycle of shape change is accomplished by a bias force of a flexure. Basing on temperature and force measurements on a <b>double</b> <b>nut</b> ball screw, a thermo-mechanical model is developed. Using the investigated principles adaptive mechanisms, a shape memory-based actuator is designed. Initial tests reveal an unwanted reduction of the preload of up to 800 N with rising temperature. Due to the shape memory actuation device, experiments results show an increase in axial load in approximated 70 % of the reduction...|$|E
40|$|Due to {{the high}} {{fracture}} sensitivity even with small lateral loads and bending moments, common piezo stack actuators are not very often applicated {{in the field of}} mechanical engineering. The co-operation of the Fraunhofer-Intitutes IKTS and IWU in the Fraunhofer strategic research project FASPAS has led to the shape composite actuators a new kind of actuators that consists of PZT-hollow fibres or PZT-plates. Acting in the d 31 mode (contraction), the new actuators are especially characterised by tolerating non-axial loads. The cross section of the actuators can be easily adapted to the designed geometry of the mechanical components. Apart from the manufacture process the article explains a phenomenological actuator model, which can be used for describing the stroke dependent upon load of piezo-based components. The adjustable preload of a ball screw drive by means of the new actuators is one example for the advanced structure integration. The application of the shape composite inside of the <b>double</b> <b>nut</b> of a ball screw drive is a robust system with big advantages over former solutions...|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a an {{automated}} bench top electronic penetrometer (ABEP) that allows performing tests with high rate of data acquisition (up to 19, 600 Hz) and with variation of the displacement velocity and of the base area of cone penetration. The mechanical components of the ABEP are: a supporting structure, stepper motor, velocity reducer, <b>double</b> <b>nut</b> ball screw and six penetration probes. The electronic components of ABEP are: a "driver " to control rotation and displacement, power supply, three load cells, two software programs for running and storing data, and a data acquisition module. This penetrometer presented in compact size, portable and in 32 validation tests it proved easy to operate, and showed high resolution, high velocity in reliability in data collection. During the validation tests the equipment met the objectives, because the test results showed that the ABEP could use different sizes of cones, allowed work at different velocities, showed for velocity and displacement, were only 1. 3 % and 0. 7 %, respectively, at the highest velocity (30 mm s- 1) and 1 % and 0. 9 %, respectively for the lowest velocity (0. 1 mm s- 1) ...|$|E
40|$|A {{prototype}} unit of a re-adjustable multiple-dibbler ergonomic tool (RaMdE Tool) {{was designed}} and developed for tray-based seedling production of high value crops. It was locally-fabricated using commonly-used shop tools, equipments and materials available over-the-counter. Parts of the prototype tool are grip handle, shank, tool bar, dibbler teeth, wing nut and hexagonal <b>double</b> <b>nut.</b> Theoretical and effective dibbling time per tray of the prototype tool is significantly different (28. 2 sec.) from the farmers practice (34. 1 sec.). Dibbling Capacity significantly increased to 109 trays/hour from 15. 7 trays/hr (farmers ’ practice) with device efficiency of 82. 7 %. Reduction in dibbling time did not significantly affect dibbling quality. Using RaMdE Tool is a very light physical activity with a mean score of 9. 25 by Borg’s Rating of Perceived Exertion (RPE) Scale. The prototype is “fair ” designed tool (Mean Score: 87. 2) using the Checklists for the Ergonomic Evaluation of Hand Tools. Investment of P 560. 00 for a RaMdE Tool unit yields net benefit of P 1, 008. 80 / growing season.
