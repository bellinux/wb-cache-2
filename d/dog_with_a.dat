5|$|By the 18th century two breeds {{had been}} {{developed}} for hunting hare and rabbit: the Southern Hound and the North Country Beagle (or Northern Hound). The Southern Hound, a tall, heavy <b>dog</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> square head, and long, soft ears, was common from south of the River Trent and probably {{closely related to the}} Talbot Hound. Though slow, it had stamina and an excellent scenting ability. The North Country Beagle, possibly a cross between an offshoot of the Talbot stock and a Greyhound, was bred chiefly in Yorkshire and was common in the northern counties. It was smaller than the Southern Hound, less heavy-set and with a more pointed muzzle. It was faster than its southern counterpart but its scenting abilities were less well developed. As fox hunting became increasingly popular, numbers of both types of hound diminished. The beagle-type dogs were crossed with larger breeds such as Stag Hounds to produce the modern Foxhound. The beagle-size varieties came close to extinction but some farmers in the South ensured the survival of the prototype breeds by maintaining small rabbit-hunting packs.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} long-coated Russian Toy {{is arguably}} a dog named Chikki born on 12 October 1958 to two smooth-coated dogs that both had slightly longer hair than was typical. Initially, the puppy {{was not to}} be registered as its coat was too long meet the breed standard, and usually such dogs would not participate in breeding programs and would often be put down. Chikki, however, was registered with a pedigree and purchased by Evgeniya Fominichna Zharova. Zharova is thus the long-coated variety's founding breeder as the first breeder to intentionally retain and breed a <b>dog</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> longer coat. Chikki developed an ear fringe and was mated with a female named Irma, who also had a longer coat than most smooth-coated dogs, and together they produced a litter of three long-coated puppies. Zharova developed the breed in Moscow, and so it {{came to be known as}} the Moscow Toy Terrier. The breed made its first appearance at a dog show in 1964 and the standard was set in 1966. Ten years after Chikki's birth, between 1968 and 1969, approximately 300 long-coated dogs were registered – a significant number considering that Russian Toy litters tend to be small, typically one to three puppies. Today, the long-coated variety has an established presence in Poland, the Czech Republic, Estonia, the Ukraine and a number of other countries, but the breeding program is particularly strong in Finland.|$|E

40|$|OBJECTIVES: To characterise the {{clinical}} presentation and neurological abnormalities in dogs affected by aortic thromboembolism. METHODS: The medical records of 13 <b>dogs</b> diagnosed <b>with</b> aortic thromboembolism {{as the cause of}} {{the clinical}} signs, and where a complete neurological examination was performed, were reviewed retrospectively. RESULTS: The onset was acute in only four dogs, chronic in five <b>dogs</b> (<b>with</b> all of these presenting as exercise intolerance) or chronic with acute deterioration in four <b>dogs.</b> <b>Dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> acute onset of clinical signs were more severely affected exhibiting neurological deficits, while <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chronic onset of disease predominantly presented with the exercise intolerance and minimal deficits. The locomotor deficits included exercise intolerance with pelvic limb weakness (five of 13), pelvic limb ataxia (one of 13), monoparesis (two of 13), paraparesis (two of 13), non-ambulatory paraparesis (two of 13) and paraplegia (one of 13). There was an apparent male predisposition and the cavalier King charles spaniel was overrepresented. CLINICAL SIGNIFICANCE: The rate of onset of clinical signs appears to segregate dogs affected by aortic thromboembolism into two groups, with different clinical characteristics and outcomes. <b>Dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> acute onset of the clinical signs tend to be more severely affected, while <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chronic onset predominantly present with exercise intolerance. It is therefore important to consider aortic thromboembolism as a differential diagnosis in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> acute onset of pelvic limb neurological deficits and in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> longer standing exercise intoleranc...|$|R

25|$|Typhon {{the enemy}} of the Olympian gods is {{described}} as a vast grisly monster with a hundred heads and a hundred serpents issuing from his thighs, who was conquered and cast into Tartarus by Zeus, or confined beneath volcanic regions, where he is the cause of eruptions. Typhon is thus the chthonic figuration of volcanic forces. Serpent elements figure among his offspring; among his children by Echidna are: Cerberus (a monstrous three-headed <b>dog</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> snake for a tail and a serpentine mane); the serpent-tailed Chimaera; the serpent-like chthonic water beast Lernaean Hydra; and the hundred-headed serpentine dragon Ladon. Both the Lernaean Hydra and Ladon were slain by Heracles.|$|E
25|$|Some animals opportunistically {{mate with}} {{individuals}} of another species. This is more commonly observed in domesticated species and animals in captivity, possibly because captivity {{is associated with}} a decrease in aggression and an increase in sexual receptivity. Nevertheless, animals in the wild have been observed to attempt sexual activity with other species. It is mostly documented among species that belong to the same genus, but sometimes occurs between species of distant taxa. Alfred Kinsey cites reports of sexual activity involving a female eland with an ostrich, a male <b>dog</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> chicken, a male monkey with a snake, and a female chimpanzee with a cat.|$|E

This breed represents perhaps the greatest divergence between working and show lines of any breed of dog. A field-bred dog and a show-bred dog appear to be different breeds, but are registered together. In fact, the gene pools are almost completely segregated and have been for at least 70 years.

40|$|Abstract This paper {{describes}} {{the use of}} a validated quality of life assessment tool (described elsewhere) to identify environmental and management factors that may affect quality of life in dogs kennelled in rehoming centres. Dogs were allocated to one of four treatment groups, all of which had a positive (0. 0 - 1. 0) average quality of life score: long stay <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> enriched routine had a mean score of 0. 477; long stay <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> standard routine had a mean score of 0. 453; newly admitted <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>an</b> enriched routine had a mean score of 0. 399; and newly admitted <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> standard routine had a mean score of 0. 362. Only 2 of the dogs had a negative score (- 1. 0 - 0. 0). Thirteen rehoming centre managers completed a questionnaire relating to the kennel environment and management practices of their rehoming centres. The environmental and management factorsâ�� associations with quality of life scores, collected from 202 dogs from the 13 rehoming centres using this scoring system, were analysed as fixed factors in a linear mixed-effect model, with rehoming centre fitted as a random factor, and a multiple linear regression model. There was a statistically significant association between quality of life scores and rehoming centre (H(12) |$|R
40|$|Hepatic {{encephalopathy}} (HE) is {{an important}} cause {{of morbidity and mortality}} in patients with liver disease. The pathogenesis of he is incompletely understood although ammonia and inflammatory cytokines have been implicated as key mediators. To facilitate further mechanistic understanding of the pathogenesis of HE, a large number of animal models have been developed which often involve the surgical creation of an anastomosis between the hepatic portal vein and the caudal vena cava. One of the most common congenital abnormalities in dogs is a congenital portosystemic shunt (cpss), which closely mimics these surgical experimental models of HE. <b>Dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cPSS often have clinical signs which mimic clinical signs observed in humans with HE. Our hypothesis is that the pathogenesis of HE in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cPSS is similar to humans with HE. The aim {{of the study was to}} measure a range of clinical, haematological and biochemical parameters, which have been linked to the development of HE in humans, in <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cPSS and a known HE grade. One hundred and twenty <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> <b>a</b> cPSS were included in the study and multiple regression analysis of clinical, haematological and biochemical variables revealed that plasma ammonia concentrations and systemic inflammatory response syndrome scores predicted the presence of HE. Our findings further support the notion that the pathogenesis of canine and human HE share many similarities and indicate that <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> cPSS may be an informative spontaneous model of human HE. Further investigations on <b>dogs</b> <b>with</b> cPS...|$|R

The tail of the working Spinone is customarily docked at half its length (approx 5.5 to 8inches or 140 to 200mm {{from the base of the}} tail). Non-working UK based Italian Spinones are no longer docked, in accordance with current legislation.
