40|$|AbstractIn in {{the last}} 10 - 15 years, {{droughts}} in Banat Plain have imposed finding new sources of water for irrigation application on drained land. This paper presents irrigation facilities on 400 hectares on a private area using modern sprinkler irrigation installations, with Bega River being the water source. The installations use modern mobile watering devices: centred pivots and <b>hose</b> - <b>drum</b> irrigation, longitudinally propelled. The water intake for the irrigation application is taken from Bega River and transported over a distance of 12. 9 km through the existing network of drainage channels, accumulated in a storage pool from which it is pumped in the underground through a network of pipes and distributed to the crops by mobile sprinkler irrigation equipment. Thereby this sprinkler irrigation facility is using the existing drainage network to transport water from the source to landscaped area. The numeric modelling was performed using MIKE 11 by DHI software, HD module. The Hydrodynamic (HD) module is {{the nucleus of the}} MIKE 11 modelling system and forms the basis for most of the modules including Flood Forecasting, Advection-Dispersion, Water Quality and Non-cohesive sediment transport modules [1]...|$|R

5000|$|Valiant tankers {{were flown}} by No. 214 Squadron at RAF Marham, {{operational}} in 1958, and 90 Squadron at Honington, operational in 1959. Aircraft {{assigned to the}} tanker role were fitted with a <b>Hose</b> <b>Drum</b> Unit (HDU or [...] "HooDoo") in the bomb bay. The HDU was mounted on bomb-mounting points and could be removed if necessary; this arrangement meant that the bomb bay doors had to be opened {{in order to give}} fuel to a receiver aircraft. A control panel at the radar navigator station in the cockpit was used to operate the HDU. All of the HDU equipment was designed to be easily removable so that the aircraft could be reverted to the bomber role.|$|E

50|$|In 1977, studies began into {{converting}} redundant commercial VC10s into aerial refuelling tankers; the RAF subsequently {{issued a}} contract to British Aerospace to convert five former BOAC VC10s and four former East African Airways Super VC10s, designated VC10 K2 and VC10 K3 respectively. During conversion, extra fuel tanks were installed in the former passenger cabin; these increased the theoretical maximum fuel load to 85 tons/77 tonnes (K2) and 90 tons/82 tonnes (K3), the Super VC10's fin fuel tank making the difference. In practice, the fuel load was capped by the maximum take-off weight before the tanks were full. Both variants featured a pair of wing-mounted refuelling pods and a single centreline refuelling point, known as a <b>Hose</b> <b>Drum</b> Unit (HDU), installed in the rear freight bay; nose-mounted refuelling probes were also fitted.|$|E

5000|$|A {{total of}} 108 Valiants would be manufactured, {{including}} the sole B.2 prototype. In {{addition to their}} principal role as the RAF's delivery platform for Britain's nuclear deterrent, the Valiant was capable of performing, or was otherwise adapted to perform, in other capacities; these included conventional bombing, aerial reconnaissance, aerial refuelling tanker, and electronic countermeasures. [...] Valiants of 90 and 214 squadrons were used for air refuelling through {{the addition of a}} <b>Hose</b> <b>Drum</b> Unit (HDU) in the bomb bay, mounted on the same suspension units that were also used for bombs. This meant that for refuelling, the bomb-bay doors had to be opened so that the refuelling hose could be streamed (unlike later tankers where the HDU was flush with the under fuselage rather than inside a bomb bay). Several Valiants were also used for testing and development purposes, such as its use as a flying testbed during trials of the Blue Steel nuclear-armed standoff missile, which was later added to the arsenal of munitions equipped upon the other V-Bombers.|$|E
