25|$|The {{question}} of A's beliefs is no different. If A honestly believes that B {{is only slightly}} injured and so could move himself out of danger without difficulty, how fair is <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> {{he ought to have}} foreseen? The test is what the reasonable person would have known and foreseen, given what A had done. It is the function of any court to evaluate behaviour. A defendant cannot evade responsibility through a form of wilful blindness. Fault lies not only in what a person actually believes, but also in failing to understand what the vast majority of other people would have understood. Hence, the test is hybrid, looking both at what the defendant actually knew and foresaw (i.e. subjective), and at what the reasonable person would have known (i.e. objective) and then combining the conclusions into a general evaluation of the degree of fault or blameworthiness.|$|E

Rick Anderson of AllMusic noted that on [...] "Scissors", Taylor [...] "actually sounds like he's about to burst into tears.

500|$|Later critics {{believed}} {{that it is possible}} that Richardson's work failed because the story deals with a [...] "good man" [...] instead of a [...] "rake", which prompted Richardson's biographers Thomas Eaves and Ben Kimpel to claim, this [...] "might account for the rather uneasy relationship between the story of the novel and the character of its hero, who is never credible in his double love – or in any love." [...] Flynn agrees that this possibility is an [...] "attractive one", and conditions <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> [...] "it is at least certain that the deadly weighted character of Sir Charles stifles the dramatic action of the book." [...] John Mullan suggests that the problem stems from Grandison's role as a hero when he says, [...] "his hero is able to display his virtue in action; as a consequence, Sir Charles Grandison presents its protagonist without the minutely analyzed reflexes of emotion that brought his heroines to life." ...|$|E

2500|$|The {{court in}} McCulloch v.

[...] At the same time, the court retained the power of judicial review established in Marbury v. Madison, declaring that it {{had the power to}} strike down laws that departed from those powers: [...] "Should Congress, in the execution of its powers, adopt measures which are prohibited by the Constitution, or should Congress, under the pretext of executing its powers, pass laws for the accomplishment of objects not intrusted to the Government, it would become the painful duty of this tribunal, [...] should a case requiring such a decision come before <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>that</b> such an act was not the law of the land." ...|$|E

Daimler contracted Dr Frederick Lanchester as their consultant for the purpose and a major re-design and refinement of Knight's design took place in great secrecy. Knight's design was made a practical proposition. When unveiled in September 1908 the new engine caused a sensation.

2500|$|Fattouma Khefacha, {{was born}} in 1861 to Khadouja Mzali and Ahmed Khefacha. When she was very young, her parents divorced. Bourguiba, who had always criticized {{repudiation}} in Islam, stated in 1973, that the reason of the divorce was [...] "futile". Indeed, the divorce took place because Khadouja presented a cold meal to her husband. Once separated, Ahmed married another woman and founded a new family. Khadouja then, {{had no choice but}} to get back to her parent's place, in the [...] "Tripolitanian quarter". It was in that house that Fattouma was raised, her mother refusing to remarry. In 1880, at the age of 15 or 16 years old, Fattouma married Ali Bourguiba, and upon the instance of her mother, wedded in her father's house, before parting for that of her groom. Khadouja, whose father died in 1884, moved into her daughter's house where they cohabited. Therefore, she helped with house chores, participating in supplies preparations and wool washing, at the seaside. She had a good relationship with her sister, Aïchoucha Mzali, mother of the famous Abelaziz al-Aroui, who lived at the end of the same street. Despite that, Bourguiba stated that [...] "in reality, there wasn't much of a relationship between my family and that of mother, that <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>say,</b> <b>that</b> of Ahmed Khefacha, who, as I said, had remarried. However, one day, when going across a nearby square, known today as independence square, where there had been a grand café, my father, who held my hand, told me to go kiss my grandfather, while designating a ruddy faced old man. So I did what I was told and kissed him".|$|E

This depends on how we define the concept "real". By taking a close look at embodied action, and at Metzinger's concept of embodiment, I want to argue that, on a non-Cartesian concept of reality, the self should be considered something real, and not simply an illusion. 1...|$|R
