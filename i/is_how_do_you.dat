5000|$|As with 1980's Ace of Spades, {{recording}} commenced with producer Vic Maile at his Jackson's Studio in Rickmansworth in 1981. Motorhead {{was enjoying}} their greatest commercial {{success at the}} time, having had their live album No Sleep 'til Hammersmith debut at #1 on the U.K. charts. A break in recording for the band to play some November and December dates with Tank was followed by Clarke producing Tank's debut album with help from Will Reid Dick. Soon after, Maile left the Motörhead project, and there are conflicting explanations as to why. One is that Clarke was unhappy with the Maile produced sessions and decided that the album should be recorded themselves, although Lemmy lamented at the time that: [...] "..it's a shame to have lost Vic in a way because I thought it was successful.." [...] However, in the Motörhead documentary The Guts and the Glory, Clarke insists that drummer Phil [...] "Philthy Animal" [...] Taylor refused {{to work with the}} producer after Maile got him an unsatisfactory drum sound, stating: [...] "..and then one day Phil turned to me and said, 'Listen Eddie, why don't you do it?' And I said, 'Man, I don't wanna do it, I'm playing on the record'...I swear to God, I was reluctant as fuck.." [...] In the same film Lemmy states: [...] "..I was pissed off 'cause we let Eddie produce it. I wasn't at the time, though. Fair play. But it became obvious after it was released - I sort of sobered up and realized it was garbage, most of it. And there's at least three songs on there that weren't even finished. We just finished them in the studio, you know, like cobbled it together. It just was a substandard album. But the trouble <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> follow a live album that went straight in at #1? There's nothing you can do.." [...] The album was recorded during the best part of late January and February 1982 at Morgan Studios and Ramport Studios in London, with Clarke producing and Dick engineering. Struggling to think of a name for the title track for the album, Lemmy remembered the time the band had performed live under the name Iron Fist and the Hordes from Hell for contractual reasons (a subsequent album What's Words Worth? was released of that event), and decided this was an apt name for this project. The name was eventually shortened to simply Iron Fist. [...] The title track would go on {{to be one of the}} band's signature songs.|$|E

40|$|There {{are many}} cases where {{people do not}} want or cannot deploy an infrastructure-based network, e. g. using PDAs to {{distribution}} documents in a conference, network for battlefield soldiers, etc. Wireless ad-hoc networks are needed in these cases. With wireless ad-hoc networks, users can get connected with each other, anytime, anywhere. Along with this convenience, users should also be aware that wireless ad-hoc networks, without the support from infrastructure, are weak against adversaries 2 ̆ 7 attacks. The security problems that were previously dealt with in traditional networks, now have to be addressed again. This thesis aims to provide a secure communication channel for wireless ad-hoc networks users. This can be achieved by providing two fundamental cryptographic schemes: Encryption/Decryption and Digital Signature. By encrypting the content of communication, users can assure that even the communication is eavesdropped by adversaries, they can not obtain any information. The challenge <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> setup the required encryption/decryption keys for each user efficiently, where there is no support from infrastructure. We provide a solution in this thesis. On the other hand, digital signatures provide a way for users to authenticate others within the network. When a suspicious user wants to join the network group, decision can be made if he can not provide a valid signature. These schemes provided in this thesis, give wireless ad-hoc network users a secure communication environment...|$|E

40|$|During {{the last}} decade the {{research}} on sensors have exploded. Starting from sensors with only few hours of life time until today they have evolved to small wireless ones, with many years of life time. Introducing wireless communication capabilities to sensor nodes has added a lot of challenges. Shrinking size of the sensor requires transceivers to be extremely small. Even with small radio devices transmitting data over wireless medium is energy consuming. To prolong the life time of the sensor many {{attempts have been made}} to minimize energy usage of transceivers. A successful approach is to duty-cycle transceivers. The radio device is shut down during the period that no transmissions are ongoing. However active transceivers that can wake-up on the transmission have not been developed yet. Therefore a lot of research has been focused on the MAC protocol for wireless sensor network, WSN. With an ideal MAC protocol the transceiver should only be on when there is an ongoing transmission. Nevertheless this is an ideal scenario and due to medium unreliability, synchronization issues and distributed nature of WSN is not possible yet. Researchers have developed a lot of MAC protocols and many of them are mostly applicable for specific scenarios, others are more general. The variety of the MAC protocols poses a challenge for the developer of the applications for WSN. The developers have to analyze the protocols and make a decision on which one to choose. This is not a simple task because the MAC protocol can be available in pseudo code format, written in C/C++ or other language. The creator of the protocol may have optimized code making it hard to read and most importantly to compare to other MAC protocols. The test scenario may be slightly different from the developers setup. The question addressed in this Master Thesis <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> choose the proper MAC protocol? In this thesis we work on developing a formal method for describing the MAC protocol. Using components we can describe and analyze the MAC protocol in a simple way. We can compare the desired metrics such as delay and energy consumption of different protocols. The positive side effect is that components can be reused in different MAC protocols therefore allowing rapid development of new protocols and optimize existing ones for the specific situation.

40|$|This will be {{a seminar}} that {{examines}} Constructivist theory {{as it applies to}} our thinking about instruction. Many folks think of constructivism as a method of instruction [...] it is not. It is a framework for thinking about learning or what it means to come to know. As such, it is a framework for understanding (interpreting) any learning environment as well as a framework for designing instruction. The seminar will be organized around weekly readings. We will examine the alternative constructivist theories, e. g., socio-cultural constructivism and cognitive constructivism, and the pragmatism of Richard Rorty. However, rather than focusing on the differences between these frameworks, our emphasis will be on the implications of the broader, common framework for the design of instruction. Hence we will spend most of the semester discussing strategies for designing and delivering instruction, e. g., the work of Bransford, Collins, Pea, Jonassen, Spiro, Fosnot, Senge, and Schank. We will consider both business and schooling environments for learning [...] there is significant work in both domains. There will be particular emphasis of the use of technology in instruction. We will look at the communication, information, and context providing roles of technology as contrasted to the traditional approach of using technology to deliver instruction (to teach). We will also pay particular attention to problem based learning as one instructional model. In PBL there is particular emphasis {{on the role of the}} facilitator as a learning coach (process orientation) as opposed to a content provider. There is also a particular emphasis on supporting the development of abductive reasoning skills so that the learner develops the ability to be an effective problem solver in the content domain. The major paper/project for the course will be the design of instruction to train individuals to be learning coaches in a problem based learning or goal based scenario learning environment. That <b>is,</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> support teachers in adapting the role of learning coach (which, of course, requires us to understand what it means to be a learning coach). Design teams will be formed with the teams all working on this same design problem. A comprehensive prototype of the learning environment is required as well as a paper provide the theoretical framework and rationale for the design strategy. While not required, I would expect that computer technology will play a significant role in the design of your learning environment. With that in mind, let me note that it is not required that the prototype be delivered on the computer, i. e., I am not requiring programming skills but rather design skills and so “storyboards” is all that is required. ...|$|E
40|$|Funding farm {{services}} Cue: Setting up {{a successful}} business {{can be tricky}} {{at the best of}} times. But in Sudan it is especially difficult. In southern Sudan, many people have now returned to their villages from refugee camps, where they have survived on food aid. But now, back home, many are returning to a very basic subsistence farming which produces no extra income and little security in the face of crop failure. One group which is trying to help in these challenging situations is the Savannah Farmers? Cooperative. The organisation offers training in improved farming methods and has also started an unusual microfinance programme for its farmer members. Managing Director, Zamba Duku, explained more to Pius Sawa. IN:	?The organisation, Savannah Farmers? Cooperative ? OUT:	? think women are adequately covered. ? DUR?N:	 4 ? 15 ? BACK ANNOUNCEMENT: Zamba Duku, Managing Director of the Savannah Farmers? Cooperative in southern Sudan. The interview comes from a resource pack produced by CTA. Transcript Duku	The organisation, Savannah Farmers? Cooperative began in 2001. It started as a kind of charitable organisation to support farmers, but to support farmers not by giving relief or anything free, but by making available tractors to farmers, so that these farmers can use them at a very subsidised cost. It is only in the second season of last year that we began to look at giving the farmers services, and then they pay later, and that is where the microfinance component came in. Sawa	Maybe you can describe this microfinance component; how does it help farmers? Duku	It helps farmers a lot in that a farmer gets his land ploughed very quickly using the tractor. The farmer is given seeds which he or she may not have and the farmer is also given further assistance in weeding, if he or she cannot manage. But we don?t give the money to the farmer, we ask the farmer to get somebody to clean the land, and then we come and pay. Sawa	And how many farmers are you dealing with? Duku	On a pilot basis we have now 320 farmers. Sawa	This sounds like a unique programme. Duku	It?s unique {{in the sense that we}} do not give direct cash to the clients, we give them services which are valued, and then they will pay for the services at the end of harvest, after they have sold their crop. In most microfinance programmes, the beneficiary or the client is given actual cash, and also the client is expected to belong to a small group so that that group can act as a kind of collateral. But in our case here we take each farmer on his or her own merit. Sawa	And what types of crops are they growing? Duku	We signed an agreement with a certain Indian company to grow some Indian crop, and this is green gram, and that is what we are supporting them to grow. Sawa	Apart from green gram how do they produce food for survival? Duku	Actually we require that each farmer who is our beneficiary has two acres set aside for this crop, and then that farmer can grow any other number of acres for his other crops. Food production is not interrupted. Sawa	And I?m trying to look at how a farmer can be able to recover this loan, in what period and how do you recover it? Duku	Actually we expect to recover the money spent in one season at the end of that season. Sawa	Are you partnering with any microfinance institution? Duku	Not as such but we are actually being treated as a kind of unique microfinance institution by the World Bank, which is interested in our model and has given us some money. Sawa	How much money have you got so far? Duku	They have given us US$ 100, 000, with the promise that if we manage this one successfully, they will give us even up to $ 400, 000 in the coming year. Sawa	How does the World Bank have the guarantee that they will not lose their money? Duku	There is no guarantee as such. We only hope that the weather will be good and that the crop will not fail. This is the major thing. But they insist that if there are any losses then we will share the cost, the losses, with them. Sawa	What about the farmers, do they have any risks of them incurring when they don?t recover the loans? Duku	Absolutely not. If the farmers have failed because of climatic conditions, there is no way that we can penalise them. Sawa	How are you trying to successfully engage them into farming through this microfinance institution? Duku	What we are trying to do is entice them with the prospect of earning money for themselves, because this is a major thing for them, a major concern <b>is</b> <b>how</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> get money. Sawa	And we see that women have been having a problem of acquiring microfinance credits or loans. So how are you managing to bring women on board, because most of them don?t own land? Duku	Actually ours is not for women or for men as such, because we are targeting family units, and every family unit will include women and men, so our support goes to families rather than to individuals as such, and in that way I think women are adequately covered.
