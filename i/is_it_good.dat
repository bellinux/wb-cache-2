500|$|The three DVD volumes {{released}} by Media Blasters were also reviewed by Mania.com. In {{the review of}} the first DVD, the reviewer Chris Beveridge described the anime as [...] "something different from the norm" [...] which [...] "mixes romance and comedy quite well". However, the pacing early on is felt as being [...] "awkward" [...] which [...] "takes time to really find its rhythm". For the second DVD volume, Beveridge commented that [...] "the mixing of the relationships continues to be the most interesting part of the show." [...] Beveridge goes on to state [...] "the mild moments of it are tacky and bad," [...] but [...] "when it comes to the core cast of characters, it's all solid material that is very enjoyable." [...] Finally, for the third volume, Beveridge wrote that [...] "despite the issues with how the series turns in the bonus OVA episode, Kashimashi has proven to be quite a lot of fun for the situations it presented." [...] The series is seen to [...] "close out rather well," [...] and [...] "not only <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>good</b> fun but it's also an enjoyable romantic show with lots of heart and emotion." ...|$|E

2500|$|Lopez-Alegria later {{stated that}} he was skeptical of private {{tourists}} a few years ago, but now believes {{it is essential to}} the survival of the Russian space program which is important to the U.S. space program: [...] "If that's the correct solution... then not only <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>good</b> from the standpoint of supporting the Russian space program, but it's good for us as well," [...] he said. Ansari's presence in space [...] "is a great dream and a great hope not just for our country but for countries all around the world." ...|$|E

2500|$|The Israeli Forum for the Promotion of Equal Share in the Burden {{threatened}} {{to boycott the}} fashion chain Fox if they hired Refaeli. The two sides reached a compromise in which Refaeli agreed to visit injured IDF soldiers whenever she is in Israel, and actively encourage enlistment in the army. Refaeli later said, [...] "I don't regret not enlisting, because it paid off big time. That's {{just the way it}} is: celebrities have other needs. I hope my case has influenced the army." [...] She also said: [...] "Israel or Uganda, what difference does it make? It makes no difference to me. Why <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>good</b> to die for our country? What, isn't it better to live in New York? Why should 18-year-old kids have to die? It's dumb that people have to die so that I can live in Israel." ...|$|E

60|$|He {{looked at}} her in mild reproach, a good-humoured smile at the corner of his lips; yet after all <b>was</b> <b>it</b> <b>good</b> humour or some curious outward {{reflection}} of the working of his secret thoughts? When he spoke the reproach, at any rate, was manifest.|$|R

6000|$|The man laughed pleasantly. [...] "That's all right, but I can do {{a little}} in the place I belong to, and the change is {{beginning}} there. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>good</b> for this country that one man should get rich feeding his cattle on leagues of prairie where a hundred families could make a living growing wheat?" ...|$|E

6000|$|... "You talk of {{substantial}} good, Tito! Are faithfulness, and love, and sweet grateful memories, no good? Is it no good {{that we should}} keep our silent promises on which others build because they believe in our love and truth? Is it no good that a just life should be justly honoured? Or, <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>good</b> that we should harden our hearts against all the wants and hopes {{of those who have}} depended on us? What good can belong to men who have such souls? To talk cleverly, perhaps, and find soft couches for themselves, and live and die with their base selves as their best companions." ...|$|E
60|$|WE were {{approaching}} Napoleon, Arkansas. So I {{began to think}} about my errand there. Time, noonday; and bright and sunny. This was bad--not best, anyway; for mine was not (preferably) a noonday kind of errand. The more I thought, the more that fact pushed itself upon me--now in one form, now in another. Finally, it took the form of a distinct question: <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>good</b> common sense to do the errand in daytime, when, by a little sacrifice of comfort and inclination, you can have night for it, and no inquisitive eyes around. This settled it. Plain question and plain answer make the shortest road out of most perplexities.|$|E

[...] "By Serapis! so surely as I yet shall sit in the Capitol at Rome, if thou dost thus flout the Lord Antony, I'll have thee scourged to the bones, and the red wine poured upon thy open wounds to heal them! Ah! at length thou drinkest! Why, what <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> <b>good</b> Eudosius? art sick? Surely, then, this wine must be as the water of jealousy of those Jews, that has power to slay the false and strengthen the honest only.

6000|$|... "What {{is there}} for us if we keep on and go away?" [...] she went on. [...] "All the big {{interests}} in our lives will vanish--everything. We shall become specialised people--people overshadowed by a situation. We shall be an elopement, a romance--all our breadth and meaning gone! People will always think of it first when they think of us; all our work and aims will be warped by it and subordinated to it. <b>Is</b> <b>it</b> <b>good</b> enough, dear? Just to specialise.... I think of you. We've got a case, a passionate case, the best of cases, but {{do we want to}} spend all our lives defending it and justifying it? And there's that other life. I know now you care for Margaret--you care more than you think you do. You have said fine things of her. I've watched you about her. Little things have dropped from you. She's given her life for you; she's nothing without you. You feel that to your marrow all the time you are thinking about these things. Oh, I'm not jealous, dear. I love you for loving her. I love you in relation to her. But there it is, an added weight against us, another thing worth saving." ...|$|E

Can it be the severely virtuous Father Clement who advises his child to aim at, or even to think of, the possession of a throne and a bed which cannot become vacant but by an act of crying injustice to the present possessor? Can it be the wise reformer of the church who wishes to rest a scheme, in itself so unjust, upon a foundation so precarious? Since when <b>is</b> <b>it,</b> <b>good</b> father, that the principal libertine has altered his morals so much, to be likely to court in honourable fashion the daughter of a Perth artisan? Two days must have wrought this change; for only that space has passed since he was breaking into my father's house at midnight, with worse mischief in his mind than that of a common robber. And think you that, if Rothsay's heart could dictate so mean a match, he could achieve such a purpose without endangering both his succession and his life, assailed by the Douglas and March at the same time, for what they must receive as an act of injury and insult to both their houses? Oh!
