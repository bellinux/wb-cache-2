40|$|Background and purpose: <b>Industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> {{and sewage}} <b>sludge</b> {{are used as}} {{fertilizer}} since they contain high levels of nutrient. The main pollutant in <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> is heavy metals. In this study an assessment was made {{on the impact of}} <b>industrial</b> wastewater <b>effluent</b> and sewage <b>sludge</b> on accumulation of heavy metals in agricultural soil at Agh ghallah industrial Estate. Materials and methods: In a descriptive-analytic study, 72 samples (sewage <b>sludge,</b> <b>effluent</b> and soil) were collected from the Industrial state. All sampling and tests were performed according to standard methods and concentration of heavy metals was determined using polarography method. To analyze the data, SPSS was used and 95 confidence intervals (P 0. 05). Conclusion: The concentrations of heavy metal were found lower than the maximum allowable level. Therefore, in this area, wastewater and sewage sludge could be used to irrigate agricultural lands and greenspaces in shortage of water, however, environmental regulations should be taken into account. © 2015 Mazandaran University of Medical Sciences.

30|$|Various {{anthropogenic}} {{activities are}} causing disturbances to many ecological systems leading to serious ecological imbalance. This is mainly {{resulting from the}} {{contamination of the environment}} with toxic heavy metals and metalloids. The microbes surviving in the contaminated sites naturally adapt themselves and such habitats act as potential reservoirs for the competent microorganisms (Ghosh et al. 2008). Bacteria which are exposed to metals and metalloid pollutants in the environment demonstrate a significant resistance towards metal stress by different mechanisms (Dhanjal and Cameotra 2010). Selenium, a metalloid stands at a special position by being an essential trace nutrient at low levels and a toxin at higher concentrations both for the humans and animals. The major sources for the toxic species of selenium: selenate (Se 6 +), selenite (Se 4 +), and selenide (Se 2 −) are <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents,</b> sewage <b>sludges,</b> and agricultural drainage (Ghosh et al. 2008; Husen and Siddiqi 2014). The bacterial reduction of selenium oxyanions such as selenite to elemental selenium {{is one of the major}} biogeochemical processes involved in selenium removal from the agricultural drainage water and sediments. Thus, the bacteria play a key role in the biogeochemical cycling of selenium (Bajaj et al. 2012).|$|R
40|$|Vegetables are an {{inevitable}} and {{important part of}} a healthy and balanced diet. They could be contaminated by heavy metals in many ways including irrigation by sewage water and <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> sewage <b>sludge,</b> vehicular emissions, industrial waste and atmospheric deposition. In this study, we sought to determine if some vegetables (cucumbers, tomatoes, cabbage, lettuce, potatoes, onions, carrots, persian leeks, dill, spinach, coriander, parsley) grown locally in the suburban of Isfahan city and sold in the urban markets are contaminated with cadmium (Cd), chromium (Cr) and lead (Pb). Vegetables were sampled from August to October 2010. After washing, they were oven-dried and digested using three-acid mixture (70 % HNO 3, 65 % HClO 4 and 70 % H 2 SO 4). Analyzes of the heavy metals was performed using atomic absorption spectrophotometry. To validate the assay method, intra-day and inter-day variation studies were performed. The concentrations (µg/g) of heavy metals in the samples ranged from 0. 00 to 3. 66 for Cd, 0. 00 to 6. 00 for Cr and 0. 00 to 7. 14 for Pb. The highest concentration of heavy metals was for Pb. The {{results showed that the}} amount of Cd, Cr and Pb of some samples exceeded the recommended levels. The amount of Cd in cucumber, tomatoes, potatoes with skin, carrots, and spinach was significantly higher in the samples collected from Isfahanak, Dashti and Ilchi farms than those of Dorche farms.

40|$|Liquid digested {{sewage sludge}} from a Chicago waste {{treatment}} plant {{was applied to}} experimental corn plots starting in 1968. The treatment plant received {{a high proportion of}} <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> and the <b>sludge</b> averaged about 200 ppm Cd (dry weight). Corn grain harvested from the plots in 1974 was fed to growing swine for 56 days, and other swine were permitted to forage on the plots during the winters of 1975 - 76 and 1976 - 77. The sludge-fertilized corn contained higher concentrations of nutrient and toxic elements, but did not interfere with swine performance. Minor changes in hepatic microsomal oxidases and red blood cells accompanied significant increases in renal Cd and decreases in hepatic Fe. Swine foraging on these plots ingested considerable amounts of sludge soil and accumulated significantly higher concentrations of renal Cd. At lower rates of sludge application the swine outperformed those foraging both on control plots and those receiving heavy sludge applications in terms of weight gain, in-utero piglet survival, blood hemoglobin, and tissue Fe concentrations...|$|R
30|$|Kaolinite and {{smectite}} {{are found}} {{as a common}} constituent of soils and sediments. When different types of pollutants in domestic sewage, <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents,</b> <b>sludge</b> and other solid wastes are dumped on the earth surface, the soil particles including Kaolinite and smectite minerals can interact with the pollutants. The Kaolinite and smectite minerals in soil may therefore {{play a role in}} scavenging pollutants from the environment. Kaolinite and smectite have a low CEC of the order of 3 – 20  meq/ 100  g, and therefore it is not expected to be an ion exchanger of high order. Thus, Kaolinite and smectite mineral can be a potential adsorbent owing to its low cost, rich natural abundance, and high mechanical and chemical stability. Consequently, Kaolinite and smectite mineral should exhibit significant potential for use in the adsorption and separation of heavy metals. Yet few studies have investigated the suitability of acid-treated clay minerals for heavy metals capture or their adsorption mechanism. The small number of exchange sites is located on the surface of kaolinite and it has no interlayer exchange site. Nevertheless, the small CEC and the adsorption properties may play an effective role in scavenging inorganic and organic pollutants from water. Lead can damage central nervous system and reproductive system, kidney, liver, basic cellular processes and brain functions. It causes many toxic symptoms such as anemia, insomnia, headache, dizziness, irritability, weakness of muscles hallucination and renal damages (Fathy et al. 2016 b). Different tools can be used for the management of wastewater. The removal of these metals from industrial wastewaters has recently become more profound with increasing industrial activities. There are many high-frequency techniques which can be used to remove heavy metal ions as chemical precipitation, ion exchange, evaporation and solvent extraction. Reverse osmosis, ultra-filtration, and micro-filtration process are considered as less frequently used methods. A mixture of diverse methods may be applied to improve the overall decontamination factor, but the best one is ion exchange technique because it is simple and can be regenerated to get back the metal ions again to benefit from them in various fields. This study depends on clay as natural materials because they are environmentally friendly as well as cheap and available in order to achieve the principle of sustainable development and reduce the emissions that cause the phenomenon of climate change threatening life on the planet (Farrag et al. 2016 a). Clays were classified according to their crystal structure and the amount and locations of electric charge (deficit or excess) per unit cell into crystalline clays range from kaolin, which are relatively uniform in chemical composition, to smectite, which vary in their composition, cation exchange properties, and ability to expand. Kaolin is composing of alumino-silicates in nature arranged in an open box crystal structure which is occupied by cations and water molecules. Ionic exchange and reversible rehydration happened between these ions and water molecules in large cavities (Farrag et al. 2016 b).|$|R

The <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> currently going to about half of the 27 outfalls under consideration would be rerouted to LANL`s sanitary sewer system. <b>Industrial</b> <b>effluent</b> from other outfalls would be eliminated by replacing once-through cooling water systems with recirculation systems, or, in a few instances, operational changes would result in no generation of <b>industrial</b> <b>effluent.</b> After the <b>industrial</b> <b>effluents</b> have been discontinued, the affected outfalls would be removed from the NPDES Permit.
