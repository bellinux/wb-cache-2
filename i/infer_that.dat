However it is {{currently}} considered that they {{took part in the}} battle, as suggested by the royalist battle report and a later report from San Martin which clarifies that only twelve grenadiers stayed in the convent.|$|E
5|$|The Andromeda Galaxy has a {{total of}} 15 {{satellite}} galaxies, including M32 and M110. Nine of these lie in a plane, which has caused astronomers to <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> they have a common origin. These satellite galaxies, like the satellites of the Milky Way, tend to be older, gas-poor dwarf elliptical and dwarf spheroidal galaxies.|$|E
5|$|The {{first half}} of the story takes place {{primarily}} at Hikarizaka Private High School, a fictional school located in Japan. Outside of the school, frequented locations include the bakery run by Nagisa's parents, and the dormitory where Youhei Sunohara lives. Throughout the story, glimpses into an Illusionary World are shown. This world is devoid of all life except for a young girl, though she later makes a body out of junk pieces through which the player can interact with her. The remaining half of the story takes place in the same city, after the conclusion of the first half. While the town's name was never directly mentioned, one can <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> the town's name is Hikarizaka based on the many companies and establishments that share this name.|$|E

5|$|The {{inner and}} outer walls were {{constructed}} similarly with the outer wall measuring nine feet high and 18 inches thick, which was also coated in plaster. The outer wall {{is believed to have}} been constructed during the fifteenth century. The construction of the inner wall has been attributed to the Portuguese presence along the coast in the sixteenth century, whilst the presence of gun ports has been used to <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> the walls were not constructed earlier. However, the practicality of the walls as defensive fortification is unclear, since according to Kirkman the walls and gates surrounding the town have no significant strength, which seems to conform to a proposal that the walls and the layout of buildings were used to maintain social barriers. Although the inner wall has a more obvious defensive function and despite the absence of gun ports and the questionable strength of the outer wall, it has nonetheless been credited as being a fortification.|$|E
5|$|The rocks {{collected}} from the Moon are extremely old compared to rocks found on Earth, as measured by radiometric dating techniques. They {{range in age from}} about 3.2 billion years for the basaltic samples derived from the lunar maria, to about 4.6 billion years for samples derived from the highlands crust. As such, they represent samples from a very early period {{in the development of the}} Solar System, that are largely absent on Earth. One important rock found during the Apollo Program is dubbed the Genesis Rock, retrieved by astronauts David Scott and James Irwin during the Apollo 15 mission. This anorthosite rock is composed almost exclusively of the calcium-rich feldspar mineral anorthite, and is believed to be representative of the highland crust. A geochemical component called KREEP was discovered by Apollo 12, which has no known terrestrial counterpart. KREEP and the anorthositic samples have been used to <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> the outer portion of the Moon was once completely molten (see lunar magma ocean).|$|E
25|$|For example, if {{a person}} hears an {{explosion}} and sees a tree fall down that person is likely to <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> the explosion caused the tree to fall over. However, if the explosion occurs after the tree falls down (that is, the first requirement is not met), or rather than an explosion, the person hears the ring of a telephone (that is, the second requirement is not met), then that person {{is not likely to}} <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> either noise caused the tree to fall down.|$|E

25|$|Although {{he seems}} to have started an {{unfinished}} tomb at Abydos (Upper Egypt), Djoser was eventually buried in his famous pyramid at Saqqara in Lower Egypt. Since Khasekhemwy, a pharaoh from the 2nd dynasty, was the last pharaoh to be buried at Abydos, some Egyptologists <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> the shift to a more northerly capital was completed during Djoser's time.|$|E
25|$|Based on this, and Hannibal’s oath, {{some historians}} <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> Hamilcar’s post-Mercenary War {{activities}} {{were aimed at}} eventual war with Rome, which was inherited by his sons, and some further suggested that Hamilcar devised the strategy of invading Italy by crossing the Alps as well as Hannibal’s battle tactics. Without Punic records to cross reference, these remain mere supposition.|$|E
25|$|This econometric {{find was}} the result of Wassily W. Leontief's attempt to test the Heckscher–Ohlin theory empirically. In 1953, Leontief found that the United States—the most capital-abundant country in the world—exported {{commodities}} that were more labor-intensive than capital-intensive, in contradiction with Heckscher–Ohlin theory ("H–O theory"). Leontief used this result to <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> the U.S. should adapt its competitive policy to match its economic realities.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe {{aim of the}} {{research}} is to analyze comparatively learning and studying strategies, and factors affecting locus of control of the students of Buca Education Faculty of Dokuz Eylül University and Education Faculty of Cyprus International University. In analysis of data, One-way Analysis of Variance (ANOVA), t and Scheffe Meaningfulness Test, and Multiple Regression are applied. As a result of the study it is <b>inferred</b> <b>that</b> there is a statistically meaningful differentiation for male students among score means of locus of control according to gender. When sub factors of learning and studying strategies of trainee teachers according to their gender are analyzed, it is <b>inferred</b> <b>that</b> there is a meaningful differentiation among score means of motivation, anxiety, choosing main ideas and studying aids. It is <b>inferred</b> <b>that</b> there is no meaningful difference among score means of locus of control according to the university. It is <b>inferred</b> <b>that</b> there is a meaningful difference among score means of locus of control according to departments. When sub factors of learning and studying strategies are examined according to departments, it is <b>inferred</b> <b>that</b> there is a statistically meaningful differentiation among score means of attitude, using time, concentration, manipulating information, choosing main ideas, studying aids, and test strategies. According to the results of multiple regression analysis, it is found that double and partial correlations between predicting variable and dependant variable are negative and low...|$|R
25|$|Decisions {{rendered}} without {{reasons are}} not without implications: in the landmark decision in Padfield v.

25|$|The OLS {{estimator}} {{is identical}} to the maximum likelihood estimator (MLE) under the normality assumption for the error terms. This normality assumption has historical importance, as it provided the basis for the early work in linear regression analysis by Yule and Pearson. From the properties of MLE, we can <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> the OLS estimator is asymptotically efficient (in the sense of attaining the Cramér–Rao bound for variance) if the normality assumption is satisfied.|$|E
25|$|As for a {{sequence}} nominative-genitive, {{it may be}} the norm in Latin in a similar ratio. E.g. “Systema Naturae”. Indeed, the sequence nominative-genitive must always be the norm in Peano’s Interlingua, since the preposition de must introduce the genitive. Thus, Philosophiæ Naturalis Principia Mathematica would turn into Principio Mathematico de Philosophia Naturale. Since the function of both the adjective and the genitive is often the same, one might <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> the sequence noun-adjective might always be the norm.|$|E
50|$|From his {{finding that}} ethnically {{homogeneous}} societies, such as Japan and Korea, had similar rates of social mobility to ethnically diverse societies, {{such as the}} United States, Clark <b>infers</b> <b>that</b> racism {{may not be a}} significant factor affecting social mobility. From his finding that families who had many children were able to pass down their high social status just as well as families who had few children, Clark <b>infers</b> <b>that</b> simple inheritance of wealth cannot explain the persistence of high social status. From the referenced studies on the lack of correlation between the intelligence and adult family income of adopted children and their adoptive parents, Clark <b>infers</b> <b>that</b> family environment cannot explain the transmittal of social status {{from one generation to the}} next.|$|R

25|$|Hitler was not fond {{of modernism}} in the arts, which {{included}} music; in the Nazi party's program of February 1920, {{he threatened to}} enforce future governmental laws against such inclinations in art and literature. Even though he never publicly spoke out against jazz specifically in the Weimar Republic, one can <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> Hitler's sentiments toward jazz must have had strong ties to his perception of racial hierarchy, with jazz, not surprisingly, being at the very bottom.|$|E
25|$|While {{there is}} no first pay stub for the first work-for-pay exchange, the first {{salaried}} work would have required a society advanced {{enough to have a}} barter system which allowed for the even exchange of goods or services between tradesmen. More significantly, it presupposes the existence of organized employers—perhaps a government or a religious body—that would facilitate work-for-hire exchanges on a regular enough basis to constitute salaried work. From this, most <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> the first salary would have been paid in a village or city during the Neolithic Revolution, sometime between 10,000 BCE and 6000 BCE.|$|E
25|$|In 1802, William Paley {{published}} Natural Theology {{in response}} to naturalists such as Hume, refining the ancient teleological argument (or argument from design) to argue {{for the existence of}} God. He argued that life was so intricately designed and interconnected as to be analogous to a watch. Just as when one finds a watch, one reasonable infers that it was designed and constructed by an intelligent being, although one has never seen the designer, when one observes the complexity and intricacy of life, one may reasonably <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> it was designed and constructed by God, although one has never seen God.|$|E

25|$|UDP {{scanning}} is also possible, {{although there}} are technical challenges. UDP is a connectionless protocol {{so there is no}} equivalent to a TCP SYN packet. However, if a UDP packet is sent to a port that is not open, the system will respond with an ICMP port unreachable message. Most UDP port scanners use this scanning method, and use the absence of a response to <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> a port is open. However, if a port is blocked by a firewall, this method will falsely report that the port is open. If the port unreachable message is blocked, all ports will appear open. This method is also affected by ICMP rate limiting.|$|E
25|$|Unlike his father, Hesiod was {{averse to}} sea travel, but he once crossed the narrow strait between the Greek {{mainland}} and Euboea {{to participate in}} funeral celebrations for one Athamas of Chalcis, and there won a tripod in a singing competition. He also describes a meeting {{between himself and the}} Muses on Mount Helicon, where he had been pasturing sheep when the goddesses presented him with a laurel staff, a symbol of poetic authority (Theogony 22–35). Fanciful though the story might seem, the account has led ancient and modern scholars to <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> he was not a professionally trained rhapsode, or he would have been presented with a lyre instead.|$|E
25|$|In the 2ndcentury the satirist Lucian of Samosata {{was a sharp}} {{critic of}} Neo-Pythagoreanism. After 180AD he wrote a {{pamphlet}} where he attacked Alexander of Abonoteichus, a student of one of Apollonius’ students, as a charlatan; and suggested that the whole school was based on fraud. From this we can <b>infer</b> <b>that</b> Apollonius really had students and that his school survived at least until Lucian’s time. One of Philostratus’ foremost aims was to oppose this view. Although he related various miraculous feats of Apollonius, he emphasized {{at the same time}} that his hero was not a magician, but a serious philosopher and a champion of traditional Greek values.|$|E
