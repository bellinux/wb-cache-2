Remission: means changing the quantum of the punishment without changing its nature. for eg. reducing 20 year rigorous imprisonment to 10 years.|$|E

5000|$|The {{theory of}} the death row {{phenomenon}} may be traced to 1989, when the European Court of Human Rights agreed that poor conditions on death row in Virginia should mean that a fugitive should not be extradited to the US unless the US agreed it would not execute the fugitive should he or she be convicted.

[...] The preceding article protects those who are the depositaries of jurisdiction; the present article protects the exercise of said jurisdiction. It punishes any obstacle raised against the delivery or <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> or decision of the ecclesiastical authority. It is not question here {{of the power of}} order (potestas ordinis) or of facts that do not really imply jurisdiction, e.g. a simple contract. Nor is it question of measures taken with prelates so as to influence them into exercising their jurisdiction in a given direction, e.g. to confer a benefice on Caius or withhold one from Titius; this censure is meant to punish any obstacle that really prevents action {{on the part of a}} prelate who wishes to perform an act of jurisdiction or to carry it into effect. He is directly prevented when violence is used against him; indirectly, when his subordinates are prevented from acting. The chief opposition here considered is recourse to secular and especially judicial authority. Excommunication is therefore incurred under this head by all who provoke the intervention of secular tribunals, provided such intervention actually follow; by all who deliver orders or directions intended to prevent the exercise of ecclesiastical jurisdiction; finally, by all who cooperate in these acts with aid, counsel, or support, unless under compulsion.

5000|$|The {{concept of}} probation, from the Latin, probatio, [...] "testing," [...] has {{historical}} {{roots in the}} practice of judicial reprieve. In English common law, prior to the advent of democratic rule, the courts could temporarily suspend the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> to allow a criminal defendant to appeal to the monarch for a pardon. Probation first developed in the United States when John Augustus, a Boston cobbler, persuaded a judge in the Boston Police Court in 1841 to give him custody of a convicted offender, a [...] "drunkard," [...] for a brief period and then helped the man to appear rehabilitated by the time of sentencing. Even earlier, the practice of suspending a sentence was used as early as 1830 in Boston, Massachusetts, and became widespread in U.S. courts, although there was no statutory provision for such a practice. At first, judges, most notably Peter Oxenbridge Thatcher of Boston, used [...] "release on recognizance" [...] or bail and simply refrained from taking any further action. In 1878 the mayor of Boston had hired a former police officer, the ironically named [...] "Captain Savage," [...] to become what many recognize as the first official probation officer. By the mid-19th century, however, many Federal Courts were using a judicial reprieve to suspend sentence, and this posed a legal question. In 1916, the United States Supreme Court, in the Killets Decision, held that a Federal Judge (Killets) was without power to suspend a sentence indefinitely. This decision led to the passing of the National Probation Act of 1925, thereby, allowing courts to suspend the imposition of incarceration and place an offender on probation. Probation developed from the efforts of a philanthropist, John Augustus, who looked for ways to rehabilitate the behavior of criminals.|$|E

In this respect the German criminal statistic system has many deficits. Therefore it is necessary to supplement the existing statistics through periodical crime and victimisation surveys, to supplement the prison statistics and to implement statistics regarding suspected persons in the preliminary proceedings of public prosecutors, the enforcement of criminal sanctions as well as periodic reconviction statistic. But a comprehensive optimisation of the criminal statistics system requires the establishment of a statistical data base in which all data of the police crime statistics and all criminological relevant judicial decisions are recorded with pseudonymised individual data and subsequently linked with each other. This statistical data base will solve the problems of the current German crime statistics and will offer a basis for the implementation of new regular federal statistics, in particular with regard to the <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> and recidivism as well as the implementation of case-flow statistics and cohort studies. case-flow statistics, cohort studies, conviction statistics, crime, sanctions, criminal, police crime statistics, prison statistics, probation service statistics, recidivism, reconviction statistic, statistics of criminal courts, statistics of the public prosecution offices, victimisation survey...|$|E
40|$|Taken {{from the}} county jail By a set of curious chances; Liberated then on bail On my own recognizances. W. S. Gilbert 1885 e {{do not know the}} 'curious chances ' that {{resulted}} in the liberation on bail of the prisoner who subsequently became Lord High Executioner to the Mikado. The law and procedures relating to bail have, at least until recently, always been something of a mystery. Terms like recognizance, remand, respite and estreat are not understood by everybody in the community, including lawyers, and probably least by those most closely affected by them. This paper is not an exposition of the law on bail. It attempts to identify {{some of the problems that}} arose out of the old law on bail, examines how they have been tackled in recent Australian legislation, notably in New South Wales and Victoria, and looks at possible approaches for bail legislation in the future. Background to the Bail Acts Lord Devlin wrote of the right to bail that it was 'indeed curious that fundamental questions concerning bail have never been settled ' (Devlin 1960, p. 71). McClemens J, a Judge greatly experienced in the criminal law and procedure of New South Wales, remarked that 'the lack of a history of bail is reflected in the lack of written practice as to the exercise of jurisdiction in the Supreme Court ' (McClemens 1969, p. 43). For whatever reason, it may be taken that the Supreme Courts of the Australian states and territories have an inherent power to grant bail (although it may be argued that where the law on bail has been codified as in New South Wales the inherent power has been abolished). The power of all other courts, relating to bail, derives from statute, including the power of the High Court to grant bail to a prisoner committed to prison in <b>execution</b> <b>of</b> <b>a</b> <b>sentence</b> pending appeal or application for special leave to appeal (see Chamberlain v. ...|$|E
