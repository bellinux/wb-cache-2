5000|$|After <b>Drope</b> {{was indicted}} in 1969 for {{the rape of}} his wife, he filed a motion for a {{continuance}} requesting psychiatric evaluation and treatment. Attached to his motion was a psychiatric report recommending psychiatric treatment. This motion was denied and the case went to trial. Drope's wife testimony confirmed Drope's strange behavior described in the psychiatric report. She also testified that <b>Drope</b> had tried to kill her prior to trial. On day two of the trial, <b>Drope</b> shot himself in an attempted suicide and was hospitalized. Although he was absent in court, the trial court denied a motion for a mistrial {{on the grounds that}} his absence was voluntary and therefore the trial should continue. The jury found <b>Drope</b> guilty and sentenced him to life imprisonment. <b>Drope</b> filed a motion for a new trial on the grounds the trial court erred in continuing the trial when no evidence was offered to support that his absence was voluntary. This motion was denied based on the finding that his absence was voluntary. [...] The Missouri Supreme Court affirmed the decision. It also held that the trial court's denial of the motion for a continuance was not an abuse of judicial discretion. Drope's subsequent motion to vacate the conviction and sentence, alleging, among other things, that his constitutional rights had been violated both by the court's failure to order a pretrial psychiatric evaluation and by the trial court's continuing the trial to its completion in his absence, was denied.|$|E
5000|$|The Missouri Court of Appeals also affirmed, {{holding that}} neither the {{psychiatric}} evaluation attached to <b>Drope's</b> motion for a continuance nor his wife's testimony raised reasonable doubt as to his competence to proceed to trial. It further held that <b>Drope's</b> suicide attempt failed to create a reasonable doubt as to his competence {{and that he had}} not demonstrated any inadequacy in the legal procedures protecting his rights. The court also affirmed the trial court's finding that his absence from the trial was voluntary.|$|R

40|$|BACKGROUND: In this study, {{vaccination}} dropout reasons {{in children}} aged between 0 - 12 months was investigated. METHODS: A survey {{was carried out}} at eight primary health centers in the city center of Diyarbakir and also at three primary health centers, each in separate village. In collecting data, the records of &# 147;the form 012 records&# 148; (the card for the registration of vaccination) that were available at eight primary health centers. The children who were <b>droped</b> out vaccination were accepted as the cases of the survey. Through those records, 350 children aged between 1, 5 and 5 years, who remained <b>droped</b> out, were reached by-house-to-house visits. As the control group, for each <b>droped</b> out child one fully immunized child selected by the same method. The children were selected from the neighborhood of the same medical center and also {{of the same age}} group. Information about the mothers were collected by face-to-face- interviews. The features of underimmunized and fully immunized children were compared through the charts of frequency. Chi-square analysis was applied for the comparisons of the two group. For the factors that were considered to have effect on <b>droping</b> out, the odds ratios and 95 % confidence intervals were calculated. RESULTS: In the survey, it was seen that 62, 3 % of the mothers and 13, 4 % of the fathers of the underimmunized children were illiterate. It was also found that being the eighth child increased the risk of the underimmunization 6, 07 (% 95 CI: 2, 85 - 13, 09) folds in comparison to the first child. In fully immunized children, vaccination card application was better than <b>droped</b> out children. Having vaccination at home increases the risk of underimmunization. CONCLUSION: We concluded that mother&# 146;s education level, order of child, consoling after vaccination, giving vaccine card, home visits for vaccination were the factors related with vaccination dropout.
