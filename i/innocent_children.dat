500|$|The High Court was {{convened in}} the Supreme Court Building on 25March 1983. [...] Presiding {{over the case}} were two judges: Justice Thirugnana Sampanthar Sinnathuray, who would deliver {{judgment}} on serial murderer John Martin Scripps 13years later, and Justice Frederick Arthur Chua, {{who was at the}} time the longest serving judge in Singapore. [...] Knight continued to build his case on the evidence gathered by detective work. [...] Photographs of the crime scenes, together with witness testimonies, would help the court to visualise the events that led to the crimes. Other evidencethe blood samples, religious objects, drugs, and the notes with Ng and Ghazali's namesconclusively proved the defendants' involvement. [...] Knight had no eyewitnesses to the murders; his evidence was circumstantial, but he told the court in his opening statement, [...] "What matters is that [...] did intentionally suffocate and drown these two <b>innocent</b> <b>children,</b> causing their deaths in circumstances which amount to murder. [...] And this we will prove beyond all reasonable doubt." ...|$|E

500|$|The {{allegations}} of Harding's other known mistress, Nan Britton, long remained uncertain. In 1927, Britton, also a Marionite, published The President's Daughter, alleging that her child Elizabeth Ann Blaesing had been fathered by Harding. The book, which {{was dedicated to}} [...] "all unwedded mothers" [...] and [...] "their <b>innocent</b> <b>children</b> whose fathers are usually not known to the world", was sold, like pornography, door-to-door wrapped in brown paper. The late president's reputation had deteriorated since his death in 1923, and many believed Britton. The public was tantalized by salacious details such as Britton's claim that the two had sex in a White House closet, with Secret Service agents posted to ward off intruders. Although {{part of the public}} believed her, a jury found against her when she alleged she was libeled by a refutation of her book. According to Harding family lore, the late president was infertile and could not have fathered a child, having suffered from mumps in childhood; Britton maintained that Harding had provided child support of $500 per month for the daughter he never met, but she had destroyed romantic correspondence from him at his request.|$|E

2500|$|Unfortunately for Labour, {{the wide}} range of local-level policy {{initiatives}} that this engendered made it easy for Conservative opponents to then apply the [...] "Loony Left" [...] blanket label that the news media had handed to them, a political card that the Conservatives played at both local and national levels. [...] The label was a particularly effective tactic against Labour-controlled local education authorities, because the suggestion of <b>innocent</b> <b>children</b> being manipulated to further cynical adult political goals was a very potent image.|$|E

2500|$|Tunisia {{participated in}} the Yom Kippur War, sending 1,000–2,000 troops to fight {{alongside}} a coalition of Arab countries against Israel. The relations worsened further in the early 2000s when the Second Intifada began, and on 22 October 2000, the state radio of Tunisia declared that President Ben Ali had decided to break all diplomatic ties with Israel following the [...] "violence in the Palestinian-controlled territories". On 21 Oct, Ben Ali had issued a strong condemnation of [...] "the violation of the holy shrine of Al Quds Al Sharif, the repeated Israeli provocations, the use of weapons against <b>innocent</b> <b>children</b> and defenseless people, and the racist persecution of Arab Palestinian citizens", which [...] "constitute flagrant violations of sanctities and human rights, and a blatant aggression against all human values and practices". On 22 October itself Israel expressed its disappointment at the Tunisian decision to sever relations and to close the Tunisian Interest Office in Tel Aviv and the Israeli Interest Office in Tunis. Expressing [...] "surprise", the Israeli Foreign Ministry said: [...] "It appears that Tunisia has elected to renounce its potential role as a bridge for dialogue between Israel and its neighbours, thereby harming the critical effort to promote regional peace".|$|E
