In 2004, a U.S. Department of Justice (USDOJ) investigation found that Cracker Barrel discriminated against minority customers; patrons complained of racially segregated seating and service quality. In an agreement with the USDOJ, Cracker Barrel implemented non-discrimination policies and pledged to focus on improving minority representation and civic involvement, particularly in the black community. Company shareholders added sexual orientation to the company's non-discrimination policy in 2002.|$|E
5|$|Those {{involved}} {{in the construction of}} taiko are usually considered part of the burakumin, a marginalized minority class in Japanese society, particularly those working with leather or animal skins. Prejudice against this class dates back to the Tokugawa period in terms of legal discrimination and treatment as social outcasts. Although official discrimination ended with the Tokugawa era, the burakumin have continued to face social discrimination, such as scrutiny by employers or in marriage arrangements.

5|$|The colonial {{venture into}} modernity brought {{concepts}} of democracy, equality and individual rights. The {{rise of the}} concept of nationalism and introspection of <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practices</b> brought about social reform movements related to caste and gender relations. This first phase of feminism in India was initiated by men to uproot the social evils of sati (widow immolation), to allow widow remarriage, to forbid child marriage, and to reduce illiteracy, as well as to regulate the age of consent and to ensure property rights through legal intervention. In addition to this, some upper caste Hindu women rejected constraints they faced under Brahminical traditions. However, efforts for improving the status of women in Indian society were somewhat thwarted by the late nineteenth century, as nationalist movements emerged in India. These movements resisted 'colonial interventions in gender relations' particularly in the areas of family relations. In the mid to late nineteenth century, there was a national form of resistance to any colonial efforts made to 'modernise' the Hindu family. This included the Age of Consent controversy that erupted after the government tried to raise the age of marriage for women.|$|E

In 1971, Delta and the Congressional Black Caucus co-sponsored National Policy Conferences on Education for Blacks, which focused on disparities and deficiencies in schools with high Black populations. The right to read program was established in 1973 to help the functionally illiterate. In 1975, Delta established life development centers to focus on issues placed by individuals from early childhood to senior citizens.|$|E

25|$|After partition, Muslim banking {{shifted from}} Bombay to Karachi, Pakistan's first capital. Much of the {{investment}} in East Pakistan came from West Pakistani banks. The largest jute processing factory in the world, at Narayanganj, an industrial suburb of Dhaka, was owned by the Adamjee family from West Pakistan. Because banking and financing were generally controlled by West Pakistanis, <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practices</b> often resulted. This preference became more pronounced after explosive labor clashes between the Biharis and Bengalis at the Narayaganj jute mill in 1954.|$|E

Employers would not be required to use these powers, but would be able to do so without the threat of legal action for <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practices.</b> The white paper also proposed measures to end age discrimination, promote transparency in organisations and introduce a new equality duty on the public sector.|$|E
25|$|Cleveland {{had long}} {{suffered}} from racially <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practices</b> by lending institutions, and in 1979 residents of Union-Miles Park began picketing lenders, including the Federal Housing Administration (FHA).

Many {{of the most}} affordable homes were owned or leased by public housing agencies, yet these homes {{were some of the}} most decrepit in the area.

25|$|Linguistic {{profiling}} is {{the practice}} of identifying the social characteristics of an individual based on auditory cues, in particular dialect and accent. The theory was first developed by Professor John Baugh to explain <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practices</b> {{in the housing market}} based on the auditory redlining of prospective clientele by housing administrators. Linguistic profiling extends to issues of legal proceedings, employment opportunities, and education. The theory is frequently described as the auditory equivalent of racial profiling. The bulk of the research and evidence in support of the theory pertain to racial and ethnic distinctions, though its applicability holds within racial or ethnic groups, perceived gender and sexual orientation, and in distinguishing location of geographic origin.|$|E

40|$|Studies {{have found}} that on average males earn {{substantially}} higher wages than females. Females are paid lower {{than their male counterparts}} due to several reasons such as educational attainment, job characteristics and types of industries. Even after accounting for variations in these productivity- related characteristics, gender wage differentials may still prevail as a result of <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practice</b> by employers. This paper attempts to measure the determinants of wage differentials by gender in the Malaysian manufacturing sector. The analysis is based on a survey of 2, 046 workers in six major industries conducted in 1999. These are the electrical and electronics, textile, woodbased, transport equipment, food and chemical industries. The determinants of wage differentials are obtained by using the coefficients of the earnings functions. These factors are decomposed into several categories, namely, demographic factors, human capital, job characteristics and industry characteristics. The results reveal that demographic factors and human capital variables {{play a major role in}} determining the wage differentials by gender. The divergence coefficient, which might include <b>discriminatory</b> <b>practice</b> by the employers, is also quite small. Gender wage differentials, Manufacturing sector, Malaysia...|$|R
