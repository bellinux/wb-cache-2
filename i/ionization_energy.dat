5|$|The first <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> is {{the energy}} {{it takes to}} remove one {{electron}} from an atom, the second <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> is the energy it takes to remove a second electron from the atom, and so on. For a given atom, successive ionization energies increase with the degree of ionization. For magnesium as an example, the first <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> is 738kJ/mol {{and the second is}} 1450kJ/mol. Electrons in the closer orbitals experience greater forces of electrostatic attraction; thus, their removal requires increasingly more energy. <b>Ionization</b> <b>energy</b> becomes greater up and {{to the right of the}} periodic table.|$|E
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} period show trends in atomic radius, <b>ionization</b> <b>energy,</b> {{electron}} affinity, and electronegativity. Moving left to right across a period, atomic radius usually decreases. This occurs because each successive element has an added proton and electron, which causes the electron to be drawn closer to the nucleus. This decrease in atomic radius also causes the <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> to increase when moving from left to right across a period. The more tightly bound an element is, the more energy is required to remove an electron. Electronegativity increases {{in the same}} manner as <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> because of the pull exerted on the electrons by the nucleus. Electron affinity also shows a slight trend across a period. Metals (left side of a period) generally have a lower electron affinity than nonmetals (right side of a period), with the exception of the noble gases.|$|E

All the <b>ionization</b> <b>energies</b> obtained lie in the range 7. 0 - 8. 4 eV. The phenothiazines are thus strong electron donors, in agreement with calculations. There is little difference in <b>ionization</b> <b>energies</b> and equilibrium constants of complex formation between tranquillizers and either non-tranquillizers or timulants.

40|$|Graduation date: 1995 The {{photoelectron}} {{spectra of}} a series of ketone compounds have been investigated in the gas phase. Core <b>ionization</b> <b>energies</b> were measured to probe the effects of molecular size and connectivity number on core <b>ionization</b> <b>energies.</b> It was found that core <b>ionization</b> <b>energies</b> roughly decrease with increasing connectivity number as expected. However, subdividing into several categories based on the molecular type gives improved correlations. These results show both the effect of molecular size and that of bringing the polarizable group closer to the core ionized center. In some cases, compounds with the same connectivity number have different core <b>ionization</b> <b>energies</b> and, in others, compounds with different connectivity number have the same core <b>ionization</b> <b>energies.</b> These discrepancies indicate that the simple method for calculating connectivity numbers must be modified to reflect different molecular types. Other discrepancies indicate that this method does not correctly predict the effects of remote hydrogens or the effects of aromatic substituents, where conjugation may influence the relaxation energy...|$|R
5|$|Elements in {{the same}} group tend to show {{patterns}} in atomic radius, <b>ionization</b> <b>energy,</b> and electronegativity. From top to bottom in a group, the atomic radii of the elements increase. Since there are more filled energy levels, valence electrons are found farther from the nucleus. From the top, each successive element has a lower <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> because {{it is easier to}} remove an electron since the atoms are less tightly bound. Similarly, a group has a top-to-bottom decrease in electronegativity due to an increasing distance between valence electrons and the nucleus. There are exceptions to these trends, however: for example, in group 11, electronegativity increases farther down the group.|$|E
5|$|Sodium atoms have 11 electrons, {{one more}} than the {{extremely}} stable configuration of the noble gas neon. Because of this and its low first <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> of 495.8 kJ/mol, the sodium atom {{is much more likely}} to lose the last electron and acquire a positive charge than to gain one and acquire a negative charge. This process requires so little energy that sodium is readily oxidized by giving up its 11th electron. In contrast, the second <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> is very high (4562 kJ/mol), because the 10th electron is closer to the nucleus than the 11th electron. As a result, sodium usually forms ionic compounds involving the Na+ cation.|$|E

5|$|Due to the {{stabilization}} of its outer 8s electron, ununennium's first ionization energy—the energy required to remove an electron from a neutral atom—is predicted to be 4.53eV, {{higher than those}} of the known alkali metals from potassium onward. This effect is so large that unbiunium (element 121) is predicted to have a lower <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> of 4.45eV, so that the alkali metal in period 8 would not have the lowest <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> in the period, as is true for all previous periods. Ununennium's electron affinity is expected to be far greater than that of caesium and francium; indeed, ununennium is expected to have an electron affinity higher than all the alkali metals lighter than it. Relativistic effects also cause a very large drop in the polarizability of ununennium, to 169.7a.u.

5|$|This {{exception}} arises due to competing {{horizontal and}} vertical trends in the nuclear charge.

With some irregularities, atoms therefore become smaller, <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> increases, {{and there is a}} gradual change in character, across a period, from strongly metallic, to weakly metallic, to weakly nonmetallic, to strongly nonmetallic elements. Going down a main group, the effect of increasing nuclear charge is generally outweighed by the effect of additional electrons being further away from the nucleus. Atoms generally become larger, <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> falls, and metallic character increases.

Seventeen elements are generally classified as nonmetals; most are gases (hydrogen, helium, nitrogen, oxygen, fluorine, neon, chlorine, argon, krypton, xenon and radon); one is a liquid (bromine), and a few are solids (carbon, phosphorus, sulphur, selenium, and iodine).|$|E

Phosphorus substitutes carbon in the diamond lattice. Similar to nitrogen, phosphorus has one more electron than carbon and thus acts as a donor; however, the <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> of phosphorus (0.6 eV) is much smaller than that of nitrogen (1.7 eV) and is small enough for room-temperature thermal ionization.

5|$|Plasma {{temperature}} is commonly measured in kelvins or electronvolts and is, informally, {{a measure of}} the thermal kinetic energy per particle. High temperatures are usually needed to sustain ionization, which is a defining feature of a plasma. The degree of plasma ionization is determined by the electron temperature relative to the <b>ionization</b> <b>energy</b> (and more weakly by the density), in a relationship called the Saha equation.

Similar to other large impurities, the major form of silicon in diamond has been identified with a Si-vacancy complex (semi-divacancy site).

For the test molecules, indole and tryptophan, this approach yields aqueous <b>ionization</b> <b>energies</b> (4. 46 and 4. 58 eV, respectively) in agreement with experimental values (4. 35 and 4. 45 eV). When uridine and 2 ′-deoxythymidine <b>ionization</b> <b>energies</b> are evaluated, the results agree with recent data from 193 -nm laser measurements indicating that uridine ionization occurs via a one-photon event. For 5 ′-dCMP− and 5 ′-dTMP−, a comparison of aqueous <b>ionization</b> <b>energies</b> with gas-phase <b>ionization</b> potentials (IPs) indicates that hydration alters the relative <b>energies</b> of <b>ionization</b> events. In the gas phase, phosphate vertical IPs are ∼ 1. 3 eV smaller than base IPs.
