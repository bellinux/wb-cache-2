And number two, the mainstream issues in this campaign had been, quote, southern issues since {{way back in the}} sixties. So Reagan goes out and campaigns on the issues of economics and of national defense. The whole campaign was devoid of any kind of racism, any kind of reference. And I'll tell you another thing you all need to think about, that even surprised me, is the lack of interest, really, the lack of knowledge right now in the South among white voters about the Voting Rights Act.|$|E

25|$|When Mark Coleman got {{injured and}} had {{to drop out of}} his matchup against Tito Ortiz, Griffin {{accepted}} a rematch against Ortiz at UFC 106. Griffin also wore white and black fight shorts instead of his trademark tan shorts for the fight. Griffin {{went on to win the}} gory battle by split decision, showing superior striking skills and a stronger ground game than in their previous fight. After the fight Griffin said, “Tito was a great fight for me to come back, we’ll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> third that’s 1-1 man.” With a split decision in both of their fights, Griffin seemed more than willing to get a rubber match put together with Ortiz to settle the score once and for all. “You could tell he was a guy getting ready for Mark Coleman, no offense, and he’s a guy coming off back surgery. We’ll do it again, I won’t break my foot, he’ll be in better shape,” commented Griffin.|$|E

I belong in both places and I love them both equally." [...] She holds both Swedish and Canadian passports. Apart from speaking fluent English and Swedish, she also speaks French and Spanish. She describes herself as a feminist as she believes in equal treatment for both sexes, but also considers that [...] "We [...] are different", adding that she [...] "embrace those differences."

In an interview, Clarke had previously indicated she had become reluctant to do nude scenes unless it served the plot. After the episode aired, Clarke made a point to indicate {{that it was not}} a body double in {{the final scene}} of the episode, stating, [...] "I'd like to remind people the last time I took my clothes off was season 3. That was awhile ago. It's now season 6. But this is all me, all proud, all strong. I'm just feeling genuinely happy I said 'Yes.' That ain't no body double!"

500|$|In 2004, Lohan had two lead roles. The first film, Disney's teen comedy Confessions of a Teenage Drama Queen, {{earned a}} {{domestic}} box office total of $29million, with Brandon Gray of Box Office Mojo commenting {{that it was}} [...] "well above expectations as it was strictly for young girls." [...] But the film did not meet with critical acclaim. Robert K. Elder of the Chicago Tribune wrote that [...] "though still a promising star, Lohan will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> little penance before she's forgiven for Confessions." [...] Her second lead role that year, in the teen comedy Mean Girls, marked Lohan's first movie independent of Disney. Based {{in part on the}} non-fiction book Queen Bees and Wannabes, the film stars Lohan as a previously homeschooled 16-year-old learning to navigate the social cliques of a public high school. It was a critical and commercial success, grossing $129million worldwide and, according to Brandon Gray, [...] "cementing her status as the new teen movie queen." [...] Mick LaSalle from the San Francisco Chronicle wrote that [...] "Lohan is sensitive and appealing, a solid locus for audience sympathy." [...] David Rooney from Variety said that [...] "Lohan displays plenty of charm, verve and deft comic timing." [...] Lohan received four awards at the 2004 Teen Choice Awards for Freaky Friday and Mean Girls, including Breakout Movie Star. Mean Girls also earned her two awards at the 2005 MTV Movie Awards. With Mean Girls, Lohan's public profile was raised significantly. Vanity Fair described how she became a household name. Paparazzi began following her and her love life and partying became frequent targets of gossip sites and the tabloid media. Following Mean Girls, which was scripted by former [...] "Not Ready For Prime Time Actress" [...] Tina Fey and featured several other veterans of Saturday Night Live's [...] "Not Ready For Prime Time Company," [...] Lohan hosted the show three times between 2004 and 2006.

2500|$|After {{constantly}} explaining {{concepts and}} story outlines to interviewers and fans, Turner chose {{to keep the}} thematic basis of In the Absence of Truth quiet. [...] "Through explaining the last two albums time and time again, I just started to become weary of the topic, and I started to feel like I was losing my connection to {{the music and the}} lyrics simply from having repeated it so many times [...] I feel there's a lot of emphasis these days placed on explaining everything in such a fashion that there's really nothing left for the listener or reader to explore themselves.

50|$|In the Netherlands {{one must}} {{complete}} medical school after {{which one is}} certified as a medical doctor.

2500|$|The actors {{lived in}} Crema {{and were able}} to absorb the rhythm of small town life.

[...] "We’d hang out with each other all the time, because we were pretty much the only Americans there, and we were able to defend one another and really get to know one another," [...] Chalamet recalled. The actors rehearsed their scenes every night before shooting, and spent several days shooting completely nude. [...] "I’ve never been so intimately involved with a director before.

2500|$|During an interview, Butler {{admitted}} that while reading the sickening facts of slavery {{as depicted in}} slave narratives she realized that if she wanted people to read her book, she would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> somewhat sanitized version of slavery. Still, scholars of Kindred consider the novel a non-romanticized fiction of the slave experience. Concluding that [...] "there probably is no more vivid depiction of life on an Eastern Shore plantation than that found in Kindred," [...] Sandra Y. Govan traces how Butler's book follows the classic patterns of the memoirs of former slaves: loss of innocence, harsh punishment, strategies of resistance, life in the slave quarters, struggle for education, experience of sexual abuse, realization of the masters' religious hypocrisy, and attempts to run away which culminate in success. Robert Crossley notes how Butler's intense first-person narration deliberately echoes the re-tellings of ex-slaves, thereby giving the story [...] "a degree of authenticity and seriousness." [...] Lisa Yaszek sees Dana's visceral first-hand account as a deliberate criticism of commercialized productions of slavery, such as the film Gone with the Wind and the television miniseries Roots.|$|E

The problem has to do with the calcification of the bone that was broken with the tear, and that had to be operated on. You have to let it run its course."
