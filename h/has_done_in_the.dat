5|$|Fox Mulder's (David Duchovny) mind flashes back {{to being}} in the attic with his sister Samantha while their parents are arguing downstairs. Back in the present, Mulder awakens {{in a hotel room}} in Providence, Rhode Island, covered in blood. Mulder calls Dana Scully (Gillian Anderson), who arrives, finding him in shock. Mulder has a {{pounding}} headache and has no memory of what he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past two days. Scully finds that two bullets have been fired from Mulder's gun and that he has keys belonging to a David and Amy Cassandra. Scully wants Mulder to check into a hospital, but he wants to find out if he was involved in a crime before doing so. The agents arrive at the Cassandra's house where the housekeeper tells them they are not at home. Mulder recognizes a house in many of Cassandra's paintings: a house that is near his parent's summer home in Rhode Island. When they arrive there, Mulder has striking pains in his head and flashes back again to when he was a child, seeing a younger version of The Smoking Man (Chris Owens) in his home. The agents enter the home, where they find the Cassandras dead from gunshot wounds.|$|E

According to Soaps In Depth, [...] " [...] threw {{a lot of money}} at her to get her to stay, but she thought it was the right time to go". A representative for the show stated, [...] " [...] is taking short a break, as she <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past, from B She remains as the character of 'Steffy Forrester' and is continuing to tape, currently with episodes airing through July 2013 and then beyond".

500|$|It {{was also}} noted that Lewis' [...] "delicately seductive vocals are more versatile", with the Detroit Free Press stating that her voice [...] "smoothly mixes classic country with pop and indie-rock, Lewis is as adept on the ballads as {{she is on the}} rave-ups." [...] The Times {{considered}} Lewis' songwriting [...] "leagues ahead of anything that she <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past" [...] and her vocals sound [...] "as though she means it". DeRogatis pointed out that [...] "Lewis' impressive strength as both a singer and a songwriter is that she makes every listener feel as if her music was crafted just for them." [...] However, Angela Zimmerman of Crawdaddy! felt that Lewis often used a [...] "pervasive soprano that she can't quite execute" [...] on tracks like [...] "Black Sand", [...] "Pretty Bird", [...] "Trying My Best to Love You", and [...] "Jack Killed Mom".|$|E

500|$|... "Don't Judge Me" [...] {{generated}} positive {{reviews from}} music critics. Trent Fitzgerald of PopCrush and Mesfin Fekadu of the Associated Press {{viewed it as}} one of the standout tracks on Fortune. Amy Sciarretto (also writing for PopCrush), noted that the song [...] "demonstrates that [...] side we don't often see" [...] from Brown. Jamel Coles, in the UAB Kaleidoscope described [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] as an [...] "emotional track" [...] and wrote, [...] "when hearing songs like this, you can't knock his ability to make good music." [...] Jasmine Grant of Juicy magazine viewed the song as a [...] "heartfelt ballad," [...] and Maura Johnston of Rolling Stone wrote that it sounds like [...] "a Twitter rant against haters." [...] Melissa Ruggieri of The Atlanta Journal-Constitution described [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] as a [...] "lilting ballad" [...] and noted that Brown is [...] "semi-serious" [...] in the song. A reviewer on 4Music called the song [...] "undeniably emotional" [...] and wrote, [...] "we're wondering is if this is a heart-wrenching plea to Rihanna?" [...] Sharon O'Connell of Time Out magazine commented on the song's title: [...] "it's a little late for that." [...] The Chicago Sun-Times Thomas Conner called it a [...] "bland, breathy ballad." [...] In his review of Fortune, Nick Levine of BBC Music wrote that the song {{was one of the reasons}} why the album felt [...] "cripplingly pointless." [...] Scott Kara of The New Zealand Herald described [...] "Don't Judge Me" [...] as [...] "weak and wincing," [...] and stated that the lyrics are [...] "the words of someone who still doesn't quite grasp the extent of what he <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past." ...|$|E
500|$|The Earl {{had always}} {{attempted}} to promote on merit rather than patronage {{and had become}} increasingly frustrated with the system of preferment by social rank and not competence. At his retirement in 1807 he had an audience with the King. The King asked if the navy were a better institution now {{than it had been}} on St Vincent's entrance into it. St Vincent replied that it was not. He stated: [...] "Sire I have always thought that a sprinkling of nobility was very desirable in the Navy, as it gives some sort of consequence to the service; but at present the Navy is so overrun by the younger branches of nobility, and the sons of Members of Parliament and they so swallow up all the patronage and so choke the channel to promotion, that the son of an old Officer, however meritorious both their services may have been, has little or no chance of getting on." [...] He continued on [...] "I would rather promote the son of an old deserving Officer than of any noble in the land." [...] In a letter dated 18 October 1806 to Viscount Howick, then the First Lord. [...] "If you will, my good Lord, bring a bill into Parliament to disqualify any Officer under the rank of Rear-Admiral to sit in the House of Commons, the Navy may be preserved; but while a little, drunken, worthless jackanapes is permitted to hold the seditious language he <b>has</b> <b>done,</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> presence of Flag-officers of rank, you will require a man of greater health and vigour than I possess to command your fleets." [...] Presumably St Vincent was referring to a particular member of Parliament although his feelings on the subject remain clear.|$|E

2500|$|In 2003, {{the band}} {{released}} their seventh album Splinter. The Offspring recruited Josh Freese {{to record the}} drums for Splinter and later announced that Atom Willard would be the official replacement for Ron Welty. The album's original title was to be Chinese Democrazy (You Snooze, You Lose), from {{the name of the}} long-delayed album by Guns N' Roses. As a result, Guns N' Roses frontman Axl Rose filed a cease and desist order against the Offspring, but eventually began to calm down when he realized the date this was announced was April 1. The first single [...] "Hit That" [...] enjoyed moderate success on MTV.

2500|$|On 17 March 1984, Blainey {{addressed}} a major Rotary {{conference in the}} Victorian city of Warrnambool. He regretted that the Hawke Labor Government in [...] "a time of large unemployment" [...] was bringing many new migrants to the areas of high unemployment, thus fostering tension. He blamed the government, not the migrants themselves. Criticising what he viewed as disproportionately high levels of Asian immigration, then running at 40 per cent of the annual intake, he added: [...] "Rarely {{in the history of}} the modern world has a nation given such preference to a tiny ethnic minority of its population as the Australian Government <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past few years, making that minority the favoured majority in its immigration policy".|$|E

[...] Maimonides said that everything happens in accord with God's will, and, nevertheless, we are responsible for our deeds. Explaining how this apparent contradiction is resolved, Maimonides said that just as God desired that fire rises upward and water descends downward, so too, God desired that people have free choice and be responsible for their deeds, without being pulled or forced. Rather, people, on their own initiative, {{with the knowledge that}} God granted them, do anything that people are able to do. Therefore, people are judged according to their deeds. If they do good, they are treated with beneficence. If they do bad, they are treated harshly. This is implied by the prophets.|$|E

2500|$|Harsh V. Pant, {{professor}} of International relations at King's College London, highlighted {{the importance of}} India to US strategic planning by saying: [...] "India {{is key to the}} US’ ability to create a stable {{balance of power in the}} larger Indo-Pacific and at a time of resource constraints, it needs partners like India to shore up its sagging credibility in the region in face of Chinese onslaught." [...] Robert Boggs, {{professor of}} South Asia Studies at the Near East South Asia Center for Strategic Studies, opines that the US [...] "overestimates both India’s desire to improve the relationship and the benefits doing so would bring". Neelam Deo, director of foreign policy at Gateway House, underscored the importance that India attaches safeguarding its national interests by saying: [...] "India is a big country, with its own strategic objectives and imperatives and it will act on opportunities where interests converge, as it <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> past." ...|$|E
2500|$|This led to {{even lower}} demand for both {{products}} and labor, which further deepened {{the recession and}} made it ever more difficult to generate tax revenues and fight public indebtedness. According to Financial Times chief economics commentator Martin Wolf, [...] "structural tightening does deliver actual tightening. But its impact is much less than one to one. A one percentage point reduction in the structural deficit delivers a 0.67 percentage point improvement in the actual fiscal deficit." [...] This means that Ireland e.g. would require structural fiscal tightening of more than 12% to eliminate its 2012 actual fiscal deficit. A task {{that is difficult to}} achieve without an exogenous eurozone-wide economic boom. Austerity is bound to fail if it relies largely on tax increases instead of cuts in government expenditures coupled with encouraging [...] "private investment and risk-taking, labor mobility and flexibility, an end to price controls, tax rates that encouraged capital formation ..." [...] as Germany <b>has</b> <b>done</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> decade before the crisis. According to the Europlus Monitor Report 2012, no country should tighten its fiscal reins by more than 2% of GDP in one year, in order to avoid recession.|$|E

[...] Brad Bell {{came up to me and}} said, [...] "How does it feel to be Emmy nominated?" [...] For that year, Wood submitted the scenes in which Steffy is informed of the end of her affair with Bill. In 2013, Wood garnered her second consecutive nomination in that category at the 40th Daytime Emmy Awards, in which she submitted the scenes where Steffy surprises Liam (Scott Clifton) by presenting him with signed annulment papers. In May 2013, news broke that Wood had opted not to renew her contract with the show in order to take another break.
