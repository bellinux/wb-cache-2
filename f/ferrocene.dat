5|$|The {{history of}} {{organometallic}} chemistry includes the 19th-century discoveries of Zeise's salt and nickel tetracarbonyl. These compounds posed {{a challenge to}} chemists as the compounds did not fit with existing chemical bonding models. A further challenge arose {{with the discovery of}} <b>ferrocene,</b> the iron analogue of rhodocene and the first of the class of compounds now known as metallocenes. <b>Ferrocene</b> was found to be unusually chemically stable, as were analogous chemical structures including rhodocenium, the unipositive cation of rhodocene and its cobalt and iridium counterparts. The study of organometallic species including these ultimately {{led to the development of}} new bonding models that explained their formation and stability. Work on sandwich compounds, including the rhodocenium-rhodocene system, earned Geoffrey Wilkinson and Ernst Otto Fischer the 1973 Nobel Prize for Chemistry.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium forms a {{wide range}} {{compounds}} with carbon-ruthenium bonds. Grubbs' catalyst is used for alkene metathesis. Ruthenocene is analogous to <b>ferrocene</b> structurally, but exhibits distinctive redox properties. The colorless liquid ruthenium pentacarbonyl converts {{in the absence of}} CO pressure to the dark red solid triruthenium dodecacarbonyl. Ruthenium trichloride reacts with carbon monoxide to give many derivatives including RuHCl(CO)(PPh3)3 and Ru(CO)2(PPh3)3 (Roper's complex). Heating solutions of ruthenium trichloride in alcohols with triphenylphosphine gives tris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium dichloride (RuCl2(PPh3)3), which converts to the hydride complex chlorohydridotris(triphenylphosphine)ruthenium(II) (RuHCl(PPh3)3).|$|E

The rhodium–centroid distance is 1.904Å and the rhodium–carbon bond lengths average 2.26Å; the carbon–carbon bond lengths average 1.44Å. These distances are all similar to those found in the 1,2,3-tri-tert-butylrhodocenium cation described above, with the one difference that the effective size of the rhodium centre appears larger, an observation consistent with the expanded ionic radius of rhodium(II) compared with rhodium(III).|$|E

5|$|The {{team from}} the University of Mainz were {{planning}} to study the electrodeposition of hassium atoms using the new TASCA facility at the GSI. Their aim was to use the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,4n)270Hs. In addition, scientists at the GSI were hoping to utilize TASCA to study the synthesis and properties of the hassium(II) compound hassocene, Hs(C5H5)2, using the reaction 226Ra(48Ca,xn). This compound {{is analogous to the}} lighter <b>ferrocene,</b> ruthenocene, and osmocene, and is expected to have the two cyclopentadienyl rings in an eclipsed conformation like ruthenocene and osmocene and not in a staggered conformation like <b>ferrocene.</b> Hassocene was chosen because it has hassium in the low formal oxidation state of +2 (although the bonding between the metal and the rings is mostly covalent in metallocenes) rather than the high +8 state which had previously been investigated, and relativistic effects were expected to be stronger in the lower oxidation state. Many metals in the periodic table form metallocenes, so that trends could be more easily determined, and the highly symmetric structure of hassocene and its low number of atoms also make relativistic calculations easier. Hassocene should be a stable and highly volatile compound.|$|E
5|$|Ruthenium and osmium {{have very}} similar {{chemistry}} {{due to the}} lanthanide contraction, but iron shows some differences from them: for example, although ruthenium and osmium form stable tetroxides in which the metal is in the +8 oxidation state, iron does not. Consequently, {{in preparation for the}} chemical characterization of hassium, researches focused on ruthenium and osmium rather than iron, as hassium was expected to also be similar to ruthenium and osmium due to the actinide contraction. Nevertheless, in the planned experiment to study hassocene (Hs(C5H5)2), <b>ferrocene</b> may also be used for comparison along with ruthenocene and osmocene.|$|E
5|$|These data clearly {{indicate}} {{the stability of}} neutral <b>ferrocene</b> and the cobaltocenium and rhodocenium cations. Rhodocene is ca. 500mV more reducing than cobaltocene, indicating {{that it is more}} readily oxidised and hence less stable. An earlier polarographic investigation of rhodocenium perchlorate at neutral pH showed a cathodic wave peak at −1.53V (versus SCE) at the dropping mercury electrode, corresponding to the formation rhodocene in solution, but the researchers were unable to isolate the neutral product from solution. In the same study, attempts to detect iridocene by exposing iridocenium salts to oxidising conditions were unsuccessful even at elevated pH. These data are consistent with rhodocene being highly unstable and may indicate that iridocene is even more unstable still.|$|E

The Cp and the aromatic rings are positioned out of the plane, with a twist angle of 70. 20  (12) °, and the C(Cp) —C(CO) bond length is shorter than a typical C—C single bond, which suggests a partial double-bond character and delocalization with the Cp π system.

5|$|Iron {{shows the}} {{characteristic}} chemical {{properties of the}} transition metals, namely the ability to form variable oxidation states differing by steps of one and a very large coordination and organometallic chemistry: indeed, it was the discovery of an iron compound, <b>ferrocene,</b> that revolutionalized the latter field in the 1950s. Iron is sometimes considered as a prototype for the entire block of transition metals, due to its abundance and the immense role it has played in the technological progress of humanity. Its 26 electrons are arranged in the configuration 3d64s2, of which the 3d and 4s electrons are relatively close in energy, and thus it can lose a variable number of electrons {{and there is no}} clear point where further ionization becomes unprofitable.|$|E
5|$|Octaphenylrhodocene, , is {{the first}} rhodocene {{derivative}} to be isolated at room temperature. Its olive green crystals decompose rapidly in solution, and within minutes in air, demonstrating a dramatically greater air sensitivity than the analogous cobalt complex, although it is significantly more stable than rhodocene itself. This difference is attributed to the relatively lower stability of the rhodium(II) state {{as compared to the}} cobalt(II) state. The reduction potential for the + cation (measured in dimethylformamide relative the ferrocenium / <b>ferrocene</b> couple) is −1.44V, consistent with the greater thermodynamic stabilisation of the rhodocene by the C5HPh4 ligand compared with the C5H5 or C5Me5 ligands. Cobaltocene is a useful one-electron reducing agent in the research laboratory as it is soluble in non-polar organic solvents, and its redox couple is sufficiently well behaved that it may be used as an internal standard in cyclic voltammetry. No substituted rhodocene yet prepared has demonstrated sufficient stability to be used in a similar way.|$|E
5|$|BF4 forms a {{colourless}} centrosymmetric monoclinic crystal {{belonging to}} the P21/c space group, and with a density of 1.486gcm−3. Looking at the ORTEP diagram {{of the structure of}} the cation (at right), it is evident that it possesses the typical geometry expected of a rhodocene or rhodocenium cation. The two cyclopentadienyl rings are close to parallel (the centroid–Rh–centroid angle is 177.2°) and the rhodium centre is slightly closer to the substituted cyclopentadienyl ring (Rh–centroid distances are 1.819Å and 1.795Å), an observation attributed to the greater inductive effect of the tert-butyl groups on the substituted ligand. The ORTEP diagram shows that the cation adopts an eclipsed conformation in the solid state. The crystal structure of the hexafluorophosphate salt shows three crystallographically independent cations, one eclipsed, one staggered, and one which is rotationally disordered. This suggests that the conformation adopted is dependent on the anion present and also that the energy barrier to rotation is low – in <b>ferrocene,</b> the rotational energy barrier is known to be ~5kJmol−1 in both solution and gas phase.|$|E

40|$|Metallocenes {{and their}} most {{important}} derivative, <b>ferrocenes,</b> are important building blocks {{in many areas of}} modern organic chemistry due to their unique electronic and steric properties. <b>Ferrocenes</b> are predominantly used in catalysis, however, nowadays they have also found application in material science and pharmaceutical products showing the enormous potential of this class of molecules. In this thesis a concept for the asymmetric synthesis of 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituted and 1, 3 -disubstituted mono- and di-ferrocenyls was developed. The flexible substitution pattern allows for rapid and simple ferrocenyl-ligand fine-tuning in a given catalytic asymmetric process. Starting from several ferrocenyl-SAMP-hydrazones, different donor functionalities were diastereoselectivly introduced using a second ortho-directing group. Furthermore the exchange of the auxiliary by electrophiles gave rise to more structurally-unique ligands...|$|R
40|$|Reactions of the vinylalkylidene {{complexes}} [Fe 2 μ-η 1 :η 3 -CRCHCH(NMe 2) (μ-CO) (CO) (Cp) 2] (R = SiMe 3, 1 a; Tol, 1 b; CO 2 Me, 1 c, Tol = 4 -MeC 6 H 4) with HC≡CR′ (R′ = CPh 2 OH, CO 2 Me, Ph) lead to {{the formation}} of a mixture of 1, 3 -disubstituted <b>ferrocenes</b> [1 -R- 3 -R′-Fc] (5, 7, 9, 11) and 1, 2, 4 -trisubstituted <b>ferrocenes</b> [1 -NMe 2 - 2 -R′- 4 -R-Fc] (4, 6, 8, 10) (R = SiMe 3, R′ = CPh 2 OH, 4 and 5; R = SiMe 3, R′ = CO 2 Me, 6 and 7; R = SiMe 3, R′ = Ph, 8 and 9; R = Tol, R′ = CPh 2 OH, 10 and 11). The polysubstituted Cp ring of the ferrocenyl products results from the cycloaddition of the alkyne with the bridging vinylalkylidene ligand and involves the cleavage of one of the two substituents (H or NMe 2) on the vinyl moiety, {{as well as of the}} Fe−Fe bond. The cycloaddition reaction has been extended to a variety of bridging vinylalkylidene diiron complexes with different substituents and functionalities on the C 3 bridging ligand, and to different alkynes. Thus, the vinylalkylidene complex 1 b reacts with HC≡CPh, yielding a mixture of four different <b>ferrocenes,</b> due to the absence of regioselectivity in the alkyne cycloaddition: [1 -NMe 2 - 2 -Ph- 4 -Tol-Fc] (12), [1 -Tol- 3 -Ph-Fc] (13), [1 -NMe 2 - 3 -Ph- 4 -Tol-Fc] (14), and [1 -Tol- 2 -Ph-Fc] (15). Conversely, the reactions with symmetric alkynes do not produce regioisomers: treatment of 1 b and 1 c with R′C≡CR′ (R′ = Et, Ph) affords a mixture of 1, 2, 3 -trisubstituted <b>ferrocenes</b> [1 -R- 2 -R′- 3 -R′-Fc] (17, 19, 21, 23) and tetrasubstituted <b>ferrocenes</b> [1 -NMe 2 - 2 -R′- 3 -R′- 4 -R-Fc] (16, 18, 20, 22) (R = SiMe 3, R′ = Et, 16 and 17; R = Tol, R′ = Et, 18 and 19; R = Tol, R′ = Ph, 20 and 21; R = CO 2 Me, R′ = Ph, 22 and 23). Likewise, the vinylalkylidene complexes [Fe 2 μ-η 1 :η 3 -C(X) CHCH(R) (μ-CO) (CO) (Cp) 2] (R = CO 2 Me, X = NMe 2, 2 a; R = CN, X = NMe 2, 2 b; R = CO 2 Me, X = SMe, 3 a; R = CN, X = SMe, 3 b) react with alkynes HC≡CR′ (R′ = Tol, Ph), yielding a mixture of trisubstituted <b>ferrocenes</b> [1 -X- 2 -R′- 4 -R-Fc] (24, 26, 28) and [1 -X- 3 -R′- 4 -R-Fc] (25, 27, 29) (X = NMe 2, R = CO 2 Me, R′ =Tol, 24 and 25; X = NMe 2, R = CN, R′ =Tol, 26 and 27; X = SMe, R = CO 2 Me, R′ = Ph, 28 and 29). Finally, the reactions of 2 a and 3 b with PhC≡CPh afford the tetrasubstituted <b>ferrocenes</b> 22 and [1 -SMe- 2 -Ph- 3 -Ph- 4 -CN-Fc] (30), respectively. The crystal structures of 4 and 11 have been determined by X-ray diffraction studies...|$|R

25|$|Ferrocenium salts are {{sometimes}} used as oxidizing agents, {{in part because}} the product <b>ferrocene</b> is fairly inert and readily separated from ionic products.
