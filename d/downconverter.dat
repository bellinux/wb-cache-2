25|$|Satellite {{television}} {{is a system}} of supplying television programming using broadcast signals relayed from communication satellites. The signals are received via an outdoor parabolic reflector antenna usually {{referred to as a}} satellite dish and a low-noise block <b>downconverter</b> (LNB). A satellite receiver then decodes the desired television programme for viewing on a television set. Receivers can be external set-top boxes, or a built-in television tuner. Satellite television provides a wide range of channels and services, especially to geographic areas without terrestrial television or cable television.|$|E
2500|$|At the {{microwave}} frequencies {{used in many}} parabolic antennas, [...] waveguide is required to conduct {{the microwave}}s between the feed antenna and transmitter or receiver. [...] Because of {{the high cost of}} waveguide runs, in many parabolic antennas the RF front end electronics of the receiver is located at the feed antenna, and the received signal is converted to a lower intermediate frequency (IF) so it can be conducted to the receiver through cheaper coaxial cable. [...] This is called a Low-noise block <b>downconverter.</b> [...] Similarly, in transmitting dishes, the microwave transmitter may be located at the feed point.|$|E

40|$|We {{present the}} status of our work {{implementing}} a single photon on-demand source based on a multiplexed arrangement of parametric <b>downconverters.</b> An array of <b>downconverters</b> with multiplexed outputs {{makes it possible to}} create light pulses with increased probability of containing a single photon, while suppressing the probability of producing more than one photon. This is crucial for quantum cryptographic applications. Our current setup implements the scheme in a greatly simplified manner that produces photons along with a measure of the likelihood that the light pulse emitted is just a single photon. This implementation uses a virtual array of <b>downconverters</b> and an array of staggered length optical fibers allowing a single detector to measure a herald photon output by a series of <b>downconverters.</b> This single detector arrangement is a great savings considering the cost of such detectors. The timing of the herald tells us which path the herald took, which in turn, provides information on the single vs. multiphoton probabilities. So far, our work shows that the individual correlated photon peaks are clearly resolvable with our 2. 4 ns delay line steps and the 1 ns full width half maximum (FWHM) of the correlated photon peaks, and that we can observe four correlated photon peaks simultaneously, a requirement to fully implement our scheme. Our current efforts are to increase the brightness and utility of the system for incorporation into a quantum communication testbed...|$|R

30|$|Research on {{spectral}} conversion {{is focused}} on organic dyes, quantum dots, lanthanide ions, and transition metal ion systems for up- and downconversion [13, 17, 18]. An upconversion layer is to be placed {{at the back of}} the solar cells, and by converting part of the transmitted photons to wavelengths that can be absorbed, it is relatively easy to identify a positive contribution from the upconversion layer, even if the upconversion efficiency is low. In contrast, proof-of-principle experiments in solar cells are complicated for <b>downconverters</b> and downshifters because of the likelihood of competing non-radiative processes. These <b>downconverters</b> and downshifters have to be placed at the front of the solar cell, and any efficiency loss will reduce the overall efficiency of the system.|$|R
