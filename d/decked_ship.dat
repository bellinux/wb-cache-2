2500|$|The force {{assembled}} outside Boulogne {{in later}} September, under the overall command of Lord Keith aboard his flagship [...] There {{to witness the}} operation were Lord Melville and Fulton. Fulton had negotiated a sum of £40,000 for the first <b>decked</b> <b>ship</b> destroyed in the attack, and half the value of any ship destroyed, {{on top of his}} salary of £200 a month. However Keith made no attempt to conceal the British force, and the French were alerted that an attack could be imminent. By 9pm on the night of 2 October the wind and tide were judged right and the flotilla began to approach the harbour.|$|E
60|$|Some {{thousands}} of years ago there was a city in Mesopotamia called Surippak. One night a strange dream came to a dweller therein, whose name, if rightly reported, was Hasisadra. The dream foretold the speedy coming of a great flood; and it warned Hasisadra to lose no time in building a ship, in which, when notice was given, he, his family and friends, with their domestic animals and a collection of wild creatures and seed of plants of the land, might take refuge and be rescued from destruction. Hasisadra awoke, and at once acted upon the warning. A strong <b>decked</b> <b>ship</b> was built, and her sides were paid, inside and out, with the mineral pitch, or bitumen, with which the country abounded; the vessel's seaworthiness was tested, the cargo was stowed away, and a trusty pilot or steersman appointed.|$|E
50|$|During {{his absence}} {{some of his}} old {{officers}} of Investigator—among whom, besides Robert Fowler, were Samuel Flinders and John Franklin—superintended {{the building of a}} small, <b>decked</b> <b>ship,</b> which was named Resource. On being manned she was placed in charge of Denis Lacy, formerly master's mate of Investigator.|$|E
5000|$|... "Carthage {{each day}} {{produced}} {{one hundred and}} forty finished shields, three hundred swords, five hundred spears, and one thousand missiles for the catapults... Furthermore, although surrounded by the Romans built one hundred and twenty <b>decked</b> <b>ships</b> in two months... for old timber had been stored away in readiness, {{and a large number}} of skilled workmen, maintained at public expense." ...|$|R
50|$|The Illyrians, now {{reinforced}} by 7 <b>decked</b> <b>ships</b> {{sent by the}} Acarnanians {{in compliance with the}} terms of their treaty, encountered the Achaean fleet off the island of Paxos. The Acarnanians and those Achaean ships which were told off to engage them fought with no advantage on either side, remaining undamaged in their encounter except for wounds inflicted on some of the crew.|$|R
50|$|Pyrrhus {{added the}} fleet of Syracuse {{to his own}} fleet. Syracuse possessed over 120 <b>decked</b> <b>ships,</b> 20 without decks and a royal enneres, {{increasing}} his fleet to more than 200 ships. Heracleides, the ruler of Leontini delivered his city and army of 4,000 infantry and 500 cavalry to him as well. After receiving many other Sicilian cities in alliance, he hoped he might even conquer Libya.|$|R

5000|$|The Revenue Marine and the Revenue Cutter Service, as it {{was known}} {{variously}} throughout the late 18th and the 19th centuries, referred to its ships as cutters. The term is English in origin and refers to {{a specific type of}} vessel, namely, [...] "a small, <b>decked</b> <b>ship</b> with one mast and bowsprit, with a gaff mainsail on a boom, a square yard and topsail, and two jibs or a jib and a staysail." [...] With general usage, that term came to define any vessel of the United Kingdom's HM Customs and Excise and the term was adopted by the U.S. Treasury Department at the creation of what would become the Revenue Marine. Since that time, no matter what the vessel type, the service has referred to its vessels with permanently assigned crews as cutters.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most likely}} {{origin of the}} term {{goes back to the}} wooden <b>decked</b> <b>ships</b> of the Royal Navy during the late 17th or early 18th century. Barefooted seamen had to stand at {{attention}} for inspection and had to line up on deck along the seams of the wooden planks, hence to [...] "toe the line". The first mention of this use in literature stems from a story about navy life widely published in 1831 and written by Captain Basil Hall RN. Hall served in the Royal Navy from 1802.|$|R
50|$|The Illyrian army {{landed on}} the island and laid siege to the city. Upon this the Corcyreans, in the utmost {{distress}} and despondency, sent, together with the peoples of Apollonia and Epidamnos, envoys to the Achaeans and Aetolians, imploring them to hasten to their relief and not allow them to be driven from their home by the Illyrians. The two Leagues, after listening to the envoys, consented to their request, and both joined in manning the 10 <b>decked</b> <b>ships</b> belonging to the Achaeans. In a few days they were ready and sailed for Corcyra in a hope of raising the siege.|$|R
5000|$|Corcyra {{remained}} {{a member of}} the Epirote League until 255 BC when it regained independence after the death of Alexander II, last King of Epirus. In 229 BC, following a Greek defeat in the naval battle of Paxos, the city suffered a short-lived occupation by Illyrians under the command of Demetrius of Pharos. Polybius wrote the background of this incident, in that same year [...] "When the season for sailing had come, Queen Teuta sent out a larger fleet of piratical galleys than ever against the Greek shores, some of which sailed straight for Corcyra...." [...] Another part of the fleet which had sailed for Epidamnius being repulsed went also [...] "there, to the terror of the inhabitants, they disembarked and set about besieging the town...the Corcyreans...sent off envoys to the Achaean and Aetolian leagues, begging for instant help...ten <b>decked</b> <b>ships</b> of war belonging to the Achaeans were manned...fitted out in a few days, set sail for Corcyra in hopes of raising the siege." [...] However, [...] "the Illyrians obtained a reinforcement of seven <b>decked</b> <b>ships</b> from the Acarnanians" [...] engaging off the island of Paxi. Besting the Achaeans, capturing four and sinking one, the remaining five ran back home. [...] "The Illyrians, on the other hand, filled with self-confidence by their success, continued their siege of Corcyra in high spirits...while the Corcyreans, reduced to the despair of their safety by what had happened, after sustaining the siege for a short time longer, made terms with the Illyrians, consenting to receive a garrison, and with it Demetrius of Pharos." ...|$|R
60|$|Presently after, {{these two}} set forth and descended to the harbour. It was a {{considerable}} basin, lying among sand hills, and surrounded with patches of down, ancient ruinous lumber, and tumble-down slums of the town. Many <b>decked</b> <b>ships</b> and many open boats either lay there at anchor, {{or had been}} drawn up on the beach. A long duration of bad weather had driven them from the high seas into {{the shelter of the}} port; and the great trooping of black clouds, and the cold squalls that followed one another, now with a sprinkling of dry snow, now in a mere swoop of wind, promised no improvement but rather threatened a more serious storm in the immediate future.|$|R
5000|$|Agesimbrotus (Gr. [...] ) was the {{commander}} of the Rhodian fleet, consisting of 20 <b>decked</b> <b>ships,</b> during the Second Macedonian War, and sailed against Philip of Macedon from 200 to 197 BC. [...] Agesimbrotus' fleet met with the 24 quinqueremes of Attalus I near Andros, and the two sailed for Euboea, and ravaged the lands belonging to Carystus. When that city received reinforcements from Chalcis, the fleets diverted to Eretria rather than engage a more prepared enemy. There they united with the fleet of Roman admiral Lucius Quinctius Flamininus, and the three of them laid heavy siege to Eretria, which surrendered after a nighttime assault by Quinctius. [...] The three commanders sailed back to Carystus, which evacuated into the city citadel at the approach of such a fleet, and sent ambassadors to beg protection from Quinctius. The townspeople were freed and the Macedonian garrison was ransomed and deported, unarmed, to Boeotia.|$|R
50|$|In 217 BC, Scerdilaidas ceased {{his support}} for Philip V, {{maintaining}} that a promised subsidy was unpaid and long overdue. He dispatched 15 ships, ostensibly to collect and escort the payment, but at the island of Leucas south of Corcyra his forces killed two of Philip's Corinthian allies and seized their four ships. Scerdilaidas' fleet then sailed south and began to plunder shipping around Cape Malea in the southern Peloponnese. In response, Philip prepared a strong naval force of twelve <b>decked</b> <b>ships,</b> eight open vessels and thirty hemioliae, which headed south at full speed to deal with Scerdilaidas. This counter attack by Philip was too slow and missed its targets. Scerdilaidas went on to march into Dassaretia, taking several cities and invading parts of western Macedonia. He looted Pissaeum in Pelagonia and overran some frontier districts of Macedon. Before the winter Philip had occupied the area of Lyncestis, cutting off the direct route from Illyria, and extended his power to Dassaretia. Philip was planning an invasion of Illyria. However, in doing so, he would face not only the lembi of Scerdilaidas, but also the heavier warships of the Roman navy.|$|R
60|$|In {{the corner}} of the ground stood a <b>decked</b> mimic <b>ship,</b> with real masts, yards, and sails--mainmast seventy feet high. At the word of command from the Skipper of this ship--a mahogany-faced Old Salt, with the {{indispensable}} quid in his cheek, the true nautical roll, and all wonderfully complete--the rigging was covered with a swarm of boys: one, the first to spring into the shrouds, outstripping all the others, and resting on the truck of the main- topmast in no time.|$|R
50|$|Not long {{afterward}} Polyxenidas and the Romans had a naval engagement near Myonessus, {{in which the}} former had ninety <b>decked</b> <b>ships,</b> and Regillus, the Roman admiral, eighty-three, of which twenty-five were from Rhodes. The latter were ranged by their commander, Eudorus, on the left wing. Seeing Polyxenidas on the other wing extending his line much beyond that of the Romans, and fearing lest it should be surrounded, he sailed rapidly around there with his swift ships and experienced oarsmen, and brought his fire-ships against Polyxenidas first, scattering flames everywhere. The ships of the latter did not dare to meet their assailants {{on account of the}} fire, but, sailing round and round, tried to keep out of the way, shipped much water, and were exposed to ramming behind the bows. Presently a Rhodian ship struck a Sidonian, and the blow being severe the anchor of the latter was dislodged and stuck in the former, fastening them together. The two ships being immovable the contest between the crews became like a land fight. As many others hastened to the aid of each, the competition on both sides became spirited, and the Roman ships broke through the Antiochean line of battle, which was exposed in this way, and surrounded the enemy before they knew it. When they discovered it there was a flight and a pursuit. Twenty-nine of the Antiochean ships were lost, thirteen of which were captured with their crews. The Romans lost only two vessels. Polyxenidas captured the Rhodian ship and brought it to Ephesus.|$|R
5000|$|The liburnian (liburna, λιβυρνίς, libyrnis) was {{a variant}} of lembos invented by the tribe of the Liburnians. Initially used for piracy and scouting, this light and swift vessel {{was adopted by the}} Romans during the Illyrian Wars, and {{eventually}} became the mainstay of the fleets of the Roman Empire following Actium, displacing the heavier vessels. Especially the provincial Roman fleets were composed almost exclusively of liburnians. [...] Livy, Lucan and Appian all describe the liburnian as bireme; they were fully <b>decked</b> (cataphract) <b>ships,</b> with a sharply pointed prow, providing a more streamlined shape designed for greater speed. In terms of speed, the liburnian was probably considerably slower than a trireme, but on a par with a [...] "five".|$|R
25|$|SS Clan Ranald was a two <b>decked,</b> turret deck <b>ship,</b> that sank off {{the rocky}} coast near Edithburgh in Australia. It {{is the only}} turret ship to have been lost in Australian waters, and {{therefore}} represents a unique part of Australia's maritime history. The bulk of crew were Asian sailors (lascars). Clan Ranald {{is considered one of}} the worst shipwrecks in South Australia (SA) where only 24 survived out of the 64 crew members.|$|R
50|$|Cross-deck (or cross-decking) is naval jargon {{which may}} refer to either informal, ad-hoc sharing of {{resources}} between naval vessels (historical usage), {{or the use}} of carrier decks (or vessel borne helipads) to host aircraft of foreign allies, aircraft from other ships in the same navy, or as re-fueling platforms for naval aircraft to extend flight operations beyond the range of the aircraft type. The operations may be entirely within a single navy, or between allied navies such as defined in the HOSTAC agreement. This may be required for ferrying aircraft or supplies, power projection operations involving fixed or rotary-wing aircraft, or to provide flexibility in operating limited numbers of specialized aircraft (such as the EA-6B Prowler electronic warfare aircraft) over a wide theatre of operations. Spare parts that can be lifted by helicopter are often crossed <b>decked</b> between <b>ships</b> operating compatible equipment (especially if they are the same ship class), to reduce redundancy in carrying spares.|$|R
50|$|The Ming dynasty of the 17th {{century had}} relaxed its age old {{practice}} of banning maritime trade, allowing the Chinese coast to bustle with commercial activity. The Ming navy, however, had been poorly maintained and ineffectual, such that pirates had practically controlled this trade. The pirate leader Zheng Zhilong in particular dominated the Fujian coast, his <b>ships</b> <b>decked</b> with European cannons and mercenaries from Japan to Africa. The Ming court, in its decline, recruited Zheng Zhilong in 1628 {{rather than to}} try and destroy him. Although the more piratical elements of his fleet deserted him after he surrendered to the Ming, Zheng's new status as a Ming admiral allowed him to go after his former lieutenants. He was aided in this anti-pirate campaign by the Dutch under the governor of Formosa (Taiwan), Hans Putmans.|$|R
