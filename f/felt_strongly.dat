5|$|Ross <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> {{that the}} state should {{adequately}} care for its veterans. During his first term, the first Confederate home in Texas was dedicated in Austin. Within two years, the facility {{had run out of}} room, so Ross served as chairman of a committee to finance a relocation to a larger facility. By August 1890, the home had collected enough money to move to a larger location.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to eschew scripts for storyboards {{is one that}} Hillenburg made {{early on in the}} series' development. Rocko's Modern Life had also used storyboarding, and having worked on that series, Hillenburg <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> about adopting the process for SpongeBob SquarePants— even though Nickelodeon was beginning to show greater preference for script-driven cartoons. Another writer for the series, Merriwether Williams, described in an interview that she and Mr. Lawrence would write a draft for an episode in an afternoon and be done at 4 o'clock.|$|E
5|$|At {{the same}} time, a few on Capitol Hill were {{determined}} to overhaul United States Special Operations Forces. They included Senators Sam Nunn (D-GA) and William Cohen (R-ME), both members of the Armed Services Committee, and Representative Dan Daniel (D-VA), {{the chairman of the}} United States House Armed Services Subcommittee on Readiness. Congressman Daniel had become convinced that the U.S. military establishment was not interested in special operations, that the country's capability in this area was second rate, and that SOF operational command and control was an endemic problem. Senators Nunn and Cohen also <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> that the Department of Defense was not preparing adequately for future threats. Senator Cohen agreed that the U.S. needed a clearer organizational focus and chain of command for special operations to deal with low-intensity conflicts.|$|E
50|$|The {{earthquake}} was <b>strongly</b> <b>felt</b> {{across the}} island of Sumatra and caused widespread power outages in the Indonesian city of Banda Aceh, already devastated by the December 2004 tsunami, and prompted thousands to flee their homes and seek higher ground. It was <b>strongly</b> <b>felt</b> along {{the west coast of}} Thailand and Malaysia, and in Kuala Lumpur high-rise buildings were evacuated. The earthquake was <b>felt</b> less <b>strongly</b> in the Maldives, India, and Sri Lanka.|$|R

5|$|Elected {{with support}} from the Farmers' Alliance {{and as a result of}} {{agricultural}} protest, Tillman was thought likely to join the Populists in their challenge to the established parties. Tillman refused, and generally opposed Populist positions that went beyond his program of increasing access to higher education and reform of the Democratic Party (white supremacy was not a Populist position). The Alliance (and Populists) demanded a system of subtreasuries under the federal government, that could accept farmers' crops and advance them 80 percent of the value interest-free. Tillman, not wanting more federal officeholders in the state (that in Republican administrations might be filled by African Americans), initially opposed the proposal. Many farmers <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> about this issue, and in 1891, Tillman was censured by the state Alliance for his opposition. Attuned to political necessities, Tillman gradually came to support the subtreasuries in time for his re-election campaign in 1892, though he was never an active proponent.|$|E
5|$|In 1992, Boisselier {{converted}} to Raëlism, a UFO religion {{founded by the}} French journalist Claude Vorilhon, usually known as Raël, in 1973. After attending a meeting at which Raël spoke, she <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> that he was completely honest and joined his movement. She had left her husband, alleging violent behavior, shortly before her conversion; afterwards, owing to her involvement with Raëlism, he gained sole custody of their youngest child. Boisselier believed that religious intolerance motivated a court to transfer the child's custody. Although her faith led to tension with her parents, her eldest child converted. In the 1990s, Raëlism was seen as dangerous and viewed with disdain in France, resulting in loss of employment for prominent members. The hostility was fueled in part by public concerns about new religious movements after deaths caused by the Order of the Solar Temple in Europe during the mid-1990s.|$|E
5|$|During the 12th and 13th centuries, the English {{began to}} {{consider}} themselves {{superior to the}} Welsh, Scots and Bretons. The English perceived themselves as civilised, economically prosperous and properly Christian, while the Celtic fringe was considered lazy, barbarous and backward. Following the invasion of Ireland in the late 12th century, similar feelings were expressed about the Irish, with the distinctions clarified and reinforced in 14th-century English legislation. The English also <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> about the foreign traders {{who lived in the}} special enclaves in London in the Late Middle Ages; the position of the Jews is described below, but Italian and Baltic traders were also regarded as aliens and were frequently the targets of violence during economic downturns. Even within England, different identities abounded, each with their own sense of status and importance. Regional identities could be important - men and women from Yorkshire, for example, had a clear identity within English society, and professional groups with a distinct identity, such as lawyers, engaged in open fighting with others in cities such as London.|$|E

5|$|Plans {{called for}} Hubble to be {{serviced}} in February 2005, but the Columbia disaster in 2003, {{in which the}} orbiter disintegrated on re-entry into the atmosphere, had wide-ranging effects on the Hubble program. NASA Administrator Sean O'Keefe decided that all future shuttle missions {{had to be able}} to reach the safe haven of the International Space Station should in-flight problems develop. As no shuttles were capable of reaching both HST and the ISS during the same mission, future crewed service missions were canceled. This decision was assailed by numerous astronomers, who felt that Hubble was valuable enough to merit the human risk. HST's planned successor, the James Webb Telescope (JWST), was not expected to launch until at least 2018. A gap in space-observing capabilities between a decommissioning of Hubble and the commissioning of a successor was of major concern to many astronomers, given the significant scientific impact of HST. The consideration that JWST will not be located in low Earth orbit, and therefore cannot be easily upgraded or repaired in the event of an early failure, only makes these concerns more acute. On the other hand, many astronomers <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> that the servicing of Hubble should not take place if the expense were to come from the JWST budget.|$|E

25|$|The {{earthquake}} {{occurred at}} 20:45, being <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> in Bucharest and also {{all over the}} country up to Lviv, Sevastopol, Constantinople (Istanbul), Odessa, etc. A detailed report on the phenomenon was promptly done by Güstav Schuller, mining geologist {{in the service of the}} Duke of Saxony.

25|$|De Valera led his {{supporters}} {{out of the}} Dáil and, after a lapse of six months in which the IRA also split, a bloody civil war between pro- and anti-treaty sides followed, only {{coming to an end}} in 1923 accompanied by multiple executions.

25|$|In males, orgasm {{is usually}} {{associated}} with ejaculation. Each ejection is accompanied with continuous pulses of sexual pleasure, especially in the penis and loins. Other sensations may be <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> among the lower spine, or lower back. The first and second convulsions are usually the most intense in sensation, and produce the greatest quantity of semen. Thereafter, each contraction {{is associated with a}} diminishing volume of semen and a milder sensation of pleasure.|$|E
25|$|Free Blacks in the South widely {{believed}} that all land would be redistributed {{to those who}} had worked on it. They also <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> that they had a right to own this land. Many expected this event to occur by Christmas 1865 or New Year's 1866 Although the freedpeople formed this belief in response to the policies of the Freedmen's Bureau and Circular #13, their hopes were soon downplayed as superstition akin to belief in Santa Claus.|$|E

25|$|The geocentric {{model was}} {{eventually}} {{replaced by the}} heliocentric model. The earliest heliocentric model, Copernican heliocentrism, could remove Ptolemy's epicycles because the retrograde motion could {{be seen to be}} the result of the combination of Earth and planet movement and speeds. Copernicus <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> that equants were a violation of Aristotelian purity, and proved that replacement of the equant with a pair of new epicycles was entirely equivalent. Astronomers often continued using the equants instead of the epicycles because the former was easier to calculate, and gave the same result.|$|E

Neither {{of the two}} was convicted of premeditated murder. They were sentenced to 8 and 17 years in prison, respectively. However both sentences personally ordered appealed by attorney general Tor-Aksel Busch who <b>felt</b> <b>strongly</b> that the court had made the wrong decision, and during the second trial, both men were convicted of premeditated murder and kidnapping and had their sentences increased to 19 years for Khan and 18 years for Nyfløt. In addition, both men were to pay NOK 200.000 in compensation to Ashraf's parents.|$|E
