On 13 October Ban announced that veteran UN diplomat Sigrid Kaag would head the joint UN-OPCW mission.|$|E

5|$|After Christmas {{leave the}} company {{concentrated}} at Balcombe in Victoria {{where it was}} officially disbanded on 20 April 1945, {{although many of the}} men continued to serve in other signals units {{until the end of the}} war. Although complete records were unable to be maintained, a nominal roll of the unit lists the names of approximately 792 men that served in the NGAWW. During its service, the unit lost eight men killed in action, while another three died of other causes while on active service. The company had the distinction of being Australia's most highly decorated signals unit of World War II, with its members receiving one Member of the Order of the British Empire, ten Military Medals, and ten Mentions in Despatches. Numerous Commendation Cards were also awarded by the Commander-In-Chief. Flight Lieutenant Leigh Vial (then an RAAF pilot officer working as a Coastwatcher) was also awarded the US Distinguished Service Cross for service behind the lines around Salamaua during a <b>joint</b> <b>mission</b> with NGAWW personnel.|$|E
5|$|It was Warelwast {{who told}} Anselm in 1103 {{that the king}} would not permit his return to England. This came after a failed <b>joint</b> <b>mission</b> by Warelwast and Anselm to Paschal {{attempting}} to resolve the dispute between Henry and the archbishop over the king's investiture of bishops, a dispute generally known as the Investiture Controversy. It is quite likely that the king had given instructions that if the mission failed, Warelwast was to inform Anselm that he should only to return to England if he agreed with the king's position in the dispute. In 1106 Warelwast was the king's negotiator in the discussions {{that led to the}} settlement of the Investiture Controversy in England. The king ultimately lost little, relinquishing the right to actually give the symbols of episcopal authority to a newly elected bishop in return for continuing to receive homage from the bishops. Early in 1106 Warelwast was sent to Bec Abbey, where Anselm was residing in exile, to inform him of the settlement and deliver to the archbishop the king's invitation to return to England. In May 1107 Warelwast acted as the king's envoy at Paschal's council at Troyes, where Paschal was attempting to secure support for Bohemond of Antioch's proposed campaign against Byzantium. Warelwast probably relayed to the pope the news that King Henry would make no contribution to Bohemond's efforts.|$|E

40|$|Problem Statement: English {{learning}} and teaching activities are crucial for Turkish Gendarmerie personnel serving {{both at home and}} in various regions of the world. However, there is no sound basis determining the language needs of the gendarmerie organization and personnel to lead them to accomplishment in <b>joint</b> <b>missions.</b> Purpose of Study: This paper aims to investigate the language needs of the Turkish Gendarmerie in terms of English for Specific Purposes. It is expected that determining the language needs of the organization on scientific basis helps to reshape the language curriculum of the gendarmerie and finally it will help the accomplishment of the <b>joint</b> <b>missions</b> in terms of language proficiency. Method: Two questionnaires were administered to 70 gendarmerie personnel who had English learning experience to understand the language needs of the organization. Then the collected data was presented through tables. Findings and Results: The data collected reveals that speaking and writing skills should be emphasized and taken into consideration in assessment. In addition, language materials need to be improved or be supplemented by auxiliary documents. Conclusion and Recommendations: The present study suggests that some steps need to be taken to improve the language proficiency of the gendarmerie personnel to meet the language requirements especially for <b>joint</b> <b>missions.</b> A new language teaching program should be prepared in terms of improving four language skills and topics should be introduced related to the gendarmerie jurisdiction...|$|R

25|$|Originally it was {{intended}} that Tereshkova would launch first in Vostok 5 while Ponomaryova would follow her into orbit in Vostok 6. However, this flight plan was altered in March 1963.

The State Space Commission nominated Tereshkova to pilot Vostok 6 at their meeting on 21 May and this was confirmed by Nikita Khrushchev himself.

25|$|China has a {{space program}} with an {{independent}} human spaceflight capability. It {{has developed a}} sizable family of successful Long March rockets. It has launched two lunar orbiters, Chang'e 1 and Chang'e 2. On 2 December 2013, China launched a modified Long March 3B rocket, with Chang'e 3 Moon lander and its rover Yutu on-board toward the Moon and successfully performed soft landing and rover operations, becoming the third country to do so. It also has plans to retrieve samples by late 2017. In 2011, China embarked on a program to establish a manned space station, starting with the launch of Tiangong 1 and followed by Tiangong 2 in 2016.
