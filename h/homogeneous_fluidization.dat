A fully predictive criterion for the stability of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> state is here proposed, based on the well-known Wallis’ linear stability analysis. The criterion requires the choice of an appropriate averaging distance, which in the present development is found to be bed-voidage dependent.

A detailed investigation is carried out on pressure fluctuations, porosity distribution, and bubble and solids flow characteristics. At high pressure, the porosity distribution is <b>homogeneous</b> and <b>fluidization</b> is smooth. The bubble size depends upon the location in the 3 D bed, showing different trends at different pressures. The average bubble size is reduced {{with an increase in}} pressure, caused by a difference in coalescence and splitting of bubbles. An initial increase in pressure from 1 to 2 bar shows an increase in bubble rise velocity, but a further increase in pressure causes bubbles to rise more slowly.

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} a {{numerical}} study of fluidization behavior of Geldart A particles by use of a 2 D soft-sphere discrete particle model (DPM).

An anisotropy of the velocity fluctuation of particles is found in both the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> regime and the bubbling regime. The <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> is shown to represent a transition phase resulting from the competition of three kinds of basic interactions: the fluid¨Cparticle interaction, the particle¨Cparticle collisions (and particle¨Cwall collisions) and the interparticle van der Waals forces. In the bubbling regime, however, the effect of the interparticle van der Waals forces vanishes and the fluid¨Cparticle interaction becomes the dominant factor determining the fluidization behavior of Geldart A particles.

40|$|Fluidization {{is widely}} used in powder {{processes}} due to its continuous powder handling ability, good fluid-solid contacting, high heat and mass transfer coefficients, and high rates of reaction. However, particles smaller than 20 microns are commonly very difficult to fluidize since these powders will generally form channels, “rat holes ” or lift as a solid plug when exposed to the fluidizing medium.

40|$|The EMMS/bubbling drag model {{takes the}} effects of meso-scale {{structures}} (i. e. bubbles) into modeling of drag coefficient and thus improves coarse-grid simulation of bubbling and turbulent fluidized beds. However, its dependence on grid size has not been fully investigated. In this article, we adopt a two-step scheme to extend the EMMS/bubbling model to the sub-grid level. Thus the heterogeneity index, H-D, which accounts for the hydrodynamic disparity between <b>homogeneous</b> and heterogeneous <b>fluidization,</b> can be correlated {{as a function of}} both local voidage and slip velocity. Simulations over a periodic domain show the new drag model is less sensitive to grid size because of the additional dependence on local slip velocity. When applying the new drag model to simulations of realistic bubbling and turbulent fluidized beds, we find grid-independent results are easier to obtain for high-velocity turbulent fluidized bed cases. The simulation results indicate that the extended EMMS/bubbling drag model is a potential method for coarse-grid simulations of large-scale fluidized beds. (C) 2017 Elsevier B. V.

40|$|Every {{adherent}} {{eukaryotic cell}} exerts appreciable traction forces upon its substrate. Moreover, every resident cell within the heart, great vessels, bladder, gut or lung routinely experiences large periodic stretches. As an acute {{response to such}} stretches the cytoskeleton can stiffen, increase traction forces and reinforce, as reported by some, or can soften and fluidize, as reported more recently by our laboratory, but in any given circumstance it remains unknown which response might prevail or why. Using a novel nanotechnology, we show here that in loading conditions expected in most physiological circumstances the localized reinforcement response fails to scale up {{to the level of}} <b>homogeneous</b> cell stretch; <b>fluidization</b> trumps reinforcement. Whereas the reinforcement response is known to be mediated by upstream mechanosensing and downstream signaling, results presented here show the fluidization response to be altogether novel: it is a direct physical effect of mechanical force acting upon a structural lattice that is soft and fragile.

However, the relationship between the TFM and EMMS has not been clarified to enable their combination. To solve this problem, we present a structure dependent analysis of mass, momentum and energy conservation equations. This analysis is rooted in the structure dependent multi fluid model (SFM), which details the composition of drag forces and energy consumptions and their relationships with consideration of meso-strucLures. With assumption of homogeneous structures, it reduces to the TEM equations; for steady state systems with structures, it restores the force balance equations, equal pressure drop relation and energy relationship of the EMMS. In future, the scale dependence of this analysis deserves more efforts to understand the applicability of the EMMS stability condition on different scales. (C) 2014 Elsevier Lid. All rights reserved.

40|$|Modeling the hydrodynamics of dense-solid gas flows is {{strongly}} {{affected by the}} wall boundary condition and in particular, the specularity coefficient ϕ which characterizes the tangential momentum transfer from the particles to the wall. The focus {{of this study is}} to investigate the impact of ϕ on the fluidization hydrodynamics using a fully Eulerian description of the solid and gas phases in 3 D cylindrical coordinates. In order to quantify this impact, tools for characterizing the bubbling dynamics and solids circulation are developed and applied to both lab-scale (diameters 10 cm and 14. 5 cm) and pilot-scale (diameter 30 cm) cylindrical beds. Comparison of simulation predictions with experimental data for different fluidization regimes and particle properties suggests that values of ϕ in the range [0. 01, 0. 3] are suitable for simulating most dense solid–gas flows of practical interest. It is also shown that for this range of ϕ, the fluidization hydrodynamics are not significantly dependent on the choice of ϕ especially as the bed diameter is increased. Additionally, 3 D validation of the variable ϕ model by Li and Benyahia [1] shows the bubble diameter predictions to be in excellent agreement with experiment and the average value of ϕ predicted within the range [0. 01, 0. 3]. Quantifying the impact of ϕ and establishing an appropriate range is not only important for accurate simulations at both lab and pilot scales but also validation of models and sub-models for a better understanding of the fluidization phenomenon. Finally, a comparison of the Gidaspow and Syamlal–O'Brien gas–solids drag model shows that the former is more applicable to <b>homogeneous</b> bubbling <b>fluidization</b> (U/U[subscript mf]< 4) while the latter is only suitable for high velocities (U/U[subscript mf]< 4) associated with larger bubbles and slugs.

40|$|The minimum {{bubbling}} velocity, which demarcates the <b>homogeneous</b> and heterogeneous <b>fluidization</b> regimes, plays {{a pivotal}} role in gas fluidization of Geldart A particles. We systematically study the effect of gas and particle properties on the minimum bubbling velocity of Geldart A particles in gas-fluidized beds using both Eulerian–Eulerian and Eulerian–Lagrangian models. We find that the minimum bubbling velocities as obtained from the simulations are in reasonable agreement with the well-known experimental correlation of Abrahamsen and Geldart (Powder Technology, 1980, 26 : 35 – 46). To our best knowledge, {{this is the first time}} that the minimum bubbling velocity is correctly predicted by Eulerian–Eulerian models, without using an artificial ad-hoc modification of the gas–solid interaction force. Furthermore, we have performed a systematic investigation into the effect of the specific method that is used for determining minimum bubbling velocity. Our simulations show that the minimum bubbling velocity that would be obtained from the simulated bed contraction is larger than the one obtained from visual observation, which in its turn exceeds the one obtained from sudden change of standard deviation of pressure drop.

40|$|Hydrodynamic {{characteristics}} of fluidization in conical or tapered beds {{differ from those}} in columnar beds due to the variation of superficial velocity in the axial direction of the beds. In the former, fixed and fluidized regions could coexist and the sharp peaking of the pressure drop could occur, thereby giving rise to a remarkable pressure drop-flow rate hysteresis loop at incipient fluidization. To explore these unique properties, a series of experiments was carried out of homogenous well-mixed ternary mixtures of three different particle sizes at varying compositions in gas-solid tapered fluidized beds with various tapering angles. The tapering angle of the beds {{has been found to}} dramatically affect the beds' behavior. Other hydrodynamic characteristics determined experimentally included the maximum pressure drop, minimum velocity of fluidization, bed fluctuation ratio and bed expansion ratio. The dependence of these quantities on average particle diameter, mass fraction of the ﬁnes in the mixture, bed height and cone angle has been discussed. Based on dimensional analysis, correlations have been developed with the system parameters viz., geometry of tapered bed, particle diameter, static bed height, density of solid and gas and superficial velocity of the fluidizing medium. Correlations have been also been developed for bed fluctuation ratio and bed expansion ratio in gas-solid tapered fluidized bed of ternary mixture of irregular particles using factorial design method. Experimental values of critical fluidization velocities and maximum bed pressure drops have been compared with the developed correlations in literature.

Our experiments with neon reveal a discontinuous transition from heterogeneous fluidization to a highly expanded <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> state. We point out that increasing gas viscosity enhances the coherence of agglomerate swarms, which promotes a local void-splitting mechanism, thus improving the uniformity of fluidization.

The equivalent bubble size obtained from simulations shows a fair agreement with X-ray tomographic measurements. The particle circulation patterns are in fair agreement with the experimental work of Laverman et al. (2012).

40|$|The gas {{fluidization}} behaviour of fine cohesive powders, {{classified as}} Geldart group C, {{is known to}} be characterized by cracks and channels leading to severe non-homogeneities in the bed. Geldart group A particles, on the other hand, are known to show more <b>homogeneous</b> and regular <b>fluidization</b> behaviour. This paper studies the effects of the addition of small proportions of group A on the fluidization behaviour of a group C powder. Differential pressure fluctuations data at a sampling frequency of 200 Hz were recorded for two cases. In the first case, the bed contained only group C powder while in the second case small amounts of group A particles were added to the existing group C powder. Visual/image observations coupled with time series analysis showed that the addition of small proportions of group A particles substantially improved the fluidization behaviour of the bed even at low superficial gas velocities, leading to a more uniform fluidization. Evaluation of mean and standard deviations has shown the advantage of mixing the two powders as it allowed larger pressure fluctuations and smaller standard deviations. Power spectra, on the other hand, showed that unlike group C, for which fluctuations were small in magnitude and broadband in structure, the mixture showed stronger periodic behaviour as result of the attenuation of the small and rapid fluctuations caused by the flow of gas in the cracks and channels. Advanced methods such as the principal component analysis of the embedded trajectories allowed a quantitative comparison between the fluidization behaviour of the two systems. ...|$|R
40|$|Recent Couette-cell shear {{experiments}} of carbopol gels {{have revealed}} {{the formation of}} a transient shear band before reaching the steady state, which is characterized by homogeneous flow. This shear band is observed in the small-gap limit where the shear stress is spatially uniform. An effective-temperature model of the transient shear banding and solid-fluid transition is developed for the small-gap limit. The small-gap model demonstrates the ability of a continuum-constitutive law that is based solely on microstructural rearrangements of the gel to account for this transient behavior, and identifies that it proceeds via two distinct processes. A shear band nucleates and gradually broadens via disordering at the interface of the band. Simultaneously, spatially <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> is induced outside of the shear band where the disorder of the gel grows uniformly.

40|$|Fine {{particles}} agglomerate in the fluidized state due to {{the strength}} of interparticle attractive forces as compared to particle weight. Interparticle adhesion can be largely increased by consolidation stresses applied during powder handling. As a consequence, fragments of the consolidated powder may persist when the powder is fluidized, which gives rise to large agglomerates of strongly adhered particles in fluidization. This history-dependent effect can be minimized by coating the particles with surface additives such as silica nanoparticles. In this paper, we investigate the effect of high consolidation stresses _c previously applied to samples of silica-coated fine particles on their fluidization behavior. Our experimental measurements show that, even though <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> is still observed, the average agglomerate size and fractal dimension of the agglomerates increase as _c is increased. Bed expansion in the fluidized state is hindered by previously applied high consolidations, which we attribute to an increase of the largest stable size of mesoscopic fluid pockets.

40|$|Multiphase {{systems are}} often {{encountered}} in process industry. Widely diffused applications and operations involve the contact between different phases (gas-solid, gasliquid, solid liquid, etc.) for different purposes, such as chemical reactions of physical operations (heat transfer, mass transfer). Multiphase flows are therefore {{one of the}} most frequent applied fields in chemical engineering. The present thesis is aimed at the development of experimental techniques for the investigation of multiphase flow in general, with particular focus on the analysis of gas-solid and gas-liquid systems. Notably, the development of image analysis techniques is the central thread of the present contribution, and it will be shown that the knowledge so far accumulated allowed to obtain considerable results in both fields investigated. The approach to multiphase systems here adopted is based on the development of novel reliable experimental techniques for the assessment of multiphase system properties and subsequent collection of new experimental information through application of the original techniques here developed. The techniques are mainly based on image analysis, they are non-intrusive, capable of securing several properties simultaneously and cost effective. In particular, the expertise in digital image processing was applied to the investigation of two different classes of multiphase systems, i. e. gas-liquid dispersions and dense gas-solid systems (fluidized beds). With reference to gas liquid dispersions, an effective experimental technique for measuring local gas hold-up and interfacial area, as well as bubble size distribution, was developed and subsequently exploited for collecting experimental information. The technique, named Laser Induced Fluorescence with Shadow Analysis for Bubble Sizing (LIF-SABS) is based on laser sheet illumination of the gas-liquid dispersion and synchronized image acquisition, i. e. on equipment typically available within PIV set-ups. With reference to fluidized beds, a digital image analysis technique was developed vi to study the fluidization dynamics of a lab-scale two-dimensional bubbling bed. Several significant bubble properties were simultaneously measured, ranging from overall bed properties to bubble size and bubble velocity distributions. Moreover, since a lack of knowledge exists on the bubbling dynamics of mixed powders, a large experimental campaign was set up to investigate the fluidization behavior of such powder mixtures. In the field of fluidized bed modeling, a novel linear stability criterion for the state of <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> regime was developed, based on a new mathematical model for gas-fluidized beds.

A {{cylindrical}} quartz reactor with an internal diameter of only 1 mm is used for process conditions up to 500 ◦C and 244 bar. In this way, fast, safe, and inherently cheap experimentation is provided. The process that prompted the present work on miniaturization is gasification of biomass and waste streams in hot compressed water (SCWG). Therefore, water is used as fluidizing agent. Properties of the micro-fluid bed such as the minimum fluidization velocity (Umf), the minimum bubbling velocity (Umb), bed expansion, and identification of the fluidization regime are investigated by visual inspection.

40|$|Fluidization of {{pyroclastic}} solids {{has long}} been indicated as one key to explain the enhanced mobility of dense pyroclastic gravity currents and their associated hazard. However {{there is a lack}} of characterization of the actual pattern and extent of fluidization establishing in real pyroclastic flows and some authors still raise arguments about the relevance of fluidization to the mobility of dense pyroclastic gravity currents. The present paper addresses the fluidization of pyroclastic granular solids with a specific focus on the analysis of factors that may promote <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> and retard solids de-aeration and consolidation. These factors include fines content, particle polydispersity and the establishment of shear flow. The influence of fines content and particle polydispersity has been assessed by analyzing the fluidization behaviour of mixtures of pyroclastic solids characterized by different and properly tailored particle size distributions and fines content. Pyroclastic mixtures, extracted from a Neapolitan Yellow Tuff deposit, were nearly homogeneous as to the lithological composition. The experimental campaign has been carried out with a lab-scale segmented fluidization column 120 mm ID. Experiments included quasi-steady fluidization of granular mixtures at variable gas superficial velocity as well as collapse tests from pre-set fluidized states. Results of the collapse tests were independently analyzed by looking at the time-series of the pressure drop across the bed as well as at the bed surface level as a function of time, recorded with a high-speed video camera. The study has been pursued further to analyze the effect of shear on the fluidization behaviour of pyroclastites. To this end the experimental apparatus has been modified and equipped with a rotating cylinder which could be used to impose a given shear rate to the fluidized bed. Shear rates were comparable to those that are likely to establish in real pyroclastic flows. Quasi-steady fluidization experiments and collapse tests were carried out under either stationary or sheared fluidization conditions. We compared the fluidization behaviour of mixtures characterized by different fines contents. Moreover we compared the fluidization behaviour recorded under either stationary or sheared flow conditions. Results of experimental tests highlight that both the presence of a fine fraction and the establishment of shear flow significantly influence the fluidization behaviour of pyroclastic mixtures, promoting <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> of the granular mixtures. The range of gas superficial velocities within which bubble-free fluidization occurs is significantly broadened by the presence of fines, by the polydisperse nature of the mixtures and by the establishment of shear. The de-aeration/consolidation times determined by the collapse tests are correspondingly much longer. Altogether, results of the present study confirm that key features of dense pyroclastic density currents, like the large fines fractional content, the polydisperse nature of the particle size distribution and strongly sheared flow conditions, exert a significant influence on fluidization, promote suppression of bubbling, retard solids de-aeration, enhance the mobility of the solids...|$|E
40|$|A novel gas-solid reactor for {{cohesive}} C-powders such as {{potato starch}} is introduced, designed and characterized, the so-called stirred vibrating fluidized bed. The {{effects of a}} sinusoidal vibration of the gas distributor and/or stirring of the bed are investigated. The fluidization index, bed expansion, torque and visual behaviour of the bed are determined {{as a function of}} air velocity, bed height and moisture content of the starch, stirrer type and speed and vibration frequency and amplitude. For a potato starch bed of 0. 76 m initial height and 0. 288 m diameter with a moisture content W = 13. 1 weight% dry basis, channel formation can be suppressed only if the aerated bed is effectively stirred: With flat stirrer blades this can be realized for stirring speeds above 1. 67 rps provided the interblade distance is below 124 mm. Even then, the bed consists of agglomerates (flocks) of starch. Alternatively, vibration of the gas distributor of the aerated bed at best results in channel elimination in {{the lower part of the}} bed only. Sufficient vibration, however, can destroy starch agglomerates even at the surface of a bed of 0. 76 m. By simultaneously applying both vibration and stirring of the aerated bed, it is possible to eliminate both channelling and starch agglomeration. Even <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> is possible. Optimal combinations of stirring and vibration parameters are reported for various bed heights and moisture contents...|$|E
40|$|Hot wire anemometry used inside air {{fluidized}} beds {{of glass}} (175 mu m), FCC (75 mu m) and silica (85 mu m) powders (Archimedes numbers of 510, 29 and 16, respectively) allowed {{the measurement of}} the time-resolved local heat transfer coefficient. Time averages of this coefficient reproduce the same behaviour found by other authors with different experimental techniques. A stochastic model for the heat transfer rate has been developed on the basic hypothesis that heat transfer fluctuations are due to the continuous renewal of packets of solid particles along the wire. The most relevant simplifying hypothesis is that the contact time between the wire and the packet is much shorter than the characteristic heating time of the packets. With this model, probability density distributions of the heat transfer coefficient are evaluated. Comparison between experimental and theoretical results is fairly good in all experimental conditions relative to fully developed aggregative fluidization. The model is less reliable in conditions of incipient and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization,</b> where the simplifying hypotheses may not apply. Calculated values of packet to particle size ratios, lambda/d(p), are around 8 for glass, between 14 and 36 for FCC and between 17 and 32 for silica. The increasing number of particles inside a packet seems, therefore, to be correlated, on one hand, to the decreasing Archimedes number, and on the other, to an apparently reduced particle mobility of powders belonging to the Group A of the Geldart [D.

40|$|We have {{investigated}} the effect of cohesion and drag models on the bed hydrodynamics of Geldart A particles based on the two-fluid (TF) model. For a high gas velocity U 0 = 0. 03 m/s, we found a transition from the <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> to bubbling fluidization with an increase of the coefficient C 1, {{which is used to}} account for the contribution of cohesion to the excess compressibility. Thus cohesion can {{play a role in the}} bed expansion of Geldart A particles. Apart from cohesion, we have also investigated the influence of the drag models. When using the Wen and Yu drag correlation with an exponent n = 4. 65, we find an under-prediction of the bed expansion at low gas velocities (U 0 = 0. 009 m/s). When using a larger exponent (n = 9. 6), as reported in experimental studies of gas-fluidization, a much better agreement with the experimental bed expansion is obtained. These findings suggest that at low gas velocity, a scale-down of the commonly used drag model is required. On the other hand, a scale-up of the commonly used drag model is necessary at high gas velocity (U 0 = 0. 2 and 0. 06 m/s). We therefore conclude that scaling the drag force represent only an ad hoc way of repairing the deficiencies of the TF model, and that a far more detailed study is required into the origin of the failure of the TF model for simulating fluidized beds of fine powders. © 2008 Chinese Society of Particuology and Institute of Process Engineering, Chinese Academy of Sciences...|$|E
40|$|The Energy Minimization Multi-Scale (EMMS) drag model, using Sauter mean {{particle}} diameter to represent real particle size distribution, {{has proven to be}} effective in improving the accuracy of continuum modeling of gas-solid flow. Nevertheless, mixing and segregation characteristics in circulating fluidized bed (CFB) risers are very important in many situations, which necessitates the explicit consideration of the effects of particle size distribution on the bed hydrodynamics. To this end, an attempt is made to extend the EMMS drag model to binary gas-solid system, where four input parameters that can be obtained from computational fluid dynamics (CFD) simulation, including two slip velocities between gas and each particle phase and two particle concentrations of each phase, are used to solve the proposed EMMS drag model. Heterogeneous indexes, which are used to modify the drag correlation obtained from <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization,</b> are then predicted and fed into multifluid model (MFM) to predict the dynamical behavior of mixing and segregation of binary gas-solid flow in a CEO riser. The effects of different drag force models, kinetic theories and particle-particle drag force models are also systematically evaluated. It was shown that (i) MFM with the proposed EMMS drag model and the kinetic theory developed by Chao et al. (Chemical Engineering Science 2011, 66 : 3605 - 3616) is able to correctly predict the mixing and segregation pattern in the studied riser, while MFM with homogenous drag forces and the simplified kinetic theory available in commercial software FLUENT completely fails; and (ii) with or without particle-particle drag force has a substantial influence upon the particle behavior.

40|$|The {{microscopic}} {{flow structure}} is studied systematically and comprehensively through a visualization {{system in a}} narrow rectangular circulating fluidized bed (CFB) transparent Plexiglas riser with a height of 7. 6 m and {{a cross section of}} 19 mm × 114 mm. A visualization system consisting of a high-speed video camera, a light source, and image processing and analyzing programs is designed and developed to enable the flow structure to be visualized directly and studied quantitatively. FCC particles of 67 μm are used as the bed materials under different operating conditions with superficial gas velocity (Ug) and solids circulation rate (Gs) in the range of 3. 0 - 12. 0 m/s and 50 - 150 kg/m 2 s respectively. To study the microscopic flow structure quantitatively, for the first time, a new calibration method is developed to correlate the solids holdup of the FCC particles and the grayscales of the images obtained by the high-speed video camera, based on the light illumination consistency verified by a reference plate. To achieve stable and <b>homogeneous</b> <b>fluidization</b> with uniform solids holdup, the calibration experiment is conducted in a well-designed liquid-solid bed. The obtained calibration curve and equation are used {{as the basis for the}} entire study. With the calibration method, cluster can be “peeled-off” by given solids holdup thresholds through transforming the original gray images into binary images. The change in cluster population with operating conditions consistent with previous researchers further proves that the image calibration method developed in this study is effective and very useful. To further verify the newly developed image calibration method, an optical fiber probe is applied as a reference for the measurements of the solids holdup of the FCC particles. The solids holdup distribution profiles obtained from the two methods under identical operating conditions have good agreement, reflecting the reliability of the image calibration method. Further comparison of the results of image calibration method from the current study with the measurement results of optical fiber probe from other researchers also show good agreement under the same operating condition. These comparisons clearly confirm the feasibility and accuracy of the image calibration method. Using the image calibration method, the mean solids holdup under different operating conditions can be calculated from the mean grayscale of the images. The results show that the mean solids holdup increases with the increasing Gs and decreases with Ug. The transformation from grayscale images into Hue, Saturation and Value (HSV) images using various solids holdup thresholds allows the dense and dilute phases with obviously different solids holdup to be clearly visualized under different operating conditions in the fully developed region. A term “relative dense phase area” is introduced to quantify the solids phase separation. A critical solids holdup value of εsc = 0. 04 is chosen by carefully examining the variation profiles of the relative dense phase area with solids holdup thresholds, to demarcate the dilute and dense cluster phases. The cluster fraction is then obtained through the εsc value and ranges from 1 % to 59 % under the different operating conditions of present research. With images divided into three regions along the lateral direction, it is found that cluster fraction at the wall region is higher than that of the core and the middle regions. With further examining the solids holdup distribution of the microscopic structures, the dense (or cluster) phase is considered as a “compound” of core clusters and intermediate dispersed particles, which is in the processing of coalescence or breakup, with higher solids holdup than the dilute phase. To identify stable existing core clusters, a systematic cluster identification process is presented by adopting a threshold selection method to obtain the cluster threshold solids holdup (εsct) so that clusters can be identified under different operating conditions. The cluster fraction is calculated by dividing the total number of pixels belonging to the core cluster with the total pixels number of the entire image. Based on the εsct, a cluster equivalent diameter (dc) is determined by the area of the cluster in the binary image. At the same time, the cluster solids holdup can be determined by converting the grayscale of the cluster from the original image to the solids holdup. Moreover, cluster vertical velocity can be determined by the shift of clusters between sequential binary images. Typical dense (Ug = 3. 0 m/s; Gs = 100 kg/m 2 s) and dilute (Ug = 9. 0 m/s; Gs = 50 kg/m 2 s) operating conditions are selected to compare the variation of the cluster size and velocity...|$|E
