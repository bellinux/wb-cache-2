Two of the seven naturally occurring isotopes of gadolinium have very large absorption cross sections for thermal neutrons. The isotopes of ¹⁵⁵ Gd and ¹⁵⁷ Gd readily absorb thermal neutrons and transmute to ¹⁵⁶ Gd and ¹⁵⁸ Gd which are poor thermal neutron absorbers. Because of this property, gadolinium is termed a burnable neutron poison. At sufficient concentrations, <b>gadolinia</b> becomes a self-shielded absorber in that the neutron absorption event occurs very near the absorbing surface and the internal volume of the absorber sees little or no thermal neutron flux. The study of self-shielded burnable absorbers is not new to the Nuclear industry.

The material used for the hot gas path components can only withstand temperature up to a certain limit. Thermal barrier coatings (TBC) provide the additional thermal protection for these components and help the gas turbine achieve higher firing temperatures. Traditionally available yttria stabilized zirconia (YSZ) TBCs have a limitation up to 1200 C due to their phase transformation. The present work focuses on <b>gadolinia</b> based hafnia (GSH) TBCs to study their potential to replace the YSZ coatings. Different compositions of <b>gadolinia</b> doped hafnia coatings have been deposited using electron beam physical vapor deposition (EB-PVD) technique and characterized using x-ray diffraction (XRD) and scanning electron microscope (SEM). The crystal structure analysis performed using XRD confirmed the stabilization of the high temperature cubic phase of hafnia. Cross sectional analysis confirmed the presence of columnar structure in the coatings which is a signature of the EB-PVD coatings. Mechanical properties of the coatings were investigated using nanoindentation and nano impact testing at both room temperature and high temperature. Indentation tests indicate a reduction in hardness with an increase in temperature and <b>gadolinia</b> content in hafnia. Impact testing reveals the fracture resistance of the coatings as a function of stabilizer content and heat treatment. Thermal measurements and impedance testing was performed on the bulk material to study the effect of <b>gadolinia</b> content.

Models of the defect chemistry and oxygen permeation phenomena are used to interpret the measurements. The models are further used to predict the performance of oxygen separation membranes and fuel cells with mixed conducting materials. Electrolyte probe measurements revealed that the surface reaction rate constants of oxygen leaving a membrane (reduction) and oxygen entering the membrane (oxidation) of the investigated MIECs are the same. Both the oxide site reduced diffusion coefficient, analogous to the mobility of a single ion vacancy, and the oxide site vacancy concentration were dependent on the chemical potential of oxygen and the temperature.

It has been observed that the conductivity of microwave sintered GDC–Al 2 O 3 composite is {{higher than that of}} conventional sintered GDC–Al 2 O 3 composite and pure GDC sample. Higher concentration of vacancies at the interfaces of GDC and Al 2 O 3 phases may be responsible for the better conductivity of GDC–Al 2 O 3 composite compared to pure GDC. The fine grain microstructure of microwave sintered samples creates more interfaces compared to conventional sintered sample which in turn responsible for the better performance of microwave sintered composite sample. The micro-structural results of microwave sintered samples also reveal the presence of elongated, needle like Al 2 O 3 grains. The X-ray diffraction results have shown the formation of additional GdAlO 3 phase...|$|E
