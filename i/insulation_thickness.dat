In this research, {{a series}} of [Fe 80 Ni 20 -O/NiZn-ferrite]n {{multilayer}} thin films with different <b>insulation</b> layer <b>thickness</b> were prepared by magnetron sputtering at room temperature. The high frequency soft magnetic properties of [Fe 80 Ni 20 -O/NiZn-ferrite]n multilayer thin films were investigated. It {{was found that the}} in-plane magnetic anisotropy field (Hk) and saturation magnetizations (4 πMs) can be adjusted by changing the <b>insulation</b> layer <b>thickness,</b> and the optimal Hk and 4 πMs can be obtained as the <b>insulation</b> layer <b>thickness</b> of 2. 5 nm. The adjustment of <b>insulation</b> layer <b>thickness</b> is essential to obtain low coercivity (Hc) and high permeability (μ') of the multilayer thin films.

50|$|For pipe insulation, the R-value varies {{not only}} with the <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness</b> and thermal {{conductivity}} ("k-value") but also with the pipe outer diameter and the average material temperature. For this reason, it is more common to use the thermal conductivity value when comparing the effectiveness of pipe insulation, and R-values of pipe insulation are not covered by the US FTC R-value rule.|$|E
50|$|<b>Insulation</b> <b>thickness</b> or type {{also has}} no audible effect {{as long as}} the {{insulation}} is of good quality and does not chemically react with the wire itself (poor-quality insulation has occasionally been found to accelerate oxidation of the copper conductor, increasing resistance over time). High-power in-car audio systems using 2-ohm speaker circuits require thicker wire than 4 to 8-ohm home audio applications.|$|E
50|$|Magnetic {{recording}} heads utilize electric {{fields to}} polarize particles {{and leave a}} magnetized pattern on a hard disk. AlO ALD is used to create uniform, thin layers of insulation. By using ALD, {{it is possible to}} control the <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness</b> to a high level of accuracy. This allows for more accurate patterns of magnetized particles and thus higher quality recordings.|$|E
50|$|Pipe {{insulation}} {{made from}} rigid Phenolic, PIR, or PUR foam insulation {{is common in}} some countries. Rigid-foam insulation has minimal acoustic performance but can exhibit low thermal-conductivity values of 0.021 W/(m·K) or lower, allowing energy-saving legislation to be met whilst using reduced <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses.</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{calculation}} procedure for the economic, energetic and environmental optimum <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses</b> is very similar: For the energetic and environmental assessments, the initial investment, {{used for the}} economic LCCA, is substituted by the embodied energy and the global warming potential of the greenhouse gases associated with the manufacture of the insulation material, respectively.|$|R
30|$|In this context, {{the present}} study has been {{developed}} with the following objectives: (1) quantify how the optimum thickness values, based on economic, energetic and environmental points of views, vary {{as a function of}} the insulation materials and (2) identify the relevant parameters, focusing on the ones related to the fabrication process of the insulation materials that determines the optimum <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses.</b>|$|R
50|$|Both {{mineral wool}} and {{fibreglass}} {{are used in}} autoclaves. The thickness varies with internal temperature, ranging from a bare minimum of two to three inches up to {{three to four times}} that, the rough rule of thumb being one inch per hundred degrees F. Economically, the biggest effect is to raise the pressure vessel cost by increasing its diameter. This effectively discourages over-specifying the <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness.</b>|$|E
5000|$|The {{insulating}} material usually used is polyurethane foam or similar, with a {{coefficient of thermal conductivity}} k=0.033-0.024 W/mK (thermal conductivity). Outer casing is usually high-density polyethylene (HDPE). Production of preinsulated pipes for district heating in the European Union is {{regulated by the}} standard EN253. According to EN253:2003, pipes must be produced to work at constant temperature of [...] for 30 years, keeping thermal conductivity {{less than or equal to}} 0.033 W/mK. There are three <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness</b> levels.|$|E
5000|$|The {{location}} of pipework also influences {{the selection of}} <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness.</b> For instance, in some circumstances, heating pipework within a well-insulated building might not require insulation, as the heat that's [...] "lost" [...] (i.e., the heat that flows from the pipe to the surrounding air) may be considered “useful” for heating the building, as such [...] "lost" [...] heat would be effectively trapped by the structural insulation anyway. [...] Conversely, such pipework may be insulated to prevent overheating or unnecessary cooling in the rooms through which it passes.|$|E
40|$|This is a heat-transfer {{study of}} the soil (below a cold store) {{containing}} immersed heating elements to prevent freezing. The numerical study utilizes the unconditionally stable, finite-difference technique. Different heat-generation profiles were considered, viz., uniform, step variation, linear variation, and non-linear variation.

40|$|The {{degree of}} nonuniformity of the billet {{temperature}} {{subjected to the}} radiative heat loss to the discharge door with different <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses</b> is investigated in this present study. The 2 -D steady-state heat conduction for the billet subjected to different heat fluxes is solved by being transformed into a dimensionless form. The Gauss-Seidel iterative method for a finite volume discretization of the billet is employed to obtain the temperature distribution of the billet. The numerical result is validated by comparing with the field measurement data. A qualitative agreement between these two is observed. An effect of different <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses</b> on the heat-transfer characteristics {{and the degree of}} nonuniformity of the billet temperature is examined. In case of the replaced 50 -mm thick insulation of the discharge door, the radiative heat loss to the discharge door is reduced by 49 % with the replaced insulation, and the degree of nonuniformity of the billet temperature is decreased by 23 °C...|$|R
30|$|We {{can observe}} that {{the order of}} the optimum {{thickness}} varies depending on the optimization point of view. For each one, the general trend is similar for the four insulation materials studied. Nevertheless, the dispersion of the results in the different calculation settings, for a given optimization point of view, is higher when the <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses</b> are higher. This demonstrates that, in such cases, the impact of the calculation settings, and therefore of the use phase of the building, is higher.|$|R
50|$|This {{structure}} {{and thus a}} capacitor of this type is present in every MIS field-effect transistor, such as MOSFETs. For the steady reduction {{of the size of}} structures in microelectronics, the following facts are clear. From the formula above it follows that capacitance increases with ever thinner layers of insulation. For all MIS devices the <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness</b> cannot fall below a minimum of around 10 nm. Using thinner insultation than this leads to the occurrence of tunneling through the insulating material (dielectric). Due to this, the use of so-called high-k materials as the insulator material is being investigated (as of 2009).|$|E
5000|$|Spark plug wires have {{an outer}} {{insulation}} several times thicker than the conductor, {{made of a}} very flexible and heat-resistant material such as silicone or EPDM rubber. The thick insulation prevents arcing from the cable to an earthed engine component. A rubber [...] "boot" [...] covers each terminal. Dielectric grease {{can be used to}} improve insulation; a small amount can be applied in the inside of the rubber boot at each end of each wire to help seal out moisture. Printing on spark plug wires may include a brand name, <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness</b> (in millimeters), insulation material type, cylinder number, and conductor type (suppressor or solid wire).|$|E
5000|$|Imbalance: {{differences}} between the two wires in a pair can cause coupling between the common mode and the differential mode. Differential to common mode conversion produces common mode currents that can cause external interference and can produce common mode signals in other pairs. Common mode to differential mode conversion can produce differential mode signals from common mode interference from other pairs or external sources. Imbalance can be caused by asymmetry between the two conductors of the pair from each other and in relationship to other wires and the shield.

40|$|An {{experimental}} study concerned with different modes of heal transfer in fibrous and cellulose insulating material is presented. A {{series of experiments}} were conducted using an attic simulator {{to determine the effects}} of ventilation on attic heat transfer, and the effect of infrared radiation on the thermal conductivity of the insulation system and on attic heat transfer. All the tests were performed at steady state conditions by controlling the roof deck temperature. Calculations are performed for <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses</b> between 1 inch (2. 54 cm) and 6. 0 inches (15. 24 cm) and roof deck temperatures between 145 ?F (62. 78 ?C) and 100 ?F (36. 78 ?C). The temperature profiles within the insulation were measured by placing thermocouples at various levels within the insulation. The profiles for the cellulose insulation are linear. The profiles within the glass fiber insulation are non-linear due to the effect of infrared radiation. Also heat fluxes were measured through different <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses</b> and for different roof temperatures. It was found that a radiant barrier such as aluminum foil can reduce the heat flux significantly. Experimental results were compared to a Three-Region approximate solution developed at Oak Ridge National Laboratories (ORNL). The model was in good agreement with experimental results...|$|R
40|$|A simple {{transient}} {{analysis of}} a built-in storage solar water heater is presented; the results obtained by the present theory are {{in close agreement with}} experimental observations as well as with predictions obtained by a more rigorous theory. The water heater consits of an insulated rectangular tank whose top surface is suitably blackened by blackboard paint and then glazed. The unit is exposed to solar radiation during sunshine hours and is covered by adequate insulation at night. The effect of <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses</b> (top and bottom insulation) and water mass in the tank is discussed. The importance of using a reflecting sheet instead of insulation is emphasised. ...|$|R
50|$|Alternative {{isolators}} {{are typically}} built using ultra thin (0.01 mm - 0.02 mm) insulation layers, whereas optocouplers have <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses</b> up to 2 mm. The thinner insulation barrier means that alternative isolators experience much higher electric-field stress than optocouplers, {{and could be}} less robust under high voltages. Currently, there are no IEC component level safety standard available for such isolators. As a result, some manufacturers might seek IEC 60747-5-2 (older revision) or IEC 60747-5-5 (current revision) certification (a standard originally intended for optocouplers). Alternative isolators are structurally different from optocouplers and thus do not qualify for full IEC60747-5-2/5 certification, but only for BASIC insulation.|$|R
50|$|Industry {{standards}} are often rules of thumb, developed over many years, that offset many conflicting goals: what people will pay for, manufacturing cost, local climate, traditional building practices, and varying standards of comfort. Both heat transfer and layer analysis may {{be performed in}} large industrial applications, but in household situations (appliances and building insulation), air tightness is the key in reducing heat transfer due to air leakage (forced or natural convection). Once air tightness is achieved, {{it has often been}} sufficient to choose the thickness of the insulating layer based on rules of thumb. Diminishing returns are achieved with each successive doubling of the insulating layer.It can be shown that for some systems, there is a minimum <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness</b> required for an improvement to be realized.|$|E
5000|$|Several {{inches of}} {{insulation}} must {{be added to}} the inside working diameter to get the diameter of the pressure vessel. Putting the insulation on the outside yields the smallest pressure vessel for a given inside working diameter, but the energy required to heat up the vessel itself each cycle soon makes this a very unattractive way of economizing, unless steam injection is used for heating, in which event external insulation must be used. For most machines, figure on four to six inches of <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness.</b> On machines rated at less than , this can be reduced to three inches (76 mm) [...] For temperatures over , it should be increased to eight inches or more. This affects the diameter significantly, but the trade-off generally favours the additional insulation.|$|E
50|$|It {{was later}} on in the year in September 1882 that Edison opened the Pearl Street Power Station in New York City and again it was a DC supply. It was for this reason that the {{generation}} was close to or on the consumer's premises as Edison had no means of voltage conversion. The voltage chosen for any electrical system is a compromise. For a given amount of power transmitted, increasing the voltage reduces the current and therefore reduces the required wire thickness. Unfortunately it also increases the danger from direct contact and increases the required <b>insulation</b> <b>thickness.</b> Furthermore, some load types were difficult or impossible to make work with higher voltages. The overall effect was that Edison's system required power stations to be within a mile of the consumers. While this could work in city centres, it would be unable to economically supply suburbs with power.|$|E
40|$|Attempts {{to reduce}} {{national}} energy demands {{have led to}} increases in <b>insulation</b> <b>thicknesses</b> in roof spaces in northern Europe and North America. Generally it has been assumed that the apparent thermal conductivity of each material used {{has been a constant}} and equal to the value obtained in a testing laboratory under different conditions. Examination of the vertical temperature profiles through various horizontal thicknesses of loose-fill mineral wool insulants suggests that convection in the upper surface layers exposed to the free air and radiation contributions result in much larger apparent thermal conductivities than those quoted in the literature and the magnitudes of these effects increase with the thickness of the insulant layer. ...|$|R
