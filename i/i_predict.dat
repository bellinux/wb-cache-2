500|$|Jenny was {{negatively}} received amongst TV critics and viewers {{from the very}} first episode after she cheated on her nice guy boyfriend, Tim, with another woman for no clear reason. This prompted Chaiken to implement a series of changes to Jenny to help make her more likable. Chaiken defended Jenny stating: [...] "I'm well aware of the response to Jenny. I love the character, and I love that people are passionate about her. I know {{there are a lot of}} people who just can't stand her. And that's why it's so important to have that character in the mix." [...] Kirshner defended Jenny stating: [...] "Jenny's a very controversial character. I think the great thing about her is the fact that she's so flawed." [...] During season two Jenny is seen coming out, getting her hair cut and becoming best friends with Shane McCutcheon (Katherine Moennig). AfterEllen.com stated that Jenny cutting off her hair was a defining moment in her development because it also symbolized her cutting all of the bad stuff that happened before out of her life. Jenny's transition continued into season three, Chaiken stated: [...] "We find Jenny coming together, <b>I</b> <b>predict</b> this [...] that Jenny will be more likable and accessible to the audience than she has ever been.

40|$|Career {{decision-making}} {{self-efficacy and}} the Big Five traits of neuroticism, extraversion, and conscientiousness were examined {{as predictors of}} career indecision {{in a sample of}} 181 undergraduates. Participants completed an online survey. <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that the Big Five traits and career decision-making self-efficacy would (a) interrelate moderately and (b) each relate significantly and moderately to career indecision. In addition, <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that career decision-making self-efficacy would partially mediate the relationships between the Big Five traits and career indecision, while the Big Five traits were predicted to moderate the relationship between career decision-making self-efficacy and career indecision. Finally, <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that career decision-making self-efficacy would account for a greater amount of unique variance in career indecision than the Big Five traits. All predicted correlations were significant. Career decision-making self-efficacy fully mediated the relationship of Extraversion to career indecision and partially mediated the relationships of Neuroticism and Conscientiousness to career indecision. Conscientiousness was found to moderate the relationship of career decision-making self-efficacy to career indecision such that the negative relation between self-efficacy and career indecision was stronger in the presence of high conscientiousness. This study builds upon existing research on the prediction of career indecision by examining potential mediating and moderating relationships...|$|R
40|$|Research {{has shown}} that {{spending}} money on other people (i. e., pro-social spending) is associated with greater happiness than spending money on oneself (Dunn, Aknin, & Norton, 2008). To date, however, little research has investigated who {{is most likely to}} derive benefits from pro-social spending, and why. Drawing from values theory, <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that the relationship between pro-social spending and well-being would be greater for givers who endorse human values associated with self-transcendence than {{for those who do not}} endorse these values. Conversely, <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that endorsement of self-enhancement values would undermine the well-being benefits associated with pro-social spending. Based on Self-Determination Theory, <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that psychological need satisfaction would mediate the relation between pro-social spending and well-being, but only for those high in self-transcendence and/or low in self-enhancement values. Results indicated that high endorsement of self-transcendence values is associated with increased well-being from pro-social spending, while low endorsement of self-transcendence values is not. Endorsement of self-enhancement values did not influence this relationship. Additionally, the pro-social spending - well-being relationship was mediated by psychological need satisfaction for all value orientations except low self-transcendence. Discussion focuses on implications for values theory and positive psychology interventions...|$|R
2500|$|... "The try Australia scored {{towards the}} end of the first half was relayed {{endlessly}} on television and, <b>I</b> <b>predict,</b> will be shown again and again in years to come. It was Lynagh, running towards the blind side, who set things in motion. Noticing that the New Zealand backs were lined up flat, he chipped the ball into the gap behind the winger. The New Zealand fullback, Kieran Crowley, was regarded by the Australians as being a little slow off the mark, and no doubt Lynagh had this in mind when he chose to kick in front of him. Campese was bearing down on the ball, and I think Crowley was undecided whether to go in for the ball or wait for the bounce and try to stop Campese. His slight hesitation gave Campese the fraction of a second he needed to scoop up the ball and flash past him. Campese's running then was superb. He drew two defenders and had a third one chasing him, all of whom thought he was a threat. Campese saw Tim Horan behind him out of the corner of his eye and flipped the ball back over his shoulder. Horan did well to catch it before going on to score." ...|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. A.) [...] Wichita State University, Fairmount College of Liberal Arts and Sciences, Dept. of Sociology. My thesis {{focuses on}} the impact student {{engagement}} has on tenth grade mathematic test scores. Using secondary data from the Education Longitudinal Survey, I examined the math scores of 7, 480 tenth graders in 2004. <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that students who were more engaged in their school environment will have higher test scores. In addition to engagement, I examine the impact that social networks and parental influences play in these math scores. <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that school engagement, school factors, parental influences, and peer relationships would {{play a role in}} determining tenth grade math scores. In addition, <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that socioeconomic status (SES) would play a role in determining extracurricular activities and parental involvement. Overall, many of the hypotheses tested were supported, indicating that increasing student engagement with their school will {{have a positive impact on}} their math scores. Parental involvement had a more positive impact on math scores among higher SES families, particularly because the social expectations and network surrounding the students. SES had a significant impact on math scores by impacting the school, the expectations, and the parental influence on the child. Peer influences researched here had a negligible impact on math scores. Future research from here needs to focus on the implementation of student engagement activities and the effectiveness of these activities...|$|R
40|$|Drawing {{on prior}} {{research}} from several areas of psychology, <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that {{different forms of}} organizational justice would predict counterproductive work behaviour (CWB) depending on employees’ age. In particular, <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that distributive justice {{would be associated with}} CWB more so for younger than older employees, whereas interactional justice would be associated with CWB more so for older than younger employees. In an initial study, 192 employees completed an online survey which assessed the focal variables. Hierarchical regression analysis revealed the two predicted 2 -way interactions. The findings are in line with aging research suggesting that, whereas younger people are more motivated by instrumental concerns, relational concerns become more salient as they age. The results have important implications for research on justice and CWB, and they extend basic research on human aging to an applied context. 1 yea...|$|R

Issued also on microfiche from Lange Micrographics. The construct of covert antisocial behavior (CAB) was investigated. Expert judges rated a subset of behaviors from the Child Behavior Checklist-parent Form and Teacher Report Form of the Child Behavior Checklist (Achenbach, 1991) in terms of their frequency of covertness and antisociality. Those behaviors that were judged to be frequently antisocial and covert were used as a measure of covert antisocial behavior in this study. Three relations were predicted: (1) <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> a positive correlation between CAB and relational aggression (RA). (2) <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that children who exhibit both relational aggression and overt aggression evince greater levels of CAB than children who use only relational aggression or only overt aggression. (3) <b>I</b> <b>predicted</b> that CAB will predict children's social preference scores above and beyond parent and teacher ratings of overt aggressive behavior. Results demonstrated no correlation between RA and teacher- and parent-rated covert antisocial behavior. Additionally, there was no main effect of type of aggression, and thus no moderating effect of gender on children's parent- and teacher-rated covert antisocial behavior. However, parent-rated CAB significantly predicted children's social preference scores...|$|R
