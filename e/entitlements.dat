40|$|Previous {{personality}} research (e. g., Campbell et al., 2004) {{has described}} the sense of <b>entitlement</b> as an unifactorial construct. In this study, we examined characteristics of two potential facets of entitlement: exploitive <b>entitlement,</b> characterized by exploitive interactions and expectations of special treatment, and non-exploitive <b>entitlement,</b> or entitled beliefs that rest on notions of self-worth and fairness. 466 college students (mean age = 20. 5) completed a questionnaire consisting of unifactorial and two-factor measures of <b>entitlement</b> and other personality dispositions and attitudes. As expected, both exploitive and non-exploitive <b>entitlement</b> were positively related to the Psychological <b>Entitlement</b> Scale (PES; r =. 51 and r =. 43, respectively), an unifactorial measure of <b>entitlement.</b> In other respects, exploitive and non-exploitive <b>entitlement</b> had quite distinct correlates. Exploitive <b>entitlement</b> was uniquely related {{to higher levels of}} psychopathy and neuroticism, and lower levels of work orientation, social commitment, and self-esteem; whereas non-exploitive <b>entitlement</b> was uniquely associated with higher self-esteem. © 2010 The Foundation for Professionals in Services for Adolescents...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{investigate}} the relationship between psychological <b>entitlement</b> (active, passive, and revenge), narcissism and two types of organizational behaviors in employees. Interactions between narcissism and psychological <b>entitlement</b> as predictors of organizational citizenship behaviors (OCB) and counterproductive work behaviors (CWB) were explored. Predictors were analyzed in an effort to determine whether psychological <b>entitlement</b> plays a more destructive role among narcissistic employees than among non-narcissistic ones and whether the effects of narcissism on OCB and CWB are mediated by <b>entitlement.</b> Participants and procedure Data were obtained from 100 employees (34 % men) aged 22 to 59 years (M = 37. 00, SD = 9. 30) from public and private companies. Participants were asked to complete the Organizational Citizenship Behavior Scale (OCBS), the Counterproductive Organizational Behaviors Scale (COBS), the <b>Entitlement</b> Questionnaire, and the Narcissistic Personality Inventory (NPI). Results Positive aspects of <b>entitlement</b> were positively associated with OCB only among narcissistic employees, and active <b>entitlement</b> mediated the effects of narcissism on CWB. Active <b>entitlement</b> was negatively related to CWB. Negative aspects of <b>entitlement</b> were negatively related to OCB and unrelated to CWB. Conclusions This study provides evidence for positive (healthy) aspects of <b>entitlement</b> for organizations. The unexpected interaction between narcissism and <b>entitlement</b> in predicting higher levels of OCB suggests that among narcissistic employees, healthy aspects of <b>entitlement</b> are desirable and profitable for an organization. Psychological <b>entitlement</b> was observed to be an important predictor of organizational behaviors beyond narcissism itself...|$|R

In this dissertation, the impact of <b>entitlement</b> on romantic relationship satisfaction was investigated. On the other hand, psychological literature suggests humility may benefit interpersonal relationships. The impact of humility on relationship satisfaction was also examined in this dissertation. A sample of 158 individuals in monogamous romantic relationships of at least one year completed self-report measures of trait <b>entitlement,</b> relational <b>entitlement,</b> humility, relationship satisfaction, positive affect maintenance skills, and negative affect reduction skills. As expected, trait <b>entitlement</b> and relational <b>entitlement</b> were both significant negative predictors of relationship satisfaction. Also as expected, humility was a significant positive predictor of relational satisfaction. Additionally, results showed trait <b>entitlement</b> significantly moderated the relationship between negative affect reduction and relational satisfaction, such that participants with low levels of trait <b>entitlement</b> showed a stronger relationship between negative affect reduction and relationship satisfaction than participants who scored high on <b>entitlement...</b>|$|R

40|$|The {{current study}} {{explored}} {{the relation between}} the Big-Five personality domains, self-regulated learning, and academic <b>entitlement.</b> Academic <b>entitlement</b> is defined as the tendency to possess expectations of unearned academic success, unearned/undeserved academic services, and/or the expectation of unrealistic accommodation (Chowning 2 ̆ 6 Campbell, 2009; Singleton-Jackson, Jackson, 2 ̆ 6 Reinhardt, 2010). Academic <b>entitlement</b> is a pervasive problem in today 2 ̆ 7 s university environment, making it important to understand risk factors for academic <b>entitlement.</b> Previous research on academic <b>entitlement</b> has reported a relation between personality factors and academic <b>entitlement</b> (Chowning 2 ̆ 6 Campbell, 2009), and between academic <b>entitlement</b> and self-regulated learning (Achacoso, 2002). These relations were explored in the current study. A relation between personality and academic <b>entitlement</b> that is mediated by self-regulated learning was also explored. Regression analysis suggested that self-regulated learning was negatively related to academic <b>entitlement</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 10). In terms of personality, agreeableness was negatively related to academic <b>entitlement</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) and extraversion was positively related to academic <b>entitlement</b> (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). Agreeableness (p 3 ̆c 0. 10), conscientiousness (p 3 ̆c 0. 05), and openness (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) were positively related to self-regulated learning. Neuroticism (p 3 ̆c 0. 05) was also positively related to academic <b>entitlement,</b> this finding was unexpected.

40|$|Background The {{current study}} {{investigated}} the role of three facets of <b>entitlement</b> (active, passive and revenge) in various forms of subjective well-being (SWB) : hedonistic and two facets of eudaimonic well-being (social and psychological). Social well-being was based on Keyes’ model (1998) and psychological well-being on Ryff’s model (1989). Participants and procedure The study was performed in three nations (Poland, Puerto Rico and Vietnam) on student samples (Poland, n = 245, Vietnam, n = 115, and Puerto Rico, n = 300). To assess <b>entitlement</b> level the <b>Entitlement</b> Questionnaire was used. The level of hedonistic well-being was measured with the Satisfaction with Life Scale (SWLS) and the Positive and Negative Affect Schedule (PANAS), and eudaimonic well-being by the Mental Health Continuum–Short Form (MHC-SF). Results Active <b>entitlement</b> {{was positively related to}} all aspects of SWB. Revenge <b>entitlement</b> was negatively related to hedonistic and psychological SWB in all samples and negatively related to social well-being only in Poland. Passive <b>entitlement</b> was unrelated to SWB. Conclusions The current study shows cross-cultural similarities in relationships of <b>entitlement</b> with hedonistic and psychological well-being and cross-cultural differences in the relationship of <b>entitlement</b> with social well-being. Additionally, the study indicates positive meaning of healthy aspects of <b>entitlement</b> for subjective well-being and negative meaning of dysfunctional aspects of <b>entitlement</b> for subjective well-being...|$|R

Before leaving the military service men and women attended either a dispersal centre or naval depot where they were provided with a medical examination, interviewed by a rehabilitation officer and provided with information about the benefits they were eligible for. The Manpower Directorate was then responsible for placing discharged personnel in employment as well as providing them with identity documentation and ration <b>entitlements.</b> Training courses were made available to veterans, and by 1951 94,000 had completed university, technical or rural training courses and 39,000 were still in training.

On paper, many heads of state and, most importantly, the rulers of the German states of the Holy Roman Empire, accepted the Pragmatic Sanction and the idea of Francis as the next emperor. Two key exceptions, the duchies of Bavaria and Saxony, held important electoral votes and could impede or even block Francis's election.

5|$|Planning for the {{demobilisation}} of the Australian military {{began at}} the end of 1942 when the Department of Post-War Reconstruction was formed. The department was involved with drawing up plans for determining veterans' <b>entitlements</b> and the assistance which would be provided to discharged personnel to help them settle into civilian life. This included planning the delivery of training, housing and ensuring that jobs were available. An important consideration was to ensure that civilian employment opportunities were created at an appropriate rate as the size of the military was reduced. In order to achieve this, it was decided to continue many wartime economic regulations such as price controls in order to limit inflation and direct resources to where the Australian Government believed they were most needed.|$|E

In 1971, after the war, Prime Minister Indira Gandhi decided to promote Manekshaw to field marshal and subsequently to appoint him as the Chief of the Defence Staff (CDS). This appointment was dropped after several objections from the bureaucracy and the commanders of the navy and the air force. On 3 January 1973, after his term as the Chief of the Army Staff (COAS) Manekshaw was conferred with the rank of field marshal at a ceremony held at Rashtrapati Bhavan.

5|$|Electricity for Canberra mainly {{comes from}} the {{national}} power grid through substations at Holt and Fyshwick (via Queanbeyan). Power was first supplied from a thermal plant built in 1913, near the Molonglo River, but this was finally closed in 1957. A 20 megawatt photovoltaic solar plant, described as the largest photovoltaic solar farm in Australia, was officially opened at Royalla on 3 September 2014. The 2.3 megawatt Mount Majura solar farm was opened in Majura on 6 October 2016. Construction is under way on a 13 megawatt solar farm at Mugga Lane, Hume and an 11 megawatt solar farm at Williamsdale. The Williamsdale solar farm was originally planned to be built at Uriarra but faced local opposition. In addition numerous houses in Canberra have photovoltaic panels and/or solar hot water systems. Some limited local renewable power is produced via a hydro generator on the main water supply pipeline for Canberra at Mount Stromlo and methane plants at waste landfill sites at Belconnen and Mugga Lane. There are currently no wind-power generators in Canberra, but several have been built or are being built or planned in nearby New South Wales, such as the 140.7 megawatt Capital Wind Farm. The ACT government announced in 2013 that it was raising the target for electricity consumed in the ACT to be supplied from renewable sources to 90% by 2020. This will raise the target from 210 to 550 megawatts. It announced in February 2015 that three wind farms in Victoria and South Australia would supply 200 megawatts of capacity; these {{are expected to be}} operational by 2017. Contracts for the purchase of an additional 200 megawatts of power per year from two wind farms in South Australia and New South Wales were announced in December 2015 and March 2016.
