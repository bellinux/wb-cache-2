5|$|Europeans first {{witnessed}} the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> {{in the early}} 1600s. Perhaps the first recorded instance of a European actually entering China via the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> came in 1605, when the Portuguese Jesuit brother Bento de Góis reached the northwestern Jiayu Pass from India. Ivan Petlin's 1619 deposition for his Russian embassy mission offers an early account based on a first-hand encounter with the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall,</b> and mentions that {{in the course of}} the journey his embassy travelled alongside the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> for ten days.|$|E

The Badaling <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> has since become a staple stop for foreign dignitaries who come to China, beginning with Nepali prime minister Bishweshwar Prasad Koirala in 1960, and most notably the American president Richard Nixon in his historic 1972 visit to China. To date, Badaling is still the most visited stretch of the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|E

5|$|The travelogues of {{the later}} 19th century in turn further contributed to the {{elaboration}} and propagation of the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> myth.

5|$|The {{usefulness}} of the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> as a defence line against northern nomads became questionable under the Qing dynasty, since their territory encompassed vast areas {{inside and outside the}} wall: China proper, Manchuria, and Mongolia were all under Qing control. So instead, the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> became the means to limit Han Chinese movement into the steppes. In the case of Manchuria, considered to be the sacred homeland by the ruling Manchu elites, some parts of the Ming Liaodong Wall were repaired so it could serve to control Han Chinese movement into Manchuria alongside the newly erected Willow Palisade.|$|E
5|$|Wall {{construction}} {{continued until}} {{the demise of}} the Ming dynasty in 1644. In the decades that led to the fall of the Ming dynasty, the Ming court and the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> itself had to deal with simultaneous internal rebellions and the Manchu invasions. In addition to their conquest of Liaodong, the Manchus had raided across the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> {{for the first time in}} 1629, and again in 1634, 1638, and 1642. Meanwhile, the rebels led by warlord Li Zicheng had been gathering strength. In the early months of 1644, Li Zicheng declared himself the founder of the Shun and marched towards the Ming capital from Shaanxi. His route roughly followed the line of the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall,</b> in order to neutralize its heavily fortified garrisons. The crucial defences of Datong, Xuanfu, and Juyong Pass all surrendered without a fight, and the Chongzhen Emperor hanged himself on 25 April as the Shun army entered Beijing. At this point, the largest remaining Ming fighting force in North China was in Shanhai Pass, where the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> meets the Bohai Sea. Its defender Wu Sangui, wedged between the Shun army within and the Manchus without, decided to surrender to the Manchus and opened the gates for them. The Manchus, having thus entered through the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall,</b> defeated Li Zicheng at the Battle of Shanhai Pass and seized Beijing on June5. They eventually defeated both the rebel-founded Shun dynasty and the remaining Ming resistance, establishing their rule over all of China as the Qing dynasty.|$|E

5|$|Although {{a useful}} {{deterrent}} against raids, at several points throughout its history the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> failed to stop enemies, including in 1644 when the Manchu Qing marched {{through the gates}} of Shanhai Pass and replaced the most ardent of the wall-building dynasties, the Ming, as rulers of China.|$|E

Under their ambitious and energetic management, 1200 brick watchtowers were built along the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> from 1569 to 1571. These included the first large-scale use of hollow watchtowers on the Wall: up until this point, most previous towers along the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> had been solid, with a small hut on top for a sentry to take shelter from the elements and Mongol arrows; the Ji–Chang towers built from 1569 onwards were hollow brick structures, allowing soldiers interior space to live, store food and water, stockpile weapons, and take shelter from Mongol arrows.|$|E

Echocardiographic abnormalities were then correlated with clinical variables and survival at follow-up. Patients were subgrouped by left ventricular wall thickness: Group I, mean wall thickness 12 mm or less; Group II, mean <b>wall</b> thickness <b>greater</b> than 12 mm but less than 15 mm; Group III, mean wall thickness 15 mm or greater; or Group IV, atypical features such as wall motion abnormalities or left ventricular dilation. Patients with <b>greater</b> <b>wall</b> thickness had a higher frequency of associated echocardiographic abnormalities such as left atrial enlarge ment or granular sparkling appearance on two-dimensional examination and, more commonly, reduced systolic function. The occurrence of clinical congestive heart failure was strongly correlated with <b>greater</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and multiple other echocardiographic abnormalities. Survival was negatively influenced both by <b>greater</b> <b>wall</b> thickness and reduced systolic function. The median survival of the entire group was 1. 1 years. Echocardiographic examination is an important tool for establishing the presence of cardiac amyloid involvement and {{may be useful in}} estimating prognosis in such patients...|$|R

5|$|Since then, many {{scholars}} have operated under {{the belief that}} the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> continually defended China's border against the steppe nomads for two thousand years. For example, the 18th-century sinologist Joseph de Guignes assigned macrohistorical importance to such walls when he advanced the theory that the Qin construction forced the Xiongnu to migrate west to Europe and, becoming known as the Huns, ultimately contributed to the decline of the Roman Empire. Some have attempted to make general statements regarding Chinese society and foreign policy based on the conception of a perennial Great Wall: Karl Marx took the Wall to represent the stagnation of the Chinese society and economy, Owen Lattimore supposed that the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> demonstrated a need to divide the nomadic way of life from the agricultural communities of China, and John K. Fairbank posited that the Wall played a part in upholding the Sinocentric world order.|$|E
5|$|With that, the Yuan dynasty, {{established}} by Genghis Khan's grandson Khublai Khan, {{became the first}} foreign dynasty to rule all of China. Despite being {{the head of the}} Mongol Empire, Khublai Khan's rule over China was not free from the threat of the steppe nomads. The Yuan dynasty faced challenges from rival claimants to the title of Great Khan and from rebellious Mongols in the north. Khublai Khan dealt with such threats by using both military blockades and economic sanctions. Although he established garrisons along the steppe frontier from the Juyan Lake Basin in the far west to Yingchang in the east, Khublai Khan and the Yuan emperors after him did not add to the <b>Great</b> <b>Wall</b> (except for the ornate Cloud Platform at Juyong Pass). When the Venetian traveller Marco Polo wrote of his experiences in China during the reign of Khublai Khan, he did not mention a <b>Great</b> <b>Wall.</b>|$|E
