2500|$|The hybrid concept re-emerged {{early in}} 1942 when, {{in the face}} of {{mounting}} losses from U-boat attacks, it became apparent that escort carriers building in the US could not be delivered quickly enough in the numbers required. Various people have been credited with re-inventing the idea, including Captain B. B. Schofield RN, Director Trade Division, and John Lamb, Marine Technical Manager of the Anglo-Saxon Petroleum Company. Sir James Lithgow, Controller of Merchant Shipbuilding and Repair and <b>joint-owner</b> of Lithgows Ltd, the Clyde-based shipbuilders, also helped overcome Admiralty reservations about MACs. [...] Lithgow is said to have sketched a rough design for one on the back of an envelope and offered to convert two ships about to be built at his family's shipyard on condition that [...] "I am not interfered with by the Admiralty". While the timing of Lithgow's possibly apocryphal intervention is uncertain, his deputy, Sir Amos Ayre, the Director of Merchant Shipbuilding, was certainly discussing the requirements for MACs by May 1942. [...] Ayre himself credits Sir Douglas Thomson of Ben Line and the Ministry of War Transport with having first suggested the idea.|$|E

Considering that with two legs man {{is but a}} hobbling wight in all times of danger; considering that the pursuit of whales is always under great and extraordinary difficulties; that every individual moment, indeed, then comprises a peril; under these circumstances is it wise for any maimed man to enter a whale-boat in the hunt?

500|$|Although {{used as a}} [...] "successful brand", Greater Manchester's {{politics}} have been characterised by [...] "entrenched localism and related rivalries", historically resistant to regionalism. The major towns in Greater Manchester retain a [...] "fierce independence", meaning Greater Manchester is administered using [...] "inter-municipal coordination" [...] on a broadly voluntary basis. That eight of the ten borough councils have (for the most part) been Labour-controlled since 1986, has helped maintain this informal co-operation between the districts at a county-level. After {{the abolition of the}} county council, the ten authorities of Greater Manchester co-operated voluntarily on policy issues like Local Transport Plans as well as funding the Greater Manchester County Record Office, and local services were administered by statutory joint boards. Now {{under the direction of the}} Greater Manchester Combined Authority, these joint boards are Transport for Greater Manchester (TfGM) which is responsible for planning and co-ordinating public transport across the county; the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service, who are administered by a joint Fire and Rescue Authority; and the Greater Manchester Waste Disposal Authority. These joint boards are made up of councillors appointed from each of the ten boroughs (except the Waste Disposal Authority, which does not include the Metropolitan Borough of Wigan). Greater Manchester Police was formerly overseen by a joint police authority, but is now overseen by the Greater Manchester Police and Crime Commissioner owing to reforms introduced in 2012. The ten borough councils are <b>joint-owners</b> of the Manchester Airport Group which controls Manchester Airport and three other UK airports. Other services are directly funded and managed by the local councils.|$|R

5000|$|Under the new {{management}} of Iain Dowie, Mahon and QPR began the 2008-09 campaign with five victories {{in their first}} six matches. However, Dowie was sacked after just 15 matches despite having the highest win percentage of any QPR manager. Mahon scored his first goal {{of the season in}} a 1-0 home victory over Cardiff City in November 2008, coming on as a 67th-minute substitute, before scoring a headed goal against a nine-man Cardiff side with just ten-minute remaining. The goal was highlighted in the BBC documentary The Four Year Plan, as <b>joint-owner</b> Flavio Briatore ordered sporting director Gianni Paladini into [...] "going down to the touchline to order caretaker manager Gareth Ainsworth to bring Gavin Mahon off the bench. Mahon promptly scores a last gasp winner and Briatore, his football genius now proven, erupts in a mixture of self-righteous anger and joy in the directors’ box". His second goal of the season came in April 2009, scoring with a diving header to equalise proceedings after QPR had trailed by two goals to Sheffield Wednesday — with Mahon atoning for his earlier own goal. QPR {{went on to win the}} match 3-2, all of their goals coming in the last half-hour of the match.
