5|$|In 1944, {{writing as}} Major Harold Ridley FRCS RAMC, the English {{ophthalmic}} surgeon published a short {{paper in the}} British Journal of Ophthalmology on spitting snakes and {{an account of the}} composition and action of snake venom in general. From his own experiences in wartime Ghana, then known as the Gold Coast, Ridley described snake venom ophthalmia in a 30-year-old labourer named Gogi Kumasi, who was cutting grass when a Black-necked cobra raised its head <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> and forcibly spat venom toward the man's right eye from a four- or five-feet distance. Ridley treated the man and followed his case until the eye had fully recoveredafter about a week. In conclusion, after discussion on the therapeutic uses of snake venom, he conjectured that in the future diluted venom or a constituent of venom might be used as a powerful anaesthetic in some cases of ophthalmic surgery.|$|E

25|$|Flannels were {{originally}} {{made from a}} variety of flannel materials. Typically, modern flannels will have trousers made with a high elastic content, to prevent damage while fielding. Shirts and jumpers can be short or long-sleeved, the former being particularly favoured by bowlers. Wicketkeepers mostly wear long-sleeved shirts, in order to avoid abrasions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> when diving for the ball. Jumpers are traditionally made with a cable-knit design.|$|E
25|$|Political and {{economic}} power remain vested {{in the hands of}} the local elite, most of whom are either white, light-skinned Creole, or Mestizo. The sizable middle group is composed of peoples of different ethnic backgrounds. This middle group does not constitute a unified social class, but rather a number of middle-class and working-class groups, loosely oriented around shared dispositions toward education, cultural respectability, and possibilities for upward social mobility. These beliefs and the social practices they engender, help distinguish the middle group <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> roots majority of the Belizean people.|$|E

The auction lasted for seven hours and 1,000 supporters attended the auction with interest from clubs such as Preston North End and Norwich City for the bigger lots which could be reused.|$|E
25|$|Elasmotherium ("Thin Plate Beast"), {{also known}} as the Giant Rhinoceros of Siberia, is an extinct genus of {{rhinoceros}} endemic to Eurasia during the Late Pliocene through the Pleistocene, documented from 2.6 Ma to as late as 29,000years ago in the Late Pleistocene. Three species are recognised. The best known, E. sibiricum, {{was the size of a}} mammoth and is thought to have borne a large, thick horn on its forehead. Theories about the function of this horn include defence, attracting mates, driving away competitors, sweeping snow <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> in winter and digging for water and plant roots. Like all rhinoceroses, elasmotheres were herbivorous. Unlike any others, its high-crowned molars were ever-growing. Its legs were longer than those of other rhinos and were adapted for galloping, giving it a horse-like gait.|$|E
25|$|The alcephine bovids (wildebeests, hartebeests, hirola, bontebok, blesbok, {{and several}} similar species) have preorbital glands which secrete complex {{mixtures}} of chemical compounds. The preorbital glands of the bontebok (Damaliscus pygargus pygarus) are larger in males than in females. Their secretions contain at least forty different chemical compounds, and are deposited on grass and twigs at {{the borders of}} their territory. They then appear to transfer the secretions <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> to their horns and forehead by waving the {{head from side to}} side across the stalk bearing the secretion. Marking of plant stalks with preorbital gland secretions is seen in both sexes. In contrast to the duikers and raphicerids, the klipspringer (Oreotragus oreotragus) is a semi-gregarious species, while the hirola (Beatragus hunteri) is fully gregarious. Nevertheless, these animals display territorial scent marking of grasses with secretions from their preorbital glands.|$|E

25|$|Carrying {{over from}} the {{previous}} season, Josep Gombau was quick to implement a possession-based football style at Adelaide, all the way <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> roots level of local football to the senior side. Gombau further reinforced his dogmatic approach by bringing in FC Barcelona legend Guillermo Amor as the club's technical director. While winning the Adelaide fans over, Josep elevated the technical and tactical quality of the local brand, earning the respect and admiration of rival clubs, coaches and the FFA, who unanimously voted him in {{as coach of the}} A-League All Stars team for the 2014 A-League All Stars Game against the visiting Juventus. Gombau's United won the inaugural FFA Cup with a 1–0 win against Perth Glory. Gombau left the club in July 2015 to take up a youth coaching role in the United States.|$|E
25|$|A {{member of}} the loline {{alkaloids}} was first isolated <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> Lolium temulentum and its elemental composition determined in 1892. It was initially named temuline and later renamed norloline. (Reviewed by Schardl et al. (2007).) Studies in the 1950s and 1960s by Russian researchers established the name loline and identified the characteristic 2,7 ether bridge in its molecular structure. Since then the analytical methods for purification {{and analysis of the}} lolines have been refined and several different loline species have been identified in many Lolium and related grasses infected by the Epichloë/Neotyphodium (epichloae) endophytes. Lolines are absent in grass plants that do not harbor the epichloae endophytes, and not all epichloae produce the lolines. Because of the very intimate association of plant and endophyte and difficulties to reproduce the symbiotic conditions in vitro, it was long unknown if the fungus was the producer of the lolines, or if they were synthesized by the plant in response to endophyte infection. In 2001, it was demonstrated that the endophyte Neotyphodium uncinatum produces lolines in some chemically defined growth media, which suggests that the endophyte is also the producer of the lolines in the grass plant. The lolines have also been reported from some plants in several plant families, suggesting a more widespread occurrence of these compounds in nature.|$|E

500|$|Songs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grass</b> String Ranch, the band's next album, was {{completed}} almost 18 months before its release. The band had consulted with 38 different independent labels before signing to Audium Entertainment, {{a branch of}} Koch Records (now E1 Music), which released the album in 2000. Three months before its release, Richard suffered a heart attack, from which he soon recovered. Because the [...] "Singing the Blues" [...] cover had been unsuccessful, the group decided to record entirely original songs for Songs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grass</b> String Ranch. All five members co-wrote all of the songs, with assistance from Verlon Dale Grissom on four of them. In addition, this album featured the Youngs on lead vocals for the first time: Fred on [...] "Dry-Land Fish" [...] and Richard on [...] "Louisianna CoCo." [...] The title track {{was inspired by a}} nickname given to the Youngs' family farm. [...] "Too Much to Lose" [...] was the album's first single, peaking at number 66 on Billboard country chart. Richard considered this song an unusual single release because it was the band's first ballad. Neither of the next two singles, [...] "Louisianna CoCo" [...] and [...] "Love That Woman," [...] appeared on the music charts. Giving it three stars out of five, Al Campbell of Allmusic said that it was [...] "crowd-pleasing" [...] but [...] "nothing out of the ordinary." [...] An uncredited review in The Ledger, which gave the album two-and-a-half stars out of four, said that the up-tempo songs were [...] "nothing very originalbut lots of fun" [...] but added that its ballads were [...] "mushy and earnest." ...|$|E

500|$|The band's {{sound is}} {{influenced}} by country music, blues, Southern rock, and heavy metal, and {{has been described as}} [...] "guitar-heavy, rambunctious music." [...] Lead singer Doug Phelps' voice has been described as [...] "alternately suggest Count Basie's storied blues shouter Jimmy Rushing and the laid-back cool of Eagle Glenn Frey." [...] The band's combination of styles is most notable in its cover song choices on early albums. All three Mercury albums contain a Bill Monroe cover, and other covers on these albums include Waylon Jennings, Carl Perkins, Norman Greenbaum and The Lovin' Spoonful. Soul showcased the band's blues and R influences through its use of Hammond organ and a horn section. The band's original compositions, such as [...] "Dumas Walker" [...] and the title track to Songs <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Grass</b> String Ranch, often develop a regional theme.|$|E

500|$|To {{the left}} of Dog Green sat Dog White, between the Vierville and Les Moulins strongpoints (defending draws D-1 and D-3); and here was a {{different}} story. As a result of earlier mis-landings, and now because of their own mis-landing, the troops of C/116 found themselves alone at Dog White, {{with a handful of}} tanks from the first wave in sight. The smoke <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>grass</b> fires covering their advance up the beach, they gained the seawall with few casualties, and were in better shape than any unit on the 116th RCT front so far. Although the 1st Battalion was effectively disarmed of its heavy weapons when D/116 suffered a disastrous landing, the buildup at Dog White continued. C/116 was joined by the 5th Ranger Battalion almost in its entirety. The Ranger commander, recognizing the situation at Dog Green on the run-in, ordered the assault craft to divert into Dog White. Like the C/116, the smoke covered their advance, although the 2nd Rangers were caught out on the right flank of the Ranger's landing. This was where the 116th RCT regimental command group, including the 29th Division assistant commander Brigadier General Norman [...] "Dutch" [...] Cota, was able to land relatively unscathed.|$|E
