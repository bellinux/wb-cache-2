In the night's main event, he and Austin were defending the WWF Tag Team Championship against Chris Jericho and Chris Benoit. At one point, Jericho had Austin trapped in the Walls of Jericho and Triple H ran in to break it up, but just as he did, {{he suffered a}} tear in his left quadriceps muscle, causing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> completely off the bone. Despite his inability to place any weight on his leg, Triple H was able to complete the match. He even allowed Jericho {{to put him in}} the Walls of Jericho, a move that places considerable stress on the quadriceps. The tear required an operation, which was performed by orthopedic surgeon Dr. James Andrews. This injury brought an abrupt end to the McMahon-Helmsley Era, as the rigorous rehabilitation process kept Triple H out of action for over eight months, completely missing The Invasion storyline.|$|E

In 1998, Berry received {{praise for}} her role in Bulworth as an intelligent woman raised by activists who gives a politician (Warren Beatty) a new lease on life. The same year, she played the singer Zola Taylor, one of the three wives of pop singer Frankie Lymon, in the biopic Why Do Fools Fall in Love. In the 1999 HBO biopic Introducing Dorothy Dandridge, she portrayed {{the first black woman to}} be nominated for the Academy Award for Best Actress, and it was to Berry a heart-felt project that she introduced, co-produced and fought intensely for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> through. Berry's performance was recognized with several awards, including a Primetime Emmy Award and Golden Globe Award.|$|E

25|$|The {{run-up to}} the concert itself still did not go smoothly. Rain poured down on Houston {{a couple of days}} before the concert, {{destroying}} much of the equipment on stage (which was repaired by the day of the concert), breaking wires and ruining instruments.

25|$|After {{spending}} {{several months}} there, watched by the blockading British fleet under Nelson, Villeneuve {{decided to put}} to sea in mid-October. Valdés prepared Neptuno for sea, and the fleet sailed from Cadiz on 19 October. Neptuno was initially the rearmost ship of the combined fleet as it sailed southwards, but as the British approached {{on the morning of}} 21 October, Villeneuve formed the line of battle and ordered <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> about heading northwards, with Neptuno now the lead ship of the van. She was ahead of the 74-gun French Scipion, and formed part of the squadron under Rear-Admiral Pierre Dumanoir le Pelley, which had previously been intended as the rear of the fleet.|$|E
25|$|The play most {{directly}} {{analogous to the}} Miracle involved a player's, rather than a coach's, questionable decision that cost his team a game. On Thanksgiving Day 1993, the Cowboys were playing their customary holiday contest, this time against the visiting Dolphins, in sleet. As the clock ticked down, Dallas appeared to have won when it blocked a 41-yard Miami field goal. But as several Dolphins players were gathered around the ball, waiting for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to rest in order to down it {{as close as possible}} to the Dallas goal, Dallas defensive end Leon Lett sprinted downfield to try to recover it. He slipped on the slick surface and touched the ball. His touch meant that it became a live ball and Miami was able to recover at the Dallas 1 and kick a field goal for a 16–14 victory.|$|E

25|$|A {{voyage to}} explore {{the east coast of}} New Holland, with a view to a British {{colonization}} of the country, had been recommended in John Campbell’s editions of John Harris's Navigantium atque Itinerantium Bibliotheca, or Voyages and Travels (1744–1748, and 1764), a book which Cook had with him on the Endeavour: The first Point, with respect to a Discovery, would be, to send a small Squadron on the Coast of Van Diemen's Land, and from thence round, in the same course taken by Captain Tasman, by the Coast of New Guiney; which might enable the Nations that attempted <b>it,</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to an absolute Certainty with regard to its Commodities and Commerce... By this means all the back Coast of New Holland, and New Guiney, might be roughly examined; and we might know as well, and as certainly, as the Dutch, how far a Colony settled there might answer our Expectations.|$|E
25|$|Arthur Weasley owned a 1960 Ford Anglia 105E that he {{subsequently}} enchanted; consequently, {{the vehicle}} can fly, become invisible, and carry the entire Weasley family {{in spite of}} its formerly non-enchanted interior dimensions (also the Undetectable Extension Charm), among other abilities. In Harry Potter and the Chamber of Secrets, the car is borrowed by Fred, George and Ron, who use it to rescue Harry from the Dursleys' house. Ron and Harry later steal the car in order to return to Hogwarts after the gate to Platform 9¾ is sealed by Dobby. After they arrive at school, landing in the Whomping Willow, the car ejects Harry, Ron, and their luggage, then flees into the Forbidden Forest, ignoring Ron's pleas for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back. Mr Weasley soon faces an inquiry at the Ministry of Magic, as seven Muggles saw the car flying across the countryside, and is forced to pay a large fine.|$|E
25|$|Aware {{that the}} people on Clorinde would swamp his boat if he drew {{alongside}} the frigate, possibly drowning all concerned, Willoughby instead commandeered a punt and used <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> aboard the frigate. Once on board, Willoughby persuaded La Poype to surrender the ship without the formalities observed outside the harbour, raising the Union Flag. The Haitians were consequently unable to fire on a ship in possession of their ally, Willoughby going ashore to meet with Dessalines, who promised assistance. Willoughby returned {{with a number of}} boats crewed by Haitians and was joined by several British boats in anticipation of removing the crew and passengers from the stricken ship. On his return however, Willoughby discovered that the wind had fallen significantly, allowing him to use the boats instead to haul Clorinde off the rocks and into deeper water. Her hull was still intact, and by the evening Clorinde had joined the rest of the British squadron off the mouth of the harbour.|$|E

25|$|On 4 January 1974, Harry Schwarz met and had {{discussions with}} Gatsha (later Mangosuthu) Buthelezi, Chief Executive Councillor {{of the black}} {{homeland}} of KwaZulu. They agreed on a five-point plan for racial peace in South Africa that {{became known as the}} Mahlabatini Declaration of Faith. The declaration's purpose was to provide a blueprint for government of South Africa for racial peace in South Africa. It called for negotiations involving all peoples, in order to draw up constitutional proposals stressing opportunity for all with a Bill of Rights to safeguard these rights. It suggested that the federal concept was the appropriate framework for such changes to take place. It also first affirmed that political change must take place though non-violent means. The concept of a non-discriminatory society had been outlined in the 'Act of Dedication' of 1973 that Schwarz had written, while Leader of the Opposition in the Transvaal. Schwarz had called for the Transvaal and South Africa to adopt and subscribe to the act. While the United Party Transvaal caucus unanimously adopted the initiative, the National Party refused for <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to debate. The principles of the act were adopted at the 1973 National United Party Congress.|$|E
25|$|Now {{left with}} only seven of his {{original}} jeeps, Farran pressed on, {{the remainder of the}} troopers strafing a passing goods train, puncturing the boiler on its engine and forcing <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to a halt. Eventually they linked up with Grant-Hibbert's men after one final encounter during their journey, assaulting a German radar station and causing the German garrison to flee; prisoners informed the SAS troopers that they believed the jeeps to be the advance guard of General George S. Patton's United States Third Army. Farran took command of the combined group, which consisted of a composite squadron of 60 troopers, 10 jeeps and a civilian truck, and ordered it to move to another base to avoid further German scrutiny. The squadron roamed around until the end of August, assaulting German troop convoys and facilities, and then split into three groups to maximise the area they could cover and the damage that could be dealt to the German forces. Throughout their entire time behind German lines they were supplied by the Royal Air Force in 36 sorties, which supplied by the SAS with 12 new jeeps and 36 supply panniers. Operation Wallace came to an end on 17 September, when the groups linked up with advance elements of the United States Seventh Army; during the month they had been active, Farran and his men had caused more than 500 German casualties, destroyed some 95 enemy vehicles and more than 100,000 gallons of petrol. 17 SAS troopers had been lost, including one in a parachuting accident, as well as 16 jeeps. After linking up with the American forces, Farran sent the squadron back to Paris and granted it a week's leave in the capital, despite it officially being out of bounds to all British troops. As a result of these actions, Farran was awarded a Distinguished Service Order, which unusually was awarded under the pseudonym of 'Patrick McGinty'; Farran had used the name since his escape from German captivity in 1941, and claimed that the name was a reference to an Irish song.|$|E

Mason was less influential in his final session in the House of Delegates because of his strong opposition to ratification, and his age (61) may also have caused him to be less effective.|$|E
500|$|The {{meaning of}} the name Faramir was not {{explained}} by Tolkien; apparently he intended <b>it</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> from Sindarin, an Elven language constructed by him and stated to {{have been used by}} the Stewards of Gondor for naming. The first part of Faramir could have been derived from Sindarin stems meaning 'suffice' and 'hunt', and the final syllable is likely to have been the same as in his brother's name. Boromir was described by Tolkien as a name [...] "of mixed form", and possibly combines Sindarin bor(on)- 'steadfast' with either Sindarin mîr or Quenya míre 'jewel'. However, it is also stated that the Stewards of Gondor often bore names [...] "remembered in the songs and histories of the First Age", without paying a special attention to meaning. Thus one Boromir appears in The Silmarillion, and the appendices to The Lord of the Rings introduce Faramir, son of King Ondoher of Gondor, although in this case the name was supposedly in Quenya, as the Kings are stated to have borne High-elven names, and similarly did Ondoher's elder son, Artamir.|$|E
