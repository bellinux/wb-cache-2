25|$|Since Calendar Round dates repeat every 18,980 days, {{approximately}} 52 solar years, {{the cycle}} repeats roughly once each lifetime, so a more refined method of dating was needed <b>if</b> <b>history</b> {{was to be}} recorded accurately.

25|$|Sunnis {{believe that}} Abu Bakr is the {{rightful}} Caliph. The Twelver Shia and the Ismaili Shia believe that Ali {{should have been}} the first Caliph. Their main argument is based on their interpretation of Hadith of the pond of Khumm. However, later a minority, took this concept one step further and also started thinking, what <b>if</b> <b>history</b> took a different course and these ideas were later adopted by some Twelver Shia and institutionalised by the Safavids in the 1500s. For {{the first time in the}} history of Islam, the Safavids also established a hierarchical organization of the Shiite clergy and funded this hierarchy through the collection of waqf and Khums. Because of the relative insecurity of property ownership in Persia, many private landowners secured their lands by donating them to the clergy as so called vaqf. They would thus retain the official ownership and secure their land from being confiscated by royal commissioners or local governors, as long as a percentage of the revenues from the land went to the ulama the quasi-religious organizations run by dervishes (futuvva). Increasingly, members of the religious class, particularly the mujtahids and the seyyeds, gained full ownership of these lands, and, according to contemporary historian Iskandar Munshi, Persia started to witness the emergence of a new and significant group of landowners. From then on many seyyeds also further propagated the idea that Ali {{should have been the}} first caliph and that by becoming the first caliph, Abu Bakr had broken the link that proved that they should have more rights. Before that point Jafar al-Sadiq disapproved of people who disapproved of his great grand father Abu Bakr the first caliph.|$|E

500|$|Critics {{at first}} {{compared}} Stelmach to Harry Strom, the last Social Credit premier of the province. [...] Strom {{was regarded as}} honest but ineffective and lacking charisma; he survived only long enough as Premier to lose the 1971 election soundly.

2500|$|Other {{conditions}} {{may also be}} misdiagnosed as carpal tunnel syndrome. Thus, <b>if</b> <b>history</b> and physical examination suggest CTS, patients will sometimes be tested electrodiagnostically with nerve conduction studies and electromyography. The role of confirmatory nerve conduction studies is controversial. [...] The goal of electrodiagnostic testing is to compare the speed of conduction in the median nerve with conduction in other nerves supplying the hand. [...] When the median nerve is compressed, as in CTS, it will conduct more slowly than normal and more slowly than other nerves. [...] There are many electrodiagnostic tests {{used to make a}} diagnosis of CTS, but the most sensitive, specific, and reliable test is the Combined Sensory Index (also known as the Robinson index). [...] Electrodiagnosis rests upon demonstrating impaired median nerve conduction across the carpal tunnel in context of normal conduction elsewhere. Compression results in damage to the myelin sheath and manifests as delayed latencies and slowed conduction velocities [...] However, normal electrodiagnostic studies do not preclude the presence of carpal tunnel syndrome, as a threshold of nerve injury must be reached before study results become abnormal and cut-off values for abnormality are variable. [...] Carpal tunnel syndrome with normal electrodiagnostic tests is very, very mild at worst.|$|E

Of this temper we have a curious illustration in the circumstance that Dupont, Turgot's intimate friend of later years, who collected and published his works, actually took the trouble to suppress the opening of this very Discourse, in which Turgot had replied to the reproach often made against Christianity, of being useful only for a future life.[32] ...|$|E
