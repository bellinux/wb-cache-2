5|$|Also in 2002, DiCaprio {{appeared}} in Martin Scorsese's <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, a historical film {{set in the}} mid-19th century in the Five Points district of New York City. Director Scorsese initially struggled selling his idea of realizing the film until DiCaprio became interested in playing protagonist Amsterdam Vallon, a young leader of the Irish faction, and thus, Miramax Films got involved with financing the project. Nonetheless production on the film was plagued by blown-out budgets and producer-director squabbles, resulting in a marathon eight-month shoot and, at US$103 million, the most expensive film Scorsese had ever made. Upon its release, <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York became a financial and critical success. DiCaprio's acting was well-received but was overshadowed by Daniel Day-Lewis' performance among most critics.|$|E
5|$|In 2002, DiCaprio played con-artist Frank Abagnale, Jr. {{opposite}} Tom Hanks in the Steven Spielberg-directed biographical crime-drama Catch Me If You Can {{and also}} {{starred in the}} Martin Scorsese-directed historical period drama <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York. He founded his own production company, Appian Way, in 2004. The next two films he starred in were both directed by Scorsese: the Howard Hughes biopic The Aviator (2004) and the crime drama The Departed (2006). For his portrayal of Hughes in the former, DiCaprio won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actor– Motion Picture Drama and garnered his first nomination for the Academy Award for Best Actor.|$|E

5|$|Scorsese's complex filmmaking {{commitments}} to multiple film projects {{resulted in an}} early legal challenge before filming of Silence could be initiated. In August 2012, Cecchi Gori Pictures sued Scorsese over an alleged breach of contract agreements related to Silence. According to the company, in 1990 Scorsese signed a written agreement to direct Silence. Scorsese was supposed to shoot the film following 1997's Kundun, and Cecchi Gori Pictures had apparently invested more than $750,000 for this purpose. However, Scorsese chose to make Bringing Out the Dead, <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York, and The Aviator first.|$|E
5|$|Verbinski cast James Gandolfini as Carl Hanratty, Ed Harris as Frank Abagnale, Sr., and Chloë Sevigny as Brenda Strong. Verbinski {{dropped out}} because of DiCaprio's {{commitment}} on <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York. Lasse Hallström was in negotiations to direct by May 2001, but dropped out in July 2001. At this stage Harris and Sevigny left the film, but Gandolfini was still attached. Spielberg, co-founder of DreamWorks, offered the job of director to Miloš Forman, and considered hiring Cameron Crowe. During this negotiation period, Spielberg began to consider directing the film himself, eventually dropping projects such as Big Fish and Memoirs of a Geisha. Spielberg officially committed to directing in August 2001.|$|E
5|$|Since 2000, DiCaprio has {{received}} critical acclaim {{for his work}} {{in a wide range of}} film genres.

This was followed by his film debut in the direct-to-video feature Critters 3 (1991). He played a mentally challenged boy in the drama What's Eating Gilbert Grape (1993), a role that earned him nominations for the Academy Award and Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actor. Three years later, he appeared in Romeo + Juliet, for which he earned a Best Actor award from the Berlin International Film Festival. DiCaprio featured opposite Kate Winslet in the romantic drama Titanic (1997), the highest-grossing film to that point. For the film, he garnered the MTV Movie Award for Best Male Performance and his first Golden Globe Award for Best Actor nomination.

25|$|With a {{production}} budget {{said to be}} in excess of $100 million, <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York was Scorsese's biggest and arguably most mainstream venture to date. Like The Age of Innocence, it was set in 19th-century New York, although focusing {{on the other end of}} the social scale (and like that film, also starring Daniel Day-Lewis). The film also marked the first collaboration between Scorsese and actor Leonardo DiCaprio, who since then has become a fixture in later Scorsese films. The production was highly troubled, with many rumors referring to the director's conflict with Miramax boss Harvey Weinstein. Despite denials of artistic compromise, <b>Gangs</b> <b>of</b> <b>New</b> York revealed itself to be the director's most conventional film: standard film tropes that the director had traditionally avoided, such as characters existing purely for exposition purposes and explanatory flashbacks, here surfaced in abundance. The original score composed by regular Scorsese collaborator Elmer Bernstein was rejected at a late stage for a score by Howard Shore and mainstream rock artists U2 and Peter Gabriel.|$|E
