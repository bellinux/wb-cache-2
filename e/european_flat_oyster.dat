5000|$|Ostrea edulis is {{a species}} of oyster native to Europe and {{commonly}} known as the <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster,</b> Colchester native oyster (hence Colchester natives), mud oyster, or edible oyster (despite this latter name {{it is not the only}} oyster that is edible by humans).|$|E
50|$|A {{study in}} the Netherlands of the {{epidemiology}} of <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters,</b> Ostrea edulis, infected with Bonamia ostreae showed that the parasite was present throughout the year and was detected in all oyster weight classes. The study analyzed the prevalence relative to O. edulis density, biomass {{and a range of}} environmental parameters. Prevalence was greatest in the largest oysters and was higher in spring than in the autumn, perhaps because of the mortality of these shellfish during the summer. Mortality seemed to be correlated with higher water temperatures and oysters seemed to be more susceptible to infection after seasons with lower food availability or lower salinity levels.|$|R

40|$|Bonamia sp. is a {{pathogenic}} parasite {{that occurs}} in the haemocytes of dredge oysters Ostrea chilensis Philippi in New Zealand. Ultrastructurally it resembles other haplosporidians {{in the possession of}} haplosporosomes, haplosporogenesis, persistence of mitotic microtubules during interphase and of the nuclear envelope during mitosis, and occurrence of a diplokaryotic or multi-nucleate plasmodial stage. Another stage containing a large vacuole derived from enlargement of 1 or more mitochondria has not previously been described from other haplosporidians. It most closely resembles B. ostreae Pichot et al., 1979, which parasitises and is pathogenic in haemocytes of <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters,</b> O. edulis. However, B. ostreae is smaller and denser, and has fewer lipoid bodies and haplosporosomes. We have nearly completely sequenced the small ribosomal gene of the organism from O. chilensis. Initial comparisons of these sequences with those of other protozoans showed similarities to B. ostreae. Polymorphism within Bonamia sp. was confirmed by restriction fragment length polymorphism analysis. On the basis of ultrastructural and molecular considerations it is proposed that this organism be named Bonamia exitiosus sp. nov. Source type: Electronic(1...|$|R
50|$|Bonamia ostreae is a {{parasitic}} Rhizaria in the phylum Haplosporidia {{that can}} cause lethal infections in shellfish, particularly the <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster,</b> Ostrea edulis. Infection in oysters rarely results in clinical signs of disease and often the only indication of the infection is increased mortality. The Australian flat oyster, Ostrea angasi, has been infected with two similar Bonamia parasites, Bonamia exitiosa and B. roughleyi.|$|E
50|$|Selection {{for live}} weight of Pacific oysters showed {{improvements}} ranging from 0.4% to 25.6% {{compared to the}} wild stock. Sydney-rock oysters (Saccostrea commercialis) showed a 4% increase after one generation and a 15% increase after two generations. Chilean oysters (Ostrea chilensis), selected for improvement in live weight and shell length showed a 10-13% gain in one generation.Bonamia ostrea is a protistan parasite that causes catastrophic losses (nearly 98%) in <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> Ostrea edulis L. This protistan parasite is endemic to three oyster-regions in Europe. Selective breeding programs show that O. edulis susceptibility to the infection differs across oyster strains in Europe. A study carried out by Culloty et al. showed that ‘Rossmore' oysters in Cork harbour, Ireland had better resistance compared to other Irish strains. A selective breeding program at Cork harbour uses broodstock from 3- to 4-year-old survivors and is further controlled until a viable percentage reaches market size. Over the years ‘Rossmore' oysters have shown to develop lower prevalence of B. ostreae infection and percentage mortality.Ragone Calvo et al. (2003) selectively bred the eastern oyster, Crassostrea virginica, for resistance against co-occurring parasites Haplosporidium nelson (MSX) and Perkinsus marinus (Dermo). They achieved dual resistance to the disease in four generations of selective breeding. The oysters showed higher growth and survival rates and low susceptibility to the infections. At {{the end of the}} experiment, artificially selected C. virginica showed a 34-48% higher survival rate.|$|E
40|$|Experts in {{the oyster}} supply chain (farmers, retailers, and gourmet chefs) in The Netherlands have {{suggested}} that the <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (Ostrea edulis) has superior sensory qualities compared to the Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas). However, scientific evidence is lacking. The aim {{of this study was to}} evaluate consumer preferences for these two oyster species and to determine the sensory properties of both species by consumers. Two-alternative forced choice tests were performed with the oysters involving a panel of 74 naïve consumers. No significant differences in preferences between the oyster species were observed by the consumers. Nine sensory attributes of both oyster species were evaluated. Consumers did not observe significant differences between species in the sensory attributes: overall odor intensity, sea odor, mud odor, sweetness, pungency, and firmness. The Pacific cupped oyster was perceived as significantly saltier and more intense in greenness than the <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster.</b> We concluded that only a few sensory properties of the <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> and the Pacific cupped oyster are perceived as being different by untrained consumers. </p...|$|E

40|$|Production of <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> Ostrea edulis in the Netherlands {{has been}} {{hampered}} {{by the presence of}} the haplosporidian parasite Bonamia ostreae, which is now an enzootic species following its establishment after 1980. We analyzed histopathological data from annual shellfish disease monitoring from 1988 to 2006 to quantify prevalence of B. ostreae in <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> stocks of the marine Lake Grevelingen. In addition, we estimated prevalence of B. ostreae on a monthly basis with field surveys in 2003. The parasite was detected with PCR, using specific primers for B. ostreae. Prevalence of B. ostreae was analyzed relative to O. edulis density, biomass and a range of environmental parameters. B. ostreae was detected in <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> throughout the year with a higher prevalence in spring than in autumn, possibly due to termination of spawning and the onset of oyster growth in autumn. Although B. ostreae was detected in all oyster weight classes, prevalence was highest in the largest oysters in spring and declined disproportionately in autumn, possibly due to high mortality of large oysters before autumn, suggesting that prevalence depends on oyster age. Parasite prevalence was independent of oyster density and total biomass, but appeared to be higher after a warm autumn. Abundance of the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (infected or non-infected with B. ostreae) was negatively related to the temperature of the preceding period, suggesting that mortality in <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> increased at higher water temperatures. Furthermore, O. edulis appeared to be more susceptible to B. ostreae after years with lower food availability and lower salinities (< 29. 5). B. ostreae may weaken the competitive ability of O. edulis relative to the introduced Pacific oyster Crassostrea gigas, particularly in years with high water temperatures. ...|$|R
40|$|Biological {{effects of}} {{microplastics}} {{on the health}} of bivalves have been demonstrated elsewhere, but ecological impacts on the biodiversity and ecosystem functioning of bivalve-dominated habitats are unknown. Thus, we exposed intact sediment cores containing <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> (Ostrea edulis) or blue mussels (Mytilus edulis) in seawater to two different densities (2. 5 or 25 µg L- 1) of biodegradable or conventional microplastics in outdoor mesocosms. We hypothesised that filtration rates of the bivalves, inorganic nitrogen cycling, primary productivity of sediment dwelling microphytobenthos, and the structure of invertebrate benthic assemblages would be influenced by microplastics. After 50 days, filtration by M. edulis was significantly less when exposed to 25 µg L- 1 of either type of microplastics, but there were no effects on ecosystem functioning or the associated invertebrate assemblages. Contrastingly, filtration by O. edulis significantly increased when exposed to 2. 5 or 25 µg L- 1 of microplastics, and porewater ammonium and biomass of benthic cyanobacteria decreased. Additionally the associated infaunal invertebrate assemblages differed, with significantly less polychaetes and more oligochaetes in treatments exposed to microplastics. These findings highlight the potential of microplastics to impact the functioning and structure of sedimentary habitats and show that such effects may depend on the dominant bivalve present...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of two important different geographical cultivation areas in the Netherlands (Eastern Scheldt and Lake Grevelingen) on the volatile organic compound (VOC) profile of <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (Ostrea edulis) and Pacific cupped oyster (Crassostrea gigas). Market size oysters were analyzed for biochemical composition (dry matter, ash, protein, lipid content and fatty acid profile) and VOCs from samples harvested in January and February. Significant differences in fatty acids and in VOC content were observed between the oyster species. The <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> was found to have a higher level of unsaturated fatty acids in comparison with Pacific cupped oysters.

Compared to T 2 -weighted images, theoretically the most appropriate for good anatomical description, T 1 -weighted images were more suited to gonad observation. The gonad development was quantified by the number of voxels with higher grey level. Larvae were then depicted in the intervalvar cavity of spawning females.

We first constructed a genetic-linkage map for each studied family and improved the existing genetic-linkage map for the <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> with a set of SNP markers. This latter map now combines the best accuracy and the best estimate of the genome coverage available for an oyster species. Secondly, by comparing the QTLs detected in this study with those previously published for O. edulis in similar experimental conditions, we identified several potential QTLs that were identical between the different families, and also new specific QTLs. We also detected, within the confidence interval of several QTL regions, some previously predicted candidate genes differentially expressed during an infection with B. ostreae, providing new candidate genome regions which should now be studied more specifically...|$|E
40|$|Bivalve {{molluscs}} {{represent an}} important source of cadmium exposure in humans, in particular oysters, because of their high filter feeding capability and high concentration of metal-binding metallothionein in tissues. In this study the authors investigated the difference in cadmium bioaccumulation in <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> harvested from production areas in the district of San Benedetto del Tronto (Ascoli Piceno province, Italy), as a function of their origin (farming or natural beds) and the time of gathering. The beds lie 3 nm off-shore at a depth of 20 - 40 m and are collected by dredging. In the farms, baskets are suspended in the water column 2. 5 - 3 nm offshore at a depth of 4 m. The authors analysed the results of cadmium monitoring plan carried out in oyster natural beds for a total of 15 samples collected from 2004 to 2012 and in two oyster farms for a total of 11 samples from 2009 to 2012. Although the few data did not allow to find a significant statistical association, they suggested two findings: i) cadmium concentration in oysters from natural beds seemed to be lower than in farmed oysters; and ii) in farmed oysters cadmium concentration even exceeded allowed maximum level for human consumption, in particular in autumn. The vertical stratification in the water column of phytoplankton and a cadmium dilution at oyster gonadal maturation might cause changes in oyster cadmium accumulation...|$|R
40|$|Three {{autochthonous}} {{species of}} Bivalve Molluscs were investigated in the Porto Pozzo lagoon (northern Sardinia, central-western Mediterranean Sea). Gametogenic cycle, Condition Indexes and biochemical {{composition of the}} grooved carpet-shell, Ruditapes decussatus, from local natural banks were studied during the period July 2009 -July 2010. All the factors examined showed a clear seasonal cycle, depending on the reproductive activity and on some environmental variables. Growth, Condition Index and proximate composition of the Mediterranean mussel, Mytilus galloprovincialis, cultured in the oligotrophic lagoon of Porto Pozzo were compared with those obtained in a typical eutrophic ecosystem (the Calich lagoon) and in a mesotrophic basin (the Tortolì lagoon). The trial {{was carried out in}} long-line systems in the three lagoons considered, from April to October 2010. The results obtained confirmed a high variability of the three coastal habitats and among the mussel groups cultured in each of them, simultaneously revealing excellent performances, in term of morphometric variables and Condition Index, of the molluscs grown in the Porto Pozzo lagoon. Finally, comparisons of the growth and survival rate of the <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> Ostrea edulis reared using three different experimental tools were performed at two depths. The trial was carried out in the long-line system of the Porto Pozzo basin between June and October 2011. The best results in terms of survival rate and growth performances were achieved at the lower depth of - 1 m, regardless of the experimental tools used. Given the results obtained, the observation that Porto Pozzo lagoon is an excellent area for Bivalve Molluscs culture can be supported. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{precarious}} {{status of}} <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> Ostrea edulis stocks in Europe is widely acknowledged. To build a scientific basis for oyster restoration, an elevated experimental reef stocked with O. edulis was established within Poole Bay (Dorset, UK). Oysters were out planted on twenty four oyster reef modules (80 cm above sea bed) and compared with oysters {{held on the}} sea bed close to each reef module {{to test the hypothesis}} that a reef habitat enhanced physiological performance. Filtration and respiration rates, condition index, haemolymph protein concentration, haemocyte counts and gonad maturation were measured as indicators of physiological performance. During the first 15 months of oyster reef deployment, water samples were collected at regular intervals at the sea bed and at a height of 80 cm from the sea bed to determine chlorophyll a concentration, total suspended solids and bacterial abundance. Total suspended solids were significantly higher at the sea bed than at 80 cm above the sea bed at every sampling interval, while bacterial abundance adjacent to the sea bed was significantly higher than 80 cm above the sea bed in August and November 2013 when temperature was 18 °C and 15 °C, respectively. The filtration rates of oysters varied with elevation (reef/sea bed) and months. Filtration rates of ‘reef oysters’ (oysters on elevated reefs) were significantly higher than ‘sea bed oysters’ (oysters held on the sea bed). Respiration rates varied among months but were not significantly affected by elevation (reef/sea bed). Elevation and month also affected the total number of haemocytes and the granulocyte population; reef oysters had significantly higher numbers of haemocytes than sea bed oysters. As current stocks of <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> (O. edulis) in Europe have declined in both abundance and distribution, the results of this pilot study suggest that the culture of oysters on elevated reef structure represents at least a partial solution to improve O. edulis physiology for restoration in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Norwegian {{populations of}} <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters,</b> Ostrea edulis, have been {{considered}} free from notifiable diseases. In 2006, microcells resembling the oyster parasite Bonamia sp. were observed during histopathological examination of tissue specimens of <b>flat</b> <b>oysters,</b> Ostrea edulis from the Arendal area, southern Norway. In 2008, the EU reference laboratory received samples from the Norwegian Veterinary Institute, and reported one Bonamia sp. in a haemocyte from one oyster. By real-time PCR, positive results were obtained from two oysters in one triplicate sample. Sequencing of the PCR products gave 100 % identity with B. ostreae. After this diagnose, both the Norwegian Veterinary Institute and The Institute of Marine Research have monitored the population. The observed microcells have been observed since the sampling at the site was initiated, always at a low prevalence and intensity. No inflammation, pathology or reductions of the oyster's condition {{have been associated with}} the observation. The population appears healthy, with a normal reproductive cycle pattern. Several cohorts have been present throughout the study period. Since 2009, more than 2 200 oysters have been examined by histology, and samples from 581 of the oysters have been analyzed by PCR, all with negative results. The situation has thus been stable since 2006. A 10 years long sub-clinical Bonamia infection seems unlikely. If the diagnosis from 2009 is correct, Bonamia must be present at a very low prevalence, escaping PCR detection due to the sample sizes in the present study and living in co-existence with the oysters, thus not killing its host. One possible explanation is that the observed cells are not closely related to Bonamia ostreae, but another organism not detected by the assays used. We will perform a new extraction of DNA from haemocytes during spring and summer 2016, when the microcells are presumably present. As the situation has been unchanged for 10 years, {{there is no need to}} sample 150 oysters every six months. The sample size may be reduced to 60.

The filtration rates of oysters varied with elevation (reef/sea bed) and months. Filtration rates of reef oysters were significantly higher than sea bed oysters. Respiration rates varied among months but were not significantly affected by elevation. Elevation and month also affected the total number of haemocytes and the granulocyte population; reef oysters had significantly higher numbers of haemocytes than sea bed oysters. Althought geographical variation in filtration rate was also observed, this study suggested that the improved physiology of reef oysters in summer was still notable when comparing between different populations. An increase in filtration rate for reef oysters may, however, increase the likelihood of uptake of the protozoan parasite, Bonamia sp [...] However, haemocyte and haemolymph protein data suggested that there was no differential impact on physiology between reef and sea bed oysters as a result of Bonamia sp. infection. Fifty-four epifaunal species including oyster spat were found on oyster valves in reef boxes whilst only 23 species with no oyster spat were found on oyster valves in oyster cages laid on sea bed. The epifaunal community on oyster valves on reefs was significantly different from those sea bed valves but also had some species in common. Sixty-five mobile species were observed in reef boxes, whilst 47 species were recorded in oyster cages. These differences in faunal communities observed on the elevated reefs and sea bed implied that the presence of elevated reef habitats created by O. edulis valves can enhance or accelerate local diversity in Poole Bay. As current stocks of <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> (O. edulis) in Europe have declined in both abundance and distribution, the results of this pilot study suggest that the culture of oysters on elevated reef structure represents at least a partial solution to improve O. edulis physiology for restoration in Europe...|$|R

40|$|Abstract – The {{presented}} study focusses on {{the current}} situation of the <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (i. e., Ostrea edulis) within an ecosystem, its development and decline during past centuries and the habitat conditions nescacary to survive. Among these conditions substrate quality proofed {{to be an important}} factor for the colonization of oyster larvae, literature research revealed that cultch (e. g., scallops) and non-CACO 3 materials (e. g., concrete and granite) are among the most viable substrates for oyster reef restoration. The more feasible offshore conditions in windfarms create optimal situations for reef recovery in combination with Aquaculture, Integrated Multi-Trophic (IMTA). The combination of Windfarms and IMTA can be a first step towards oyster reef restoration in the North Sea by creating the assumed right conditions for oyster growth and survival.

Once baseline responses to acclimation temperature had been established, the effects of an in vivo inoculation on haemocyte lysosomal stability were assessed using the NRR assay. Lysosomal membrane stability was reduced in the presence of bacteria for all three species of bivalve, but destabilisation of C. gigas haemocyte lysosomes appeared to be most sensitive to the presence of the bacterium Listonella anguillarum. For all three bivalve species, the reduction in lysosomal stability appeared to be proportional to the growth of the bacterial inoculate. Using appropriate controls, the NRR assay was demonstrated to have great potential as a tool with which to make rapid initial assessments of the immune status of bivalve molluscs...|$|E
40|$|This is {{the first}} study that {{presents}} concentrations of domoic acid detected in the whole shellfish tissue from breeding and harvesting areas along the Croatian coast of the Adriatic Sea during the period 2006 to 2008. Shellfish sample analyses after SAX cleaning procedures, using a UV-DAD-HPLC system, showed the presence of domoic acid in four species. The most prevalent of those species were the blue mussel (Mytilus galloprovincialis), followed by <b>European</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (Ostrea edulis), Mediterranean scallop (Pecten jacobaeus) and proteus scallop (Flexopecten proteus). Domoic acid, a potentially lethal phycotoxin that causes amnesic shellfish poisoning (ASP), was detected {{for the first time}} in January 2006 with the highest value of 6. 5486 μg g- 1 in whole shellfish tissue. Pseudo-nitzschia spp. bloom events preceded these high domoic acid concentrations. According to this study, retention of domoic acid in the blue mussel M. galloprovincialis is more than 42 days. This investigation indicates the first presence of domoic acid in Croatian shellfish, but in concentrations under the regulatory limit (20 μg g- 1), therefore shellfish consumption was not found to endanger human health...|$|E
40|$|Stocks of the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> (Ostrea edulis) have {{declined}} throughout their entire geographical range, principally due to anthropogenic overexploitation. Strangford Lough in north-east Ireland sup-ported a productive <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> fishery until the population crashed {{at the turn}} of the century. A survey of <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> resources in Strangford Lough has revealed that a small population still exists, although the origin of the stock is not apparent. Spatfall on natural cultch occurred at low levels in 1997. Natural recruitment of oysters in Strangford Lough may be limited by the availability of suitable substratum. Although the hydrographic conditions in the north of Strangford Lough are ideal for oyster bed reclamation, any development programme would require a large-scale accumulation of broodstock and suitable substratum.

40|$|Apoptosis is a {{fundamental}} feature {{in the development of}} many organisms and tissue systems. It is also a mechanism of host defense against environmental stress factors or pathogens by contributing to the elimination of infected cells. Hemocytes {{play a key role in}} defense mechanisms in invertebrates and previous studies have shown that physical or chemical stress can increase apoptosis in hemocytes in mollusks. However this phenomenon has rarely been investigated in bivalves especially in the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> Ostrea edulis. The apoptotic response of hemocytes from <b>flat</b> <b>oysters,</b> O. edulis, was investigated after exposure to UV and dexamethasone, two agents known to induce apoptosis in vertebrates. Flow cytometry and microscopy were combined to demonstrate that apoptosis occurs in <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> hemocytes. Investigated parameters like intracytoplasmic calcium activity, mitochondrial membrane potential and phosphatidyl-serine externalization were significantly modulated in cells exposed to UV whereas dexamethasone only induced an increase of DNA fragmentation. Morphological changes were also observed on UV-treated cells using fluorescence microscopy and transmission electron microscopy. Our results confirm the apoptotic effect of UV on hemocytes of O. edulis and suggest that apoptosis is an important mechanism developed by the <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> against stress factors...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMollusc {{aquaculture}} is {{an important}} commodity for France with Pacific <b>oysters,</b> <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> and the great scallop being the three main species. Pacific oyster larvae production is currently successful, however larval production of <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> and scallops regularly face problems remedied by antibiotics. Using a bioassay technique, four potential probiotic strains (Alteromonas macleodii 0444, Neptunomonas sp. 0536, Phaeobacter gallaeciensis, Pseudoaltermonas sp. D 41) were tested upon the larvae of the three mollusc species when challenged with pathogens. Pacific <b>oysters</b> and <b>flat</b> <b>oysters</b> were challenged individually with the pathogens Vibrio coralliilyticus and V. pectenicida, while scallops were challenged with V. coralliilyticus and V. splendidus. Survival of the larvae was measured in challenged larvae given the probiotics and those without probiotic. In scallop larvae, protection against V. coralliilyticus and V. splendidus was provided by prior administration of P. gallaeciensis (29 % and 53 % better than the respective pathogen controls), A. macleodii 0444 (30 %, 36 %) and Neptunomonas sp. 0536 (36 %, 55 %). Significant protection with Pseudoalteromonas sp. D 41 was only provided against V. splendidus (35 %). In <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> larvae, protection against V. coralliilyticus and V. pectenicida was provided by P. gallaeciensis. (73 %, 69 %) and A. macleodii 0444 (45 %, 53 %). Neptunomonas sp. 0536 provided significant protection only against V. pectenicida (48 % higher). Use of Pseudoalteromonas sp. D 41 did not offer significant protection for <b>flat</b> <b>oyster</b> larvae against either pathogen. Experiments with Pacific oysters suggested that Pseudoalteromonas sp. D 41 and P. gallaeciensis could be effective against challenge by V. coralliilyticus (50 % and 40 % improved survival respectively) but not against V. pectenicida. The results indicate that P. gallaeciensis, A. macleodii 0444, Neptunomonas sp. 0536 and Pseudoalteromonas sp. D 41 could be useful in mollusc larviculture...|$|R
