40|$|Abstract. We present {{here the}} results of a {{numerical}} study performed to investigate the role of gravity waves {{in the evolution of the}} solar rotation profile. We show that, together with meridional circulation and shear turbulence, they may enforce solid body rotation in the solar interior. The transient phase is characterized by an outer portion of the radiative zone rotating at the velocity of the convection zone and <b>an</b> <b>inner</b> <b>portion</b> in strong differential rotation with depth. The gravity waves slow down the outer portion, whereas it is the meridional circulation which dominates the transport of momentum in the interior. With our treatment of the excitation and damping of these waves, solid body rotation is achieved on a timescale of a few giga-years, depending on the initial velocity of the model.
