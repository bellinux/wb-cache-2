The producer insisted that despite the abundance of pop music on the charts at that time, they did not pay much attention to what was being played on Top 40 radio. Instead, they focused on their own music and the [...] "bubble of creativity" [...] they were living in. Orbit also revealed, [...] "We liked what we're <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> current time and space," [...] he continued. [...] "What we tended to do was watch old French films from the '60s or listen to music that was so far away that it wasn't, in any way, relevant." ...|$|E

[...] Ed Liu of Toon Zone feels it is [...] "truly puzzling what Perry the secret agent is <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> show in the first place." [...] Liu considers his subplot to be a type of [...] "throw everything against the wall and see what sticks" [...] element and writes that [...] "many of the earlier episodes of the show don't manage to do a very good job of balancing the subplot and the main one." ...|$|E

Priya Elan from NME said the song [...] "seems to soar effortlessly" [...] and that [...] "what Madonna's <b>doing</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> song {{is so much}} more impossibly fun than we could have imagined." [...] She also stated the song was a progress from the sound of her previous album, Hard Candy. Jim Farber from the New York Daily News considered that the song is [...] "a pure snap of bubble gum, closer to an early single like 'Burning Up' than any of her more recent club hits. Only the rap cameos from the quite camp Nicki Minaj, and the less so M.I.A., tell us what decade we're in." [...] Michael Cragg from The Guardian felt that the track was not bad. [...] "Musically it's a pretty joyful four minutes, featuring bouncing beats, acoustic riffs and Gwen Stefani-style cheerleader chants, but there's something a bit flat about Madonna's delivery. Given all the love she's demanding, you'd think she'd be more excited." [...] Speaking of the rap part, he thought that [...] "Minaj certainly does her best, her typically frantic rap an exercise in squeezing as many words into a 10-second space as possible, while MIA's more laconic drawl loses momentum." [...] Chris Willman of Reuters called it [...] "risible" [...] and infectious: [...] "Everything here is as dumb as the titular spelling, but the campiness has its charm, at least if you like the old musicals that some of the tracking shots here are paying homage to". MTV News journalist Bradley Stern wrote about the [...] "Hey Mickey" [...] comparisons, complimenting the guest rapping of Minaj and M.I.A. even though he felt it was [...] "one of the album’s least compelling moments". In a review of MDNA, Neil McCormick of The Daily Telegraph felt that the prime purpose of the [...] "lightest, frothiest track" [...] from the album was to represent next generation's female pop stars. Emily Mackay of The Quietus wrote in detail about the song: ...|$|E
