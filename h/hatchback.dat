They all shared the same five-door <b>hatchback</b> body style and turbocharged engine, but offered differing levels of options and standard equipment.

5|$|The Citroën AX was {{launched}} without a twin in 1986, {{and the only}} other Talbot in development, the Arizona family <b>hatchback,</b> {{was launched}} instead as the Peugeot 309 {{at the end of}} 1985. Production of the Samba ended in May 1986, by which time 270,555 had been made, signalling {{the beginning of the end}} of the Talbot brand for passenger cars, the death knell finally sounding the following year when the last Horizon rolled off the production line in Finland, although the brand survived on commercial vehicles until 1994.|$|E
5|$|The Talbot Samba {{is a city}} car {{manufactured}} by the PSA Group in the former Simca factory in Poissy, France, and marketed under the short-lived modern-day Talbot brand from 1981 to 1986. Based on the Peugeot 104, {{it was the only}} Talbot not inherited from Chrysler Europe, engineered by PSA alone. It was also the last new Talbot to be launched, and the last in production. Its demise in 1986 was effectively the end of the Talbot brand for passenger cars. Launched initially as a three-door <b>hatchback,</b> it was also for some time the only small car available in a factory-ordered cabrio body style, and the most economical car in Europe.|$|E

5|$|In {{an effort}} to make the vehicle stand out in the market against similar rivals, which {{included}} its own derivatives, Peugeot added a more glamorous two-door cabriolet to the standard three-door <b>hatchback.</b> Although announced at the hatchback's launch, the first models were not available until 1982. Designed and built by the Italian coachbuilder Pininfarina, who had been building open-top Peugeots since the 1960s, it came only with the 1360cc engine; two engine versions were offered, 53 or 59kilowatts (72 or 80PS)—the former was dropped after 1984, at which time a slightly revised cabriolet was released featuring the later style 104 dashboard, twin carburettors and a lined hood; the 80bhp engine was shared with the Rallye. At the time of its launch it was the only cabrio small car available from the manufacturer, although other models subsequently entered the market segment created by the Samba, including PSA's own Citroën Visa Decapotable. Pininfarina built 13,062Samba cabriolets.|$|E
5|$|In late 2010 {{and early}} 2011, Lexus began {{sales of the}} CT 200h, a compact four-door hybrid <b>hatchback</b> {{designed}} for Europe, in multiple markets. Sales of lower-displacement regional models were also expanded, beginning with the ES 240 in China followed by the RX 270; Japan, Russia, and Taiwan were among markets which received model variants intended for reduced emissions or import taxes. In March 2011, the Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami caused severe disruption to Lexus' Japan-based production lines, hindering the marque's near-term sales prospects. Lexus' U.S. executives stated that due to vehicle shortages amidst close competition from BMW, Mercedes-Benz, and Audi, the marque would not remain the country's top-selling premium car brand.|$|E
5|$|The 1980s were {{challenging}} for Holden and the Australian automotive industry. The Australian Government tried {{to revive the}} industry with the Button car plan, which encouraged car makers to focus on producing fewer models at higher, more economical volumes, and to export cars. The decade opened with the shut-down of the Pagewood, New South Wales production plant and introduction of the light commercial Rodeo, sourced from Isuzu in Japan. The Rodeo was available in both two- and four-wheel drive chassis cab models {{with a choice of}} petrol and diesel powerplants. The range was updated in 1988 with the TF series, based on the Isuzu TF. Other cars sourced from Isuzu during the 1980s were the four-wheel drive Jackaroo (1981), the Shuttle (1982) van and the Piazza (1986) three-door sports <b>hatchback.</b> The second generation Holden Gemini from 1985 was also based on an Isuzu design, although, its manufacture was undertaken in Australia.|$|E
