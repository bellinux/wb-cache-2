5|$|Pym and Peters {{hide in the}} {{mountains}} surrounding {{the site of the}} ambush. They discover a labyrinth of passages in the hills with strange marks on the walls, and <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> whether these are the result of artificial or natural causes. Facing a shortage of food, they make a desperate run and steal a pirogue from the natives, narrowly escaping from the island and taking one of its inhabitants prisoner.|$|E
5|$|A key {{question}} surrounding the FairTax {{is whether the}} tax {{has the ability to}} be revenue-neutral; that is, whether the tax would result in an increase or reduction in overall federal tax revenues. Economists, advisory groups, and political advocacy groups <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> the tax rate required for the FairTax to be truly revenue-neutral. Various analysts use different assumptions, time-frames, and methods resulting in dramatically different tax rates making direct comparison among the studies difficult. The choice between static or dynamic scoring further complicates any estimate of revenue-neutral rates.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Supreme Court's {{desire to}} resolve {{conflicts}} between circuit courts, legal scholars <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> whether circuit splits are detrimental or beneficial. Some argue that circuit splits are harmful because they create confusion and encourage forum shopping, while other {{scholars argue that}} variation among circuits allows local courts to experiment with new laws that reflect the values of local residents. Scholars have also observed that regional variations in {{different areas of the}} United States have provided certain circuits with a particular specialization or expertise in some subjects of the law.|$|E
5|$|In {{defense of}} the text's authenticity, Ariel Shisha-Halevy, Professor of Linguistics at the Hebrew University of Jerusalem and a leading expert on Coptic language, {{concluded}} that the language itself offered no evidence of forgery. King also found examples from a new discovery in Egypt that has {{the same kind of}} grammar, showing that at least one unusual case is not unique. While some experts continue to <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> the other case, King notes that newly discovered texts often feature grammatical or spelling oddities which expand our understanding of the Coptic language.|$|E
5|$|Slavery issues {{dominated}} Breckinridge's political career, although historians <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> Breckinridge's views. In Breckinridge: Statesman, Soldier, Symbol, William C. Davis argues that, by adulthood, Breckinridge regarded slavery as evil; his {{entry in}} the 2002 Encyclopedia of World Biography records that he advocated voluntary emancipation. In Proud Kentuckian: John C. Breckinridge 1821–1875, Frank Heck disagrees, citing Breckinridge's consistent advocacy for slavery protections, beginning with his opposition to emancipationist candidates—including his uncle, Robert Jefferson Breckinridge—in the state elections of 1849.|$|E

5|$|The {{classification}} of birds is a contentious issue. Sibley and Ahlquist's Phylogeny and Classification of Birds (1990) is a landmark {{work on the}} {{classification of}} birds, although it is frequently debated and constantly revised. Most evidence seems to suggest the assignment of orders is accurate, but scientists <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> {{the relationships between the}} orders themselves; evidence from modern bird anatomy, fossils and DNA have all been brought to bear on the problem, but no strong consensus has emerged. More recently, new fossil and molecular evidence is providing an increasingly clear picture of the evolution of modern bird orders.|$|E
5|$|A luxurious ball {{followed}} the wedding on 20 May. Louis Stanislas found his wife repulsive; she was considered ugly, tedious, and {{ignorant of the}} customs of the court of Versailles. The marriage remained unconsummated for years. Biographers <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> the reason. The most common theories propose Louis Stanislas' alleged impotence (according to biographer Antonia Fraser) or his unwillingness to sleep with his wife due to her poor personal hygiene. She never brushed her teeth, plucked her eyebrows, or used any perfumes. At {{the time of his}} marriage, Louis Stanislas was obese and waddled instead of walked. He never exercised and continued to eat enormous amounts of food.|$|E
5|$|Ambassador Soval is summoned before Administrator V'Las and the High Council to face {{punishment}} {{over his}} use of a mind meld. Since the act is widely considered to be criminal by the Vulcan authorities, Soval is summarily dismissed from the Ambassadorial service. Meanwhile, Captain Archer and Commander T'Pol are questioned by the Syrrannites. After a short while, T'Pol is taken to see her mother, T'Les, and the two <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> the tenets of the group — the Vulcan authorities call them extremists, a term T'Les disagrees with. Soon, Archer begins to see visions of an old Vulcan, and the dissidents determine {{that he had the}} katra of Surak transferred into him via mind meld.|$|E

5000|$|The writers <b>disagreed</b> <b>about</b> authorship. In his 1962 autobiography, Upton Sinclair wrote: [...] "Mary Craig {{had written}} some tales of her Southern girlhood; and I had stolen them from {{her for a}} novel to be called Sylvia." ...|$|R
5|$|Temples and cults in Egypt itself {{declined}} as the Roman economy deteriorated in {{the third}} century AD, and beginning in the fourth century, Christians suppressed the veneration of Egyptian deities. The last formal cults, at Philae, died out in the fifth or sixth century. Most beliefs surrounding the gods themselves disappeared within a few hundred years, remaining in magical texts into the seventh and eighth centuries. But many of the practices involved in their worship, such as processions and oracles, were adapted to fit Christian ideology and persisted {{as part of the}} Coptic Church. Given the great changes and diverse influences in Egyptian culture since that time, scholars <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> whether any modern Coptic practices are descended from those of pharaonic religion. But many festivals and other traditions of modern Egyptians, both Christian and Muslim, resemble the worship of their ancestors' gods.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} suggested {{evidence of}} Columbian mammoth butchering in America (from Lovewell, Kansas) dates from 18,000 to 21,000 years ago. Paleoamericans of the Clovis culture, which arose roughly 7,000 years later, {{may have been}} the first humans to hunt mammoths extensively. These people are thought to have hunted Columbian mammoths with Clovis pointed spears which were thrown or thrust. Although Clovis points have been found with Columbian mammoth remains at several sites, archaeologists <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> whether the finds represent hunting, scavenging dead mammoths, or are coincidental. A female mammoth at the Naco-Mammoth Kill Site in Arizona, found with eight Clovis points near its skull, shoulder blade, ribs and other bones, is considered the most convincing evidence for hunting. In modern experiments, replica spears have been able to penetrate the rib cages of African elephants with re-use causing little damage to the points.|$|E
5|$|According to William of Malmesbury, Æthelstan {{was thirty}} {{years old when he}} came to the throne in 924, which would mean that he was born in about 894. He was the oldest son of Edward the Elder and also the tallest. He was Edward's only son by his first consort, Ecgwynn. Very little is known about Ecgwynn, and she is not named in any pre-Conquest source. Medieval chroniclers gave varying {{descriptions}} of her rank: one described her as an ignoble consort of inferior birth, while others described her birth as noble. Modern historians also <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> her status. Simon Keynes and Richard Abels believe that leading figures in Wessex were unwilling to accept Æthelstan as king in 924 partly because his mother had been Edward the Elder's concubine. However, Barbara Yorke and Sarah Foot argue that allegations that Æthelstan was illegitimate were a product of the dispute over the succession, and that there is no reason to doubt that she was Edward's legitimate wife. She may have been related to St Dunstan.|$|E

5|$|But suddenly, {{at the end}} of AD 31, he was arrested, summarily {{executed}} and {{his body}} unceremoniously cast down the Gemonian stairs. What caused his downfall is unclear: ancient historians <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> the nature of his conspiracy, whether it was Tiberius or Sejanus who struck first and in which order subsequent events occurred. Modern historians consider it unlikely that Sejanus plotted to seize power and if he had planned so at all, rather might have aimed at overthrowing Tiberius to serve as a regent to Tiberius Gemellus, son of Drusus or possibly Gaius Caligula. Unfortunately the relevant section pertaining to this period in the Annals of Tacitus has been lost. According to Josephus, it was Antonia, the mother of Livilla, who finally alerted Tiberius to the growing threat Sejanus posed (possibly with information provided by Satrius Secundus), in a letter she dispatched to Capri in the care of her freedman Pallas. According to Juvenal, a letter was sent from Capri with the orders to execute Sejanus without a trial.|$|E
5|$|Experts <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> {{the number}} of species in the genus Attalea (broadly defined). In 1965, Dutch {{taxonomist}} Jan Gerard Wessels Boer estimated that there may be as many as 100 species in the genus. In their 1996 Field Guide to the Palms of the Americas Andrew Henderson and coauthors recognised 29 species in the genus, while Sidney Glassman recognised 65 species in his 1999 treatment of the group. Largely following Glassman's lead, Rafaël Govaerts and John Dransfield recognised 67 species in their 2005 World Checklist of Palms. An important element of this disagreement is the decision by Glassman to define species more narrowly than Henderson. As a result, what Henderson interpreted as variation within species, Glassman took as differences between morphologically similar species. This problem is {{complicated by the fact that}} many of these species are poorly represented in herbarium collections. The large size of the leaves, inflorescences and fruit of many Attalea species makes them difficult to collect. In addition, many important collections, including type specimen, have been lost or destroyed. Sparse or incomplete collections make it difficult to differentiate variation within a single species from variation between different species.|$|E
5|$|Historians <b>disagree</b> <b>about</b> who {{initiated}} {{the idea of}} organizing a national assembly. Some credit Jonas Basanavičius, while others argue for Jonas Kriaučiūnas. The organizational activities were largely taken on by the Lithuanian Christian Democrats and by Vilniaus žinios, a moderate newspaper owned by Petras Vileišis. Vilniaus žinios was the first legal Lithuanian-language daily newspaper to appear after the Lithuanian press ban was lifted on May 7, 1904; it was quite popular and its circulation soon reached 6,000 copies. On October 31 (October 18 O.S.), 1905 a fifteen-member organizational committee, chairman Jonas Basanavičius and secretary Jonas Kriaučiūnas, was given the task of convening the assembly. They published an appeal or a manifest to the Lithuanian people on November 11 (October 29 O.S.) in Vilniaus žinios. The appeal, signed by the chairman and the secretary, aroused much interest in the public. Invitations were extended to all persons who would be elected as representatives by their communities at volosts, and to all other educated people interested {{in the future of}} the Lithuanian state. At the end of the appeal there was an eight-point agenda to be discussed at the Seimas. It did not include the question of Lithuanian autonomy.|$|E
50|$|The {{relationship}} between both ministers {{was not too}} good, {{because they had a}} completely different style of operating and <b>disagreed</b> <b>about</b> several issues.
