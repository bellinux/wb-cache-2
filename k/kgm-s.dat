40|$|The {{cultivation}} of sweet sorghum [Sorghum bicolor (L.) Moench] {{is considered a}} proposed energy crops {{in order to be}} used in the production of bio - ethanol in Mediterranean ecosystems. Water consists a resource in shortage in these ecosystems and its use must be organized according to cultivation needs. Sweet sorghum crops in western Greece during summer frequently undergoes water deprivation therefore, field studies have been conducted in the University of Patras farm during the agricultural periods 2003 - 2004 & 2004 - 2005 aiming the study of the influence of two manipulation of soil fertility and levels of irrigation as well as a Sevier of parameters such as: The crops yields in biomass, sugar and growth rates « Crop Growth Rate », CGR and « Leaf Area Index », LAI. Furthermore the influence of two manipulation of soil fertility on the photosynthetic activity of plant leaves has been studied. The needs of the crop in water have been calculation of evapotranspiration according to Penman-Monteith (FAO model) and the proposed model by researchers Derca and Liakata in the soil climatic conditions of Patras University (Rion). Simultaneously the data have been compared to measurements of transpiration with the Sap Flow method. The factor - soil fertility manipulation - was determined as «conventional» and «biological» manipulation while for every combination three repetitions were made.

The study was based on two years primary data collected in 2012 and 2013 and the questionnaire was used as a research tool for collection of data required for the study. The effective rain fall was estimated through CROPWAT (computer based programme) using the meteorological data obtained from WAPDA (Water and Power development authority), where the discharges of tubewells were determined by volumetric method. The number of irrigations, time taken by each turn and crop yield was recorded {{with the help of a}} questionnaire.

Also, the effect of four nitrogen levels (0 kgha- 1, 150 kgha- 1, 200 kgha- 1 and 250 kgha- 1) was compared with each treatment. The seasonal evapotranspiration in the treatments varied from 233 mm to 328 mm during the spring period and from 276 mm to 344 mm during the autumn period. The highest broccoli yield was obtained in the spring period as 11. 02 tha- 1 and in the autumn period as 4. 55 tha- 1. In general, there were statistical differences along nitrogen does with respect to yield and yield components while there were {{no statistically significant differences}} in the yield and yield components among irrigation regimes.

40|$|The correct {{analysis}} of amorphous silica concentration (CASi) in natural waters is crucial if {{one wants to}} correctly quantify terrestrial and/or riverine ASi fluxes. Soil ASi measurements are conducted with a constant solid to solution ratio (). As the suspended particulate matter concentration (CSPM), and therefore, cannot be exactly known a priori in river samples. It {{is important to understand}} how variations in effect analysed CASi. The objectives of this paper are (i) to investigate whether and how variations in values affect measured CASi in river runoff samples and (ii) to investigate {{whether or not it is}} possible to define a range of within which CASi in runoff and/or soil samples can be accurately measured. For the laboratory experiment 30 runoff samples with a wide range of CSPM, typical for the Belgian Loam Belt, were prepared and analysed using the alkaline digestion method (0. 1 M Na 2 CO 3). Our study confirmed that the alkaline digestion method proposed by DeMaster can be used for runoff samples provided that is within certain limits: at very low ( 0. 8 <b>kgm-</b> 3) incomplete dissolution of ASi as well as the reduction of mineral dissolution rates results in underestimated CASi. As both errors compensate one another, the range of applicable -values can be extended above the theoretically correct limit (1. 6 <b>kgm-</b> 3). The finding that reliable measurements can be made within a relatively wide range of values (0. 1 ≤≤ 1. 6 <b>kgm-</b> 3) is important. It is now possible to propose a method for the measurement of ASi in runoff samples. We make recommendations for ASi analysis distinguishing samples with a low and high CSPM. For samples with a low CSPM (≤ 1. 6 <b>kgm-</b> 3) the standard procedure is proposed while for samples with a high CSPM (> 1. 6 <b>kgm-</b> 3) an adapted procedure is proposed, analogue to that for soil samples. However, one should be aware that the range and limits for proposed here may depend on the type of sediment to be analysed: it is therefore recommended to evaluate the performance of the method again before it is used in other environments. © 2011...|$|R

Methods: Prospective birth cohort study. From 2006 to 2011, 2779 pregnant women (2807 children) {{were enrolled in the}} Environments for Healthy Living: Griffith birth cohort study in South-East Queensland, Australia. Hospital delivery record and self-report baseline survey of maternal, household and demographic factors during pregnancy were linked to the Queensland Hospital Admitted Patients Data Collection from 1 November 2006 to 30 June 2012, for child admissions. Maternal pregravid BMI was classified as underweight (< 18. 5 ?<b>kg?m-</b> 2), normal weight (18. 5 - 24. 9 ?<b>kg?m-</b> 2), overweight (25. 0 - 29. 9 ?<b>kg?m-</b> 2) or obese (30 ?<b>kg?m-</b> 2). Main outcomes were the total number of child hospital admissions and ICD- 10 -AM diagnostic groupings in the first 5 years of life. Negative binomial regression models were calculated, adjusting for follow-up duration, demographic and health factors. The cohort comprised 8397. 9 person years (PYs) follow-up. Results: Children of mothers who were classified as obese had an increased risk of all-cause hospital admissions in the first 5 years of life than the children of mothers with a normal BMI (adjusted rate ratio (RR) = 1. 48, 95 % confidence interval 1. 10 - 1. 98). Conditions of the nervous system, infections, metabolic conditions, perinatal conditions, injuries and respiratory conditions were excessive, in both absolute and relative terms, for children of obese mothers, with RRs ranging from 1. 3 - 4. 0 (PYs adjusted). Children of mothers who were underweight were 1. 8 times more likely to sustain an injury or poisoning than children of normal-weight mothers (PYs adjusted). Conclusion: Results suggest that if the intergenerational impact of maternal obesity (and similarly issues related to underweight) could be addressed, a significant reduction in child health care use, costs and public health burden would be likely.

40|$|Rapid {{urbanization}} and industrialization {{have increased}} the pressure on limited existing fresh water to meet the growing needs for food production. Two immediate responses to this challenge are the efficient use of irrigation technology {{and the use of}} alternative sources of water. Drip irrigation methods may {{play an important role in}} efficient use of water but there is still limited information on their use on sugar beet crops in arid countries such as Iran. An experiment was conducted to evaluate the effects of irrigation method and water quality on sugar beet yield, percentage of sugar content and irrigation water use efficiency (IWUE). The irrigation methods investigated were subsurface drip, surface drip and furrow irrigation. The two waters used were treated municipal effluent (EC= 1. 52 dSm- 1) and fresh water (EC= 0. 509 dSm- 1). The experiments used a split plot design and were undertaken over two consecutive growing seasons in Southern Iran. Statistical testing indicated that the irrigation method and water quality had a significant effect (at the 1 % level) on sugar beet root yield, sugar yield, and IWUE. The highest root yield (79. 7 Mgha- 1) was obtained using surface drip irrigation and effluent and the lowest root yield (41. 4 Mgha- 1) was obtained using furrow irrigation and fresh water. The highest IWUE in root yield production (9 <b>kgm-</b> 3) was obtained using surface drip irrigation with effluent and the lowest value (3. 8 <b>kgm-</b> 3) was obtained using furrow irrigation with fresh water. The highest IWUE of 1. 26 <b>kgm-</b> 3 for sugar was obtained using surface drip irrigation. The corresponding efficiency using effluent was 1. 14 <b>kgm-</b> 3. Irrigation with effluent led to an increase in the net sugar yield due to an increase in the sugar beet root yield. However, there was a slight reduction in the percentage sugar content in the plants. This study also showed that soil water and root depth monitoring can be used in irrigation scheduling to avoid water stress. Such monitoring techniques can also save considerable volumes of irrigation water and can increase yield.

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} fire intensities on physiochemical soil properties {{have been studied}} in this research. The experiment was conducted in a eucalyptus forested area near the Namadgi National Park (ACT, Australia), and four fire intensities were achieved by adding different amounts of fuel load: 0 <b>kgm-</b> 2 (control), 2 <b>kgm-</b> 2 (low fire intensity), 4 <b>kgm-</b> 2 (moderate fire intensity) and 8 <b>kgm-</b> 2 (high fire intensity). Soil surface peak temperatures reached at each plot were 14, 142, 317 and 525 °C, respectively. Immediate changes in soil properties under different fuel loads were studied and monitored monthly during a 7 -month period. Average pH increased significantly with fuel load immediately after fire and decreased progressively to initial values. Changes in soil pH from burnt plots seem to be caused mainly by an ephemeral ash layer, and the recovery time has been relatively short. The complete oxidation of soil organic matter {{and the release of}} substantial amounts of cations after high fire intensity also contributed to increased pH. Only small variations in soil texture have been observed in this study even after high intensity fire, although the clay content decreased slightly during the experiment. This can be due to relatively low pre-burn clay content, but also to spatial variability of texture. In this case, post-fire erosion processes might have contributed to decreased clay content and are probably more important than other processes associated to temperature. Aggregate stability indices showed good correlation coefficients with the organic matter content. The role of organic matter as cementing agent of soil aggregates is extremely important after fire, since aggregate stability indices showed good correlation coefficients with the organic matter content. Low intensity fire enhanced soil water repellency. In this case, fire-enhanced soil water repellency persisted or increased progressively, but decreased below initial levels {{at the end of the}} experiment, but soil water repellency was completely destroyed after moderate or high fuel load treatments. The persistence of wettable conditions after destruction of soil water repellency can be considered as an index of fire severity, since it is a direct consequence of strong reduction of organic matter content.

We report the results of a community survey of underweight, obesity and overweight in two suburban communities in northern Nigeria. Methods: We studied an adult population sample in suburban northern Nigeria. Obesity was defined as BMI> 30 <b>KgM-</b> 2 while overweight was defined as BMI> 25. 0 but < 30. 0; and underweight was defined as BMI < 18. 5 <b>KgM-</b> 2. Results: 317 subjects participated in the study, 267 (84. 23 %) were males and 50 (15. 77 %) females. Forty-one (13. 1 %) of the subjects had obesity, overweight occurred in 58 (18. 5 %) while underweight occurred in 21 (6. 7 %) subjects. Conclusion: Both over-nutrition and under-nutrition are common in these communities with the former being more prevalent. Concerted efforts should be made to appropriately control the prevalence of overweight and obesity. (Int J Diabetes Metab 15 : 68 - 69, 2007...|$|R

40|$|Climate warming at high {{northern}} latitudes {{has caused}} substantial increases in plant productivity of tundra vegetation and {{an expansion of the}} range of deciduous shrub species. However significant the increase in carbon (C) contained within above-ground shrub biomass, it is modest in comparison with the amount of C stored in the soil in tundra ecosystems. Here, we use a ‘space-for-time' approach to test the hypothesis that a shift from lower-productivity tundra heath to higher-productivity deciduous shrub vegetation in the sub-Arctic may lead to a loss of soil C that out-weighs the increase in above-ground shrub biomass. We further hypothesize that a shift from ericoid to ectomycorrhizal systems coincident with this vegetation change provides a mechanism for the loss of soil C. We sampled soil C stocks, soil surface CO 2 flux rates and fungal growth rates along replicated natural transitions from birch forest (Betula pubescens), through deciduous shrub tundra (Betula nana) to tundra heaths (Empetrum nigrum) near Abisko, Swedish Lapland. We demonstrate that organic horizon soil organic C (SOCorg) is significantly lower at shrub (2. 98 ± 0. 48 <b>kgm-</b> 2) and forest (2. 04 ± 0. 25 <b>kgm-</b> 2) plots than at heath plots (7. 03 ± 0. 79 <b>kgm-</b> 2). Shrub vegetation had the highest respiration rates, suggesting that despite higher rates of C assimilation, C turnover was also very high and less C is sequestered in the ecosystem. Growth rates of fungal hyphae increased across the transition from heath to shrub, suggesting that the action of ectomycorrhizal symbionts in the scavenging of organically bound nutrients is an important pathway by which soil C is made available to microbial degradation. The expansion of deciduous shrubs onto potentially vulnerable arctic soils with large stores of C could therefore represent a significant positive feedback to the climate system...|$|R

40|$|Planar Solid Oxid Fuel Cells (SOFC) show {{interesting}} {{advantages in}} their characteristics {{compared to other}} fuel cells and heat engines because of their high efficiency. Chromiumbased steels and chromium contending compounds are used as interconnect material for a temperature range between 600 °C and 900 °C. These materials cause degradation of cells in SOFC because of their volatile Cr-species. The amount of evaporated chromium depends on temperature and humidity. In this work the connection is shown {{over a wide range}} of water partial pressure. There are two possibilities to reduce Cr evaporation. On one hand lowering the temperature will lowering the Cr evaporation rate. On the other hand Cr evaporation can be lowered by protective coatings. In this work the temperature and coating material dependence of Cr evaporation is measured. For high temperatures of about 900 °C the Ducrolloy material is used. For temperatures of 800 °C the Crofer 22 APU, CroferH, IT 11 and F 17 TNB are tested with different coatings. For temperatures of 600 °C ferritic steel and also austenitic steel such as 1. 4845 is tested. Coating material of Mn 3 O 4 and MnCo 1. 9 Fe 0. 1 O 4 as protective material and LCC 10 and LCC 13 as contact layer are selected.

Little however is known on sediment/soil capacity to store organic carbon {{and the impact of}} benthic fauna on soil organic carbon (SOC) stock in mangrove C-poor soils. This study aimed to investigate the effects of macrobenthos on SOC storage and dynamic in mangrove forest at Gazi Bay (Kenya). Although the relatively low amount of organic carbon (OC%) in these soils, they resulted in the presence of large ecosystem carbon stock comparable to other forest ecosystems. SOC at Gazi bay ranged from 3. 6 <b>kgm-</b> 2 in a Desert-like belt to 29. 7 <b>kgm-</b> 2 in the Rhizophora belt considering the depth soil interval from 0 cm to 80 cm. The high spatial heterogeneity in the distribution and amount of SOC seemed to be explained by different dominant crab species and their impact on the soil environment. A further major determinant was the presence, in the subsoil, of horizons rich in organic matter, whose dating pointed to their formation being associated with sea level rise over the Holocene. Dating and soil morphological characters proved to be an effective support to discuss links between the strategies developed by macrobenthos and soil ecosystem functioning. © 2013 Elsevier B. V.
