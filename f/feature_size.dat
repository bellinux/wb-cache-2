30|$|<b>Feature</b> <b>sizes</b> are {{selected}} {{in the range from}} 500 to 3000 with 500 increments, compared with the total <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> ranging from 8000 to 18, 000 for the Turkish review datasets and from 8000 to 38, 000 for English review datasets. In our previous study [10], we observed that <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> up to 3000 tend to give good classification performance improvement; therefore we choose these <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> in our experiments.|$|R
30|$|The {{stability}} of OrmoStamp®; working stamps {{together with their}} uniformity over large areas, enables transfer printing of various structures with challenging aspect ratios and <b>feature</b> <b>sizes.</b> To further demonstrate and investigate the usefulness of this approach, we reduced the <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> to the sub-micrometer regime.|$|R
40|$|Reduced <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> {{offer the}} {{possibility}} to build more powerful computer architectures. Unfortunately the rapid developments in VLSI technology which allow those improvements introduce another problem. As wire delays do not scale with smaller <b>feature</b> <b>sizes,</b> communication will become a major bottleneck in future processors. Current computer architectures are not suited to handle this problem...|$|R
25|$|As the <b>feature</b> <b>size</b> of {{flash memory}} cells reaches the 15-16 nm minimum limit, further flash density {{increases}} will {{be driven by}} TLC (3bits/cell) combined with vertical stacking of NAND memory planes. The decrease in endurance and increase in uncorrectable bit error rates that accompany <b>feature</b> <b>size</b> shrinking can be compensated by improved error correction mechanisms. Even with these advances, it may be impossible to economically scale flash to smaller and smaller dimensions {{as the number of}} electron holding capacity reduces. Many promising new technologies (such as FeRAM, MRAM, PMC, PCM, ReRAM, and others) are under investigation and development as possible more scalable replacements for flash.|$|E
2500|$|Several other {{companies}} were second-source manufacturers of the HMOS 68000. [...] These included Hitachi (HD68000), who shrank the <b>feature</b> <b>size</b> to 2.7µm for their 12.5MHz version, Mostek (MK68000), Rockwell (R68000), Signetics (SCN68000), Thomson/SGS-Thomson (originally EF68000 and later TS68000), and Toshiba (TMP68000). Toshiba {{was also a}} second-source maker of the CMOS 68HC000 (TMP68HC000).|$|E
2500|$|The ASIC {{physical}} {{design flow}} uses the technology libraries that {{are provided by}} the fabrication houses. Technologies are commonly classified according to minimal <b>feature</b> <b>size.</b> Standard sizes, {{in the order of}} miniaturization, are 2μm, 1μm , 0.5μm , 0.35μm, 0.25μm, 180nm, 130nm, 90nm, 65nm, 45nm, 28nm, 22nm, 18nm, 14nm, etc. [...] They may be also classified according to major manufacturing approaches: n-Well process, twin-well process, SOI process, etc.|$|E

NanoRIM constitutes the first scalable manufacturing method for thermoset polymers that allows combining large (> cm) and small (< μm) lateral <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> with varying replica thickness {{in the same}} device.

The load and constraint position, the connection <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> directly affect the structural configuration of the part obtained by the topology optimization, and more importantly, the part performance [26]. Structural topology optimization and size optimization are used to optimize the performance of the connection structure and the main <b>feature</b> <b>sizes.</b>|$|R
40|$|Serial Analysis of Gene Expression (SAGE) is a {{relatively}} new method for monitoring gene expression levels and is expected to contribute significantly to the progress in cancer treatment by enabling a precise and early diagnosis. A promising application of SAGE gene expression data is classification of tumors. In this paper, we build three event models (the multivariate Bernoulli model, the multinomial model and the normalized multinomial model) for SAGE data classification. Both binary classification and multicategory classification are investigated. Experiments on two SAGE datasets show that the multivariate Bernoulli model performs well with small <b>feature</b> <b>sizes,</b> but the multinomial performs better at large <b>feature</b> <b>sizes,</b> while the normalized multinomial performs well with medium <b>feature</b> <b>sizes.</b> The multinomial achieves the highest overall accuracy...|$|R
2500|$|The {{original}} MC68000 was fabricated {{using an}} HMOS process with a 3.5µm <b>feature</b> <b>size.</b> Formally introduced in September 1979, Initial samples were released in February 1980, with production chips available {{over the counter}} in November. Initial speed grades were 4, 6, and 8MHz. 10MHz chips became available during 1981, and 12.5MHz chips by June 1982. The 16.67MHz [...] "12F" [...] version of the MC68000, the fastest version of the original HMOS chip, was not produced until the late 1980s.|$|E
2500|$|Over {{the past}} decades, the MOSFET has {{continually}} been scaled down in size; typical MOSFET channel lengths were once several micrometres, but modern integrated circuits are incorporating MOSFETs with channel lengths {{of tens of}} nanometers. Robert Dennard's work on scaling theory was pivotal in recognising that this ongoing reduction was possible. Intel began production of a process featuring a 32nm <b>feature</b> <b>size</b> (with the channel being even shorter) in late 2009. The semiconductor industry maintains a [...] "roadmap", the ITRS, [...] which sets the pace for MOSFET development. Historically, the difficulties with decreasing {{the size of the}} MOSFET have been associated with the semiconductor device fabrication process, the need to use very low voltages, and with poorer electrical performance necessitating circuit redesign and innovation (small MOSFETs exhibit higher leakage currents and lower output resistance).|$|E

50|$|In 1965 Gordon Moore {{observed}} that silicon transistors were undergoing a continual process of scaling downward, an observation which was later codified as Moore's law. Since his observation transistor minimum <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> have decreased from 10 micrometers to the 28-22 nm range in 2011. The field of nanoelectronics aims {{to enable the}} continued realization of this law by using new methods and materials to build electronic devices with <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> on the nanoscale.|$|R
40|$|One of the {{challenges}} of feature extraction in image processing {{is caused by the}} fact that objects originating from a feature class don't always appear in a unique <b>size,</b> and the <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> are diverse. Hence, a multiresolution analysis using wavelets should be suitable. Because of their integer scaling factors classical dyadic or M-channel wavelet filter banks often don't match very well the corresponding <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> occurring within the image. This paper presents a new method to optimally extract <b>features</b> in different <b>sizes</b> by designing a rational biorthogonal wavelet filter bank, which matches both the features' characteristics and the significant sizes of the most dominant features' sizes. This is achieved by matching the rational downsampling factor to the different <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> and matching the filter coefficients to the feature characteristics. The presented method is evaluated with the detection of defects on specular surfaces and of contaminations on manufactured metal surfaces...|$|R
40|$|A {{relatively}} simple technique is demonstrated to fabricate three-dimensional face-centered-cubic infrared photonic crystals with submicron <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> using GaAs-based technology, single-step epitaxial growth, and lateral wet oxidation. The photonic crystals were fabricated with <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> (a) of 1. 5 and 0. 5 μm. Transmission measurements reveal a stopband centered at 1. 0 μm {{with a maximum}} attenuation of 10 dB for the submicron (a = 0. 5  μm) (a= 0. 5 μm) photonic crystal.

The radius-edge ratio of most output tetrahedra are bounded by a constant, except possibly {{those that are}} provably close to small angles. Further, the mesh is graded, that is, edge lengths are at least a constant fraction of the local <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> at the edge endpoints. Unlike a previous algorithm, this algorithm is simple to implement as it avoids computing local <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> and protective zones explicitly. Our experimental results confirm our claims and show that few skinny tetrahedra remain...|$|R

40|$|The {{possibility}} of focusing light to an ever tighter spot {{has important implications}} for many applications and fields of optics research, such as nano-optics and plasmonics, laser-scanning microscopy, optical data storage and many more. The <b>size</b> of lateral <b>features</b> of the field at the focus depends on several parameters, including the numerical aperture of the focusing system, but also the wavelength and polarization, phase and intensity distribution of the input beam. Here, we study the smallest achievable focal <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> of coherent superpositions of two co-propagating beams carrying opposite orbital angular momentum. We investigate the <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> for this class of beams not only in the scalar limit, but also use a fully vectorial treatment to discuss the case of tight focusing. Both our numerical simulations and our experimental results confirm that lateral <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> considerably smaller than those of a tightly focused Gaussian light beam can be observed. These findings may pave the way for improving the resolution of imaging systems or may find applications in nano-optics experiments. Comment: 6 pages, 3 figure...|$|R

40|$|The {{fabrication}} of sub- 100 nm <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> in large-scale three-dimensional (3 D) geometries by two-photon polymerization requires a precise {{control of the}} polymeric reactions {{as well as of}} the intensity distribution of the ultrashort laser pulses. The authors, therefore, investigate the complex interplay of photoresist, processing parameters, and focusing optics. New types of inorganic- organic hybrid polymers are synthesized and characterized with respect to achievable structure sizes and their degree of crosslinking. For maintaining diffraction-limited focal conditions within the 3 D processing region, a special hybrid optics is developed, where spatial and chromatic aberrations are compensated by a diffractive optical element. <b>Feature</b> <b>sizes</b> below 100 nm are demonstrated...|$|R

For this study, regular nano line patterns with <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> between 100 and 1000 nm were produced on polymers polyimide, polyetheretherketone, and polydimethylsiloxane. Cell culture experiments with B 35 neuronal cells revealed the alignment of cellular extensions along nano grooves of different <b>feature</b> <b>sizes.</b> Especially, when <b>feature</b> depth exceeds a distinct threshold (aspect ratio > 0. 6), more than 50 % of cells are oriented parallel, i. e., within angles of 0 °- 30 ° to {{the direction of the}} line pattern.

30|$|Following {{a similar}} process, we also carried out {{experiments}} on English review datasets and NBM {{seems to be}} the most suitable classifier for sentiment analysis. For feature selection methods, CHI 2 and IG are strongly correlated and tend to work well with smaller <b>feature</b> <b>sizes,</b> while DFD also works reasonably well, but with bigger <b>feature</b> <b>sizes.</b> Our proposed query expansion ranking method achieves the best performances for the English datasets as well. As for differences, the English review datasets usually have a bigger vocabulary, resulting in relatively bigger <b>feature</b> <b>sizes</b> for <b>feature</b> selection. Moreover, LR and SVM also perform well for some English review datasets, while NBM looks like a dominant classifier for the Turkish reviews. The performance results for the English reviews are generally higher than those for the Turkish reviews, possibly related to {{the differences between the two}} languages in terms of vocabularies, writing styles, and the agglutinative property of the Turkish language. Finally, the experimental results show that our proposal QER method is language, domain and classifier independent and improve the classification performance better than other FS methods for sentiment analysis.|$|R
