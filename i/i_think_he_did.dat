500|$|One {{day when}} we were living at Kawaihae my {{grandmother}} went to Hulihee to see Kuakini, who was not well. I went with her and when Kinau saw me he chased me as he always did. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not like me. I ran to my grandmother and she protected me. Kuakini saw me and said to my grandmother to let the haole go and told us to [...] "hakaka" [...] (fight). She did and we fought. I beat him. Kuakini made fun of Kinau who was about six years old then.|$|E
2500|$|During an {{interview}} [...] Clarence 'Frogman' Henry, {{one of the}} most popular and respected jazz singers of New Orleans, said: [...] "Jolson? I loved him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> wonders for the blacks and glorified entertainment." ...|$|E
2500|$|One Texas Ranger {{said that}} {{although}} {{it was obvious to}} him that Lucas often lied, there was an instance where he demonstrated guilty knowledge: [...] "I remember him trying to cop to one he didn't do, but there was another murder case where I'll kiss your butt if he didn’t lead us right to the deer stand where the murder took place. Ain't no way he could've guessed that, and I damn sure didn't tell him. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> that one." [...] Another Ranger had a similar experience: Lucas demonstrated his apparent familiarity with a crime scene by directing his escort to the murder location with ease, {{as if he had been}} there before.|$|E
6000|$|... 'That {{would be}} delightful,' said Clem. 'Mr. Charles Tudor does come in {{sometimes}} at twelve o'clock, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it almost {{as well as}} Victoire.' ...|$|R
60|$|P.S.--You were {{perfectly}} right about your Uncle Donald's moustache, but I don't {{agree with you}} that it is more his misfortune than his fault. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it on purpose.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, impossible! But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{not tell}} many lies," [...] said Nuna apologetically. [...] "I <b>think</b> <b>he</b> only <b>does</b> it a little. Then {{he goes on}} his knees every night before lying down, and every morning when he rises, and speaks to himself." ...|$|R
2500|$|... {{more of a}} pop {{producer}} kind of guy. He's {{worked with}} Candlebox before and sold millions of albums with them, so working with us, {{we were kind of}} like his lab rats, you know? He's never really done a metal band before but overall <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a pretty fantastic job. He got a real live quality out of us because we were always used to doing drums first and then the bass, and then the guitar and then the vocals at the very end. This time we recorded most of the songs live with the whole band and then after one song was done, Warrel would immediately sing on it [...] of saving all of [...] to the very end, which kind of saves his voice in the overall recording process. I guess the whole album was done in a very different atmosphere and aspect that sounds really good.|$|E
2500|$|When {{speaking}} on the album's features in March 2013, Schoolboy Q told MTV, [...] "I just kept it real in house with my homies. This my first album; it's real special to me. I don't wanna be messing with this dude, with this dude, this dude. It's all in house, it's the same Q. Like the fans, I'mma give 'em what they want." [...] In March 2013, Schoolboy Q once again stated the album was four songs away from being completed. That month, Schoolboy Q revealed to Vibe {{that he decided to}} continue his [...] "Druggy's wit Hoes" [...] song series, for the album. He revealed it's one of the easier songs for him to do, as it comes natural: [...] "I go to the studio, get faded, said, 'Cuh Soul, I got Druggy Wit Hoes Part 3,' and he said, 'I'm on my way.' I think he was off acid that night too. Yeah, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> his verse off acid [...]" [...] In April 2013, he stated {{he had been in the}} studio with American record producers David Banner and Pharrell Williams.|$|E
2500|$|Duff McKagan {{praised the}} album, saying that [...] "Axl sounds amazing" [...] and [...] "I think Axl's finally made the record {{he always wanted}} to". Slash reacted {{positively}} to the title track, stating [...] "That sounds cool. It's good to hear Axl's voice again, y'know?" [...] When the album was released, Slash responded by saying [...] "It's a really good record. It's {{very different from what}} the original Guns N' Roses sounded like, but it's a great statement by Axl... It's a record that the original Guns N' Roses could never possibly make. And {{at the same time it}} just shows you how brilliant Axl is." [...] In a later interview, Slash stated the album was [...] "exactly what I thought it would sound like," [...] with many synthesizers and digital augmentations. Izzy Stradlin, soon after the album was released, said [...] "I have listened to some tracks off the record and I enjoyed them" [...] and [...] "I like what I've heard." [...] Steven Adler said he [...] "didn't like the album, not one bit." [...] Gilby Clarke stated [...] "I think it's a really good record – I honestly do. I think it's a great record... Knowing what I know what direction he wanted to take the band, I think he hit the nail on the head; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> a great job" [...] Matt Sorum called the album a 'toe-tapper'. Early Guns N' Roses guitarist Tracii Guns said he thought the album was [...] "over-indulgent, sterile and not that exciting." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Is he all as {{he should}} be?' asked Miss Cathy, seriously; 'or is he simple: not right? I've {{questioned}} him twice now, and each time he looked so stupid <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not understand me. I can hardly understand him, I'm sure!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes; {{that was}} Marley Bullock. He's abroad somewhere now with nothing a year paid {{quarterly}} to live on. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{a little at}} cards. He'd had {{a good bit of}} money once, but most of it was gone when he came my way." ...|$|R
50|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he's</b> <b>doing</b> {{a record}} with Bruce Springsteen. You know {{he always has}} to do one of those! My two records J.D. has {{produced}} for Nelly so far, he's gonna have some people on them—I won't tell it yet. I don't want to jinx the record.|$|R
2500|$|Rich's {{destructive}} personal behavior famously culminated at the CMA {{awards ceremony}} for 1975, when he presented {{the award for}} Entertainer of the Year, while visibly intoxicated. After stumbling through {{the names of the}} nominees, Rich clumsily tore open the envelope, took out a cigarette lighter, and lit the paper on fire with the winner's name. While the paper burned, he announced that the winner of the award was [...] "My friend Mr. John Denver." [...] Some considered it an act of rebellion against the Music Row-controlled Nashville Sound. But many speculated that Rich's behavior was a protest against the award going to Denver, whose music Rich had considered too [...] "pop" [...] and not enough [...] "country". Others, including industry insiders, were outraged, and Rich had trouble having hits throughout 1976, and only had one top-ten with [...] "Since I Fell For You". In a 2016 interview, former CMA Executive Director Jo Walker-Meador speculated that Rich's drunkenness may have been in part due to resentment over his being shut out of the nominations that year, after his success at the 1974 awards. His son Charlie, Jr., says on his website: [...] "...why did he do it? I'll tell you why I thought he did it. #1 He thought it would be funny. He set it up by talking about how the potential winners were probably nervous, as he had been the previous year. #2 Bad judgement. He had recently broken his foot in a freak accident at his home in Memphis. It sounds funny, but he got his foot caught in an awkward position while getting out of a reclining chair. He cracked several bones in his foot. So...Due to the pain, he took pain medication the night of the show: Bad idea! Secondly, he and another country star got to drinking gin and tonics while waiting in the dressing room. The show was long, so by the time Dad was supposed to go on, the drinks on top of the medication got him buzzed. So, there ya' go. That's why <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it. Primarily {{he thought it would be}} funny. I know the last thing my father would have wanted to do was set himself up as judge of another musician. He felt badly that people thought it was a statement against John Denver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, sir. But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b> He gave Ferris {{something}} and some money, and Ferris lost {{no time in}} getting to the printing establishment." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Nay, father, this <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not say; {{though it}} is quite probable; {{for the title of}} his aunt is an ancient barony, and those ancient baronies usually became the family name." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, ma'am, that warn't and ain't my opinion. The {{sergeant}} {{sent that}} telegram, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>done</b> wrong.

6000|$|... "I don't {{know how}} you managed him, but liking me has been for him a painful gradual process. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> now," [...] Nanda declared. [...] "He accepts me at last as different--he's trying with me on that basis. He has ended by {{understanding}} that when he talks to me of Granny I can't even imagine her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, I by {{no means}} intend that; but I would rather that you should not refer to his {{feelings}} toward me. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not quite understand the sort of life that I led while my husband was alive, and that he judged me amiss. Therefore I would have by-gones be by-gones." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Didn't he, mamma?" [...] And as {{she spoke}} a sad, weary, wobegone smile came over her face,--a smile so sad and piteous that it went to her mother's heart more keenly than would have done any sound of sorrow, any sobs, or wail of grief. [...] "But <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> mean that, mamma. It's no good doubting or fearing any longer. It's all over now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You make me curious; I {{went into}} detail {{because you are}} more {{interested}} than you want to show. Of course, I thought it strange {{that a man who}} spoke good English should relieve his feelings in German when he felt annoyed, and afterward try to convince me that he wasn't a foreigner. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> try and that was the reason he talked so much." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{knows there}} is {{extensive}} damage; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not {{open his eyes}} to the result, but he will bear it. Never was there a man to whom it came so naturally to live like the fowls of the air, or the lilies of the field, as it does to dear Dick May," [...] said Dr. Spencer, his voice faltering.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, he don't quite {{see through}} that. He {{said to me}} a few minutes ago, `Have these men no meat at home, that they come all this long way to get it?' I told him that you had plenty, and then endeavoured to explain your idea of hunting `for fun.' But he shook his head, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not believe you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Not I," [...] said Nick. [...] "I {{have been}} playing piquet with Lamarque {{most of the time}} since I arrived. He is one of the pleasantest men I have met in Louisiana, {{although}} a little taciturn, as you perceive, {{and more than a little}} deaf. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not like Auguste. He seems to have known him in his youth." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> for {{he liked}} to study, and wanted to get on, so he could help father. People used to call him a fine boy, and I felt so proud to hear it; {{but they did n't}} know half how wise he was, because he did n't show off a bit. I suppose sisters always are grand of their brothers; but I don't believe many girls had as much right to be as I had." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'My poor {{father was}} just gone, you know, and I {{could not be}} grieving her with what was passed and over, and letting her know {{that my father had}} broken my heart, as indeed <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> though he meant it all for the best. But oh! I thought it hard when Lucy had married the handsomest man in the country, and gone out to India, without a word against it, that I might not please myself, because I was papa's favourite.' ...|$|E
60|$|More {{and more}} he dwelt upon {{the time when}} she was young, and as the weeks went by his sorrow took on a wistful, vague longing for the past. Through the gate of memory he reëntered the world of his youth and walked once more with William and David and Luke. The mists which filled his eyes had nothing hot or {{withering}} in their touch--they comforted him. Whether he hoped to meet his love in some other world or not I do not know--but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|E

60|$|Such is Mannhardt's conclusion. Taken in {{connection}} with his still later essay on Demeter, it really leaves no room for doubt. There, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> 'throw out the child with the bath,' throw the knife after the handle.

6000|$|Whilst he {{was lying}} sick in this way, there came to the Court of Paflagonia a famous painter, whose name was Tomaso Lorenzo, and who was Painter in Ordinary to the King of Crim Tartary, Paflagonia's neighbour. Tomaso Lorenzo painted all the Court, who were delighted with his works; for even Countess Gruffanuff looked young and Glumboso good-humoured in his pictures. 'He flatters very much,' some people said. 'Nay!' says Princess Angelica, 'I am above flattery, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not make my picture {{handsome}} enough.
