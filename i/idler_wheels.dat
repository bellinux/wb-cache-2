The Mk VII design relied on an unusual steering method and a mechanical system [...] incorporated into earlier Vickers models. The front wheels could be steered to allow for gentle turns by bending the tracks. For sharper turns, the system returned to the conventional method of braking one track to turn the tank; the dual system of turning was designed to lessen mechanical strain on the MkVII and reduce its power wastage. The suspension system was also a new design that relied on struts with pockets of air for springing and cushions of oil for damping, and each of the wheels was independently sprung.|$|E

A larger or smaller <b>idler</b> <b>wheel</b> maintains the same surface speed (which equals the surface speed of the input shaft), therefore the output shaft is driven at a constant speed regardless of {{the size of}} the <b>idler</b> <b>wheel.</b>|$|R

50|$|The LK I was {{designed}} by Joseph Vollmer. It {{was based on a}} Daimler car chassis, using the existing axles to mount sprocket and <b>idler</b> <b>wheels.</b> Its design followed automobile practice, with a front-mounted engine and a driving compartment behind it. It was the first German armored fighting vehicle to be equipped with a turret, armed with a 7.92 mm MG08 machine gun.|$|E
50|$|The track {{assembly}} {{is made up}} of four wide rubberised-fabric band tracks reinforced with welded steel cross-pieces; four track guide engagement drive sprockets with nine pairs of polyurethane rollers; road wheels with rubber bands, and four <b>idler</b> <b>wheels</b> (one on either side is provided with a polyurethane rim). The suspension is independent, torsion-bar type, with spring supports on all rollers.|$|E
50|$|The {{running gear}} {{consists}} of 14 (2×7) rubber-rimmed double dished roadwheels, two <b>idler</b> <b>wheels</b> (at {{the front of}} the hull), two drive sprockets (rear hull) and ten (2×5) return rollers supporting two tracks. The tracks have a service life of approx. 2,500 km. The OF-40 rests on an independent torsion bar suspension system with hydraulic shock absorbers and friction dampers on the first, second, third, sixth and seventh pairs of roadwheels.|$|E

50|$|These {{theoretical}} {{vehicles are}} typically shown as having two parallel driven wheels, one mounted {{on each side}} of their centre, and (presumably) some sort of offset castor to maintain balance; although in general they could be any vehicle capable of simultaneous arbitrary rotation and translation. An alternative realization uses a single driven wheel with steering, and a pair of <b>idler</b> <b>wheels</b> to give balance and allow a steering torque to be applied.|$|E
50|$|The {{first major}} design change to tracked loaders {{came with the}} {{integration}} of hydraulic systems. Using hydraulics to power the loader linkages increased {{the power of the}} loader. More importantly, the loaders could apply downpressure to the bucket, vastly increasing their ability to dig unworked ground. Most of the tracked loaders were still based on a bulldozer equivalent. The weight of the engine was still on the front half of the tracks along with the heavy loader components. This caused many problems with heavy wear of the front <b>idler</b> <b>wheels</b> and the undercarriage in general. The Caterpillar 983 tracked loader, the second largest tracked loader ever built, was notorious for heavy undercarriage wear.|$|E
5000|$|The helical scan methods use a {{recording}} drum with a diagonal axis of rotation. The tape is wrapped longitudinally around the drum by <b>idler</b> <b>wheels,</b> so the tape heads, instead of {{moving across the}} tape at almost 90° to the direction of motion as in the quadruplex system, move across the tape at a shallow angle, recording a long diagonal track across the tape. This allows an entire frame to be recorded per track. This simplifies the electronics and timing systems. It also allows the recorder to be paused (freeze-framed) during playback to display a single still frame, by simply stopping the tape transport mechanism, allowing the tape heads to repeatedly pass over the same track.|$|E

50|$|The <b>Idler</b> <b>Wheel</b> Is Wiser Than the Driver of the Screw and Whipping Cords Will Serve You More Than Ropes Will Ever Do, {{frequently}} abridged as The <b>Idler</b> <b>Wheel...,</b> is {{the fourth}} studio album by Fiona Apple. Like her second album When the Pawn..., its title derives from a poem written by Apple herself. It was released on June 19, 2012, by Epic Records. The album debuted at number three on the Billboard 200, her highest debut yet, selling 72,000 copies in its first week. The album earned a nomination at the 2013 Grammy Awards for Best Alternative Album.|$|R
50|$|The new {{suspension}} {{was first}} tested {{on a third}} prototype, in September 1934 newly built from boiler plate; its <b>idler</b> <b>wheel</b> was still of the AMR 33 suspension type and its turret {{was that of the}} second prototype.|$|R
50|$|The {{experiences}} gained {{with the}} two prototypes {{were used for the}} main production T-35 Model 1935, which was again improved from the second prototype, with a longer chassis, improved hull and 45-mm guns in place of the 37s. It started production in 1935, and about 35 were built by 1938. In general, throughout its production run small improvements were made to the individual tanks. Production tanks had turrets similar to the ones on the BT-5, but without the rear overhang. Some examples had flamethrowers instead of one of the 45 mm guns. The final batch was a run of six T-35 Model 1938s, which had new turrets with sloped armour all around, as well as modified side skirts and new <b>idler</b> <b>wheels.</b>|$|E
50|$|The M1917 was a US tank {{accepted}} by the army in October 1918 and is primarily based on the plans of the French Renault FT. The crew, a driver and gunner, were separated from the engine by a bulkhead. Steel <b>idler</b> <b>wheels</b> replaced the wooden idlers fitted to French examples. Approximately 64 of the M1917 were built {{before the end of}} World War I and 10 were sent to Europe, but too late to be used in combat. After the war Van Dorn Iron Works, the Maxwell Motor Company, and the C.L. Best Tractor Company created 950 more. 374 had cannons and 526 had machine guns and 50 were signal (radio) tanks. A later modification, the M1917A1, was a lengthened, rebuilt, updated version compared to the French one, having a 100 hp Franklin engine and an electric self-starter rather than a crank starter.|$|E
50|$|Note {{that there}} are some non-powered tracked {{transports}} (i.e. trailers that roll on tracks rather than wheels), which have two <b>idler</b> <b>wheels</b> rather than a drive sprocket. There are also certain pieces of equipment, such as the Caterpillar D9 bulldozer, Tucker Sno-cat and Mattracks rubber track conversion kits, which configure their tracks {{in the shape of a}} triangle, or pyramid (when viewed from the side), with the drive sprocket at the tip of the pyramid. In this configuration, there are two idler/roadwheels and one drive sprocket (as well as a number of small, load-bearing roadwheels). In very rare cases, the vehicle lacks an idler wheel at all; in Northern regions, one way people got better traction in deep snow was to take a simple three-axle truck, and install a simple continuous track around the rear wheels, thus forming a basic half-track system which featured two drive wheels, and no idler or road wheels. One almost never sees this on true tracked vehicles, however, as the second drive wheel is redundant.|$|E
50|$|StuG III Ausf. C: (Sd.Kfz 142; April 1941, 50 produced) Gunner's forward {{view port}} above driver's visor was a shot trap and thus eliminated; instead, {{superstructure}} top {{was given an}} opening for gunner's periscope. <b>Idler</b> <b>wheel</b> was redesigned.|$|R
5000|$|... "Every Single Night" [...] {{is a song}} {{written and}} {{performed}} by American alternative singer-songwriter Fiona Apple. It was released on April 24, 2012 by Epic Records as the lead and only single from her fourth studio album The <b>Idler</b> <b>Wheel...</b> (2012).|$|R
50|$|The track ran on four double {{roadwheels}} overlapping and interleaved in {{the so-called}} Schachtellaufwerk design used by nearly all German half-tracked vehicles, mounted on swing arms sprung by torsion bars, track tension being maintained by an <b>idler</b> <b>wheel,</b> mounted at the rear.|$|R
5000|$|Structurally it is {{generally}} an American design in its features, with the first dome being a sandbox, and the second being for steam. The firebox is located above the trailing axle. After the first four were completed, the design was modified, resulting {{in a slightly different}} appearance of the smokestack and the steam dome, and smoke deflectors were added. The tender is a four-axle type, running on two four-wheel bogies of American Bettendorf design. Four units, numbers パシシ981-パシシ984, were built in 1936 with partial streamlining, featuring a shroud on top of the boiler from the chimney to the cab, giving an appearance similar to the JNR's D51 22-23 locomotives. Further, they had a fully enclosed cab, a headlamp mounted at the centre of the smokebox door, and the <b>idler</b> <b>wheels</b> and tender wheels had roller bearings. A state-of-the-art locomotive in its time, the Pashishi class first entered service pulling the [...] "Akatsuki" [...] limited express, where its performance was found to be excellent, and they were quickly put to use on the highest-value passenger trains in Korea, especially on the Gyeongbu and Gyeongui lines, such as the [...] "Akatsuki" [...] limited express mentioned previously, along with other express trains, and trains connecting to South Manchuria Railway express trains at Sinuiju/Andong.|$|E

50|$|Initial {{production}} Jagdpanzer 38 {{did not sit}} {{even with}} the ground because the gun, transmission and thicker frontal armor weighed the front down. The Leaf springs were strengthened from June 1944, which leveled the posture of the vehicle. From May-July 1944, accessibility was improved {{in the form of}} more hatches: commander's smaller hatch opening to the rear, then right rear corner for radiator access, and left rear corner for fuel tank access. From August 1944, lighter inner and outer mantles reduced the weight by 200 kg. These were more conical looking compared with the half cone shaped initial mantles. Also from August 1944, new rear <b>idler</b> <b>wheels</b> were introduced that had 8, 6, and 4 (not necessarily in that order) lightening holes instead of 12. These simplified the manufacturing process. In September 1944, the front 16 spring leaves were increased in thickness to 9mm per leaf (the rear 16 remained 7mm thick). Also in September, the side Schurtzen's front and rear tips were bent inward to prevent them from catching bushes and get dismounted. It was discovered that the driver's periscope housing acted like a shot trap, preventing incoming shells from bouncing off the front glacis. The protruding housing was removed, instead the periscope was inserted into vertical cuts to the front armor from October 1944. Also from October 44, a flame reducing muffler was introduced. These reduced visibility and backfire. A head cushion was added to the commander's hatch from October 1944. At the same time, road wheel's rims were riveted instead of using bolts. To cope with the heavy front, and the necessity to traverse the vehicle to aim, the gear ratio was lowered from 1:7.33 to 1:8 to reduce the stress on final gears from January 1945. A buttoned-down Jagdpanzer 38 was blind to its right side. Since 20mm side armor (same as late model Panzer II's side armor) was only adequate to protect the crew from fairly small caliber guns, it was important to face the threat frontally. Hence, the commander's field of view was planned to be improved by installing a rotating periscope in the Jagdpanzer 38 Starr, just as the Sturmgeschutz III and Elefant had evolved from a single pair of periscopes to all around vision blocks. However, the Jagdpanzer 38 Starr came too late to see the action in the field.|$|E

5000|$|Costlier {{turntables}} {{made from}} heavy aluminium castings have greater balanced mass and inertia, helping minimize vibration at the stylus, and maintaining constant speed without wow or flutter, {{even if the}} motor exhibits cogging effects. Like stamped steel turntables, they were topped with rubber. Because of the increased mass, they usually employed ball bearings or roller bearings in the spindle to reduce friction and noise. Most are belt or direct drive, but some use an <b>idler</b> <b>wheel.</b> A specific case was the Swiss [...] "Lenco" [...] drive, which possessed a very heavy turntable coupled via an <b>idler</b> <b>wheel</b> to a long, tapered motor drive shaft. This enabled stepless rotation or speed control on the drive. Because of this feature the Lenco became popular in the late 1950s with dancing schools, because the dancing instructor could lead the dancing exercises at different speeds.|$|R
