50|$|The {{second major}} change in 1876 was the {{addition}} of an ornate 60 x 85 foot white and gold ballroom where the Opera House used to be. Three huge partially electric crystal chandeliers, banners, and flags hung from the 27’6” foot ceiling. Over a white pine <b>floor</b> <b>hung</b> an allegorical painting by Adolphe Yvon,The Genius of America, weighing 600 pounds.|$|R
50|$|The Thomas S. Sprague House was a 2-1/2 story Queen Anne / Shingle style house. The front facade had {{a variety}} of {{projecting}} and receding elements, and {{a variety of}} surface treatments, creating an asymmetric composition with rich texture. A one-story hipped roof porch covered the center entrance, and wrapped around a corner octagonal turret. To the side of the entrance was a triple window surmounted with stained glass. Double <b>hung</b> first <b>floor</b> windows in the turret were also topped by arched stained glass sections. The turret was topped with a gable which made the structure into a bay window. Another bay window was set into {{the opposite side of the}} facade.|$|R
50|$|In {{contrast}} to locomotives of other classes, the transformer in class 101 is <b>hung</b> underneath the <b>floor</b> {{of the engine}} room on the frame, which enabled a very clean and uncluttered configuration of the engine room. This also caused {{the design of the}} transformer to be quite different from previous locomotives. The tank is constructed of light weight steel, but needed to be rugged enough to withstand a minor derailment or other accident; hence, some areas were reinforced with stronger welded sections.|$|R
60|$|At about {{a quarter}} of a mile from the house, the road {{branched}} away to the left to disappear suddenly over the edge of a drop of many hundreds of feet. Tallente passed through a plain white gate, down an avenue of dwarfed oaks, to emerge into an unexpectedly green meadow, cloven through the middle with a straight white avenue. Through another gate he passed into a drive which led through flaming banks of rhododendrons, now a little past their full glory, to the front of the house, a long and amplified building which, by reason of many additions, had become an abode of some pretensions. A manservant answered his ring at once and led him into a cool, white stone hall, the walls of which were <b>hung</b> from <b>floor</b> to ceiling with hunting and sporting trophies.|$|R
50|$|The team {{proceeded}} {{to construct the}} Mies townhomes, which ultimately would be 186 units in four designs: there were {{a small number of}} two, three, and four-bedroom ranch-style townhomes with courtyards, with the balance being three-bedroom, two-story townhouses. The low-rise housing was set several feet above grade to minimize views of automobiles and generally featured central parking lots serving multiple buildings, but the courtyard homes had driveways that led to the front door. The general construction of the low-rise houses was a lightweight steel space frame from which 3-inch concrete slabs were <b>hung</b> for <b>floors</b> and glass panels for front and rear walls. The units are separated by fire brick walls and topped with flat roofs. The ends are capped by a grey-beige slip-coated brick common to the era. Two-story units are essentially glass on both ends, bisected on the first floor by a mechanical core, containing the kitchen.|$|R
60|$|By Sirius! {{there was}} a biped I felt sorry for. He was a little man with sandy hair and {{whiskers}} a good deal like mine. Henpecked?--well, toucans and flamingoes and pelicans all had their bills in him. He wiped the dishes and listened to my mistress tell about the cheap, ragged things the lady with the squirrel-skin coat on the second <b>floor</b> <b>hung</b> out on her line to dry. And every evening while she was getting supper she made him take me out {{on the end of}} a string for a walk.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, Peace Corps {{volunteers who}} had {{completed}} their service joined protesters of the Vietnam {{war in the}} United States. [...] In May, 1970 more than 100,000 protesters converged on Washington to protest the Kent State shootings and the Nixon administrations incursion into Cambodia. One afternoon a group of returned volunteers came into Peace Corps headquarters {{and went to the}} fourth floor which was the Southeast Asia section of the Peace Corps. The returned volunteers, members of an organization called the [...] "Committee of Returned Volunteers," [...] forced staff to leave the <b>floor,</b> <b>hung</b> a Viet Cong flag from a window almost within sight of the White House, and took possession of the entire floor for 36 hours.|$|R
6000|$|But {{they had}} {{found it in the}} drawing room. Not that one could ever see them. The window panes {{reflected}} apples, reflected roses; all the leaves were green in the glass. If they moved in the drawing room, the apple only turned its yellow side. Yet, the moment after, if the door was opened, spread about the <b>floor,</b> <b>hung</b> upon the walls, pendant from the ceiling--what? My hands were empty. The shadow of a thrush crossed the carpet; from the deepest wells of silence the wood pigeon drew its bubble of sound. [...] "Safe, safe, safe," [...] the pulse of the house beat softly. [...] "The treasure buried; the room ..." [...] the pulse stopped short. Oh, was that the buried treasure? ...|$|R
6000|$|Then {{came the}} happy {{day when the}} secret was revealed, and {{afterwards}} the pleasant years when poor Mrs. Blyth's most splendid visions of luxury were all gradually realized through her husband's exertions in his profession. But for his wife's influence, Valentine {{would have been in}} danger of abandoning high Art and Classical Landscape altogether, for cheap portrait-painting, cheap copying, and cheap studies of Still Life. But Mrs. Blyth, bedridden as she was, contrived to preserve all her old influence over the labors of the Studio, and would ask for nothing new, and receive nothing new, in her room, except on condition that her husband was to paint at least one picture of High Art every year, for the sake (as she proudly said) of [...] "asserting his intellect and his reputation {{in the eyes of the}} public." [...] Accordingly, Mr. Blyth's time was pretty equally divided between the production of great unsaleable [...] "compositions," [...] which were always hung near the ceiling in the Exhibition, and of small marketable commodities, which were as invariably <b>hung</b> near the <b>floor.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{location}} in Manhattan is given variously as 50 Broadway and 52 Broadway, going through to New Street. Though it was 108 ft (33 m) deep, {{the building had}} just 21 feet, 6 inches (6.5 m) of frontage on Broadway, necessitating its novel design. Chicago's Home Insurance Building (completed 1884) {{was the first to}} use structural steel, but that building did not fully support its masonry elements on the steel frame. On the narrow lot, a conventional design with load-bearing masonry walls would have left little room on the ground floor, but architect Gilbert asked, [...] "Why can't I run my foundation far {{up in the air and}} then begin my building?" [...] Gilbert's design came from a railroad bridge turned on its end. Cast iron columns about 6m (18 feet) apart formed the skeleton, and the walls of each <b>floor</b> <b>hung</b> on a [...] "shoe" [...] instead of transmitting the load to the wall of the floor below. The resulting structure was 39 m / 129 feet in height, and 11 stories high. Gilbert made models to convince the city to permit the construction of his unusual design. It was quickly followed by taller steel-skeleton buildings, including the Columbia Building in 1890.|$|R
6000|$|... bridge,* [A {{sketch of}} one of these bridges will be found in Vol. ii.] about eighty yards long, ever rocking over the torrent (forty feet below). The {{lightness}} and extreme simplicity of its structure were very remarkable. Two parallel canes, on the same horizontal plane, were stretched across the stream; from them others hung in loops, and along the loops were laid one or two bamboo stems for flooring; cross pieces below this <b>flooring,</b> <b>hung</b> from the two upper canes, which they thus served to keep apart. The traveller grasps one of the canes in either hand, and walks along the loose bamboos laid on the swinging loops: the motion is great, and the rattling of the loose dry bamboos is neither a musical sound, nor one calculated to inspire confidence; the whole structure seeming as if about to break down. With shoes {{it is not easy to}} walk; and even with bare feet it is often difficult, there being frequently but one bamboo, which, if the fastening is loose, tilts up, leaving the pedestrian suspended over the torrent by the slender canes. When properly and strongly made, with good fastenings, and a floor of bamboos laid transversely, these bridges are easy to cross. The canes are procured from a species of Calamus; they are as thick as the finger, and twenty, or thirty yards long, knotted together; and the other pieces are fastened to them by strips of the same plant. A Lepcha, carrying one hundred and forty pounds on his back, crosses without hesitation, slowly but steadily, and with perfect confidence.|$|R
60|$|June 10th.--My {{wife and}} I {{went to the}} Pitti Palace to-day; and first entered a court where, yesterday, she had seen a carpet of flowers, {{arranged}} for some great ceremony. It {{must have been a}} most beautiful sight, the pavement of the court being entirely covered by them, in a regular pattern of brilliant lines, so as really to be a living mosaic. This morning, however, the court had nothing but its usual stones, and the show of yesterday seemed so much the more inestimable as having been so evanescent. Around the walls of the court there were still some pieces of splendid tapestry which had made part of yesterday's magnificence. We went up the staircase, of regally broad and easy ascent, and made application to be admitted to see the grand-ducal apartments. An attendant accordingly took the keys, and ushered us first into a great hall with a vaulted ceiling, and then through a series of noble rooms, with rich frescos above and mosaic <b>floors,</b> <b>hung</b> with damask, adorned with gilded chandeliers, and glowing, in short, with more gorgeousness than I could have imagined beforehand, or can now remember. In many of the rooms were those superb antique cabinets which I admire more than any other furniture ever invented; only these were of unexampled art and glory, inlaid with precious stones, and with beautiful Florentine mosaics, both of flowers and landscapes,--each cabinet worth a lifetime's toil to make it, and the cost a whole palace to pay for it. Many of the rooms were covered with arras, of landscapes, hunting-scenes, mythological subjects, or historical scenes, equal to pictures in truth of representation, and possessing an indescribable richness that makes them preferable as a mere adornment of princely halls and chambers. Some of the rooms, as I have said, were laid in mosaic of stone and marble, otherwise in lovely patterns of various woods; others were covered with carpets, delightful to tread upon, and glowing like the living floor of flowers which my wife saw yesterday. There were tables, too, of Florentine mosaic, the mere materials of which--lapis lazuli, malachite, pearl, and a hundred other precious things--were worth a fortune, and made a thousand times more valuable by the artistic skill of the manufacturer. I toss together brilliant words by the handful, and make a rude sort of patchwork, but can record no adequate idea of what I saw in this suite of rooms; and the taste, the subdued splendor, so that it did not shine too high, but was all tempered into an effect at once grand and soft,--this was quite as remarkable as the gorgeous material. I have seen a very dazzling effect produced in the principal cabin of an American clipper-ship quite opposed to this in taste.|$|R
