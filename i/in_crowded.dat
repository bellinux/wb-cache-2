5|$|Transmission {{may occur}} via {{consumption}} of contaminated water, or when people share personal objects. In places with {{wet and dry}} seasons, water quality typically worsens during the wet season, and this correlates with the time of outbreaks. In {{areas of the world}} with four seasons, infections are more common in the winter. Bottle-feeding of babies with improperly sanitized bottles is a significant cause on a global scale. Transmission rates are also related to poor hygiene, especially among children, <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> households, and in those with pre-existing poor nutritional status. After developing tolerance, adults may carry certain organisms without exhibiting signs or symptoms, and thus act as natural reservoirs of contagion. While some agents (such as Shigella) only occur in primates, others may occur {{in a wide variety of}} animals (such as Giardia).|$|E

25|$|In {{metropolitan}} areas, {{stray voltage}} issues {{have become a}} major concern. Many of these areas have large amounts of aging underground and aboveground electrical distribution equipment <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> public spaces.

25|$|Social distancing: By {{traveling}} less, {{working from}} home or closing schools, there is less opportunity for the virus to spread. Reduce the time spent <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> settings if possible. And keep your distance (preferably at least 1 metre) from people who show symptoms of influenza-like illness, such as coughing and sneezing.|$|E

25|$|The {{courtesy}} {{campaign was}} to be an annual effort {{by the government to}} encourage the people to adopt a more courteous attitude and lifestyle. It was seen as a means of ensuring a smooth transition to a new Singapore which would be densely populated, where people lived and worked in high rise towns, offices and factories, while travelling <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> buses and lifts.|$|E
25|$|Security {{staff at}} many {{sporting}} venues frown on such behaviour, and will often attempt to confiscate the empty cups from people building a beer snake.

40|$|This study {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} social stress and gender role differentiation. Crowd and collective behavior literature suggests two competing hypotheses. Social contagion theories suggest that gender roles become dedifferentiated <b>in</b> <b>crowds.</b> Social structural theories suggest that gender roles <b>in</b> <b>crowds</b> parallel institutional gender roles. The case study format is {{used to assess the}} relationship. Six crowd events, representing varying levels of social stress, were observed. Data were gathered via systematic observations, interviews and document analysis. The findings indicate that gender roles <b>in</b> <b>crowds</b> parallel institutional gender roles.

25|$|Another type of pass is the bounce pass. Here, the passer bounces {{the ball}} crisply {{about two-thirds of}} the way from his own chest to the receiver. The ball strikes the court and bounces up toward the receiver. The bounce pass takes longer to {{complete}} than the chest pass, but it is also harder for the opposing team to intercept (kicking the ball deliberately is a violation). Thus, players often use the bounce pass <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> moments, or to pass around a defender.|$|E
25|$|At the {{beginning}} of Napoleon's reign, Paris had {{a population of about}} one million people, most of whom lived <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> and unhealthy conditions. A cholera epidemic in the overcrowded center in 1848 killed twenty thousand people. In 1853, Napoleon launched a gigantic public works program under the direction of his new Prefect of the Seine, Georges-Eugène Haussmann, whose purpose was to put unemployed Parisians to work and bring clean water, light and open space to the centre of the city.|$|E
25|$|One {{criticism}} {{aimed at}} Percival was {{his decision to}} deploy the British 53rd Infantry Brigade to the front line. The brigade had disembarked at Singapore on 13 January, just three days earlier before {{being sent to the}} front, after nearly three months at sea <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> troopships, travelling from England to the east coast of Africa, where they had no exercise whatsoever. The brigade, part of the 18th Division, was originally assigned {{to take part in the}} North African Campaign, but the troopships were redirected to Singapore when the Japanese invaded Malaya.|$|E

25|$|Initially, the Portuguese {{relied on}} native slaves {{to work on}} {{sugarcane}} harvesting and processing, but they soon began importing black African slaves. Portugal owned several commercial facilities in Western Africa, where slaves were bought from African merchants. These slaves were then sent by ship to Brazil, chained and <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> conditions. The idea of using African slaves in colonial farms based on monoculture was also adopted by other European colonial powers when colonizing tropical regions of America (Spain in Cuba, France in Haiti, the Netherlands in the Dutch Antilles and England in Jamaica).|$|E
25|$|The domesticated form, {{compared}} to the wild form, has increased cocoon size, body size, growth rate, and efficiency of its digestion. It has also gained tolerance to human presence and handling and living <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> conditions. It cannot fly, so needs human assistance in finding a mate, and it lacks fear of potential predators. Color pigments are also lost so they are leucistic, because camouflage isn't useful since it can only live in captivity. These changes have made it entirely dependent upon humans for survival. The eggs are kept in incubators to aid in their hatching.|$|E
25|$|Irgun and Lehi {{followed}} their strategy of placing bombs <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> markets and bus-stops. As on 30 December, in Haifa, {{when members of}} Irgun, threw two bombs at a crowd of Arab workers who were queueing {{in front of a}} refinery, killing 6 of them and injuring 42. An angry crowd massacred 39 Jewish people in revenge, until British soldiers reestablished calm. In reprisals, some soldiers from the strike force, Palmach and the Carmeli brigade, attacked the village of Balad ash-Sheikh and Hawassa. According to different historians, this attack led to between 21 and 70 deaths.|$|E

25|$|Sanitation, {{necessary}} for good health <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> conditions, requires {{water supply and}} waste management {{as well as individual}} hygiene. Urban water systems include principally a water supply network and a network for wastewater including sewage and stormwater. Historically, either local governments or private companies have administered urban water supply, with a tendency toward government water supply in the 20th century and a tendency toward private operation {{at the turn of the}} twenty-first. The market for private water services is dominated by two French companies, Veolia Water (formerly Vivendi) and Engie (formerly Suez), said to hold 70% of all water contracts worldwide.|$|E
25|$|Entering somebody's {{personal}} space is normally {{an indication of}} familiarity and sometimes intimacy. However, in modern society, especially <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> urban communities, {{it can be difficult}} to maintain {{personal space}}, for example when in a crowded train, elevator or street. Many people find such physical proximity to be psychologically disturbing and uncomfortable, though it is accepted as a fact of modern life. In an impersonal, crowded situation, eye contact tends to be avoided. Even in a crowded place, preserving personal space is important, and intimate and sexual contact, such as frotteurism and groping, is unacceptable physical contact.|$|E
25|$|Elephant seals {{communicate}} though various means. Males will threaten {{each other}} with the snort, a sound caused by expelling air though their probosces, and the clap-trap, a loud, clapping sound comparable {{to the sound of}} a diesel engine. Pups will vocalize when stressed or when prodding their mothers to allow them to suckle. Females make an unpulsed attraction call when responding to their young, and a harsh, pulsed call when threatened by other females, males or alien pups. Elephant seals produce low-frequency sounds, both substrate-borne and air-borne. These sounds help maintain social hierarchy <b>in</b> <b>crowded</b> or noisy environments and reduce energy consumption when fasting.|$|E
