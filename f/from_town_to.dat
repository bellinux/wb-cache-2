5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1886, Macdonald {{traveled}} for the only time to western Canada, traveling <b>from</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> town by private railway car, and addressing large crowds. Macdonald traveled with his wife, {{and to get a}} better view, the two would sometimes sit in front of the locomotive on the train's cowcatcher. On 13 August 1886, Macdonald used a silver hammer and pounded a gold spike to complete the Esquimalt and Nanaimo Railway.|$|E
5|$|Hadspen was an {{important}} stop on the coach route from Launceston to Deloraine from at least the 1840s. The coach service declined from when rail transport started in Tasmania in the late 1860s. The State Government began operating a school bus <b>from</b> <b>town,</b> <b>to</b> Hagley, in the 1930s. Meander Valley Highway, formerly known as Bass Highway, passes through {{the edge of the}} town bypassing the old main street. Bass Highway, which connects Launceston, Burnie and Devonport, branches off from this east of the town at Travellers Rest and passes south of Hadspen.|$|E
5|$|In the meantime, O'Reilly taught English {{to primary}} school {{children}} in Griffith, {{as well as}} singing—most of the pieces were Irish. At Rylstone he taught book-keeping and business, and {{he was promoted to}} the high school at Kandos. During this time he supplemented his income by travelling <b>from</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> town, playing in one-off cricket matches {{at the expense of the}} host's club. He worked on his bosie during the period and regularly dismissed outclassed opposition batsmen. O'Reilly regarded his cricketing isolation as highly beneficial as he regarded coaches to be ill-advised and detrimental to development.|$|E

He was educated at local schools and on most days, before starting lessons, would milk a herd of 40 cows. When he was 12, he {{ran away from home}} after an argument with his father. He found a job at a grocer's in a nearby town but after a year signed on as a galleyhand aboard a Norwegian whaling ship, which spent the 1921/1922 whaling season in the Southern Ocean. On his return, and after reconciling with his parents, he started working as a shepherd. He soon tired of this and began the life of a swagman, working <b>from</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> town as he travelled around the South Island.|$|E

5|$|The Luna Defense Line {{was planned}} {{to create a}} series of delaying battles from Caloocan to Angeles, Pampanga, as the Republic was {{constructing}} a guerrilla base in the Mountain Province.

American military observers were astonished by the Defense Line, which they described as consisting of numerous bamboo trenches stretching <b>from</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> town. The series of trenches allowed the Filipinos to withdraw gradually, firing from cover at the advancing Americans. As the American troops occupied each new position, they were subjected to a series of traps that had been set in the trenches, which included bamboo spikes and poisonous reptiles.|$|E

5|$|The Mongols {{attacked}} the Dalmatian cities {{for the next}} few years but eventually withdrew without major success, as the mountainous terrain and distance were not suitable for their style of warfare. They pursued Béla IV <b>from</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> town in Dalmatia. The Croatian nobility and Dalmatian towns such as Trogir and Rab helped Béla IV to escape. After this failure, the Mongols retreated and Béla IV rewarded the Croatian towns and nobility. Only the city of Split did not help Béla IV in his escape.|$|E
5|$|The Mongols {{crossed the}} frozen Danube early in 1242. A Mongol {{detachment}} {{under the command}} of Kadan, a son of Great Khan Ögödei, chased Béla <b>from</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> town in Dalmatia. Béla took refugee in the well-fortified Trogir. Before Kadan laid siege to the town in March, news arrived of the Great Khan's death. Batu Khan wanted to attend at the election of Ögödei's successor with sufficient troops and ordered the withdrawal of all Mongol forces. Béla, who was grateful to Trogir, granted it lands near Split, causing a lasting conflict between the two Dalmatian towns.|$|E

These rings are a group of legendary {{artifacts}} with the power to resurrect the dead and grant immortality to anyone who collects 12 of them. The series has a Weird West setting which mixes a background of sparsely populated frontier settlements and gunslinger aesthetics with modern conveniences, occult magic, supernatural martial arts, and mad science. The trio travel <b>from</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> town in this world, fighting other criminals for possession of the Rings of the Dead. The protagonists obtain three of the rings {{in the course of the}} story, but due to the series' cancellation, the eventual success or failure of their quest is unknown.|$|E

5|$|The game is set after {{a fictional}} World War III, {{the events of}} which have killed off much of the population; those left alive are forced to fight for survival. Some of the {{survivors}} have formed gangs, some turned into mutants from the war's radiation, and some joined an evil militia; collectively, these groups are known as Wastelanders. Raiding different towns and villages, the Wastelanders sought to prey on the townspeople by stealing supplies, forcing some into slavery, and killing others. The heroine of the story, Angel, travels <b>from</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> town in search of her lost friend, Ekx, while helping the town's survivors fend off attacks from Wastelanders. Cruising in her armored car, Gypsy, she makes use of the car's mounted machine guns to defend the towns from thieves and slavers. The first lead Angel finds on her lost friend is {{from the city of}} Core, where Ekx was seen traveling through the city on his way to Coalhaven. Angel reaches Coalhaven and uses her armored car to defend the city from members of the renegade militia. After repelling the enemy, the townspeople re-establish their wireless communications and contact the nearby city of New Dallas. Recognizing the voice on the other end, the receiving operator in New Dallas turns out to be Angel's lost friend, Ekx. Ekx confides in Angel that he needs her for something urgent and that she must join him in New Dallas.|$|E
5|$|The story, told {{through the}} use of voiced and {{animated}} comic panels, centers on Angel, a heroine in a post-apocalyptic United States that travels <b>from</b> <b>town</b> <b>to</b> town protecting helpless survivors of the war from attacking gangs. Angel defends the towns using Gypsy, the name given to her armored car equipped with mounted machine guns. The game uses an overhead view as the player speeds around a small town using Gypsy's machine guns to repel enemy gangs known as Wastelanders. There are three types of Wastelanders and each one unleashes attacks in a different manner: The Slavers class will attempt to capture the townspeople, Killers will only attack the player, and Duals can take on either the role of attacking or capturing during a raid. When enemies are killed, they leave behind weapons for the player such as napalm, land mines, or Electromagnetic pulse bombs (EMPs); or they drop upgrades which improve the car's weapons or armor. The EMPs are used to temporarily disable all the enemies on the screen while the napalm and land mines can be set between waves as traps for unsuspecting Wastelanders. One weapon upgrade offers players incendiary ammunition for the car's machine guns which makes it easier to destroy enemies by lighting them on fire.|$|E
