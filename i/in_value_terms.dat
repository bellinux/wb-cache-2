5|$|The De Beers company, as the world's largest diamond mining company, holds a {{dominant}} {{position in the}} industry, and has done so since soon after its founding in 1888 by the British imperialist Cecil Rhodes. De Beers is currently the world's largest operator of diamond production facilities (mines) and distribution channels for gem-quality diamonds. The Diamond Trading Company (DTC) is a subsidiary of De Beers and markets rough diamonds from De Beers-operated mines. De Beers and its subsidiaries own mines that produce some 40% of annual world diamond production. For most of the 20th century over 80% of the world's rough diamonds passed through De Beers, but by 2001–2009 the figure had decreased to around 45%, and by 2013 the company's market share had further decreased to around 38% <b>in</b> <b>value</b> <b>terms</b> and even less by volume. De Beers sold off {{the vast majority of}} its diamond stockpile in the late 1990s – early 2000s and the remainder largely represents working stock (diamonds that are being sorted before sale). This was well documented in the press but remains little known to the general public.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{employs a}} three-period-overlapping generations model to discuss intergenerational (in-) {{efficiency}} of a PAYG system when labor supply is endogenous. Four main {{results will be}} derived. First, a pension system is (constrained) efficient if the existing system itself and reforms are restricted to guarantee that benefits are proportional to contributions <b>in</b> present <b>value</b> <b>terms.</b> Second, the result does not carry over to other pension systems where {{the benefits of a}} retiree are proportional to weighted individual contributions. Third, if the actual PAYG scheme is not a second-best-optimum for some generations, a welfare improving reform is possible provided that the government is not restricted to systems with partial equivalence of contributions and benefits <b>in</b> present <b>value</b> <b>terms.</b> A Pareto-improving transition from the PAYG system to a fully funded system might become feasible provided that the change in the pension scheme is accompanied by an adequate compensating redistribution among generations. Fourth, partial equivalence <b>in</b> present <b>value</b> <b>terms,</b> which requires uniform benefit-adjusted taxation of labor income, does not ensure intergenerational efficiency in all circumstances. However, if uniform benefit-adjusted taxation were optimal, a pension system like the German PAYG system would not be intergenerationally efficient since it misses partial equivalence <b>in</b> present <b>value</b> <b>terms.</b> Pay-as-you-go pension system, overlapping-generations model, intergenerational efficiemncy...|$|R

In Lange's view, this model qualified as socialist because the means of production would be publicly owned with returns to the public enterprises accruing to society as a whole in a social dividend, while worker's self-management could be introduced in the public enterprises.|$|E

5000|$|Water use is inefficient if {{the same}} purpose of its use can be {{accomplished}} with less water. Technical efficiency, derives from engineering practice where it is typically {{used to describe the}} ratio of output to input. Technical efficiency is useful in comparing various products and processes. [...] For example, one showerhead would be considered more efficient than another if it could accomplish the same purpose (i.e., of showering) by using less water or other inputs (e.g., lower water pressure). However, the technical efficiency concept is not useful in making decisions of investing money (or resources) in water conservation measures unless the inputs and outputs are measured <b>in</b> <b>value</b> <b>terms.</b> This expression of efficiency is referred to as economic efficiency.|$|E
50|$|Coffee {{historically}} {{has been a}} major factor in the Colombian economy. Since the middle of the twentieth century, however, its relative importance has been decreasing, largely as a natural outcome of the country's development process. The increase in the share of the services sector, as the nation has developed, corresponded to the reduction of coffee in both GDP and exports. Whereas in 1985 coffee exports represented 51 percent of total exports <b>in</b> <b>value</b> <b>terms,</b> they represented less than 6 percent in 2006. However, the relative decline in coffee's share of both GDP and exports should not imply that coffee has ceased to be a determining factor both in economic and social terms. The livelihoods of an estimated 566,000 families, some 2.3 million Colombians, depend entirely on coffee.|$|E

In contrast to a free-market price system, [...] "socialist" [...] prices would be set by a planning board to equal the marginal cost of production to achieve neoclassical pareto efficiency. Because this model of socialism relied upon money and administered prices as opposed to non-monetary calculation in physical magnitudes, it was labelled [...] "market socialism". In effect, Oskar Lange conceded that calculations in a socialist system {{would have to be}} performed <b>in</b> <b>value</b> <b>terms</b> with a functioning price system rather than using purely natural or engineering criteria as in the classic concept of socialism.|$|E
