5|$|Henry Edward Roberts studied <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineering</b> at the University of Miami before enlisting in the U.S. Air Force in 1962. He {{soon became}} an {{electronics}} {{instructor at the}} Cryptographic Equipment Maintenance School at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas. To augment his meager enlisted man's pay, Roberts worked on several off-duty projects and even set up a one-man company, Reliance Engineering. The most notable job was to create the electronics that animated the Christmas characters in the window display of Joske's department store in San Antonio. In 1965, he was selected for an Air Force program to complete his college degree, and became a commissioned officer. Roberts earned an <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineering</b> degree from Oklahoma State University in 1968 and {{was assigned to the}} Weapons Laboratory at Kirtland AFB in Albuquerque, New Mexico.|$|E

5|$|Bush left Tufts in 1919, {{although}} he remained employed by AMRAD, {{and joined the}} Department of <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineering</b> at MIT, where he worked under Dugald C. Jackson. In 1922, he collaborated with fellow MIT professor William H. Timbie on Principles of <b>Electrical</b> <b>Engineering,</b> an introductory textbook. AMRAD's lucrative contracts from World War I had been cancelled, and Bush attempted to reverse the company's fortunes by developing a thermostatic switch invented by Al Spencer, an AMRAD technician, on his own time. AMRAD's management {{was not interested in}} the device, but had no objection to its sale. Bush found backing from Laurence K. Marshall and Richard S. Aldrich to create the Spencer Thermostat Company, which hired Bush as a consultant. The new company soon had revenues in excess of a million dollars. It merged with General Plate Company to form Metals & Controls Corporation in 1931, and with Texas Instruments in 1959. Texas Instruments sold it to Bain Capital in 2006, and it became a separate company again as Sensata Technologies in 2010.|$|E

40|$|As future {{generation}} <b>electrical,</b> information <b>engineering</b> and mechatronics become specialized and fragmented, {{it is easy}} to {{lose sight}} of the fact that many topics in these areas have common threads and, because of this, advances in one discipline may be transmitted to others. The 2011 International Conference on <b>Electrical,</b> Information <b>Engineering</b> and Mechatronics (EIEM 2011) is the first conference that attempts to follow the above idea of hybridization in <b>electrical,</b> information <b>engineering,</b> mechatronics and applications. This Proceedings of the 2011 International Conference on <b>Electrical,</b> Information <b>Engineering</b> and Mechatronics provides a forum for engineers and scientists to address the most innovative research and development including technical challenges and social, legal, political, and economic issues, and to present and discuss their ideas, results, works in progress and experience on all aspects of <b>electrical,</b> information <b>engineering,</b> mechatronics and applications. Engineers and scientists in academia, industry, and government will find a insights into the solutions that combine ideas from multiple disciplines in order to achieve something more significant than the sum of the individual parts in all aspects of <b>electrical,</b> information <b>engineering,</b> mechatronics and applications...|$|R
