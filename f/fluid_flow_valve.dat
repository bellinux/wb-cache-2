40|$|The {{numerical}} simulation model presented {{is based on}} the integration of the fluid conservation equations (continuity, momentum and energy) in the whole compressor domain (compression chamber, valves, manifolds, mufflers, connecting tubes, parallel paths, etc.) using instantaneous local mean values for the different variables. It is interesting to remark how momentum equation has been taken into account in all compressor parts and the possibility to solve parallel paths, resonators, etc. Effective flow areas are evaluated considering multidimensional models based on modal analysis of fluid interaction in the valve. Then, second and third order vibration models of valve are also considered. The possibility to use compound bound has been also implemented. The force balances in the crankshaft connecting rod mechanical system are simultaneously solved at each time-step considered in the thermal and fluid dynamic compressor model. It allows to evaluate the instantaneous compression chamber volume and the different forces in the crankshaft connecting rod mechanical system. Mechanical system forces allows to know important information to predict possible over-stresses in piston, piston pin, crankshaft, connecting rod, etc. The thermal analysis of the solid elements is based on global energy balances at each macro volume considered (shell, muffler, tubes, cylinder head, crankcase, motor, etc.). Some improvements can be implemented (shell conduction, heat transfer coefficient evaluation, etc.). The resulting governing equations (<b>fluid</b> <b>flow,</b> <b>valve</b> dynamics, conduction heat transfer in solids, etc.) are discretized by means of a fully implicit control volume formulation. The complete set of algebraic equations are coupled using the segregated he complete set of algebraic equations are coupled using the segregated pressure based algorithm Semi-Implicit Method for Pressure-Linked Equations(SIMPLEC) extended to compressible flow. Second and third time order schemes have been implemented for the transient terms. An extensive hermetic reciprocating compressor experimental validation has been presented and the experimental know-how acquired has been highlighted. Furthermore, two commercial hermetic reciprocating compressor have been instrumented in detail to obtain the thermal temperatures map and the pressure fluid evolutions along compressor for different working conditions. It is interesting to remark as a novelty, the use of very small absolute pressure transducers, instead of the standard relative transducers. They allow to know instantaneous absolute pressure inside compressor chamber, without the necessity of measurement an absolute pressure outside the compression chamber (as is usual in this kind of experimental works). The global comparative results have allowed to check the possibilities of the {{numerical simulation}} presented above and its accuracy compared with experimental data. After that, this work show the capabilities offered by the simulation presented and its final objective, {{a better understanding of the}} thermal and fluid dynamic compressor behaviour to improve the design of these equipments. Then, the objective has been to review and present different physically meaningful parameters that characterize the reciprocating compressor behaviour (volumetric efficiency, isentropic efficiency, heat transfer efficiency, mechanical, electrical and heat losses, Coefficient of Performance, etc.), their influence detachment and evolution under different working conditions, with the idea to predict the performance of hermetic reciprocating compressors under different working conditions using the above mentioned non-dimensional parameters. Finally, a parametric study of hermetic reciprocating compressors behaviour has been carried out. Results presented show the influence of different aspects (geometry, valves, motor, working conditions, etc.) in the compressor behaviour. The parametric studies and compressor characterization detachment allows also a better implementation of simplest models of the compressors in the thermal and fluid dynamic numerical simulation of vapour compressor cycles together with the rest of elements.

Fluids in the Reykjanes geothermal system react with mid-ocean ridge basalt at temperatures {{as high as}} 346 °C and contain Fe 9 - 140 ppm, Cu 14 - 17 ppm, Zn 5 - 27 ppm, Pb 120 - 290 ppb, 1 - 6 ppb Au, and 28 - 107 ppb Ag. Fluids discharged at surface from the same wells have orders of magnitude lower metal concentrations due to precipitation caused by boiling and vapor loss during depressurization. Upstream of the orifice plate at high pressure (40 bar, 252 °C) the precipitates consist mainly of sphalerite and chalcopyrite with a trace of galena and bornite. At the orifice plate of old wells, the pressure decreased sharply to 11 bar (188 °C), resulting in abundant deposition of amorphous silica together with minor sphalerite and traces of chalcopyrite. In new wells the pressure at the orifice plate decreases to 22 bar (220 °C); this pressure decrease and concomitant boiling causes deposition of fine-grained bornite-digenite solid solution together with sphalerite and galena on the <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> control <b>valve.</b> In high-pressure wells (average wellhead pressure 45 - 35 bar) most metals (mainly as sphalerite) are deposited downstream of the orifice plate, with up to 950 ppm Au and 2. 5 wt. % Ag.

40|$|A key {{enabling}} technology to effective on/off valve based control of hydraulic systems is the high speed on/off valve. High speed valves improve system efficiency for a given PWM fre-quency, offer faster control bandwidth, and produce smaller out-put pressure ripples. Current valves rely on the linear translation of a spool or poppet to meter <b>flow.</b> The <b>valve</b> spool must re-verse direction twice per PWM cycle. This constant acceleration and deceleration of the spool requires a power input proportional to the PWM frequency cubed. As a result, current linear valves are severely limited in their switching frequencies. In this paper, we present a novel fluid driven PWM on/off valve design {{that is based on}} a unidirectional rotary spool. The spool is rotated by capturing momentum from the <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> through the <b>valve.</b> The on/off functionality of our design is achieved via helical barri-ers that protrude from the surface of a cylindrical spool. As the spool rotates, the helical barriers selectively channel the flow to the application (on) or to tank (off). The duty ratio is controlled by altering the axial position of the spool. Since the spool no longer accelerates or decelerates during operation, the power in-put to drive the valve must only compensate for viscous friction, which is proportional to the PWM frequency squared. We predict that our current design, sized for a nominal flow rate of 40 l/m, can achieve a PWM frequency of 84 Hz. This paper presents our valve concept, design equations, and an analysis of predicted per-formance. A simulation of our design is also presented. ...|$|R

40|$|Mission Research Corporation (MRC) in {{cooperation}} with the Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL) has developed a new small remote-controlled fluid valve. The motivation for developing this valve came from the requirements of a future International Space Station experiment called Microgravity Scaling Theory Experiment (MISTE). This experiment requires an in situ, low-temperature operated, fluid valve that can be open/closed over 50 times during a 4. 5 month flight. The successful operation of MISTE and other space-based and ground-based laboratory experiments now in development will require reliable cryogenic fluid valves that are remotely operated, helium leak tight, non-magnetic, very low power, and which have a small dead volume. The new valve is normally closed and requires fluid actuation at a pressure of approximately 600 kPa to open. The heart of the valve design is found in the configuration of the valve seat and sealing poppet. The design of these two surfaces was derived from work performed previously during a five year development program for a larger MRC remote-controlled, cryogenic <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> control <b>valve.</b> More than 50 of the larger valves have been produced and delivered for space flight applications. The new small valve has only three moving parts, which move less than 0. 012 cm when the valve fully opens or closes. The bearing surfaces in the valve operating mechanism are all flexure (except for the valve poppet) and thus the valve is expected to have a lifetime of thousands of open/close cycles. The materials and processes used to fabricate the new valve have been flight certified. Results from the first extensively tested prototype show repeatable behavior with a leak rate of typically 3 108 scc=s after the first open/close cycle at 4. 2 K, rising to about 106 scc=s after 100 cycles.

40|$|A {{method for}} {{significantly}} reducing the losses {{associated with an}} on/off controlled hydraulic system is proposed. There has been a growing interest {{in the use of}} on/off valves to control hydraulic systems as a means of improving system efficiency. While on/off valves are efficient when they are fully open or fully closed, a significant amount of energy can be lost in throttling as the valve transitions between the two states when the switching times are not negligible. A soft switching approach is proposed as a method of eliminating the majority of these transition losses. The operating principle of soft switching is that <b>fluid</b> can temporarily <b>flow</b> through a check valve or into a small chamber while valve orifices are partially closed. The <b>fluid</b> can then <b>flow</b> out of the chamber once the valve has fully transitioned. Thus, <b>fluid</b> <b>flows</b> through the <b>valve</b> only when it is in its most efficient fully open state. A model of the system is derived and simulated, with results indicating that the soft switching approach can reduce transition and compressibility losses by 81 % and total system losses by 64 %. The soft switching approach has the potential to improve the efficiency of on/ off controlled systems and is particularly beneficial as switching frequencies are increased. The soft switching approach will also facilitate the use of slower on/off valves for effective on/off control; in simulation, a valve with soft switching matched the efficiency of an on/off valve that was 4. 4 times faster.

One concept uses a low melting temperature metal alloy which is injected into the joint cavity; upon solidification, the alloy provides a seal and a structural joint. The second concept {{is based on the}} differential thermal expansion of the coupling mating parts. At thermal equilibrium there is a predetermined interference between the parts, and sealing is achieved by interference loading...|$|R
25|$|Due to the {{breakage}} of one {{of three}} <b>flow</b> control <b>valves</b> on the previous flight, STS-126, the <b>flow</b> <b>valves</b> of all orbiters were subjected to tests to determine if Discovery was safe to fly. These valves are used to synchronize the flow of gaseous hydrogen between the external fuel tank and the Space Shuttle Main Engines, creating an even flow. Following the testing of the valves, mission managers decided to postpone the launch, and engineers were asked to replace the suspect <b>flow</b> <b>valves</b> with valves that had less flight time.|$|R
30|$|Simulation of {{multiphase}} <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> in naturally fractured reservoirs is {{a challenge}} due to complexity associated with flow processes in porous matrix fracture system. A detailed study of multiphase <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> for estimation of production potential of fractured reservoirs is not well documented. In this paper a full derivation of the multiphase <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> equations in a poroelastic environment is presented to accurately reflect the <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> behavior and evaluate fluid recovery under different driving mechanisms. A number of different approaches {{have been used to}} simulate immiscible multiphase <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> in fractured reservoirs. Among these approaches most notable is the dual-porosity/dual-permeability one.|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: In this article, an MR valve {{possessing}} simultaneously annular <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> resistance {{channels and}} radial <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> resistance channels is designed, and its structure and working principle are described. In addition, {{a mathematical model}} for the MR valve with both annular and radial flow paths is developed and the simulation is carried out to evaluate the newly developed MR valve. The simulation results based on the proposed model indicate that {{the efficiency of the}} MR valve with circular disk-type fluid resistance channels is superior to that with annular fluid resistance channels under the same magnetic flux density and outer radius of the valve. Furthermore, the results also show that the efficiency of the MR valve can be improved significantly with two types of <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> resistance gaps, viz. annular <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> resistance gaps and circular disk-type <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> resistance gaps simultaneously. Key Words: magnetorheological valve, annular channel, circular disk-type channel, magnetorheological <b>fluid</b> <b>flow,</b> <b>fluid</b> <b>flow</b> resistance gap...|$|R
