5|$|In 1958, Juster had {{received}} a Ford Foundation grant for a children's book about cities. Unable to make progress on that project, he turned to writing what became The Phantom Tollbooth, his first book. His housemate, Feiffer, a cartoonist, interested himself in the project. Jason Epstein, an editor at Random House, bought the book and published it. The book received rave reviews and has sold in excess of three million copies, <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> expected.

5|$|In 2010, the USDA {{reported}} that data on overall honey bee losses {{for the year}} indicate an estimated 34% loss, which is statistically similar to losses reported in 2007, 2008, and 2009.

5|$|The {{budget for}} the film's costumes was US$1,600, <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the stage {{production}} budget, but having to double up on costumes for filming was expensive. For filming, corsets for the finale had to be doubled for the pool scene, with one version drying while the other was worn on set. While many of the costumes are exact replicas from the stage productions, other costumes were new to filming, such as Columbia's gold sequined swallow-tail coat and top hat and Magenta's maid's uniform.|$|E
5|$|As a song full of {{gospel and}} soulful influences, it allowed Mariah to really tear loose and show {{what she could}} do – which in reality was <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the vocal {{gymnastics}} that seemed to comprise her reputation so far. From a deep rumble to a high wail, she covered five octaves wonderfully, as {{the power of the}} tune built. The backing vocals – which once again had those churchy harmonies – filled out the spare melody, as did the stately horns, which entered towards the end. The song was truly a vocal showcase for Mariah.|$|E
5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This is <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often {{be the result of}} an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Fast Fourier {{transform}} (FFT) -based computations can be <b>far</b> <b>more</b> accurate <b>than</b> {{the slow}} transforms suggest. Discrete Fourier transforms computed through the FFT are <b>far</b> <b>more</b> accurate <b>than</b> slow transforms, and convolutions computed via FFT are <b>far</b> <b>more</b> accurate <b>than</b> the direct results. However, these results depend critically on {{the accuracy of}} the FFT software employed, which should generally be considered suspect. Popular recursions for fast computation of the sine/cosine table (or twiddle factors) are inaccurate due to inherent instability. Some analyses of these recursions that have appeared heretofore in print, suggesting stability, are incorrect. Even in higher dimensions, the FFT is remarkably stable...|$|R

5|$|Ash died in 1887, and the United Hebrew Orthodox Congregations (now called The Association of American Orthodox Hebrew Congregations) began {{a search}} for a successor, to serve as rabbi of Beth Hamedrash Hagodol and as Chief Rabbi of New York City. This search was opposed by Rabbi Henry Pereira Mendes, of Congregation Shearith Israel. Mendes felt that the money and energy would be better spent on {{supporting}} the Jewish Theological Seminary of America (JTSA), which he had co-founded with Sabato Morais in 1886. In his view, training American-born rabbis at the Seminary would be a much more effective means of fighting the growing strength of American Reform Judaism: these native English-speaking rabbis would appeal to the younger generation <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> imported, Yiddish-speaking ones.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{entering}} the crisis {{with a low}} level of public debtroughly 40% of GDPand a moderate deficit compared to many European nations, the UK's ability to take discretionary fiscal action was limited by the burden of bank bail-outs on public finances. The tax revenue from financial services, which was conservatively estimated at 13.9% of UK tax income in 2007, fell alarmingly as the crisis affected bank profits. This contributed to a significant rise in the deficit to an estimated £175billion (12.4% of GDP) in 2009–10 and a rise in the national debt to above 80% of GDP at its peak. The UK had significant automatic stabilisers which contributed <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> discretionary action and more than most other countries.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are {{almost double the}} number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists {{as to whether it}} may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may have served as a counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E

5|$|Grič Tunnel was not {{mentioned}} again in media until 1993, when {{it served as}} the site of the Under City Rave, one of the first raves in Croatia, which was organized by the staff of the TV show Top DJ Mag, and featured DJs from as far as Germany and the UK. At the time, the tunnel was under ownership of the Museum of Contemporary Art. The event was attended by over 3,000 people, <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> the organisers planned for and the tunnel infrastructure allowed for. In 1994, it was part of an exhibition celebrating Earth Day. During the Croatian War of Independence (1991–95), the tunnel saw some use in its intended capacity as an air raid shelter.

5|$|Gromoboi {{suffered}} 87 {{dead and}} 170 wounded; <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> Rossias 44 dead and 156 wounded. This was attributable to Rossias captain's policy of ordering the gun crews for his quick-firing {{guns on the}} engaged side to lie down and those on the unengaged side to go below, {{in contrast to the}} Gromoboi keeping her light guns manned at all times. Gromoboi was hit fifteen times on the starboard side of her hull and seven times on her port side, plus other hits in her funnels, boats and decks. She also suffered a fire caused by the ignition of excess propellant charges. Despite this number of hits, she was not badly damaged because her waterline belt was not penetrated. She was repaired within two months by the rudimentary facilities available at Vladivostok.|$|E
5|$|Having settled {{matters in}} Khurasan, Harun {{returned}} to the west in November 805 and prepared a huge retaliatory expedition for 806, drawing men from Syria, Palestine, Persia, and Egypt. According to al-Tabari, his army numbered 135,000 regular troops and additional volunteers and freebooters.
