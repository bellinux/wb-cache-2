5000|$|The federal ban of 1994 {{defined a}} {{magazine}} capable of holding more than 10 {{rounds of ammunition}} as a large capacity ammunition <b>feeding</b> <b>device.</b> Likewise, the state of California defines a large capacity magazine as [...] "any ammunition <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> with a capacity to accept more than 10 rounds." [...] Such devices are commonly called high-capacity magazines. Among states with bans, the maximum capacity is 10 to 20 rounds. Several municipalities, such as New York City, restrict magazine capacity to 5 rounds for rifles and shotguns. The state of New York previously limited magazine capacity to 7 rounds, but a District Court ruled this ban to be excessive and could not [...] "survive intermediate scrutiny".|$|E

40|$|In general, demand <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> are {{equipped}} with a mechanical trigger switch. Such a switch is not suitable for juvenile fish with a small body size, because the body weight is insufficient to trigger the feeder. An infrared light sensor that {{does not require the}} fish to push a feeder switch is more suitable for small fish. The brown-marbled grouper Epinephelus fuscoguttatus is an important fish species in Southeast Asia. The {{purpose of this study was}} to compare the growth rates (GRs) of brown-marbled grouper juveniles reared using customised demand <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> with an infrared light sensor (the infrared light demand feeder (IRDF) group) and automatic <b>feeding</b> <b>devices</b> (the automatic feeder (AF) group). The results indicated that GRs of standard lengths and body weights showed no significant differences using one-way analysis of variance; however, the standard length of the IRDF group showed a tendency of a higher GR than the AF group. Although the feed conversion ratio (FCR) also showed no significant difference, the FCR of the IRDF group was more efficient, indicating that the IRDF group yielded a more desirable FCR. These results indicate that IRDF can be used in the culture of brown-marbled grouper juveniles. In view of the working schedule of the fish farm staff, IRDF are superior to other <b>feeding</b> <b>devices,</b> because they are less labour-intensive than usual tasks. We conclude that IRDF is a useful feeding system for aquaculture...|$|R
50|$|A {{magazine}} is an ammunition storage and <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> within or {{attached to a}} repeating firearm. Magazines can be removable (detachable) or integral to the firearm. The magazine functions by moving the cartridges stored in the magazine into {{a position where they}} may be loaded into the chamber by the action of the firearm. The detachable {{magazine is}} often referred to as a clip, although this is technically inaccurate.|$|E

50|$|The weapon {{developed}} {{on its own}} initiative, out of competition and technical tasks. The weapon has no bolt, but a stationary breech and movable barrels with its own gas cylinders with piston connected to the next barrel. Upon firing one barrel, the next one was forced backwards, and thus caused the next barrel to move forward. When firing operates a <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> that channels rounds into the barrels, with the spent cartridges ejected from both sides. The barrels {{move back and forth}} the full length of the cartridge.|$|E
50|$|A belt or {{ammunition}} belt is a device used to retain and feed cartridges into a firearm. Belts {{and the associated}} feed systems are typically employed to feed machine guns or other automatic weapons. Belt-fed systems minimize the proportional weight of the ammunition to the <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> along with allowing high rates of continuous fire. The capacity of belts and carriers is typically a function of weight and bulk. Their size is limited by caliber and the portability of the combined weapon and ammunition. The most common sizes typically carried on a man-portable weapon run from 50 to 300 rounds.|$|E
50|$|During World War II, {{as part of}} {{her work}} with wounded soldiers, Blount devised an {{apparatus}} to help amputees feed themselves. She invented an electronic <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> in 1951, a feeding tube that delivered one mouthful of food at a time, controlled by biting down on the tube. The American Veterans Administration did not accept her invention, so she sold it to the French government. Blount was once a physical therapist to the mother-in-law of Theodore Edison, son of famed inventor Thomas Edison. She and the younger Edison became close friends and while in his home she invented the disposable cardboard emesis basin. The basin was fashioned out of newspaper, flour and water, which was then baked into a hard form. This invention was also not accepted by the American Veterans Administration, so she sold it to Belgium.|$|E

2500|$|A {{semi-automatic}} firearm, or self-loading firearm, is {{one that}} not only fires a bullet each time the trigger is pulled, but also performs all steps necessary to prepare it to discharge again—assuming cartridges remain in the firearm's <b>feed</b> <b>device.</b> Typically, this includes extracting and ejecting the spent cartridge case from the firing chamber, re-cocking the firing mechanism, and loading a new cartridge into the firing chamber. To fire again, the trigger is released and re-pressed.|$|R
50|$|The DANA was a {{significant}} departure from contemporary self-propelled guns as it used a wheeled chassis and featured an innovative automated loading system which was {{the first of its kind}} at the time of its introduction to service. The vehicle has a driving cabin at the front, an open-topped fighting compartment at mid-length and the engine compartment in the rear. The front crew cabin seats both the driver/mechanic and vehicle commander. The armoured turret is installed on a traversable mount adapted to the Tatra 815 wheeled chassis (8x8) and is divided into two halves, divided by the howitzer's recoil mechanism and a pathway for the reciprocating action during firing. The left half of the turret is occupied by the gunner and first loader and houses the various fire control optics, electro-mechanical gun laying controls, the automatic propellant charge <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> as well as an auxiliary ammunition magazine. The right side of the turret contains a mechanized projectile delivery system which is operated by a second loader at this position.|$|E
50|$|In {{the food}} sector, moving or {{transporting}} fluids is achieved {{with the aid}} of pump technology. Colloquially, this is known as filling or portioning. Various different types of pumps are used, {{depending on the type of}} filling products to be moved. Vacuum fillers with vane cell feed systems and vacuum feeding are commonly used for viscous products. The products are transported {{with the aid of}} a hopper with a <b>feeding</b> <b>device,</b> a vane cell feed system under a vacuum and appropriate volume expulsion in the pump housing. This is basically a volumetric feed principle, which means that a certain weight is defined via a volume. In addition to the vane cell feed systems, also known as rotary vane pumps, there are also screw feed systems with feed augers, toothed wheel feed systems and evacuated lifting cylinders. With all these systems, transportation is achieved via volume expulsion under a vacuum.Vacuum fillers are traditionally used in the meat processing industry as well as in other food sectors. They can also be found in some non-food sectors. Generally speaking, vacuum fillers can be used for filling pasty and compressible products.|$|E
5000|$|Externally {{identical}} to the M6A3, it fires from a closed bolt during semi-automatic fire, and from an open bolt during automatic fire which is labeled as [...] "OBA" [...] for Open Bolt Automatic. While in OBA mode, the first round may be fired from a closed bolt (it will then lock back and subsequent shots will be from an open bolt until the operator manually closes the bolt again). Firing from an open bolt increases cooling and eliminates the potential for accidental discharges due to rounds [...] "cooking off" [...] in an overheated chamber. It also allows for a faster rate of fire. However, an open bolt design meant that the first round fired will have reduced accuracy when compared to a closed bolt design. This {{is due to the}} fact that when the trigger is pulled, the bolt slams forward under spring tension, stripping a round from the <b>feeding</b> <b>device,</b> chambering it, then firing it. This sequence of events shakes the firearm and takes longer than a closed bolt design to fire the first round (greater lock time). This also introduces extra potential points of failure in the ignition of the first round.|$|E

50|$|The most {{important}} medical problems are difficulties in breathing and feeding. Affected infants very often need assistance with feeding, for example needing {{to stay in}} a lateral(on the side) or prone(on the tummy) position which helps bring the tongue forward and opens up the airway. Babies with a cleft palate will need a special cleft <b>feeding</b> <b>device</b> (such as the Haberman Feeder). Infants who are unable to take in enough calories by mouth to ensure growth may need supplementation with a nasogastric tube. This is related to the difficulty in forming a vacuum in the oral cavity related to the cleft palate, as well as to breathing difficulty related to the posterior position of the tongue. Given the breathing difficulties that some babies with PRS face, they may require more calories to grow (as working of breathing is somewhat like exercising for an infant). Infants, when moderately to severely affected, may occasionally need nasopharyngeal cannulation, or placement of a nasopharyngeal tube to bypass the airway obstruction {{at the base of the}} tongue. in some places, children are discharged home with a nasopharyngeal tube for a period of time, and parents are taught how to maintain the tube. Sometimes endotracheal intubation or tracheostomy may be indicated to overcome upper respiratory obstruction. In some centers, a tongue lip adhesion is performed to bring the tongue forward, effectively opening up the airway. Mandibular distraction can be effective by moving the jaw forward to overcome the upper airway obstruction caused by the posterior positioning of the tongue.Given that a proportion of children with Robin sequence will have Stickler syndrome, it is important that a child with PRS have an evaluation by an optometrist or ophthalmologist in the first year of life looking for myopia that can be seen in Stickler syndrome. Because retinal detachment that can occur in Stickler syndrome is a leading cause of blindness in children, it is very important to recognize and be thoughtful of this diagnosis.|$|E
