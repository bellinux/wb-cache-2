50|$|IP {{addressing}} {{entails the}} assignment of IP addresses and associated parameters to host interfaces. The address space is divided into subnetworks, involving the designation of network prefixes. IP routing is performed by all hosts, as well as routers, whose main function is to transport packets across network boundaries.

50|$|Border Gateway Protocol is {{an example}} of a path vector protocol. In BGP, the routing table {{maintains}} the autonomous systems that are traversed in order to reach the destination system. <b>Exterior</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocol</b> (EGP) does not use path vectors.|$|E
50|$|Supernetting {{requires}} {{the use of}} routing protocols that support Classless Inter-Domain Routing (CIDR).

50|$|The {{customer}} edge (CE) is the router at {{the customer}} premises that {{is connected to}} the provider edge of a service provider IP/MPLS network. CE peers with the Provider Edge (PE) and exchanges routes with the corresponding VRF inside the PE. The routing protocol used could be static or dynamic (an interior gateway protocol like OSPF or an <b>exterior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocol</b> like BGP).|$|E
50|$|BGP may be {{used for}} routing within an {{autonomous}} system. In this application it is referred to as Interior Border <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocol,</b> Internal BGP, or iBGP.

50|$|Convergence is an {{important}} notion {{for a set of}} routers that engage in dynamic routing. All Interior <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocols</b> rely on convergence to function properly.

40|$|In {{classical}} {{circuit switching}} networks Quality of Service {{is an essential}} aspect which influence the entire network design process, including routing consideration. Due to the efforts to introduce Quality of Service (QoS) into IP-based networks, design routing to support QoS becomes increasingly important, e. g. in such concepts like integrated service and differentiated service IP networks. In this we give {{an overview of the}} possibility to introduce QoS in existing routing schemes and give an outlook to new QoS routing protocols currently discussed in the internet community such as the IETF. First of all we give a survey of different routing algorithms used in unicast Interior <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocols</b> and <b>Exterior</b> <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocols.</b> We describe in detail (E) IGRP a proprietary CISCO routing protocol, followed by a short overview of the different aspects for QoS routing protocols in the Internet...|$|R
5000|$|It is also {{suggested}} in RFC 2439 (under [...] "Design Choices -> Stability Sensitive Suppression of Route Advertisement") that route flap damping is a feature more desirable if implemented to <b>Exterior</b> Border <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocol</b> Sessions (eBGP sessions or simply called exterior peers) {{and not on}} Interior Border <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocol</b> Sessions (iBGP sessions or simply called internal peers); With this approach when a route flaps inside an autonomous system, it is not propagated to the external ASs flapping a route to an eBGP will have a chain of flapping for the particular route throughout the backbone. This method also successfully avoids the overhead of route flap damping for iBGP sessions.|$|R

50|$|Finally, routing {{technologies}} {{were developed}} for the Internet to remove the remaining centralized routing aspects.

50|$|When BGP runs {{between two}} {{peers in the}} same {{autonomous}} system (AS), it {{is referred to as}} Internal BGP (iBGP or Interior Border <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocol).</b> When it runs between different autonomous systems, it is called External BGP (eBGP or <b>Exterior</b> Border <b>Gateway</b> <b>Protocol).</b> Routers on the boundary of one AS exchanging information with another AS are called border or edge routers or simply eBGP peers and are typically connected directly, while iBGP peers can be interconnected through other intermediate routers. Other deployment topologies are also possible, such as running eBGP peering inside a VPN tunnel, allowing two remote sites to exchange routing information in a secure and isolated manner. The main difference between iBGP and eBGP peering is in the way routes that were received from one peer are propagated to other peers. For instance, new routes learned from an eBGP peer are typically redistributed to all iBGP peers as well as all other eBGP peers (if transit mode is enabled on the router). However, if new routes are learned on an iBGP peering, then they are re-advertised only to all eBGP peers. These route-propagation rules effectively require that all iBGP peers inside an AS are interconnected in a full mesh.|$|R
40|$|Data centers {{today are}} growing {{in size and}} {{becoming}} harder to manage. It {{is more important than}} ever to concentrate on management of such large networks, and arrive at simple yet efficient designs that involve minimum manual intervention. Reducing network management costs can lead to better service availability, response times and increase return on investment. In this dissertation, we focus on three aspects of data center network management, the network fabric, policy enforcement and fault localization. There are inherent challenges due to scale in each of these areas. Firstly, simple, plug-and-play networks are known not to scale, leading network operators to often stitch complex interior and <b>exterior</b> <b>gateway</b> <b>protocols</b> to connect large data centers. Second, network isolation policies can become too huge for network hardware to handle as the number of applications multiplexed on a single data center increase. Thirdly diagnosis can become extremely hard because of the sheer number of components interacting for a service to be successful. Localizing the fault is often left to knowledgeable operators who work together in war rooms to track down and fight problems. Such an approach can be time consuming, tedious and reduce availability. To address these challenges, we propose to compose the data center management system with these three contributions : (i) PortLand : A scalable layer 2 network fabric that completely eliminates loops and broadcast storms and combines the best elements of traditional layer 2 and layer 3 network fabrics: plug-and-play, support for scale, mobility and path diversity. (ii) FasTrak : A policy enforcement system that moves network isolation rules between server software and network hardware so that performance sensitive traffic is not subject to unnecessary overheads and latency. FasTrak enables performance sensitive applications to move into multi- tenant clouds and supports their requirements. (iii) Gestalt : A fault localization algorithm, developed from first principles, that can operate in large scale networks and beats existing localization algorithms on localization accuracy or time or both. We have prototyped and evaluated each of these systems and believe that these can be easily implemented with minor modifications to data center switches and end host...|$|R
