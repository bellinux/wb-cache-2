5|$|According to the police, the {{passengers}} behaved very calmly, given the circumstances. Keč allowed several of {{the passengers}} to use their mobile telephones, allowing {{one of them to}} communicate with the police and keep Sheriff Jan Bergen updated on the situation. Anti-terror police had been called to the scene, and there were plans to storm the aircraft <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> escalated. After the incident, the police refused to say if they would have stormed the aircraft if Keč followed through his threats to depart to another airport. During the last stages of the incident, another aircraft was parked beside the MD-82, which the police confirmed played a role {{towards the end of the}} hijacking. All communication towards the central government was made to the Norwegian Ministry of Justice, and neither the prime minister of the minister of foreign affairs was ever contacted. No weapons were found on either the aircraft nor on the hijacker.|$|E
5|$|Alarmed, the American {{ambassador}} to Brazil sent a cablegram to his Department of State in September 1906, warning {{them of the}} destabilization that would occur <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> devolved into a full naval arms race. At the same time, the American government under Theodore Roosevelt tried using diplomatic means to coerce the Brazilians into canceling their ships, but the attempts were dismissed, with the Baron of Rio Branco remarking that caving to the American demands would render Brazil as powerless as suzerain Cuba. The President of Brazil, Afonso Pena, supported the naval acquisitions in {{an address to the}} National Congress of Brazil in November 1906, as in his opinion the ships were necessary to replace the antiquated and obsolete vessels of the current navy.|$|E
5|$|In the {{afternoon}} of 7 April, Trifunović again pressed Petrović to order a withdrawal from the border. Petrović accepted that this might become necessary <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> on the immediate right flank of the 7th Army deteriorated further, but the idea was opposed by the Slovene {{chief of staff of}} the headquarters of the 1st Army Group, Armijski đeneral Leon Rupnik, who suggested that Trifunović, a Serb, should personally lead night attacks to push the Germans back. At 19:30, the Yugoslav Supreme Command advised Petrović that he had approval to withdraw endangered units on the right wing of the 7th Army. Morale in the 7th Army had started to decline due to fifth column elements encouraging soldiers to stop resisting the enemy.|$|E

5|$|The Yugoslav Supreme Command ordered Petrović to use Mountain Detachment Rišnajaski {{to capture}} Fiume, across the Rječina river from Sušak, but {{the order was}} soon {{rescinded}} due to the deteriorating situation in the flanking 4th Army.

5|$|The {{following}} morning, {{at first}} light, {{spurred on by}} the example provided by 11 Platoon, reinforcements from the 2/48th came up to complete the capture of Sattelberg. Just after dawn, a heavy artillery barrage was brought down on the summit by Australian artillery {{in preparation for the}} final attack. At 8:25am patrols were sent out from 'B' Company, 2/48th Battalion, and they subsequently reported that the Japanese had abandoned the position sometime during the night. Indeed, it was later established that Miyake, who had been in command of the troops gathered around the mission and had been given permission to abandon Sattelberg <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> became untenable, had decided to withdraw from the position soon after Derrick's attack.|$|E
5|$|The Australian-led INTERFET {{intervention}} into East Timor in September 1999 {{marked the}} closest Australia's F-111s came to combat. F-111s from both No. 1 and No. 6 Squadrons were deployed to RAAF Base Tindal, Northern Territory, on 28 August {{to support the}} international forces, and remained there until 17 December 1999. This was a maximum effort for No. 82 Wing, and up to 10 F-111Cs were available at Tindal; No. 1 Squadron's commitment peaked at six aircraft and about 100 personnel. No. 75 Squadron also maintained 12 F/A-18s at its home base of Tindal to support INTERFET if needed. From 20 September, when INTERFET began to arrive in East Timor, the F-111s were maintained {{at a high level}} of readiness to conduct reconnaissance flights or air strikes <b>if</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> deteriorated. For the latter role two F-111s armed with concrete-filled bombs fitted with precision guidance kits were kept available at all times. INTERFET did not encounter significant resistance, however, and F-111 operations were limited to reconnaissance missions conducted by RF-111Cs from 5 November. Each of these sorties were made after gaining approval from the Indonesian government and normally focused on bridges and communications installations. The last RF-111C flight over East Timor took place on 9 December. War games had the F-111s achieving complete success if a strike was necessary against Indonesian military headquarters near the capital.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} mobilization, the Life Guards arrived at their {{assigned}} position near the Belgian border. Strachwitz and his platoon volunteered for a mounted, long-distance reconnaissance patrol, which would penetrate far behind Belgian lines. His orders were to gather intelligence on rail and communications connections and potentially disturb them, {{as well as}} report on the war preparations being made by their opponents. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> allowed, he was to destroy railway and telephone connections and to derail trains, causing as much havoc as possible. His patrol ran into many obstacles and they were constantly {{on the verge of}} being detected by either British or French forces. Their objective was the Paris–Limoges–Bordeaux train track. Strachwitz dispatched a messenger, who broke through to the German lines and delivered the intelligence they had gathered. The patrol blew up the signal box at the Fontainebleau railway station, and tried to force their way through to presumed German troops at the Marne near Châlons. However, the French forces were too strong and they were unable to get through. After six weeks behind the lines their rations were depleted and they had to resort to stealing or begging. Strachwitz then decided to head for Switzerland, hoping that the French–Swiss border was not as heavily protected. After a brief skirmish with French forces, one of Strachwitz's men was seriously wounded, which forced them to seek medical attention. During many weeks of outdoor living their uniforms had deteriorated, so Strachwitz took that opportunity to buy new clothes for his men. Their progress was slowed by the wounded man, and the group was caught in civilian clothes by French forces.|$|E

25|$|A growing {{critique}} of peacekeeping {{is the lack}} of engagement between the peacekeeping officials and the local populace. As Severine Autessrre outlines in a 2015 Foreign Policy article, this creates an environment where the peacekeeping officials develop plans to ‘keep’ the peace, but they are disconnected from reality, having the opposite effect on the ground. Additionally, it creates a reinforcement mechanism for the peacekeeping officials, because the officials on the ground report that their plan was successfully implemented, but, in reality, it had adverse effects. <b>If</b> <b>the</b> <b>situation</b> on the ground turns into another outbreak of violence, the local populace will be blamed.|$|E
