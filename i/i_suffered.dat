5|$|Sviatoslav enthusiastically {{agreed to}} the Byzantine proposal. In August 967 or 968, the Rus' crossed the Danube into Bulgarian territory, {{defeated}} a Bulgarian army of 30,000 men in the Battle of Silistra, and occupied most of the Dobruja. According to the Bulgarian historian Vasil Zlatarski, Sviatoslav seized 80towns in northeastern Bulgaria. They were looted and destroyed but not permanently occupied. Tsar Peter <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> an epileptic stroke when he received news of the defeat. The Rus' wintered at Pereyaslavets, while the Bulgarians retreated to the fortress of Dorostolon (Silistra). The next year, Sviatoslav left with part of his army to counter a Pecheneg attack on his capital at Kiev (incited either by the Byzantines or, according to the Russian Primary Chronicle, by the Bulgarians). At the same time, Tsar Peter sent a new embassy to Byzantium, a visit that was recorded by Liutprand of Cremona. In contrast to their previous reception, this time the Bulgarian envoys were treated with great honour. Nevertheless, Nikephoros, confident of his position, demanded harsh terms: Tsar Peter was to resign and be replaced by Boris, and the two young emperors, Basil and Constantine, were {{to be married to}} Bulgarian princesses, daughters of Boris.|$|E

His ally Suleiman the Magnificent sent a doctor, who allegedly cured the patient with yogurt. Being grateful, the French king spread around {{the information about the}} food which had cured him.|$|E

5000|$|The main {{theme of}} Free verse, as with Migjeni's prose, is misery and suffering. It is a poetry of acute social {{awareness}} and despair. Previous generations of poets had sung the beauties of the Albanian {{mountains and the}} sacred traditions of the nation, whereas Migjeni now opened {{his eyes to the}} harsh realities of life, to the appalling level of misery, disease and poverty he discovered all around him. He was a poet of despair who saw no way out, who cherished no hope that anything but death could put an end to suffering. [...] "I suffer with the child whose father cannot buy him a toy. <b>I</b> <b>suffer</b> with the young man who burns with unslaked sexual desire. <b>I</b> <b>suffer</b> with the middle-aged man drowning in the apathy of life. <b>I</b> <b>suffer</b> with the old man who trembles at the prospect of death. <b>I</b> <b>suffer</b> with the peasant struggling with the soil. <b>I</b> <b>suffer</b> with the worker crushed by iron. <b>I</b> <b>suffer</b> with the sick suffering from all the diseases of the world... <b>I</b> <b>suffer</b> with man." [...] Typical of the suffering and of the futility of human endeavour for Migjeni is Rezignata ("Resignation"), a poem in the longest cycle of the collection, Kangët e mjerimit ("Songs of poverty"). Here the poet paints a grim portrait of our earthly existence: sombre nights, tears, smoke, thorns and mud. Rarely does {{a breath of fresh air}} or a vision of nature seep through the gloom. When nature does occur in the verse of Migjeni, then of course it is autumn.|$|R

25|$|The Union {{occupied}} {{several key}} positions along the North Carolina coast, however {{the interior was}} controlled by Confederate forces which frequently threatened or besieged Union strongholds. The 3rd Massachusetts took part in several patrols and expeditions aimed at disrupting Confederate supply lines in the interior and dislodging Confederate forces encroaching on Union positions. In November, Company I of the regiment was detached and shipped to Plymouth, North Carolina where they served garrison duty apart from the regiment for five months. Confederates attacked the Plymouth on December 10, 1862 and Company <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> the first battle casualties of the 3rd Massachusetts--two killed, several wounded and 14 prisoners.|$|E
25|$|At {{the start}} of the summer hard court season Radwańska pulled out of the Bank of the West Classic, due to an injured right hand. She caught an injury to her right hand during the {{marathon}} third set in the fourth round of the Wimbledon Championships against Cibulkova. “Unfortunately the right hand injury <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> at Wimbledon is not 100 percent (fine) and my medical team has advised me to rest,” said Radwańska. She, however, was able to get back in shape before Rogers Cup in Montreal. At Rogers Cup, she defeated Monica Niculescu in straight sets before losing to Anastasia Pavlyuchenkova in the third round.|$|E
25|$|The Tudor <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> from {{a number}} of {{stability}} problems, which included longitudinal and directional instability. The problem was handed over to the Royal Aircraft Establishment at RAE Farnborough, where an extensive programme of testing was carried out, the test pilot being Eric Brown. Following the RAE's recommendations, a larger tailplane was fitted, and the original finely curved fin and rudder were replaced by larger vertical surfaces. BOAC added to the delays by requesting more than 340 modifications, and finally rejected the Tudor I on 11 April 1947, considering it incapable of North Atlantic operations. It had been intended that 12 Tudors would be built in Australia for military transport, but this plan was abandoned.|$|E

25|$|During {{the reign}} of Emperor Peter I, Bulgaria prospered in a {{long-lasting}} peace with Byzantium. This was secured by the marriage of Peter with the Byzantine princess Maria Lakapina, granddaughter of Byzantine Emperor Romanos I Lekapenos. However, after Maria's death in 963, the truce had been shaken {{and it was at}} this time or later that Peter I sent his sons Boris and Roman to Constantinople as honorary hostages, to honor the new terms of the peace treaty. During these years the Byzantines and Bulgarians had entangled themselves in a war with Kievan Rus' Prince Sviatoslav, who invaded Bulgaria several times. After a defeat from Sviatoslav, Peter <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> a stroke and abdicated his throne in 969 (he died the next year). Boris was allowed back to Bulgaria to take his father's throne, restore order and oppose Sviatoslav, but had little success. This was allegedly used by Nicholas and his sons, who were contemplating a revolt in 969.|$|E
25|$|And as {{they did}} still not obtain {{anything}} from me, to the implication of my neighbor, Master Hans took water (during the entire time a cloth had lain on my face), and holding my nose shut with one hand, began to pour water on my abdomen and thence all over my breast, and into my mouth; even as one should drink when he is very thirsty. I think that the can from which he poured out – the water held about three pints. And when I {{was at the end}} of my breath, and wanted to fetch such, I drew the water all into my body, whereupon <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> such distress, that it would be impossible for me to relate or describe it; but the Lord be forever praised: He kept my lips. And when they could still not obtain anything from me, they caused the cord which was on my thigh to be loosed and applied to a fresh place, and wound it much tighter than before, so that I thought he would kill me, and began to shake and tremble greatly. He then proceeded to pour water into me again, so that I think he emptied four such cans, and my body became so full of it, that twice it came out again at the throat. And thus I became so weak. that I fainted; for, when I recovered from my swoon, I found myself alone with Master Hans and Daniel de Keyser. And Master Hans was so busily engaged in loosing all my cords, that it seemed to me that they were concerned over me. But the Lord in a large degree took away my pain every time; whenever it became so severe that I thought it was impossible to bear it, my members became as dead. Eternal praise, thanks, honor, and glory be to the Lord; for when it was over I thought that, by the help of the Lord, I had fought a good fight.|$|E

500|$|Walpole {{was sent}} to England, where {{according}} to his biographer Rupert Hart-Davis {{the next ten years}} were the unhappiest time of Walpole's life. He first attended a preparatory school in Truro. Though he missed his family and felt lonely he was reasonably happy, but he moved to Sir William Borlase's Grammar School in Marlow in 1895, where he was bullied, frightened and miserable. He later said, [...] "The food was inadequate, the morality was 'twisted', and Terror – sheer, stark unblinking Terror – stared down every one of its passages... The excessive desire to be loved that has always played so enormous a part in my life was bred largely, I think, from the neglect <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> there".|$|E

Charles was separated from spectators by large ranks of soldiers, and his last speech reached only those with him on the scaffold. He blamed his fate on his failure to prevent the execution of his loyal servant Strafford: [...] "An unjust sentence that <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> to take effect, is punished now by an unjust sentence on me." [...] He declared that he had desired the liberty and freedom of the people as much as any, [...] "but I must tell you that their liberty and freedom consists in having government... It is not their having a share in the government; that is nothing appertaining unto them. A subject and a sovereign are clean different things."

At Baiao he is astonished to be shown a young man's books including Virgil, Terence, Cicero and Livy: [...] "an unexpected sight, a classical library in a mud-plastered and palm-thatched hut {{on the banks of}} the Tocantins". Their host kills an ox in their honour, but Bates is kept awake by swarms of rats and cockroaches. They see the hyacinthine macaw which can crush hard palm nuts with its beak, and two species of freshwater dolphin, one new to science. Bates visits Cameta; Wallace goes to explore the Guama and Capim rivers. The large bird-eating spider (Mygalomorphae) has urticating hairs: Bates handles the first specimen [...] "incautiously, and <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> terribly for three days".

500|$|Lody {{began an}} {{apprenticeship}} at {{a grocery store}} in Halle in 1891, before moving to Hamburg two years later to join {{the crew of the}} sailing ship Sirius as a cabin boy. He studied at the maritime academy in Geestemünde, qualifying as a helmsman, and immediately afterwards served with the Imperial German Navy for a year between 1900 and 1901. Subsequently joining the First Naval Reserve, he enlisted as an officer on German merchant ships. In 1904 he returned to Geestemünde, where he successfully obtained a captain's licence. He fell seriously ill with what he later said was a stomach abscess, [...] "caused from a very badly cured typhoid attack of fever from which <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> in Italy on account of the bad water at Genoa." [...] An operation was required, which weakened his left arm and his eyesight.

Jinnah believed public knowledge of his lung ailments would hurt him politically. In a 1938 letter, he wrote to a supporter that [...] "you must have read in the papers how during my tours... <b>I</b> <b>suffered,</b> which was not because there was anything wrong with me, but the irregularities [...] and over-strain told upon my health". Many years later, Mountbatten stated that if he had known Jinnah was so physically ill, he would have stalled, hoping Jinnah's death would avert partition. [...] Fatima Jinnah later wrote, [...] "even in his hour of triumph, the Quaid-e-Azam was gravely ill... He worked in a frenzy to consolidate Pakistan.

500|$|When Madonna {{finally decided}} {{to go on the}} tour, time was short and she had to prepare the show within three months. Auditioning for the dancers started around March 2001. Jamie King was signed up as the {{creative}} director and the choreographer of the show. King {{said in an interview that}} the tour [...] "was so hectic that <b>I</b> <b>suffered</b> from depressions and fell considerably ill." [...] Rehearsals continued for thirteen hours a day, five days a week, with more and more dancers joining for the show. In the end, ten dancers and two backup singers were used. Madonna had her guitarist Monte Pittman teach her to play the instrument, and she played both acoustic and electric guitar live in the show. French house music expert Stuart Price, who had worked with Madonna on remixes of her album Music, was signed as bassist and keyboards player. Clair Brothers Audio support was roped in for providing a mixture of high-tech techno sound and fusion of acoustic and trance. Madonna clarified: [...] "I don't see the point of doing a show unless you offer something that is going to mind-boggle the senses. It's not enough to get on stage and sing a song. It's all about theatre and drama and surprises and suspenses." ...|$|E

[...] HitFix gave a positive review saying that, [...] "season 7 overall {{has been one of}} the show's strongest ever."

[...] Speaking of season eight, Entertainment Weekly Mandi Bierly called it a [...] "so-so season", and Lesley Goldberg of The Hollywood Reporter called it [...] "emotional".
