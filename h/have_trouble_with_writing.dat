5000|$|Peart {{went through}} tapes {{to the five}} new songs in a Miami hotel room in March, {{getting ready for the}} warm-up tour gig in Lakeland, Florida. At this point, the band met up with {{engineer}} James [...] "Jimbo" [...] Barton, recommended by producer Peter Collins. Later at Elora, the songs whose lyrics Peart was formerly struggling with, [...] "Territories" [...] and [...] "Manhattan Project", began to come together. Peart was also working on lyrics to a ballad called [...] "Emotion Detector", which seemed to work perfectly with the music they were jamming on at the time. The music to [...] "Territories" [...] was also arranged, and a tape of seven songs was created. They <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>writing</b> the music to [...] "Manhattan Project", but Collins contributed ideas to this and other songs.|$|R

40|$|Many {{students}} at American universities <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> technical <b>writing.</b> To help students over this trouble, we often use inefficient methods. These methods, like {{other aspects of}} graduate education, sometimes remind me of medieval apprenticeships. For example, I have known smart, capable teachers who were reduced to “teaching a student to write ” by taking that student’s first paper and rewriting it from start to finish. This booklet describes better methods. Instead of spending most of my “student time ” working on writing—teaching the same material to seniors, graduate students, and postdocs—I now prefer to teach writing to a group that meets weekly. Teaching a group uses my time more effectively, and working in a group shows students {{that they are not}} alone in their difficulties. The problems they have are problems that everyone has, and they see these problems even in published papers. But we do not emphasize problems; instead we emphasize useful principles and practices that students can learn to apply to their own manuscripts. • I emphasize principles that can be applied successfully by a beginning writer. Especially for students in science and engineering, a principle is easily applicable whe...|$|R
5000|$|In {{his review}} on the Consequence of Sound website, Mike Madden gave the album {{three and a}} half out of five stars, writing that Another Self Portrait is [...] "highlighted by songs weve heard before but {{presented}} here in different versions, such as the cozy lament I Threw It All Away". Despite some [...] "bottom-of-the-barrel" [...] material, Madden noted the [...] "pleasing discoveries" [...] presented on the album: I contemplated every move, or at least I tried, Dylan sings on Went to See the Gypsy. Elsewhere, Another Self Portrait indicates that while he <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> his <b>writing</b> mechanics around this time, it wasnt for lack of trying. Sign on the Window is home to orchestral arrangements that could have been on George Harrisons All Things Must Pass, while Abbey Road dynamics power the second alternate version of Time Passes Slowly. These, as well as the rockabilly of Working on a Guru and the Nashville classicism of Tattle ODay, are moderate successes, but they reveal that Dylan did in fact have the motivation to flesh out new directions for himself during these years. Lets be grateful that this set exists, if only because it begins to clears up a mythical period of the now 72-year-old Dylan’s frequently inscrutable oeuvre.|$|R
40|$|A reading {{disability}} is {{one form}} of learning difficulty, caused by neurological factors. Young children with reading disabilities are recognized as <b>having</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> spelling, reading, <b>writing,</b> and other academic activities. Even {{though there is no}} cure for reading disabilities so far, there are many things {{we can do to help}} these children. For young children, the best way to help them learn is taking advantage of all their senses. Multimedia has been widely used in education today. Designers use various formats of digital multimedia to enhance user’s experience in learning. It provides an excellent opportunity to help children with reading disabilities. The mission of this project is using motion graphics and interaction design to stimulate their motivation to learn how to read. The final format of the project is an interactive game on the web. It helps children to learn about letters, phonics, words and how they can be combined into meaningful text. It could be attractive for children by calling on their different senses as they watch and hear. Interaction design may help children with reading disabilities to remember the information by encouraging them to participate in the learning process actively. Motion graphics is a good way to visualize some complex and abstract text. Overall, the project is focusing on creating a tool that may be helpful, as well as enjoyable, for children with reading disabilities...|$|R
5000|$|Information {{comes out}} of the brain either through words, that is, {{language}} output, or through muscle activity, such as gesturing, writing or drawing. Difficulties with language output can create problems with spoken language. Such difficulties include answering a question on demand, in which one must retrieve information from storage, organize our thoughts, and put the thoughts into words before we speak. It can also cause <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> <b>written</b> language for the same reasons. Difficulties with motor abilities can cause problems with gross and fine motor skills. People with gross motor difficulties may be clumsy, that is, they may be prone to stumbling, falling, or bumping into things. They may also <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> running, climbing, or learning to ride a bicycle. People with fine motor difficulties may <b>have</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> handwriting, buttoning shirts, or tying shoelaces.|$|R

50|$|Award-winning {{director}} Cathy Garcia-Molina {{entered the}} Big Brother House on Day 108 {{to help the}} housemates on their weekly task. With her help, they are tasked to create a short movie as their weekly task. She gave them their script and also tasked them to know their character. She came back at the Big Brother House the next day, {{only to find out}} that the housemates did not do their assignment. Instead they only memorized their script. This led to Direk Cathy's walk-out from the house. On Day 110, Big Brother called Jane and Daniel in the confession room to tell them that Direk Cathy still didn't want to come back until she sees that they are worth working for. Because of that, the housemates practiced their lines all day. The next morning, Direk Cathy came back at the Big Brother House, and the housemates apologized to her for not making their homework. After that, they started to shoot for their weekly task. All housemates <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> shooting. Daniel <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> pronouncing Tagalog words and Loisa <b>had</b> <b>trouble</b> <b>with</b> her expressions and voice.
