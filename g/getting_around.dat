5|$|As Stone & Webster {{began work}} on the {{production}} facilities, {{it became clear that}} building the township as well would be beyond its capacity. The Army therefore engaged the architectural and engineering firm Skidmore, Owings & Merrill to design and build the township. The John B. Pierce Foundation were brought in as a consultant. In turn, Skidmore, Owings & Merrill brought in numerous subcontractors. This first phase of construction became known as the East Town. It included some 3,000 family dwellings, an administrative center, three shopping centers, three grade schools for 500 children each and a high school for 500, recreation buildings, men's and women's dormitories, cafeterias, a medical services building and a 50-bed hospital. The emphasis was on speed of construction and <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> wartime shortages of materials. Where possible, fiberboard and gypsum board were used instead of wood, and foundations were made from concrete blocks rather than poured concrete. The work was completed in early 1944.|$|E

25|$|Once in town, {{options for}} <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> include car rental, the local bus system (Agglobus), or on foot. The {{pedestrian}} city centre (centre ville) is paved in cobblestone streets, which {{are lined with}} buildings that are hundreds of years old.|$|E

25|$|Although the BMA {{has created}} thirty signed bicycle routes along several roads totalling , cycling is still largely impractical, {{especially}} in the city centre.

25|$|The first fully {{terrestrial}} vertebrates were amniotes — {{their eggs}} had internal membranes {{that allowed the}} developing embryo to breathe but kept water in. This allowed amniotes to lay eggs on dry land, while amphibians generally need to lay their eggs in water (a few amphibians, such as the Surinam toad, have evolved other ways of <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> this limitation). The first amniotes apparently arose in the middle Carboniferous from the ancestral reptiliomorphs.|$|E
25|$|The {{only way}} of <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> obtaining the {{permission}} of the wife or of the wives is if she or if they are unsound, if they have died, if they have completely and finally renounced the world, and if they have ceased to be a Hindu.

METRA Transit System operates bus service in downtown, which connects riders to other places in the city. The primary way of <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> downtown for many people is by car. Downtown Columbus is accessible from Interstate 185 by J. R. Allen Parkway, which allows direct travel into the area via 2nd Avenue. Downtown is also served by two arterial roads, Veterans Parkway (north–south) and Victory Drive (east–west).|$|E

25|$|A dispute ensued and {{all sorts}} of {{agreements}} and contractual arrangements were argued over. It seems that WG was at first rude and insulting, then tried to brazen it out before offering a guarded apology and eventually <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> to his favourite topic: money. Midwinter apparently did quite well out of it all despite being anything but an innocent party. The Aussies got some satisfaction when they beat Middlesex by 98 runs without Midwinter while Gloucestershire, with Midwinter, lost by 16 runs to Surrey. But the real revenge came later.|$|E
25|$|South Beach, {{along with}} a handful of other neighborhoods in Greater Miami (such as Downtown and Brickell), is one of the areas where a car-free {{lifestyle}} is commonplace. Many South Beach residents get around by foot, bicycle, motorcycle, bus or by taxi, as the neighborhood is very urban, and pedestrian-friendly. Automobile congestion in the area is frequent, so <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> in South Beach by car can often prove more difficult than simply walking. Recently, Miami Beach has begun bicycle initiaves promoting citywide bike parking and bike lanes, that have made bicycling much more popular for residents and tourists. The Venetian Causeway for example, is a popular bicycle commuter route that connects South Beach to Downtown.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, {{the first}} bike lane {{in the city}} was added to Orange Street, {{connecting}} East Rock Park and the East Rock neighborhood to downtown. Since then, bike lanes have also been added to sections of Howard Ave, Elm St, Dixwell Avenue, Water Street, Clinton Avenue and State Street. The city has created recommended bike routes for <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> New Haven, including use of the Canal Trail and the Orange Street lane. As {{of the end of}} 2012, bicycle lanes have also been added in both directions on Dixwell Avenue along most of the street from downtown to the Hamden town line, as well as along Howard Avenue from Yale New Haven Hospital to City Point.|$|E

25|$|Tori Lord – Tori {{emerged in}} 1995, {{approximately}} 19 years old, after Dorian revealed {{the truth of}} Victor's abuse to Viki. It was established that Tori was the alter who murdered Victor Lord in 1976. (It would later be revealed that Victor survived and did not die until 2003. However Dorian has planted a seed of doubt regarding that notion, suggesting {{that the man who}} re-emerged as Victor in 2003 was a fraud.) Although her declared mission was to force Viki to face the truth, she wreaked much destruction before <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> to that. Tori started undermining The Banner by feeding stories and information to rival newspaper editor Todd Manning, and she torched Llanfair, nearly killing Jessica in the blaze.|$|E
25|$|Bicycles and {{tricycles}} {{are popular}} for <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> {{on the dry}} lake. Mountain bikes are generally preferred over road bikes for riding on the dried silt, which is normally hard but becomes loose with traffic. Participants often decorate their bikes to make them unique. Since lighting on the bikes is critically important for safety at night, many participants incorporate the lighting into their decorations, using electroluminescent wire (a thin, flexible tube that glows with a neon-like effect when energized with electricity) to create intricate patterns over {{the frame of the}} bike. Every night during Burning Man, thousands of bikes and art cars drive around, creating a visual display similar to Las Vegas at night, except that the lights are mobile.|$|E
25|$|In {{response}} to these tactics, the 1920 version of the California Alien Land Law included more stringent rules designed {{to put a stop}} to such circumvention. Among other changes, it introduced a provision that would prove to be crucial in the Oyama case – namely, it stated that if a person purchased land in another person’s name, it would be presumed that this was done with intent to bypass the Alien Land Law. This was a significant shift in the rules regarding burden of proof in state escheat cases involving land. Whereas before the State would have to prove its case, this was no longer the situation – it was now incumbent upon the defendant to prove that the purchased land was a bona fide gift rather than an attempt at <b>getting</b> <b>around</b> the land ownership restrictions.|$|E
