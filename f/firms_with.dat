5|$|Before {{construction}} could begin, the Navy {{found itself}} {{in the midst of}} political situation because the Hungarian government demanded that {{a substantial portion of the}} submarine contracts be allocated to Hungarian firms. After intricate negotiations, the order was split into two orders of two submarines each, with U-20 and U-21 built at the Pola Navy Yard, and U-22 and U-23 built at the Hungarian UBAG yard at Fiume. The subcontracts were also divided between Hungarian and Austrian <b>firms,</b> <b>with</b> about two-thirds going to Hungarian companies and one-third to Austrian companies. This allocation of contracts, while politically expedient, exacerbated technical problems that resulted in numerous modifications and delays.|$|E

5|$|Germany and the Netherlands were {{eventually}} {{able to reach}} an agreement where Germany would release plans and drawings based upon their ideas for a battlecruiser, in return for a guarantee that all needed equipment would be ordered from German <b>firms.</b> <b>With</b> their assistance (mainly through NV Ingenieurskantoor voor Scheepsbouw), a rough design was formulated by February 1940. A visit to Italy prompted a rethink of the internal layout, which led to a set of drawings dated 19 April 1940. This is the last known design produced prior to Germany's invasion and occupation of the Netherlands. Final plans for the ships were never completed, and the ships were never constructed.|$|E

5|$|Although members {{contribute}} {{capital to}} the IBRD, the Bank acquires funds primarily by borrowing on international capital markets by issuing bonds. The Bank raised $29 billion USD worth of capital in 2011 from bonds issued in 26 different currencies. The IBRD {{has enjoyed a}} triple-A credit rating since 1959, which allows it to borrow capital at favorable rates. It offers benchmark and global benchmark bonds, bonds denominated in non-hard currencies, structured notes with custom-tailored yields and currencies, discount notes in U.S. dollars and eurodollars. In 2011, the IBRD sought an additional $86 billion USD (of which $5.1 billion would be paid-in capital) {{as part of a}} general capital increase to increase its lending capacity to middle-income countries. The IBRD expressed in February 2012 its intent to sell kangaroo bonds (bonds denominated in Australian dollars issued by external <b>firms)</b> <b>with</b> maturities lasting until 2017 and 2022.|$|E
5|$|Early {{on in the}} force's history, most of its {{equipment}} and weapons had to be imported from abroad, {{due to the lack}} of indigenous Canadian industry. Its early saddlery and wagons were imported from the United States, although the police's uniforms were made locally. After 1887, political pressure grew to use Canadian suppliers whenever possible. Supplies of food and similar goods were initially bought from the major trading companies in the west, such as the Hudson's Bay Company, but this gradually changed once more of the territories were settled and goods could be purchased from smaller, local <b>firms,</b> <b>with</b> the police becoming an important source of business. Equipment and supplies had to be bought from companies that supported the government of the day, and after 1896 a formal list of politically approved suppliers was kept by the comptroller's office. All of the police's guns had to be imported, {{due to the lack of}} indigenous manufacturers, and by 1890s the force was still buying most of its ammunition from abroad, as Canadian-manufactured cartridges remained substandard.|$|E

25|$|Overall, in 2007, 33% of {{employers}} gave employees the day off, a 2% {{increase over the}} previous year.

40|$|We analyze a duopoly where capacity-constrained firms {{offer an}} {{established}} product {{and have the}} option to offer an additional new and differentiated product. We show that the <b>firm</b> <b>with</b> the smaller capacity on the established market has a higher incentive to innovate and reaches a larger market share on the market for the new product. An increase in capacity of the larger firm can prevent its competitor from innovating, whereas an increase in capacity of the smaller firm cannot prevent innovation of its larger competitor. In equilibrium the <b>firm</b> <b>with</b> smaller capacity on the established market might outperform the larger <b>firm</b> <b>with</b> respect to total payoffs...|$|R
