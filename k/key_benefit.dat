5|$|Renewable energy {{continued}} its {{rapid growth in}} 2015, providing multiple benefits. There was a new record set for installed wind and photovoltaic capacity (64GW and 57GW) and a new high of US$329 Billion for global renewables investment. A <b>key</b> <b>benefit</b> that this investment growth brings is a growth in jobs. The top countries for investment in recent years were China, Germany, Spain, the United States, Italy, and Brazil. Renewable energy companies include BrightSource Energy, First Solar, Gamesa, GE Energy, Goldwind, Sinovel, Targray, Trina Solar, Vestas, and Yingli.|$|E

25|$|From the issuer's perspective, the <b>key</b> <b>benefit</b> {{of raising}} money by selling {{convertible}} bonds is a reduced cash interest payment. The advantage for companies of issuing convertible bonds is that, if the bonds are converted to stocks, companies' debt vanishes. However, {{in exchange for}} the benefit of reduced interest payments, the value of shareholder's equity is reduced due to the stock dilution expected when bondholders convert their bonds into new shares.|$|E
25|$|Intermodal freight {{transport}} involves the transportation of freight in an intermodal container or vehicle, using multiple modes of transportation (e.g.,rail, ship, and truck), without any {{handling of the}} freight itself when changing modes. The method reduces cargo handling, and so improves security, reduces damage and loss, and allows freight to be transported faster. Reduced costs over road trucking is the <b>key</b> <b>benefit</b> for inter-continental use. This may be offset by reduced timings for road transport over shorter distances.|$|E
25|$|There {{is also a}} {{link between}} the hopping action and breathing: as the feet leave the ground, air is {{expelled}} from the lungs; bringing the feet forward ready for landing refills the lungs, providing further energy efficiency. Studies of kangaroos and wallabies have demonstrated, beyond the minimum energy expenditure required to hop at all, increased speed requires very little extra effort (much less than the same speed increase in, say, a horse, dog or human), and the extra energy is required to carry extra weight. For kangaroos, the <b>key</b> <b>benefit</b> of hopping is not speed to escape predators—the top speed of a kangaroo is no higher than that of a similarly sized quadruped, and the Australian native predators are in any case less fearsome than those of other countries—but economy: in an infertile country with highly variable weather patterns, the ability of a kangaroo to travel long distances at moderately high speed in search of food sources is crucial to survival.|$|E

25|$|Deep {{water in}} lakes {{and the ocean}} can provide {{pressure}} without requiring high-pressure vessels or drilling into salt caverns or aquifers. The air goes into inexpensive, flexible containers such as plastic bags below in deep lakes or off sea coasts with steep drop-offs. Obstacles include {{the limited number of}} suitable locations and the need for high-pressure pipelines between the surface and the containers. Since the containers would be very inexpensive, the need for great pressure (and great depth) may not be as important. A <b>key</b> <b>benefit</b> of systems built on this concept is that charge and discharge pressures are a constant function of depth. Carnot inefficiencies can thereby be reduced in the power plant. Carnot efficiency can be increased by using multiple charge and discharge stages and using inexpensive heat sources and sinks such as cold water from rivers or hot water from solar ponds. Ideally, the system must be very clever—for example, by cooling air before pumping on summer days. It must be engineered to avoid inefficiency, such as wasteful pressure changes caused by inadequate piping diameter.|$|E
25|$|A <b>key</b> <b>benefit</b> that professionalism {{brought to}} rugby union {{as a whole}} was the {{elimination}} of the constant defection of union players who were attracted to the money of rugby league. The rugby union authorities of the time also hoped that as players could now play in either code, in the long term most of the sponsorship and interest would gravitate away from league to the more international game of union. However, rugby union has not managed to lure away {{more than a handful of}} elite players from rugby league, as the two codes have become quite different over the decades of separation in both culture and in aspects of play. The preferred body type and skill sets of players differ, especially in the play of the forwards. With access to players of different types, some more suited to one code and some to the other, some English rugby union clubs have even formed partnerships with a rugby league club which plays in the premier rugby league competitions – the most notable example being Harlequins with London Broncos (formerly Harlequins Rugby League), and between Wigan Warriors and Saracens.|$|E
500|$|Flying {{schools are}} {{commercial}} businesses {{engaged in the}} training of pilots, both for recreational purposes and for those intending to fly professionally. They make widespread use of fixed-wing light aircraft associated with traditional GA, not only for flying lessons but also as club aircraft rented out to qualified pilots for recreational flights. School-owned aircraft account for {{a significant amount of}} GA activity, both in terms of hours flown and aircraft movements. The pilot training element is regarded by the GA community as a <b>key</b> <b>benefit</b> that is critical to the supply of pilots for the airline industry. It is claimed by the General Aviation Awareness Council that 60–70 per cent of professional pilots have self-financed their flight training at GA schools, and one UK airline operator has stated that the industry must rely on 70–80 per cent of new pilots coming from the GA sector. The CAA estimates that between 1996 and 2006 the number of new professional pilots following the unsponsored training route rose from 48 per cent to 59 per cent. The counter argument to this claim is that pilots can be trained outside of the UK, and that the airline industry is not therefore dependent on a healthy GA sector in the UK for its supply of pilots. The CAA concludes that a severe reduction in GA would give [...] "some merit to the argument that pilot recruitment would be threatened", but that the data on flying hours [...] "does not support such a gloomy outlook." [...] Of course, reliance on other countries for pilot training means that the UK foregoes the economic benefit of the training activity.|$|E

2500|$|In {{countries}} that permit {{the making of}} an administration order, the floating charge had another <b>key</b> <b>benefit.</b> [...] The holder of a floating charge could appoint an administrative receiver and block {{the appointment of a}} court-appointed administrator, and thus retain control of the distribution of the assets of the company. [...] Practice became such that companies were asked to give [...] "lightweight" [...] floating charges to secured lenders which had no collateral value purely to allow the holders to block administration orders, an approach that was approved by the courts in Re Croftbell Ltd [...] BCC 781. [...] In the United Kingdom the law has now been changed by statute, but the power to block appointments of administrators has been retained in many other common law jurisdictions.|$|E
