500|$|There {{are certain}} {{language}} features and configuration parameters (primarily the default values for such runtime settings) that make PHP applications prone to security issues. [...] Among these, magic_quotes_gpc and register_globals configuration directives {{are the best}} known; the latter made any URL parameters become PHP variables, opening a path for serious security vulnerabilities by allowing an attacker to set the value of any uninitialized <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> and interfere with the execution of a PHP script. [...] Support for [...] "magic quotes" [...] and [...] "register globals" [...] has been deprecated as of PHP 5.3.0, and removed as of PHP 5.4.0.|$|E
2500|$|Alternative {{approaches}} to exception handling in software are error checking, which maintains normal program flow with later explicit checks for contingencies reported using special return values or some auxiliary <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> such as C's [...] or floating point status flags; or input validation to preemptively filter exceptional cases.|$|E
50|$|The logical {{database}} of a GT.M process consists {{of one or}} more <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> name spaces, each consisting of unlimited number of global variables. For each <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> name space, a global directory maps global variables to the database files where they actually reside. An unlimited number of global variables can fit within one database file; a <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> must fit in one database file.|$|E
50|$|When {{programming}} AmigaDOS scripts, {{one must}} {{keep in mind}} that <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> are system-wide. All script-internal variables shall be set using local variables, or one risks conflicts over <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> between scripts. Also, <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> require filesystem access, which typically makes them slower to access than local variables.|$|R
5000|$|In D version 2, all {{static and}} <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> are thread-local by default and are {{declared}} with syntax similar to [...] "normal" [...] <b>global</b> and static <b>variables</b> in other languages. <b>Global</b> <b>variables</b> must be explicitly requested using the shared keyword: ...|$|R

50|$|A {{database}} file consists {{of up to}} 224M (276,168,704) database blocks. A database block is a multiple of 512 bytes, with a maximum size of 65,024 bytes. Commonly used block sizes are 4KB, 8KB and 16KB - so, with an 8KB block size, an individual <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> can grow to 1,792GB. A <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> node (<b>global</b> <b>variable,</b> subscripts plus value) must fit in one database block and each block has a 16 byte overhead. So, the largest node that will fit in a database with a 4KB block size is 4,080 bytes. A key (<b>global</b> <b>variable</b> plus subscripts) can be up to 255 bytes.|$|E

5000|$|TLS {{is used in}} {{some places}} where ordinary, {{single-threaded}} programs would use global variables, but where this would be inappropriate in multithreaded cases. An example of such situations is where functions use a <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> to set an error condition (for example the <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> [...] used by many functions of the C library). If [...] were a <b>global</b> <b>variable,</b> a call of a system function on one thread may overwrite the value previously set by a call of a system function on a different thread, possibly before following code on that different thread could check for the error condition. The solution is to have [...] be a variable {{that looks like it}} is global, but in fact exists once per threadâ€”i.e., it lives in thread-local storage. A second use case would be multiple threads accumulating information into a <b>global</b> <b>variable.</b> To avoid a race condition, every access to this <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> would have to be protected by a mutex. Alternatively, each thread might accumulate into a thread-local variable (that, by definition, cannot be read from or written to from other threads, implying {{that there can be no}} race conditions). Threads then only have to synchronise a final accumulation from their own thread-local variable into a single, truly <b>global</b> <b>variable.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{one method}} for identifying <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> in Ada procedures and adding {{them to the}} parameter list of appropriate procedures. <b>Global</b> <b>variables,</b> ones that are visible to the entire program, are considered harmful to the maintainability of software systems because of the side effects that can result. A tool has been developed based on the Ada Semantic Interface Specification (ASIS) {{that can be used}} to identify <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> and re-engineer Ada procedures. By adding <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> to the parameter lists of appropriate procedures, the variables can be removed from the globally visible data space and introduced into the local declaration space...|$|R
50|$|There {{are both}} <b>global</b> and local <b>variables,</b> {{and they are}} {{referred}} to with a dollar sign {{in front of the}} variable name, for example $myvar. <b>Global</b> <b>variables</b> are available system-wide; local variables are only valid in the current shell. In case of name collision, local variables have precedence over <b>global</b> <b>variables.</b> <b>Global</b> <b>variables</b> can be set using the command SetEnv, while local variables can be set using the command Set. There are also the commands GetEnv and Get {{that can be used to}} print out <b>global</b> and local <b>variables.</b>|$|R

50|$|The {{implementation}} {{is simple}} and efficient. Every function is tagged with a unique function ID. When the function is called, the function ID is saved in a <b>global</b> <b>variable.</b> The function is only executed if the function ID in the <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> and the ID of the function match. If the IDs do not match, an instruction pointer error has occurred, and specific corrective actions can be taken. A sample implementation of token passing using a <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> programmed in C is stated in the following source listing.|$|E

50|$|The use {{of global}} {{variables}} makes software harder {{to read and}} understand. Since any code anywhere in the program can change {{the value of the}} variable at any time, understanding the use of the variable may entail understanding {{a large portion of the}} program. Global variables make separating code into reusable libraries more difficult. They can lead to problems of naming because a <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> defined in one file may conflict with the same name used for a <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> in another file (thus causing linking to fail). A local variable of the same name can shield the <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> from access, again leading to harder-to-understand code. The setting of a <b>global</b> <b>variable</b> can create side effects that are hard to locate and predict. The use of global variables makes it more difficult to isolate units of code for purposes of unit testing; thus they can directly contribute to lowering the quality of the code.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. The paper {{shows how}} to give a direct {{discrete}} formulation of the wave equation starting directly from physical laws, i. e. without passing through differential formulation. Using <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> instead of scalar and vector field functions, a close link between <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> and spatial and temporal elements immediately appears. A preliminary classification of physical variables into three classes, configuration, source and energy variables {{and the use of}} two cell complexes, one dual of the other, gives an unambiguous association of <b>global</b> <b>variables</b> to the spatial and temporal elements of the two complexes. Thus one arrives at a discrete formulation of dâ€™Alembert equation on a unstructured mesh. ...|$|R
