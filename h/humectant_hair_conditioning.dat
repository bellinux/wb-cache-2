50|$|The topical {{substantivity}} and water-resistance of hydrolyzed jojoba esters {{make them}} {{well suited to}} hold other substances {{on the surface of}} the skin or hair. Examples are: sunscreens and UV filters, pigments (for decorative cosmetics), insect repellents, quaternium <b>hair</b> <b>conditioning</b> agents, fragrance, and botanical extracts. Hydrolyzed jojoba esters can extend the moisturizing properties of traditional emulsions, and work as a refatting agent in astringents and toners. The high pH of Hydrolyzed jojoba esters make them suitable as a gel neutralizer to thicken carbomer gels. The most common applications are sunscreens, fragranced lotions, and <b>hair</b> <b>conditioning</b> agents.|$|R

40|$|Direct and {{indirect}} releases of {{large quantities of}} surfactants to the environment may result in serious health and environmental problems. Therefore, surfactants should be removed from water before water is released to the environment. Using powdered activated Corn cobs as adsorbent may be an effective technique to remove surfactants. In this study, the removal of surfactants by adsorbent was investigated and the influences of the operating parameters on the effectiveness on adsorption rate were studied. Cetyl trimethyl ammonium bromide (CTAB) has been widely used in synthesis of gold nanoparticles (e. g., spheres, rods, bipyramids), mesoporous silica nanoparticles (e. g., MCM- 41), and <b>hair</b> <b>conditioning</b> products. The present research work is to investigate the optimized conditions for removal of cationic surfactant from domestic waste water using activated Corn cob powder. The initial concentration of cationic surfactant in domestic waste water is 426 ppm. The optimum conditions for removal of cationic surfactants were Time of 90 min, Adsorbent dosage of 1 %(W/V), pH- 7 and at 30 ℃ temperature obtained.

40|$|Estimating {{building}} {{energy consumption}} {{is difficult because}} it deals with complex interactions among uncertain weather conditions, occupant behaviors, and building characteristics. To facilitate estimation, this study employs a benchmarking methodology to obtain energy baseline for sample buildings. Utilizing a scientific simulation tool, this study attempts to develop energy consumption baselines of two typical concrete residences in Taiwan, and subsequently allows a simplified energy consumption prediction process at an early design stage of building development. Using weather data of three metropolitan cities as testbeds, annual energy consumption of two types of modern residences are determined {{through a series of}} simulation sessions with different building settings. The impacts of key building characteristics, including building insulation, air tightness, orientation, location, and residence type, are carefully investigated. Sample utility bills are then collected to validate the simulated results, resulting in three adjustment parameters for normalization, including ‘number of residents’, ‘total floor area’, and <b>‘air</b> <b>conditioning</b> comfort level’, for justification of occupant behaviors in different living conditions. Study results not only provide valuable benchmarking data serving as references for performance evaluation of different energy-saving strategies, but also show how effective extended building insulation, enhanced air tightness, and prudent selection of residence location and orientation can be for successful implementation of building sustainability in tropical and subtropical regions...|$|R

40|$|Scanning ion micro-beam {{analysis}} {{has been used}} to determine the diffusion of molecules in materials with a combination of high spatial resolution and concentration sensitivity not possible with other analytical techniques. The ion beam analysis apparatus and techniques available at the University of Surrey are described. Methodologies have been devised to determine the scanning micro-beam line scan size and the diameter of the beam spot. Adaptations to the micro-beam line hardware have been proposed with the design of a novel form of none interrupting beam current monitor utilising a transmission Faraday cup and charge collection from the object aperture. Micro-Nuclear Reaction Analysis (NRA) has been used {{for the first time to}} resolve the location and concentration of a hydrocarbon molecule in a biological matrix. Deuterated molecules (a surfactant and a <b>hair</b> <b>conditioning</b> agent) were imaged in perm damaged and undamaged hair fibres. Natural deuterium levels were ascertained with reference to a virgin hair fibre. Profiles of chlorine diffusing into cement paste blends have been determined using micro-Particle Induced X-ray Emission (PIXE). The profiles were fitted with a semi-infinite model of Fickian diffusion. The analysis was combined with micro-NRA to simultaneously profile the aqueous carrier (deuterium oxide) with the diffusing chlorine. A combination of micro-PIXE and micro-NRA has been used for the first time to image the ingress of water (deuterium oxide) and subsequent redistribution of drug in a polymeric drug release system. The two dimensional distributions of water, drug, and polymeric matrix are statistically correlated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract The {{toxicity}} of three brands of hair shampoos (Vinoz, Gentelle and Petals) containing linear alkylbenzene sulphonates and used mostly for <b>hair</b> <b>conditioning</b> in beauty shops by woman in Nigeria were evaluated on fingerlings of the African catfish, Clarias gariepinus (mean weight= 6. 42 ± 0. 2 g; length= 4. 03 ± 0. 1 cm). Specimens {{were exposed to}} 0. 50 %, 0. 25 %, 0. 125 %, 0. 0625 %, 0. 03125 % and 0. 00 % (control) toxicant concentrations during a 96 -hours static bioassay. Mortality increased with concentrations and varied with brand of shampoo used; with the 0. 50 % toxicant concentration and Vinoz shampoo showing highest toxicity. LC 50 for Vinoz, Gentelle and Petals were 0. 0195 %, 0. 0281 % and 0. 0281 % (arithmetic method), 0. 9058 %, 0. 8873 % and 0. 8710 % (logarithmic method) and 0. 0172 %, 0. 0281 % and 0. 0177 % (probit method) respectively. Survivorship of C. gariepinus was significantly homogeneous with Vinoz [F(1. 56) Fcrit(4. 13) ] and heterogeneous with Petals shampoos [F(5. 57) >Fcrit(4. 13) ] at P< 0. 05.

40|$|The {{object of}} the {{invention}} is a device {{for the treatment of}} hair, in particular to produce and correct permanent wave treatments. In the process according to the invention, locks of hair wrapped around curling tongs are shaped by chemical and heat treatment and are fixed permanently or treated with an intensive hair conditioner, said process involving the application of air and atomized or vaporized hair conditioner into the curling tongs by means of a fan, said hair conditioner accessing the hair through openings in the curling tongs. Finally the curled hair lock is dried. The device on which this process is based comprises a basic body and curling tongs shaped as a hollow body. The basic body is equipped with a fan, a heating device, at least one air intake opening, an outlet opening and an inlet arranged in front of the latter for the metered addition of <b>hair</b> <b>conditioning</b> agent. The curling tongs provided with openings is attached to the outlet opening of the basic body.

40|$|A new technique, termed {{spatially}} resolved combing analysis, {{was employed}} to study the conditioning prop-erties of a cationic polymer on various types of hair. In this method, special frames are employed that allow {{the application of a}} treatment to selected areas of the fibers, while shielding the remaining portions as internal reference sections. The combing traces of hair treated in such a way, obtained by using a Diastron tensile tester, show positive or negative peaks depending on whether the treatment results in an increase or a decrease of friction against the hair surface. The method has higher sensitivity than previously employed procedures that involved the measurements of hair before and after conditioning of the whole tress. The conditioning of polyquaternium- 11 was evaluated on untreated, Caucasian brown hair as well as on fibers damaged by oxidative dyeing, bleaching, bleaching/dyeing, and perming. It has been shown that the conditioning effect depends on the type of hair modification. The effect of the polymer on untreated hair is relatively small and becomes apparent only after multiple shampooing, which roughens the untreated sections of hair. For dyed hair, which exhibits three to four times higher combing forces than the reference virgin hair, the adsorbed polyquaternium- 11 reduces the combing forces to the level of untreated <b>hair.</b> The <b>conditioning</b> layer of the polymer can be removed from dyed hair by one to two shampooings. The polymer showed higher substantivity for bleached and perreed <b>hair,</b> with the <b>conditioning</b> effect persisting after multiple shampooings...|$|R

40|$|Cocamide {{diethanolamine}} (DEA) {{and some}} of the other diethanolamides are mainly used as surfactant foam boosters or viscosity increasing agents in cosmetics, although a few are reported to be used as <b>hair</b> and skin <b>conditioning</b> agents, surfactant-cleansing or surfactant-emulsifying agents, or as an opacifying agent. The Cosmetic Ingredient Review (CIR) Expert Panel considered new data and information from previous CIR reports to assess the concerns about the potential for amidases in human skin to convert these diethanolamides into DEA and the corresponding fatty acids. The Expert Panel concluded that these diethanolamides are safe as used when formulated to be nonirritating and when the levels of free DEA in the diethanolamides do not exceed those considered safe by the Panel.

40|$|The {{current study}} {{describes}} the in vitro phosphorylation {{of a human}} hair keratin, using protein kinase for the first time. Phosphorylation of keratin was demonstrated by 31 P NMR (Nuclear Magnetic Resonance) and Diffuse Reflectance Infrared Fourier Transform (DRIFT) techniques. Phosphorylation induced a 2. 5 fold increase of adsorption capacity in the first 10 minutes for cationic moiety like Methylene Blue (MB). Thorough description of MB adsorption process was performed by several isothermal models. Reconstructed fluorescent microscopy images depict distinct amounts of dye bound to the differently treated hair. The results of this work suggest that the enzymatic phosphorylation of keratins might have significant implications in <b>hair</b> shampooing and <b>conditioning,</b> where short application times of cationic components are of prime importance.

40|$|This paper {{considers}} hair care as {{a network}} of activities and routines which have consequences for environmental sustainability and which may be modified by design. It proposes that together with cultural knowledge, embodied skill and objects, these activities {{can be thought of}} as ‘practices’ that are reproduced and also change through time (Shove 2006). They consume resources and are therefore implicated in the issue of environmental sustainability. The paper draws on research into hair care practices conducted through in-depth interviews with female participants, as part of the first author’s PhD study. The discussion here however centres on historical work and Shove’s (2003) writing on bathing to explore the changing products and substances including ideas, technological and infrastructural aspects of cleansing and <b>conditioning</b> <b>hair.</b> Because these factors may determine when to wash or not to wash your hair they affect resource consumption. The paper concludes by outlining opportunities for sustainable design that follow from the insights gained by investigating the history of hair care in relation to the data collected during in-depth interviews. It highlights, as outlined by Hand et al (2005), that the resources consumed through hair care are influenced by the integrative nature of hair {{care as a}} practice rather than by individuals being dedicated to sustainability. To concentrate on single products without taking into account that hair care is practiced in everyday life is not likely to provide opportunities for sustainable living. What is considered ‘normal’ standards of hair care and means to achieve them needs to be conceptualised to identify opportunities to modify what is considered ‘normal’ through design.

40|$|Sound {{conditioning}} is {{a process}} induced by a low-level, non-damaging acoustic stimulus that provides protection against subsequent detrimental forms of acoustic trauma. Many hypotheses have been advanced to explain the effect of sound conditioning, but the mechanisms underlying this phenomenon are still not yet known. There is increasing evidence for endogenous protective systems, which, if enhanced, can provide protection against subsequent damage. The overall objective of this thesis was to study the functional role of the lateral olivocochlear (LOC) system and the mechanisms underlying the phenomenon of sound conditioning. Sound conditioning is effective in protecting against hair cell loss and thereby preserving hearing sensitivity. In this thesis, {{it was found that}} acoustic trauma caused the release of cytochrome c from the mitochondria into the cytoplasm and induced the programmed cell death in the outer <b>hair</b> cells. Sound <b>conditioning</b> was found to trigger a protection against these detrimental changes by upregulating the bcl- 2 level in the outer hair cells. A role of bcl- 2 as an inducible gene underlying protection against acoustic trauma by sound conditioning is demonstrated. Sound conditioning is also effective in protecting against a temporary hearing loss induced by acoustic trauma. The protection by a short-term sound conditioning was found when delivered either before, or after a traumatic exposure. Trauma-induced threshold shifts between 20 - 25 dB were prevented by a forward or backward sound conditioning paradigm at 1 kHz. Since pretreatment with 6 hydroxydopamine blocked the protective effect of sound conditioning by destroying tyrosine hydroxylase (TH) in the cochlea, a role of the lateral efferent system was suggested. TH positive nerve fibers were found only under the inner hair cells and originated from the neurons located in the LOC system. An increase of the TH immunoreactivity both in the fibers and neurons of the LOC system was found after sound conditioning. The elevation of TH is one protective mechanism offered by sound conditioning. Dopamine, a neurotransmitter released from lateral efferents is involved in the modulation of the auditory nerve activity. The D 1 receptor and its signal transduction pathway in the cochlea were characterized. The D 1 receptor was found in the spiral ganglia neurons and their afferent dendrites under the inner hair cells. A D 1 agonist enhanced the amplitude of cochlear compound action potential (CAP) and increased the level of GluR 1 phosphorylation at the PKA site (Ser 845). These effects were abolished by a protein kinase A (PKA) inhibitor. Conversely, a D 1 antagonist inhibited the CAP amplitude and decreased the level of GluR 1 phosphorylation, while a PKA activator prevented theses effects. These findings demonstrated a positive effect of the D 1 receptor on the auditory nerve activity through the PKA-dependent the GluR 1 phosphorylation.
