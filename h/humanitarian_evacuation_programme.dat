40|$|In complex human {{emergency}} (CHE) -aid situations, {{the international}} community responds to provide assistance to reduce morbidity and mortality related to environmental and civil disruptions. The political and social situation in Kosovo, {{in combination with the}} military activity from 23 March to 09 June, 1999, created a crisis associated with mass movement of the population of Kosovo into neighbouring provinces and nations. This forced migration of people seeking protection increased demands for -water, food, shelter, and health care in the refugee areas. The United Nations High Commission for Refugees (UNHCR) estimated that 771, 900 ethnic Albanians, and 30, 700 Serbians, Croatians, and Montenegrins had been displaced from Kosovo during this time period, and that 439, 500 of these people had arrived in Albania. Given the limited health-care resources in Albania to respond to the increasing demands for health care, a field epidemiological study was conducted by the International Organization for Migration (IOM) to assess the need for a medical evacuation program from Albania related to the crisis in Kosovo. Outcome measurements in this assessment were: 1) health-care capacity and health-care utilization rates in Albania before the crisis and by the refugees during the crisis; 2) the frequency of war-related injuries; 3) the frequency of medical evacuation; 4) nature of medical conditions of the patients being evacuated; and 5) destination for medical evacuation (internal or international) during the crisis. The results of the field assessment, which gathered health outcome data during the first eight weeks of the conflict (23 March 1999 to 25 May 1999), indicated that there was a need for a specifically designed medical <b>evacuation</b> <b>programme</b> in Albania. The study demonstrated that the implementation of a medical <b>evacuation</b> <b>programme</b> must be integrated with the national health care objectives. It also was found that the magnitude of an <b>evacuation</b> <b>programme</b> could be reduced markedly by strategic support of existing medical programmes in Albania (haemodialysis, trauma and orthopaedics, blood banking). Implementation of this strategy could permit containment of the majority of cases within Albania or to regional, health-care facilities. The results of such targeted support for specific services could result in a national programme for internal medical evacuation, with limited dependence upon the international movement of patient...|$|R

This study attempts to describe the experiences of service providers at the international, national, and local levels, involved in the organization and delivery of health and settlement services in Canada for the Kosovar refugees. Methods A qualitative case study design using key informant interviews was used. Nominated sampling was used to identify 17 individuals involved in the organization and delivery of health and settlement. Key themes were identified and recommendations made to provide a framework for the development of policy to guide {{response to}} future humanitarian emergencies. Results Six themes emerged: (1) A sense of being overwhelmed, (2) A multitude of health issues, (3) critical challenges in providing health care, (4) access to health and settlement services, (5) overall successes and (6) need for a coordinated approach to migration health.

The directors of the CORB were hopeful that the programme could be continued, and presented a report into the sinking which made recommendations for future operations, which included the use of faster transports and escorts on the North Atlantic routes, and the concentration of the <b>evacuation</b> <b>programme</b> on routes to Australia, India and South Africa, where the weather was better and there were felt to be fewer enemy submarines. The Admiralty {{pointed out that there}} were insufficient fast escorts and ships available, and public opinion was opposed to the continuation of overseas evacuation, fearing further tragedies. Winston Churchill also opposed the scheme, believing evacuations gave aid and comfort to the enemy. [...] The government announced the cancellation of the CORB programme, and all children who were currently preparing to sail were ordered to disembark and return home.

40|$|Background The total number, rates, {{and causes}} of {{mortality}} in Kosovo {{during the last}} war remain unclear despite intense international attention. Understanding mortality that results from modern warfare, in which 90 % of casualties are civilian, and identifying vulnerable civilian groups, are of critical public-health importance. Methods In September 1999 we conducted a two-stage cluster survey among the Kosovar Albanian population in Kosovo. We collected retrospective mortality data, including cause of death, {{for the period of}} the conflict. Findings The survey included 1197 households comprising 8605 people. From February, 1998, through June, 1999, 67 (64 %) of 105 deaths in the sample population were attributed to war-related trauma, corresponding to 12 000 (95 % CI 5500 – 18 300) deaths in the total population. The crude mortality rate increased 2 · 3 times from the pre-conflict level to 0 · 72 per 1000 a month. Mortality rates peaked in April 1999 at 3 · 25 per 1000 a month, coinciding with an intensification of the Serbian campaign of “ethnic cleansing”. Men of military age (15 – 49 years) and men 50 years and older had the highest age-specific mortality rates from war-related trauma. However, the latter group were more than three times as likely to die of war-related trauma than were men of military age (relative risk 3 · 2). Interpretation Raising awareness among the international humanitarian community of the increased risk of mortality from war-related trauma among men of 50 years and older in some settings is an urgent priority. Establishing <b>evacuation</b> <b>programmes</b> to assist older people to find refuge may prevent loss of life. Such mortality data could be used as evidence that governments and military groups have violated international standards of conduct during warfare. Lancet 2000; 355 : 2204 – 0...|$|R

Recent AMI operations have highlighted a new scenario for the deployment of air transport fleets: future years are likely to show an even more deep evolution of AMI role, during both in country and international airlift operations. AMI managed to meet these requirements by means of a new airlift fleet and a deep organizational change into its supportability system.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedSince the Maastricht Treaty, the European Union (EU) operates under three key pillars. The second pillar, {{known as the}} Common Foreign and Security Policy (CFSP), introduced the need among Member States to develop a common European Security and Defense Policy (ESDP). Aimed at providing police and military capabilities to the CFSP, this idea represented a new important element in the European integration progress. ESDP was launched formally in June 1999, establishing ESDP's mission roots on what it {{is known as the}} three "Petersberg Tasks," (1) <b>Humanitarian</b> and <b>Evacuation</b> Missions, (2) Peace Keeping Missions, and (3) Combat Missions for Crisis Management. The aim of EU was to upgrade its role and influence in the international arena, with no intention of overcoming NATO's role and capabilities in the field of collective defense. The purpose of this thesis is to demonstrate the perspectives {{for the development of the}} European Security and Defense Policy and to stress the need to consider Electronic Warfare a critical asset in the military and technological capability options. The need for common operational concepts, doctrines and training, especially in the field of EW, becomes a necessity as Joint EU Armed Forces report active and ready to manage regional and international crisis. However, the study of ESDP's current status shows that EW, an important military component, has been addressed but not emphasized properly. In order to demonstrate EW's "weight", an imaginary scenario, under the name "Save Atlantia 2008 ", has been created in which an advance software program, (i. e., IMOM model), simulates EW effects. The Improved Many-on-Many (IMOM) computer software, presently used by the U. S. Air Force to model the Electronic Order of Battle (EOB), will be used to model the Radar and Tactical Jamming System and conclusions will be based on the theoretical expected jamming effectiveness of the Joint European Air Force against several radar systems in the imaginary scenario.

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{analyzes}} discourses {{and practices}} of flood response and {{adaptation to climate change}} in Mozambique. It builds on recent publications on climate change adaptation that suggest that the successes and failures of adaptation highly depend on the cultural and political realms of societal perceptions and the sensitivity of institutions. To capture this, the paper adopted a multi-sited ethnographic approach. Acknowledging that there is no central locus of representation that can unveil the working of disaster response in Mozambique, the paper brings together five vignettes of research in different ‘sites’ of concern to the rise in floods in Mozambique. These are the politics of climate change adaptation at the national institutional level, societal responses to increased flooding, local people's responses to floods, the <b>evacuation</b> and resettlement <b>programme</b> following the 2007 flood. The paper finds how adaptation to climate change becomes part of everyday politics, how actors aim to incorporate responses into the continuation of their normal behavior and how elites are better positioned to take advantage of adaptation programmes than the vulnerable people that were targeted. It argues that climate change adaptation must be made consonant with historically grown and ongoing social and institutional processes. It concludes with lessons that the analysis and methodology of the research can provide for the practice of climate change adaptation...|$|R
