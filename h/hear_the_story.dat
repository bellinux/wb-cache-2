25|$|Bruce Ivins was born, {{and spent}} his youth, in Lebanon, Ohio, {{a small town}} 30 miles {{northeast}} of Cincinnati. His parents were Thomas Randall Ivins and Mary Johnson (nee Knight) Ivins, {{and he was the}} youngest of three brothers. His father, a pharmacist, owned a drugstore and was active in the local Rotary Club and Chamber of Commerce. The family went regularly to Lebanon Presbyterian Church, although Ivins was later a Catholic parishioner. According to C.W. Ivins, one of Ivins' older brothers, their mother Mary was violent and physically abusive to all three children. When she discovered she was pregnant with Bruce, a pregnancy that was unplanned and unwanted, she repeatedly tried to abort the child by throwing herself down a set of stairs. Ivins would eventually <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> of his mother's attempt to abort him.|$|E
500|$|In a 2012 {{meeting with}} Bhansali, Kumar {{told him about}} the film; he {{explained}} that this was a kind of cinema contrary to Bhansali's signature work. Still, Bhansali wanted to <b>hear</b> <b>the</b> <b>story</b> and was also enthusiastic towards the project. After hearing the script, he liked it and immediately agreed to produce the film. However, Kumar's colleagues were not sure if a film based in Manipur would be well received by the audience. This concern evaporated after the 2012 Summer Olympics, where Kom won a bronze medal. Her win also highlighted her previous achievements. After the news of the development of the film broke in the media, the makers clarified that the film was in development since 2011, much before the Olympics, and they were not influenced by her recent success. In an interview with Press Trust of India, Bhansali revealed that the story of the film was so inspiring, it touched his heart and described the film as [...] "a rare experiment". He added [...] "Not many films are based on biopics of living people. I am proud that I am part of this film." ...|$|E
