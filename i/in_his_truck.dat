5|$|Anderson and Ward {{exploit the}} new {{information}} to concoct a plan, luring identified KKK collaborators to a bogus meeting. The Klan members soon realize it is a set-up and leave without discussing the murders. The FBI then concentrate on Lester Cowens, a Klansman of interest, who exhibits a nervous demeanor which the agents believe might yield a confession. The FBI pick him up and interrogate him. Later, Cowens is at home when his window is shattered by a shotgun blast. After seeing a burning cross on his lawn, Cowens tries to flee <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck,</b> but is caught by several hooded men who intend to hang him. The FBI arrive to rescue him, having staged the whole scenario; the hooded men are revealed to be other agents.|$|E
5|$|Kehoe {{drove up}} to the school about half an hour after the explosion. He saw Superintendent Huyck and summoned him over to his truck. Charles Hawson testified at the inquest that he saw the two men {{struggle}} over some type of long gun before Kehoe detonated the dynamite stored <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck,</b> killing himself, Superintendent Huyck, Nelson McFarren (a retired farmer), and Cleo Clayton, an eight-year-old second grader. Clayton had survived the first blast and had wandered out of the school building debris; he was killed by the fragmentation from the exploding vehicle. The explosion also mortally wounded postmaster Glenn O. Smith, who lost a leg and died later that day of his wounds, and injured several others.|$|E

5|$|Events {{come to a}} {{head when}} Ryotaro Dojima mistakenly accuses the protagonist of being {{involved}} in the murders. Nanako is kidnapped during the protagonist's interrogation, leading Ryotaro to engage in a vehicular pursuit with the culprit. The chase ends as they both crash; the kidnapper escapes with Nanako through a television set <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck,</b> and the gravely-injured Ryotaro entrusts her rescue to the group. The group tracks them down within the TV world; the culprit, Taro Namatame, becomes a god-like monster—Kunino-sagiri—which attacks them but is defeated, and both he and Nanako are taken to the Inaba hospital. When Nanako appears to die, the group furiously confronts Namatame; as the protagonist, the player must help the others realize that Namatame is not the killer by pointing out the lack of a proper motive, and subsequently work to determine that Ryotaro's assistant, Tohru Adachi, is the true killer. Failure to do so ends the game with the party unable to solve the case; Nanako either remaining dead, or reviving but remaining hospitalised; and the recurring fog permanently setting in, the last of which will eventually lead to humanity's demise.|$|E

25|$|He was hit {{again in}} July 1969.

The lightning first hit nearby trees and was deflected into the open window of the truck. The strike knocked Sullivan unconscious and burned off his eyebrows and eyelashes, and set his hair on fire. The uncontrolled truck kept moving until it stopped near a cliff edge.|$|E

25|$|In September 2017, {{the body}} of Randy Potter, 53, of Lenexa, Kansas, was found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> in Economy Lot B. It had {{decomposed}} {{to the point where}} its race and gender was not obvious; Potter had gone to the airport one morning in January and killed himself with a gun. His family had {{at the time of his}} apparent disappearance given the license plate number of his truck to airport authorities, who assured him that they recorded the plates of all vehicles parked in the lots on a daily basis and would check it against that data base regularly. The apparent failure of this system to locate Potter's truck for eight months has led to a investigation by city government.|$|E
25|$|A {{total of}} 18 {{passengers}} survived the collision. Passengers {{who were able}} to see downstream became aware of the rapidly closing motions of the vessels, and rightly concluded that the collision was imminent. Fourteen of the survivors were thrown clear and surfaced without difficulty. Three others were briefly trapped under the George Prince. The last survivor had run back to his vehicle, thinking he would be safer <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck.</b> After the collision, he managed to escape his sinking vehicle through a window. Only one survivor had a life jacket before going into the water, but had not had time to put it on. Two others found life jackets floating in the river, which they used for a short time, but neither man had time to properly don the life jackets.|$|E
25|$|While on {{a hunting}} trip in 1989 at Taylor Ranch in Colorado, Parker met Oklahoma City {{businessman}} Robert A. Funk. After Funk discovered that Parker was a wildlife artist, he asked Parker {{if he had}} any examples of his work to show him. It just so happened that the artist had an elk bust sculpture called Perfection <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck</b> and, after showing it to Funk, a sale was consummated on the spot for the sculpture. Parker would meet Funk again at the C. M. Russell Art Show in 1999 and some years later he suggested to Funk that he could design a sculpture of a Clydesdale horse to be given as an award to exemplary employees of Funk's Express Employment Professionals company in Oklahoma City. A deal was struck between the two that resulted in Parker casting a now sold out 50-piece edition called Express Ranch Clydesdale. Over time, Funk has added several more Parker sculptures to his collection, including a monumental bronze elk sculpture for the entrance to his New Mexico ranch.|$|E

He said afterwards he drove her to Southampton, where they exchanged contact details before he left her, and that she was [...] "smiling and happy". He did not come forward after police appealed for details of the driver who had given her a lift because he did not want his wife to learn of his infidelity. He claimed her photographs and other belongings were in his possession because she had left them <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>truck,</b> and the mattress had become stained with blood because a man had lain on it after gashing his leg while the vehicle was on loan to another driver in 1994.|$|E
