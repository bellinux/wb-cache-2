The performance levels documented within the existing studies justify the expectation of great gender-specific differences despite self-selection and <b>external</b> <b>selection</b> processes (Baumert et al. 2001).

His concept of “pathways of viability” is aligned {{with the work of}} evolutionary theorists such as Waddington, von Bertalanffy, Riedl, and Kauffman, who reject external physical causation in favor of internally-driven “stimulus-and-response” and therefore move the focus from <b>external</b> <b>selection</b> to epigenetic mechanisms. Such a cybernetic evolutionary theory responds to various open questions in biology and management theory, including the dispute between homogenists and heterogenists as well as “path-Independence” in companies.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the phrase {{structure}} of Danish nominal phrases. It is assumed that phrase structure must account for two types of selection wrt. nominal phrases, i. e. <b>external</b> <b>selection</b> and internal selection. By <b>external</b> <b>selection</b> is meant that other categories {{should be able to}} select a nominal phrase non-disjunctively.

Modern theories of phrase structure are commonly based on x-bar theory and phrase structure conforms to the x-bar schema proposed by Chomsky (1970), with optional specifier and complement attaching at each their level. This analysis is an NP analysis, or a specifier analysis. Another analysis is proposed by Abney (1987). He assumes that determiners are functional heads, other determiners and the noun functioning as the complement of a functional head. Abney’s analysis is a DP analysis or functional head analysis.

40|$|This paper uses a {{personal}} creativity theory to analogize organizational creative process {{and tries to}} build a model of organizational creative process. This approach analyses creativity from an evolutionary viewpoint, which believes creativity {{is the process of}} variation, selection and retention. In our model, organizational creative process begins from generation of variation, which must survive under the internal selection and <b>external</b> <b>selection,</b> thus becomes a recognized creativity or innovation. By application of this model, we can explain what characteristics of industry and organization will generate better creativity. Additionally, industry environment will influence organizational creative process through internal selection and <b>external</b> <b>selection</b> criteria setting. This paper takes Talwanese internet industry for case study. BACKGROUND There have long been four different approach which includes product, personality, place and process, so-called " 4 P " in creativity theory. Some researchers propose that through improving cognitive skills or creativity-relevant skills (process perspective) people can enhance their creative performance. In contrast, there have been few efforts in understanding organizational creative process and entrepreneurial process (Russell, 1999 [l]; Brazeal & Herbert, 199912]). From the process perspective, we can capture the dynamics of the creative process itself and know how creative ideas generate...|$|E
40|$|Excerpt] Utility {{analysis}} {{has been described}} as 2 ̆ 7 a family of theories and measures designed to describe, predict, and/or explain what determines the usefulness or desirability of decision options, and to examine how information affects decisions 2 ̆ 7 (Boudreau, 1991, p. 621). Utility analysis (UA) evolved to provide tools for better describing and communicating the impact of HRM and industrial psychology interventions on organizational goals. Most UA research has been based on an implicit assumption that such communication would be aimed toward managers, who control the resources necessary to implement such interventions. Previous research has noted the need to move beyond developing new measures of utility parameters, and to focus on the role of UA information in managerial decision processes (Boudreau, 1989, 1991). Yet there remains a lack of research exploring these issues. In this chapter, we attempt to explicate some of these underlying assumptions and suggest how future UA research may fruitfully test them. We focus specifically on areas where the practice of human resource management seems to diverge from the implied behaviors of UA theory. These deviations provide potential clues about how to enhance the accuracy and usefulness of UA models, and suggest new directions for future UA research and practice. The themes developed in this chapter relate to UA applications in training, compensation, performance assessment, and internal staffing. However, for simplicity and exposition, we will use the <b>external</b> <b>selection</b> model as our guiding framework. <b>External</b> <b>selection</b> is the focus of a significant proportion of UA research, so using this model will relate our themes to a large body of literature. Using the <b>external</b> <b>selection</b> model, this review will attempt to 2 ̆ 7 open up the black boxes 2 ̆ 7 of four fundamental UA processes: 1.

The chapter draws its theoretical basis from the intraorganizational evolutionary perspective and the literature on emotions in organizations. The case of a corporate venturing initiative and the narratives of four managers involved directly and indirectly in the initiative are used to illustrate how the emotional dynamics of organizational members evoked envy toward a venturing initiative and directly impacted its degree of competition and complementarity with other interacting initiatives, ultimately hampering its selection...|$|E

40|$|Examining the {{relationship}} between the competitive processes between and within organizations, we use selection system theory to link resource value to product value. We identify three dimensions (in-selection, before-selection and after-selection) that facilitate determining the value of resources based on the functions they serve in the competitive process between organizations in the product market, i. e. the <b>external</b> <b>selection</b> system. Subsequently, we use these dimensions to explore the competitive process among resource providers within organizations, i. e. the internal selection system. This leads us to formulate three propositions that link the competitive process within organizations to the competitive process between organizations. First, we posit that if resources that individually score highly along only one of the three dimensions are bundled, {{it is more likely that}} organizational performance can be sustained. Second, we argue that providers of resources scoring highly along multiple dimensions will enjoy stronger means of appropriation in comparison with providers of resources scoring highly along only one of the three dimensions. Third, we contend that the extent to which an organization endeavours to remunerate its resource providers based on their perceived contribution to the organization's competitive position has a curvilinear (inverted U-shaped) relationship with organizational performance...|$|E

40|$|In {{the context}} of cancer {{diagnosis}} and treatment, we consider the problem of constructing an accurate prediction rule {{on the basis of}} a relatively small number of tumor tissue samples of known type containing the expression data on very many (possibly thousands) genes. Recently, results have been presented in the literature suggesting that it is possible to construct a prediction rule from only a few genes such that it has a negligible prediction error rate. However, in these results the test error or the leave-one-out cross-validated error is calculated without allowance for the selection bias. There is no allowance because the rule is either tested on tissue samples that were used in the first instance to select the genes being used in the rule or because the cross-validation of the rule is not <b>external</b> to the <b>selection</b> process; that is, gene selection is not performed in training the rule at each stage of the cross-validation process. We describe how in practice the selection bias can be assessed and corrected for by either performing a cross-validation or applying the bootstrap <b>external</b> to the <b>selection</b> process. We recommend using 10 -fold rather than leave-one-out cross-validation, and concerning the bootstrap, we suggest using the so-called. 632 + bootstrap error estimate designed to handle overfitted prediction rules.
