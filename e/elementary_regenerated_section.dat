40|$|AbstractMost of the CO 2 {{post-combustion}} capture units {{under development}} for fossil-fuel based power plants {{rely on the}} use of alkanolamine aqueous solutions. The correct design of absorbing and <b>regenerating</b> <b>sections</b> of these processes require robust thermodynamic and kinetic models. This legitimates current research efforts in the field of the characterization of aqueous alkanolamine loaded solutions. In this study, the potentialities of Raman spectroscopy are investigated. The obtention of species distribution for MDEA loaded solutions at 40  °C is described. Numerical adjustments of thermodynamic parameters from spectral measurements for MEA and DEA is also performed. Compared to other classical analytical tools, a strong interest is shown for the analysis of tertiary amines solutions and potentially for kinetic measurements...|$|R

50|$|In Sclerasterias, fissiparity {{seems to}} be {{confined}} to very young individuals. In these, there is a transitory hexamerous symmetry in what is a normally a pentamerously symmetrical genus. The immature individuals with 6 arms appear so different in appearance from mature individuals with 5 arms that they were at one time considered to be two different genera, Hydrasterias and Sclerasterias. Juveniles with arms measuring between 8mm and 15mm (occasionally 20mm) are usually involved in fission and undergo multiple divisions. A sample of 36 young Sclerasterias euplecta of this size was examined. 9 had only 5 arms and did not show evidence of fissiparity while the remainder had 6 arms, usually 3 longer than the other 3, following prior fission. In another sample of juvenile Scierasterias heteropau, the arms were similarly arranged in groups of three and there were 4 madreporites, 2 on the original and 2 on the <b>regenerated</b> <b>section.</b> Active fissiparity {{seems to be}} correlated with 6 arms and 4 madreporites. At some stage in their development as yet unexplained, only 5 arms and one madreporite appear, {{and the ability to}} divide in this way is lost.|$|R
40|$|A {{morphological}} analysis using radiography and computed tomography {{was performed in}} a total of 17 bone segments following single or double bone transport in 11 and 3 patients, respectively. All bone transports involved the tibia, with the exception of 2 single bone transports, which were femoral. The following parameters were measured: cortical wall thickness, sectional area of the medullary canal, and density of the cortical bone and medullary canal in Hounsfield units (H. U.). The regenerated segments showed a cortical thickness and density that were less than the contralateral portion, with an enlargement of the medullary canal and an increase in density due to the presence of cancellous bone in the medullary area. Successive controls showed an increase in thickness and density of the cortical bone and a small reduction in the diameter of the medullary canal and its cancellous bone. The variations in the cortical and the medullary canal apperead to be independent of the length of the regenerated segment. In the 3 tibia treated by double bone transport, the anatomical variations in the distal regenerated portion varied less than from normal values than the proximal portion of the same segment. In the 2 femurs examined, enlargement of the <b>regenerated</b> <b>section</b> was smaller with respect to cases involving regeneration of the proximal tibia. These differences are presumably dependent on {{the fact that in the}} latter case, a more vascularized segment is produced after osteotomy in spongy bone, with respect to those involving the distal tibia or femur. Double transport is preferable due to the reduced treatment times...|$|R

After decalcification was confirmed radiographically, we proceeded to place them in paraffin and section them with a microtome into 4 -μm thick sections. The sites for histological evaluation were the proximal end of the regenerate (Level 1), the central area of the regenerate (Level 2), and the distal end of the <b>regenerate</b> (Level 3). <b>Sections</b> were stained with hematoxylin and eosin (H.E.), Masson’s trichrome and Safranin-O and analyzed with a microscope with an image analysis system (Leica Q 500 MC, Cambridge, UK).|$|R
50|$|The recent £50m {{rebuilding}} of the Crown Centre shopping mall, which originally opened in 1985 has <b>regenerated</b> a large <b>section</b> {{of the town}} centre.

Work on demolishing the original Crown Centre and Bell Street multi-storey car park took place in the spring of 2012 and the project was completed by autumn 2013. Development of the new centre was completed in late October 2013 in which Tesco opened its doors to new customers in the same period.

40|$|The axon {{reaction}} in {{the central nervous system}} was studied using a monoclonal antibody to phosphorylated neurofilaments. Axotomy was performed by cutting the nigrostriatal pathway. We were able to show that phosphorylated epitopes of neurofilaments, that are usually restricted to axons, could be detected in the perikarya and dendrites of axotomized neurons as early as 3 days postlesion. These neurons remained labelled up to 17 days after axotomy and in some cases even up to 6 weeks. The cytoplasmic changes appearing in the lesioned neurons 8 days after axotomy seem to indicate that these neurons will probably degenerate or survive only in an atrophied, non-functional state as they are unable to <b>regenerate</b> their <b>sectioned</b> axon. Neurochemical lesions, using the neurotoxin 6 -OH-dopamine, were performed to establish whether this reaction of perikaryal neurofilament phosphorylation may be a non-specific phenomenon accompanying neuronal degeneration or injury. Although cell loss was important, no labelled neurons could be observed following 6 -OH-dopamine treatment. These results indicate that the induction of perikaryal neurofilament phosphorylation is a response to selective types of neuronal injury and concerns selective neuronal populations.

40|$|Regeneration poses a {{distinctive}} {{set of problems}} for evolutionary biologists, {{but there has been}} little substantive progress since these issues were clearly outlined in the monograph of T. H. Morgan (1901). The champions at regeneration among vertebrates are the urodele amphibians such as the newt, and we tend to regard urodele regeneration as an exceptional attribute. The ability to <b>regenerate</b> large <b>sections</b> of the body plan is widespread in metazoan phylogeny, although it is not universal. It is striking that in phylogenetic contexts where regeneration occurs, closely related species are observed which do not possess this ability. It is a challenge to reconcile such variation between species with a conventional selective interpretation of regeneration. The critical hypothesis from phylogenetic analysis is that regeneration is a basic, primordial attribute of metazoans rather than a mechanism which has evolved independently in a variety of contexts. In order to explain its absence in closely related species, it is postulated to be lost secondarily for reasons which are not understood. Our approach to this question is to compare a differentiated newt cell with its mammalian counterpart in respect of the plasticity of differentiation...|$|R
40|$|Duchenne muscular {{dystrophy}} (DMD) is a neuromuscular disease {{linked to the}} lack of the dystrophin, a submembrane protein, leading to muscle weakness and associated with a defect of the lipid metabolism. A study of the fatty acid composition of glycerophosphatidylcholines by matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-ToF-MS) and tandem mass spectrometry (MS/MS) enabled us to characterize a change of the lipid composition of dystrophic cells {{at the time of the}} differentiation. This modification has been used as a marker to identify with profiling and imaging MALDI-ToF MS <b>regenerating</b> areas in <b>sections</b> of an mdx mouse leg muscle. It is the first time that such a slight change in fatty acid composition has been observed directly on tissue slices using mass spectrometry. This approach will be useful in monitoring the treatment of muscular regeneration...|$|R
40|$|Australian {{regional}} city regeneration in Australia {{is increasingly}} becoming an important topic {{as they attempt}} to position themselves mid-way between larger discourses about capital cities and peri-urban landscapes. Historically these cities, like Newcastle, Wollongong and Geelong, have been marginalised in infrastructure and planning support systems, yet subject to erratic Commonwealth and State funded initiatives that have divested major specific-purpose complexes into their cities. Such has been as a consequence of of 2 ̆ 7 decentralisation 2 ̆ 7 and 2 ̆ 7 regionalisation 2 ̆ 7 political platforms, but also to address employment and voting needs. As an example, Geelong embraced contemporary industrialism, particularly automotive, and built on its port and wool export capacities. Politics, intransigence and lack of economic investment compounded the failure to create quality urban fabric and enable innovative planning. With this legacy, this regional city finds itself at the cusp of heavy industry disintegration, education and health sectorial growth, population increases aided by regional escapism, and a lethargic city centre. In attempting to redress these trends, Geelong is consciously attempting to re-image itself, <b>regenerate</b> key <b>sections</b> of its urban fabric, but also manage the regional escapism (sea change / tree change) phenomena. This paper critiques the larger context, and then uses three examples - "Vision 2 " in the city centre, the Mega Port proposal, Fyansford Green and the Moolap salt marsh - as foils to reflect whether these initiatives are and can assist the facilitation of city structural change, economic renewal and enhanced urban design and place-making outcomes...|$|R
40|$|To {{assess whether}} the {{biochemical}} characteristics of peat can provide clues for past ecosystem changes or not, a study {{was carried out}} combining elemental analysis, micro-morphological counts and neutral monosaccharide determination of peat organic matter (OM) and the dominant living plants from a formerly cut-over peat bog in the Jura Mountains. Peat profiles (up to 50 cm depth) from two distinctive zones (bare peat, FRA and a regenerating stage, FRC) were compared with the reference profile (FRD) taken from an unexploited area of the bog. The results show contrasting OM composition along the profiles. In the upper sections of the FRD and FRC profiles, high C/N ratios and sugar contents (in the same range as in the source plants) and the large predominance of well preserved plant tissues indicate good preservation of primary biological inputs. In contrast, in peat from the FRA profile and deeper levels of the FRC profile, lower C/N ratios, lower amounts of sugars and a predominance of amorphous OM and mucilage suggest more extensive OM degradation. These features delineate a clear threshold between an uppermost "new" <b>regenerating</b> peat <b>section</b> and an "old" catotelm peat below. Nevertheless, even in the latter, the sugar contents remain relatively high (> 80 mg/g) compared with other organic and mineral soils. Analysis of typical peat-forming plants and of bulk peat and fine grained fractions allowed identification of the following source indicators: xylose and arabinose for Cyperaceae; rhamnose, galactose and mannose for mosses; and ribose (and to a lesser extent, hemicellulosic glucose) possibly for microbial synthesis...|$|R
40|$|Local {{mechanical}} conditions {{are known to}} play a role during the regeneration of musculoskeletal tissues, and histomorphometrical investigations of the time course of healing have enabled specific conclusions regarding the mechanosensitivity of tissue differentiation. However, the mechanism for this influence is not clearly understood. In order to extend this analysis, it is essential to link local histological understanding with direct characterisation of the local mechanical environment. Digital image correlation (DIC) is a computer-based image analysis technique that enables the non-contact measurement of strains on material surfaces and is finding application in many areas of biomechanics. Here we report a DIC technique to investigate the local distribution of mechanical strain within <b>regenerating</b> soft tissue <b>sections.</b> We provide exemplary data from analysis of a section of sheep bone callus. An assessment of displacement measurement accuracy gave an RMS error of 4. 2 microm, corresponding to an estimated strain error of 1. 4 %. The sections showed concentrations of up to four times the applied strain and comparison of the strain patterns with histological analysis confirmed that these concentrations reflected boundaries between hard and soft callus...|$|R
40|$|Previous {{in vitro}} {{studies have shown that}} X-irradiation during early {{postnatal}} life can change the environment of CNS tissue in later adult life such that it becomes more supportive of neurite regeneration from adult dorsal root ganglion (DRG) neurons than non-irradiated tissue. The question arises whether or not x-irradiation during adult life can alter the CNS environment such that it also becomes more supportive of neurite regeneration. This was investigated by exposing portions of the spinal cord of adult rats to 10, 20 or 40 Gray of X-irradiation and later using this tissue to prepare cryosections suitable for use as a substrate in a cryoculture assay. Fixed cryocultures were immunolabelled using anti-glial fibrillary acidic protein (GFAP) to visualise the tissue sections and anti-growth associated protein (GAP- 43) to visualise the <b>regenerating</b> neurites. Tissue <b>sections</b> from sham-irradiated animals and from those irradiated with 10 Gray did not support the regeneration of neurites. However, sections of spinal cords from rats treated with either 20 or 40 Gray of X-irradiation 4 or 32 days prior to sampling were found to support a certain degree of neurite regeneration. It is concluded that X-irradiation of adult CNS tissue can alter its environment such that it becomes more supportive of neurite regeneration and it is speculated that this change {{may be the result of}} alterations in the glial cell populations in the post-irradiated tissues...|$|R
40|$|Following nerve <b>section,</b> <b>regenerating</b> axons {{from the}} {{proximal}} stump grow preferentially towards the distal stump. It has been postulated {{that this may}} result from {{the release of a}} neurotropic factor. To investigate whether the protein nerve growth factor (NGF) plays such a role, we immunised adult rats against NGF and examined the effect on regeneration of sectioned nerves through Y-shaped silastic tubes towards either the distal stump or an empty arm. Regeneration through the tubes was assessed electrophysiologically and the number of myelinated and nonmyelinated fibres at different sites was quantified using electron microscopy. There was electrophysiological evidence of regeneration towards the distal nerve stump in all the animals and {{there was no significant difference}} between the immunised and control animals in the size of compound action potential (CAP) ratios. Histologically, the majority of axons were found to have regenerated towards the distal nerve stump in 9 / 10 of the control animals and 7 / 9 of the immunised animals and there was no significant difference between the two groups in the numbers of regenerating myelinated or unmyelinated axons. However, in the immunised animals both myelinated and unmyelinated axons were slightly but significantly smaller and the myelin sheaths were thinner than in the control animals. In 2 immunised animals and none of the controls a small CAP was recorded while stimulating distal to the 'empty arm' and the presence of a small number of myelinated and unmyelinated axons was confirmed histologically. We conclude that as depletion of NGF does not block the preferential growth of regenerating axons towards the distal nerve stump it does not play the major neurotropic role in nerve regeneration. The reduction in size and myelin thickness of the regenerated axons after immunisation confirms the neurotrophic effects of NGF...|$|R
