40|$|This paper compares three {{methods to}} {{determine}} the earing profile that appears during the <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>test</b> of a circular steel sheet. Three steel grades will be studied. The first method is an experimental test made by a hydraulic press. The second one is a finite ele-ment method (FEM) deep-drawing simulation using a micro-macro texture based constitutive law. The last one directly determines the general aspect of the earing profile from the yield locus which is computed from the initial texture. The goal {{of this study is}} to validate the last approach. So, an earing profile prediction can quickly be obtained just from material’s tex-ture. Peer reviewe...|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In the deep-drawing process, the {{application}} of low-frequency vibration to the blank material has recently been focused on {{with the aim of}} improving the friction performance between the die and the blank material. A servo-controlled press machine is suitable for applying low-frequency vibration to the blank during the deep-drawing process, because the punch speed and blank holder force (BHF) are easily controlled as process parameters by using the servo motors. In this study, a BHF with low-frequency vibration was proposed as a technique for improving deep-drawability, which is mainly affected by the friction performance and the lubricant condition. We found that the friction performance between the blank surface and the blank holder was decreased {{in the case of a}} BHF with low-frequency vibration since the lubricating oil rapidly flowed into the clearance during the forming process. Furthermore, for a BHF with low-frequency vibration, the punch force and the deformation resistance were lower than those in a <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>test</b> without low-frequency vibration...|$|E
40|$|Forming of pure {{molybdenum}} crucible {{is greatly}} demanded for its broad application in production of single crystal sapphire. To fabricate molybdenum crucible and other sheet metal products of molybdenum, {{it is necessary}} to determine the limiting draw ratio and frictional data with the aid of finite element analysis to reduce the massive experiments. To ensure the accuracy of finite element analysis, it is crucial to determine the reproducible frictional data. In this study, an evaluation methodology combined hot <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>test</b> with numerical simulation used to investigate the formability and tribological behavior of pure molybdenum at elevated temperature. For calculation of friction coefficient, the isothermal deep-drawing tests were carried out at the temperature ranging from 993 to 1143 K under lubricated and dry conditions. According to the predicted relation between frictional coefficient and forming temperature, the influences of forming temperature, lubrication, and blank diameter on friction are discussed, and the limiting draw ratios of molybdenum sheet at various temperatures are obtained. It is found that there is a significant improvement in drawability of pure molybdenum from 1. 2 at room temperature to 1. 98 at 1143 K by using boron nitride lubricant. However, the effect of forming temperature on the formability of molybdenum sheet is not significant under dry friction condition. Compared with the experimental results, the method used for evaluation of the formability and friction characteristic in hot deep drawing of molybdenum sheet is verified efficiently.

40|$|AbstractThe {{occurrences of}} {{earrings}} in circular-shell <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>tests</b> for {{two different types}} of crystal materials were investigated. The simulation was conducted with whole 360 ̊circumference analysis. As the first result, the earring height is proportional not only to ΔR/Rave but also to ΔTLave ((R 90 -R 00) /Rave). Secondly, the optimum m-value in yield function for the pure titanium and the low-carbon aluminum-killed steel, which led to the fairly good reproduction of experimental results, is 8 and 2 respectively. Furthermore, the blank mesh pattern is assumed to clarify the influence of R-values of three directions...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the variation of the required punch load during the deep drawing process under different friction conditions. In this regards, several <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>tests</b> of cylindrical cups were conducted under four friction conditions at the tool–blank interface. The first case was the dry deep-drawing, considered as a reference friction condition, while in the other three cases hydraulic oil, lithium-based grease and animal fat were used as lubricants. For each friction case, three levels of blank holding force were adopted, namely 10, 20 and 25 kN. The finite element simulation of the deep-drawing process was used to generate a set of calibration curves. By overlapping the experimental load-stroke curves on the calibration curves, the friction coefficient was estimated for each friction case...|$|R
40|$|Economical and {{fuel-efficient}} {{vehicles are}} a current topic of interest worldwide, due to increasing fuel costs and environmental concerns. The most strident demand from various auto-sector stakeholders {{is to reduce}} emissions from vehicles and keep the environment clean. To solve this issue we need to reduce vehicle weight to lower fuel consumption. In this context, magnesium alloys {{can be considered as}} an alternative for sheet metal components, as they are 35 percent lighter than aluminium alloys and 78 percent lighter than steel. The AZ magnesium alloy series is widely used by the modern light metal industry. In this research, AZ 80 magnesium alloy was selected. AZ 80 is an important structural wrought-magnesium alloy with a high aluminium content of about 8 wt. %. AZ 80 is the main subject of this study because it offers higher strength and greater hardness than the more widely used AZ 31. In this research, magnesium AZ 80 alloys with two different grain sizes were considered, that is fine grain AZ 80 (grain size ≈ 10 µm) and coarse grain AZ 80 (grain size ≈ 60 µm). These grain sizes were chosen for investigations of the effect of grain size at higher temperatures and to observe changes in mechanical and forming capabilities with respect to grain size. To investigate the formability characteristics of magnesium alloys, various tensile tests and deep drawing tests were performed at different temperatures, test speeds and grain sizes {{to understand the nature of}} the material. Anisotropy of material, strain sensitivity index and flow stress were also determined by varying all of these parameters. Moreover, load-displacement diagrams, forming-limit diagrams and the effects of variations in various pre-and-post processing parameters were also examined. A further part of this research was to examine microstructure changes through the use of microscopic images at high magnification by utilising optical and scanning electron microscopes. It was observed that the microstructure of magnesium alloys was extremely sensitive to processing parameters in tensile <b>tests</b> and <b>deep-drawing</b> <b>tests.</b> The final part of the research was the verification of mathematical modelling and simulation of metal forming processes by using the commercial FEA software package Abaqus...|$|R
40|$|The work aims to {{characterize}} the quasi-static mechanical behavior of the Ti 6 Al 4 V titanium alloy at room temperature and to describe it by a phenomenological model. The thesis is divided in four parts. The first one presents a literature review of the basic properties of titanium and its alloys (crystal structure, classification, deformation mechanisms), then it focuses on the specific mechanical features of Ti 6 Al 4 V. It also proposes a state {{of art in the}} field of the phenomenological constitutive laws used to model the mechanical behaviors of metals. The second part deals with the experimental campaign conducted on a 0. 6 mm thick Ti 6 Al 4 V sheet. The devices and the tests are first described before giving the test results. The campaign includes experiments with monotonic and complex strain paths (tension, compression, simple shear, plane strain, Bauschinger <b>tests,</b> <b>deep-drawing</b> processes, layer compression tests). The experimental results show that the material displays anisotropy in yield stress, r-ratios and hardening, as well as a strength differential effect between tension and compression. The third part describes the implementation of the yield criteria CPB 06 exn in the non-linear finite element code LAGAMINE developed in MSM team. These criteria are selected to model the yield locus of Ti 6 Al 4 V since they are able to take into account both the anisotropy and the tension-compression asymmetry exhibited by the alloy. Several parameter identifications are performed using the classical simulated annealing algorithm. They determine that CPB 06 ex 2 is required to represent the yield surface. The criterion is next associated to different hardening formulations: (1) Voce isotropic law; (2) mixed Voce isotropic – Armstrong-Frederick kinematic law; (3) model taking into account the evolution of the yield locus shape with the deformation. The identification of the hardening parameters is achieved from the monotonic and Bauschinger tests either by inverse method, or by the simulated annealing method. The last part of the thesis proposed a validation of the different modelings {{in the case of the}} layer compression <b>tests</b> and the <b>deep-drawing</b> processes...|$|R
