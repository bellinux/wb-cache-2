5|$|Route 126 {{starts at}} the Kansas state line, where K-126 ends. The road travels east for around seven miles in a {{straight}} line, intersecting Route M and Route 43. Route 126 continues eastward, crossing through farmland and a few trees. After the route intersects Route J, it meets a frontage road parallel to I-49/US 71. The road crosses over North <b>Fork</b> <b>Spring</b> River and continues east. Soon, Route 126 intersects I-49/US 71 at a diamond interchange, and intersects a frontage road again. The route crosses a railroad owned by Missouri and Northern Arkansas Railroad, and intersects Routes JJ and T. Four miles later, the route enters Golden City and becomes Main Street. It becomes concurrent with Route 37. The routes goes through downtown Golden City, and turn slightly northeast. The two routes end at US 160 at a T-intersection. US 160 continues eastward toward Lockwood. In 2012, Missouri Department of Transportation (MoDOT) calculated as many as 840 vehicles traveling east of I-49/US 71, and as few as 480 vehicles traveling west of I-49/US 71. This is {{expressed in terms of}} annual average daily traffic (AADT), a measure of traffic volume for any average day of the year.|$|E
500|$|Spring Creek Debris Dam is an {{earthfill dam}} on Spring Creek, a {{tributary}} of the Sacramento River, in Shasta County in the U.S. state of California. Completed in 1963, the dam, maintained by the U.S. Bureau of Reclamation, serves primarily to collect severe acid mine drainage stemming from the Iron Mountain Mine. The dam forms the Spring Creek Reservoir, less than [...] long. Spring Creek and South <b>Fork</b> <b>Spring</b> Creek flow into the reservoir from a [...] watershed. The dam is directly upstream from the city of Keswick, California and the Keswick Reservoir.|$|E
500|$|Spring Creek is a southeast-flowing, [...] long {{tributary}} of the Sacramento River, receiving water from approximately [...] of land. The creek begins in the Klamath Mountains above the Sacramento River drainage, and flows in a generally south-east direction before turning south and sharply west into the Spring Creek Reservoir. From the reservoir, it continues due west until it empties directly into {{an arm of the}} Keswick Reservoir. The creek never actually runs by the mine. The acid mine drainage found in the creek is actually carried in by two smaller tributaries, which are Boulder Creek and Slickrock Creek. The former stream runs southeast from the north side of Iron Mountain Mine to Spring Creek, while the latter stream drains {{the south side of the}} mine and also flows southeast into Spring Creek. South <b>Fork</b> <b>Spring</b> Creek is a small tributary that flows west and north the Spring Creek Reservoir, but since its basin lies far from the mine, it receives no acid mine drainage. The inflow and outflow from the reservoir are highly erratic, ranging from [...] per second to roughly [...] per second in a particular 10-day period from March to April.|$|E
50|$|Front {{and rear}} {{suspensions}} {{were made by}} White Power (WP). Front suspensions (also known as forks) allow compression adjustment at the bottom as well as damping adjustments {{at the top of}} the <b>forks.</b> <b>Spring</b> preload can be adjusted by removing the top cap of the forks.|$|R
5000|$|Brake dive with {{telescopic}} forks can {{be reduced}} by either increasing the spring rate of the <b>fork</b> <b>springs,</b> orincreasing the compression damping of the forks. However, all of these changes make the motorcycle less pleasant to ride on rough roads, since the front end will feel stiffer, in the 1980s various manufacturers attempted to get round this by methods of anti-dive such as: ...|$|R

50|$|The BSA C15S was the motorcross {{competition}} {{version of}} the 250 cc Star produced between 1959 and 1965. As with the trials version, the C15S saved {{the weight of a}} battery through an 'energy transfer' electrical system which was notoriously unreliable. The problem was that the timing and points gap required far too much careful setting for a rugged competition motorcycle. The scrambler C15 was unsilenced and had special tyres and strengthened <b>fork</b> <b>springs</b> with rubber <b>fork</b> gaiters to protect the seals.|$|R
5000|$|The Spring River is a 57 mi long river which {{flows through}} the U.S. states of Missouri and Arkansas.
