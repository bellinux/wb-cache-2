25|$|Applying the <b>internal</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> {{method to}} {{maximize}} {{the value of the}} firm, any investment would be accepted, if its profitability, as measured by the <b>internal</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return,</b> is greater than a minimum acceptable rate of return. The appropriate minimum rate {{to maximize the}} value added to the firm is the cost of capital, i.e. the <b>internal</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> of a new capital project needs to be higher than the company's cost of capital.

After a correction for selection bias in our data, the regression <b>of</b> the buyout <b>internal</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> on the <b>internal</b> <b>rates</b> <b>of</b> <b>return</b> <b>of</b> the mimicking portfolio yields a positive and statistically significant alpha.

40|$|Aims: The study {{examines}} {{the effect of}} capital cost and operating cost on some selected quarries within North Central Nigeria. Study Design: Survey design was used in designing the questionnaire used for collecting data from the selected quarries. Study Area and Methodology: Twenty four quarries were selected in North- Central Nigeria for this study. Sixteen of these quarries were for commercial purposes while eight were for construction purposes. A total number of one hundred and fifty-five questionnaires were randomly distributed to the workers and managements of the various quarries {{to collect data on}} the quantity of granite rock blasted per month, cost of drilling accessories used, cost of explosives used, cost of maintenance of plant/equipment and cost of manpower. Net Present Value (NPV) and <b>Internal</b> <b>Rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>Returns</b> (IRR) were the two economic evaluation data analyses used for the study because they rely on the time value of money. Results: The result shows that Majok quarry, Cafon quarry, Rock bridge quarry, Academ quarry, Trans Engineering and Sinac granite quarry are not doing well as their <b>internal</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> falls short <b>of</b> the annual <b>internal</b> <b>rate</b> <b>of</b> <b>returns</b> <b>of</b> 20 %. This indicates that the companies could not break even as they failed to cover the average operating cost.
