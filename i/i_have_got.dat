I don't think it is the role of the BBC to spend my money on a moral purpose." ...|$|E

In a letter quoted by Elizabeth Gaskell in her book The Life of Charlotte Brontë, Charlotte wrote: [...] "My dear husband, too, appears in a new light in his own country. More than once I have had deep {{pleasure}} in hearing his praises on all sides. Some of the old servants and followers of the family tell me I am a most fortunate person; for that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> one of the best gentlemen in the country ....

500|$|Paul Maurice Kelly [...] (born 13 January 1955) is an Australian {{rock music}} singer-songwriter, guitarist, and {{harmonica}} player. He has performed solo, and has led numerous groups, including the Dots, the Coloured Girls, and the Messengers. He {{has worked with}} other artists and groups, including associated projects Professor Ratbaggy and Stardust Five. Kelly's music style has ranged from bluegrass to studio-oriented dub reggae, but his core output straddles folk, rock, and country. His lyrics capture {{the vastness of the}} culture and landscape of Australia by chronicling life about him for over 30 years. David Fricke from Rolling Stone calls Kelly [...] "one of the finest songwriters I have ever heard, Australian or otherwise." [...] Kelly has said, [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> it nailed yet".|$|E
500|$|Back in London, Fleming had his manuscript—which he {{described}} as his [...] "dreadful oafish opus"—retyped by Joan Howe, his red-haired secretary at The Times on whom the character Miss Moneypenny was partly based. Clare Blanchard, a former girlfriend, advised him not to publish the book, {{or at least to}} do so under a pseudonym. During the book's final draft stages, Fleming allowed his friend, and later editor, William Plomer to see a copy, and remarked [...] "I really am thoroughly ashamed of it... after rifling through this muck you will probably never speak to me again, but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to take that chance." [...] Despite this, Plomer thought the book had sufficient promise and sent a copy to the publishing house Jonathan Cape. At first they were unenthusiastic, but were persuaded to publish on the recommendation of Fleming's older brother, Peter, an established travel writer whose books they managed.|$|E

500|$|Given the UFA's formal {{adoption}} of the goal of replacing Stewart's Liberal government with a Farmer government, it remained surprisingly friendly towards the Premier. While campaigning for Moore during the Cochrane by-election, Wood called Stewart [...] "an honourable, upright citizen, doing {{the best he could}} under difficult circumstances" [...] and boasted that [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to tear down the character of an honourable man to build up something that I want, I am not going to build it up." [...] When at last the general election came, in 1921, the UFA declined to run a candidate in Stewart's Sedgewick riding as a sign of respect to the Premier. After the UFA swept to victory, there was even speculation that Stewart, still a UFA member, would stay on as Premier of a new Farmer's government (as part of its opposition to [...] "old style politics," [...] the UFA had contested the election without designating a leader), but he announced otherwise.|$|E
500|$|Luton manager Ray Harford {{had doubts}} over his team {{selection}} for the final. Though {{buoyed by the}} return of David Preece and Ricky Hill to full training, he was without Darron McDonough who injured his knee ligaments in training. Harford said the instability presented a selection dilemma, telling reporters: [...] "I think <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to break somebody's heart by telling him he is not playing." [...] He admitted Luton's poor run of form since losing the Full Members Cup was a reason why he would make changes for the Wembley final, and noted his side's difficulty on grass away from home. Harford identified David Rocastle as Arsenal's biggest threat and felt they had few weaknesses in the side other than the ability to finish chances. He believed O'Leary absence through injury was a big loss for Arsenal, and implied that Williams was needed in midfield: [...] "Without him they don't have a leader. He has a presence and that Wembley flair." ...|$|E

500|$|While Thomas Killingbeck, a compositor, and Peter Bishop, a proofreader, {{were working}} for Richardson in his print shop during 1753, Richardson {{discovered}} that printers in Dublin had copies of The History of Sir Charles Grandison and began printing the novel before the English edition was to be published. Richardson suspected that they were involved with the unauthorized distribution of the novel and promptly fired them. Immediately following the firing, Richardson wrote to Lady Bradshaigh, 19 October 1753: [...] "the Want of the same Ornaments, or Initial Letters , in each Vol. will help to discover them , although they should put the Booksellers Names that I have affixed. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> some Friends to write down to Scotland, to endeavour to seize their Edition, if offered to be imported". [...] There were four Dublin presses used to make unauthorized copies the novel, {{but none of them}} were able to add the ornaments that could effectively mimic Richardson's own. However, there were still worries about the unlicensed copies, and Richardson relied on seven additional printers to speed up the production of Grandison.|$|E
500|$|Fellow {{songwriter}} Neil Finn (Crowded House) has said, [...] "There {{is something}} unique and powerful {{about the way}} Kelly mixes up everyday detail with the big issues of life, death, love and struggle – not a trace of pretence or fakery in there". Ross Clelland, writing for Rolling Stone, described Kelly: [...] "hile he was (rightly) lauded {{for his ability to}} sing of injustice without ranting, or deal with the darker sides of human nature non-judgementally, often overlooked was the fact he could write a damn fine melodic hook to go with those words". Tim Freedman (The Whitlams) acknowledges Kelly, Peter Garrett (Midnight Oil), and John Schumann (Redgum) as inspiring him by [...] " [...] our suburbs with our own myths and social history". However, Kelly has been quoted as saying [...] "Song writing is mysterious to me. I still feel like a total beginner. I don't feel like <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> it nailed yet". In 2007 Kelly donated his 'Lee Oskar' harmonica to the Sydney Powerhouse Museum. The museum's statement of significance cites Kelly's talent as a songwriter, his distinctive voice, and his harmonica playing, particularly on Live, May 1992.|$|E
500|$|At the {{beginning}} of Series 5, set {{three months after the}} birth, Rachel appears overprotective of Matthew; she refuses to let Adam hold him and never lets him out of her sight. After Adam abruptly leaves Matthew's naming ceremony, feeling unable to love his child because he is coming between him and his wife, Rachel reveals that the baby fell off the kitchen table when she left him unattended for a matter of seconds. Baxendale said of the story, [...] "Rachel's take on motherhood is quite real in my experience because she's had such trouble conceiving for a start and then all the problems with the birth [...] She becomes obsessed with the baby and excludes Adam from everything. They have to work hard to resolve their differences and there is a big transition. I can see why she behaves the way she does—you do become over-protective with a baby. It's amazing what your body does to you and the instincts that suddenly take over. Being a mum myself, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> real empathy with Rachel."

500|$|Verity never {{spun the}} ball very far, {{particularly}} after his second tour to Australia, and preferred {{to concentrate on}} bowling a good length. However, critics {{did not think that}} Verity posed enough of a threat to batsmen and could be dull to watch. By the middle of his career, he had a reputation for being ineffective on good batting pitches, and was occasionally dropped from the England team for his lack of effectiveness. Even so, he only missed one Test against Australia and one against South Africa, the two strongest Test playing teams, after he made his debut. Verity believed his performances in unfavourable conditions for his bowling had greater merit than his successes in favourable ones. He once said: [...] "Do not praise me when I have taken 8 for 20 on a sticky wicket, but when <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> 2 for 100 on a perfect wicket." [...] At times, Verity almost seemed bored when bowling and performed less effectively, particularly if his side were winning without needing his contribution. Bowes once told the Yorkshire captain, Brian Sellers, that the way to get the best out of Verity was to tell him that everything depended on him.|$|E
500|$|His first {{published}} song, [...] "It's the Falling Apart that Makes You", was written {{after listening to}} Van Morrison's Astral Weeks {{at the age of}} 19, although in an interview with Drum Media he recalled writing his first unpublished song: [...] "It was an open-tuning and had four lines about catching trains. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> a recording of it somewhere. It was called 'Catching a Train'. I wrote a lot of songs about trains early on, trains and fires, and then I moved on to water". In 1976, Kelly appeared on Debutantes, a compilation album featuring [...] various Melbourne-based artists, and joined pub-rockers The High Rise Bombers from 1977 to 1978. The High Rise Bombers included Kelly (vocals, guitar, songwriter), Martin Armiger (guitar, vocals, songwriter), Lee Cass (bass guitar), Chris Dyson (guitar), Sally Ford (saxophone, songwriter), John Lloyd (drums), and Keith Shadwick (saxophone). Chris Langman (guitar, vocals) replaced Dyson in early 1978. In August, after Armiger left for The Sports and Ford for The Kevins, Kelly formed Paul Kelly and the Dots with Langman and Lloyd. The High Rise Bombers recorded two tracks, [...] "She's Got It" [...] and [...] "Domestic Criminal", which appeared on The Melbourne Club, a 1981 compilation by various artists on Missing Link Records.|$|E
500|$|A reunion {{episode was}} speculated after the fifth series ended; in the 2003 {{documentary}} Cold Feet: The Final Call, executive producer Andy Harries stated, [...] "By killing a character, you are truly saying 'this series is over' … until, of course, in 10 years time when money {{is running a}} bit short for all of us, we bring it back. What we do with Rachel, I don't know yet—but <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> a few theories." [...] In an interview published in October 2003, Harries told The Daily Telegraph that ITV would [...] "probably" [...] bring back Cold Feet ten years after it ended, and said, [...] "There's a tacit understanding with the actors that we will re-visit it again at the appropriate time." [...] In 2007, a tabloid newspaper quoted an ITV [...] "insider" [...] as saying that a reunion episode would be broadcast to mark ten years since the pilot aired. The report {{turned out to be}} a fabrication. At the 2010 Edinburgh International Television Festival, Harries stated that discussions about the series' return were [...] "ongoing", but highlighted a number of factors that would prevent a reunion in the near future. The following day, Harries told Kate Silverton that he had held discussions with Mike Bullen about the series returning, but that it would not be back on television screens in 2011 or 2012.|$|E

500|$|In 1756, Dr. John Wall {{published}} a 14-page pamphlet {{on the benefits}} of Malvern water, that reached a 158-page 3rd edition in 1763. Further praise came from the botanist Benjamin Stillingfleet in 1757, the poet Thomas Warton in 1790, quoted in a review by the medical historian W.H. McMenemy. Cure tourism in Malvern got press mention. In a letter dated 18 July 1759 to Mrs Montague, Benjamin Stillingfleet wrote: [...] "I have been at Malvern about twelve days, where, with difficulty, <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> a lodging, the place is so full, nor do I wonder at it, there being some instances of very extraordinary cures, in cases looked on as desperate, even by Dr. Wall, who first brought these waters into vogue...The road is very fine, and made on purpose for the convenience of the drinkers". Chambers, in a footnote to the [...] "song" [...] quoted above, wrote [...] "Though modern visitors do not now lie in bushes, yet so crowded was Malvern one season that a lady of rank and fashion, with her equipage and servants were actually obliged to be sent to the Workhouse. It is now the custom, during the season, to let out this house to visitors, and the money gained this way is applied to the funds for maintaining the poor." [...] Nicholas Vansittart brought his wife Catherine to Malvern for a rest cure in 1809. In 1828, William Addison, the physician of The Duchess of Kent (mother of Queen Victoria) lectured about Malvern at the Royal Institution commending [...] "its pure and invigorating air, the excellence of its water, and the romantic beauty of its scenery".|$|E
500|$|The {{battle plan}} called for a {{combination}} of naval bombardments and an amphibious landing. The initial attempt was called off after adverse currents hampered the assault and {{the element of surprise}} was lost. Nelson immediately ordered another assault but this was beaten back. He prepared for a third attempt, to take place during the night. Although he personally led one of the battalions, the operation ended in failure: the Spanish were better prepared than had been expected and had secured strong defensive positions. Several of the boats failed to land at the correct positions in the confusion, while those that did were swept by gunfire and grapeshot. Nelson's boat reached its intended landing point but as he stepped ashore he was hit in the right arm by a musketball, which fractured his humerus bone in multiple places. He was rowed back to Theseus to be attended to by the surgeon, Thomas Eshelby. On arriving at his ship he refused to be helped aboard, declaring [...] "Let me alone! <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> my legs left and one arm." [...] He was taken to surgeon Eshelby, instructing him to prepare his instruments and [...] "the sooner it was off the better". Most of the right arm was amputated and within half an hour Nelson had returned to issuing orders to his captains. Years later he would excuse himself to Commodore John Thomas Duckworth for not writing longer letters due to not being naturally left-handed. He developed the sensation of phantom limb in his lost arm later on and declared that he had [...] "found the direct evidence of the existence of soul".|$|E
500|$|With Somerset runners-up in the English 2009 Twenty20 Cup, Trescothick and his county {{travelled}} to India {{to partake}} in the Champions League Twenty20 in October. Though both Kieswetter and Hildreth were anticipated as successes, it was Trescothick who {{was described as}} having [...] "been in sparkling form all season" [...] and began the tournament under media scrutiny given his previous difficulties playing on tour. There was much speculation regarding any [...] "recurrence of his stress-related illness that originally occurred in 2006", as {{this was to be}} his first overseas outing since an aborted attempt in 2008. Trescothick himself responded to the media by making a statement to the BBC World Service which read [...] "I know the risk and I know what happens when it goes wrong. In the last couple of times I have tried to go on tour it's failed, so of course ... Let's try and break the tradition of what has happened over the last few times... I can only try. It's a big competition for the players and for the club. <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>got</b> to try and make it happen." [...] Meanwhile, Langer assured the media that Trescothick could pull out whenever he wished to. Somerset, who began the tour without Trescothick as he was arriving later than most of the squad, commenced their warm up with a victory over the Otago Volts. The opener arrived three days later, confident in his ability to complete the tour. Somerset began with a close victory against the Deccan Chargers on 10 October, winning from the last ball. Trescothick was dismissed for 14 from 12 in his first match outside England since 2006, [...] "after offering a fleeting glimpse of his talent" [...] according to ESPNcricinfo.|$|E
