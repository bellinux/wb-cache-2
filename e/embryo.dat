5|$|Although the {{presence}} of an <b>embryo</b> per se would be equivocal regarding this issue, the conditions in which the <b>embryo</b> were preserved provide strong evidence that Dinocephalosaurus was viviparous. There is no preserved calcified eggshell surrounding the <b>embryo,</b> despite {{the presence}} of delicately-preserved calcified elements from other animals at Luoping. This is consistent with the eggshells surrounding the embryos of viviparous reptiles being non-calcified membranes. Furthermore, the relative proportions of the humerus and the fibula in the <b>embryo,</b> compared with the maternal individual and IVPP V13898 from Panxian, indicate that the <b>embryo</b> is around 12% of the size of its mother. Combined with its ossified bones, this suggests that the <b>embryo</b> was at an advanced developmental stage, whereas crocodilians, birds, turtles, and tuataras lay eggs at very early developmental stages.|$|E

Methods: <b>Embryos</b> were collected from immature C 57 BL 6 female mice superovulated with pregnant mare serum gonadotropin and human chorionic gonadotropin and mated by CD 1 males. Groups of 1, 5, 10, or 20 <b>embryos</b> were cultured in 5 -, 10 -, 20 -, or 40 -mul drops of CZB under silicon oil at 37. 5 -degrees-C in a humidified atmosphere of 5 % CO 2 and 95 % air. Results: Development score for <b>embryos</b> cultured in 10 mul was higher than that of <b>embryos</b> cultured in 20 or 40 mul. <b>Embryos</b> cultured in groups of 5, 10, or 20 had higher development scores than <b>embryos</b> cultured singly.

5|$|Such a {{cascading}} regulatory {{network has}} been studied in detail {{in the development of}} the fruit fly <b>embryo.</b> The young <b>embryo</b> is oval in shape, like a rugby ball. A small number of genes produce messenger RNAs that set up concentration gradients along the long axis of the <b>embryo.</b> In the early <b>embryo,</b> the bicoid and hunchback genes are at high concentration near the anterior end, and give pattern to the future head and thorax; the caudal and nanos genes are at high concentration near the posterior end, and give pattern to the hindmost abdominal segments. The effects of these genes interact; for instance, the Bicoid protein blocks the translation of caudals messenger RNA, so the Caudal protein concentration becomes low at the anterior end. Caudal later switches on genes which create the fly's hindmost segments, but only at the posterior end where it is most concentrated.|$|E

5|$|A small {{fraction}} of the genes in an organism's genome control the organism's development. These genes are called the developmental-genetic toolkit. They are highly conserved among phyla, meaning that they are ancient and very similar in widely separated groups of animals. Differences in deployment of toolkit genes affect the body plan and the number, identity, and pattern of body parts. Most toolkit genes are parts of signalling pathways: they encode transcription factors, cell adhesion proteins, cell surface receptor proteins and signalling ligands that bind to them, and secreted morphogens that diffuse through the <b>embryo.</b> All of these help to define the fate of undifferentiated cells in the <b>embryo.</b> Together, they generate the patterns in time and space which shape the <b>embryo,</b> and ultimately form the body plan of the organism.
