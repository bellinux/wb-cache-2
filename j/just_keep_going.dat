[...] In September 2015, Hedlund stated that he was told that the third Tron film was not [...] "totally dead", but jokingly suggested that it could be released 30 years later, referencing the near 30-year gap between the first film and Legacy.|$|E

Vocalist Brandon Boyd noted, [...] "It's not that we were burned out being in a band or being in this band; I think that we, collectively, were feeling like if we didn't step away from this monster that we created then it would begin to consume us. [...] We had to plant some roots, lest we start to write songs about living on a tour bus. So we had to fall in love, we had to fall out of love, we had to make homes." [...] Guitarist Michael Einziger elaborated further, [...] "It just got to this point where we had been going strong for such {{a long period of time}} that we really accomplished all of our goals. [...] It was like, 'Ok, well what do we do now?' Obviously there are lots of things to do but I think we wanted to take some time, each of us personally, to explore a little bit and find out what the rest of the world was like." [...] Bassist Ben Kenney stated, [...] "Being with music is a creative thing and requires a certain amount of creativity - to <b>just</b> <b>keep</b> <b>going</b> back to that well over and over again, it doesn’t have a chance to replenish." ...|$|E

Grant praised Carell's improvisational skills—noting that [...] "he <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>going</b> off script [...] is channeling something"—as well as Wilson's humorous antics while acting.

5000|$|The game inevitably ends {{when all}} six cities are destroyed, unless the player manages to score enough points {{to earn a}} bonus city {{before the end of}} the level. Like most early arcade games, there is no way to [...] "win" [...] the game; the game <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>going</b> with ever-faster and more {{prolific}} incoming missiles. The game, then, is just a contest in seeing how long the player can survive. On conclusion of the game, the screen displays [...] "The End", rather than [...] "Game Over", signifying that [...] "n the end, all is lost. There is no winner." [...] This conclusion is skipped, however, if the player makes the high score list and the game prompts the player to enter his/her initials.|$|R
2500|$|The {{magazine}} wrote, [...] "In fact, the LFA hits 100 mph four-tenths {{faster than}} the GT-R — and <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>going.</b> As both flash past the quarter-mile marker, the LFA never looks back". The magazine also found the LFA to be superior in dynamic handling. Regarding challenges in launching the LFA with its automated transmission without having {{the ability to use}} its launch control, Motor Trend noted, [...] "It works, but not all of the time. A great launch means only a chirp of the tires and blistering acceleration, but vary the rpm just bit and the LFA torches its rubber before rocketing down the strip. A slight delay between paddle actuation and SMG response further complicates a fast start." [...] Motor Trend awarded the win in this comparison to Lexus LFA.|$|R

5000|$|Speaking of the album's {{creation}} process, Thicke told Billboard “I had no {{idea what}} I was doing while I was doing it. I just made decisions based on what sounds good and feels good.

5000|$|Moog {{commented on}} the album's success: [...] "CBS {{had no idea what}} they had in Switched-On Bach. When it came out, they lumped it in at a studio press party for Terry Riley's In C and an abysmal record called Rock and Other Four Letter Words. Carlos was angered by this, so he refused to come. So CBS, frantic to have some representation, asked me to {{demonstrate}} the synthesizer. I remember there was a nice big bowl of joints on top of the mixing console, and Terry Riley was there in his white Jesus suit, up on a pedestal, playing live on a Farfisa electronic organ against a backup of tape delays. Rock and Other Four Letter Words went on to sell a few thousand records. In C sold a few tens of thousands. Switched-On Bach sold over a million, and <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>going</b> on and on.".|$|R

[...] David Gordon, reviewing for the nytheatre of the 2008 WorkShop Theater Company production wrote: [...] "McNally certainly has a way with words and captures the essence of these women as if he's known them his entire life. Yet, despite the Pulitzer nomination, I don't think Ganesh is the best play in his canon. The play is overwrought and overlong; most of the scenes in the second act end {{in such a way that}} you feel they can be a satisfying closer to the play, yet it <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>going...</b> 'A Perfect Ganesh', is certainly a bit of McNally's response to the AIDS crisis." ...|$|R

It's very static. It's all about the same frequency of reward and existence, and it <b>just</b> <b>keeps</b> <b>going</b> {{on and on and on}} and on. Hell is much more dynamic...the main character's presumption is that hell has to be varied, otherwise punishment is no longer effective, because it becomes familiar. So hell has to be something where your punishment surprises you, and part of your punishment is that there is no getting used to things because you never know what will happen next. That's a very simplified version, but that's one of the main differences. So hell is quite dynamic and changing. It's very feudal. It's very much about 'whoever has the power makes the rules.' In heaven that's true also, but you don't know who made the rules. The rules have all been made and they're not changing." ...|$|R
