5000|$|The term {{deductive}} {{distinguishes the}} DN model's intended determinism from the probabilism of inductive inferences.

50|$|Judgments {{are used}} for example in formalizing {{deduction}} systems: a logical axiom expresses a judgment, premises of a rule of inference are formed as a sequence of judgments, and their conclusion is a judgment as well. Also {{the result of a}} proof expresses a judgment, and the used hypotheses are formed as a sequence of judgments. A characteristic feature of the variants of Hilbert-style deduction systems is that the context is not changed in any of their rules of inference, while both natural deduction and sequent calculus contain some context-changing rules. Thus, if we are interested only in the <b>derivability</b> of tautologies, not hypothetical judgments, then we can formalize the Hilbert-style deduction system {{in such a way that}} its rules of inference contain only judgments of a rather simple form.

50|$|Provability {{logic is}} a modal logic, {{in which the}} box {{operator}} is interpreted as 'it is provable that'. The point is to capture {{the notion of a}} proof predicate of a reasonably rich formal theory. As basic axioms of the provability logic GL (Gödel-Löb), which captures provable in Peano Arithmetic, one takes modal analogues of the Hilbert-Bernays <b>derivability</b> conditions and Löb's theorem (if it is provable that the provability of A implies A, then A is provable).|$|E

This motivated Arthur Eddington (1929) to construct an argument why its value might be 1/137 precisely, which related to the Eddington number, his estimate of the number of protons in the Universe. By the 1940s, {{it became clear that the}} value of the fine-structure constant deviates significantly from the precise value of 1/137, refuting Eddington's argument.|$|E
50|$|Fodor {{used this}} {{generalized}} multiple realizability thesis {{to argue against}} reductionism {{of the mind and}} of the special sciences. The key to Fodor's argument is that, in his characterization of reductionism, all mental kind predicates in an ideal and completed psychology must correspond with a physical kind predicate in an ideal and completed physics. He suggested taking Ernest Nagel's theory of reduction, which insisted on the <b>derivability</b> of all terms in the theory to be reduced from terms in the reducing theory and the bridging laws, as the canonical theory of reduction. Given generalized multiple realizability, the physical science part of these psychophysical bridge laws will end up being a (possibly infinite) disjunction of all the terms referring to possible physical realizations of a mental kind. This disjunction cannot be a kind-predicate and therefore the entire statement cannot be a law of physics. The special sciences cannot be reduced to physics in this way, according to Fodor.|$|E
5000|$|As {{conventionally}} {{conceived by}} philosophers of science, scientific explanation of a phenomenon was simply epistemic (concerning knowledge), and {{centered on the}} phenomenon's counterfactual <b>derivability</b> from initial conditions plus natural laws (Hempel's covering law model). [...] Yet Salmon found causality ubiquitous in scientific explanation, which identifies not only natural laws (empirical regularities), but accounts for them via nature's structure and thereby involves the ontic (concerning reality), how the phenomenon [...] "fits into the causal nexus" [...] of the world (Salmon's causal/mechanical explanation). [...] For instance, Boyle's law relates temperature, pressure, and volume of an ideal gas (epistemic), but this was later reduced to laws of statistical mechanics via average kinetic energy of colliding molecules composing the gas (ontic). [...] Thus, Salmon finds scientific explanation to be not merely nomological—that is, lawlike—but rather ontological, or causal/mechanical. [...] Though asserting the primacy of causal/mechanical explanation, Salmon was vague as to how scientists can attain it. [...] Still, consensus among philosophers of science is that causation is central in scientific explanation.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. We give an {{overview}} of results, presented {{in the form of}} a poster at CSL 03 /KGC, about a general study of the notions of rule <b>derivability</b> and admissibility in Hilbert-style proof systems. The basis of our investigation consists in the concept of “abstract Hilbert system”, a framework for Hilbert-style proof systems in which it is abstracted from the syntax of formulas and the operational content of rules. We Hilbert systems, propose two variant notions of rule <b>derivability,</b> s-derivability and m-derivability, and investigate how these four notions are related. Furthermore, we consider relations that compare abstract Hilbert systems with respect to rule admissibility or with respect to one of the three notions of rule <b>derivability,</b> and study their interrelations.

Next the interpolation theorem and the parallel interpolation theorem over Horn formulas under classical propositional <b>derivability</b> was formulated.

40|$|We {{define the}} {{semantics}} of logic programs with (abstract) constraint atoms {{in a way}} closely tied to default logic. Like default logic formulas in rules are evaluated using the classical entailment relation, so a constraint atom can be represented by an equivalent propositional formula. Therefore, answer sets are defined in a way closely related to default extensions. The semantics defined this way enjoys two properties generally considered desirable for answer set programming - minimality and <b>derivability.</b> The <b>derivability</b> property is very important because it guarantees free of self-supporting, loops in answer sets. We show that a when restricted to basic logic programs, this semantics agrees with the conditional-satisfaction based semantics. Furthermore, answer sets by the minimal-model based semantics can be recast in our approach. Consequently, the default, approach gives a unifying account of the major existing semantics for logic programs with constraint atoms.
