5|$|Grevillea juniperina, {{commonly}} known as juniper- or juniper-leaf grevillea or prickly spider-flower, is a plant of the family Proteaceae native to eastern New South Wales and south-eastern Queensland in Australia. Scottish botanist Robert Brown described the species in 1810, and seven subspecies are recognised. One subspecies, G. j. juniperina, is restricted to Western Sydney and environs and <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> loss of habitat and housing development.|$|E
5|$|Like many Australian {{cockatoos}} and parrots, the red-tailed black cockatoo <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the thriving {{illegal trade}} in bird smuggling. High demand and high transit mortality mean {{that many more}} birds are taken from the wild than actually sold.|$|E
5|$|Petter's big-footed mouse is {{now found}} only in the Mikea Forest of southwestern Madagascar, but subfossil records {{indicate}} that {{it used to be}} more widely distributed in southern Madagascar. Climatic changes and competition with introduced species may have led to the shift in its distribution. The Mikea Forest, the only place where it is still known to occur, <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> human development.|$|E

5|$|The Andean condor is a {{national}} symbol of Argentina, Bolivia, Chile, Colombia, Ecuador, and Peru and {{plays an important role}} in the folklore and mythology of the Andean regions. The Andean condor is considered near threatened by the IUCN. It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss and by secondary poisoning from carcasses killed by hunters. Captive breeding programs have been instituted in several countries.|$|E

5|$|This bird is {{classified}} as vulnerable by the IUCN and <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat destruction. Since the arid, spiny forests in which it lives are not protected by the Malagasy government, it is losing habitat to slash-and-burn agriculture, charcoal collection, and logging. It is also hunted by the native peoples of Madagascar.|$|E
5|$|Today, the {{existence}} of kulintang music <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the influence of globalization, {{and the introduction of}} Western and foreign ideals into the region.

5|$|A {{declared}} vulnerable species, {{it occurs}} in two disjunct populations on granite outcrops along the south coast of Western Australia, with the main population near Albany and a smaller population near Walpole, and <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> dieback (Phytophthora cinnamomi) and aerial canker (Zythiostroma). B. verticillata is killed by bushfire and new plants regenerate from seed afterwards. Populations take over a decade to produce seed and fire intervals of greater than twenty years are needed to allow the canopy seed bank to accumulate.|$|E
5|$|Along {{with the}} Lundy cabbage, Psylliodes luridipennis has been {{listed in the}} United Kingdom Biodiversity Action Plan, and an action plan for its {{conservation}}, along with the conservation of other endemic species, has been prepared. This plan revolves mostly around the control of Rhododendron ponticum, an alien species which threatens the Lundy cabbage. The beetle <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> fluctuating numbers of Lundy cabbages. Though it is quicker than P. napi to recolonise new growth after bad years for the cabbage, it is slower to recover than the cabbage itself.|$|E
5|$|Although it is a mimid, {{the black}} catbird {{is not known}} to imitate any other species. Its song {{is a mix of}} harsh notes and clear flute-like whistles, with the phrases repeated. It builds a cup nest in low bushes or trees, and lays two bluish eggs. It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss, and has been {{assessed}} as near threatened by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature.|$|E

Gaius allies himself with the Ascians, an immortal cult determined to awaken an evil deity that threatens all of Hydaelyn. The Beastmen tribes also threaten the unstable peace in Eorzea with their summoning of primals, aetherial deities who deplete the land of its lifeblood.|$|E
5|$|Fossil {{evidence}} shows the golden white-eye once also occurred on Tinian and Rota but was extirpated in those locations through {{the impact of}} human activities. Despite its current abundance on Saipan and Aguijan, {{and the fact that}} it has among the highest recorded densities for any bird, it is nevertheless considered to be critically endangered. It <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the invasive brown tree snake, which has become established on nearby Guam, and this predator is expected to cause a rapid decline in the population if it reaches Saipan. Efforts are under way to control the snakes and breed the white-eye in zoos.|$|E
5|$|Four-horned antelopes tend {{to inhabit}} areas with {{significant}} grass cover or heavy undergrowth, and avoid human settlements. Earlier common throughout deciduous forests in India, the antelope now occurs in widely disjunct, small populations. Most of the populations are in India, and lower numbers {{can be found}} in adjoining Nepal. The four-horned antelope <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> the loss of its natural habitat due to agricultural expansion. Moreover, the unusual four-horned skull and the horns have been a popular target for trophy hunters. The four-horned antelope is classified as Vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN).|$|E

5|$|G. juniperina subsp. juniperina – is {{endemic to}} Western Sydney, {{restricted}} to clay soils from Blacktown west to Penrith and Marsden Park and north to Pitt Town. It {{is listed as}} a vulnerable species on Schedule 2 of the Threatened Species Conservation Act 1995 in New South Wales. Its habitat <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> housing development, road upgrading, inappropriate fire regimes, weed invasion, rubbish dumping and trampling either by people or cars. It grows as a spreading shrub that is 0.5–1.5m (1.5–5ft) high.|$|E
5|$|Its {{inaccessible}} {{habitat and}} retiring nature {{mean that the}} snoring rail is rarely seen and little is known of its behaviour. Only the adult plumage has been described, and the breeding behaviour is unrecorded. It feeds on small crabs and probably other small prey such as lizards. Although protected under Indonesian law since 1972, the rail <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> habitat loss (even within nature reserves), hunting for food and predation by introduced species; it is therefore evaluated as Vulnerable on the IUCN Red List of Threatened Species.|$|E
5|$|Krüper's {{nuthatch}} <b>is</b> <b>threatened</b> <b>by</b> urbanisation {{and development}} in and around mature coniferous forests, particularly in the Mediterranean coastal areas where the species was once numerous. A law promoting tourism came into force in Turkey in 2003, further exacerbating the threats to their habitat. The law reduced bureaucracy and {{made it easier for}} developers to build tourism facilities and summer houses in the coastal zone where woodland loss is a growing problem for the nuthatch.|$|E
