40|$|We {{develop a}} linear {{algebraic}} {{framework for the}} shape-from-shading problem, because tensors arise when scalar (e. g. image) and vector (e. g. surface normal) fields are differentiated multiple times. The work is in two parts. In this first part we investigate when image derivatives exhibit invariance to changing <b>illumination</b> <b>by</b> calculating the statistics of image derivatives under general distributions on the light source. We computationally validate the hypothesis that image orientations (derivatives) provide increased invariance to <b>illumination</b> <b>by</b> showing (for a Lambertian model) that a shape-from-shading algorithm matching gradients instead of intensities provides more accurate reconstructions when illumination is incorrectly estimated under a flatness prior...|$|R

30|$|In summary, it is {{difficult}} to utilize an SLM to generate a certain multi-spectral projection efficiently. However, it may be feasible for multi-spectral random illumination, which is the focus of this study. To improve the performance of SLM-based phase retrieval, Chen et al. [13] generated the random <b>illumination</b> <b>by</b> a designed phase pattern which can eliminate the zeroth-order beam and let the light be more evenly distributed. While, this method is only for the single-wavelength random illuminate. Inspired by this approach, we generate the multi-spectral random <b>illumination</b> <b>by</b> designing the phase pattern of SLM. According to our investigation, this is the first research generating the multi-spectral random illumination using an LC-SLM without time-division or spacial-division methods.|$|R
