40|$|Abstract. The rapid loss of {{biodiversity}} due to <b>habitat</b> degradation <b>and</b> over exploitation has necessitated the conservation prioritization of <b>habitats,</b> species <b>and</b> communities for conservation. The prioritization of <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> communities through {{qualitative and quantitative}} assessment of vegetation is prerequisite for initiating any conservation and management programme. Therefore, an attempt has been made to; (i) identify the <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> communities; (ii) evaluate <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> communities for species richness, native, endemic, economically important and threatened species; (iii) prioritize <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> communities for conservation. Fifteen (15) <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> fourteen forest (14) communities distributed between 2490 - 4000 m were recorded. Overall, 35. 71 % communities were broad-leaved, 57. 14 % coniferous and 7. 14 % mixed. The <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> communities have been evaluated for the species richness, native, endemic, economically important and threatened species. Based on these attributes <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> communities have been prioritized. Among communities Abies pindrow- Pinus wallichiana mixed, Fraxinus xanthoxyloides, Picea smithiana- Pinus wallichiana mixed and Cedrus deodara-Acer cappadocicum mixed showed highest CPI <b>and</b> <b>habitats</b> forest, shady moist showed highest CPI value. Regular monitoring of the prioritized <b>habitats</b> <b>and</b> communities has been suggested. Also, mass scale propagation of native, endemic, economically important and threatene...|$|R

5|$|Starfish are in {{some cases}} taken from their <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> sold to {{tourists}} as souvenirs, ornaments, curios or for display in aquariums. In particular, Oreaster reticulatus, with its easily accessed <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> conspicuous coloration, is widely collected in the Caribbean. In the early to mid 20th century, this species was common along the coasts of the West Indies, but collection and trade have severely reduced its numbers. In the State of Florida, O. reticulatus is listed as endangered and its collection is illegal. Nevertheless, it is still sold throughout its range and beyond. A similar phenomenon exists in the Indo-Pacific for species such as Protoreaster nodosus.|$|E

5|$|A {{hurricane}} in 1844 {{is said to}} have {{wiped out}} the population of Cuban macaws from Pinar del Río. Subsequent hurricanes in 1846 and 1856 further destroyed their habitat in western Cuba and scattered the remaining population. In addition, a tropical storm hit the Zapata Swamp in 1851. With a healthy macaw population, such events could have been beneficial by creating suitable habitat. However, given the species' precarious position, it may have resulted in fragmented <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> caused them to seek food in areas where they were more vulnerable to hunting.|$|E

5|$|Before Donald Pattie's {{research}} {{during the}} late 1960s, when his team studied marsh shrews in captivity, little was known about their behavior.

The Montagu's harriers did not return, but marsh harriers did, and the RSPB commenced improving the <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> facilities, including embanking the lagoons and building a car park and visitor centre. Avocets, then still very rare in the UK, first bred here in 1984. The visitor centre facilities were improved between 1987 and 1989 {{to cope with the}} numbers of visitors.|$|E

Some species indicate undisturbed <b>habitat,</b> <b>and</b> some indicate degraded habitat. Although caddisflies may be found in waterbodies of varying qualities, species-rich caddisfly assemblages are generally thought to indicate clean water bodies, such as lakes, ponds, and marshes. Together with stoneflies and mayflies, caddisflies feature importantly in bioassessment surveys of streams and other water bodies.|$|E

However, in regions where the sylvatic <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> its fauna are thinned by economic exploitation and human habitation, such as in newly deforested areas, piassava palm culture areas, and some parts of the Amazon region, a human transmission cycle may develop as the insects search for new food sources.|$|E
5|$|Destruction and {{encroachment}} {{of habitat}} by humans is another threat to loggerhead sea turtles. Optimum nesting beaches are open-sand beaches above the high-tide line. However, beach development deprives them of suitable nesting areas, {{forcing them to}} nest closer to the surf. Urbanization often leads to the siltation of sandy beaches, decreasing their viability. Construction of docks and marinas can destroy near-shore habitats. Boat traffic and dredging degrades <b>habitat</b> <b>and</b> can also injure or kill turtles when boats collide with turtles {{at or near the}} surface.|$|E
