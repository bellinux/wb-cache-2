5000|$|Dry-aged beef is beef {{that has}} been hung or placed on a rack to dry for several weeks. After the animal is {{slaughtered}} and cleaned, it is hung as a full or <b>half</b> <b>carcass.</b> Primal (large distinct sections) or sub primal cuts, such as strip loins, rib eyes, and sirloin, are placed in a refrigerator unit, {{also known as a}} [...] "hot box". This process involves considerable expense, as the beef must be stored near freezing temperatures. Subprimal cuts can be dry aged on racks either in specially climate-controlled coolers or within a moisture-permeable drybag. Moreover, only the higher grades of meat can be dry aged, as the process requires meat with a large, evenly distributed fat content. Because of this, dry-aged beef is seldom available outside of steak restaurants and upscale butcher shops or groceries. The key effect of dry aging is the concentration and saturation of the natural flavour, as well as the tenderization of the meat texture.|$|E

40|$|Leptin and leptin {{receptor}} genetic variants {{are associated}} with obese phenotypes in humans and mice {{and are expected to}} influence fat deposition in pigs. This study aimed to investigate the associations of LEPR polymorphism with carcass traits (<b>half</b> <b>carcass</b> weight, lean meat percentage, back-fat thickness, MLT area - musculus longisimus thoracis) and evaluation of genotypic values, additive values and dominance deviations. To identify the genotypes of LEPR candidate genes, we used biological material obtained from sows (55) and boars (51) of hybrid combination Large White x Landrace after reaching the slaughter weight. We identified three genotypes using restriction endonuclease HpaII in a group of 106 pigs. The AA genotype was the dominant one (42. 45 %), AB heterozygotes constituted 39. 62 %, while the BB genotype was the lowest (17. 93 %).

Three slaughterhouses were selected for temperature and pH measurements during the chilling process at 6 different days on 4 <b>half</b> <b>carcasses</b> in order to obtain representative data from heavy carcasses with high muscular development. Predictive microbiology was used to evaluate the potential growth of Listeria monocytogenes and Clostridium perfringens on the surface and in the depth of the carcasses. The gamma concept was chosen as secondary model taking into account the effect of temperature, pH and water activity on the selected bacteria during the chilling process. The predicted growth potential of Listeria monocytogenes is influenced by the different environmental conditions of the selected slaughterhouses and could reach 1. 4 log CFU/cm² after the chilling process. The potential growth of Clostridium perfringens is limited due to unfavourable conditions during the first hours and to low temperature later.

40|$|The aim was {{to verify}} organic system effect on carcass and meat quality of beefs. Twelve {{carcasses}} derived from Limousine x Red Pied beef, reared in the San Rossore Park (Tuscany) and slaughtered at 24 months of age, were used. After 24 h post-mortem, carcasses were evaluated according to UE classification grid: on right <b>half</b> <b>carcasses</b> several measurements were taken and carcass compacteness was calculated. After 7 days of ageing longissimus thoracis, semitendinosus and triceps brachii muscles were analysed for pH, meat colour, water holding capacity, tenderness, chemical composition, fatty acid and cholesterol content. Results underlined the good quality of meat obtained from organic system in terms of colour, tenderness, water holding capacity and suitability for domestic storage. The meat had a low content of intramuscular fat; atherogenic and thrombogenic indices were rather high, testifying the high saturated fatty-acids content, probably due both to the inadequate finishing period, both to the high slaughtering age. An appropriate finishing period, in respect of the organic guidelines, should anticipate slaughtering age and improve carcass performance, obtaining higher intramuscular fat, and perhaps lower atherogenic and thrombogenic indices. Semitendinosus appeared agreeable due to its paler and lighter meat, but was less tender and had worst water holding capacity; instead longissimus thoracis and triceps brachii, although slightly darker, gave meat more tender and with better water holding capacity...|$|R
40|$|Aiming to {{evaluate}} the mineral composition (iron, calcium and sodium) of the carcass and carcass cuts of meat from different ovine categories, 18 1 / 2 Ile de France 1 / 2 Polwarth sheeps (6 uncastrated lambs, 6 discarded ewes and 6 discarded wethers) were used. Animals were in grazing system based on Tifton - 85 pastures and were supplemented with concentrate. Lambs were slaughtered at 32 kg of live weight, at around 5 months of age. Ewes and wethers were slaughtered with 55 kg and 60 months of age. The iron values were differents between categories for those valued cuts muscles, with higher average to legs muscles from adults ovine of 3. 86 mg/ 100 g with regard to lambs of 1. 91 mg/ 100 g, respectively. The iron values of the muscles from <b>half</b> <b>carcass</b> didn't differ for that animal category, with 3. 38 mg/ 100 g average. The calcium values in muscles from <b>half</b> <b>carcass</b> and leg cut were higher to wethers (9. 84 e 7. 35 mg/ 100 g), intermediaries to ewes (6. 28 e 6. 54 mg/ 100 g) and smallers values to lambs (5. 30 e 4. 22 mg/ 100 g). There wasn't differences for sodium values to valued categories and muscles, with values around 56. 75 mg/ 100 g. In conclusion, the sodium values are similar between animals categories and from differents carcass muscles and that the iron and calcium values present differences...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the effect of fattening diets supplemented with betaine on growth performances and carcass characteristics of Alentejano pigs. Sixteen Alentejano pigs sexually neutralized, with a initial body weight (BW) of 36. 3 kg, allocated to open-air individual pens (3 m 2), {{were divided into two}} experimental groups: Group C (n= 8) consuming a commercial diet with 150 g/kg crude protein and 13. 0 MJ digestible energy; and group CB (n= 8) consuming the same diet supplemented with betaine (1 g/kg). The diets were restrictively offered at 85 % estimated ad libitum consumption. All pigs had free access to fresh water. Diet refusals were measured daily and pigs were weighed weekly. At 100 kg BW, pigs were submitted to a 24 h fasting period and killed. Carcass weight, backfat thickness and Longissimus muscle area were determined. The left side <b>half</b> <b>carcass</b> was submitted to commercial cuts according to the Portuguese norm and their weights recorded. No significant differences between treatments were detected in feed intake (297. 3 vs. 286. 5 kg), average daily gain (472 vs. 480 g) and feed:gain (4. 66 vs. 4. 51). Hot carcass weight (82. 2 vs. 83. 6 kg), backfat thickness (5. 0 vs. 5. 3 cm), Longissimus muscle area (21. 9 vs. 21. 2 cm 2) and weights of commercial cuts of the <b>half</b> <b>carcass</b> were also not significantly affected by betaine supplementation...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this experiment was to evaluate the percentage of some selected muscles of antelope relative to its <b>half</b> <b>carcass</b> weight, proximate composition of raw and cooked antelope meat as well as sensory attributes of the meat. Four antelopes of mixed sex and of 2 - 2. 5 years were used for this study. They were purchased live from Ago-Iwoye market in Ogun State, Nigeria and were transported to Meat Science Laboratory of the Department of Animal Production, Olabisi Onabanjo University, Yewa Campus, Ayetoro for processing. They were weighed, bled, eviscerated, washed and chilled at 4 oC for 24 hours. The carcasses were sawed into two halves and one half was weighed and fabricated into primal cuts. Selected muscles were excised from the cuts weighed and their percentages relative to chilled <b>half</b> <b>carcass</b> weight were determined. Proximate composition of raw and cooked semimembranosus and longissimus dorsi muscles {{as well as the}} taste panel evaluation of the two muscles was conducted on a 9 -point hedonic scale I correspond to dislike very much and 9 like very much after broiling the meat at 160 oC for 25 min. The results showed that longissimus dorsi muscle was biggest followed by biceps femoris, quadriceps femoris and semimembranosus muscles, while vectus abdomimis, bradclialis and biceps brachii muscles were smallest. Crude protein, ash, nitrogen free extract and tenderness were higher in cooked meat, while fat was lower. In conclusion, antelope (Antilope cervicapra) should be domesticated to complement the conventional livestocks so that adequate meat supply to growing human population can be achieved...|$|E

40|$|Sheep {{production}} in Botswana {{is not a}} very popular enterprise compared to cattle and goats production while dairy production is an emerging animal agriculture. This paper discusses constraints to mutton and dairy production and reviews the importation of mutton, milk and milk products over twelve years (1990 - 2001) into Botswana to meet the huge deficit in supply. Detailed mutton, milk and milk products import data were obtained from Trade Statistics Unit in Gaborone Botswana. Mutton import are from the Republic of South Africa (RSA), Lesotho, Zimbabwe and Namibia while milk and milk products are mainly from the Republic of South Africa. The bulk of mutton import was from RSA in the form of fresh or chilled <b>carcasses</b> and <b>half</b> <b>carcasses.</b> Botswana imported 27732 Kg of mutton in 1990 worth 209, 050 South African Rands (6. 0 R= 1 US$). The mutton importation increased drastically to 777, 164 Kg (2802. 41 %) in 2001 worth 4, 896, 273 Rands (2342. 15 %). Total import of fresh milk was 7. 2 million litres in 2003. This paper suggests possible methods to enhance mutton and milk production locally and reduce the net import of mutton and milk products. The increase in mutton import is a clear indication for the need to increase sheep {{production in}} Botswana and the need for livestock farmers to diversify the beef industry and include other ruminants for commercial production...|$|R
