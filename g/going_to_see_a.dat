25|$|The play {{opens with}} Wong, a water seller, {{explaining}} {{to the audience}} that {{he is on the}} city outskirts awaiting the foretold appearance of several important gods. Soon the gods arrive and ask Wong to find them shelter for the night. They are tired, having travelled far and wide in search of good people who still live according to the principles that they, the gods, have handed down. Instead they have found only greed, evil, dishonesty, and selfishness. The same turns out to be true in Szechwan: no one will take them in, no one has the time or means to care for others – no one except the poor young prostitute Shen Teh, whose pure inherent charity cannot allow her to turn away anyone in need. Shen Teh was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> customer, but decides to help out instead; however confusion follows leaving Wang fleeing from the illustrious Ones, leaving his water carrying pole behind.|$|E

500|$|Zimmerman and {{his team}} took {{feedback}} from the directors of previous Star Trek series to make the new space easier in which to film. Whereas in other series there has been purpose built sets for briefing rooms, following the feedback this area was built into the bridge itself as the directors had stated that it proved difficult to make several people sit around a table seem interesting. The transporter design {{was intended as a}} reference to the original series design that was created by Matt Jefferies, with Zimmerman including certain design elements such as the wall patterns around the transporter itself. The design of the engineering deck was overhauled from previous series with the intention for it to look like the engine room of a nuclear submarine. Zimmerman described it saying, [...] "You're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> very powerful engine that looks like a very powerful engine." ...|$|E

[...] Rick Hendrick, the owner of Hendrick Motorsports, expressed his enjoyment of winning the race, stating, [...] "When you're a champion like Jeff Gordon, you know you can still do it, (even) when people overlook you.

Small Alison has a homework assignment to draw a map of places her family has lived, but Bruce aggressively takes over, drawing it the way he thinks it should look. Alison realizes that despite having traveled and lived in Europe, her father's place of birth, life, work and death can all {{be placed in a}} small circle in Beech Creek, Pennsylvania ("Maps"). Bruce offers a ride and a beer to an underage boy, and it is later implied that they had a sexual encounter. Medium Alison writes to her parents, asking for a response to her coming-out letter. Small Alison watches The Partridge Family, but Bruce switches it off. Small Alison talks to him, and finds out that he is <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> psychiatrist because he is [...] "bad" [...] and not good like her. Alison expresses annoyance that he lied to her; the actual reason he was going was because he was arrested for what he did to the underage boy. Helen tells Small Alison that the psychiatrist will help her father, and attempts to reassure her. Bruce starts a vicious argument with Helen and breaks several of her possessions along with some library books. Small Alison fantasizes about her family as the happy family singing together on television ("Raincoat of Love").|$|E
500|$|... "Irresistible" [...] is a groove-laden song, {{following}} a musical setting that is beat-oriented. In {{an interview with}} Associated Press, Simpson said that [...] "Irresistible" [...] is [...] "very sexy, more grown-up. I think you're <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> new side of Jessica Simpson." [...] Lyrically, according to Birgisson, the song carries some feminine viewpoints that Sheyne had managed to incorporate through her contribution. Ben Graham, the author of Maximum Jessica Simpson, noted that the lyrics suggest that Simpson {{finds it hard to}} keep her famous virginity image intact. This can be inferred from the lines [...] "I know that I'm supposed to make him wait / Let him think I like the chase / But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I meant to say no." [...] Bob Waliszewski of Plugged In pointed out that the verses [...] "I can't stop fanning the fire [...] Now inescapable" [...] refer to an [...] "imminent sexual compromise". [...] "She knows she shouldn't give in, but seems past the point of no return," [...] he explained. However, Taylor stated that lyrically, the song demands for [...] "total fulfillment". The version featured on Lizzie McGuire soundtrack replaces the lyric [...] "When he makes me weak with desire" [...] with [...] "When he makes me want to move closer" [...] and [...] "But I can't stop fanning the fire / I know I meant to say no" [...] with [...] "But it's time to stop this emotion / Right now I'm gonna say no." ...|$|E

500|$|Vedder called [...] "Gonna See My Friend" [...] a [...] "drug song," [...] but {{elaborated}} {{that the}} song is about <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> <b>a</b> friend to stay off drugs, and he stated that [...] "Got Some" [...] is about a [...] "drug dealer," [...] but added what the drug the dealer is selling is actually a great rock song. [...] "Johnny Guitar", described by Vedder as [...] "almost an Elvis Costello homage", had its lyrics inspired by a collage of album covers that is pasted on the bathroom wall of the band's rehearsal space. Vedder noticed the album cover for Johnny [...] "Guitar" [...] Watson's 1979 album, What the Hell Is This?, and imagined a man who becomes attracted {{to one of the}} various women on the cover and then wonders why this woman would rather be one of Watson's many girlfriends instead of his only one. Vedder described [...] "Just Breathe" [...] as [...] "as close to a love song as we've ever gotten," [...] and said that the subject of {{the song is}} the happiest times of people's lives when they should just take in the moment and [...] "breathe for a minute." [...] He also said that [...] "Unthought Known" [...] concerns the human psyche, and [...] "Supersonic" [...] is about the love for music. According to Vedder, [...] "Speed of Sound" [...] is a song taken {{from the perspective of a}} man who is still sitting in a bar after everyone else has left, but he added that even though the song is sad it became more [...] "confident" [...] when played with the whole band. He said [...] "Force of Nature" [...] is [...] "about the strength of one person in the relationship, when they can withstand some of the faults in another." [...] "The End" [...] has been described as an [...] "aching love song." ...|$|E

I did <b>see</b> <b>an</b> interesting experiment, but not in representative government. Every one who is interested in Bolshevism knows the series of elections, from the village meeting to the All-Russian Soviet, by which the people's commissaries are supposed to derive their power. We were told that, by the recall, the occupational constituencies, and so on, a new and far more perfect machinery had been devised for ascertaining and registering the popular will. One of the things we hoped to study was the question whether the Soviet system is really superior to Parliamentarism in this respect.|$|R

2500|$|The show's creators {{claim that}} they weren't {{engaging}} in a product placement strategy for commercial gain.
