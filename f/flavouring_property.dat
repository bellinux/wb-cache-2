High resolution gas chromatography-mass spectrometry analysis of neutral volatile compounds produced in whey showed that, considering both neo-formation compounds and substances quantified in the whey cultures at different concentrations {{in comparison to the}} extract from sterile whey, the groups of lactococci, enterococci, thermophilic streptococci and mesophilic lactobacilli produced a higher number of volatiles than thermophilic lactobacilli and leuconostocs. Applying principal component analysis (PCA) to the results, enterococci, mesophilic lactobacilli and thermophilic streptococci showed a broad diversity, while lactococci included rather similar strains as well as strains with special <b>flavouring</b> <b>properties.</b> Applying PCA to thermophilic streptococci and enterococci, to lactococci and enterococci, to lactococci and thermophilic streptococci, or to mesophilic and thermophilic lactobacilli, the strains gathered consistently with their systematic position.

40|$|Coumarin is a {{naturally}} occurring flavouring substance which {{is contained in}} many plants (for example woodruff, sweet clover, tonka beans). Higher concentrations {{are to be found}} particularly in some types of cinnamon. Coumarin is used as a fragrance substance in cosmetics and is an active substance in medicinal products. For a few years cinnamon-containing food supplements have also been on sale which are said to reduce the blood sugar level and the blood lipid concentrations of diabetics. Because of the harmful effect of larger amounts – coumarin can cause hepatic damage – coumarin may only be used as an ingredient of flavourings and other food additives with <b>flavouring</b> <b>properties</b> in the food sector. What's more, it has long been known that in animal experiments coumarin can trigger the formation of tumours. More recent scientific findings indicate that there is no genotoxic mechanism of action, something which had been suspected for a long time. The European Commission thereupon submitted a draft amendment to the Flavourings Directive which envisages removing the existing constraints on coumarin. The Federal Institute for Risk Assessment (BfR) took another look at coumarin from the angle of consumer health protection. BfR is of the opinion that dietary coumarin intake should continue to be restricted. In order to avoid high coumarin exposure from direct consumption (e. g. rice pudding with cinnamon and sugar) statutory measures are also desirable...|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} {{known that the}} chemical analysis of the volatile compounds of foods is not adequate to describe the complexity of flavours; as a consequence, sensory analysis is the fundamental methodology to determine quality and acceptability of food products. Nonetheless, instrumental estimations of human reactions to food are still highly demanded. To this regard the synthetic and qualitative representation of data originated by multivariate instruments has gained importance in the last years. In particular, fingerprints from chemical sensor arrays have been a subject of investigation aimed at developing instrumental measurements of human olfactory perceptions. In this paper, a study case on {{the application of a}} sensor array aimed at appraising the <b>flavour</b> <b>properties</b> of custard desserts seasoned with strawberry aroma is presented. These studies were intended {{to determine the effects of}} some key ingredients (milk fat content and sugar type) to the aroma and to the aroma temporal decay under controlled storage. Sensor data have been compared and complemented with those provided by gas-chromatography and sensory analysis. The results indicate that custard headspace fingerprinting can obviously recognize the addition of artificial flavours, and, more noteworthy, discriminate among fat milk content and sugar types used to prepare the samples. Furthermore, composition was also found to affect the temporal evolution of aroma evidencing distinct paths in a principal component analysis (PCA) score plot for samples prepared with different ingredients...|$|R
40|$|The present paper {{describes}} the {{modification of the}} lipid fraction of dry-cured fermented sausage through fat reduction (35 %) and fat replacement of animal fat with olive oil (up to 10 %). High pressure processing (HPP) treated meat was employed as a novel fat replacer to reduce the fat content and as a new strategy to enable a stable incorporation of olive oil in dry-cured fermented sausages. Chemical (proximate composition and fatty acid profile), physical (water retention, structure formation and colour) and sensorial (appearance, texture and <b>flavour)</b> <b>properties</b> were evaluated. It is concluded that 35 % of fat reduction is possible without reduction of consumer acceptability. Moreover, the addition of HPP-treated meat as a fat replacer resulted in good mimic of the fat particles together with good physical and sensory properties. Therefore, it resulted in an effective and clean alternative (no added-additives) for fat reduction. However, the incorporation of olive oil either by direct addition (4. 3 % oil) or within a HPP-created protein network (10 % oil) resulted in unacceptable products since the oil was not properly retained inside the sausage matrix. Further {{studies are needed to}} find processing strategies that permit a stable incorporation of liquid plant oils to dry-cured fermented sausage for the development of healthier and more sustainable dry-cured fermented meat products...|$|R

This research investigated the sensory properties of vegetables vis-a-vis other core foods that comprise children's diets, to determine {{to what degree}} low acceptance of vegetables {{can be attributed to}} sensory properties. Vegetables (n = 34) were compared to fruit (n = 26), dairy (n = 28), meat/fish (n = 28) and grains (n = 38); these foods were representative of the diet of Australian children and profiled by a trained sensory panel on 10 key taste and texture attributes {{as part of a larger}} study (Lease, Hendrie, Poelman, Delahunty, & Cox, 2016). Mean intensities were analysed using ANOVA. Vegetables were more bitter in taste than the other food categories and amongst the hardest. They were the lowest, or amongst the lowest, in all other <b>flavour</b> <b>properties.</b> Other core food categories had sensory properties known to be drivers of food liking: sweet and sour for fruit, sour, salty and fatty for dairy, salty, umami and fatty for meat/fish, and salty for grains. No food category other than vegetables had a bitter taste, a known driver of dislike. This research shows that vegetables, relative to other food groups, have sensory properties that are known to predispose to low acceptance based on innate likes and dislikes or preferences acquired within the first few months of life. High hardness of vegetables implicates a slow eating rate, which is generally beneficial from a public health perspective, but may make it difficult to meet recommended vegetable intake. To increase children's acceptance and intake for vegetables, either vegetable sensory properties can be modified, or children's acceptance for vegetables can be modified through sensory learning strategies. </p...|$|R

40|$|Hop {{market and}} beer {{industry}} {{have always been}} of secondary relevance in Italy as compared to grape and wine sector. Hence, hop cultivars and the information for growing hops have been generated almost entirely from the major hop production countries. Identifying cultivars that perform well in Mediterranean environments is therefore essential to successfully start hop cultivation and breeding activity in this new growing region. To evaluate the intraspecific diversity of hop in Central Italy, 20 female hop genotypes with different origin were screened during three growing seasons (2013 - 2015) in an experimental hop yard. Cones yield, plant height and crop phenology were evaluated to determine which cultivars were best suited to the Mediterranean climate. Moreover, given the rising interest {{for the development of}} local beers with distinguishing aroma, a sensory analysis was performed and beers flavoured with locally produced and imported cones were compared. A significant diversity among cultivars was found for all parameters investigated. The results indicated that weather condition during flowering and development of cones markedly affected yield and plant height. Cones yield was negatively correlated with thermal time (r=– 0. 5, P< 0. 05) to harvest and positively with plant height (r= 0. 56, P< 0. 05). Cascade, Hallertauer Magnum, Hersbrucker Spa t and Yeoman showed the best adaptability to the Mediterranean growing conditions as they were the top-performing cultivars across the three years. Sensory analysis evidenced the importance of cultivar selection as determining factor for <b>flavouring</b> <b>properties</b> of beers.

The Panel noted that the Scientific Committee on Food (SCF) had expressed an opinion on furfural and furfural diethylacetal in December 2002 and took cognizance of the documentation used in arriving at that opinion. The Panel also considered additional data on the potential genotoxicity of furfural not {{available at the time}} of the SCF opinion. The new toxicological data on the genotoxic potential of furfural addressed the reservation of the SCF concerning the mechanism by which furfural induced tumours (hepatocellular adenomas and carcinomas) and whether this was a thresholded process. The Panel concluded that, the new study in a transgenic mouse strain demonstrated that furfural did not induce gene mutations in vivo. Based on this, together with earlier studies reviewed by the SCF, the Panel concluded that the tumour induction was secondary to chronic toxic liver injury and was probably thresholded. Since furfural diethylacetal is rapidly converted to furfural at physiological pH, the Panel established an Acceptable Daily Intake (ADI) for furfural and the furfural component of furfural diethylacetal of 0. 5 mg/kg bw based on a NOAEL (no-observed-adverse-effect level) for hepatotoxicity in a 90 -day study in rats of 54 mg/kg bw/day to which a safety factor of 100 was applied.

40|$|In recent years, the Danish {{milk market}} has shown an {{increase}} in the consumption of organic milk as well as a growing variety of milk with specific features including farm milk. The production of milk from a single farm and pasture-based (PB) feeding regimes is of special interest as it implies a “sense of place” or terroir. The PB feeding regimes vary with season and might also vary on a day-to-day basis. It is therefore important to understand the impact of the feed on the sensory properties of the milk [1]. This study aims at demonstrating how analytical sensory analysis can provide important information about the influence of breed, season and variation in farm management from PB feeding regimes on the sensory properties of organic farm milk. The study was performed in 2007 and 2008 during two seasons (spring/autumn) representing 28 milk samples from 7 organic farms with either Holstein or Jersey cows. PB feeding regimes were based on pastures with varying amounts of white clover together with perennial ryegrass and supplement feeding with silage and concentrates. Significant results were found for season and breed with a larger variation in sensory <b>flavour</b> <b>properties</b> of spring milk and milk from Holstein cows. In general, there was a tendency of the milk being characterized as having a ‘greener’ odour, ‘sweet’ and ‘maize-like’ flavour in spring and a more ‘bitter’ taste in the autumn. The results show a distinct relation between sensory milk properties and the amount of pasture in the ration and white clover in the pasture. Relations to other production conditions such as composition of the supplement feed also tended {{to have an impact on}} the sensory characteristics of the milk. It is thus concluded, that a sensory analytical tool can provide important information about the sensory properties of organic farm milk, reflecting time and place. Seasonal variations appear to be an important factor in the terroir dimension of milk and may be more actively used in relation to communication of the sensory properties to the consumer. ...|$|R

Ascorbic acid degradation and HMF formation were observed to follow a first-order reaction model while browning and furfural formation followed a zero-order model. Temperature dependence of the different reactions could be described by the linear and Arrhenius expressions over the temperature range of 10 to 36 °C. The initial dissolved oxygen content (0. 41, 1. 44 and 3. 74 mg/L) did not significantly affect the rate of ascorbic acid degradation and furfural formation in single-strength lemon juice stored at 36 °C. However, browning and HMF formation were significantly higher in the juice with 3. 74 mg/L dissolved oxygen content than in the samples {{with the other two}} oxygen contents. The total soluble solids concentration affected the rates of the different reactions but not to such a significant extent as the temperature effect. Ascorbic acid retention was observed to increase with an increase in soluble solids content. The rate of the browning reaction generally increased with increases in soluble solids content for the 20 to 50 °Brix juice samples. The rate of furfural formation consistently increased with increases in soluble solids level at 36 °C, but was not as consistent at 10 and 20 °C. The rate constants and activation energy values of the different reactions for the 9 °Brix juice were considerably higher than those for the 20 °Brix concentrate. These observations and the poor correlation obtained between ascorbic acid retention and browning, and between ascorbic acid retention and furfural formation for the higher Brix concentrates, suggested that different reactions or reaction mechanisms predominated in single-strength juice compared with concentrates. Furfural could serve as an index of quality deterioration in single-strength lemon juice but not in concentrates (20 - 50 °Brix) due to its simultaneous formation and decomposition at these high soluble solids levels. The sensory panel perceived significant changes in colour in the juices prior to changes in flavour. The browning reaction should thus be the main criterion in the determination of storage life. Low temperature storage is essential for optimum storage stability. Over a 16 -week storage period at 10 °C, it is suggested that lemon juice be stored as a 50 °Brix concentrate. Some advantages of storing lemon juice at such high soluble solids levels are high retention of ascorbic acid and <b>flavour</b> <b>properties,</b> and reduction in storage and distribution costs. To extend the storage life of lemon juice concentrates beyond four months, storage temperatures lower than 10 °C would be necessary so that the extent of browning would not reach unacceptable levels...|$|R

40|$|Because of coeliac disease, some {{individuals}} cannot tolerate the protein gliadin {{present in the}} gluten fraction of wheat flour. From a commercial perspective, {{there is a need}} for the development of gluten-free bread with texture and <b>flavour</b> <b>properties</b> similar to the conventional wheat flour loaf. In the context of bread, the gluten component of wheat has a crucial role in stabilising the gas-cell structure and maintaining the rheological properties of the bread. The absence of gluten results in liquid batter rather than pre-baking dough, yielding baked bread with a crumbling texture, poor colour and other post-baking quality defects. The liquid batter cannot be processed on the existing production line of baking industry. The aim is to develop a gluten-free white loaf with similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread on the existing processing lines at Quality Bakers New Zealand. Within this constraint, dough has to be produced with handling and moulding properties similar to those of conventional wheat flour loaves. This research focused on finding and implementing the gluten substitutes for the development of gluten-free high quality commercial bread. In this research, the independent variables were conventional wheat flour (the most basic control), other gluten-free flours from a variety of sources, starches, supplementary proteins, hydrocolloids such as hydroxypropylmethylcellulose (HPMC), hydrophilic psyllium husk, and enzymes such as microbial transglutaminase, glucose oxidase, lipase and fungal α-amylase. These ingredients were trialled in different combination and composition to produce a dough having ability to trap the carbon dioxide gas during proofing and baking to get high specific volume bread suitable for the Quality Bakers’ product range. After an essentially ‘shotgun’ approach to formulations, the research narrowed to a systematic and progressive variation of ingredients and their composition to develop workable commercial models. Ingredients and their compositions were manipulated according to the outcomes of the trials and their contribution in the formulations. The dependent variables included standard bakery rheological properties based on dough stickiness, dough extensibility, oven spring, bread specific volume, bread slice ability, and bread staling. A gelation system of the lower-temperature-stable hydrocolloid psyllium husk, the heat-stable hydrocolloid hydroxypropylmethylcellulose, maize starch, and potato starch was created to form industrial process able dough having ability to entrap carbon dioxide gas produced during proofing and initial phase of baking. Microbial transglutaminase was used to increase the cross linking of protein present in flours and supplemented for enhancing the dough-like structure and its gas entrapping abilities. A formulation has been discovered by this research for the development of high quality gluten-free commercial bread. The formulated bread has similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread and can be produced on existing processing lines at Quality Bakers. Industrial process able gluten-free bread with similar quality characteristics to that of standard white bread can be formulated by using a specific combination of soy flour, maize starch, potato starch, yoghurt powder, milk protein, HPMC (K 4 M), psyllium husk, microbial transglutaminase, lipase, and fungal α-amylase. The significance of this research is mainly commercial and the insights gained may extend to other bakery items that could be used by coeliacs...|$|R
40|$|Overconsumption {{of foods}} {{is thought to}} be one of the main causes of the rising number of global obesity. This thesis aims to {{investigate}} the role of food flavour in human appetite and eating behaviour through three studies. The first study investigated whether the sweetness intensity of a milkshake affected ad libitum intake of the milkshake and sensory-specific satiety (SSS). In a crossover single-blinded design, 24 participants consumed ad libitum high, ideal and low sweetness (HS, IS or LS) milkshakes over three visits. After milkshake intake, participants consumed ad libitum one, or both of a sweet and a savoury snack. All milkshake consumption was similar, suggesting that the sweetness intensity did not affect the ad libitum intake of the milkshake. After intake of all sweet milkshakes, ratings of desire for something sweet decreased, and subsequent savoury snacks were consumed more than subsequent sweet snacks. The sweetness intensity of milkshakes did not affect the change in the desire for something sweet or the subsequent snack intake. Ratings of desire for something savoury increased after the intake of HS milkshake and were higher than the ratings collected following the intake of IS milkshake. Therefore, this study suggested that a sweeter milkshake did not affect the magnitude of SSS for sweet foods, but increased a stronger sensory-specific appetite (SSA) for savoury foods. The second study examined the effects of aroma, taste and their interaction on subjective appetite sensation and subsequent lunch intake. In a crossover design, 26 females consumed 1 of the 4 test drinks as a preload: 1) water; 2) strawberry aroma in water; 3) sucrose and citric acid in water; 4) strawberry aroma, sucrose and citric acid in water. The subsequent lunch intake did not differ after all drink preloads. The drink with only aroma or only taste were not different from water in affecting appetite sensation. A drink with both aroma and taste reduced hunger ratings greater than water or a drink with only taste or aroma, during 15 min drinking and up to 30 min post drinking. Meanwhile, the drink with both taste and aroma was the highest in perceived flavour intensity. This suggests enhancing flavour perception of a drink through aroma-taste cross-modal interaction can increase the satiating effect of a drink. The third study investigated effects of sweetness, thickness and caramel flavour perception of custards on expected satiation and expected satiety of the custards. 90 participants (65 females, 25 males) tasted 18 custard samples over two sessions. Ingredients of custards were different only in the concentrations of caramel aroma, Truvia sweetener and carboxymethyl cellulose (CMC), based on an experimental design. Thickness enhanced both expected satiation and expected satiety. Sweetness enhanced expected satiation but not expected satiety. Caramel flavour did not affect expected satiation or expected satiety. The cognitive expectation on satiation and satiety has previously been shown to determine self-selected portion size. Therefore, the current study suggests that manipulating sweetness and thickness perception of a food without changing its energy content might help portion size control, via manipulating consumers’ cognitive expectation of the food. In conclusion, manipulating food flavour is a promising area to explore with the respect to hunger suppression and fullness enhancing, limiting the intake of eaten foods while promoting intake of other foods via SSS or SSA, and contributing to the cognitive control of portion size. Therefore, manipulation food flavour might be helpful for appetite control and supporting an energy-restrict diet; however, it seems challenging to reduce actual food energy intake through manipulating only the <b>flavour</b> <b>properties</b> of foods...|$|R
40|$|This work {{deals with}} the {{development}} of a process for the production of commercial stock from beef bones using a formal food process engineering analysis instead of random experimental trials of potential processes. The major difference between a food and a traditional chemical process engineering analysis is the inclusion of the food functional, textural and/or sensory properties besides the yield and efficiency in the optimal design. These properties often interact with the process and equipment design. The bones were extracted with hot water and the kinetics of extraction determined by following the changes in soluble solids over time. Extraction curves measured at several temperatures between 80 and 120 °C could be modelled using first order rise to an equilibrium concentration and the effect of extraction temperature could be measured using the Arrhenius law. Despite the presence of gelatine in the aqueous stock extracts, which is known to produce strongly time-dependent non-Newtonian solutions, they were found to be Newtonian for temperatures above 20 °C. Thus the Newtonian viscosity of the aqueous extracts was measured as an indicator of stock texture. Textural changes due to exposure to high temperatures over time were determined for temperatures between 60 and 120 °C and found to follow first order kinetics. The effect of temperature followed the Arrhenius law. An equilibrium curve for bone extraction in hot water at 120 °C and a maximum yield of extractable solids non-fat were also determined. A mathematical model was constructed on an Excel platform using the kinetics of extraction and textural changes as well as the equilibrium data. It is based on a novel method of analysis of multi-stage solid-liquid extraction called “stage wise iterative analysis” and gave a profile of soluble solids concentration and viscosity during the extraction and concentration phases of the manufacturing process that fell within less than 10 % of experimental measurements. Simulations showed that soluble solids concentration, viscosity, yield and processing time all impacted on the optimum design. These analyses highlighted the significant importance of reducing the run time from the current 6 days to 5 hours as {{it has the potential to}} increase the production rate and therefore revenue ten-fold with a minimum change in equipment. The higher extraction rate can be achieved by increasing the extraction temperature from the current 92 °C to 120 °C. While the rate of losses of viscosity and therefore texture is increased with the higher processtemperature, the model showed that the great reduction in processing time more than compensates for the temperature effect and the viscosity of the final stock extract is greater than that found in the current industrial operation. It was also found that the yield of extracts from the bones could be improved significantly by conducting a multi-stage semi-counter current extraction instead of a single stage extraction for the same overall extraction time. Preliminary considerations were given to the use of secondary product streams, high quality tallow and calcium phosphate to improve further the financial returns of the process. Finally a process modification was considered to improve the consistency of the <b>flavour</b> <b>properties</b> of the stock. It was proposed that separating the meat from the bones and roasting it in a smaller oven to allow quick and separate extraction of the flavour components found in the commercial stock. These can be added back to the bone extracts in standardised quantities to produce a product of consistent flavour...|$|R
