25|$|In 1948, Niven met Hjördis Paulina Tersmeden (née Genberg, 1919–1997), a {{divorced}} Swedish fashion model. He recounted their meeting:I {{had never seen}} anything so beautiful in my life—tall, slim, auburn hair, up-tilted nose, lovely mouth and the most enormous grey eyes <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> It really happened the way it does when written by the worst lady novelists... I goggled. I had difficulty swallowing and had champagne in my knees.|$|E
25|$|The villa {{was sold}} in 1960 to the Vuilleumier family, who used it first as a private family home, {{and for the past}} few years as a hotel. In 1976 the American writer Gore Vidal (who lived in La Rondinaia, a nearby house built by Lucy Beckett, from 1972 to 2004) wrote of Villa Cimbrone: Twenty five years ago I was asked by an American {{magazine}} what was the most beautiful place that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in all my travels and I said the view from the belvedere of the Villa Cimbrone on a bright winter's day when the sky and the sea were each so vividly blue that it was not possible to tell one from the other.|$|E
25|$|Polanski later stated that, in {{the months}} {{following}} the murders, he suspected various friends and associates, and his paranoia subsided only when the killers were arrested. Newspapers claimed that many Hollywood stars were moving out of the city, while others were reported to have installed security systems in their homes. Writer Dominick Dunne later recalled the tension:The shock waves that went through the town were beyond anything <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> before. People were convinced that the rich and famous of the community were in peril. Children were sent out of town. Guards were hired. Steve McQueen packed a gun when he went to Jay Sebring's funeral. In 1994, the Tate/Polanski house was demolished and a new house was constructed on the site with the street address changed to 10066 Cielo Drive.|$|E

Congratulations on just a masterful work tonight. It was an honor calling this fight. Thank you very much, brother.|$|R
500|$|When Little was in prison, he met fellow convict John Bembry, a self-educated man {{he would}} later {{describe}} as [...] "the first man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> command total respect … with words". Under Bembry's influence, Little developed a voracious appetite for reading.|$|E
500|$|University of Missouri Tigers coach Tim Jamieson {{spotted him}} in a summer league, and {{convinced}} him to head east for his junior year. Jamieson said, [...] "I saw him take ground balls and thought, defensively, he was as good a middle infielder as <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> As for his bat, I didn't really care." [...] While there, Kinsler had a [...]335 batting average, [...]416 on-base percentage, and [...]536 slugging percentage, with 16 steals in 17 attempts. He {{was named to the}} All-Big 12 Conference second team. Jamieson noted, [...] "From the day Ian stepped through the doors here, you could see it on his face: He was on a mission." ...|$|E
500|$|Frederick Treves {{first met}} Merrick that November {{at a private}} viewing, before Norman opened the shop for the day. Treves later {{recalled}} in his 1923 Reminiscences that Merrick was [...] "the most disgusting specimen of humanity that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> ... at no time had I met with such a degraded or perverted version {{of a human being}} as this lone figure displayed." [...] The viewing lasted no more than 15 minutes after which Treves returned to work. Later that day, he sent Tuckett back to the shop to ask if Merrick might be willing to come to the hospital for an examination. Norman and Merrick agreed. To enable him to travel the short distance without drawing undue attention, Merrick wore a costume consisting of an oversized black cloak and a brown cap with a burlap sack that covered his face, and rode in a cab hired by Treves.|$|E
5000|$|This [...] "torpedo-shaped" [...] beam {{of light}} was quite unlike any other {{celestial}} object that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> The quality of its light, and its occurrence while a great magnetic storm and a bright aurora were in progress, seem to establish its auroral origin. But it differed very widely in appearance from any other aurora that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b>|$|R
60|$|But {{the room}} was not quite dark. There was a ghastly light {{trembling}} over it; like nothing that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> by day; like nothing that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> by night. <b>I</b> dimly discerned Selina's bed, and {{the frame of the}} window, and the curtains on either side of it--but not the starlight, and not the shadowy tops of the trees in the garden.|$|R
2500|$|Six-time All-Ireland dual medallist and All-Ireland-winning manager Jimmy Barry-Murphy wrote: [...] "He is most {{certainly}} the greatest hurler that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> and <b>I</b> even saw Christy Ring {{towards the end}} of his days. But this guy outshines everything that <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> on a hurling field. His work ethic is amazing, and one that others must aspire to if they are to reach the stars." ...|$|R
500|$|Milk drifted from California to Texas to New York, {{without a}} steady job or plan. In New York City he became {{involved}} with O'Horgan's theater company as a [...] "general aide", signing on as associate producer for Lenny and for Eve Merriam's Inner City. The time he had spent with the cast of flower children wore away much of Milk's conservatism. A contemporary New York Times story about O'Horgan described Milk as [...] "a sad eyed man—another aging hippie with long, long hair, wearing faded jeans and pretty beads". Craig Rodwell read {{the description of the}} formerly uptight man and wondered if it could be the same person. One of Milk's Wall Street friends worried that he seemed to have no plan or future, but remembered Milk's attitude: [...] "I think he was happier than at any time <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> him in his entire life." ...|$|E
500|$|In October 1905, MacArthur {{received}} {{orders to}} proceed to Tokyo for appointment as aide-de-camp to his father. A man who knew the MacArthurs at this time wrote that: [...] "Arthur MacArthur was the most flamboyantly egotistical man <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> until I met his son." [...] They inspected Japanese military bases at Nagasaki, Kobe and Kyoto, then headed to India via Shanghai, Hong Kong, Java and Singapore, reaching Calcutta in January 1906. In India, they visited Madras, Tuticorin, Quetta, Karachi, the Northwest Frontier and the Khyber Pass. They then sailed to China via Bangkok and Saigon, and toured Canton, Tsingtao, Peking, Tientsin, Hankow and Shanghai before returning to Japan in June. The next month {{they returned to the}} United States, where Arthur MacArthur resumed his duties at Fort Mason, still with Douglas as his aide. In September, Douglas received orders to report to the 2nd Engineer Battalion at the Washington Barracks and enroll in the Engineer School. While there he also served as [...] "an aide to assist at White House functions" [...] at the request of President Theodore Roosevelt.|$|E
500|$|In 1848, Aqil {{assisted}} {{an expedition}} headed by US Navy captain William Francis Lynch to the Dead Sea, and became {{known in the}} United States and Europe through the publication of Lynch's book that year. Vivid descriptions of Aqil by Lynch are quoted at length {{in the works of}} Finn. Lynch's first encounter with Aqil was in the divan of Said Bey, the Ottoman kaimakam of Acre, and is recorded as follows:But what especially attracted my attention was a magnificent savage enveloped in a scarlet cloth pelisse richly embroidered with gold. He was the handsomest, and I soon thought also the most graceful being <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> His complexion was of a rich mellow indescribable olive tint, and his hair a glossy black; his teeth were regular and of the whitest ivory, and the glance of his eye was keen at times, but generally soft and lustrous. With the tarboosh upon his head which he seemed to wear uneasily, he reclined, rather than sat upon {{the opposite side of the}} divân, while his hand played in unconscious familiarity with the hilt of his yataghan. He looked like one who would be 'Steel amid the din of arms, and wax when with the fair.' ...|$|E

500|$|With wind gusts {{reaching}} , coach Bill Parcells {{chose to}} take the wind when his team won the opening coin toss of the Giants' NFC Championship Game against the Washington Redskins. With the wind at their backs the Giants scored 10 first quarter points while the Redskins managed only two first downs. The Redskins were forced to punt {{three times in the}} quarter, and the wind limited those punts to 23, 27, and 24 yards. The Redskins launched a drive behind Jay Schroeder's 48-yard completion to wide receiver Art Monk in the second quarter. However, after the Redskins botched the field goal snap on a 51-yard field goal attempt, the Giants drove for a touchdown with the wind in their face to make the score 17–0 at halftime. The Giants defense dominated the second half, and both teams went scoreless to make the final score 17–0. Schroeder completed only 20 of 50 passes for a meager 3.8yards per attempt. Keys to the victory were tackle Brad Benson's neutralizing of Redskins pass rusher Dexter Manley, who had 18.5 sacks on the season, and the team's defense. After the game, John Madden remarked: [...] "Last year, I thought the Bears had the best defense <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen.</b> But in the last two weeks, I feel these Giants have as good a defense as has ever played in this league." ...|$|E
500|$|Bowie met dancer Lindsay Kemp in 1967 and {{enrolled}} in his dance {{class at the}} London Dance Centre. He commented in 1972 that meeting Kemp was when his interest in image [...] "really blossomed". [...] "He lived on his emotions, {{he was a wonderful}} influence. His day-to-day life was the most theatrical thing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> ever. It was everything I thought Bohemia probably was. I joined the circus." [...] Studying the dramatic arts under Kemp, from avant-garde theatre and mime to commedia dell'arte, Bowie became immersed in the creation of personae to present to the world. Satirising life in a British prison, meanwhile, the Bowie-penned [...] "Over the Wall We Go" [...] became a 1967 single for Oscar; another Bowie composition, [...] "Silly Boy Blue", was released by Billy Fury the following year. In January 1968, Kemp choreographed a dance scene for a BBC play The Pistol Shot in the Theatre 625 series, and used Bowie with a dancer, Hermione Farthingale; the pair began dating, and moved into a London flat together. Playing acoustic guitar, Farthingale formed a group with Bowie and guitarist John Hutchinson; between September 1968 and early 1969 the trio gave a small number of concerts combining folk, Merseybeat, poetry and mime. Bowie and Farthingale broke up in early 1969 when she went to Norway {{to take part in a}} film, Song of Norway; this affected him, and several songs, such as [...] "Letter to Hermione" [...] and [...] "Life on Mars?" [...] reference her, and for the video accompanying [...] "Where Are We Now?" [...] he wore a T-shirt with the words [...] "m/s Song of Norway". They were last together in January 1969 for the filming of Love You till Tuesday, a 30-minute film that was not released until 1984: intended as a promotional vehicle, it featured performances from Bowie's repertoire, including [...] "Space Oddity", which had not been released when the film was made.|$|E

He was sorry for the rest of his life that Mrs. White had been killed. He wrote in his Memoirs: [...] "In camp was found a book, the first of the kind <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen,</b> in which I was made a great hero, slaying Indians by the hundreds ... I have often thought that Mrs. White read the same ... for my appearance that she might be saved." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Myron Diduryk’s {{first tour}} of duty in Vietnam he served as the company {{commander}} of Bravo Company 2nd Battalion, 7th Cavalry Regiment, 1st Cavalry Division (Airmobile).

It was 3 p.m., and through swirling cloud they glimpsed another razor-sharp ice ridge descending eastwards down to a col before curving gracefully upwards towards the Dome du Gouter. Grove recalled: [...] "I thought it the most terrific [...] thing <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>ever</b> <b>seen</b> in the Alps, but I am perfectly aware that a highly exaggerated impression {{is likely to be}} received of a ridge seen by half-frozen men {{in the middle of a}} tremendous storm, from the summit of a virgin peak".|$|E
