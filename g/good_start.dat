5|$|In 2010 the Crusaders {{had a very}} <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to {{the season}} before a poor finish with three losses in four games caused them to have to travel to Orlando Stadium, Soweto to face the Bulls. They lost the semi-final 39–24.|$|E
5|$|New rider Juan José Haedo {{gave the}} team a <b>good</b> <b>start</b> by winning early minor races. The {{classics}} season {{was a success}} by having O'Grady win Paris–Roubaix.

5|$|Although {{this was}} a <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> Hastings was not a {{particularly}} well-known barrister, and cases were few and far between. To get around the lack of funds Hastings accepted a pupil, {{and for the next}} year Hastings lived almost exclusively off the fees that the pupil paid him. To maintain the appearance of an active and busy chamber Hastings had his clerk borrow papers from other barristers and give them to the pupil to work on, claiming that they were cases of Hastings.|$|E

After a <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> Gehrig went through a long slump and suffered depression which led him to consider quitting baseball. Upon hearing this, Krichell was sent to Hartford {{to speak with the}} star player. He discovered that Gehrig was drinking, boosted his confidence and gave him batting advice, including one of Ty Cobb's batting tricks.

5|$|Another former Hibernian player, John Hughes, {{was soon}} {{appointed}} {{in place of}} Paatelainen. Hughes, who made high-profile signings such as Anthony Stokes and Liam Miller, led Hibs to a <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to the 2009–10 season. Hibs finished fourth and qualified for the 2010–11 UEFA Europa League. A poor start to the following season, including first round exits in Europe and the League Cup, led to Hughes leaving the club by mutual consent. Hughes was replaced by Colin Calderwood, who was himself sacked on 6 November 2011.|$|E
5|$|Bayern {{got off to}} a <b>good</b> <b>start</b> under Ancelotti, {{defeating}} Dortmund 2–0 in the 2016 DFL-Supercup. Despite being {{eliminated in}} the quarter-finals of the Champions League by Real Madrid and the semi-finals of the DFB-Pokal by Borussia Dortmund, they managed to clinch a fifth consecutive Bundesliga title with three matches remaining following a 6–0 away win over VfL Wolfsburg. Ancelotti was sacked by Bayern on 28 September 2017 and replaced by interim manager Willy Sagnol, following a 3–0 loss to PSG in the 2017–18 Champions League group stage and a slow start to the Bundesliga season that found them in third place.|$|E
5|$|Because California {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Virginia Tech's Mike Imoh fielded the ball at the goal line and returned it 40yards. Bryan Randall {{got off to a}} <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> completing two passes for 26yards, and Kevin Jones ran the ball another 16yards. After pushing inside the California red zone, however, the California defense stiffened and Tech was prevented from gaining another first down. Kicker Carter Warley attempted his third field goal of the game—this one a 28-yard kick—but as before, the kick was no good.|$|E

5|$|Benzema {{got off to}} a <b>good</b> <b>start</b> for the 2008–09 season, scoring {{twice in}} Lyon's opening league match against Toulouse. The {{following}} three weeks, he scored goals against Rhône-Alpes rivals Grenoble and Saint-Étienne and scored a goal against Nice, converting a penalty in the dying seconds. Lyon won all three matches. As a result of his early goals, Lyon club president Jean-Michel Aulas quelled the many transfer rumors surrounding Benzema by placing a €100million price tag on the striker. He was also nominated alongside Franck Ribéry to be featured on the French cover of the video game FIFA 09.|$|E
5|$|By 1979, Nea Salamina was {{established}} in the first division. Despite a <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to the 1978–79 season, the team was demoted in the decisive last game to the second division after a quarter-century in the first division. The team's hopes rested both on defeating Enosis Neon Paralimni FC and Evagoras Paphos not to beat AC Omonia or Olympiakos Nicosia FC to lose by Alki Larnaca F.C.. Nea Salamina won over Enosis Neon Paralimni FC (3–2), but none of the others happened as Evagoras won and Olympiakos tied with Alki.|$|E
5|$|Craig made a <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to {{the tour}} in two warm-up matches against Rhodesia, scoring a century in each match. Australia won the matches by an innings and ten wickets respectively. Craig led his men in five {{first-class}} matches before the Tests and Australia won all by convincing margins; three ended in innings victories {{and the others}} were won by nine and ten wickets. This included a match against a South African XI, in which Craig scored 88 as Australia amassed 8/519 declared before winning by an innings.|$|E

McCall released 13players from his squad and {{replaced them with}} a number of signings with experience in a higher division, as well as Michael Boulding, who was one of League Two's top goalscorers during the 2007–08 campaign. McCall's side made a <b>good</b> <b>start</b> to the season, and after winning five of their opening six league games, went top of the league – the first time City had led the table in seven years.|$|E
5|$|During 1932 Cochet {{restricted}} {{his schedule}} to appearances at Monaco Cups, the French Championships, Wimbledon, U.S. National Championships and the Davis Cup and a minor tournament in Paris. In Monaco the Butler Trophy were won by Cochet and Jacques Brugnon over the Czechoslovakian duo of Roderich Menzel and Ferenc Marsalek. The mixed doubles was granted to Cochet and Colette Rosambert following {{the retirement of}} Béla von Kehrling and Elizabeth Ryan prior to the match due to the leg pain of Ryan. After that <b>good</b> <b>start</b> Cochet was ranked number one by Pierre Gillou right ahead of Ellsworth Vines and Bunny Austin.|$|E
5|$|Miami {{got off to}} a <b>good</b> <b>start</b> {{doing just}} that as it raced out to four {{consecutive}} wins to begin the season, including a victory over nationally ranked rival No. 9 Florida State. On October 11, however, Miami traveled to South Bend, Indiana, to face the Notre Dame Fighting Irish and suffered its first loss of the season to the undefeated Irish, who would go on to be ranked No. 1 in the country. This defeat was followed in succession by two others, but the Hurricanes were able to stop the slide on November 8 with a homecoming win over East Carolina. Miami added two more wins {{before the end of the}} season, and brought the regular season to a close with an overall record of 83.|$|E

5|$|On March 25, 2010, Butler faced top-seeded Syracuse. The Bulldogs {{got off to}} a <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> {{jumping out}} to a 12–1 lead and a 35–25 halftime advantage. Syracuse rallied in the second half, taking its first lead of the game, 40–39, off a Wes Johnson three-pointer. Stevens called timeout and Butler regained the lead on its next possession, {{stopping}} the run. At the 5:32 mark, Syracuse got a rare fast break opportunity that ended with a dunk and 54–50 lead. Stevens again called time out and re-focused the team. Butler responded by holding Syracuse scoreless for the next 5 minutes, taking a 60–54 lead with 0:59 to go. Butler held on to win 63–59, advancing to the Elite Eight {{for the first time in}} school history.|$|E
5|$|Poor {{performances}} in the 1968/69 cup competitions meant Liverpool had less fixture congestion than the previous season. They {{finished second in the}} 1968–69 Football League six points behind Leeds United. Left back, Gerry Byrne, retired after 333appearances and 12 seasons. Shankly started replacing ageing players in his squad, purchasing future captain Emlyn Hughes and goalkeeper Ray Clemence the season before. Tony Hateley joined for a club record fee of £96,000 from Chelsea, but transferred after a year to Coventry City after injury and poor form. Mid-season Shankly signed Alun Evans from Wolverhampton Wanderers for a then record £100,000 fee for a teenager. After a <b>good</b> <b>start,</b> Evans' career was curtailed by injuries.|$|E
