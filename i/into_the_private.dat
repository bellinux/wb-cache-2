5|$|Amid {{the growing}} neo-liberal, Thatcherite {{economic}} changes brought about under the Premiership of Margaret Thatcher, he moved <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> sector {{to work for}} the London Docklands Development Corporation from 1981 to 1985, when he retired. As part of this he took a role in Europe's largest urban regeneration project, proposing a mix of redevelopment and conservation of existing buildings, using this mixed method to create a design guide for the regeneration of the Isle of Dogs. In this position he also campaigned for the Docklands Light Railway and oversaw the exterior refurbishment of St George in the East.|$|E

5|$|The Stella power {{stations}} were {{a pair of}} now-demolished coal-fired {{power stations}} in the North East of England that were a landmark in the Tyne valley for over 40years. The stations stood {{on either side of}} a bend of the River Tyne: Stella South power station, the larger, near Blaydon in Gateshead, and Stella North power station near Lemington in Newcastle. Their name originated from the nearby Stella Hall, a manor house close to Stella South that by the time of their construction had been demolished and replaced by a housing estate. They operated from shortly after the nationalisation of the British electrical supply industry until two years after the Electricity Act of 1989, when the industry passed <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> sector.|$|E
5|$|Each episode {{typically}} follows Bauer, {{officials in}} the U.S. government, and the conspirators behind {{the events of the}} day, often simultaneously. 24 is known for employing plot twists which may arise as antagonists adapt, objectives evolve or larger-scale operations unfold. Stories also involve interpersonal drama, delving <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> lives of the characters. As part of a recurring theme, characters are frequently confronted with ethical dilemmas. Examples of this are a bombing in Season 2, which can only be prevented by blowing Bauer's cover, and an ultimatum in Season 3, in which a terrorist agrees not to carry out an attack if a high-ranking CTU official is killed. Season 4 is also notable for a scene in which two men — one of whom possesses crucial information — are dying in a room with only one surgeon.|$|E

25|$|Ganesh Pol, or the Ganesh Gate, {{named after}} the Hindu god Lord Ganesh, who removes all {{obstacles}} in life, is the entry <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> palaces of the Maharajas. It is a three-level structure with many frescoes that was also built at the orders of the Mirza Raja Jai Singh (1621–1627). Above this gate is the Suhag Mandir where ladies {{of the royal family}} used to watch functions held in the Diwan-i-Aam through latticed windows.|$|E

25|$|Furthermore, {{government}} policy to reduce identity to “just a Rwandan one” has only “been {{successful in the}} public sphere of government rhetoric and bureaucracy.” In fact, ethnicity still remains socially relevant. Its salience however has been transferred <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> sphere—a space that may make the divisions even more destructive. Thus, the concept of “eliminating” ethnicity is problematic in both concept and reality—as it is unreasonable to expect such a drastic change in the Rwandan perception.|$|E
25|$|Desperate {{to avoid}} formal {{sanctions}} {{and to get}} off the FATF blacklist, the BSP spearheaded another lobby, this time to legislate a law that would criminalize money-laundering and create an anti-money-laundering body, as required by the FATF. The process, however, proved to be more complicated than anticipated. Buenaventura was repeatedly attacked by irate congressmen, who accused the BSP of attempting to amass power that would allow it to poke <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> accounts of individuals it considered suspicious. Legislators did not want the BSP peeking into private accounts, fearing that such power would be used as a political tool to ferret out ill-gotten wealth that was being laundered through banks.|$|E
25|$|The new {{legislation}} {{was intended to}} enable British Telecommunications to become more responsive to competition in GB and to expand its operations globally. Commercial freedom granted to British Telecommunications allowed it to enter into new joint ventures and, if it so decided, {{to engage in the}} manufacture of its own apparatus. The company's transfer <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> sector continued in December 1991 when the Government sold around half its remaining holding of 47.6% of shares, reducing its stake to 21.8%. Substantially all the government's remaining shares were sold in a third flotation in July 1993, raising £5billion for the Treasury and introducing 750,000 new shareholders to the company.|$|E

25|$|The bus {{operators}} now funded {{their operations}} via a State Government subsidy, partially {{funded by the}} sale of multi-modal Met Tickets (rather than each bus company issuing their own tickets) which are {{commonly referred to as}} a 'Myki'. In another attempt to reduce costs beyond the 'go or grow' policy, the State Government refused to subsidise new capital investment <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> bus companies (for instance, spending on new depots) and put a moratorium on the subsidies on bus replacement. Any new additions to the fleets of bus companies would have to be covered out-of-pocket by the bus companies themselves. This policy led to the dilapidation of the bus fleet through the late 1980s and into the 1990s, though would later be lifted.|$|E
25|$|The {{traditional}} {{basis for}} municipal finance is local property tax levied {{on real estate}} within the city. Local government can also collect revenue for services, or by leasing land that it owns. However, financing municipal services, as well as urban renewal and other development projects, is a perennial problem, which cities address through appeals to higher governments, arrangements with the private sector, and techniques such as privatization (selling services to <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> sector), corporatization (formation of quasi-private municipally-owned corporations), and financialization (packaging city assets into tradable financial instruments and derivatives). This situation has become acute in deindustrialized cities and in cases where businesses and wealthier citizens have moved outside of city limits and therefore {{beyond the reach of}} taxation. Cities in search of ready cash increasingly resort to the municipal bond, essentially a loan with interest and a repayment date. City governments have also begun to use tax increment financing, in which a development project is financed by loans based on future tax revenues which it is expected to yield. Under these circumstances, creditors and consequently city governments place a high importance on city credit ratings.|$|E
25|$|Between 2001 and 2011 {{shares in}} Tottenham Hotspur F.C. were {{listed on the}} Alternative Investment Market (AIM index). The {{majority}} shareholder, ENIC International Ltd, is an investment company established by the British billionaire Joe Lewis. Daniel Levy, Lewis's partner at ENIC, is Executive Chairman of the club. They had acquired 29.9% after buying 27% share of the club for £22 million from Sugar in 1991. Shareholding by ENIC increased over the decade through {{the purchase of the}} remaining 12% holding of Alan Sugar in 2007 for £25m, and the 9.9% stake belonging to Stelios Haji-Ioannou through Hodram Inc in 2009. On 21 August 2009 the club reported that they had issued a further 30 million shares to fund the initial development costs of the new stadium project, and that 27.8million of these new shares had been purchased by ENIC. The Annual Report for 2010 indicated that ENIC had acquired 76% of all Ordinary Shares and also held 97% of all convertible redeemable preference shares, equivalent to a holding of 85% of share capital. Following an announcement at the 2011 AGM, in January 2012 the club confirmed that they had been transferred <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> ownership of ENIC.|$|E

25|$|Below {{the level}} of the shire each county was divided into areas known as {{hundreds}} (or wapentakes in the north of England). These were original groups of families rather than geographical areas. The Hundred Court was a smaller version of the shire, presided over by the hundred bailiff, formerly a sheriff's appointment, but over the years many hundreds fell <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> hands of a local large landowner. We are not well-informed about Hundred Court business, which must have been a mix of the administrative and judicial, but they remained in some areas an important forum for the settlement of local disputes well into the post-Conquest period. The Anglo-Saxon system put an emphasis upon compromise and arbitration: litigating parties were enjoined to settle their differences if at all possible. If they persisted in bringing a case for decision before a Shire Court then it could be determined there. The suitors of the court would pronounce a judgment which fixed how the case would be decided: legal problems were considered to be too complex and difficult for mere human decision and so proof or demonstration of the right would depend upon some irrational, non-human criterion. The normal methods of proof were oath-helping or the ordeal.|$|E
500|$|While Johnson {{campaigned on}} a {{platform}} of limited involvement in Vietnam and continuation of funding for social programs, Goldwater called for substantial cuts in social programs, suggesting that Social Security become optional, and suggested the use of nuclear weapons in Vietnam if necessary. Goldwater believed that the Tennessee Valley Authority should be sold <b>into</b> <b>the</b> <b>private</b> sector. On foreign policy, Goldwater's beliefs differed sharply from those of his opponent, who advocated limited involvement in Vietnam, maintaining that he would not send [...] "American boys nine or ten thousand miles from home to do what Asian boys ought to be doing for themselves." [...] Goldwater, however, accused Johnson and the Democratic party of having given in on the issue of Communist aggression.|$|E
500|$|The {{following}} day, {{there is}} another excursion to the Engineer ship, with David providing Weyland Corporation executive Meredith Vickers with a live stream of his own private investigation.

David and the rest of the team return to Prometheus when Holloway's infection from the mutagen becomes apparent, prompting Vickers to incinerate him with a flamethrower. David checks Shaw's vitals and informs her that she is [...] "pregnant", as a result of Holloway passing the mutagen to her when they had intercourse the night before.
