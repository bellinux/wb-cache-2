Like most of the others attending I flew in to Beijing, but two friends came by way of the old silk road through Pakistan, Nepal and western China. The idea of that trip catches something of the mythical dimension of any journey to the Middle Kingdom: although the academic circuits have been open since the early 1980 s, and the carpetbaggers have descended in droves on Shanghai, there's still a sense, pure orientalism as it may be, of entering a closed world. Nor was that sense untrue to my experience of talking and listening to Chinese academics and students. For a start, there's a feeling of risk: 'contact with foreigners' is a privilege and a danger, and tongues are guarded. But the greater closure is the more mundane matter of cultural difference. <b>How</b> <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>tell</b> a joke to a Chinese audience?

To capture a family in writing, then, one must be able to express the simultaneity of togetherness and selfhood, of dependence and independence...|$|E

To investigate this question, we analyzed rhetorical structures, discourse constituent parts and their coherence relations in deceptive and truthful news sample from NPR’s “Bluff the Listener”. Subsequently, we applied a vector space model to cluster the news by discourse feature similarity, achieving 63 % accuracy. Our predictive model is not significantly better than chance (56 % accuracy), though comparable to average human lie detection abilities (54 %). Methodological limitations and future improvements are discussed. The long-term goal is to uncover systematic language differences and inform the core methodology of the news verification system...|$|E

There {{has been}} great progress toward automatic methods for visual recognition, including fine-grained visual categorization in which the classes to be distinguished are very similar. In a task such as bird species recognition, automatic recognition systems can now exceed the performance of non-experts – most people are challenged to name a couple dozen bird species, let alone identify them. This leads us to the question, “Can a recognition system show humans {{what to look for}} when identifying classes (in this case birds) ? ” In the context of fine-grained visual categorization, we show that we can automatically determine which classes are most visually similar, discover what visual features distinguish very similar classes, and illustrate the key features in a way meaningful to humans. Running these methods on a dataset of bird images, we can generate a visual field guide to birds which includes a tree of similarity that displays the similarity relations between all species, pages for each species showing the most similar other species, and pages for each pair of similar species illustrating their differences. 1...|$|E
