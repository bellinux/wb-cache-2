50|$|This is a lapwing of {{lake and}} river banks or open grassland. It {{has benefited from}} the {{extension}} of the latter habitat through widespread cattle ranching. When nesting in the vicinity of airports, it poses a threat to the safety of aerial traffic. Its food is mainly insects and other small invertebrates, hunted using a run-and-wait technique mainly at night, often in flocks. In urban areas like Rio de Janeiro and Montevideo it can even be seen feeding on floodlit soccer pitches during televised matches. The southern lapwing breeds on grassland and sometimes ploughed fields, and has an aerobatic <b>flapping</b> <b>display</b> flight. It lays 2-3 (rarely 4) olive-brown eggs in a bare ground scrape. The nest and young are defended noisily and aggressively against all intruders (including humans) by means of threats, vocalizations and low flights. After the breeding season it disperses into wetlands and seasonally-flooded tropical grassland.|$|R

40|$|Background: Pedicled {{skin and}} {{fasciocutaneous}} flaps {{are commonly used}} in plastic surgery. Once such a flap is completely raised on its pedicle it becomes defenceless against any possible necrosis. Aim: To use a simple method for raising such a flap {{in a manner that}} can predict the vascularity better, offering additional protection against necrosis. Materials and Methods: A total of 30 skin and fasciocutaneous flaps were raised in 27 patients. They were raised as bipedicle flaps; and the vascularity of the flap was tested by occluding the additional pedicle with a pedicle occlusion clamp. If the vascularity was found to be satisfactory the flap was primarily transferred; if found unsatisfactory it was either delayed or abandoned. The delayed flaps were again tested during transfer. Results: Nineteen (63. 3 %) flaps were primarily transferred, 11 (36. 7 %) flaps were delayed, and two (6. 7 %) delayed <b>flaps</b> <b>displayed</b> an unsatisfactory pattern during transfer. Twenty-two (73. 3 %) flaps fully survived and seven (23. 3 %) underwent partial thickness necrosis at the tip, which healed without any further surgical intervention, making 29 (96. 7 %) flaps clinically successful. There was major necrosis of one flap. All the flaps with a scar at the base survived. Discussion: The clinical success of 96. 7 % indicated a high-degree of predictability of flap survival through this method. Also, this method could safely assess the vascularity of flaps during primary transfer, during delayed transfer, and also those with a scar at the base. Conclusions: This technique is recommended in all major pedicled skin and fasciocutaneous flaps...|$|R
40|$|The halokinetic {{structure}} of inverted salt-related continental margins is frequently obliterated by compressional overprinting. The Cretaceous Sopeira and Sant Gervàs subbasins of the Ribagorça Basin (south central Pyrenees) show evidence of salt-related extensional tectonics and diapiric growth along the Iberian Margin of the Mesozoic Pyrenean rift. We present an integrated field-based tectonic-sedimentary study {{to reconstruct the}} evolution of the Ribagorça Basin system previous to, and in the early stages of, the Pyrenean orogeny. The 4 km thick Albian-Cenomanian Sopeira minibasin infill thins toward the basin borders, especially toward the eastern, N-S trending, Llastarri salt weld. The 90 ° tilt to the south of the Sopeira basin bottom records the growth of the buried north dipping Sopeira listric fault from Albian to Santonian times, when it evolved as an extensional rollover associated with the Aulet salt roller. The 3 km thick Cenomanian-Campanian succession filling the Sant Gervàs <b>flap</b> <b>displays</b> 130 ° bed fanning attitude from overturned Cenomanian carbonate platform strata to upright Campanian turbidite beds. The Sant Gervàs flap development since Cenomanian times was related to the fall of a large salt pillow after the main Soperia minibasin stage. Jurassic-Campanian diachronous subsidence is also observed in the adjacent Montiberri, Faiada, and Tamurcia depocenters. Correlation with the Pedraforca, Cotiella, and Basque-Cantabrian Basins along the southern Pyrenees suggests that a significant segment of the Iberian side of the Pyrenean rift experienced a gravity-driven extension from Albian to late Santonian. The Ribagorça Basin provides an excellent field analogue for presently buried salt-related structures of extended passive margins.

However, knowledge of postischemic myocutaneous revascularization in these models is limited. Materials and methods: A myocutaneous flap was created on the dorsum of wild type (C 57 BL/ 6), genetically obese and diabetic (ob/ob, db/db), complementary heterozygous (ob+/ob−, db+/db−), and diet-induced obese (DIO) mice (n= 48 total; five operative mice per strain and three unoperated mice per strain as controls). Flap perfusion was documented by laser speckle contrast imaging. Local gene expression in control and postoperative flap tissue specimens was determined by quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). Image analysis of immunochemically stained histologic sections confirmed microvascular density and macrophage presence. Results: Day 10 planimetric analysis revealed mean flap surface area necrosis values of 10. 8 %, 12. 9 %, 9. 9 %, 0. 4 %, 1. 4 %, and 23. 0 % for wild type, db+/db−, ob+/ob−, db/db, ob/ob, and DIO flaps, respectively. Over 10 days, laser speckle imaging documented increased perfusion at all time points with revascularization to supranormal perfusion in db/db and ob/ob flaps. In contrast, wild type, heterozygous, and DIO <b>flaps</b> <b>displayed</b> expected graded ischemia with failure of perfusion to return to baseline values. RT-PCR demonstrated statistically significant differences in angiogenic gene expression between lean and obese mice at baseline (unoperated) and at day 10. Conclusion: Unexpected increased baseline skin perfusion and augmented myocutaneous revascularization accompanied by a control proangiogenic transcriptional signature in genetically obese mice compared to DIO and lean mice are reported. In future research, laser speckle imaging has been planned to be utilized in order to correlate spatiotemporal wound reperfusion with changes in cell recruitment and gene expression {{to better understand the}} differences in wound microvascular biology in lean and obese states.

40|$|Some biomechanical {{studies from}} fossil {{specimens}} suggest that sustained flapping flight of birds could {{have appeared in}} their Mesozoic ancestors. We challenge this idea because a suitable musculoskeletal anatomy {{is not the only}} requirement for sustained flapping flight. We propose the "heart to fly" hypothesis that states that sustained flapping flight in modern birds required an enlargement of the heart for the aerobic performance of the flight muscles and test it experimentally by studying tinamous, the living birds with the smallest hearts. The small ventricular size of tinamous reduces cardiac output without limiting perfusion pressures, but when challenged to fly, the heart is unable to support aerobic metabolism (quick exhaustion, larger lactates and post-exercise oxygen consumption and compromised thermoregulation). At the same time, cardiac growth shows a crocodilian-like pattern and is correlated with differential gene expression in MAPK kinases. We integrate this physiological evidence in a new evolutionary scenario in which the ground-up, short and not sustained <b>flapping</b> flight <b>displayed</b> by tinamous represents an intermediate step {{in the evolution of the}} aerobic sustained flapping flight of modern birds...|$|R
50|$|Although {{externally}} {{very similar}} to the preceding Z1 and Z2-class trams they had significant design differences, and were a significant improvement on the Z1 and Z2-class trams.

40|$|With {{the pursuit}} of more {{advanced}} and environmentally-friendly technologies of today’s society, the airline industry has been pushed further to investigate solutions that will reduce airport noise and congestion, cut down on emissions, and improve the overall performance of aircraft. These items directly influence airport size (runway length), flight patterns in the community surrounding the airport, cruise speed, and many other aircraft design considerations which are setting the requirements for next generation aircraft. Leading the research in this movement is NASA, which has set specific goals {{for the next generation}} regional airliners and has categorized the designs that meet the criteria as Cruise Efficient Short Takeoff and Land (CESTOL) aircraft. With circulation control (CC) technology addressing most of the next generation requirements listed above, it has recently been gaining more interest, thus the basis of this research. CC is an active flow control method that uses a thin sheet of high momentum jet flow ejected over a curved trailing edge surface and in turn utilizes Coanda effect to increase the airfoil’s circulation, augmenting lift, drag, and pitching moment. The technology has been around for more than 75 years, but is now gaining more momentum for further development due to its significant payoffs in both performance and system complexity. The goal of this research was to explore the design of the CC flap shape and how it influences the local flow field of the system, in attempt to improve the performance of existing CC flap configurations and provide insight into the aerodynamic characteristics of the geometric parameters that make up the CC flap. Multiple dual radius flaps and alternative flap geometry, prescribed radius, flaps were developed by varying specific flap parameters from a baseline dual radius flap configuration that had been previously developed and researched. The aerodynamics of the various flap geometries were analyzed at three different flight conditions using two-dimensional CFD. The flight conditions examined include two low airspeed cases with blown flaps at 60 ° and 90 ° of deflection, and a transonic cruise case with no blowing and 0 ° of flap deflection. Results showed that the shorter flaps of both flap configurations augmented greater lift for the low airspeed cases, with the dual radius flaps producing more lift than the corresponding length prescribed radius. The large lift generation of these flaps was accompanied by significant drag and negative pitching moments. The incremental lift per drag and moment produced was best achieved by the longer flap lengths, with the prescribed radius flaps out-performing each corresponding dual radius. Longer flap configurations also upheld the better cruise performance with the least amount of low airspeed flow, drag, and required angle of attack for a given cruise lift coefficient. The prescribed radius flaps also presented a favorable trait of keeping a more continuous skin friction distribution over the flap when the flaps were deflected, where all dual radius configurations experienced a distinct fluctuation at the location where the surface curvature changes between its two radii. The prescribed radius <b>flaps</b> <b>displayed</b> a similar behavior when the flaps were not deflected, during the cruise conditions analyzed. Performance trends for the different flap configurations, at all three flight conditions, are presented {{at the end of each}} respective section to provide guidance into the design of CC geometry. The results of the presented research show promise in modifying geometric surface parameters to yield improved aerodynamics and performance...|$|R

40|$|The {{protease}} from type 1 {{human immunodeficiency}} virus (HIV- 1) is a critical drug target against which many therapeutically useful inhibitors have been developed; however, the set of viral strains in the population has been shifting to become more drug-resistant. Because indirect effects are contributing to drug resistance, {{an examination of the}} dynamic structures of a wild-type and a mutant could be insightful. Consequently, this study examined structural properties sampled during 22 nsec, all atom molecular dynamics (MD) simulations (in explicit water) of both a wild-type and the drug-resistant V 82 F/I 84 V mutant of HIV- 1 protease. The V 82 F/I 84 V mutation significantly decreases the binding affinity of all HIV- 1 protease inhibitors currently used clinically. Simulations have shown that the curling of the tips of the active site flaps immediately results in flap opening. In the 22 -nsec MD simulations presented here, more frequent and more rapid curling of the mutant’s active site flap tips was observed. The mutant protease’s flaps also opened farther than the wild-type’s <b>flaps</b> did and <b>displayed</b> more flexibility. This suggests that the effect of the mutations on the equilibrium between the semiopen and closed conformations could be one aspect of the mechanism of drug resistance for this mutant.

2500|$|Maratus {{species are}} small spiders, {{with a total}} body length mostly around 4–5mm (0.2in), {{sometimes}} smaller, {{with a high degree}} of sexual dimorphism. They are known as Peacock Spiders, based on the peacock-like display of the dorsal (upper) surface of the abdomen (opisthosoma) of the males, on which there is a [...] "plate" [...] or [...] "fan" [...] of usually brightly colored and highly iridescent scales and hairs, often forming patterns in which the foreground colors contrast with the iridescent background. There may in addition be [...] "flaps" [...] or dense fringes of hairs at the sides of the abdomen, sometimes brightly colored. In both sexes, the abdomen is joined to the cephalothorax by a long and very flexible pedicel. This allows males to raise their abdomens, which may also be capable of being flattened and waved from side to side, thus emphasizing the appearance of the dorsal pattern. Not all species have colors that appear bright to human vision; Maratus vespertilio is relatively cryptically colored, with most iridescence on the lateral <b>flaps.</b> The abdominal <b>display</b> is used in courtship and, in at least one species, also in aggressive interactions with rival males. In almost all species, males have relatively long third legs, often brightly patterned, that are also used in courtship displays. Salticid spiders have excellent vision, with the ability to see in at least two colors: green and ultraviolet (UV). The male display includes vibratory signals in addition to visual ones. At least one species (Maratus fimbriatus) displays with its first pair of legs rather than its third pair. Some Maratus including Maratus calcitrans, Maratus digitatus and Maratus jactatus display with greatly enlarged and decorated spinnerets when their abdomen is elevated. One species from Cape Riche, Western Australia, in a region which is something of a hot-spot for Maratus species, does not use its abdomen in its display at all, instead using a combination of decorated third legs and its bright blue face and fluffy white pedipalps.|$|R
