The solid samples I dried at 423 K and II heated at 1073 K in the amorphous and crystalline form, respectively, were studied in the temperature range 383  423 K. The dispersive components of the surface free energies, enthalpies, entropies, and the acid/base constants for the solidswere calculated from the IGC measurements and compared with the data for a commercially available chromia (III).

Applying {{self-assembly}} properties of surfactants to nanomaterials manipulation {{may be the}} key to the fast, easy, cost-effective growth of 2 D and 3 D nanostructures. Newton black films (NBFs) are self-assembled bilayers of surfactant, well-organized, but fragile objects. To render such films amenable to practical applications, it is necessary to find ways to transfer them onto solid substrates. A method developed recently to transfer NBFs onto a solid substrate while preserving their molecular organization (Benattar, J. -J.; Nedyalkov, M.; Lee, F. K.; Tsui, O. K. C. Angew. Chem., Int.

40|$|The {{peculiar}} bi-lobed {{shape of}} comet 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko {{has raised the}} core {{question as to whether}} this is either the expression of two once-distinct objects or the result of a localized excavation on the outgassing region at the interface between the two lobes. The widespread layering involving most of the comet’s surface gives an unambiguous answer to this conundrum. Here we show that the major lobe (the main body) of the comet is enveloped by a nearly continuous set of layers, up to 650 m thick, which is independent from an analogous layered envelope on the minor lobe (the head). Gravity vectors computed for the two lobes separately are nearly perpendicular to the layers while gravity vectors of the entire nucleus diverge from perpendicular toward the neck, separating the two lobes. Therefore 67 P/Churyumov-Gerasimenko is an accreted body of two distinct objects with “onion-like” layered envelopes, formed before they merged. Our analysis provides compelling evidence that gentle low-velocity collisions occurred between fully formed km-sized cometessimals {{in the early stages of}} the Solar System. In addition, the striking structural similarities between the two lobes, together with the established compositional <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface,</b> indicate that early forming cometessimals experienced a similar primordial layering accretion, having formed completely independently...|$|E

40|$|Many {{techniques}} rely on {{the binding}} activity of surface-immobilized proteins, including antibody-based affinity biosensors {{for the detection of}} analytes, immunoassays, protein arrays, and surface plasmon resonance biosensors for the study of thermodynamic and kinetic aspects of protein interactions. To study the functional <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> sites and to characterize their binding properties, we have recently proposed a computational tool to determine the distribution of affinity and kinetic rate constants from surface binding progress curves. It is based on modeling the experimentally measured binding signal as a superposition of signals from binding to sites spanning a range of rate and equilibrium constants, with regularization providing the most parsimonious distribution consistent with the data. In the present work, we have expanded the scope of this approach to include a compartment-like transport step, which can describe competitive binding to different surface sites in a zone of depleted analyte close to the sensor surface. This approach addresses a major difficulty in the analysis of surface binding where both transport limitation as well as unknown surface site heterogeneity may be present. In addition to the kinetic binding parameters of the ensemble of surface sites, it can provide estimates for effective transport rate constants. Using antibody-antigen interactions as experimental model systems, we studied the effects of the immobilization matrix and of the analyte flow-rate on the effective transport rate constant. Both were experimentally observed to influence mass transport. The approximate description of mass transport by a compartment model becomes critical when applied to strongly transport-controlled data, and we examined the limitations of this model. In the presence of only moderate mass transport limitation the compartment model provides a good description, but this approximation breaks down for strongly transport-limited surface binding. In the latter regime, we report experimental evidence for the formation of gradients within the sensing volume of the evanescent field biosensor used...|$|E

40|$|History {{has shown}} {{that many of the}} {{technological}} advances in micrometeorological measurement methods and techniques were facilitated by agronomic research into understanding plant–water relationships and photosynthesis (Deacon 2 ̆ 6 Swinbank, 1958; Lemon, 1960; Suomi 2 ̆ 6 Tanner, 1960; Tanner, 1960). Even today, many research programs are focusing on {{a better understanding of the}} water balance on regional and continental scales with a goal of providing useful probabilistic forecasts that will lead to more effective planning of the use of water resources in areas where water is limited or stricken by drought (Lawford, 1999). The need to understand and predict components of the water and carbon cycle on seasonal and annual time scales has pushed the micrometeorological technology to work not only for short duration intensive experiments, but for much longer periods (Baldocchi et al., 2001; Running et al., 1999; Grelle 2 ̆ 6 Lindroth, 1996). Many agricultural research activities include short-term intensive experiments in which the emission or deposition of some chemical species is to be quantified. Along with the more common species like water vapor and CO 2, fluxes of other chemical species have become important in agriculture. They include N compounds such as NH 3, HNO 3, NO, other greenhouse gases such as CH 4 and N 2 O, pollutants such as O 3 and SO 2, and many pesticides (Majewski et al., 1989). Measured fluxes also are being integrated during the year to compile annual budgets of water and C. Potential biases in the measured fluxes that could lead to potentially large errors in these annual budgets has spurred several efforts to re-examine the methodologies of current flux measurement techniques (Massman 2 ̆ 6 Lee, 2002), and how the data should be processed to insure the highest data integrity (Foken 2 ̆ 6 Wichura, 1995). Although key findings and recommendations from these articles will be discussed here, reading these articles is encouraged. Here, we will described the various micrometeorological methodologies that are currently used to determine the vertical turbulent fluxes of water, CO 2, and other scalar entities on both short and long time scales, incorporating the latest strategies on flux measurement techniques. There are many well-written historical articles and book chapters on micrometeorological methodologies (Webb, 1965; Kanemasu et al., 1979; Hicks, 1984). The reader is encouraged to read these references as these provide basic information on the fundamental processes of air-surface exchange, which is necessary to appreciate and understand the application of the various measurement methodologies. For many agricultural applications, micrometeorological methods are preferred since they are generally non-intrusive, can be applied on a semicontinuous basis, and provide information about vertical fluxes that are aerially averaged on scales ranging from tens of meters to several kilometers, depending on the roughness of the surface, the height of the instrumentation, and the stability of the atmosphere surface layer. Interpretations of the data obtained from these methods are also constrained by the assumptions of stationarity in the scalar concentration field, horizontal <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> conditions, and relatively flat terrain. These constraints insure that the vertical turbulent flux is due to the scalar source–sink at the surface and not by advective horizontal mean or turbulent fluxes. The most commonly used micrometeorological methods can be separated into four categories. They are: (i) eddy covariance, (ii) flux-gradient, (iii) accumulation, and (iv) mass balance. Each of these techniques are suited for applications that depend on the scalar of interest and surface type, over which the flux is to be measured. For example, the eddy covariance method can only be used for trace species for which fast response instrumentation is available. Likewise, flux gradient or accumulation methods are often used in systems for which the atmospheric concentrations can be determined with a high degree of accuracy using either slow response sensors or accumulation devices such as flasks, canisters, filter packs, or annular denuders. There are other methodologies that have been used to measure fluxes including the variance method (Padro, 1993) and the inertial dissipation technique (Fairall 2 ̆ 6 Larsen, 1986). These methods are usually applied in very special circumstances and cannot be necessarily generalized for all trace gases and environmental conditions. In this chapter, we will discuss the basics and strengths of the four methodologies above. Our intent is not to elaborate in detail on the theoretical derivations and complete historical background of these methods, but to discuss and describe how these can be used to measure fluxes on time scales that are pertinent to research in agriculture. There are many excellent reviews, both current and historical, that provide excellent background material that need not be repeated here...|$|E

Besides, the manufacturing process to produce the aluminium segments together with the electron welding technique ensure <b>the</b> material's <b>homogeneity.</b> Quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> condition will result from optimized implementation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> specific aluminium machining and polishing techniques. This paper highlights the existing aluminium realizations compared to glass mirrors, and gives the main results obtained during a feasibility demonstration phase, based on 8 m. mirror requirements...|$|R

In good agreement with experimental results, our simulation {{results indicate that}} there exists a transition growth in terms <b>of</b> <b>the</b> deposition rate that corresponds to the transition between the island growth and random deposition growth. In <b>the</b> regions <b>of</b> island growth (where the deposition rate is lower than 1. 1 Å s− 1) and random deposition growth (where the deposition rate is higher than 3 Å s− 1), <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> morphology is not suitable for luminant devices because of a high roughness, a larger inner vacancy ratio at higher deposition rate, and low homogeneity at lower deposition rate conditions. Within the transition growth region (deposition rate is between 1. 1 and 3. 0 Å s− 1), <b>the</b> <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> film <b>surface</b> improves as <b>the</b> deposition rate increases.

40|$|Individual and {{competitive}} adsorption studies {{were carried out}} to investigate <b>the</b> removal <b>of</b> phenol and nickel ions by adsorption onto multiwalled carbon nanotubes (MWCNTs). The carbon nanotubes were characterized by different techniques such as X-ray diffraction, scanning electron microscopy, thermal analysis and Fourier transformation infrared spectroscopy. The different experimental conditions affecting the adsorption process were investigated. Kinetics and equilibrium models were tested for fitting the adsorption experimental data. The characterization experimental results proved that the studied adsorbent possess different surface functional groups as well as typical morphological features. The batch experiments revealed that 300  min of contact time was enough to achieve equilibrium for <b>the</b> adsorption <b>of</b> both phenol and nickel at an initial adsorbate concentration of 25  mg/l, an adsorbent dosage of 5  g/l, and a solution pH <b>of</b> 7. <b>The</b> adsorption <b>of</b> phenol and nickel by MWCNTs followed the pseudo-second order kinetic model and the intraparticle diffusion model was quite good in describing the adsorption mechanism.

40|$|A {{method to}} {{estimate}} sea surface elevation maps from marine radar image sequences is presented. This method is <b>the</b> extension <b>of</b> an existing inverse modeling technique to derive wave spectra from marine radar images, which assumes linear wave theory with temporal stationarity and spatial <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> observed sea <b>surface</b> elevation. <b>The</b> proposed technique to estimate wave elevation maps {{takes into account}} a modulation transfer function (MTF), which describes the radar imaging mechanisms at grazing incidence and horizontal polarization.

The numerical simulations show that shadowing is the dominant effect in the radar imaging mechanism at grazing incidence and horizontal polarization.

The monitored factors for determining quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> prepared coatings are <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coating <b>surface</b> on ground and polished samples of magnesium alloy, mechanical properties <b>of</b> <b>the</b> coating (adhesion and hardness) and the coating thickness. The main parameter was the change in these properties at different exposition times <b>of</b> <b>the</b> material to the salt melt.

40|$|The {{chamfered}} mold with {{a typical}} corner shape (angle between the chamfered face and hot face is 45 deg) {{was applied to}} the mold simulator study in this paper, and the results were compared with the previous results from a well-developed right-angle mold simulator system. The results suggested that the designed chamfered structure would increase the thermal resistance and weaken the two-dimensional heat transfer around the mold corner, causing <b>the</b> <b>homogeneity</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> mold <b>surface</b> temperatures and heat fluxes. In addition, the chamfered structure can decrease <b>the</b> fluctuation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> steel level and the liquid slag flow around the meniscus at mold corner. The cooling intensities at different longitudinal sections of shell are close to each other due to the similar time-average solidification factors, which are 2. 392 mm/s 1 / 2 (section A-A: chamfered center), 2. 372 mm/s 1 / 2 (section B-B: 135 deg corner), and 2. 380 mm/s 1 / 2 (section D-D: face), respectively. For the same oscillation mark (OM), <b>the</b> heights <b>of</b> OM roots at different positions (profile L 1 (face), profile L 2 (135 deg corner), and profile L 3 (chamfered center)) are very close to each other. <b>The</b> average value <b>of</b> height difference (H D) between two OMs roots for L 1 and L 2 is 0. 22 mm, and for L 2 and L 3 is 0. 38 mm.

40|$|Resistors on {{aluminium}} nitride (AlN) are very interesting for microwave applications because <b>of</b> <b>the</b> high thermal conductivity and the excellent dielectric properties <b>of</b> AlN. During <b>the</b> firing process the conductive phase RuO 2 <b>of</b> <b>the</b> resistor film can react with AlN. This reaction depends on <b>surface</b> quality <b>of</b> <b>the</b> substrate as roughness and content {{and composition of}} yttrium aluminates which are formed if yttria is used as additive to AlN for sintering. The yttrium aluminates on <b>the</b> AlN <b>surfaces</b> were identified by X-ray diffraction and quantified by Rietvelt analysis. The interactions between the resistor and AlN were investigated by cross section, FESEM and EDX. Four kinds of surface states were microscopically found: tight AlN, AlN with pores, residuals of yttrium aluminate after treatment <b>of</b> <b>the</b> as-fired <b>surface</b> and yttrium aluminate crystallites embedded in AlN. Each of this state can show another interactions with the resistor film. If yttrium aluminate is on <b>the</b> AlN <b>surface</b> <b>the</b> reaction between RuO 2 and AlN is inhibited. On the other hand pores in the AlN increase the reaction rate. The resistance were related to <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> properties <b>of</b> AlN. High standard deviation of resistance was observed on some substrates. The reason for this phenomenon was investigated by different methods. The resistance correlates with <b>the</b> content <b>of</b> YAlO 3 on <b>the</b> substrate <b>surface.</b> <b>The</b> increased resistance {{can be explained by}} reaction between RuO 2 containing in the resistors as conductive phase and AlN. As result of this reaction Ru metal and gaseous nitrogen are formed. Four kinds of areas were microscopically identified: tight AlN, porous AlN, residuals of yttrium aluminates on <b>the</b> <b>surface</b> and crystallites <b>of</b> yttrium aluminate embedded in AlN. The reaction between RuO 2 and AlN on this four areas is different. A porous AlN surface accelerates and yttrium aluminates can inhibits this reaction.
