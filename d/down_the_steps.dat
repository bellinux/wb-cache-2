Similar, smaller verandas {{can be found on}} the other sides.|$|E
25|$|On Thursday, November 21, 1963, at 11:07 p.m., Air Force One lands at Carswell Air Force {{base on the}} {{outskirts}} of Fort Worth, Texas.

25|$|The first AAGPBL spring {{training}} outside the United States {{was held in}} 1947 in Havana, Cuba, {{as part of a}} plan to create an International League of Girls Baseball. The All-Americans stayed at the Seville-Biltmore Hotel, and they played their games at the Gran Stadium. They trained, played eight days of exhibitions, and were cheered by more than 75,000 baseball fanatics. All the teams were filmed for Fox News going <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> at the University of Havana.|$|E
25|$|The {{shooting}} {{inside the}} house lasted for five minutes. A patrol officer nearby, Steve Leonard, heard the shots {{and headed to the}} scene, getting the address from multiple 911 dispatches. When he got to the house, he encountered an injured victim and immediately got between the victim and the house, as Huff was coming <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b> Before the officer could complete his demand that Huff drop his weapon, Huff placed the gun in his mouth and shot himself through the head.|$|E
25|$|The most {{important}} existing communal shelters were the London Underground stations. Although many civilians had used them for shelter during the First World War, {{the government in}} 1939 refused to allow the stations {{to be used as}} shelters so as not to interfere with commuter and troop travel and the fears that occupants might refuse to leave. Underground officials were ordered to lock station entrances during raids but by the second week of heavy bombing, the government relented and ordered the stations to be opened. Each day orderly lines of people queued until 4:00 pm, when they were allowed to enter the stations. In mid-September 1940, about 150,000 people a night slept in the Underground, although by the winter and spring months the numbers had declined to 100,000 or less. Noises of battle were muffled and sleep was easier in the deepest stations but many people were killed from direct hits on stations. In March 1943, 173 men, women and children were crushed to death at Bethnal Green tube station in a panic after a woman fell <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> as she entered the station.|$|E
50|$|Skimming Flow RegimeUnder a {{skimming}} flow regime, water flows in a coherent stream <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>step.</b> Water skims <b>the</b> {{top of each}} step as it flows <b>down</b> <b>the</b> chute. Recirculating vortices are developed between each <b>step</b> which allow <b>the</b> water to flow {{over the top of}} the vortices and skim over each step.|$|R
60|$|An awkward {{minute for}} poor Phebe, but she showed {{unexpected}} {{presence of mind}} and left behind her a pretty picture {{of the oldest and}} youngest orphan as she went quickly <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> smiling over <b>the</b> great bouquet with the baby on her arm.|$|R

25|$|Caesar {{addressed}} {{the people and}} asked Marcus Calpurnius Bibulus, the other consul, if he disapproved of the law. Calpurnius Bibulus just {{said that he would}} not tolerate any innovations during his year of office. Caesar did not ask any questions to other officials. Instead he brought forward the two most influential men in Rome, Pompey and Crassus, who were private citizens. They both declared their support for the law. Caesar asked Pompey if he would help him against the opponents of the law. Pompey said that he would and Crassus seconded him. Bibulus, supported by three plebeian tribunes, obstructed the vote. When he ran out of excuses for delaying he declared a sacred period for all the remaining days of the year. This meant that the people could not legally even meet in their assembly. Caesar ignored him and set date for the vote. The senate met at the house of Calpurnius Bibulus because it had not been convened. It planned that Bibulus was to oppose the law so that it would look that the senate was overcome by force, rather than through inaction. On the day of the vote Bibulus forced {{his way through the crowd}} with his followers to the temple of Castor where Caesar was making his speech. When he tried to make a speech he and his followers were pushed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b> There was a scuffle and some of the tribunes were wounded. Bibulus defied some men who had daggers, but he was dragged away by his friends. Cato pushed through the crowd and tried to make a speech, but was lifted up and carried away by Caesar’s supporters. He made a second attempt, but nobody listened to him.|$|E
25|$|After Ryan {{was sentenced}} to Pentridge Prison, he was placed in B Division where he met fellow {{prisoner}} Peter John Walker (who was serving a 12-year sentence for bank robbery). When Ryan was informed {{that his wife was}} seeking a divorce, he made a plan to escape from prison. Walker decided to go along with him. Ryan planned to take himself and his family and flee to Brazil, which did not have an extradition treaty with Australia. At around 2:07pm on Sunday, 19 December 1965, Ryan and Walker put the escape plan into effect. As prison officers were taking turns attending a staff Christmas party in the officers' mess hall, Ryan and Walker scaled a five-metre prison wall with the aid of two wooden benches, a hook and blankets. Running {{along the top of the}} wall to a prison watch tower, they overpowered prison warder Helmut Lange and took his M1 carbine rifle. Ryan threatened Lange and demanded he pull the lever to open the prison tower gate. Lange, however, deliberately pulled the wrong lever. Ryan, Walker and Lange then proceeded <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> to the tower gate, but it would not open. At the bottom of the stairs was the night officers' lodge. Warder Fred Brown was returning from lunch to relieve Lange when he was confronted by the escapees. Brown did not resist. When Ryan realised Lange had tricked him, he jabbed the rifle into Lange's back and marched him back up the stairs so Lange could pull the correct lever to open the tower gate. The two escapees then exited through the gate into the prison car park. To the escapees' dismay there were only two cars in the car park and one had a flat tyre.|$|E
500|$|Hargrave: There is {{only one}} way in which such a {{government}} could be [...] "dissolved", and that is by sending in troops to throw it out, physically, neck and crop, <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of this parliament house.

50|$|The {{skimming}} flow regime is observed {{for the largest}} discharges. The waters skim over the pseudo-bottom formed by <b>the</b> <b>step</b> edges as a coherent turbulent flow. Beneath the pseudo-bottom some intense recirculation and vertical structures fill the cavities. These recirculation eddies are maintained by the transmission of shear stress from the mainstream and they contribute significantly to <b>the</b> energy dissipation <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>stepped</b> spillway.|$|R
60|$|Fergus was {{the first}} of the {{travellers}} to appear at Rockstone. Miss Mohun, who went to meet him at the station, beheld a small figure lustily pulling at a great canvas bag, which came bumping <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>step,</b> assisted by a shove from the other passengers, and threatening for a moment to drag him down between platform and carriages.|$|R

500|$|Film {{historian}} Joseph McBride considered O'Hara's {{performance to}} have been the most powerful and intense emotionally he'd seen since Katharine Hepburn in Mary of Scotland (1936). O'Hara stated that her favorite scene in the film took place outside the church after her character gets married, remarking, [...] "I make my way <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> to the carriage waiting below, the wind catches my veil and fans it out in a perfect circle all the way around my face. Then it floats straight up above my head and points to the heavens. It's breathtaking." ...|$|E
500|$|While fake frogs were {{considered}} for the scene where they fall from the sky, the producers decided {{to make use of}} real frogs instead, dropped from a short distance. According to Carter, the [...] "fake ones looked too bad and didn't hop away after command". The snake going down the stairs proved difficult to film as the animal kept on falling onto the floor after slithering <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps.</b> Actor Dan Butler was terrified of the animal, being unable to talk while shooting the scene in the basement. The actor's fright meant the make-up team did not need to apply fake sweat to his face.|$|E
500|$|The Monster comes <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> after killing Karl on {{the rooftop}} and sees his mate (Elsa Lanchester). The excited Monster reaches out to her, asking, [...] "Friend?" [...] The Bride, screaming, rejects him. [...] "She hate me! Like others" [...] the Monster dejectedly says. As Elizabeth races to Henry's side, the Monster rampages through the laboratory. The Monster tells Henry and Elizabeth [...] "Yes! Go! You live!" [...] To Pretorius and the Bride, he says [...] "You stay. We belong dead." [...] While Henry and Elizabeth flee, the Monster sheds a tear and pulls a lever to trigger the {{destruction}} of the laboratory and tower.|$|E

500|$|Starr leased Flat 1 in 1965, {{shortly before}} his {{marriage}} to Maureen Cox. It consisted of the ground floor and lower-ground floor (the cellar/basement in the original house), and entrance was gained by walking <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> leading to the lower-ground floor door, or the front door at ground level. The ground floor had an en-suite bathroom (with a pink bath sunk into the floor) a bedroom and a sitting room. Downstairs was a kitchen, a bathroom and a bedroom/sitting room, which had its original fireplace. A resident of the square, Lord Mancroft, welcomed Starr, saying to a journalist, [...] "We're a very distinguished square, and I'm sure we'll welcome such a distinguished gentleman and his lady." ...|$|E
500|$|At the party, Peter dresses up as [...] "Pee Pants the Inebriated Hobo Clown", [...] "an adorable tramp {{who wears}} found {{clothing}} and eats {{out of your}} garbage can". Peter then tells Meg that he got her a scarf for her birthday. Meg declines, while Peter then says he got her [...] "a dozen scarves" [...] which Peter then proceeds to regurgitate as one long scarf, as he has actually tied and swallowed them (which Lois says he {{was not supposed to}} do). This causes him to cough and vomit. Peter hands Meg the long scarf from his tongue, but Meg refuses to hold it. Peter then urges Meg to hold them, and then asks if his long johns are tied to the end of them. When Meg says they are not, Peter then says [...] "Oh, god" [...] and regurgitates them as well, and then crouches in pain following the ordeal. Meg asks Lois if she can open her gifts, and Meg notices Stewie opening most of them. Peter gets drunk, and attempts to ride a unicycle <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps,</b> but falls off and crushes his father, Francis, who later dies in the hospital from the accident. Just before Francis dies, he calls Peter [...] "a fat stinking drunk".|$|E
2500|$|This {{gave the}} {{hillside}} a very saturated appearance, {{and the water}} flowing <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> of the dam where it abutted the hill caused alarm among the canyon residents and others traveling on the road [...] to the east, as at that distance it appeared the water {{was coming from the}} abutment.|$|E

2500|$|In May 1960, {{the main}} Rotunda was {{a site of}} a student protest against the House Un-American Activities Committee and a {{countering}} police action whereby students from UC Berkeley, Stanford, and other local colleges were fire hosed <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> beneath the rotunda. [...] This event was memorialized by students during the Free Speech Movement at UC Berkeley four years later.|$|E
2500|$|Klebold walked <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> {{toward the}} cafeteria. He {{came up to}} Kirklin, who was already wounded and lying on the ground, weakly calling for help. Klebold said, [...] "Sure. I'll help you," [...] then shot Kirklin in the face, {{critically}} wounding him. Daniel Rohrbough and Sean Graves had descended the staircase when Klebold and Harris' attention was diverted by the students on the grass; Graves—paralyzed beneath the waist—had crawled into {{the doorway of the}} cafeteria's west entrance and collapsed. Klebold shot Rohrbough, who was already fatally wounded by the shots previously fired by Harris, at close range through the upper left chest and then stepped over the injured Sean Graves to enter the cafeteria. Officials speculated that Klebold went to the cafeteria to check on the propane bombs. Harris shot <b>down</b> <b>the</b> <b>steps</b> at several students sitting near the cafeteria's entrance, severely wounding and partially paralyzing 17-year-old Anne-Marie Hochhalter as she tried to flee. Klebold came out of the cafeteria and went back up the stairs to join Harris.|$|E
