He was gazetted a second lieutenant in early October 1914. Wilding remained in the Marines {{for just a few}} days and was then attached to the Intelligence Corps due to his intimate knowledge of the continent and his skills as a motorist.

After a week's leave in London in February 1915 he returned to France on 16 March 1915 and was posted to a new squadron made up of armoured Rolls Royce cars under the command of the Duke of Westminster. He was ranked a lieutenant. Before long the squadron was moved near the front and on 2 May Wilding received notice of his promotion to captain. In his last letter dated 8 May he wrote [...] "For really the first time in seven and a half months <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> on hand which is likely to end in gun, I, and the whole outfit being blown to hell.

5000|$|Davidson {{resigned}} from the NL staff in 1999 {{as part of a}} failed mass resignation during labor negotiations.
