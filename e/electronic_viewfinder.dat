5|$|Photographing {{an eclipse}} is {{possible}} with fairly common camera equipment. In {{order for the}} disk of the Sun/Moon to be easily visible, a fairly high magnification long focus lens is needed (at least 200mm for a 35mm camera), and for the disk to fill most of the frame, a longer lens is needed (over 500mm). As with viewing the Sun directly, looking at it through the optical viewfinder of a camera can produce damage to the retina, so care is recommended. Solar filters are required for digital photography even if an optical viewfinder is not used. Using a camera's live view feature or an <b>electronic</b> <b>viewfinder</b> is safe for the human eye, but the Sun's rays could potentially irreparably damage digital image sensors unless the lens is covered by a properly designed solar filter.|$|E
25|$|The reflex design {{scheme is}} the primary {{difference}} between a DSLR and other digital cameras. In the reflex design scheme, the image captured on the camera's sensor is also the image that is seen through the view finder. Light travels through a single lens and a mirror is used to reflect a portion of that light through the view finder – hence the name Single Lens Reflex. While there are variations among point-and-shoot cameras, the typical design exposes the sensor constantly to the light projected by the lens, allowing the camera's screen {{to be used as}} an <b>electronic</b> <b>viewfinder.</b> However, LCDs can be difficult to see in very bright sunlight.|$|E
25|$|Sony has {{modified}} the DSLR formula {{in favor of}} single-lens translucent (SLT) cameras, which are still technically DSLRs, but feature a fixed mirror that allows most light through to the sensor while reflecting some light to the autofocus sensor. Sony's SLTs feature full-time phase detection autofocus during video recording as well as continuous shooting of up to 12 frame/s. The α series, whether traditional SLRs or SLTs, offers in-body sensor-shift image stabilization and retains the Minolta AF lens mount. , the lineup included the Alpha 68, the semipro Alpha 77 II, and the professional full-frame Alpha 99 II. The translucent (transmissive) fixed mirror allows 70 percent of the light to pass through onto the imaging sensor, meaning a 1/3rd stop loss light, {{but the rest of}} this light is continuously reflected onto the camera's phase detection AF sensor for fast autofocus for both the viewfinder and live view on the rear screen, even during video and continuous shooting. The reduced number of moving parts also makes for faster shooting speeds for its class. This arrangement means that the SLT cameras use an <b>electronic</b> <b>viewfinder</b> as opposed to an optical viewfinder, which some consider a disadvantage, but does have the advantage of a live preview of the shot with current settings, anything displayed on the rear screen is displayed on the viewfinder, and handles bright situations well.|$|E

500|$|Thunderbirds Are Go is {{also the}} first film to have been shot with the [...] "Livingston <b>Electronic</b> <b>Viewfinder</b> Unit". Also known as [...] "Add-a-Vision", this system {{consisted}} of a viewfinder, connected to video monitors, {{that was used to}} capture an image directly from the shooting camera. This enabled production personnel to inspect filmed footage on the set with a higher definition than had been possible with a more basic system used for AP Films television series. Add-a-Vision also benefited the puppeteers, who were stationed several metres above the set on gantries and had until this point not been permitted a useful view of the marionette movements below them. Based on German video assist devices, Add-A-Vision was developed by John Read, director of photography for Thunderbirds, in collaboration with Prowest Electronics, and also incorporated a form of playback function to aid staff while viewing rushes.|$|E
2500|$|The larger, {{advanced}} {{digital cameras}} offer a non-optical electronic through-the-lens (TTL) view, via an eye-level <b>electronic</b> <b>viewfinder</b> (EVF) {{in addition to}} the rear LCD. The difference in view compared with a DSLR is that the EVF shows a digitally created image, whereas the viewfinder in a DSLR shows an actual optical image via the reflex viewing system. An EVF image has lag time (that is, it reacts with a delay to view changes) and has a lower resolution than an optical viewfinder but achieves parallax-free viewing using less bulk and mechanical complexity than a DSLR with its reflex viewing system. Optical viewfinders tend to be more comfortable and efficient, especially for action photography and in low-light conditions. Compared with digital cameras with LCD electronic viewfinders, there is no time lag in the image: it is always correct as it is being [...] "updated" [...] at the speed of light. This is important for action or sports photography, or any other situation where the subject or the camera is moving quickly. Furthermore, the [...] "resolution" [...] of the viewed image is much better than that provided by an LCD or an <b>electronic</b> <b>viewfinder,</b> which can be important if manual focusing is desired for precise focusing, as would be the case in macro photography and [...] "micro-photography" [...] (with a microscope). An optical viewfinder may also cause less eye-strain. However, electronic viewfinders may provide a brighter display in low light situations, as the picture can be electronically amplified.|$|E

50|$|In most cases, single-lens reflex cameras {{cannot be}} made as small or as light as other camera designs—such as {{rangefinder}} cameras, autofocus compact cameras and digital cameras with <b>electronic</b> <b>viewfinders</b> (EVF)—owing to the mirror box and pentaprism/pentamirror. The mirror box also prevents lenses with deeply recessed rear elements from being mounted close to the film or sensor unless the camera has a mirror lockup feature; this means that simple designs for wide angle lenses cannot be used. Instead, larger and more complex retrofocus designs are required.|$|R
