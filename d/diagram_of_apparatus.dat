40|$|Abstract—Encouraged {{by their}} {{previous}} research on telepathy, {{the authors of this}} article attempted to see if the discovered “telepathic wave ” (a radio wave of 46. 20 m) also has some involvement in precognitive phenomena. The experiments were performed with an original radio amplifier and were conducted in a similar manner to those experiments on telepathy (of course, with adequate modifications). We carry out two series (variants) of ESP cards tests. Very numerous control trials were also accomplished. The article is il-lustrated by a schematic <b>diagram</b> <b>of</b> <b>apparatus,</b> a three-dimensional graph and two numerical tables. The best score for precognition—not excessively high, {{as in the case of}} telepathy, but statistically significant (Chi-square test) —was noted at the same wavelength of 46. 20 m (amplification gain of 220 times; same as for telepathy), suggesting that the very complex intimate mechanism of both telepathy and precognition includes a coincident radio-component. The article also includes some remarks about a possible discordance between precognition and the theory of relativity...|$|E

40|$|Alcohol {{catalytic}} {{chemical vapor deposition}} (ACCVD) {{has become}} a popular CVD method for growth of high-purity single walled carbon nanotube (SWNT) films due to the low cost and easy handling of a non-hazardous CVD gas source [1]. Ethanol mainly decomposes into [2] ethylene and water at CVD temperatures. These thermally generated molecules could affect SWNT growth as is shown in ACCVD study [3]. We have investigated decomposed molecules behavior on the catalyst during ACCVD using Fourier Transfer infrared spectroscopy (FT-IR: Otsuka electronics IG- 1000). FT-IR cell was inserted between a reactor tube and a vacuum pump (Fig. 1). SWNT synthesis was performed using ethanol as a carbon source and Co/Mo bimetal as a catalyst. The behaviors of ethanol as a carbon source and ethylene, water, and carbon monoxide as the decomposed molecules on the catalyst have been reported by Shimazu et. al [4]. Water intensities show unusual behavior as is presented in Fig. 2. In the early stage of the reaction, water was generated by a catalytic reaction. After a few minutes, the behavior of water was changed from generation mode to consumption mode, which mode was continued during growth period. Finally, water was changed again to a generation mode. We analyzed this behavior using three reaction models. () Generation of water at low active catalysts, () Consumption of water by oxidation of amorphous carbons, and () Generation of water by thermal decomposition of EtOH {{on the surface of}} SWNTs. Adjusting parameters of each mode to experimental data, the behavior of water is calculated as shown in Fig. 2. Good agreement was achieved and this result indicates validity of our reaction models.

The device is operated in the polarization modulation and lock-in detection mode and provides the exact calculation of output signal shape and spectrum at any set of optical elements with any combination of linear and circular birefringence and dichroism. Variable parameters are not only polarization characteristics of a sample, but also those of optical elements set by an operator, as well as so important for precision measurements values as polarization modulation amplitude, static spurious birefringence in a piezooptical modulator, etc. Given the assumed response of different sample parameters to external effects, e. g. a magnetic field, one can predict the measurement results. On the other hand, while operating together with a real set-up, the model {{makes it possible to}} timely analyze the result obtained and possible artifacts.
