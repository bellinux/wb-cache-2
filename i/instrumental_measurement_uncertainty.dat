40|$|Packet jitter is a {{critical}} parameter to be accurately measured and monitored in communication and computer networks for quality-of-service assessment, particularly in Voice over Internet Protocol (VoIP) and real-time video applications. To this aim, suitable measurement systems, also known as “protocol analyzers,” are used. In particular, special-purposearchitecture-based protocol analyzer (SPAPA) and generalpurpose-architecture-based protocol analyzer (GPAPA) are the most widespread measurement solutions. In both cases, the measurement chain involves a reference data traffic generator and one or more nodes, suitably displaced at the measurement points {{of interest in the}} network. With special regard to the <b>instrumental</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of both SPAPAs and GPAPAs already present on the market, poor information is given by manufacturers. Moreover, the analysis in the literature concerning communication and computer network test and measurement clearly evidences the lack of important details on this key matter and, consequently, the need of further scientific investigation. This paper proposes a methodological approach to evaluate SPAPA and GPAPA instrumental uncertainty in packet jitter measurements. A general model accounting for the effect of the main quantities of influence is proposed, which allows quantifying the associated uncertainty components through a statistical analysis. A number of experiments on an actual GPAPA show the suitability and effectiveness of the proposal...|$|E
40|$|Measurement of Quality of Service (QoS) {{parameters}} is {{a relevant}} task in communication networks. Similarly to other contexts, the measurement result {{has to be}} completed with the related uncertainty {{in order to provide}} information about the signiﬁcance and reliabil- ity of the overall measurement process. This aspect is particularly crucial in communica- tion networks. In fact, the measured values of QoS parameters have often to be compared against suitable thresholds to check their compliance with required quality con- straints (QoS levels delivered to the user are generally offered for a fee) or to reliably verify the effect of new services conveyed by the network on its performance. Nevertheless, uncertainty estimation in QoS parameters measurement is still an open issue. Most literature concerning communication and computer networks test and mea- surement clearly evidences the lack of the advisable practice of uncertainty evaluation in QoS parameters measurement according to the guide for the expression of uncertainty in measurements (GUM). In addition, it is worth emphasizing that uncertainty modeling and evaluation in QoS parameters measurement are not trivial tasks because several aspects are involved in a QoS measurement process. All these aspects {{can be thought of as}} sources of measurement uncertainty, capable of signiﬁcantly inﬂuencing the reliability of measurement results. The paper investigates these issues by promoting and assessing the applicability of GUM tothespeciﬁc andcriticalcontextofcommunicationandcomputernetworkstestandmea- surement. More speciﬁcally, a simple model for uncertainty evaluation in Internet Protocol Packet Delay Variation measurement is proposed: a fundamental QoS parameter in Voice over IP and real time video streaming applications. The model is based on two main con- tributions: the former accounting for the <b>instrumental</b> <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and the latter for the measurand variability. A number of tests in a simulated scenario proves the effectiveness of the proposed model. To exemplify its practical application, some experiments in a real test-bed, i. e. the local area network of the University of Cassino and Southern Lazio, are ﬁnally conducted...|$|E
40|$|After reionization, {{emission}} in the 21 cm hyperfine transition {{provides a}} direct probe of neutral hydrogen distributed in galaxies. Different from galaxy redshift surveys, observation of baryon acoustic oscillations in the cumulative 21 cm emission may offer an attractive method for constraining dark energy properties at moderate redshifts. Keys {{to this program}} are techniques to extract the faint cosmological signal from various contaminants, such as detector noise and continuum foregrounds. In this paper, we investigate the possible systematic and statistical errors in the acoustic scale estimates using ground-based radio interferometers.

Therefore, it is crucial to assure that all technical assessors have an adequate level of knowledge about <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> and know how to proper assess it.

The guideline was implemented in Rede Metrológica RS (RMRS), a regional accreditation body from southern Brazil. Simultaneously to this <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> assessment guideline, it was also prepared a <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> check-list to help assessors conduct their laboratory assessments. As a result, an improvement on the level of knowledge about <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> was observed among RMRS assessors.

In order to fulfil the assessment of measurement results by taking the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> into account an approach was developed while consideration {{of the state of the}} art and legislative aspects. A comprehensive evaluation of collaborative trials on contaminants in soil was conducted to estimate the order of magnitude of the expected <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainties</b> in soil analysis.

When laser trackers are used on the shop floor, environment factors, especially non-uniform temperature can induce considerable <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty.</b> Aiming to reduce <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> of laser tracker, optimization of laser tracker configuration station for large-scale components in non-uniform temperature field using the Monte-Carlo method is proposed.

40|$|Abstract—Real-time systems usually {{incorporate}} {{a wide variety}} of challenges: A control engineer, for example, aims for the highest possible control quality achievable. Here, one key element is to minimise the <b>uncertainty</b> of the <b>measurements.</b> This, to put it simple, is the noise of sensor data, which has a negative effect on control. Although <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> is well treated in control theory, it is usually ignored in common real-time architectures where temporal properties are the prevalent criteria. Consequently, the communication between control engineers and real-time specialists is rather one way, revolving around deadlines and sampling periods. However, on closer examination, many real-time properties are derived from the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> aspired by the control engineer. Conversely, temporal variations, virtually inevitable in practice, can be represented as <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> as well. Tackling the <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> should therefore be an interdisciplinary task: The control system respects the actual run-time conditions instead of estimating them. Likewise, the real-time system considers <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> rather than blindly sticking to deadlines. In this paper we present an uncertainty-centric approach to leverage <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> in real-time architectures, not only at design time but also at run-time. Using <b>measurement</b> <b>uncertainty</b> as an explicit interface minimises the gap between real-time specialists and control engineers and facilitates a modular and flexible system design.
