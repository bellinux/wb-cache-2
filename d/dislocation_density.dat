25|$|There {{are several}} ways in which {{crystalline}} and amorphous materials can be engineered to increase their yield strength. By altering <b>dislocation</b> <b>density,</b> impurity levels, grain size (in crystalline materials), the yield strength of the material can be fine tuned. This occurs typically by introducing defects such as impurities dislocations in the material. To move this defect (plastically deforming or yielding the material), a larger stress must be applied. This thus causes a higher yield stress in the material. While many material properties depend only on {{the composition of the}} bulk material, yield strength is extremely sensitive to the materials processing as well.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the initial}} stage, or primary creep, or {{transient}} creep, the strain rate is relatively high, but decreases with increasing time and strain {{due to a}} process analogous to work hardening at lower temperatures.

Nanostructures and {{microhardness}} of {{a commercial}} purity Al, three binary Al–Mg alloys and a commercial AA 5182 alloy subjected to high pressure torsion (HPT) at room temperature were comparatively investigated using high-resolution transmission electron microscopy, X-ray diffraction (XRD) and high-resolution XRD line profile analysis. The hardness values of HPT samples are twice to three times larger {{than that of the}} undeformed counterparts. Grain sizes measured by XRD are in the range 10 – 200 nm with typical average values ranging from 46 to 120 nm.

However, at moderate <b>dislocation</b> <b>density</b> values of around 107-109 dislocations/m2, the material will exhibit a significantly lower mechanical strength.
