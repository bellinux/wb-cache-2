40|$|This thesis {{focuses on}} the seismic {{performance}} of unreinforced masonry wall perforated with a door opening representing typical URM walls of many aged masonry buildings in Indonesia. To obtain a test result that {{will be able to}} represent the local conditions, the experiments have been conducted in the Research Institute for Human Settlements (RIHS) laboratory in Bandung-Indonesia. Two 75 % unreinforced masonry (URM) walls with a 1 ½-wythe of solid clay-brick were constructed in <b>Dutch</b> <b>bond</b> configuration and tested until failure under quasi-static-reversed cyclic loading. Both units were loaded vertically by constant loads representing gravity loads on the URM wall’s tributary area. Both models were constructed using local materials and local labours. Two features were taken into account. First, it accommodated the influence of flanged wall and second, the URM wall was built on the stone foundation. The first URM wall represent the plain existing URM building in Indonesia and second strengthened by Kevlar fibre. It was observed from the test results that the URM wall Unit- 1 did not behave as a brittle structure. It could dissipate energy without loss of strength and had a post-elastic behaviour in terms of “overall displacement ductility” value of around 8 to 10. As predicted, the masonry material was variable and non homogeneous which caused the hysteresis loop to be non symmetrical between push and pull lateral load directions. It can be summarized that Kevlar fibre strengthening technique is promising and with great ease of installation. Although Kevlar material is more expensive when compared to other fabrics {{as long as it was}} applied at the essential locations and in limited volumes, it can significantly increase the in-plane URM wall capacity. With appropriate arrangements of Kevlar fibre, a practicing engineer will be able to obtain a desired rocking mechanism in the masonry structure. Another advantage for the architectural point of view, very thin Kevlar fibres do not reduce the architectural space. Studies have also been undertaken to analyze the in-plane response of plain URM wall before and after retrofiting using the current seismic standard and the Finite Element Method (FEM) ...|$|E

Unfortunately, {{the influence of the}} French on the economy was less benign.

5000|$|Dr Jameson’s {{programme}} {{was largely}} one of material development. In {{the words of}} the speech opening the 1905 session of parliament, [...] "without a considerable development of our agricultural and pastoral resources our position as a self-sustaining colony cannot be assured". This reliance on its own resources was the more necessary for the Cape because of the keen rivalry of Natal and Delagoa Bay for the carrying trade of the Transvaal. The opening up of backward districts by railways was vigorously pursued, and in other ways great efforts were made to assist agriculture. These efforts to help the country districts met with cordial recognition from the Dutch farmers, and the release, in May 1904, of all rebel prisoners was another step towards reconciliation. On the exclusion of Chinese from the colony the Bond party were also in agreement with the ministry. An education act passed in 1905 established school boards on a popular franchise and provided for the gradual introduction of compulsory education. The cultivation of friendly relations with the neighbouring colonies {{was also one of the}} leading objects of Dr Jameson’s policy. The Bond, on its side, sought to draw closer to Het Volk, the Boer organization in the Transvaal, and similar bodies, and at its 1906 congress, held in March that year at Ceres, a resolution with that aim was passed, the design being to unify, in accordance with the original conception of the <b>Bond,</b> <b>Dutch</b> sentiment and action throughout South Africa.|$|R
40|$|Though {{sovereign}} debts {{are often}} viewed as risk-free assets, some extreme events {{may lead to the}} repudiation of these debts. A large literature has been devoted to the motivations of repayment and to the causes of default. The impact of wars, which may lead to the repudiation of sovereign debt, on sovereign bond prices has also been analyzed. However, the impact of other types of seldom occurring but dramatic events, which may lead to the repudiation of debts, on bond prices has been overlooked. My current research aims to analyze three of them: the repudiation of debts because of their alleged "odiousness", the introduction of common debt after a state's unification and the debt partition following the break-up of a country. Since the events under consideration don't happen frequently, the dissertation will rely on four historical examples: Cuba, Russia, Italy and Belgium. The time period considered is the 19 th century. Based on a historical analysis and the set-up of an original database, this project determines the effects of these events on sovereign debt valorization, using an econometric approach. The first part of the research estimates the risk premium required by investors to hold debts which could be denounced as odious. Bondholders could require a premium to compensate for the higher default risk due to the odious character of the debts. The paper quantifies the risk premium required by investors to hold debts which could be denounced as odious and it analyses the relation between the value of the government bond and extreme "odious debt" events. In order to identify if such a premium exists, I focus on a Cuban case study. Based on an original database of Cuban bonds, the paper reveals the existence of a risk premium of at least 200 basis points which penalises bonds issued by dictatorial regimes. The bond market "odious" shocks are provided by a Structural VAR analysis. In a second case study, my research analyses the Tsarist bonds of 1906 and the premium to hold despotic regime debt. The paper shows that the market required a premium despite the attempts made by the Russian government to present the loan as clean. The second and third parts of my research look at the effects of state succession on the sovereign bonds market. They analyze respectively the two subsets of state succession: state unification and "country break-up". The second part of the dissertation provides an empirical study of sovereign debt integration and analyses the evolution of sovereign bond prices when several countries merge to become a "unified country" or when the probability of such an event exists. Based on an original database made of pre-unification and post-unification Italian bonds, the paper shows the impact of Italy's unification on the bonds. The analysis puts forward that prior to the unification in 1862, the bonds issued by the future parts of the kingdom reacted in an idiosyncratic way. Around the sovereign debt integration, the paper highlights a large risk increase for low-yield bonds. Using a break point analysis and a Dynamic Factor Model, the paper proves that until the late 1860 's the financial market did not believe in Italy's Unification. The third part of my research analyzes the financial impact on state bonds of a country which faces a risk to break up. This paper provides an empirical analysis of the evolution of sovereign debt prices when a state breaks up, or when it faces such an event. Based on an original database of <b>Dutch</b> and Belgian <b>bonds,</b> this research shows the impact of Belgian independence in 1830 on the Belgium bonds. This article analyses two risk premiums which may affect the sovereign debt of a state: the first one is linked to the country break-up (or the probability that one may occur) and the second one is due to the instability experienced by the new country. This analysis puts forward a "country break-up" risk premium of 142 basis points. The role of the debt underwriter has also been highlighted in the case of Belgian independence. Financial markets required no "new country" risk premium for Belgian bonds which were underwritten by Rothschild, but the risk premium remained for the Belgian authorities. This was likely due to the role of Rothschild as underwriter whose reputation persuaded the market that the risk is low, but who charged a premium to the Belgian government for their services.
