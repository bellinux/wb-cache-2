5|$|As {{with all}} titles on the Xbox 360, Halo 3 fully {{supports}} 5.1 surround sound audio. In the game, {{there are over}} 50,000 pieces of audio, with nearly 40,000 of those being NPC dialogue. This <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> in either of the preceding Halo titles; Halo 2 had over 15,000 pieces of dialogue. The AI controlling this dialogue is designed to ensure the exchanges flow naturally and convincingly. Separate recordings were made for nearby and distant gunfire to make for a more believable sound experience in the public beta, and the finished game uses Waves Audio plugins to modify dialog and other audio in-game depending on conditions. Distant gunfire sounds, which may first seem like prerecorded ambient sound, may often {{be the result of}} an actual firefight happening elsewhere in the game.|$|E

Approximately 40,000 of those troops died: more than half of disease, the remainder from battlefield wounds and from starvation. North Carolina also supplied about 15,000 Union troops.

IGN's Todd Gilchrist recognized Downey as [...] "the best thing" [...] in a film that [...] "functions on autopilot, providing requisite story developments and character details to fill in this default 'origin story' while the actors successfully breathe life into their otherwise conventional roles". Noting the cultural elements of the film, Cristobal Giraldez Catalan of Bright Lights Film Journal wrote, [...] "Iron Man <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> playboy fantasy; it is American foreign policy realized without context [...] with narrative and directorial precision, once again provides the high-fidelity misogyny and anti-Muslim rhetoric Hollywood is known for." ...|$|E
500|$|Barbauld's Lessons for Children and Hymns in Prose for Children were a {{revolution}} in children's literature. For the first time, {{the needs of the}} child reader were seriously considered. Barbauld demanded that her books be printed in large type with wide margins so that children could easily read them and, even more important, she developed a style of [...] "informal dialogue between parent and child" [...] that would dominate children's literature for a generation. In Lessons for Children, a four-volume, age-adapted reading primer, Barbauld employs the concept of a mother teaching her son. More than likely, many of the events in these stories were inspired by Barbauld's experience of teaching her own son, Charles. This series <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a way to acquire literacy—it also introduces the reader to [...] "elements of society's symbol-systems and conceptual structures, inculcates an ethics, and encourages him to develop a certain kind of sensibility." [...] Moreover, it exposes the child to the principles of [...] "botany, zoology, numbers, change of state in chemistry ... the money system, the calendar, geography, meteorology, agriculture, political economy, geology, [...] astronomy." [...] The series was relatively popular and Maria Edgeworth commented in the educational treatise that she co-authored with her father, Practical Education (1798), that it is [...] "one of the best books for young people from seven to ten years old, that has yet appeared." ...|$|E

For three-hundred years, women have been taught needlework through practice and tradition, and in inadvertently, promoted obedience and household effeminate behavior.

[...] W. E. K. Anderson added the other side of the coin: [...] "It is candid about Scott himself. [...] It is neither informative nor candid about other people." [...] The novelist and critic A. N.

[...] It <b>is</b> <b>far</b> <b>more</b> <b>than</b> a work of art.
