The common pattern of the percentage <b>harmonic</b> <b>factor,</b> for the converter characteristic harmonic current, per incremental change of the thyristor firing angle is used as the basis of the study. The RMS values of the peak amplitudes of the characteristic harmonic currents induced in the input-phase of the converter supplying a DC motor are described in terms of the sampling theorem equations and further evaluated in terms of their respective individual harmonic contributions as the thyristor firing angle is changed. The MatLab/Simulink package is also employed to simulate the forward drive speed control operation of a DC motor using the 6 -pulse AC-DC thyristor converter. However the percentage <b>harmonic</b> <b>factor</b> trends observed in the sampling theorem method appear to be generally increasing which is in contradiction to the MatLab/Simulink produced trends...|$|E
40|$|Laser seeding {{technique}} {{have been}} envisioned to produce nearly transform-limited pulses at soft X-ray FELs. Echo-Enabled Harmonic Generation (EEHG) is a promising, recent technique for harmonic generation with an excellent up-conversion to very high harmonics, {{from the standpoint}} of electron beam physics. This paper explores the constraints on seed laser performance for reaching wavelengths of 1 nm. We show that the main challenge in implementing the EEHG scheme at extreme harmonic factors is the requirement for accurate control of temporal and spatial quality of the seed laser pulse. For example, if the phase of the laser pulse is chirped before conversion to an UV seed pulse, the chirp in the electron beam microbunch turns out to be roughly multiplied by the <b>harmonic</b> <b>factor.</b> In the case of a Ti:Sa seed laser, such factor is about 800. For such large harmonic numbers, generation of nearly transform-limited soft X-ray pulses results in challenging constraints on the Ti:Sa laser. In fact, the relative discrepancy of the time-bandwidth product of the seed-laser pulse from the ideal transform-limited performance should be no more than one in a million. The generated electron beam microbunching is also very sensitive to distortions of the seed laser wavefront, which are also multiplied by the <b>harmonic</b> <b>factor.</b> In order to have minimal reduction of the FEL input coupling factor, it is desirable that the size-angular bandwidth product of the UV seed laser beam be very close to the ideal i. e. diffraction-limited performance in the waist plane at the middle of the modulator undulator.

In this study, {{we consider}} the geometric aspects of low earth orbit (LEO) satellite constellations and investigate {{the performance of a}} satellite network that uses our proposed routing algorithm. The optimum inclination and <b>harmonic</b> <b>factor</b> of rosette constellations are obtained by considering the minimum coverage radius of a satellite. Actual altitude is determined by this radius and the specified elevation angle. The algorithm uses the uniformity of the geometric structure to form a continuously connected group of nodes in the network which renders global intersatellite connectivity information insignificant. Each group, consisting of a node and its four neighbours, does not change with time and a stationary network structure is obtained by allowing each node to communicate only with its neighbours. Queuing analysis of the network is made for both packet and voice traffic. Simulation results are then compared to analytical results derived from uniform ciricl equal traffic distribution. The proposed algorithm is simulated in a scenario in which sources, destinations, and gateways on the earth form the global traffic.

40|$|This {{document}} contains three sections. The {{first two}} present new methods for two-sample testing {{where there are}} many variables of interest and the third presents a new methodology for time series bootstrapping. In the first section we develop a test statistic for testing the equality of two population mean vectors in the "large-p-small-n" setting. Such a test must surmount the rank-deficiency of the sample covariance matrix, which breaks down the classic Hotelling T^(2) test. The proposed procedure, called the generalized component test, avoids full estimation of the covariance matrix by assuming that the p components admit a logical ordering such that the dependence between components is related to their displacement. The test is shown to be competitive with other recently developed methods under ARMA and long-range dependence structures and to achieve superior power for heavy-tailed data. The test does not assume equality of covariance matrices between the two populations, is robust to heteroscedasticity in the component variances, and requires very little computation time, which allows its use in settings with very large p. An analysis of mitochondrial calcium concentration in mouse cardiac muscles over time and of copy number variations in a glioblastoma multiforme data set from The Cancer Genome Atlas are carried out to illustrate the test. In the second section we present a theorem establishing a power improvement to the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure for controlling the false discovery rate when it is applied to test statistics which have been adjusted {{for the effects of}} latent factors. We extend recently published methodology to the context of serially dependent test statistics by presenting a frequency-domain adaptation of their procedure. We show that our <b>harmonic</b> <b>factor</b> adjustment to the test statistics improves the power of the Benjamini-Hochberg procedure without compromising its control of the false discovery rate when the test statistics are affected by latent periodic components. An illustration of our methodology is given in an analysis of copy number variations, which are measured along a chromosome and tend to exhibit serial dependence; power gains from our <b>harmonic</b> <b>factor</b> adjustment are demonstrated. In the third section we present a smoothed bootstrap procedure for time series data. Unlike with independent data, smoothed boostraps have received little consideration for time series. However, as evidenced in the iid smooth bootstrap, additional data smoothing steps within resampling can improve bootstrap approximations of the distributions of statistics, especially when such sampling distributions depend critically on unknown and smooth (e. g., infinite-dimensional) population quantities, such as marginal densities. To broaden the effectiveness of the bootstrap for time series, we propose a smooth bootstrap based on modifying a state-of-the-art block resampling approach for dependent data based on tapering windows. The resulting smooth (extended) tapered block bootstrap (TBB) is shown to provide valid variance and distributional approximations over a broad class of parameters and statistics for stationary time series, formulated in terms of statistical functionals (e. g., smooth function model statistics, L- and M-estimators, rank statistics). Our treatment goes beyond statistics as smooth functions of sample averages, showing that the smooth TBB has applicability in inference cases which have not been formally established for other TBB versions. Some finite-sample simulations also provide evidence that smoothing steps enhance the performance of the block bootstrap for various statistical functionals...|$|E

The power line measurements were made using an ABB Power+ recorder and analyzer during a whole day. The quantities recorded have been the frequency, the total rms values of the voltage and current, the current and voltage <b>harmonic</b> distortion <b>factors</b> and the first fifteen current and voltage harmonics. The analysis of data shows that the <b>harmonic</b> distortion <b>factor</b> of the voltage is always less than IEEE 519 recommended limit thanks of high power of the transformer comparatively with the power of the load. In order to keep the current distortion within allowed limits, the proposed filter installation must lead to a significant diminution of 3 rd and 5 th harmonics and a less significant diminution of the superior order harmonics. In this concrete application, the proposed solution for harmonics mitigation is based on passive power filtering.
