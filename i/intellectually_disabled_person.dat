40|$|The present thesis {{examines}} {{legal issues}} relating to human rights and intellectual disability within the wider context of liberal theory. The claim of the thesis is that a legal framework can be developed which both adequately protects {{the human rights of}} <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons,</b> as well as grants these persons equality and more freedom of choice, in accordance to the rights increasingly recognised to <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons.</b> The interpretive principle which supports the application of this framework is human dignity. Human dignity is understood, within this thesis, as respecting the critical interests of <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons,</b> based on the theory of ethical individualism which Ronald Dworkin advances in his book “Sovereign Virtue”. Respecting the critical interest of <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons,</b> and thereby their dignity, means two basis things, according to this thesis: first, upholding their autonomy. Guardianship and other legal frameworks of decision-making by proxy uphold the autonomy of <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons,</b> by appointing an autonomous person to look after the affairs of the <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled.</b> The missing autonomy of the <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> is exercised by proxy. Second: fostering their autonomy. <b>Intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> require more help and support to succeed in their lives and that support has to be provided by the social and political community, commensurate with the needs and developmental possibilities of the person, as well as budgetary constraints.

5000|$|Furthermore, {{many with}} disabilities, {{intellectual}} and (or) psychical, finding a stable workforce poses many challenges. According {{to a study}} conducted by JARED (Journal of Applied Research and Intellectual Disability, indicates that although finding a job may be difficult for an intellectually disabled individual, stabilizing a job is even harder. This is largely due to two main factors: production skills and effective social skills. This idea is supported by Chadsey-Rusch who claims that securing employment for the intellectually disabled, requires adequate production skills and effective social skills. However, other underlying factors for job loss include, structural factors and the integration between worker and workplace. As stated by Kilsby, limited structural factors can effect a multitude of factors in a job. Factors such as a restricted amount of hours an <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> is allowed to work. This in return according to Fabian, Wistow, and Schneider leads to a lack of opportunity to develop relationships with coworkers and a chance to better integrate within the workplace. Nevertheless, those who are unable to stabilize a job often are left discouraged. According to the same study conducted by JARED, many who had participated, found that they had made smaller incomes when compared to their co-workers, had an excess of time throughout their days, because they did not have work. They also, had feelings of hopelessness and failure. According to the NOD ( [...] National Organization On Disability), not only do the (ID) face constant discouragement but many live below the poverty line, because they are unable to find or stabilize employment and (or) because of employee restricting factors placed on ID workers. This then causes the (ID) the incapacity to provide for themselves basic necessities one needs. Items such as, food, medical care, transportation, and housing.|$|E

40|$|The {{focus of}} this paper is {{on the use of the}} concept of sexual {{exploitation}} in legislation concerning sexual expression by persons with mental impairment, with particular emphasis on persons with intellectual disability. Two main statutory approaches have been adopted in Australian jurisdictions. The first is prohibition of sexual acts between a person with intellectual disability and others who, by virtue of their employment, are in a position of ascendancy over that person. The second is the prohibition of sexually exploitative acts by any person towards a person with an intellectual disability. The major aim in this article is to critically examine these approaches and evaluate them according to the standards of being non-discriminatory, minimally restrictive of rights, and enforceable. It is argued that comprehensively cataloguing sexually exploitative acts is untenable, with the result that prohibition of all sexual exploitation is unenforceable. The alternative, namely legislation that prohibits sexual relations with any person employed to render any kind of service to the <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person,</b> would further restrict an already limited number of potential sexual partners. We suggest that a more useful approach would be to prohibit sexual activity in one-on-one relationships whose scope is commonly understood to exclude such acts, while allowing relations between workers or caregivers and the persons to whom they do not directly render services. This mechanism would have to be narrowly defined to have the desired effect of affording protection to vulnerable persons while preserving their right to sexual expression...|$|E

A survey among members of the Netherlands Society of Physicians for Persons with Intellectual Disabilities (NVAVG) has been performed to identify the incidence and nature of the complications in <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> in the Netherlands.

In addition, in the last five years 13 physicians had observed deaths that were most likely related to gastrostomy. Due to the design of the study, the low response to the questionnaire and the lack of information on the total number of <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> with a gastrostomy, it was not possible to calculate the percentage of persons who experienced a complication.

ISBN: 91 - 888 14 51 - 3 ISSN 1401 - 5781 The basic issue in this dissertation is the municipalization of the special school and care services. The main objective is to describe and analyse the consequences this local authority take-over has had on the <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> and their living conditions. Through modified levels of living studies light is shed upon the changes in living conditions for <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> children, adolescents and adults in the county of Halland. In comparison with the rest of the population, <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> had worse living conditions in all areas when the municipalization was carried through in 1991 and these conditions had only changed marginally up till 1995. In the dissertation, levels of living studies are discussed as a way of defining and measuring the disability ideological principle known as normalization. Since <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> have not obtained equal living conditions with the rest of the population, normalization has not been reached. During the work with the study on the consequences of municipalization, it was observed that the number of pupils in special schools had increased considerably. This lead to a qualitative interview study with 20 parents to children registered as so-called individually integrated pupils on their experiences of the special school registration. From the experiences of these parents an analysis is made of the expansion of the special school as a sign of increased social categorization of pupils with difficulties at school mainly due to lacking resources in comprehensive school. Simultaneously with the reduction of resources in school a boom has taken place for biological and individual explanations to children's school-related difficulties, which strengthens the categorization process. The increased registration into special school may be seen as a disability-creating process with consequences both to individuals and to school in general...|$|R
40|$|So far, the {{majority}} of both research and social policies regarding education of individuals with intellectual disabilities focused on children and adolescents, who were targets of numerous programs meant to adjust both learning materials and methods of teaching to their needs. At the same time, the issue of continuing education for adults with intellectual disabilities has been marginalised or even completely ignored. This was partially {{due to the fact}} that these people, no longer being subject to mandatory education, remained outside of the educational system and thus tended to be overlooked, which meant that there were few – if any – educational opportunities available to them. Another issue to consider was the very low level of awareness in the society regarding the need to activate this group of people both socially and occupationally. This situation has changed considerably during the last 25 years and still continues to change. There are far more opportunities for adults with learning disability to actively participate in specially designed activities. There is also a fundamental shift in the perspective on the role of such activities, from programs meant to fill the disabled person’s time to more structured educational programs aimed at promoting independent functioning and integration with the society, as well as acquisition of skills which would allow them to undertake meaningful work within supported work environment. These programs also aim to act against prejudice and discrimination and to shift the view of an <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>person</b> from an “eternal child ” to an adult with concrete skills and abilities.

Discourses of representation and of educational practice were identified through statistical and interpretive analysis, following the discourse analysis school of Q-methodology. The findings of this study reveal the operation of power in a medico-psychological gaze that makes ID visible and supervises disability expertise within education. Representations of ID suffused with religious notions support the exercise of pastoral power by disability experts. Human rights discourses in education can marginalise ID people if applied uncritically. Fixed notions of impairment constrain an intellectually disabled subject who is vulnerable and incompetent. This study argues instead for a theory of (poss) ability, underpinned by an understanding of the situational and shared nature of competence and a fluid conception of impairment. Human rights should be supplemented by an ethics of care and belonging in the community (ubuntu). A research agenda supporting this effort would examine the ways in which ID people work on themselves as subjects (subjectivisation) and explore the potential for resistance in this process...|$|E

Os elementos foram identificados das experiências cotidianas de seis famílias, cadauma com um membroportador de deficiência mental na idade adulta, levantando dados sobre: a construção do conceito de deficiência mental; as formas de agir e de reagir do portador de deficiência e dos demais membros do grupo {{familiar}}; a construção das relações familiares; e a compreensão da condição de adulto no portador de deficiência mental. Entendendo a interação entre os diferentes membros do grupo familiar, como um fator determinante na construção das relações da pessoa portadora de deficiência mental, considera-se necessário compreender a forma destes membros lidarem e se relacionarem, durante vinte ou mais anos com esta pessoa. Para tanto, foram entrevistadas mães, pais e irmãos(as), num total de 18 pessoas (seis grupos familiares), cujos filhos e filhas participaram de um programa de adaptação fisica para portadores de deficiência mental na idade adulta, na FEF-UNICAMP. Abordamos nosso objeto de conhecimento, utilizando para a coleta de informações a entrevista semi-estruturada, realizada durante visitas de observação do cotidiano, no próprio lar de cada entrevistado. Uma vez transcritas as entrevistas, estas foram apresentadas para serem discutidas, corrigidas, completadas por cada pessoa entrevistada. Encontrou-se que: a construção do conceito de deficiência mental depende mais da própria convivência do grupo que de concepções externas; as relações entre os diferentes membros do grupo familiar e a pessoa portadora de deficiência mental são marcadas por uma infinidade de sentimentos positivos ou negativos, gerados, na maioria das vezes, pelos comportamentos do portador de deficiência; o grupo familiar, como intermediário do social, determina e conduz a entrada da pessoa portadora de deficiência na sociedade de acordo com padrões sociais aceitos. Esta tese poderá contribuir para: problematizar o conceito de deficiência; questionar a visão de que a pessoa portadora de deficiência mental é uma eterna criança; esclarecer que o seu desenvolvimento como ser adulto tem a ver sobretudo com aspectos da sua sexualidade, independência e produtividade; evidenciar que as pessoas deste grupo familiar, antes de ser cobradas, precisam ser atendidas, tanto quanto a pessoa portadora de deficiência mental, nas suas dificuldades, dúvidas e acertos, tornando-as aliadas na conquista de uma melhor qualidade de vida para todos os envolvidos na questão da deficiência mental; fornecer pistas para outras pesquisas e para a criação de programas de atendimento às famílias de pessoas portadoras de deficiência mental; assim como contribuir para a formação do profissional que atua junto ao portador de deficiência mental.;;Abstract:This research {{raises some}} issues {{that allow us}} to find resources to help the professional who works with mental deficiency, and to improve the assistance to these families. These issues were identified during the daily lives of 6 families. Each one of them had an adult with intellectual disabilities. Data was gathered about the following: the construction of the concept of intellectual disability, the ways the intellectually disabled adult and the members of his family group act/react; the construction of family relationships; the understanding of the condition of the intellectually able adult. The interaction between the different members ofthe family group is a factor which determines the construction of the relations of the intellectually disabled adultoIt is therefore necessary to understand {{the ways in which the}} members of the family have coped with this particular situation, and have related to the disabled adult during twenty or more years. Mothers, fathers, brothers and sisters were interviewed, a total of 18 people (6 family groups) whose daughters and sons have taken part in a physical adjustment programme for adults at the FEF-UNICAMP. We approached our object of knowledge using the following strategy to collect information: the semi-structured interview, carried out during visits to the homes, during which the everyday activities were observed. Once the interviews were transcribed, they were presented to the interviewees in order to be discussed, corrected, and completed by each person. It was found that the construction of the concept of intellectual disability depends more on the own experience ofliving inside the family group the relations between the different members ofthe family. And the intellectually disabled adult are characterized by multiple positive or negative feelings, which are often generated by the behavior of the inteIlectually handicapped himself; the family group as an intermediary instance between society and the disabled adult determines and conducts hislher access to society, according to accepted social standards. This thesis will contribute to the foIlowing: problematize the concept of intellectual disability; questioning the image that the intellectually disables person is an eternal child; making it clear that his/her development as an adult has to do mainly with aspects of his/her sexuality, independence and productivity; making it visible that the members of the family group need assistance instead of criticism they may have difficulties, doubts, or achievements, but they can be helped to become allies in the accomplishment of a better quality of life for every one involved in the problem of inteIlectual disability; developing further research, and creating programmes to assist the families of intellectually disabled people.

Consequently, it is important that nurses develop or maintain positive attitudes towards people with disabilities during their education. However, more knowledge is needed about current attitudes of nursing students and factors influencing these attitudes. - Methods: A sample of Dutch nursing students (n = 81) and an age-matched group of non-nursing peers (n = 48) completed standardized scales measuring attitudes about physically or <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> people. Data were collected in 2006. - Findings: Nursing students were more positive towards physically disabled people than their peers, and more strongly endorsed empowerment and similarity of <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> people. These attitudinal differences generally remained statistically significant after multivariate adjustment for demographic variables and experience and contact with individuals with disabilities. An important independent determinant of a positive attitude towards physically disabled people in the total sample was having a relative or friend with a physical disability. This association, however, was not apparent in attitudes towards <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons.</b> - Conclusion: Educational interventions aimed at improving attitudes towards people with disabilities should include focus on forms of contact beyond the context of formal care relationships...|$|R

40|$|The Event Segmentation Theory (Kurby & Zacks, 2008; Zacks, Speer, Swallow, Braver, & Reynolds, 2007) {{explains}} the perceptual organization {{of an ongoing}} activity into meaningful events. The classical event segmentation task (Newtson, 1973) involves watching an online video and indicating with key presses the event boundaries, i. e., when one event ends {{and the next one}} begins. The resulting hierarchical organization of object-based coarse events and action-based fine events gives insight into various cognitive processes. I used the Event Segmentation Theory to develop assistance and training systems for assembly workers in industrial settings at various levels - experts, new hires, and <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> people. Therefore, the first scientific question I asked was whether online and offline event segmentation result in the same event boundaries. This is important because assembly work requires not only watching activities online but processing the information offline, e. g., while performing the assembly task. By developing a special software tool that enables assessment of offline event boundaries, I established that online perception and offline elaboration lead to similar event boundaries. This study supports prior work suggesting that instructions should be structured around event boundaries. Secondly, I investigated the importance of fine versus coarse event boundaries when learning the sequence of steps in virtual training, both for novices and experts in car door assembly. I found memory, tested by ability to predict the next frame, to be enhanced for object-based coarse events from the nearest fine event boundary. However, virtual training did not improve memory for action-based fine events from the nearest coarse event boundary. I conjecture that trainees primarily acquire the sequence of object-based coarse events in an initial training. Based on differences found in memory performance between experts and novices, I conclude that memory for action-based fine events is dependent on expertise. Thirdly, I used the Event Segmentation Theory to investigate whether the simple and repetitive assembly tasks offered at workshops for <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> utilize their full cognitive potential. I analyzed event segmentation performance of 32 <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> compared to 30 controls using a variety of event segmentation measures. I found specific deficits in event boundary detection and hierarchical organization of events for the <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> group. However, results suggest that hierarchical organization is task-dependent. Because the event segmentation task accounted for differences in general cognitive ability, I propose the event segmentation task as diagnostic method for the need for support in executing assembly tasks. Based on these three studies, I argue that the Event Segmentation Theory offers a framework for assessment and assistance of important attentional, perceptual, and memory processes related to assembly tasks. I demonstrate how practical applications can make use of this framework for the development of new computer-based assistance and training systems that are tailored to the users’ need for support and improve their quality of life...|$|R

Research on attitudes and stereotypes toward these people still focuses on explicit measures subjected to social-desirability biases, and neglects how variability in facial stigmata influences attitudes and stereotyping. Methodology/Principal FindingsThe participants were 165 adults including 55 young adult students, 55 non-student adults, and 55 professional caregivers working with <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons.</b> They were faced with implicit association tests (IAT), a well-known technique whereby response latency is used to capture the relative strength with which some groups of people—here photographed faces of typically developing children and children with T 21 —are automatically (without conscious awareness) associated with positive versus negative attributes in memory. Each participant also rated the same photographed faces (consciously accessible evaluations). We provide the first evidence that the positive bias typically found in explicit judgments of children with T 21 is smaller for those whose facial features are highly characteristic of this disorder, compared to their counterparts with less distinctive features and to typically developing children. We also show that this bias can coexist with negative evaluations at the implicit level (with large effect sizes), even among professional caregivers. ConclusionThese findings support recent models of feature-based stereotyping, and more importantly show how crucial it is to go beyond explicit evaluations to estimate the true extent of stigmatization of <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> people...|$|R

40|$|PURPOSE: To {{estimate}} {{the magnitude and}} causes of blindness and low vision in The Netherlands from 2000 to 2020. METHODS: Recent population-based blindness surveys in established market economies were reviewed. Age and gender specific prevalence and causes of blindness and low vision were extracted and calculated for six population subgroups in The Netherlands. A mathematical model was developed to relate the epidemiologic data with demographic data for each subgroup for each year between 2000 and 2020. RESULTS: In 2008 an estimated 311, 000 people are visually impaired in The Netherlands: 77, 000 are blind and 234, 000 have low vision. With the current intervention the number may increase by 18 % to 367, 000 in 2020. Visual impairment is most prevalent among residents of nursing homes and care institutions for the elderly, <b>intellectually</b> <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> and people aged 50 + living independently. Of all people with visual impairment 31 % is male (97, 000) and 69 % female (214, 000). More {{than half of all}} visual impairment (56 %; 174, 000 persons) is avoidable. A variation of around 20 % might be applied to the numbers in these estimates. CONCLUSIONS: The aim of VISION 2020 : The Right to Sight to reduce avoidable visual impairment is also relevant for developed countries like The Netherlands. Vision screening and awareness campaigns focusing on the identified risk groups can reduce avoidable blindness considerably. Regular updates of the model will ensure that the prognoses remain valid and relevant. With appropriate demographic data, the model can also be used in other established market economies...|$|R
40|$|This {{paper is}} based on a {{consumer}} study of twenty-four <b>intellectually</b> and physically <b>disabled</b> <b>persons</b> and eighteen parents of <b>intellectually</b> and physically <b>disabled</b> dependents using a range of nongovernment welfare organizations in South-East Queensland (Brown & Ringma, 1988). The consumer study is part of a policy and service delivery study. This paper will summarize the perspectives of consumers and parents of dependent consumers on the accessibility of information on services; the exercise of consumer choice in service provision; access issues; quality of service provision; inadequacies in the service delivery system; and consumer participation in decision making regarding service delivery. The paper provides some analysis of the problems in these key areas, arguing in particular that consumer perspectives on service delivery are significantly influenced by the fact that consumers operate within a narrow field of service options. The paper concludes by drawing a comparison between these consumer perspectives and the hoped for service-delivery rationale in the new Disability Services Act, 1986...|$|R
