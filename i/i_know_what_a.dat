6000|$|... "Only three-eighths, Spud," [...] {{answered}} the fun-loving Rover, gaily. [...] "You see <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> awful appetite you had, and as I had an extra twenty-five cent piece in my jeans I thought I'd try to satisfy that appetite just once." ...|$|R

6000|$|And primarily, {{from this}} sculpture, {{you are to}} learn what a [...] "Master" [...] is. Here was one man at least, who knew his business, once upon a time!

6000|$|... "It's painful, but I must go on. <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> mistake <b>I</b> {{had made}} {{as soon as}} I saw Olcott come in; but you don't {{understand}} yet how far my suspicions led me. I felt it my duty to see Judson about Mrs. Olcott's lease." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh, don't think that! <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> effort {{it was to}} you {{to answer}} me at all. Yes, indeed! I wonder whether I may ask something. The sorrow you have just told me of {{is not the only}} one--is it? You have had other troubles?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "No, I'm all right. Perhaps {{a fellow}} {{has to stop}} eating {{in order to see}} things. At any rate, I have seen things I never dreamed were in the world. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> woman is,--now." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Heavens!" [...] Graham sighed with relief; {{for he had}} {{startled and}} {{clutched}} Paula's arm. [...] "That's the time I got my fright. The little maiden is avenged. Also, at last, <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> lead-pipe cinch is." ...|$|E

60|$|Well, do you <b>know</b> when <b>I</b> {{saw that}} I {{began to feel}} sorry--sorry--sorry. It {{seemed to me that}} I had done wrong. I {{reflected}} deeply.

5000|$|... â€¦ Don't get me wrong: I'm {{very proud}} of that pub, and <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>an</b> honor it is.

6000|$|... "It's too bad, old man; but we can't help ourselves. You'll {{be sorry}} {{not to see}} Gladys when you wake; but you won't feel half so bad as I shall, 'cause <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> slim chance there is of our ever strikin' another place like this." ...|$|E

[...] "That {{was before}} I {{undertook}} this extra work, or before <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> grind {{it was going to}} be. Equity is a good deal of a dose for me, any way.

6000|$|... 'Well, good-bye, and lie still. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>a</b> {{drowning}} is, {{and more}} than one.

6000|$|... "Well, {{what did}} I say? Hold your jaw, will you, {{and not be}} halloaing at me that way? <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>what</b> I'm <b>a</b> saying of, and <b>what</b> I'm <b>a</b> doing of." ...|$|R
