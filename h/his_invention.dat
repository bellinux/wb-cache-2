5|$|The airship had tumultuous {{times at}} the start. Professor A. W. Bernard of Nashville, Tennessee took claim to <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> in 1897. Myers sent telegrams to editors of {{newspapers}} {{in the month of}} May of that year explaining that he was the inventor of the world's first 'sky-cycle' airship in spite of what Bernard and others said. Myers explained to the newspapers that <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> had already been displayed in front of a group of people in New York City in August 1895. Myers showed to them that the basic principles of the controllable airship were already patented by him and his wife on May 26, 1885. He further explained that the only 'sky-cycle' patent ever issued to anybody was granted to him on April 20, 1897. Bernard was trying to stake claim that it was <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> and had really just made a duplicate of Myers' previous recorded patents.|$|E

5|$|The Boultons had two {{children}}, Matthew Robinson Boulton and Anne Boulton. Matthew Robinson in turn had {{six children}} with two wives. His eldest son Matthew Piers Watt Boulton, broadly educated {{and also a}} man of science, gained some fame posthumously for <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> of the important aeronautical flight control, the aileron. As his father before him, he also had two wives and six children.|$|E
5|$|By {{the age of}} 22, Evans {{moved out}} of wheel-making and became a {{specialist}} in forming the fine wire used in textile cards, which were used to comb fibers {{in preparation for the}} spinning process to make thread or yarn. A desire to increase the efficiency of this process led him to his first invention—a machine which would bend wire into teeth and cut them off rapidly to aid the assembly of cards. George Latimer, then a justice of the peace in Newport, saw its potential and tasked a blacksmith with creating the machine, which became one of Evans's early successes when it was introduced in 1778. Evans wished to go further in mechanizing the production of textile cards by developing a machine which could puncture the leather into which the wire teeth were inserted. <b>His</b> <b>invention</b> greatly speeded the card manufacturing process, producing around 1,500 teeth every minute, though Evans himself was unable to find financial backing to commercialize <b>his</b> <b>invention.</b> Nevertheless, {{over the next two decades}} card manufacturing innovations inspired by Evans's led to the development of automated textile card production, then in great demand due to the growth of the Southern cotton industry. Early pioneers of mechanized textile-card production, including Giles Richards and Amos Whittemore, are thought to have borrowed heavily from his original designs.|$|E

5|$|In September 1894, C. T. R. Wilson was {{employed}} at the observatory {{for a couple}} of weeks as temporary relief for one of the permanent staff. During this period, he witnessed a Brocken spectre and glory, caused by the sun casting a shadow on a cloud below the observer. He subsequently tried to reproduce these phenomena in the laboratory, resulting in <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> of the cloud chamber, used to detect ionising radiation.|$|E
5|$|A 1951 letter {{showed that}} Bradner clearly {{understood}} that the insulation in such a suit was not provided by the water between the suit and the skin, but rather that this layer of water next to the skin, if trapped, would quickly heat to skin temperature, if the material in the suit were insulative. Thus, the suit only needed to limit purging by fresh cold water, {{and it did not}} need to be dry to work. He applied for a U.S. patent for the wetsuit, but his patent application was turned down due to its similar design with the flight suit. The United States Navy also did not adopt the new wetsuits because of worries that the neoprene in the wetsuits might make its swimmers easier to spot by underwater sonar and, thus, could not exclusively profit from <b>his</b> <b>invention.</b>|$|E
5|$|After {{escaping}} from custody, Roger uses Billy {{to communicate and}} send scripts to Penny. When rewriting one of the programs, Gork: Son of Fire, Roger attempts to write the script with self-referential events, proving to everyone that the mysterious killer is actually sound engineer Max Applewhite. Max explains that his killings were a revenge scheme that dealt with stock holders and patents, specifically detailing <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> of television, which other scientists have copied. Roger and Penny are taken by Max atop the radio tower at gunpoint. Max is eventually killed when a biplane shows up and guns him down. Impressed by the nightly performance, the sponsors decide to fund WBN. Roger and Penny reconcile their complex relationship and decide not to divorce.|$|E

5|$|David Hillis, one of DeLee's {{colleagues at}} the Chicago Lying-in Hospital, {{published}} a 1917 journal article about <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> of the fetoscope, {{also known as the}} head stethoscope. By 1922, DeLee published a report of a similar device. Though DeLee published his findings several years after Hillis, he claimed that he had been openly discussing his idea for the device over many years. The device became known as the DeLee-Hillis stethoscope. DeLee was also the inventor of a catheter used to suction an infant's airway; the DeLee suction trap is still used after the delivery of a baby. He was one of the earliest physicians to advocate for the lower segment cesarean section.|$|E
5|$|Hydrogen was {{liquefied}} for {{the first}} time by James Dewar in 1898 by using regenerative cooling and <b>his</b> <b>invention,</b> the vacuum flask. He produced solid hydrogen the next year. Deuterium was discovered in December 1931 by Harold Urey, and tritium was prepared in 1934 by Ernest Rutherford, Mark Oliphant, and Paul Harteck. Heavy water, which consists of deuterium in the place of regular hydrogen, was discovered by Urey's group in 1932. François Isaac de Rivaz built the first de Rivaz engine, an internal combustion engine powered by a mixture of hydrogen and oxygen in 1806. Edward Daniel Clarke invented the hydrogen gas blowpipe in 1819. The Döbereiner's lamp and limelight were invented in 1823.|$|E
5|$|Ion I. Agârbiceanu (1907–1971) was {{the author}} of {{pioneering}} work in spectroscopy, famed for <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> of a gas laser. Another one of the writers' sons was a surveyor. He and his family remained in possession of Agârbiceanu's large villa in Cluj, which was later declared a historic monument. The writer's grave was awarded the same status by Romania's Culture Ministry in 2012. Among the localities associated with Agârbiceanu's work, Bucium is home to a Fefeleaga Memorial House, a modern reconstruction which used Romanian folk houses as a blueprint; Sofia Danciu's actual home burned down in summer 2014.|$|E

5|$|Lord Kelvin {{invented the}} heat pump in 1852, and Heinrich Zoelly had {{patented}} {{the idea of}} using it to draw heat from the ground in 1912. But {{it was not until the}} late 1940s that the geothermal heat pump was successfully implemented. The earliest one was probably Robert C. Webber's home-made 2.2kW direct-exchange system, but sources disagree as to the exact timeline of <b>his</b> <b>invention.</b> J. Donald Kroeker designed the first commercial geothermal heat pump to heat the Commonwealth Building (Portland, Oregon) and demonstrated it in 1946. Professor Carl Nielsen of Ohio State University built the first residential open loop version in his home in 1948. The technology became popular in Sweden as a result of the 1973 oil crisis, and has been growing slowly in worldwide acceptance since then. The 1979 development of polybutylene pipe greatly augmented the heat pump’s economic viability.|$|E
5|$|The John Deere House and Shop is {{historically}} significant for its {{influence in the}} areas of commerce, agriculture, industry, and invention. The site was designated a U.S. National Historic Landmark on July 19, 1964. The Landmark designation was assigned by the U.S. Department of Interior because of the House and Shop's association with John Deere, founder of the John Deere Company and inventor of the first steel plow. <b>His</b> <b>invention</b> was of significance to the entire United States and made large scale cultivation of areas in Illinois, Indiana and Ohio possible. When the U.S. National Register of Historic Places was established in 1966 the John Deere House and Shop was among the first properties to join that list. It was added to the National Register on October 15, 1966, the same day the National Register was established.|$|E
5|$|Increased wartime {{manufacturing}} and industrial growth in Hoosier {{cities and towns}} ushered {{in a new era}} of economic prosperity. By the end of the war, Indiana had become less rural that it previously had been. Overall, the war caused Indiana's industries to grow exponentially, although the state's southern counties experienced growth after the war at a slower rate than its other counties. The state's population shifted to central and northern Indiana as new industries and cities began to develop around the Great Lakes and the railroad depots erected during the war. In 1876 Colonel Eli Lilly opened a new pharmaceutical laboratory in Indianapolis, founding what later became Eli Lilly and Company. Indianapolis was also the wartime home of Richard Gatling, inventor of the Gatling Gun, one of the world's first machine guns. Although <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> was used in some Civil War-era campaigns, it was not fully adopted for use by the U.S. Army until 1866. Charles Conn, another war veteran, founded C. G. Conn Ltd. in Elkhart, Indiana, where the manufacturing of musical instruments became a new industry for the town.|$|E

5|$|Steel {{made from}} cast iron through oxygenation: The {{earliest}} known production of steel {{is a piece}} of ironware excavated from an archaeological site in Anatolia (Kaman-Kalehoyuk) and is about 4,000 years old. Other ancient steel comes from East Africa, dating back to 1400 BC. In the 4th century BC steel weapons like the Falcata were produced in the Iberian Peninsula, while Noric steel was used by the Roman military. The Chinese, who had been producing cast iron from the late Spring and Autumn period (722–481 BC), produced steel by the 2nd century BC through a process of decarburization, i.e. using bellows to pump large amounts of oxygen on to molten cast iron. This was first described in the Han Dynasty (202 BC– 220 AD) book Huainanzi, compiled by scholars under Prince Liu An (179–122 BC). For steel, they used both quenching (i.e. rapid cooling) and tempering (i.e. slow cooling) methods of heat treatment. Much later, the American inventor William Kelly (1811–1888) brought four Chinese metallurgists to Eddyville, Kentucky in 1845, whose expertise in steelmaking influenced his ideas about air injection to reduce carbon content of iron; <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> anticipated the Bessemer process of English inventor Henry Bessemer (1813–1898).|$|E
5|$|The most {{definitive}} replication {{attempts were}} performed by Sir Charles Algernon Parsons. A prominent scientist and engineer known for <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> of the steam turbine, he spent about 40 years (1882–1922) and a considerable {{part of his}} fortune trying to reproduce the experiments of Moissan and Hannay, but also adapted processes of his own. Parsons {{was known for his}} painstakingly accurate approach and methodical record keeping; all his resulting samples were preserved for further analysis by an independent party. He wrote a number of articles—some of the earliest on HPHT diamond—in which he claimed to have produced small diamonds. However, in 1928, he authorized Dr. C.H. Desch to publish an article in which he stated his belief that no synthetic diamonds (including those of Moissan and others) had been produced up to that date. He suggested that most diamonds that had been produced up to that point were likely synthetic spinel.|$|E
5|$|In Gotham City, {{some time}} after {{defeating}} the Penguin, the crime fighter Batman defuses a hostage situation caused by a criminal known as Two-Face, the alter ego of the former district attorney Harvey Dent, but Two-Face escapes and remains at large. Edward Nygma, a researcher at Wayne Enterprises who idolizes Bruce Wayne, has developed a device that can beam television into a person's brain. Bruce offers to let Nygma come up with schematics for the device {{and set up a}} meeting with his assistant. However, after Nygma demands an answer from him immediately, Bruce rejects the invention, believing it to be too close to mind manipulation. After killing his supervisor Fred Stickley, Nygma resigns and seeks retaliation against Bruce for rejecting <b>his</b> <b>invention</b> and begins to send him riddles (Nygma rigs the security cameras to record Stickley committing suicide, as well as a suicide note, which everybody believes but Bruce Wayne doubts this is the truth) A news report reveals how Harvey Dent became Two-Face: when he was prosecuting a mob boss named Sal Maroni, Maroni threw acid on Dent's face, disfiguring half of it. Batman tried to save him, but failed. After the incident, Dent seeks to kill Batman for failing to save him. Bruce meets Chase Meridian, a psychiatrist who is obsessed with Batman, and invites her to come with him to a circus event. After a performance from the circus performers, The Flying Graysons, Two-Face arrives and threatens to blow up the circus unless Batman comes forward and surrenders his life to him. The Flying Graysons attempt to stop Two-Face, but most of them get killed as a result. Only Dick Grayson, the youngest member, survives as he climbs to the roof and throws Two-Face's bomb into a river.|$|E
