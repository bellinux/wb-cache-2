5|$|It is {{possible}} that Æthelberht was converted to Christianity before Augustine's arrival. Æthelberht's wife was a Christian and brought a Frankish bishop with her, to attend her at court, so Æthelberht would have had knowledge of Christianity before the mission reached Kent. It also {{is possible}} that Bede had the date of Æthelberht's death wrong; <b>if,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> Æthelberht died in 618, this {{would be consistent with}} his baptism in 597, which is in accord with the tradition that Augustine converted the king within a year of his arrival.|$|E

25|$|<b>If</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> {{there was}} no third road wheel, the chariot might have functioned as a compass if turns were always made so {{that one of the}} two wheels was {{stationary}} and only the other rotated, with the pointing doll connected to it by gears. The charioteer could have kept the stationary wheel from turning by controlling the horses appropriately. (A brake would have helped, but {{there is no mention of}} one in the description.) The radius of the curve around which the rotating wheel moved would have equalled the track-width of the chariot, and the gears turning the doll would have been chosen accordingly. This design would have worked as a compass for short journeys, but would have suffered from cumulative errors if used for long ones. Also, the chariot would have been slow and awkward to turn. This might not have mattered if turns were rarely executed.|$|E
500|$|Although nephews {{were the}} most common {{relation}} to be elevated to the College, other family members include (legitimate, illegitimate, or adopted) sons and grandsons, brothers, grandnephews, cousins and even uncles. [...] At least 15, and possibly as many as 19 cardinal-nephews were later elected pope (Gregory IX, Alexander IV, Adrian V, Gregory XI, Boniface IX, Innocent VII, Eugene IV, Paul II, Alexander VI, Pius III, Julius II, Leo X, Clement VII, Benedict XIII, and Pius VII, perhaps also John XIX, Benedict IX, if they were really promoted cardinals, as well as Innocent III and Benedict XII, <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> they were related to their elevators).

500|$|The {{story of}} the Tree That Owns Itself is very widely known, and is almost always {{presented}} as fact. However, only one person—the anonymous author of [...] "Deeded to Itself"—has ever claimed to have seen Jackson’s deed to the tree. Most writers acknowledge that the deed is lost or no longer exists, <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> it ever did. Such a deed, {{even if it did}} exist, would have no legal standing. Under common law, the person receiving the property in question must have the legal capacity to receive it, and the property must be delivered to—and accepted by—the recipient.|$|E
500|$|Some {{exceptions}} are also made for [...] "impossible attempts", which {{are divided into}} legal impossibility, impossibility through ineptitude and physical impossibility. Cases of legal impossibility occur when the defendant attempts to do something which he believes to be illegal, which is in fact not; this does not constitute a crime. This defence does, however, remain for common law conspiracies. Impossibility through ineptitude is where the defendant attempts {{to commit a crime}} with inadequate means, in which case he can be found guilty. However, prosecutors' discretion {{is likely to be a}} factor, since some plans [...] for example murder through a voodoo doll [...] may be simply too removed from the attempted crime. Physical impossibility covers situations where not only is the action inadequate, but impossible; an example is the attempted murder of (or conspiracy to murder) someone who is, in fact, already dead. Such actions are governed by section 1(2) and 1(3) of the 1981 Act, which provides that they do constitute a crime if the actions, were the facts of the case to be as the defendant believed them to be, would have led to a valid attempt; as Herring states, [...] "if the defendant believes he is dealing in illegal drugs he can be convicted of an attempted drug-dealing offence, even <b>if</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact</b> what he is selling is chalk". A plan which successfully comes to fruition without the offence the defendant intended coming to pass may also relieve the defendant of liability, although this ruling from Haughton v Smith has proved hard to distinguish from the abolition of other defences of impossibility.|$|E

In August 2017, Rampino, Maximilliano Rocca [...] and Jaime Baez Presser followed up with a paper [...] providing further seismic and magnetic evidence that the structure is an impact crater. Estimates for the age of the structure range up to 250 millions years old. <b>If,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> this is an impact crater, it would be substantially larger than the 65 million year old Chicxulub impact crater which is associated with a significant, but smaller extinction event.|$|E

"Collectivism" [...] and [...] "anti-authoritarianism" [...] was {{cemented}} {{into the}} mutineers core values {{and all of}} these beliefs would influence the decision to turn pirate and how they would conduct themselves thereafter.

2500|$|According to Mullaly, Pratt {{had begun}} {{training}} some {{two months before}} the 1938 season had started, and had played well in some of the club's practice games; only to have complained, once again, of ankle problems. He was appointed vice-captain to Herbie Matthews two weeks before the season began. Although not playing, he was retained on South Melbourne's training list – and, as a consequence, was receiving £1 a week – and only seemed to become anxious about the condition of his ankle as the closing date for clearances had approached, and had asked for the club to arrange another X-ray. Mullaly thought that it was [...] "absurd" [...] for Pratt to contemplate gaining a clearance to another club <b>if,</b> <b>in</b> <b>fact,</b> he was not fit to play for South Melbourne.
