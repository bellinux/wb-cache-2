5|$|Fresh <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> readily available, {{caught off}} Israel's coastal {{areas of the}} Mediterranean and the Red Sea, or in the Sea of Galilee, or raised in ponds {{in the wake of}} {{advances}} in fish farming in Israel. Fresh <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> served whole, in the Mediterranean style, grilled, or fried, dressed only with freshly squeezed lemon juice. Trout (called forel), gilthead seabream (called denisse), St. Peter's fish (known as 'musht') and other fresh fish are prepared this way. Fish are also eaten baked, with or without vegetables, or fried whole or in slices, or grilled over coals, and served with different sauces.|$|E

50|$|Game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> <b>fish</b> {{pursued by}} {{recreational}} anglers. They can be freshwater or saltwater fish. Game <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> eaten after being caught. Some game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also targeted commercially, particularly salmon.|$|R
50|$|Hunting and <b>fishing</b> <b>are</b> {{popular among}} the {{residents}} of the town. Hunters chiefly pursue white-tailed deer, pheasant, quail, and raccoon. Local <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> focused on catfish. Other game animals and <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> also found in the area.|$|R
5|$|There are Pennsylvania State Game Lands in the watershed, {{as well as}} a lake {{known as}} the Briar Creek Reservoir. In the lake, the most common species of <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> yellow perch.|$|E
5|$|A typical <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> ectothermic, has a {{streamlined}} body for rapid swimming, extracts oxygen from water using gills or uses an accessory breathing organ to breathe atmospheric oxygen, has {{two sets of}} paired fins, usually one or two (rarely three) dorsal fins, an anal fin, and a tail fin, has jaws, has skin that is usually covered with scales, and lays eggs.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the main}} stem of Shamokin Creek is {{designated}} as a Warmwater Fishery, all of its tributaries are designated as Coldwater Fisheries. Some tributaries, such as North Branch Shamokin Creek and Quaker Run, lack fish life. However, several fish species have been observed in Carbon Run and downstream tributaries such as Trout Run, Bennys Run, Millers Run, and Lick Creek have supported healthy communities of aquatic life. Additionally, a small hatchery for <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> maintained {{at the mouth of}} Trout Run by local sportsmen.|$|E

25|$|Like coastal {{demersal}} fish, {{deep sea}} demersal <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> divided into benthic fish and benthopelagic fish, where the benthic <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> negatively buoyant and benthopelagic <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> neutrally buoyant.|$|R
5|$|Cheating, where {{either a}} cleaner {{sometimes}} harms its client, or a predatory species mimics a cleaner, also occurs. Predatory cheating {{is analogous to}} Batesian mimicry, as where a harmless hoverfly mimics a stinging wasp, though with the tables turned. Some genuine cleaner fish, such as gobies and wrasse, have the same colours and patterns, in an example of convergent evolution. Mutual resemblance among cleaner <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> analogous to Mullerian mimicry, as where stinging bees and wasps mimic each other.|$|E
5|$|From {{the figure}} 8, {{it is clear}} that an economy {{operating}} at a position where the MRS of either Crusoe or Friday is not equal to the MRT between coconuts and fish cannot be Pareto efficient. This is because the rate at which, say Friday is willing to trade coconuts for <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> different from the rate at which coconuts can be transformed into fish. Thus, {{there is a way to}} make Friday better off by rearranging the production pattern.|$|E
5|$|Muskrats have {{sometimes}} been a food resource for North Americans. In the southeastern portion of Michigan, a longstanding dispensation allows Catholics to consume muskrat as their Friday penance, on Ash Wednesday, and on Lenten Fridays (when the eating of meat, except for <b>fish,</b> <b>is</b> prohibited); this tradition {{dates back to}} at least the early 19th century.|$|E
50|$|In Hinduism, The Rainbow <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> a <b>fish</b> that <b>was</b> {{as large}} as a whale. It ate Buddha, an {{incarnation}} of the deity Vishnu. The Rainbow <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> caught and killed by some fishermen who freed Buddha from its stomach. After The Rainbow <b>Fish</b> <b>was</b> caught, it provided an entire nation with food for a year.|$|R
50|$|Oily <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> {{contrasted with}} white fish, which contain oil {{only in the}} liver, and much less overall than oily fish. Examples of white <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> cod, haddock and flatfish. White <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> usually {{demersal}} <b>fish</b> which live {{on or near the}} seafloor, whereas oily <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> pelagic, living in the water column away from the bottom.|$|R
50|$|Coarse <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> a {{term used}} in the United Kingdom and Ireland for angling for coarse <b>fish.</b> Coarse <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> {{freshwater}} <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> distinguished from game fish. Freshwater game <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> all salmonids - most particularly salmon, trout and char - so generally coarse <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> freshwater <b>fish</b> that <b>are</b> not salmonids. There is disagreement over whether grayling should be classified as a game fish or a coarse <b>fish.</b> Fly <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> the technique usually used for freshwater game fishing, while other angling techniques are usually used for coarse fishing. The sport of coarse fishing and the techniques it uses are particularly popular in the United Kingdom and mainland Europe, and {{as well as in}} some former British Commonwealth countries and among British expatriates.|$|R
5|$|North American river otters, {{like most}} predators, prey upon the most readily {{accessible}} species. <b>Fish</b> <b>is</b> a favored food among the otters, {{but they also}} consume various amphibians (such as salamanders and frogs), freshwater clams, mussels, snails, small turtles and crayfish. The most common fish consumed are perch, suckers, and catfish. Instances of river otters eating small mammals, such as mice and squirrels, and occasionally birds have been reported as well.|$|E
5|$|Philippe Poisson (born 1984), {{better known}} as Phil <b>Fish,</b> <b>is</b> a French-Canadian former indie game {{designer}} {{best known for his}} work on the 2012 platform game Fez published by his company, Polytron Corporation.

He studied game design at the Montreal National Animation and Design Centre, and worked at Ubisoft and Artificial Mind and Movement before starting Polytron in 2008.|$|E
5|$|Surnames {{behave in}} similar ways in other languages; {{for example in}} France, {{surnames}} can be toponymic, metonymic, or may record nicknames ("sobriquets"). Poisson (<b>Fish)</b> <b>is</b> a metonym for a fishmonger or fisherman. Loiseau (The bird) and Lechat (The cat) are nicknames, Lechat indicating either a flexible man or a hypocrite, Loiseau suggesting a lightly-built birdlike person. In Sweden, the surname Falk (Falcon) is common; it is found among Swedish nobility from 1399.|$|E

5|$|The Bhagavata Purana and the Kathasaritsagara continue, that on {{advice of}} Shiva, Rati assumes {{the form of}} Sambara's kitchen-maid Mayavati and awaits her husband's arrival in Sambara's house. Sambara is foretold that the reborn Kama would be his destroyer. Sambara finds out that Kama was born as Pradyumna, the son of Krishna and his wife Rukmini. He steals the child and throws him in the ocean, where the child is {{swallowed}} by a fish. This <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> caught by fishermen and sent to Sambara's kitchen. When the <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> cut, the child is found by Mayavati, who decides to nurture him. The divine sage Narada reveals to Mayavati that she was Rati and the child was Kama and she was to rear him. As the child grew up, the motherly love of Mayavati changes to the passionate love of a wife. The reborn Kama resents her advances, as he considers her his mother. Mayavati tells him the secret of their previous births as narrated by Narada {{and that he was}} not her son, but that of Krishna and Rukmini. Mayavati trains Pradyumna in magic and war and advises him to kill Sambara. Pradyumna defeats Sambara and slays him. He returns to Dvārakā, Krishna's capital with Mayavati as his wife, where they are welcomed.|$|E
5|$|The {{back of the}} <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> {{iridescent}} and blue-green in color, {{with many}} yellow and gold spots. The belly is white. The head color changes from a light blue to a pinkish mix during spawning season. Specimens have a tone of blue under their eyes. Their pectoral fins are a light tone of sepia, and {{the margin of the}} anal fin is a purplish-blue color.|$|E
5|$|The {{body of a}} <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> {{divided into}} a head, trunk and tail, {{although}} the divisions between the three are not always externally visible. The skeleton, which forms the support structure inside the <b>fish,</b> <b>is</b> either made of cartilage, in cartilaginous fish, or bone in bony fish. The main skeletal element is the vertebral column, composed of articulating vertebrae which are lightweight yet strong. The ribs attach to the spine {{and there are no}} limbs or limb girdles. The main external features of the fish, the fins, are composed of either bony or soft spines called rays, which {{with the exception of the}} caudal fins, have no direct connection with the spine. They are supported by the muscles which compose the main part of the trunk. The heart has two chambers and pumps the blood through the respiratory surfaces of the gills and on round the body in a single circulatory loop. The eyes are adapted for seeing underwater and have only local vision. There is an inner ear but no external or middle ear. Low frequency vibrations are detected by the lateral line system of sense organs that run along the length of the sides of fish, and these respond to nearby movements and to changes in water pressure.|$|E
50|$|Cironka (Циронка) is a {{traditional}} Macedonian dish. It originates from Prespa region. This dish is made from common bleak. The fresh <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> salted {{with a lot of}} salt until they become whitish. Then, the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> left in a bowl for six to seven days. The bowl must be covered and except the fish, we can put some nettle. After that, the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> threaded and they're left to dry on sunny weather, until they get hard. Then the <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> fried on both sides, and placed in hot water to become less salty. The <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> served with some peppermint, oil, vinegar and garlic.|$|R
50|$|These <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> often migratory forage fish, which feed on plankton, and {{the larger}} fish that follow and feed on the forage fish. Examples of migratory forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> herring, anchovies, capelin, and menhaden. Examples of larger pelagic fish which prey on the forage <b>fish</b> <b>are</b> billfish, tuna, and oceanic sharks.|$|R

5|$|The <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> carnivorous, {{with its}} prey {{consisting}} mainly of benthic invertebrates and fishes. Such food items include polychaetes, gastropods, bivalve mollusks, rock crabs, cancer crabs, spider crabs, lobsters, shrimps, squids, and fishes including spiny dogfish, alewife, Atlantic herring, menhaden, hakes, sculpins, cunner, tautog, sand lance, butterfish, and various flounders. Juveniles primarily subsist on benthic invertebrates such as polychaetes, copepods, amphipods, isopods, crangon shrimp, and euphausiids. Individuals {{have been found}} with the denticles on the snout worn smooth, indicating that the snout is used to dig in the mud or sand to obtain bivalve mollusks.|$|E
5|$|The newly hatched {{young of}} oviparous fish are called larvae. They are usually poorly formed, carry a large yolk sac (for nourishment), {{and are very}} {{different}} in appearance from juvenile and adult specimens. The larval period in oviparous <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> relatively short (usually only several weeks), and larvae rapidly grow and change appearance and structure (a process termed metamorphosis) to become juveniles. During this transition larvae must switch from their yolk sac to feeding on zooplankton prey, a process which depends on typically inadequate zooplankton density, starving many larvae.|$|E
5|$|The {{story of}} Jaws {{is limited by}} how the humans respond to the shark menace. The <b>fish</b> <b>is</b> given much detail, with {{descriptions}} of its anatomy and presence creating the sense of an unstoppable threat. Elevating the menace are violent descriptions of the shark attacks. Along with a carnivorous killer on the sea, Amity is populated with equally predatory humans: the mayor has ties with the mafia, an adulterous housewife, criminals among the tourists.|$|E

5000|$|Jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> an {{unlimited}} class tackle method of fishing that uses lines suspended from floating jugs to catch fish in lakes or rivers. Often, {{a large number}} of jugs are used when jug fishing. In many states, a fisherman could use up to twenty, and jug sets of around twenty are common in practice. [...] Jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> most common in southern states where many different kinds of people jug <b>fish.</b> Jugs <b>are</b> often put out at sunset and picked up at sunrise by the whole family. Jug fishing consists of a simple setup where lines are tied onto jugs and weights can be added to the line to keep the jug's location fixed. Jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> also subjected to numerous Department of Natural Resources and local water regulations that could include: the number of jugs, dates and times when jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> allowed, and if jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> even allowed. Many <b>fish</b> can <b>be</b> caught on jugs, but the main target of jug <b>fishing</b> <b>is</b> often catfish.|$|R
