In order to avoid the city centre, General Oskar Potiorek decided that the royal car should travel straight along the Appel Quay to the Sarajevo Hospital. However, Potiorek <b>forgot</b> to inform <b>the</b> <b>driver,</b> Leopold Loyka, about this decision. On the way to the hospital, Loyka took a right turn into Franz Josef Street. [...] Princip was standing near Moritz Schiller's café when he spotted the car as it drove past, having taken the wrong turn. After realizing <b>the</b> mistake, <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> put his foot on the brake, and began to reverse. In doing so the engine stalled and the gears locked, giving Princip his opportunity. Princip stepped forward, drew his pistol, an FN Model 1910, and at a distance of about 1.5 metres (5ft) fired twice into the car, first hitting Franz Ferdinand in the neck, and then hitting his wife Sophie in the abdomen, after she covered his body. They both died before 11:00 am.|$|R

60|$|At {{the corner}} of the Haymarket, he very jauntily hailed a hansom cab; jumped in; bade the fellow drive him to a part of the Embankment, which he named; {{and as soon as the}} vehicle was in motion, {{concealed}} the bag as completely as he could under the vantage of the apron, and once more drew out his watch. So he rode for five interminable minutes, his heart in his mouth at every jolt, scarce able to possess his terrors, yet fearing to wake the attention of <b>the</b> <b>driver</b> by too obvious a change of plan, and willing, if possible, to leave him time to <b>forget</b> <b>the</b> Gladstone bag.|$|R
