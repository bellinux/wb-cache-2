At Eton, John Vaughan Wilkes, his former headmaster's son recalled, [...] "...he was extremely argumentative – about anything – and criticising the masters and criticising the other boys... We enjoyed arguing with him. He would generally win the arguments – or think he had anyhow." [...] Roger Mynors concurs: [...] "Endless arguments about all sorts of things, in which {{he was one of the}} great leaders. He was one of those boys who thought for himself..." ...|$|E
2500|$|Billie Whitelaw {{worked with}} Beckett for 25 years on such plays as Not I, Eh Joe, Krapp's Last Tape, and Footfalls and Rockaby. She first met Beckett in 1963. In her {{autobiography}} she describes {{their first meeting}} in 1963 was [...] "trust at first sight". Beckett went on to write many of his experimental theatre works for her. She came {{to be regarded as}} his muse, the [...] "supreme interpreter of his work", perhaps most famous for her role as the mouth in Not I. She said of the play Rockaby: [...] "I put the tape in my head. And I sort of look in a particular way, but not at the audience. Sometimes as a director Beckett comes out with absolute gems and I use them a lot in other areas. We were doing Happy Days and I just did not know where in the theatre to look during this particular section. And I asked, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>for</b> a bit and then said, 'Inward' [...] ". She said of her role in Footfalls: [...] "I felt like a moving, musical Edvard Munch painting and, in fact, when Beckett was directing Footfalls he was not only using me to play the notes but I almost felt that he did have the paintbrush out and was painting." [...] "Sam knew that I would turn myself inside out to give him what he wanted", she explained. [...] "With all of Sam's work, the scream was there, my task was to try to get it out." [...] She stopped performing his plays in 1989 when he died.|$|E
2500|$|Sound {{design for}} the film was handled by Martín Hernández, {{who has worked on}} all the director's feature films. The {{production}} sound his team was given was [...] "surprisingly perfect and clean", so they didn't need to spend much time tidying it. The lack of visual cuts in the film meant a departure from the usual way Hernández edited sound though. [...] "Normally Alejandro likes, as he calls it, 'the clashing of the sounds.' The camera changes angle within the scene and there is a change of everything backgrounds, texture, dialog. Obviously, that would not work on Birdman because here, everything is flowing." [...] Additionally, the sound of objects in the film needed to be coordinated with their position onscreen, a non-trivial task since the camera was nearly always moving. Hernández also helped to cut Sánchez's tracks, selecting and editing moments from the New York recordings against the film. When the tracks were re-recording in Los Angeles, in order [...] "to have distance, and closeness and resonance" [...] the team used thirty two microphones for each take. Hernández described the job as [...] "crazy". A large challenge of the post-production soundwork was designing the sound of the theatre audience, particularly in the scene when Mike is drunk and comes out of character. Iñárritu knew how he wanted the audience to respond, but figuring out the sound of their reaction took four months of work from five sound designers. Hernández said <b>he</b> <b>thought,</b> <b>for</b> a film in general, that the narrative created by sound [...] "provokes more 'explosions'" [...] than that created by images, and that in Birdman [...] "Alejandro has sound exploding all throughout the film." ...|$|E
