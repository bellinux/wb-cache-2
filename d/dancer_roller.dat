Maintaining web tension in the entire processing line under changing web speed is {{a key factor in}} achieving good final product quality. Many industrial applications use dancer position feedback to indirectly regulate tension. Although widely used in the industry, pendulum dancers (rotational motion of the <b>dancer</b> <b>roller)</b> have received very little attention in the literature compared to linear ones (translational motion). The lack of clearly identified controllers synthesis methods can thus be noticed, as industry typically uses hand-tuned decentralized PI controllers. An improved alternative based on methods is proposed in this paper to provide a systematic framework. The focus in this study is the unwind section of a processing line that contains a pendulum dancer (PD). The nonlinear and linear phenomenological models of the unwind section containing the PD are discussed first. The position controller based on dancer position feedback is synthesized using the standard approach with mixed sensitivity. Because of the high order of the controllers synthesized with this approach, techniques to generate reduced-order controllers are used to calculate a fixed-order controller resembling standard industrial practice. The performance of the proposed controllers is demonstrated by carrying out experiments on a large experimental web handling platform containing four driven rollers, many idle rollers, and a PD in the unwind section. To the best of our knowledge, these are the first published results of successful application of an controller to a real plant containing a PD...|$|E

40|$|Roller dance, simply {{dancing on}} skates, is largely uninvestigated. Therefore, this thesis {{begins with a}} general overview, which is {{followed}} by {{an investigation of the}} effects of marginality resulting from gender, racial, and occupational discrimination. Focusing on general patterns of interaction, norms, and values, the author outlines the subculture of Philadelphia Roller Dance Performers, (2) examines the effect of <b>roller</b> <b>dancers</b> on the images of roller dance and more generally roller skating, and (3) determines, to what extent, roller dance, with its numerous associations, effects the lives of these skaters and others i. e., function of roller dance. All four areas of investigation involve the perceptions of non-skaters and social values. Much of the information is taken from the perspectives of <b>roller</b> <b>dancers.</b> Methodology includes two short interviews with V and E, contemporary choreographers of Wheels of Fire. These choreographers/leaders combine masculine and feminine moves in their routines to be performed simultaneously by male and female members, focus on feeling as opposed to form, accept different bodies, and break down hierarchies. Their work and actions challenge gender, racial, and occupational stereotypes...|$|R

[...] "Holler" [...] was done as the album version, though a dance interlude was added before the third verse. [...] "Who Do You Think You Are?" [...] was remixed into an orchestral song. [...] "Never Give Up On The Good Times" [...] had an interlude before the final verse and the girls acted as superheroes. [...] "Wannabe" [...] was also remixed for the tour and [...] "Goodbye" [...] was performed with a choir and ended with a long orchestral interlude as the girls left the stage.|$|R
5000|$|A roller disco is a discothèque or {{skating rink}} {{where all the}} <b>dancers</b> wear <b>roller</b> skates of some kind (traditional quad or inline). The music played is modern and easily danceable, {{historically}} disco but in modern times including almost any form of dance, pop or rock music. The concept originated as a fad in the 1970s when the disco craze was at its height, peaking around 1980 and inspiring several roller-disco magazines. In 1984 the fad arrived in the United Kingdom and many roller discos popped {{up all over the}} country [...] , the craze has largely discontinued, although many 1970s era roller-discos are still open and successful. Also, it experienced a mild revival in the early 2000s, especially in the mid-eastern United States, where certain clubs continue to host roller disco nights. Some now use in-line roller-blades. Roller discos are also popular among older children and young teenagers, especially for parties. As in other discos, special effects such as fog machines and flashing traffic lights are often used. [...] To minimise the risk of injury, the organisers of roller discos often only allow participants to skate in one direction at a time, so that they do not crash into one another, although many roller discos have a [...] "free skate" [...] section {{in the middle of the}} roller rink.|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} {{explores the}} ways in which notions of gender, sexuality, identity, and body are reified, destabilized, complicated, and in some cases, politicized by participants within two contemporary, female-dominated, leisure-based activities. I argue that neo-burlesque dance and flat-track roller derby offer women performative opportunities to transgress cultural norms regarding gender and sexual identities, and the appearance and performance of the physical body. My research investigates how neo-burlesque <b>dancers</b> and flat-track <b>roller</b> derby skaters negotiate their “alternative femininities” interactionally, performatively, corporeally, and rhetorically. Using a combination of ethnography, participant observation, in-depth interviewing, and content analysis, I examine how femininities are constructed in subcultures created explicitly by and for women, how burlesque dancers and derby skaters embody and perform these potentially transgressive femininities, how femininities are “queered” and/or deconstructed rhetorically, and whether modern-day burlesque dancers and derby skaters view what they do as oppositional or political. ...|$|R

"Music" [...] {{was later}} {{added to the}} Re-Invention Tour in 2004 as the {{penultimate}} song; this mix of the song was slower, hip-hop-based, and featured Madonna and her dancers wearing Scottish kilts. Also present was a lighted staircase surrounding a DJ Station. The performance ended with Madonna and her dancers lifting up their kilts to spell the word “FREEDOM”, with glitter letters on their underpants. MTV's Corey Moss opined that during the performance [...] "Madonna and her dancers transformed the arena into a steamy nightclub". A performance of [...] "Music" [...] from the tour, was included on the I'm Going to Tell You a Secret live album and documentary. The same version was used at the 2005 Live 8 benefit concert in London. [...] On the 2006 Confessions Tour, Madonna performed a mashup of [...] "Music" [...] and The Trammps's [...] "Disco Inferno" [...] titled [...] "Music Inferno". It began with several <b>dancers</b> on <b>roller</b> skates emerging from beneath the stage to perform [...] "Xanadu-worthy tricks", while the stage was bathed in deep red lights. Madonna appeared wearing a [...] "sleeker version of John Travolta's Saturday Night Fever white suit" [...] and performed the track. The performance also included a sample from her song [...] "Where's The Party", from her third studio album True Blue (1986), at the beginning. Halfway through the performance, Madonna walked to the center stage where, according to Corey Moss, she did [...] "her best Saturday Night Fever-era John Travolta routine, complete with the 'hitchhike' (you know, thumbs to the side)". The performance of the song at the August 15–16, 2006 shows in London, at the Wembley Arena, were recorded and included on both the CD and DVD version of Madonna's second live album, The Confessions Tour, released in 2007.|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} {{article is}} a collection of images looking at how youth counter cultural groups of urban <b>dancers,</b> skateboarders and <b>roller</b> skaters reappropriate a commercial space in East London and reimagine a pluralist playground. The narratives of trespass and occupation of Stratford Centre—a "private-public" space used both as a shopping centre and a 24 -hour thoroughfare—are visually explored through photographs depicting moments of happiness, sharing, friendship and creative collaboration between young people. This work challenges the concepts of public space and common right to the city by unveiling the marginalisation and exclusion of these young alternative cultures and the lack of formal urban spaces for (young) people to engage in different activities—more spontaneous and recreational than the ones of work and consumption. Through subversive practices, the young people gathering at night in the underused space of the shopping centre reclaim and take back their right to socialise, express themselves and play. They suggest alternative and sensory rich ways of experiencing urban space and create possibilities of action that are not offered by the capitalist city. Driven by the desire to positively represent this vibrant and inclusive place, this body of work attempts to convey something of the atmosphere of an open space characterised by great social cohesion and performed by a community of young talented people. peer-reviewe...|$|R

Houston-located rapper Nosaprise {{also makes a}} cameo appearance. The video opens with Beyoncé and her sister riding lowrider bicycles, getting to a roller rink where several people are already gathered. Shots of people roler-skating inside the rink with disco balls {{hanging from the ceiling}} follow. The singer is then seen performing a dance with several background dancers as they hold rollers in their hands and enter a place called [...] "Roller City USA". Beyoncé starts skating and performing dance moves in slow-motion with several of her dancers dressed in shorts and T-shirts. Several scenes which are shot in bright black light follow as Beyoncé performs another dance sequence along with her <b>dancers</b> on their <b>rollers.</b> The second, more uptempo part of the song starts and the singer is seen arriving with a vehicle in front of a place called [...] "Cherry". She dances atop the car and dances with her background band as they play the song on their keytars. As the song progresses, smoke starts appearing {{out of the car and}} on the scene where she is with her band. During the end of the video, Beyoncé and her sister are seen going away on the same path by which they came. Close-up shots of Beyoncé lip-syncing the song are intertwined in the video with her lips covered with a shiny lipstick.|$|R
