5|$|The second fight {{began with}} Jackson moving forward {{and getting into}} a clinch early. The two {{exchanged}} strikes in this position before breaking up. Jackson followed by throwing a brief <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> punches and landing a knee. About halfway into the first round, Silva threw a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> punches and landed several knees from the Muay Thai Clinch before pushing Jackson against the turnbuckle. Jackson scrambled out of the clinch and scored a takedown {{with a combination of}} a leg trip and a headlock. Jackson attacked with ground and pound, but to limited damage, while Silva attempted submissions unsuccessfully. The referee then stood the fighters up due to inactivity.|$|E
5|$|As president-elect, Taylor {{kept his}} {{distance}} from Washington, not resigning his Western Division command until late January 1849. He spent the {{months following the}} election formulating his cabinet selections. He was deliberate and quiet about his decisions, to the frustration of his fellow Whigs. While he despised patronage and political games, he endured a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> advances from office-seekers looking {{to play a role}} in his administration.|$|E
5|$|In 1777, Henry Hamilton, a British Lieutenant Governor of Canada, {{began to}} recruit American Indian war parties to raid the Kentucky settlements. On April 24, Shawnee Indians led by Chief Blackfish {{attacked}} Boonesborough. Boone {{was shot in}} the ankle while outside the fort, but he was carried back inside amid a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> bullets by Simon Kenton, a recent arrival at Boonesborough. Kenton became Boone's close friend, as well as a legendary frontiersman in his own right.|$|E

5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> diplomatic activity geared towards forming a new coalition against France, and by April 1805, Britain and Russia had signed an alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France, and being keen on revenge, Austria joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
5|$|In later years, {{there was}} a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> {{contradictory}} statements from convention members (including Mason) about who composed which articles. Randolph credited Henry with Articles 15 and 16, but the latter (dealing with religious freedom), was written by Madison. Mason had imitated English law in drafting language requiring toleration of those of minority religions, but Madison insisted on full religious liberty, and Mason supported Madison's amendment once made.|$|E
5|$|M-theory is {{a theory}} in physics that unifies all {{consistent}} versions of superstring theory. The existence of such a theory was first conjectured by Edward Witten at a string theory conference at the University of Southern California {{in the spring of}} 1995. Witten's announcement initiated a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> research activity known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
50|$|The sky was {{overcast}} {{with occasional}} <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> rain and a stiff, raw {{wind from the}} northeast greatly affected both Travis's and Blackwell's driving. The match was over 36 holes of golf.|$|R

5|$|Popular {{demand for}} Greek New Testaments {{led to a}} <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> further {{authorized}} and unauthorized editions in the early sixteenth century; almost {{all of which were}} based on Erasmus's work and incorporated his particular readings, although typically also making a number of minor changes of their own. Tregelles gives Acts 13:33 {{as an example of the}} places in which commonly received text did not follow Erasmian text (εν τω ψαλμω τω πρωτω → εν τω ψαλμω τω δευτερω).|$|E
5|$|The Petition {{caused a}} <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> {{broadside}} satires, poems and ballads {{on the subject}} through the following year. The historian James Turner identifies this event {{as an example of}} a new carnivalisation of sexuality in Restoration England, where genuine political attack, satire, street commentary and bawdy theatre came together. Two years after the riots, a mob gathered once more and again swore they would raze Cresswell's cathouse to the ground, though protection from the local beadles prevented the attack.|$|E
5|$|The {{death of}} Gaius in AD4 {{initiated}} a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> {{activity in the}} household of Augustus. Tiberius was adopted as full son and heir and in turn, he was required to adopt his nephew, Germanicus, the son of his brother Drusus and Augustus' niece Antonia Minor. Along with his adoption, Tiberius received tribunician power {{as well as a}} share of Augustus's maius imperium, something that even Marcus Agrippa may never have had.|$|E
60|$|She sat {{for some}} minutes, {{gazing into the}} fire. Little spurts of flame whistled comfortably {{in the heart of}} the black-red coals. Outside the storm shrieked faintly, and <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> rain dashed {{themselves}} against the window.|$|R
25|$|With Volumina (1961–62, revised 1966) for solo organ, Ligeti {{continued}} with clusters of notes, translated into blocks of sound. Conventional music notation was abandoned, {{and replaced by}} diagrams of general pitch areas, duration and <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> notes.|$|R
60|$|The days flew by; spring {{had long}} since given place to summer; the blaze of sun and blast of flying sand were succeeded by the cooling breezes from the mountain; October brought the <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> snow and November the dark storm-clouds.|$|R
5|$|The {{second round}} {{began with the}} two fighters exchanging a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> strikes. Silva then {{attempted}} a takedown {{with a combination of}} a body lock and a trip, but Jackson reversed it into a takedown of his own. The action stayed in Silva's guard very briefly, until the two scrambled back to their feet.|$|E
5|$|Delayed by {{the late}} arrival of the York garrison, it was late evening before the Royalists were fully deployed. A <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> rain showers and the discouragement of Newcastle and Eythin persuaded Rupert to delay his attack until the next day. From {{the ranks of the}} allied army he could hear the singing of psalms. As the Royalist troops broke ranks for their supper, Leven noted the lack of {{preparation}} among his opponents and ordered his men to attack at or shortly after 7:30pm, just as a thunderstorm broke out over the moor.|$|E
5|$|In December 1804, an Anglo-Swedish {{agreement}} led to {{the creation}} of the Third Coalition. British Prime Minister William Pitt spent 1804 and 1805 in a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> diplomatic activity to form a new coalition against France. Mutual suspicion between the British and the Russians eased in the face of several French political mistakes and by April 1805 the two had signed a treaty of alliance. Having been defeated twice in recent memory by France and keen on revenge, Austria also joined the coalition a few months later.|$|E
50|$|Like most old mines, {{there were}} {{occasional}} <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> renewed activity whenever there were prospects of poorer ore lodes being profitably mined, usually {{in response to}} rising metal prices or more efficient extraction technologies, but generally such mining is short-lived as it is extremely price-sensitive.|$|R
60|$|November brought storms {{up on the}} peaks. <b>Flurries</b> <b>of</b> {{snow fell}} in the park every day, but the sunny south side, where Dale's camp lay, {{retained}} its autumnal color and warmth. Not till late in winter did the snow creep over this secluded nook.|$|R
6000|$|... "Now git!" [...] said Andrew, {{coming down}} the steps. The crowd {{scattered}} with laughing taunts. He turned and entered the house.

5|$|One {{response}} to this popularity was in commissioning the construction of replica castles. These were particularly popular at beginning of the 19th century, and again later in the Victorian period. Design manuals were published offering details of how to recreate the appearance of an original Gothic castles in a new build, leading to a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> work, such as Eastnor in 1815, the fake Norman castle of Penrhyn between 1827 and 1837 and the imitation Edwardian castle of Goodrich Court in 1828. The later Victorians built the Welsh Castell Coch in the 1880s as a fantasy Gothic construction and the last such replica, Castle Drogo, was built as late as 1911.|$|E
5|$|Retaining {{his place}} for the third Test that started just days later on the same ground, Kippax {{maintained}} his superb form and hit his maiden Test century in Australia’s first innings. With Australia struggling against the pace of England's Harold Larwood, Kippax steadied the innings and then launched an assault on Larwood, hooking him for four boundaries. Journalist Ray Robinson pointed out that before Kippax’s <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> fours, Larwood had taken 14 wickets at 18.3runs in the series. After, he managed only four wickets for 472runs. Kippax followed up with 41 in the second innings, as Australia fell to their third consecutive defeat in the rubber and lost the Ashes.|$|E
5|$|Speaking at {{the string}} theory {{conference at the}} University of Southern California in 1995, Edward Witten of the Institute for Advanced Study made the {{surprising}} suggestion that all five superstring theories were in fact just different limiting cases of a single theory in eleven spacetime dimensions. Witten's announcement drew together all of the previous results on S- and T-duality {{and the appearance of}} two- and five-dimensional branes in string theory. In the months following Witten's announcement, hundreds of new papers appeared on the Internet confirming that the new theory involved membranes in an important way. Today this <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> work is known as the second superstring revolution.|$|E
50|$|He {{has always}} been ready to lend an ear and share the air with {{absolutely}} anyone who felt they had something to say. This largesse often leads to endless, boring mouthing off, but equally often leads to dynamic, intimate <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> insight, energy, humor and understanding.|$|R
60|$|And she was right. It poured {{steadily}} for two months, {{with occasional}} <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> snow, also thunder, likewise hurricanes, the tramontàna, the sirocco, {{and all the}} other charming features of an Italian winter. That nothing might be wanting, a nice little inundation was got up for their benefit, December 28th.|$|R
50|$|Traffic Light Tree was {{installed}} in 1998 {{on the site of}} a plane tree that was suffering as a result of pollution. It was initially intended that the lights would be triggered to reflect <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> activity on the London Stock Exchange, but this proved to be too expensive to put into practice.|$|R
5|$|Stage eleven was {{marred by}} rainy weather, which caused many splits in the peloton. Fabio Fontanelli won the stage {{as a member of}} the lead group, but tenth-place {{finisher}} Bruno Leali gained a six-second race lead by finishing more than three minutes in front of overall leader Miguel Indurain. The Giro's twelfth stage began with a large climb which led to many attacks. Despite the <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> attacks, the whole peloton eventually made it to the finish line together for a sprint finish that was won by Russian Dimitri Konyshev.|$|E
5|$|The final trigger, however, was the {{discovery}} of gold elsewhere in Canada and Alaska, prompting a new stampede, this {{time away from the}} Klondike. In August 1898, gold had been found at Atlin Lake {{at the head of the}} Yukon River, generating a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> interest, but during the winter of 1898–99 much larger quantities were found at Nome at the mouth of the Yukon. In 1899, a flood of prospectors from across the region left for Nome, 8,000 from Dawson alone during a single week in August. The Klondike gold rush was over.|$|E
5|$|The {{new head}} of state, Ibrahim Babangida, {{declared}} himself president and {{commander in chief of}} the armed forces and of the ruling Supreme Military Council. He set 1990 as the official deadline for a return to democratic governance. Babangida's tenure was marked by a <b>flurry</b> <b>of</b> political activity: he instituted the International Monetary Fund's Structural Adjustment Program (SAP) to aid in the repayment of the country's crushing international debt. At the time most federal revenue was dedicated to servicing that debt. He enrolled Nigeria in the Organization of the Islamic Conference, which aggravated religious tensions in the country.|$|E
60|$|As {{time passed}} on the monotony that {{followed}} their first exciting experiences grew upon them and became oppressive. December weather in Flanders brought cutting winds from off the North Sea and often there were <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> snow in the air. They had steam heat inside the ship but the deck {{was no longer a}} practical lounging place.|$|R
60|$|The snow, {{which had}} been falling all night, lay at {{three o'clock in the}} {{afternoon}} over the fields and the hill. Clumps of withered grass stood out upon the hill-top; the furze bushes were black, and now and then a black shiver crossed the snow as the wind drove <b>flurries</b> <b>of</b> frozen particles before it. The sound was that of a broom sweeping--sweeping.|$|R
60|$|While riding {{over one}} of the cleared eminencies that {{occurred}} in their route, the watchful eye of Judge Temple pointed out to his daughter the approach <b>of</b> a tempest. <b>Flurries</b> <b>of</b> snow already obscured the mountain that formed the northern boundary of the lake, and the genial sensation which had quickened the blood through their veins was already succeeded by the deadening influence of an approaching northwester.|$|R
