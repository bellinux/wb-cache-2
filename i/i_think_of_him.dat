500|$|A {{turning point}} in the book occurs when Rita {{falls in love with a}} gambler named L. D. Tolbrook, who seduces Rita and {{introduces}} her to prostitution. Her mother's hospitalization and death of her brother Bailey's wife drives Rita to her mother's home. She leaves her young son with a caretaker, Big Mary, but when she returns for him, she finds that Big Mary had disappeared with Clyde. She tries to elicit help from Tolbrook, who puts her in her place when she finds him at his home and requests that he help her find her son. She finally realizes that he had been taking advantage of her, but is able to trace Big Mary and Clyde to Bakersfield, California, and has an emotional reunion with her son. She writes, [...] "In the plowed farmyard near Bakersfield, I began to understand that uniqueness of the person. He was three and I was nineteen, and never again would <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a beautiful appendage of myself".|$|E
500|$|In {{an unconstitutional}} though {{widespread}} practice during the Communist witchhunts, the U.S. State Department refused to renew Rossen's passport. This, and {{his inability to}} find work, brought Rossen, like his friend, ex-Communist Elia Kazan, back to the committee in May 1953, where he named 57 people as Communists. [...] He explained to the committee why he chose to testify: [...] "I don't think, {{after two years of}} thinking, that any one individual can indulge himself in the luxury of personal morality or pit it against what I feel today very strongly is the security and safety of this nation." [...] Stephen Rossen later shed light on his father's decision: [...] "It killed him not to work. He was torn between his desire to work and his desire not to talk, and he didn't know what to do. What I think he wanted to know was, what would <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> if he talked? He didn't say it in that way, though. Then he explained to me the politics of it—how the studios were in on it, and there was never any chance of his working. He was under pressure, he was sick, his diabetes was bad, and he was drinking. By this time I understood that he had refused to talk before and had done his time, from my point of view. What could any kid say at that point? You say, 'I love you and I'm behind you.'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In May 1908, as the Olympic trials approached, sports {{reporter}} H.V. Valentine wrote, [...] "No {{figure in}} the world of athletics is attracting more attention these days than that of John G. [...] Garrles, the great all around athlete of the University of Michigan." [...] Another reporter noted, [...] "Garrels is undoubtedly the best all around man the middle west has ever produced. [...] He can hurdle, jump and toss the weights and is sure to gather points for America in the many events in which he can make a strong showing." [...] The Pittsburg Press called Garrels [...] "one of the greatest athletes ever developed in the history of manly sports in America." [...] Even Martin Sheridan (a five-time Olympic gold medalist) opined, [...] "He's the greatest all-around athlete in our country -- that's what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> [...] Some day I hope to meet him, and, win or lose, that will be the greatest day of my life." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, {{you are not}} a mother, and cannot know. Why should <b>I</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> when he {{was good}} and kind, honest and hardworking? And then he had thought of me first. Why should <b>I</b> not <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him?</b> Did not mamma listen to my father when he came to her?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>think</b> ill <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Why do you {{say that}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> ill <b>of</b> <b>him?</b> <b>I</b> <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> <b>him</b> than <b>of</b> anybody else in the world;--but I know his fault, and, as it happens, it is a fault so very {{prejudicial}} to my happiness. You ask me why I got into his boat. Why does any girl get into a man's boat? Why did you get into Lord Chiltern's?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I've {{written to}} another cousin by marriage," [...] said Spindler dubiously, [...] "in case <b>of</b> accident; <b>I</b> didn't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> before, {{because he was}} rich." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It’s no joke," [...] said Mr. Gunnill, severely. [...] "I’ll tell young Herbert what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{trying to}} deceive me like that." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I know he will,' she {{answered}} happily. 'And I'm only prevented from saying all <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{by the fear}} that he'll become perfectly unmanageable.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That, then, is {{the secret}} of it all," [...] she said. [...] "And Giles Winterborne is not for me, and the less <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> the better." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Therefore <b>I</b> must <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> Mrs. Finn. <b>I</b> do {{not wish}} him to be alone. I am sure {{it would be better}} that I should stay with him." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "An' <b>I</b> never <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{with his}} hair parted," [...] Mary confessed, daring the thought and {{shivering}} with apprehension. [...] "He just couldn't have his hair parted. THAT'D be funny." ...|$|R
60|$|That is so {{intensely}} true {{what you}} say about Turner's work being like nature's in its slowness and tenderness. <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as a great natural force in a human frame.|$|R
60|$|I know he will. And I'm only {{prevented}} from saying all <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{and how much}} I love him, by the fear that he'll become perfectly unmanageable.|$|E
60|$|When <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> {{with his}} impenetrably wise face, {{walking up and}} down with the Doctor, delighted to be {{battered}} by the hard words in the Dictionary; when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> carrying huge watering-pots after Annie; kneeling down, in very paws of gloves, at patient microscopic work among the little leaves; expressing as no philosopher could have expressed, in everything he did, a delicate desire to be her friend; showering sympathy, trustfulness, and affection, out of every hole in the watering-pot; when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> never wandering in that better mind of his to which unhappiness addressed itself, never bringing the unfortunate King Charles into the garden, never wavering in his grateful service, never diverted from his knowledge that there was something wrong, or from his wish to set it right--I really feel almost ashamed of having known that he was not quite in his wits, taking account of the utmost I have done with mine.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah, you'll have to {{do without}} it!" [...] Oh, she was brisk now. [...] "And {{if you know what}} <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> you know no more than he does." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well,' he said, 'I hope I {{have done}} him no harm. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{now than when}} I came home. He looks {{to me as if}} the worst was over.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't believe Old Nick {{can be so}} very, ugly" [...] said Aunt Jamesina reflectively. [...] "He wouldn't do so much harm if he was. <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as {{a rather}} {{handsome}} gentleman." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Mr Broster. <b>I</b> always <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> as Reggie. He's one of Nature's Reggies. Such a kind, honest face. Well, as I was saying, Reggie {{discovered}} {{that it was time}} for lessons, and sent Ogden upstairs.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The one who {{had been}} mauled," [...] he {{answered}} readily, [...] "and I'll swear I saw him! The more <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him,</b> the more certain I am of him." ...|$|E
60|$|MURRAY (explosively). But him, especially--the dirty cad! Oh, I've got a rich notion {{to pay a}} call on that gentleman when I {{leave and}} tell him what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b>|$|E
6000|$|THE ORDERLY. Hooray! The Parkinsons of Stepney will {{be proud}} to have me call on them now. Ill go and tell the {{sergeant}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> Hooray! (He rushes out.) ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'No; <b>I</b> won't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> so,' said Stephen. 'If I {{appear before}} him some time hence {{as a man}} of {{established}} name, he will accept me--I know he will. He is not a wicked man.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'If you forgive, my poor boy! Nay, are {{not your}} very silence and {{forbearance}} signs of practical forgiveness? Besides, I have always observed that you have never used one of the epithets that <b>I</b> can't <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> without.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That is Hortensius," [...] said Trenchard; [...] "he will {{be called}} this term. They say he did nothing at the university, and is too idle to do {{anything}} at the bar; but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> highly <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> You should hear him in reply." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There is one person," [...] she exclaimed, [...] "who {{must have}} seen my poor child, and can doubtless tell what has become of her. Why did not <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> before? It is Phoebus." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "But I {{shall not}} marry {{a man for}} what others think of him, but for what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> myself. And in my view you cruelly malign him. I {{discover}} no such qualities in Sir Oliver." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I don't know, Gus. Of course, I'll let {{him know}} what <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> for spoiling my plans for a spread. But I hate to be hard on him, because of this disgrace about his uncle." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That Mr. Evan {{does not}} seem very anxious to claim our acquaintance, after all, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> <b>him</b> on that account. Has he spoken to you to-night, Dora?" [...] asked Mrs. Carroll, as Debby dropped down beside her after a [...] "splendid polka." ...|$|R
6000|$|DORA. I have {{no thought}} of marriage, my friend. We {{have been in}} such grief these five years, not only on my sister's account, but the ill success of the farm, and the debts, and my father's {{breaking}} down, and his blindness. How could <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> leaving <b>him?</b> ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{had better}} tell Miss Bertram to <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Rushworth. It may do her some good. <b>I</b> often <b>think</b> <b>of</b> Mr. Rushworth's {{property}} and independence, and wish them in other hands; but <b>I</b> never <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him.</b> A man might represent the county {{with such an}} estate; a man might escape a profession and represent the county." ...|$|R
60|$|MAN (shamefacedly, {{but still}} greatly tickled). I didn't laugh, I assure you. At least I didn't mean to. But when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{charging}} the windmills and {{thinking he was}} doing the finest thing--(chokes with suppressed laughter).|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is still}} the truth, Harriet, and my mind is lighter when <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> for that which made it so much heavier then.' He checked himself in his tone of melancholy, and smiled upon her as he said 'Good-bye!' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will not}} spare him. I am ashamed of him--thoroughly ashamed of him. What can <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> {{when he will}} lie there and not {{say a word to}} save his {{daughter}} from the machinations of a filthy Jew?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He {{must take}} it, mamma. He shall take it. If {{he can be}} stubborn, so can I. If {{he knows how to}} <b>think</b> <b>of</b> me more than himself, <b>I</b> can <b>think</b> <b>of</b> <b>him</b> and Edith more than of myself. That is not quite all, mamma. Then he wrote to me. There is his letter." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "What, that donkey, Evelyn, having cut you? I {{should not}} trouble myself much on that score, though <b>I</b> did <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> <b>him</b> at Eton." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Never!' said Laura. 'Oh, no; I {{could never}} dream {{of that with}} Guy. I like Guy very much; <b>I</b> <b>think</b> better <b>of</b> <b>him</b> than you do; but oh no; he could never be my first and best; I could never care for him in that way. How could you think so, Philip?' ...|$|R
