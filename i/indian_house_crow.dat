40|$|The <b>Indian</b> <b>House</b> <b>Crow</b> (Corvus splendens) is an Asiatic bird species, {{that was}} {{introduced}} to the coast of East Africa in the 1890 s (Lewis & Pomeroy, 1989). From Zanzibar, where colonial authorities introduced the species to act as an urban scavenger, the species has spread into coastal areas of Tanzania, Mozambique, South Africa, Kenya, Somalia and Ethiopia. After being recorded {{for the first time in}} Kenya in 1947 in Mombasa, this omnivorous scavenger is now very common in and around Mombasa city and island, and has spread along the north and south coast, and also expanded its distribution inland, largely following the main Mombasa-Nairobi road and rail links (Lewis & Pomeroy, 1989). Perhaps the best example that demonstrates the remarkable adaptive behaviour of this bird species to human environments, is that of the preferred use by the crows of metallic wire for nest building, instead of plant twigs and branches, as reported from large cities in India (Altevogt & Davis, 1979). In and around Mombasa, the breeding season is well defined, from September to January, with a marked peak in October (Brown & Britton, 1980). The success of the <b>Indian</b> <b>House</b> <b>Crow</b> is considered to be the cause of the decline of some other bird species in the coastal area around Mombasa, such as Pied Crow (Corvus albus), Speckled Mousebird (Colius striatus), Mornincr Thrush (Cichladusa arauata) and Golden PalmWeaver (Ploceus bojeri) (Lewis and Pomeroy, 1993). The species is also causing harassment to people at some of the hotels along the Kenyan coast, and reportedly may cause economy losses by inflicting damage to crops and poultry (Yousuf, 1982; Dhindsa et al., 1991). In addition, the species has been reported to be a possible carrier and transmitter of diseases such as cholera and dysenteria (Munguti, 1984; » Anonymous, 1995). In and around Mombasa, this crow has become a pest species, and attempts for its eradication and/or control l have been on-going since 1984. Control efforts have focused on the use of traps, poisoned bait, shooting of adult birds and destroying of nests, eggs and chicks. The problems caused by the crows at the coast have even lead to the formation of a House Crow Control Committee to coordinate the control and eradication programme. It is virtually impossible to monitor the success of control or eradication programmes without any basic data on the distribution and numbers of the crows. At present, no reliable data are available on the number of crows around Mombasa. As recommended in the minutes of the last House Crow Control Committee meeting, there is need for more research into the <b>Indian</b> <b>House</b> <b>Crow.</b> The aims of the present study were: (1) to count the total number of crows that roost on Mombasa island; (3) to assess which areas these crows mainly come from; (3) to study the group size and behavior at their arrival...|$|E

40|$|Through {{an earlier}} project, TCP/MDV/ 2307, FAO {{proposed}} measures to reduce rodent, bat and crow populations. However, to permit their application throughout the archipelago, the techniques {{needed to be}} refined in order to safeguard humans and domestic animals {{as well as to}} preserve indigenous species. The main purpose of this project was therefore to train Ministry of Agriculture (MOA) personnel in vertebrate pest management, and to provide guidelines for a management programmeStrategies were developed for the control of rats, giant fruit bats, <b>Indian</b> <b>house</b> <b>crows</b> and waterhens. Fourteen MOA field officers were trained in the various control techniques and an agricultural officer received overseas training in rodent control and laboratory proceduresThe most serious damage was caused by rats, which destroy an estimated 40 percent of the coconut crop. The project showed that crown baiting of coconuts with rodenticides can reduce rate damage substantially. However, the planned one-year programme of baiting at monthly intervals was not completed; such a programme must be sustained if it were to be effective. Rodent control programmes were implemented in the villages, and it was envisaged that these programmes could become self-supporting with the villagers purchasing the rodenticide at cost from the MOAThe project designed a simple trap for capturing waterhens which were found to be a sporadic pest in watermelon fields. It also demonstrated that fruit bats could be controlled satisfactorily by nettingThere appears to be little need to control <b>house</b> <b>crows,</b> but, if control measures were necessary, the chemical Alpha-Chlorolose should be used in preference to Monocrotophos which is more toxic to humans and chickens. A substantial quantity of Alpha-Chlorolose has been ordered for the MOANow that control techniques have been developed and MOA staff trained in their use, it was recommended that a large-scale programme of vertebrate pest control be implemented. The highest priority should be given to rodent control, with particular attention given to the promotion of rodent control by farmersIt was suggested that the MOA hire and train field officers who are from and wish to live on the various atolls.

40|$|The <b>Indian</b> <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> (Corvus splendens) has {{successfully}} invaded tropical and subtropical regions well beyond its native range, reaching pest proportions in many areas. The invasive population of house crows in Singapore (Southeast Asia) has increased at least 30 -fold since 1985 and now numbers {{in excess of}} 130, 000 birds. To understand the population ecology and behavior of the house crow in Singapore, we undertook regular population size and roost surveys, dissections of birds shot (to provide age structure and breeding status), detailed nestsite observations, and monitoring of coastal dispersal. Using a discrete-time, density-dependent population model to synthesize this information, we demonstrated that at least 41, 000 crows {{will need to be}} culled {{in the first year of}} a control program, and equivalent effort committed each year thereafter, to be confident of suppressing the Singapore population from its 2001 density of 190 birds/km(2) to the management target of < 10 birds/km(2) within a 10 -year period. This figure drops to 32, 000 if culling is combined with other management strategies such as resource limitation and nest destruction. Complete eradication of the house crow from Singapore may be an unrealistic goal due to potential difficulties in detecting crows at IOW population densities and influx of migrants from neighboring Malaysia. Our study has implications for pest-bird management in other cities in Asia, Africa, and the Middle East, and presents it surrogate population-dynamics management tool for use in regions where the house crow has become established as a pest species, but where limited local field data is available...|$|E
40|$|The <b>Indian</b> <b>house</b> <b>crow,</b> Corvus splendens (Vieillot) was {{introduced}} in Zanzibar, Tanzania by the British and immigrants from India in 1897 to help clean the town. The crow is responsible for polluting the environment, water sources and human surroundings by their droppings and the rubbish they carry. This behavior has led to concern that, the crows {{may be responsible for}} the spread of certain pathogens including Salmonella and their persistence in the environment. Given the zoonotic potential of Salmonella, the main aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the occurrence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella infections in Indian house crows and to determine if the isolates were similar to those associated with disease in livestock or humans. Methods: Indian house crows were lured with meat and blood baits to land into the crow live-trap set at the Mabibo compound of the National Institute for Medical Research (NIMR) in Dar es Salaam city in Tanzania. A total of 100 house crows were captured, humanely sacrificed, and their small and large intestines were obtained by using aseptic techniques for microbiological investigations. Culture technique was employed to detect the presence of Salmonella in intestinal contents; and preliminary identification of the isolates was based on colonial characteristics on selective media and microscopic examination of smears following Gram staining. Confirmation of Salmonella species was done by biochemical tests. Antimicrobial susceptibility testing was done by using the disc diffusion method on Mueller Hinton agar. Eight isolates were identified by standard microbiological techniques as Salmonella spp. (6 suggestive of Salmonella gallinarum and 2 suggestive of S. Typhi). All isolates were found to be susceptible to ciprofloxacin but resistant to amoxicillin. Lower levels of susceptibility were noted for chloramphenicol and ceftriaxone. Our results demonstrate the presence of antimicrobial resistant Salmonella spp. in the Indian house crows’ population and provide an indication of potential public and poultry health risks associated with these birds in the coastal area. The occurrence of antibiotic resistant S. Typhi and S. gallinarum among Indian house crows has both veterinary and public health consequences as they may be transmitted to poultry and humans. This therefore provides further rationale for the public action on eradicating the house crows...|$|E

40|$|<b>House</b> <b>crows</b> (Corvus splendens), {{normally}} {{known as}} pest organisms {{due to their}} unhygienic and noisy characteristics, are usually found in abundance in urban areas, particularly {{in areas that are}} littered with rubbish i. e. areas with poor waste management.

These areas provide abundant feeding opportunities for scavenging birds, in particular <b>house</b> <b>crows.</b> In Malaysia, hot spot areas for <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> nesting are in the Klang Valley, namely in Kuala Lumpur, Kajang and Klang which are in the Greater Kuala Lumpur area. The presence of <b>house</b> <b>crows</b> have often been regarded as unsustainable urban indicators, in particular as indicators of unhygienic conditions, which in turn are indicators of poor urban cleanliness and health.

We determined the population sizes and habitat-abundance relationships of the three most successful invasive bird species in Singapore: the <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> Corvus splendens, white-vented myna Acridotheres javanicus and common myna A. tristis. Estimated population sizes of the three species between February 2000 and February 2001 were between 106 000 - 176 000, 122 000 - 155 000 and 20 000 - 29 000, respectively. Population size of the <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> grew dramatically (> 30 -fold) in the last 15 - 16 y while that of the white-vented and common myna declined. Habitat-abundance relationships suggest that <b>house</b> <b>crows</b> are highly dependent on anthropogenic food. Their abundance was also positively related to proximity to coast.

40|$|The <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> (Corvus splendens) {{has reached}} pest {{proportions}} in Singapore and requires an integrated system of population control measures.

We compared the nest sites (n= 30) of the <b>house</b> <b>crow</b> with randomly selected sites (n= 30) to determine which environmental variables, if any, are indicative of preferred nest sites. The chi-squared test revealed the yellow flame tree (Peltophorum pterocarpum) to be the preferred tree species used for nesting. We formulated our model based on 11 preselected variables using binary logistic regression and evaluated the strength of support for each model (relative to all other models) using the second order model selection criterion AICc. The results indicate that <b>house</b> <b>crows</b> selected nests in areas that were more urbanised and open, with higher disturbance, nearer bin centres and food centres, and nested in trees that had larger crown volume, density and diameter. Based on these results, we suggest that urban managers can alter the landscape characteristics to make them less conducive for nesting crows. Such measures might include minor adjustments to the design of existing bin centres to prevent crows from entering, planting alternative, less suitable tree species in future, and regular pruning of trees with larger and denser crowns...|$|R
