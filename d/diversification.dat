5|$|The {{discovery}} of Vegavis, a late Cretaceous {{member of the}} Anatidae, proved that the <b>diversification</b> of modern birds started before the Cenozoic. The affinities of an earlier fossil, the possible galliform Austinornis lentus, dated to about 85 million years ago, are still too controversial to provide a fossil evidence of modern bird <b>diversification.</b>|$|E
40|$|We {{propose that}} the {{establishment}} of a host-country headquarters (HCHQ) in a large emerging market can be viewed as part of a multinational enterprise's (MNE) political strategy to facilitate its within-country <b>diversifications</b> by reducing institutional intervention of the host government. Using a sample of MNEs in China in the period 1979 – 2005, we find that MNEs with an HCHQ had a greater number of subsequent <b>diversifications</b> in China, as compared with those MNEs without an HCHQ. This effect was more prominent when the <b>diversifications</b> were in domains with a higher level of institutional intervention. ...|$|R
40|$|The Qinghai-Tibetan Plateau (QTP) is {{the highest}} {{and one of the}} most {{extensive}} plateaus in the world. Phylogenetic, phylogeographic and ecological studies support plant <b>diversifications</b> on the QTP through multiple mechanisms such as allopatric speciation via geographic isolation, climatic oscillations and divergences, pollinator-mediated isolation, diploid hybridization and introgression, and allopolyploidy. These mechanisms have driven spectacular radiations and/or species <b>diversifications</b> in various groups of plants such as Pedicularis L., Saussurea DC., Rhododendron L., Primula L., Meconopsis Vig., Rhodiola L., and many lineages of gymnosperms. Nevertheless, much work is needed toward understanding the evolutionary mechanisms of plant <b>diversifications</b> on the QTP. Well-sampled biogeographic analyses of the QTP plants in the broad framework of the Northern Hemisphere as well as the Southern Hemisphere are still relatively few and should be encouraged in the next decade. This paper reviews recent evidence from phylogenetic and biogeographic studies in plants, in the context of rapid radiations, mechanisms of species <b>diversifications</b> on the QTP, and the biogeographic significance of the QTP in the broader context of both the Northern and Southern Hemisphere biogeography. Integrative multidimensional analyses of phylogeny, morphological innovations, geography, ecology, development, species interactions and <b>diversifications,</b> and geology are needed and should shed insights into the patterns of evolutionary assembly and radiations in this fascinating region...|$|R

5|$|The Cretaceous period saw the {{appearance}} of more plant defense mechanisms. The <b>diversification</b> of flowering plants (angiosperms) at that time {{is associated with the}} sudden burst of speciation in insects. This <b>diversification</b> of insects represented a major selective force in plant evolution, and led to selection of plants that had defensive adaptations. Early insect herbivores were mandibulate and bit or chewed vegetation; but the evolution of vascular plants lead to the co-evolution of other forms of herbivory, such as sap-sucking, leaf mining, gall forming and nectar-feeding.|$|E
5|$|The {{profitability}} {{of the agricultural}} sector attracted foreign capital for railways and industries. British capital investments went from just over £20 million in 1880 to £157 million in 1890. During the 1880s, investment began to show some <b>diversification</b> as capital began to flow from other countries such as France, Germany and Belgium, though British investment still accounted for two thirds of total foreign capital. In 1890 Argentina was the destination of choice for British investment in Latin America, a position it held until World War I. By then, Argentina had absorbed between 40% and 50% of all British investment outside the United Kingdom. Despite its dependence on the British market, Argentina managed a 6.7% annual {{rate of growth of}} exports between 1870 and 1890 as a result of successful geographic and commodity <b>diversification.</b>|$|E

5|$|As {{a result}} of the <b>diversification</b> in markets and products, Argentina managed to escape the trap of a single-staple economy and {{sustained}} its economic growth over six decades. The combined effect of declining prices of textiles and rising prices of livestock products produced dramatic improvements in the terms of trade, which rose 377% between 1810 and 1825 in local prices. Several governors waged campaigns against the natives to increase the available lands, from Juan Manuel de Rosas to Julio Argentino Roca.|$|E

40|$|This {{dissertation}} {{examines the}} factors, at corporate, environmental and venture levels, that drive parent corporations {{to engage in}} corporate venture capital programs and to pursue CVC <b>diversifications.</b> This research contributes to an empirical validation of which large companies set up CVC programs {{at the global level}} and why. It contributes to the literature by providing an empirical support to the positive impact of innovative, entrepreneurial and “regulatory-friendly” local environments on parent corporations’ propensity to engage in CVC activities. Moreover, this thesis investigates and documents several factors which are pertaining to the parent companies, in particular, the corporate overall returns, the corporate financial resources and managerial stability, the local entrepreneurial and innovative environments in which they operate, as determinant for CVC <b>diversifications.</b> (IAG 3) [...] UCL, 201...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis Evolutionary <b>diversifications</b> are {{commonly}} {{attributed to the}} continued modifications of a conserved genetic toolkit of developmental pathways, such that complexity and convergence in organismal forms {{are assumed to be}} due to similarity in genetic mechanisms or environmental conditions. This approach, however, confounds the causes of organismal development with the causes of organismal differences and, as such, has only limited utility for addressing the cause of evolutionary change. Molecular mechanisms that are closely involved in both developmental response to environmental signals and major evolutionary innovations and <b>diversifications</b> are uniquely suited to bridge this gap by connecting explicitly the causes of within-generation variation with the causes of divergence of taxa. Developmental pathways of bone formation and a common role for bone morphogenetic proteins (BMPs) in both epigenetic bone remodeling and the evolution of major adaptive <b>diversifications</b> provide such opportunity. We show that variation in timing of ossification can result in similar phenotypic patterns through epigenetically induced changes in gene expression and propose that both genetic accommodation of environmentally induced developmental pathways and flexibility in development across environments evolve through heterochronic shifts in bone maturation relative to exposure to unpredictable environments. We suggest that such heterochronic shifts in ossification can not only buffer development under fluctuating environments while maintaining epigenetic sensitivity critical for normal skeletal formation, but also enable epigenetically induced gene expression to generate specialized morphological adaptations. We review studies o...|$|R

5|$|Megalodon faced {{a highly}} {{competitive}} environment. However, its position {{at the top of}} the food chain probably had a profound impact on the structuring of marine communities. Fossil evidence indicates a correlation between megalodon and the emergence and <b>diversification</b> of cetaceans and other marine mammals. Juvenile megalodon preferred habitats where small cetaceans were abundant, and adult megalodon preferred habitats where large cetaceans were abundant. Such preferences may have developed shortly after they appeared in the Oligocene.|$|E
40|$|Abstract. In this paper, {{we present}} a generic local search {{algorithm}} which artificially adds neutrality in search landscapes by discretizing the evaluation function.
