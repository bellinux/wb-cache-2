25|$|This {{description}} is simplified. Sub-regions {{such as the}} Iberian Peninsula and the Italian Peninsula contain their own complex features, as does mainland Central Europe itself, where the relief contains many plateaus, river valleys and basins that complicate the general trend. Sub-regions like Iceland, Britain, and Ireland are special cases.

This is divided up along the straths (river valleys) by more fertile farm and croft land.|$|E

This region is an area with great water potential, but also subject to irreversible damage from soil loss and the alteration of the water cycle.|$|E
