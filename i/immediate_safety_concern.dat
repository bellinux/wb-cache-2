" The Bulletin {{requested}} {{information regarding}} the structural integrity of the reactor pressure vessel head penetration (VHP) nozzles, inspections and repairs that have or will be completed to satisfy applicable regulatory requirements, and the basis for concluding that plans for future inspections will ensure compliance with applicable regulatory requirements. Entergy Operations, Inc. (Entergy) recognizes the need to identify and correct any concerns with potential leakage through the reactor coolant pressure boundary to prevent long-term safety concerns and overall weakening of the boundary itself. Entergy is committed to ensuring the safe operation of all of its units and therefore will provide the appropriate level of attention and oversight to the issue. To date, Entergy has expended significant resources in researching the existing condition of the Arkansas Nuclear One, Unit 1 (ANO- 1) control rod drive mechanism penetration nozzles which includes evaluating the structural acceptability of worst case expected flaws in these penetrations for ensuring safety.

40|$|Operations, {{and other}} members of your staff. The {{inspection}} examined activities conducted under your license as they relate to safety and compliance with the Commission’s rules and regulations and with the conditions of your license. The inspectors reviewed selected procedures and records, observed activities, and interviewed personnel. As described in Section 1 R 19 of this report, the NRC concluded that the failure to establish adequate procedural controls for the maintenance of electrical connections on diesel generators led to the failure of Diesel Generator 2 during testing on January 15, 2008. The safety significance of this finding was assessed {{on the basis of the}} best available information, including influential assumptions, using the applicable Significance Determination Process and was preliminarily determined to be a White (low to moderate safety significance) finding. Attachment 2 of this report provides a detailed description of the preliminary risk assessment. In accordance with NRC Inspection Manual Chapter 0609, “Significance Determination Process, ” we intend to complete our evaluation using the best available information and issue our final determination of safety significance within 90 days of this letter. This finding does not represent an <b>immediate</b> <b>safety</b> <b>concern</b> because of the corrective actions you have taken. These actions included applying thread locking compound to the amphenol connections on both diesel generators. Also, this finding constitutes an apparent violation of NRC requirements and is being considered for escalated enforcement action in accordance with the NRC Enforcement Policy.

40|$|When a {{power grid}} is overloaded, load {{shedding}} is a con-ventional way {{to combat the}} imbalance between supply and demand that may jeopardize the grid’s safety. How-ever, disconnected customers may be excessively incon-venienced or even endangered. With the emergence of demand-response based on cyber-enabled smart meters and appliances, customers may participate in solving the imbalance by curtailing their demands collabora-tively, such that no single customers will have to bear a disproportionate burden of reduced usage. However, compliance or commitment to curtailment requests by untrusted users is uncertain, which causes an important <b>safety</b> <b>concern.</b> This paper proposes a two-phase load management scheme that (i) gives customers a chance to curtail their demands and correct a grid’s undersupply {{when there are no}} <b>immediate</b> <b>safety</b> <b>concerns,</b> but (ii) falls back to conventional load shedding to ensure safety once the grid enters a vulnerable state. Extensive sim-ulations based on a 37 -bus electrical grid and traces of real electrical load demonstrate the effectiveness of this scheme. In particular, if customers are, as expected, suf-ficiently committed to the load curtailment, overloads can be resolved in real time by collaborative and grace-ful usage degradation among them, thereby avoiding un-pleasant blackouts in existing practice...|$|R
40|$|Despite {{increased}} awareness of domestic violence (DV), {{little is known about}} residents' preparedness to diagnose and respond appropriately to abuse victims. We designed a pilot study to examine this. Seventy-one internal medicine residents participated in a 10 -station standardized patient-based Clinical Skills Assessment. Forty (56 %) were male and 31 (44 %) were female; 46 (65 %) were PGY I; 63 (89 %) were trained internationally. One station presented a woman with headaches, whose underlying issue was DV. Forty (56 %) residents correctly diagnosed DV. Thirty referred the patient for DV counseling. Eighteen addressed <b>immediate</b> <b>safety</b> <b>concerns,</b> and 23 asked about child abuse. Forty-eight (68 %) made 1 or more incorrect recommendations. Thirty-six (51 %) ordered unnecessary tests. Residents who did not diagnose DV spent nearly twice as much per patient on work-up (mean, $ 942. 00), compared to those who diagnosed DV (mean, $ 421. 00). Use of certain interviewing skills appeared to promote elicitation of DV. Assessment-driven educational interventions could help trainees improve their recognition of DV and make appropriate and cost-effective management choices...|$|R
40|$|Following {{the decline}} of the coal mining sector {{in the latter half of}} the 20 th Century, efforts at {{regeneration}} in the South Welsh Valleys have often lacked a holistic perspective: initially focusing on <b>immediate</b> <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> and environmental aesthetics, but in separation from socioeconomic policies and initiatives. However, amid the growing integration of social, economic and environmental interventions, the Valleys Regional Park (VRP) has explicitly aimed to promote socioeconomic regeneration through the specific investment in a high-quality network of green spaces and post industrial heritage assets. Through a holistic partnership approach, the VRP seeks to develop the green economy, encourage healthy lifestyles, offer outstanding outdoor recreation and learning opportunities and provide a quality visitor destination, thereby changing perceptions of the region and making the Valleys a prime location to live, work and visit. As such the VRP is a flagship component of the Welsh Government’s sustainable development programme (Welsh Government 2012 a; 2012 b, p. 20) and a key focus of regeneration activity. The VRP covers the former South Wales coalfield stretching from the western borders of Monmouthshire in the East, to the former anthracite-mining valleys of Carmarthenshire in the West. It spans an area of over 200, 000 hectares and is home to over 1 million people, roughly one-third of the Welsh population...|$|R
40|$|Over {{the past}} decade, exports {{of fish and}} fishery {{products}} from developing countries have increased rapidly. However, {{one of the major}} challenges facing developing countries in seeking to maintain and expand their share of global markets is stricter food safety requirements in industrialized countries. Kenyan exports of Nile perch to the European Union provide a notable example of efforts to comply with such requirements, overlaid with the necessity to overcome restrictions on trade relating to <b>immediate</b> food <b>safety</b> <b>concerns.</b> Although food <b>safety</b> requirements were evolving in their major markets, most notably the European Union, most Kenyan exporters had made little attempts to upgrade their hygiene standards. Likewise, the legislative framework of food safety controls and facilities at landing sites remained largely unchanged. Both exporters and the Kenyan government were forced to take action when a series of restrictions were applied to exports by the European Union over the period 1997 to 2000. Processors responded by upgrading their hygiene controls, although a number of facilities closed, reflecting significant costs of compliance within the context of excess capacity in the sector. Remaining facilities upgraded their hygiene controls and made efforts to diversify their export base away from the European. Legislation and control mechanisms were also enhanced. Hygiene facilities at landin...|$|R
40|$|The {{outbreaks}} {{caused by}} enterohemorrhagic Escherichia coli O 157 :H 7 on leafy greens have raised serious and <b>immediate</b> food <b>safety</b> <b>concerns.</b> It {{has been suggested}} that several phytopathogens aid in the persistence and proliferation of the human enteropathogens in the phyllosphere. In this work, we examined the influence of virulence mechanisms of Dickeya dadantii 3937, a broad-host-range phytopathogen, on the proliferation of the human pathogen E. coli O 157 :H 7 EDL 933 (EDL 933) on postharvest lettuce by coinoculation of EDL 933 with D. dadantii 3937 derivatives that have mutations in virulence-related genes. A type II secretion system (T 2 SS) -deficient mutant of D. dadantii 3937, A 1919 (ΔoutC), lost the capability to promote the multiplication of EDL 933, whereas Ech 159 (ΔrpoS), a stress-responsive σ factor RpoS-deficient mutant, increased EDL 933 proliferation on lettuce leaves. A spectrophotometric enzyme activity assay revealed that A 1919 (ΔoutC) was completely deficient in the secretion of pectate lyases (Pels), which {{play a major role in}} plant tissue maceration. In contrast to A 1919 (ΔoutC), Ech 159 (ΔrpoS) showed more than 2 -fold-greater Pel activity than the wild-type D. dadantii 3937. Increased expression of pelD (encodes an endo-pectate lyase) was observed in Ech 159 (ΔrpoS) in planta. These results suggest that the pectinolytic activity of D. dadantii 3937 is the dominant determinant of enhanced EDL 933 proliferation on the lettuce leaves. In addition, RpoS, the general stress response σ factor involved in cell survival in suboptimal conditions, plays a role in EDL 933 proliferation by controlling the production of pectate lyases in D. dadantii 3937...|$|R
40|$|Very little {{research}} has focused on men or prisoners as victims of sexual violence. This study provides the first population-based analysis of factors associated with sexual coercion of men in Australian prisons, and the first to use a computer-assisted telephone interview to collect this information in a prison setting. A random sample of men in New South Wales and Queensland prisons were surveyed using computer-assisted telephone interviewing. We asked participants about sexual coercion, defined as being forced or frightened into doing something sexually that was unwanted while in prison. Associations between sexual coercion in prison and sociodemographics, sexual coercion history outside of prison, and prison-related factors were examined. Logistic regression was used to estimate adjusted odds ratios in examining factors associated with sexual coercion in prisons. Of 2626 eligible men, 2000 participated. Participants identifying as non-heterosexual and those with a history of sexual coercion outside prison were found to be most at risk. Those in prison {{for the first time and}} those who had spent more than 5 years in prison ever were also more likely to report sexual coercion. Although prison policies and improving prison officer training may help address <b>immediate</b> <b>safety</b> and health <b>concerns</b> of those at risk, given the sensitivity of the issue and likely under-reporting to correctional staff, community-based organizations and prisoner peer-based groups arguably have a role too in providing both preventive and trauma-focused support...|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{there has}} been {{substantial}} move towards architecture-based development for safety-critical software applications. Nevertheless, techniques for architectural design have not been developed {{to the extent necessary}} to guarantee the safety of these systems. In particular, current practices often focus upon architectural modelling without making the underlying design deliberation explicit. Although a number of protection mechanisms have been codified in both research and practice, there is little practical guidance mi how to exploit them to address application-specific <b>safety</b> <b>concerns.</b> This thesis defines and demonstrates a coherent and effective approach to eliciting and formulating <b>safety</b> <b>concerns,</b> evaluating and mitigating <b>safety</b> <b>concerns,</b> and arguing about safety within the evolutionary architecting process. The elicitation and formulation of <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> are based upon the unification of goals and scenarios from both positive. and negative perspectives. The evaluation of <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> is based upon the application of Object-Oriented Bayesian Belief Networks and mitigation space is informed by the evaluation results and the formulation of <b>safety</b> <b>concerns.</b> <b>Safety</b> argumentation of architectures is based upon the definition of a set of patterns of argument.

Through addressing <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> in the early system development lifecyc 1 e, there can be an increased level of design confidence in the architectures developed for safety-critical software applications.

However, {{little is known about}} the best method for collecting information from patients about <b>safety</b> <b>concerns.</b> This study presents an exploratory pilot of three mechanisms for collecting data on <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> from patients during their hospital stay. Three mechanisms for capturing <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> were coproduced with healthcare professionals and patients, before being tested in an exploratory trial using cluster randomisation at the ward level. Nine wards participated, with each mechanism being tested over a 3 -month study period. Patients were asked to feed back <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> via the mechanism on their ward (interviewing at their bedside, paper-based form or patient <b>safety</b> 'hotline'). <b>Safety</b> <b>concerns</b> were subjected to a two-stage review process to identify those that would meet the definition of a patient safety incident. Differences between mechanisms on a range of outcomes were analysed using inferential statistics. <b>Safety</b> <b>concerns</b> were thematically analysed to develop reporting categories. 178 patients were recruited. Patients in the face-to-face interviewing condition provided significantly more <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> per patient (1. 91) compared with the paper-based form (0. 92) and the patient safety hotline (0. 43). They were also significantly more likely to report one or more concerns, with 64 % reporting via the face-to-face mechanism, compared with 41 % via the paper-based form and 19 % via the patient safety hotline. No mechanism differed significantly in the number of classified patient safety incidents or physician-rated preventability and severity. Interviewing at the patient's bedside is likely to be the most effective means of gathering <b>safety</b> <b>concerns</b> from inpatients, potentially providing an opportunity for health services to gather patient feedback about safety from their perspective...|$|R
