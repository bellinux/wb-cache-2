5|$|When both {{rates of}} {{movement}} are known, the space {{velocity of the}} star relative to the Sun or the galaxy can be computed. Among nearby stars, {{it has been found}} that younger population I stars have generally lower velocities than older, population II stars. The latter have elliptical orbits that are inclined to the plane of the galaxy. A comparison of the <b>kinematics</b> of nearby stars has allowed astronomers to trace their origin to common points in giant molecular clouds, and are referred to as stellar associations.|$|E
5|$|In 1589, he was {{appointed}} to the chair of mathematics in Pisa. In 1591, his father died, and he was entrusted with the care of his younger brother Michelagnolo. In 1592, he moved to the University of Padua where he taught geometry, mechanics, and astronomy until 1610. During this period, Galileo made significant discoveries in both pure fundamental science (for example, <b>kinematics</b> of motion and astronomy) as well as practical applied science (for example, strength of materials and pioneering the telescope). His multiple interests included the study of astrology, which at the time was a discipline tied to the studies of mathematics and astronomy.|$|E
25|$|In physics one {{separates}} {{the laws of}} motion, called <b>kinematics,</b> from the laws of force, called dynamics. Following the classical <b>kinematics</b> of Newton's laws of motion, the <b>kinematics</b> of quantum mechanics is built {{in such a way}} that it presupposes nothing about the time reversal symmetry of the dynamics. In other words, if the dynamics are invariant, then the <b>kinematics</b> will allow it to remain invariant; if the dynamics is not, then the <b>kinematics</b> will also show this. The structure of the quantum laws of motion are richer, and we examine these next.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kinematics</b> – {{the actual}} {{arrangement}} of rigid members and joints in the robot, which determines the robot's possible motions. Classes of robot <b>kinematics</b> include articulated, cartesian, parallel and SCARA.|$|E
25|$|The <b>kinematics</b> of a {{complete}} spinal motion segment, when one of its constituent spinal joints is manipulated, are much {{more complex than the}} <b>kinematics</b> that occur during manipulation of an independent peripheral synovial joint.|$|E
25|$|Rotational or angular <b>kinematics</b> is the {{description}} of the rotation of an object. The description of rotation requires some method for describing orientation. Common descriptions include Euler angles and the <b>kinematics</b> of turns induced by algebraic products.|$|E
25|$|The {{study of}} motion {{can be divided}} into <b>kinematics</b> and dynamics. Direct <b>kinematics</b> refers to the {{calculation}} of end effector position, orientation, velocity, and acceleration when the corresponding joint values are known. Inverse <b>kinematics</b> refers to the opposite case in which required joint values are calculated for given end effector values, as done in path planning. Some special aspects of <b>kinematics</b> include handling of redundancy (different possibilities of performing the same movement), collision avoidance, and singularity avoidance. Once all relevant positions, velocities, and accelerations have been calculated using <b>kinematics,</b> methods from the field of dynamics are used to study the effect of forces upon these movements. Direct dynamics refers to the calculation of accelerations in the robot once the applied forces are known. Direct dynamics is used in computer simulations of the robot. Inverse dynamics refers to the calculation of the actuator forces necessary to create a prescribed end-effector acceleration. This information can be used to improve the control algorithms of a robot.|$|E
25|$|<b>Kinematics</b> {{is used in}} {{astrophysics}} {{to describe}} the motion of celestial bodies and collections of such bodies. In mechanical engineering, robotics, and biomechanics <b>kinematics</b> is {{used to describe the}} motion of systems composed of joined parts (multi-link systems) such as an engine, a robotic arm or the human skeleton.|$|E

25|$|Fluoroscopy allows {{real-time}} X-ray video, for precise <b>kinematics</b> {{of moving}} bones. Markers opaque to X-rays can allow simultaneous tracking of muscle length.|$|E
25|$|Classical <b>kinematics</b> {{does not}} {{primarily}} demand experimental description of its phenomena. It allows completely precise description of an instantaneous state by a value in phase space, the Cartesian product of configuration and momentum spaces. This description simply assumes or imagines a {{state as a}} physically existing entity without concern about its experimental measurability. Such a description of an initial condition, together with Newton's laws of motion, allows a precise deterministic and causal prediction of a final condition, with a definite trajectory of passage. Hamiltonian dynamics {{can be used for}} this. Classical <b>kinematics</b> also allows the description of a process analogous to the initial and final condition description used by quantum mechanics. Lagrangian mechanics applies to this. For processes that need account to be taken of actions of a small number of Planck constants, classical <b>kinematics</b> is not adequate; quantum mechanics is needed.|$|E
25|$|Dynamics {{the study}} of how forces affect moving bodies. Dynamics {{includes}} <b>kinematics</b> (about movement, velocity, and acceleration) and kinetics (about forces and resulting accelerations).|$|E
25|$|These {{methods can}} be combined. For example, studies {{frequently}} combine EMG and <b>kinematics</b> to determine motor pattern, {{the series of}} electrical and kinematic events that produce a given movement.|$|E
25|$|Stokes' wave {{theory is}} of direct {{practical}} use for waves on intermediate and deep water. It {{is used in}} the design of coastal and offshore structures, {{in order to determine the}} wave <b>kinematics</b> (free surface elevation and flow velocities). The wave <b>kinematics</b> are subsequently needed in the design process to determine the wave loads on a structure. For long waves (as compared to depth) – and using only a few terms in the Stokes expansion – its applicability is limited to waves of small amplitude. In such shallow water, a cnoidal wave theory often provides better periodic-wave approximations.|$|E
25|$|Airy wave {{theory is}} often applied in ocean {{engineering}} and coastal engineering for the modelling of random sea states – giving {{a description of}} the wave <b>kinematics</b> and dynamics of high-enough accuracy for many purposes.|$|E
25|$|In 2004, Prakash Panangaden {{described}} how {{to capture the}} <b>kinematics</b> of quantum causal evolution using System BV, a deep inference logic originally developed for use in structural proof theory. Alessio Guglielmi, Lutz Straßburger, and Richard Blute have also done work in this area.|$|E
25|$|Astrometry is {{the branch}} of {{astronomy}} that involves precise measurements of the positions and movements of stars and other celestial bodies.

25|$|Studying the <b>kinematics</b> of {{pairs of}} {{particles}} {{produced by the}} decay of a parent, such as the Z boson decaying {{to a pair of}} electrons or the Higgs boson decaying to a pair of tau leptons or photons, to determine various properties and mass of the parent.|$|E
25|$|Inverse {{dynamics}} is {{an inverse}} problem. It commonly refers to either inverse rigid body dynamics or inverse structural dynamics. Inverse rigid-body dynamics {{is a method}} for computing forces and/or moments of force (torques) based on the <b>kinematics</b> (motion) of a body and the body's inertial properties (mass and moment of inertia). Typically it uses link-segment models to represent the mechanical behaviour of interconnected segments, such as the limbs of humans, animals or robots, where given the <b>kinematics</b> of the various parts, inverse dynamics derives the minimum forces and moments responsible for the individual movements. In practice, inverse dynamics computes these internal moments and forces from measurements of the motion of limbs and external forces such as ground reaction forces, under a special set of assumptions.|$|E
25|$|The {{understanding}} of the <b>kinematics</b> of how exactly {{the rotation of the}} Earth affects airflow was partial at first. Late in the 19th century, {{the full extent of the}} large scale interaction of pressure gradient force and deflecting force that in the end causes air masses to move 'along' isobars was understood.|$|E
25|$|Important {{formulas}} in <b>kinematics</b> {{define the}} velocity and acceleration of {{points in a}} moving body as they trace trajectories in three-dimensional space. This is particularly important for the center of mass of a body, {{which is used to}} derive equations of motion using either Newton's second law or Lagrange's equations.|$|E
25|$|Over {{the period}} 1855 to 1867, Thomson collaborated with Peter Guthrie Tait on a text book that founded {{the study of}} {{mechanics}} first on the mathematics of <b>kinematics,</b> the description of motion without regard to force. The text developed dynamics in various areas but with constant attention to energy as a unifying principle.|$|E
25|$|Einstein's {{theory of}} special {{relativity}} (1905), {{which was based}} on <b>kinematics</b> and a careful examination of the meaning of measurement, was the first to completely explain the experimental difficulties associated with measurements of light. It represented not merely a theory of electrodynamics, but a fundamental re-conception of the nature of space and time.|$|E
25|$|There are {{two main}} {{descriptions}} of motion: dynamics and <b>kinematics.</b> Dynamics is general, since momenta, forces and energy of the particles are taken into account. In this instance, sometimes the term refers to the differential equations that the system satisfies (e.g., Newton's second law or Euler–Lagrange equations), and sometimes to the solutions to those equations.|$|E
25|$|Sonomicrometry {{employs a}} pair of {{piezoelectric}} crystals implanted in a muscle or tendon to continuously measure {{the length of a}} muscle or tendon. This is useful because surface <b>kinematics</b> may be inaccurate due to skin movement. Similarly, if an elastic tendon is in series with the muscle, the muscle length may not be accurately reflected by the joint angle.|$|E
25|$|It is {{important}} to observe that the huge body of work involving <b>kinematics,</b> dynamics and the mathematical models of the universe developed in baby steps – faltering, getting up and correcting itself – over three millennia and included contributions of both known names {{and others who have}} since faded from the annals of history.|$|E
25|$|Force {{plates are}} platforms, usually {{part of a}} trackway, {{that can be used}} to measure the {{magnitude}} and direction of forces of an animal's step. When used with <b>kinematics</b> and a sufficiently detailed model of anatomy, inverse dynamics solutions can determine the forces not just at the contact with the ground, but at each joint in the limb.|$|E
25|$|These allow {{products}} and components {{to be checked}} for flaws; assess fit and assembly; study ergonomics; and to analyze static and dynamic characteristics of systems such as stresses, temperatures, electromagnetic emissions, electrical currents and voltages, digital logic levels, fluid flows, and <b>kinematics.</b> Access and distribution of all this information is generally organized {{with the use of}} product data management software.|$|E
25|$|Robotics is the {{application}} of mechatronics to create robots, which are often used in industry to perform tasks that are dangerous, unpleasant, or repetitive. These robots may be of any shape and size, but all are preprogrammed and interact physically with the world. To create a robot, an engineer typically employs <b>kinematics</b> (to determine the robot's range of motion) and mechanics (to determine the stresses within the robot).|$|E
25|$|The leaf-spring {{suspension}} configuration is independent, {{because the}} movement of one wheel is not determined by {{the position of the}} other. Control arms are utilized to define the motion of the wheel as the suspension is compressed. The usual coil springs are replaced with a single FRP spring, which spans the width of the car. As in independent suspension systems using coil springs, and unlike the common leaf-spring supported Hotchkiss rear axle, the suspension <b>kinematics</b> are defined only by the control arms.|$|E
25|$|A {{special case}} of direct {{detection}} experiments covers those with directional sensitivity. This is a search strategy {{based on the}} motion of the Solar System around the Galactic Center. A low pressure time projection chamber makes it possible to access information on recoiling tracks and constrain WIMP-nucleus <b>kinematics.</b> WIMPs coming from the direction in which the Sun is travelling (roughly towards Cygnus) may then be separated from background, which should be isotropic. Directional dark matter experiments include DMTPC, DRIFT, Newage and MIMAC.|$|E
25|$|The {{morphology}} and <b>kinematics</b> of lenticular galaxies each, to a degree, {{suggest a}} mode of galaxy formation. Their disk-like, possibly dusty, appearance suggests they come from faded spiral galaxies, whose arm features disappeared. Alternatively, as lenticular galaxies {{are likely to be}} more luminous than spiral galaxies, which suggests that they are not merely the faded remnants of spiral galaxies. Rather, lenticular galaxies might result from galaxy merger, which increase the total stellar mass and give the newly merged galaxy its disk-like, arm-less appearance.|$|E
