The postal system established by the Mamluks, under the leadership of Baybars, was known as the Barīd, as it was during the period of Arab caliphate rule. The nephew of the chief secretary to Sultan Baybars attributed the Barids adoption and development by the Mamluks to the recommendations of his uncle, al-Sahib Sharaf al-Din Abu Muhammed Al-Wahab.

While the town was not a major center of music-making, as it lacked a local aristocratic court, it still had a substantial cathedral which <b>kept</b> an <b>up-to-date</b> repertory of polyphonic music. Fogliano was maestro di cappella at this institution during the period of its collection, and also during the time when Cardinal Giovanni Morone, one of the principal reformers of the Council of Trent, began the process of simplification of polyphony {{in order to make the}} text understandable to listeners.

As a result, cascading effects can have devastating consequences, while foreseeing the overall impact of a particular incident is not straight-forward at all and goes beyond performing a simple risk analysis.

His court wizard has <b>kept</b> him <b>up-to-date</b> on happenings in Venjipoor by scrying through a magic mirror, and the king's known enthusiasm for Conan has both fanned and inhibited his officers' machinations against the Cimmerian. Now Yildiz's partiality results in Conan being summoned back to Agraphur to be honored, but bureaucratic delays in the orders give the officers once last chance {{to try to get}} him killed. Again Conan and Juma's forces are sent deep into rebel territory, where gain they ambushed by numerically superior foes—but again they turn the tide and win clear.

50|$|Throughout its lifecycle, the GTD-5 EAX {{incorporated}} a quad-redundant processor architecture. The main processor complex of the APC, TPC, TCU, RLU, and RSU all {{consisted of a}} pair of processor cards, and each of those processor cards contained a pair of processors. The on-card pair of processors executed precisely the same sequence of instructions, and the output of the pair were compared each clock cycle. If the results were not identical, the processors were immediately reset, and the pair of processors on the other card were brought online as the active processor complex. The active processor always <b>kept</b> memory <b>up-to-date</b> so that when these forced switches occurred, little data loss was suffered. When the switch was requested as a part of routine maintenance, the switch could be accomplished with no data loss at all.|$|R

5000|$|Martha Allan {{hated to}} have the word 'amateur' applied to the MRT - [...] "amateur theatricals? I loathe them" [...] she once said. By the mid-1930s, she had almost succeeded in her aim of making the MRT professional, and in its standards, it largely was. Unlike its predecessor, The Community Players, the MRT had {{established}} a traditional subscription series of plays, an experimental studio wing, a French section, a school for theatre training, an extensive library collection of theatre books and memorabilia, and an organization magazine - Cue - that <b>kept</b> subscribers <b>up-to-date</b> {{with all kinds of}} theatrical information. Martha Allan was passionate about demanding the highest artistic standards at the MRT, and encouraged other local amateur groups to achieve the same level of artistic consistency. Moreover, the MRT was much more open than other significant Anglo-Montreal controlled institutions of the city, which were still firmly closed to French-Canadians, Jews and others. The MRT determined to produce plays in English, French and German, to make it accessible to all Montrealers, not just in the audience, but on the stage too.|$|R
50|$|The Nightdippers {{marked the}} end of an era when the last of their SH-3H Sea King {{helicopters}} was transferred from NAS Jacksonville in January 1995.

The squadron kept their vintage helicopters aloft for a total of 108,661 hours and in ready-to-launch, around-the-clock status for over three decades. The Sea Kings were flown to different parts of the country and one is displayed at the Quonset Point Air Museum in Rhode Island.|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the Solar America Initiative: Solar Outreach and Communications grant was to promote better {{communications}} among stakeholders; address infrastructure barriers to solar energy; and coordinate with industry, the U. S. Department of Energy, national laboratories, states, cities and counties. The Interstate Renewable Energy Council (IREC), a non-profit organization formed in 1982, approached this grant project by establishing {{a wide range of}} communication and outreach activities including newsletters, workshops, webinars, model practices and publications; by advancing easy and fair hook-up rules to the utility grid; and by upgrading training based on industry competency standards. The Connecting to the Grid project and the Solar Codes and Standards Public Hearings project offered communication coupled with technical assistance to overcome interconnection, net metering and other regulatory and program barriers. The Workforce Development Project tackled building a strong workforce through quality training and competency assessment programs. IRECÃÂ¢ÃÂÃÂs web site, the semi-monthly state and stakeholder newsletter and the metrics report resulted in better communications among stakeholders. Workshops and phone seminars offered technical assistance and <b>kept</b> stakeholders <b>up-to-date</b> on key issues.

The library was originally Newnham students' primary reference source since women were not allowed into the University Library.

40|$|Interface {{builders}} only {{support the}} construction of the menus and dialogue boxes of an application. They do not support {{the construction of}} interfaces of many application classes (visualization, simulation, command and control, domain-specific editors) because of the dynamic and complex information that these applications process. HUMANOID is a model-based interface design and construction tool where interfaces are specifkd by building a declarative description (model) of their presentation and behavior. HUMANOID’S modeling language provides simple abstraction, iteration and conditional constructs to model the interface features of these application classes. HUMANOID provides an easy-touse designer’s interface that lets designers build complex interfaces without programming. 4. by the user (specialized editors). Time varying data.
