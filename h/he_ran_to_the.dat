Secretary of Defense Rumsfeld insisted he remain at the Pentagon, and sent Deputy Secretary Paul Wolfowitz to Site R. The National Military Command Center (NMCC) continued to operate at the Pentagon, even as smoke entered the facility. Engineers and building managers manipulated the ventilation and other building systems that still functioned to draw smoke out of the NMCC and bring in fresh air.|$|E

2500|$|The plan did {{not work}} because the four policemen did not come out of Sherritt's house until the morning. This meant that {{the news of the}} murder did not reach Melbourne as quickly as the Kelly Gang had hoped. The people held {{prisoner}} in the hotel became restless.
