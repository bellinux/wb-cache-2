5|$|In the Harivansh Puraan, the Parijata, baobab tree, {{is called}} a Kalpavriksha, or wish bearing tree, which apart {{from the village of}} Kintoor, near Barabanki, Uttar Pradesh, is only found in heaven. The tree has mythological link with prince Arjuna of the Pandava clan who is said to have brought it <b>from</b> <b>heaven.</b> His mother Kunti after whom the village Kintoor is named used to offer flowers from this tree to worship Lord Shiva. It is also said that Lord Krishna brought this tree <b>from</b> <b>heaven</b> to please his wife Satyabhama.|$|E
5|$|Both {{the opening}} and ending credits {{sequences}} incorporate shots of St Michael and All Angels Church in Hughenden Valley, Buckinghamshire, which doubles as the parish church of Father Unwin. In the opening sequence, a zoom shot establishes a backdrop of fields while the series title slowly fills the screen, in a motion that draws inspiration from traditional images of angels descending <b>from</b> <b>Heaven.</b>|$|E

5|$|For Your Eyes Only {{marked a}} change in the {{production}} crew: John Glen was promoted from his duties as a film editor to director, a position he would occupy for the next four films. Since Ken Adam was busy with the film Pennies <b>from</b> <b>Heaven,</b> Peter Lamont, who had worked in the art department since Goldfinger, was promoted to production designer. Following a suggestion from Glen, Lamont created realistic sets, instead of the elaborate scenery for which the series had been known.|$|E
5|$|Geoffrey Chaucer's Troilus and Criseyde {{reflects}} a more humorous world-view than Boccaccio's poem. Chaucer {{does not have}} his own wounded love to display and therefore allows himself an ironic detachment from events and Criseyde is more sympathetically portrayed. In contrast to Boccaccio's final canto, which returns to the poet's own situation, Chaucer's palinode has Troilus looking down laughing <b>from</b> <b>heaven,</b> finally aware of the meaninglessness of earthly emotions. About {{a third of the}} lines of the Troilus are adapted from the much shorter Il Filostrato, leaving room for a more detailed and characterised narrative.|$|E
5|$|Mons. Minguel Placid Colaco {{wrote the}} devotional hymn Jezucho Mog (Jesus' Love) in 1905, and {{translated}} the Latin hymn Stabat Mater into Konkani {{under the title}} Khursa Mullim (Bottom of the Holy Cross). Joseph Saldanha's Shembor Cantigo (100 Hymns) and Raimundo Mascarenhas' Deva Daia Kakultichea (O Compassionate Master) were popular. Other popular Konkani hymns composed by Mangalorean Catholics are Aika Cristanv Jana (Listen, O' Christian People), Utha Utha Praniya (Wake up, Creatures), and Sorgim Thaun (<b>From</b> <b>Heaven).</b>|$|E

5|$|Nandanar {{entered the}} holy fire {{chanting}} {{the name of}} Shiva and reappeared in a new purified form. He looked like a Brahmin sage, wearing matted hair (characteristic of a Shaiva) and the sacred thread worn by Brahmins across his chest. His body was smeared with sacred ash. The gods showered flowers on the Nayanar <b>from</b> <b>heaven</b> and the Brahmins cheered. With the Brahmins, Nandanar went in the garbhagriha and saw Nataraja. The Nayanar disappeared {{in the image of}} Nataraja and became one with Shiva.|$|E
5|$|Nobles, {{who were}} {{believed}} to be direct descendants of the descended person <b>from</b> <b>heaven,</b> lived in tongkonans, while commoners lived in less lavish houses (bamboo shacks called banua). Slaves lived in small huts, which had to be built around their owner's tongkonan. Commoners might marry anyone, but nobles preferred to marry in-family to maintain their status. Sometimes nobles married Bugis or Makassarese nobles. Commoners and slaves were prohibited from having death feasts. Despite close kinship and status inheritance, there was some social mobility, as marriage or change in wealth could affect an individuals status. Wealth was counted by the ownership of water buffaloes.|$|E
5|$|The mosque has an old Quran, {{believed}} by the locals {{to have been}} given as a gift <b>from</b> <b>heaven</b> in 1650 to Yidan Barimah Bramah, the Imam at the time, {{as a result of}} his prayers. The mosque, built with mud and reeds, has two tall towers in pyramidal shape, one for the mihrab which faces towards Mecca forming the facade on the east and the other as a minaret in the northeast corner. These are buttressed by twelve bulbous shaped structures, which are fitted with timber elements.|$|E

50|$|Islam on {{the other}} hand has no rituals {{associated}} with fire and burning. Quran describes the devil as a creature of fire. The devil rejection and despise towards man originates from the devil perception that fire is superior to mud. This sentiment was the cause of the devil demise <b>from</b> <b>heavens.</b>|$|R
5|$|The oral {{legends and}} texts {{initiate}} {{a process of}} Sanskritization of the folk deity Khandoba by elevating him to the classical Hindu god Shiva; his two principal wives Mhalsa and Banai are equated to Parvati and Ganga. Banai {{does not appear in}} the Sanskrit Malhari Mahatmya, the main scripture related to Khandoba, however it mentions Ganga arriving <b>from</b> <b>heaven.</b> Banai (Ganga) has a quarrel with Mhalsa (Parvati), ultimately ending with the message that both are the same. Some Dhangars consider Banai also to be a form of Parvati.|$|E
5|$|The pediments are {{decorated}} with the figure of Narayana riding {{on the back of}} a garuda, this figure symbolizes kingship and the king's association with the Hindu deity. According to legend Narayana descended <b>from</b> <b>heaven</b> in human form to help mankind by alleviating them from suffering. Thus the deity represents all the ideal qualities in a king. The throne hall stands on a high base with convex and concave moldings. The bottom layer, according to Thai beliefs resembles a lion's foot, the lion is a symbol of the Buddha's family and alludes to the Buddha's own royal heritage.|$|E
5|$|After a {{short time}} in jail, they are {{released}} by a social worker named Gabriel, whom Homer mistakes for an angel sent <b>from</b> <b>Heaven.</b> Gabriel moves in with the family to help them be functional again. After observing the family's quirks, Gabriel takes the family to a forest and diagnoses the family's problems accordingly: Marge tries to prove her self-worth to the family by medicating them with food, Bart is addicted to doing crazy stunts for attention, and Homer is simply a drunken buffoon. Gabriel then sets up a challenge to teach the Simpsons the importance of teamwork by setting up a picnic basket in a tree. The object is for the family to work {{together as a team}} to get it down. After a harrowing rescue involving Bart driving the family car and Homer nearly becoming prey for wild predators, the Simpsons succeed and Gabriel congratulates them on working together as a family and becoming functional during their drive home.|$|E

In {{the first of these}} she played a 1970s pornographic actress, while the other three featured her as an unhappy, mid-20th century housewife. She also had success with the films The Big Lebowski (1998), Magnolia (1999), Hannibal (2001), Children of Men (2006), A Single Man (2009), The Kids Are All Right (2010), and Crazy, Stupid, Love (2011), and won several awards for her portrayal of Sarah Palin in the television film Game Change (2012).

5|$|The {{stone was}} venerated at the Kaaba in pre-Islamic pagan times. According to Islamic tradition, {{it was set}} intact into the Kaaba's wall by the prophet Muhammad in the year 605 AD, five years before his first revelation. Since then it has been broken {{into a number of}} {{fragments}} and is now cemented into a silver frame {{in the side of the}} Kaaba. Its physical appearance is that of a fragmented dark rock, polished smooth by the hands of pilgrims. Islamic tradition holds that it fell <b>from</b> <b>heaven</b> as a guide for Adam and Eve to build an altar. It has often been described as a meteorite, a hypothesis which is now uncertain.|$|E
5|$|Van der Weyden {{may have}} drawn {{influence}} from Stefan Lochner's c.1435 Last Judgement, {{and a similar}} c.1420 painting now in the Hotel de Ville, Diest, Belgium. Points of reference include Christ raised over a Great Deësis of saints, apostles and clergy above depictions of the entrance to Heaven and the gates of Hell. In both earlier works Christ perches on a rainbow; in the Deësis panel he also is above a globe. While these two earlier works are filled with dread and chaos, van der Weyden's panels display the same sorrowful, but self-controlled dignity of his best works. This is most evident {{in the manner in}} which the oversized and dispassionate Christ orchestrates the scene <b>from</b> <b>Heaven.</b>|$|E
5|$|Horses appear {{frequently}} in accounts concerning miraculous {{events in the}} context of Anglo-Saxon Christianity. In the 7th century, a horse is reported to have revealed warm bread and some meat when St Cuthbert was hungry, by pulling straw from the roof of a hut; and, when Cuthbert was suffering from a diseased knee, he was visited by an angel on horseback, who helped him to heal his knee. In the 8th century, the Anglo-Saxon Bishop Willibald of Eichstätt wrote that, when a source of fresh water was needed for a monastery on the site where St Boniface had died, in the kingdom of Frisia, the ground gave way under the forelegs of a horse, and, when the horse was pulled free, a fountain of spring water came out of the ground and formed a brook. In the 10th century, King Edmund I is reported to have been saved from death while chasing a deer on horseback when he prayed for forgiveness for his maltreatment of St Dunstan, and thereafter made him abbot of Glastonbury: the horse stopped {{at the edge of a}} cliff, over which the deer and hunting dogs had already fallen. On a later occasion, a horse fell dead under Dunstan when he heard a voice <b>from</b> <b>heaven</b> telling him that King Eadred had died.|$|E
