5|$|Leith {{remarked that}} {{recording}} {{the album was}} an exciting but nerve-racking experience. He recorded his music at Sony BMG's recording studio in East Sydney. His producers already had in mind what kind of album they want to produce for Leith. He, however wanted his album to be totally acoustic. Knowing that he was well known by the Australian public as the new Australian Idol, he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> risky to produce an acoustic based album because it {{was very different from}} the records produced by the previous Idol contestants, as many of their records predominantly featured up-beat pop songs. He noted that the music he was making could make the album harder to sell commercially.|$|E

5|$|By March, front-runner John McCain {{had secured}} enough pledged delegates to {{guarantee}} that he would win the nomination, and Romney and Huckabee had both formally withdrawn from the race. Paul, who had won no state primaries, <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> now mathematically {{impossible for him to}} win the nomination, as he had captured only 20– 40 pledged delegates compared to more than 1,191 for McCain, yet he refused to concede the race and said that it was unlikely that he would ultimately endorse McCain. Over the next few weeks, Paul's supporters clashed with establishment Republicans at several county and state party conventions over state party rules, the party platforms, and selection of delegates for the national convention. In one of the more dramatic moments, Nevada's state party leaders, outmaneuvered by Paul supporters at the state nominating convention, resorted to the highly unusual measure of prematurely and abruptly shutting down the convention before selecting national delegates, with a plan to reconvene at a later date.|$|E

25|$|Tension existed {{within the}} Cuban revolutionary {{committee}} between Martí and his military compatriots. Martí feared a military dictatorship would {{be established in}} Cuba upon independence, and suspected Dominican-born General Máximo Gómez of having these intentions. Martí knew that the independence of Cuba needed time and careful planning. Ultimately, Martí refused to cooperate with Máximo Gómez and Antonio Maceo Grajales, two Cuban military leaders from the Ten Years' War, when they wanted to invade immediately in 1884. Martí <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> too early to attempt to win back Cuba, and later events proved him right.|$|E
25|$|In late 1935, {{he turned}} to Frank C. Bennett, then President of Bennett Oil Corporation, President of Federal Oil of Houston, Texas, and Vice-President of Bennett Oil and Gas of Lake Charles, Louisiana. Merrill's choice of Bennett as an {{investor}} was no accident or stroke of luck, as he <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> common for oil companies {{to invest in the}} development of airplanes, and frequently sponsored flights and other events to highlight the performance of their products. After Merrill’s convincing presentation, Bennett joined Merrill in forming the Bennett Aircraft Corporation of Wilmington, Delaware. The aircraft was to be a twin-engine (called bimotored in the 1930s), eight-place mid-wing monoplane with a conventional tail unit and retractable landing gear. It was powered by two wing-mounted Jacobs L-6 engines. The passenger cabin for six passengers was behind the two-crew flight deck.|$|E

At {{the recommendation of the}} eunuch Yang Qinyi (楊欽義), whom Li Deyu had befriended while he was serving as the military governor of Huainan and Yang Qinyi served as the eunuch monitor of the Huainan army, Emperor Wuzong recalled Li Deyu to serve as chancellor and entrusted him with the affairs of the state. Yang Sifu and Li Jue were sent out of the capital, to serve as the governors of Hunan Circuit (湖南, headquartered in modern Changsha, Hunan) and Gui District (桂管, headquartered in modern Guilin, Guangxi), respectfully, while such associates as Pei Yizhi (裴夷直) and Li Zhongmin (李中敏) were also demoted.|$|E

25|$|As Grant's plan {{became clear}} to Lee on May 4, Lee <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> {{imperative}} {{to fight in the}} Wilderness for the same reason as the year before: his army was massively outnumbered, with approximately 65,000 men to Grant's 120,000, and his artillery's guns were fewer than and inferior to those of Grant's. Fighting in the tangled woods would eliminate Grant's advantage in artillery, and the close quarters and ensuing confusion there could give Lee's outnumbered force better odds. He therefore ordered his army to intercept the advancing Federals in the Wilderness. Ewell marched east on the Orange Court House Turnpike, reaching Robertson's Tavern, where they camped about 3–5 miles from the unsuspecting soldiers in Warren's corps. Hill used the Orange Plank Road and stopped at the hamlet of New Verdiersville. These two corps could pin the Union troops in place (they had been ordered to avoid a general engagement until the entire army could be united), fighting outnumbered for at least a day while Longstreet approached from the southwest for a blow against the enemy's flank, similar to Jackson's at Chancellorsville.|$|E

500|$|From 29 July to 11 August, the Austro-Hungarian army {{launched}} {{a series of}} artillery attacks in northern and northwestern Serbia and subsequently managed to exploit the bombardments by constructing a system of pontoon bridges across the Sava and Drina rivers.

Strong detachments were posted in the towns of Valjevo and Užice, and outposts were stationed at every important point on the frontier. At this stage, all the Serbian General Staff could do was wait until the Austro-Hungarian invasion plan materialized.|$|E

500|$|The hawthorn-scented bath lotion, or boyaryshnik, {{that caused}} the mass {{methanol}} poisoning was purchased as a drink because of its low price amid poor economic conditions—such liquids were {{not subject to the}} alcohol excise tax, which had been increased as part of an anti-alcohol effort in 2009, or other restrictions placed in recent years to help curb alcohol consumption in the country. Although the bottles are typically half the size of traditional vodka, their alcohol content is such that they can be diluted into a strength similar to vodka. Moreover, they were often available from vending machines at any time of the night, while government-regulated liquor could only be sold within legally defined hours. The machines were often deliberately placed near poorer areas of Russian cities, where the product would be appealing to those seeking a cheaper alternative to regular alcohol. [...] "Everybody <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> not bath oil," [...] one individual told The New York Times after the poisoning.

500|$|Pyramid Head {{makes an}} {{appearance}} in the 2006 film adaptation of Silent Hill as [...] "Red Pyramid", and is portrayed by Roberto Campanella. In the film, the psyches of the female characters shaped the character's physical appearance. Gans claimed that replicating the character's head exactly and having the actor move while wearing {{it proved to be}} impractical; he noted that, despite the name, Pyramid Head actually wore [...] "a basin" [...] instead of a triangle-shaped head. Red Pyramid's sword and head were constructed out of lightweight material painted to appear heavy. For the role, Campanella wore a [...] "five-part prosthetic"; it took two-and-a-half to three hours to get him into costume and make-up. His boots had a hidden [...] sole which made him just under [...] tall. Patrick Tatopoulos, who worked on the make-up effects and monsters, enjoyed the project of designing the character. According to him, Red Pyramid serves {{as a symbol of the}} town's darkness and harbinger of its changed character. Gans considered the monsters of the film [...] "a mockery of human beings", and commented: [...] "The real monsters are the people, the cultists who tortured Alessa. When I approached the film, I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> impossible to represent the monsters as simply beasts that jump on you." ...|$|E
500|$|Lindemann and Lütjens at {{this point}} {{differed}} {{on how best to}} continue the mission. Lindemann, as commander of a battleship, was guided by the tactical situation, and wanted to hunt down the damaged Prince of Wales. (The Germans did not at that time know the ship to be Prince of Wales, but <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a [...] battleship.) Lütjens, apparently mindful of the fleet order to avoid unnecessary contact with similar enemy units, rejected this without discussion. Lindemann and Lütjens also differed on where to take the ship for repairs; Lindemann advocated retracing their route through the Denmark Strait and returning to Bergen, Norway. Lütjens overruled him and ordered a course set for Saint-Nazaire, France. In the afternoon, Admiral Lütjens ordered Prinz Eugen to break away from Bismarck and operate independently against the enemy's merchant shipping. Prinz Eugen and Bismarck separated at 18:14 that evening. Prinz Eugen arrived safely at Brest, France on 1 June 1941. No direct witnesses to this difference of opinion survived the sinking, but Matrosengefreiter (Leading Seaman) Heinz Staat, the helmsman on the bridge, remembered a telephone call between the First Watch Officer, Commander Hans Oels, and a fleet staff officer which suggested that Lindemann had been trying to persuade Lütjens to pursue the enemy. A messenger returning to his comrades below spoke of [...] "dicke Luft" [...] ("thick air" [...] or a [...] "bad atmosphere") on the bridge.|$|E

500|$|As {{a former}} police officer, actor David Zayas was {{immediately}} interested {{in the role of}} Sgt. Angel Batista. After appearing in Oz for a season, Erik King, was looking for a [...] "different" [...] acting chance, he [...] "loved" [...] the character of Sgt. Doakes, after reading the script. South Korean actor C.S. Lee, who has a recurring role on the show as forensics specialist Vince Masuka, was asked for the part after Dexter producers recognized him in guest parts on Spin City, [...] and The Sopranos. Lee accepted the part because of the [...] "fantastic" [...] writing. By September 15, Jennifer Carpenter had joined the cast to play the part of Debra Morgan. Carpenter had enough time before her audition to read the Dexter books, but admitted that she [...] "didn’t exactly see myself in the books. I <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> going to be a TV show and that it had the potential to go for five to seven years, so I tried to make Deb as similar to me as possible and to bring out the parts of myself that were like Deb. I think that may have helped in the audition and it has certainly helped sustain such a long run with one character." [...] She also stated that she enjoyed cursing on television, but found it hard to stop it creeping into her real life. In June 2006 Geoff Pierson was cast as Cpt. Matthews.

500|$|One of Nick's {{most notable}} {{returns to the}} series {{occurred}} in 1990. Nick returned to his mother's life with the claim {{that he was a}} born-again Christian, which happened to coincide with her £1000 win on the bingo. EastEnders writer Sarah Phelps explained: [...] "For Dot, the idea that Jesus had finally spoken to Nick, that was all her Christmases coming at once! Nick <b>knew</b> <b>that.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> sort of obvious that Nick could be saying 'Jesus walks with me' and then just go out and kick somebody or nick their wallet." [...] With the help of a fake priest, Nick managed to convince his mother of his new-found faith and then began a slow campaign to control her eating habits and poison her in order to claim her money. Discussing the storyline, scriptwriter Colin Brake has indicated that at first it was not clear to the audience whether Nick had reformed or not, but as the weeks passed it became obvious that he did intend to kill his mother, as he was shown practising a fake suicide note in Dot's handwriting– a foil to cover the intended murder; according to Brake, Dot remained blithely and perhaps purposefully ignorant to his wrongdoing. The episode which culminated the storyline, written by P.J. Hammond, was set solely in Dot's house and featured an unusually small cast consisting of Nick, Dot, Nick's estranged father Charlie, Dot's close friend Ethel Skinner and Alistair the fake priest. At the last moment, in what Altman has called the [...] "one time we saw a glimmer of Nick’s good side", Nick backed out of his plan and stopped Dot from eating the poisoned meal he had intended to kill her with. Once again Dot was left alone, broken-hearted at what her own son had been prepared to do to her.|$|E

[...] He learned how to play piano from a how-to piano book he found in the piano bench. [...] One morning his father {{taught him how to}} play a boogie-woogie blues tune and by nightfall he could play the entire piece. [...] He started playing {{classical}} piano at age eight, taking lessons {{for a year and a}} half but was self-taught thereafter. [...] While in junior high, he took a concert field trip where he saw Buddy Rich perform. He recalls, [...] "I sat in the first row and when Buddy's sax player stood up to take his first solo something just clicked — the world closed in around me. I felt the power of music and <b>knew</b> <b>that</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> something special, a gift to be shared." [...] Joseph played piano for the jazz band and choir in high school, and trombone through high school and college. [...] When he picked up the horn, he got a whole new perspective on music, gaining insight into all the different timbres available, which was invaluable to him when he started working with orchestras. [...] The first band he was in was a wedding dance band which allowed him to gain experience in every different style of music from polkas to rock and roll to jazz classics. [...] After attending Moorhead State University as a music major, he led some of his own bands around the area that toured Midwest nightclubs. [...] He played sax and guitar in some of these earlier bands but left them to concentrate on just the piano/keyboards. Later, he started performing with guitarist Dugan McNeill, whose U2-like group was signed to Polygram. [...] McNeill and Yanni had once played together in the technopop band Chameleon in the late 1970s and early 1980s.|$|E
