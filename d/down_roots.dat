25|$|The German Palatinates {{who settled}} in Pennsylvania, erroneously {{known as the}} Pennsylvania Dutch, also left their homelands {{for a number of}} reasons. Politically they had been oppressed in the old country, and {{economically}} they were poor. They were also gravely persecuted for their religious beliefs. Like the Scotch-Irish, the Germans kept to themselves and did not interfere with settlers of other backgrounds. Throughout the parts of Pennsylvania that had already been settled, German was the prominently spoken language, surpassing English. This encouraged more German settlers to lay <b>down</b> <b>roots</b> in Pennsylvania more so than in the other colonies. Most of the German settlers were farmers, and they flourished in rural areas. These Germans saw farming as a way of life, and tended to be conservative, religious, frugal and hard working people. Unlike the Scotch-Irish, the Germans were not politically minded, and they had no qualms with the English governing them. A majority of the Germans did not leave Pennsylvania, but stayed to work the rich soil.|$|E
25|$|Broadcast 1 February 1995, {{this episode}} {{examines}} how plants either share environments harmoniously or compete for dominance within them. Attenborough highlights the 1987 storm and the devastation it caused. However, for some species, {{it was that}} opportunity for which they had lain dormant for many years. The space left by uprooted trees is soon filled by others who move relatively swiftly towards the light. The oak {{is one of the}} strongest and longest-lived, and other, lesser plants nearby must wait until the spring to flourish before the light above is extinguished by leaves. Tropical forests are green throughout the year, so brute force is needed for a successful climb {{to the top of the}} canopy: the rattan is an example that has the longest stem of any plant. As its name suggests, the strangler fig 'throttles' its host by growing around it and cutting off essential water and light. Some can take advantage of a fallen tree by setting <b>down</b> <b>roots</b> on the now horizontal trunk and getting nutriment from the surrounding moss and the fungi on the dead bark. The mountain ash (eucalyptus regnans) grows so tall, that regeneration becomes a considerable problem. It is easily flammable, so its solution is to shed its seeds during a forest fire and sacrifice itself. It therefore relies on the periodic near-destruction of its surroundings in order to survive. Attenborough observes that catastrophes such as fire and drought, while initially detrimental to wildlife, eventually allow for deserted habitats to be reborn.|$|E

500|$|The {{following}} year, {{however, the}} Red Roses' performance {{fell short of}} the previous season when it placed second, with 63 wins and 47 losses. [...] According to Spalding's Baseball Guide (1911), the Lancaster organization {{was one of several}} teams in the league caught off guard by a surprisingly strong new club from Altoona, Pennsylvania, which was [...] "sent along at a clip that practically clinched the season". While the Red Roses pulled out of a mid-season slump, the [...] "Altoonas" [...] prevailed with a 7238 record. In an article regarding this outcome, Sporting Life stated that [...] "nothing can be found to cast discredit upon the Lancaster team or its popular manager, Marty Hogan". [...] The paper added, [...] "With a team that never stood high in club hitting or fielding, Marty pulled them through and anchored them in second place, which position they attained more by dint of their cleverness in inside work than with their prowess with the stick or in the field". [...] In December 1910, {{a little more than two}} months after the article appeared, Hogan reportedly set <b>down</b> <b>roots</b> in Lancaster, opening a cigar shop and billiard hall in the city.

500|$|The {{first three}} volumes {{are set in}} the 1920s and follow the main {{characters}} through school, university and their first steps towards social and professional acceptance. The next three are placed in the 1930s; the protagonists become established, put <b>down</b> <b>roots,</b> watch the international situation anxiously and prepare for war. [...] The background for the seventh, eighth and ninth volumes is the Second World War, which not all the characters survive. The final three books cover the 25 years {{from the early days}} of the post-war Attlee government to the counterculture and protests of the early 1970s. During the long narrative, the focus changes frequently from one group to another; new faces appear while established characters are written out, sometimes reappearing after many volumes, sometimes not at all, though news of their doings may reach Jenkins, through one or other of his many acquaintances. Apart from Jenkins, Widmerpool is the only one of the 300-odd characters who takes part in the action of each of the 12 volumes. Richard Jones, writing in the Virginia Quarterly Review, suggests that the novels may be regarded as [...] "the dance of Kenneth Widmerpool, who is Jenkins's fall-guy, tormentor, and antithesis". Widmerpool dogs Jenkins's career and life; in the opening pages of the first book at school, he [...] is encountered running through the mists, in the vain hope of athletic glory. In the final stages of the last book he is running again, this time at the behest of the quasi-religious cult that has claimed him.|$|E

2500|$|Historian Neill Lochery {{asserts that}} Circular 14 “was not issued {{out of thin}} air” and {{that this type of}} barrier was not unique to Portugal and with the country’s very limited {{economic}} resources it was viewed as necessary. It was economic reasons rather than ideological reasons that made the Portuguese avoid accepting more refugees says Lochery. Milgram expressed similar views, asserting that Portugal’s regime did not distinguish between Jews and non-Jews but rather between immigrant Jews who came and had the means to leave the country and those lacking them. Portugal prevented Jews from putting <b>down</b> <b>roots</b> in the country not because they were Jews but because the regime feared foreign influence in general, and feared the entrance of Bolsheviks and left-wing agitators fleeing from Germany. Milgram believes that antisemitic ideological patterns had no hold in the ruling structure of the [...] "Estado Novo" [...] and a fortiori in the various strata of Portuguese society. Milgram also says that modern anti-Semitism failed [...] "to establish even a toehold in Portugal" [...] while it grew racist and virulent elsewhere in early twentieth-century Europe. Salazar`s policies towards the Jews seem to have been favorable and consistent. [...] " [...] Nevertheless although it was not anti-Semitism that motivated the Portuguese government, but the danger of mass emigration to the country,the outcome of the border policy made life difficult for Jews fleeing Nazism.|$|E

How great the wrench is when this supreme moment arrives we have all felt too keenly ever to forget.

From the religion of our mother to the birth of our boyish first love, all our early associations send <b>down</b> <b>roots</b> so deep that long after our minds have outgrown them our hearts refuse to give them up.

60|$|The great Banyan tree (Ficus Indica) {{is still}} the pride and {{ornament}} of the garden. Dr. Falconer has ascertained satisfactorily {{that it is only}} seventy-five years old: annual rings, size, etc., afford no evidence in such a case, but people were alive a few years ago who remembered well its site being occupied in 1782 by a Kujoor (Date-palm), out of whose crown the Banyan sprouted, and beneath which a Fakir sat. It is a remarkable fact that the banyan hardly ever vegetates on the ground; but its figs are eaten by birds, and the seeds deposited in the crowns of palms, where they grow, sending <b>down</b> <b>roots</b> that embrace and eventually kill the palm, which decays away. This tree is now eighty feet high, and throws an area 300 feet* [Had this tree been growing in 1849 over the great palm-stove at Kew, only thirty feet of each end of that vast structure would have been uncovered: its increase was proceeding so rapidly, that by this time it could probably cover the whole. Larger banyans are common in Bengal; but few are so symmetrical in shape and height. As the tree gets old, it breaks up into separate masses, the original trunk decaying, and the props becoming separate trunks of the different portions.] in diameter into a dark, cool shade. The gigantic limbs spread out about ten feet above the ground, and from neglect during Dr. Wallich's absence, there were on Dr. Falconer's arrival no more than eighty-nine descending roots or props; there are now several hundreds, and the growth of this grand mass of vegetation is proportionably stimulated and increased. The props are induced to sprout by wet clay and moss tied to the branches, beneath which a little pot of water is hung, and after they have made some progress, they are inclosed in bamboo tubes, and so coaxed down to the ground. They are mere slender whip-cords before reaching the earth, where they root, remaining very lax for several months; but gradually, as they grow and swell to the size of cables, they tighten, and eventually become very tense. This is a curious phenomenon, and so rapid, that it appears to be due to the rooting part mechanically dragging down the aerial. The branch meanwhile continues to grow outwards, and being supplied by its new support, thickens beyond it, whence the props always slant outwards from the ground towards the circumference of the tree.|$|E
60|$|I see by {{the date}} of last {{paragraph}} that this chapter has been in my good Aylesbury printer's type {{for more than a}} year and a half. At this rate, Proserpina has a distant chance of being finished in the spirit-land, with more accurate information derived from the archangel Uriel himself, (not that he is likely to know much about the matter, if he keeps on letting himself be prevented from ever seeing foliage in spring-time by the black demon-winds,) about the year 2000. In the meantime, feeling that perhaps I am sent to tell my readers a little more than is above told, I have had recourse to my botanical friend, good Mr. Oliver of Kew, who has taught me, first, of palms, that they actually stitch themselves into the ground, with a long dipping loop, up and down, of the root fibres, concerning which sempstress-work I shall have a month's puzzlement before I can report on it; secondly, that all the increment of tree stem is, by division and multiplication of the cells of the wood, a process not in the least to be described as 'sending <b>down</b> <b>roots</b> from the leaf to the ground.' I suspected as much in beginning to revise this chapter; but hold to my judgment in not cancelling it. For this multiplication of the cells is at least compelled by an influence which passes from the leaf to the ground, and vice versa; and which is at present best {168} conceivable to me by imagining the continual and invisible descent of lightning from electric cloud by a conducting rod, endowed with the power of softly splitting the rod into two rods, each as thick as the original one. Studying microscopically, we should then see the molecules of copper, as we see the cells of the wood, dividing and increasing, each one of them into two. But the visible result, and mechanical conditions of growth, would still be the same as if the leaf actually sent down a new root fibre; and, more than this, the currents of accumulating substance, marked by the grain of the wood, are, I think, quite plainly and absolutely those of streams flowing only from the leaves downwards; never from the root up, nor of mere lateral increase. I must look over all my drawings again, and at tree stems again, with more separate study of the bark and pith in those museum sections, before I can assert this; but there will be no real difficulty in the investigation. If the increase of the wood is lateral only, the currents round the knots will be compressed at the sides, and open above and below; but if downwards, compressed above the knot and open below it. The nature of the force itself, and the manner of its ordinances in direction, remain, and must for ever remain, inscrutable as our own passions, in the hand of the God of all Spirits, and of all Flesh.|$|E

However, other studies showed that there is in fact no reduction in AM colonization in the presence of NaCl and even increases in sporulation and colonization occur (Aliasgharzadeh et al.
