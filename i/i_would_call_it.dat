He had married a lady. A perfect lady. She was a dear little woman, too. As to her pluck, I, who know what times {{they had to go}} through, I cannot admire her enough for it.

6000|$|I have republished {{all these}} old {{articles}} of mine because they cover {{a very controversial}} period, in which I was in nearly all the controversies, whether I was visible there or no. And I wish to gather up into this last article a valedictory violence about all such things; and then pass to where, beyond these voices, there is peace&mdash;or in other words, to the writing of Penny Dreadfuls; a noble and much-needed work. But before I finally desert the illusions of rationalism for the actualities of romance, I should {{very much like to}} write one last roaring, raging book telling all the rationalists not to be so utterly irrational. The book would be simply a string of violent vetoes, like the Ten Commandments. <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> [...] "Don'ts for Dogmatists; or Things I am Tired Of." ...|$|E

60|$|She was {{probably}} not {{the daughter of a}} hundred earls, but there must have been some such far-descended fair among the ladies who showed themselves {{from time to time in}} the royal paddock across a little space from our Grand Stand. The enclosure has no doubt a more technical name, which <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> by if I knew it, for I do not wish to be irreverent; but paddock is very sporty, and it must serve my occasion. The King never showed himself there at all, though much craned round for and eagerly expected. But ladies and gentlemen moved about in the close, and stood and talked together; very tall people, very easily straight and well set up, very handsome, and very amiable-looking; they may have been really kind and good, or they may have looked so to please the King and keep his spirits up. I did not then, but I do now, realize that these were courtiers, such as one has always read of, and were of very historical quality in their attendance on the monarch. I trust it will not take from the dignity of the fact if I note that several of the courtiers wore derby hats, and one was in a sack coat and a topper. I am not sure what the fairer reader will think if I tell that one of the ladies had on a dress with a white body and crimson skirt and sleeves, and a vast black picture-hat, and wore it with a charming air of authority.|$|E
6000|$|Somewhere at the back, in some {{pleasure}} {{ground or}} casino or place of entertainment, an undaunted brass band was playing against the cosmic uproar. I {{do not know}} what band it was. Judging from the boisterous British Imperialism of most of the airs it played, I should think it was a German band. But there was no doubt about its energy, and when I came quite close under it it really drowned the storm. It was playing such things as [...] "Tommy Atkins" [...] and [...] "You Can Depend on Young Australia," [...] and many others of which I do not know the words, but I should think they would be [...] "John, Pat, and Mac, With the Union Jack," [...] or that fine though unwritten poem, [...] "Wait till the Bull Dog gets a bite of you." [...] Now, I for one detest Imperialism, but I {{have a great deal of}} sympathy with Jingoism. And there seemed something so touching about this unbroken and innocent bragging under the brutal menace of Nature that it made, if I may so put it, two tunes in my mind. It is so obvious and so jolly to be optimistic about England, especially when you are an optimist--and an Englishman. But through all that glorious brass came the voice of the invasion, the undertone of that awful sea. I did a foolish thing. As I could not express my meaning in an article, I tried to express it in a poem--a bad one. You can call it what you like. It might be called [...] "Doubt," [...] or [...] "Brighton." [...] It might be called [...] "The Patriot," [...] or yet again [...] "The German Band."

5000|$|Crolla was a 1980s British high fashion {{brand and}} {{boutique}} founded by Scott Crolla and Georgina Godley in Mayfair's Dover Street. Always niche, it was influential for its juxtaposition of unusual and vintage fabrics (often furnishing fabrics) and traditional tailoring. Describing the brand's signature at the time, Scott Crolla said: [...] "My clothes are {{for someone who}} disregards fashion but enjoys fabrics… <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>call</b> <b>it</b> a calculated disregard for conventional taste."

5000|$|In {{designing}} the typeface's predecessors Concorde and Roissy, Frutiger's goal {{had been to}} create a sans-serif typeface with the rationality and cleanliness of Univers but the organic and proportional aspects of Gill Sans. Frutiger: [...] "What was important, was total clarity - <b>I</b> <b>would</b> even <b>call</b> <b>it</b> nudity - an absence {{of any kind of}} artistic addition.". Designing Frutiger as a print version of Roissy, this principle resulted in a distinctive and legible typeface. The letter properties originally suited to the needs of Charles de Gaulle: a modern appearance and legibility at various angles, sizes, and distances. Ascenders and descenders are very prominent, and apertures are wide to easily distinguish letters from one another. Improvements on Roissy included better spacing.|$|R
