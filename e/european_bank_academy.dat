40|$|When {{publishing}} {{the results of}} the recapitalization exercise, the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Authority reported that <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> had been successfully recapitalized and was now in a much stronger position, with a much strengthened capital base and overall resilience. 9 ̆ 1 <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> have made significant progress in boosting their capital positions and in strengthening the overall resilience of the <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system 9 ̆ 2, said Andrea Enria, Chairman of the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Authority. 9 ̆ 1 More than 8 ̆ 0200 bn has been injected into the <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system 9 ̆ 2, he continued, and <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> 9 ̆ 1 are now in a better shape to finance the real economy 9 ̆ 2 (EBA 2012 c: 1). Our analysis questions this assessment. The recapitalization orchestrated by the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Authority was based on a capital assessment methodology that has been subject to considerable scholarly criticism. 1 The methodology of basing regulatory capital requirements on risk-weighted assets is a less reliable indicator of banks 9 ̆ 2 soundness and resilience than much simpler ratios of capital to total assets (Acharya et al. 2011). The paper therefore compares the assessments undertaken by EBA 9 ̆ 6 all of which are based on risk-weighted assets 9 ̆ 6 with data on leverage ratios, defined as equity capital to total assets...|$|R

40|$|Large {{and growing}} {{international}} financial linkages between East and West {{have altered the}} nature of the stability risks faced by <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> systems, increasing susceptibility to contagion. This paper aims to identify potential risks of cross-border contagion using a sample of large Western and Eastern <b>European</b> <b>banks.</b> We assume that contagion risk is associated with extreme co-movements in a market-based measure of bank soundness, controlling for common underlying factors. We also find evidence that contagion risk across <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> heightened significantly during the recent crisis. Contagion among Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> with the highest market share in Eastern Europe and from this group to Eastern <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> shows the largest increase in our sample. We find also evidence of contagion spreading from Eastern <b>European</b> <b>banks,</b> but this effect seems to reflect a broader phenomenon of contagion from emerging markets to banks in advanced countries exposed to these markets. Finally, our findings offer only mixed evidence of the existence of a direct ownership channel in the transmission of contagion.

40|$|The {{diversity}} of national banking {{systems in the}} <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system {{and the absence of}} consolidated supervision creates the premises for a series of interrogations whose essence is the same: Is it possible to discuss about a Pan <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> System? The starting point in answering this question was the efforts to create a single banking market, which took place in 1973 - 1999, and the impact of integration on the <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Industry. Among the most representative aspects, it must be emphasized the necessity of consolidating banking supervision at an European level, considering that the International Banking Community studies the problematic of banking regulations at a global level. The two dimensions of the prudential and <b>European</b> <b>bank</b> supervision device – the geographic and the institutional – demand the creation of a structural reform in order to ensure the functioning of a Pan <b>European</b> system of <b>banking</b> supervision and regulations. The considerations on the Consolidation of <b>European</b> <b>Banking</b> Supervision draws into discussion the Financial Supervision Authority which has generalized as an applicable model in numerous European countries and has been mentioned as an alternative of Pan <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> supervision. In the process of the integration of the banking sector, the Basel II Accord represents an opportunity in reaching a convergence of national regulations and practices in matters of risk management, considering that these actions are in line with the preoccupations of realizing a Pan <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system. Thus, the creation of Pan <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> system involves actions in more directions: legal, institutional, operational meant to ensure the consolidation of banking supervision...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} whether discretionary provisioning by Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> is driven by income smoothing or credit risk considerations. We find evidence that discretionary provisioning by Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> is driven by income smoothing incentives in the post-financial crisis period, particularly, among listed banks. Also, we observe that discretionary provisioning is significantly influenced by credit risk factors, mainly, non-performing loans and loan growth. Also, we find that discretionary provisioning by Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> is procyclical with fluctuations in the economic cycle. Overall, the implication of the findings is that discretionary provisioning among Western <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> is driven by both income smoothing and credit risk considerations...|$|R

40|$|In {{this thesis}} the {{determinants}} of market-to-book ratio on <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> from 1987 - 2012 is analyzed with focus on determining whether <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> are under a too-big-to-fai protection, or if they are too big to save. The thesis argues that <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> on average trades with a relative premium due to too-big-to-fail protection, and that {{the largest and most}} systemic banks are priced lower than its less systemic peers, possibly through being too big to save. This tendency is strengthened in the years after 2008.

40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to estimate comparable efficiency scores for <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> {{operating in the}} Single Market in the EU. Using a data set of more than 5000 large commercial banks from all major <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> markets over the period 1993 - 2004, the application of meta-frontiers enables us to assess {{the existence of a}} single and integrated <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> market. We find evidence in favor of a single <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> market characterized by cost and profit meta-frontiers. However, compared to the meta-frontier estimations, pooled frontier estimations tend to underestimate efficiency levels and correlate poorly with country-specific frontier efficiency ranks.

40|$|This paper designs a {{systemic}} risk measure for the <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> {{system as a}} hypothetical distress insurance premium (DIP), which integrates economically the main characteristics of systemic risk—size, default probability, and interconnectedness. We further identify the individual contributions of 58 major <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> to the systemic risk measure. We find that the <b>European</b> <b>banking</b> systemic risk reached its height in late 2011 around € 500 billion, and the sovereign default factor is the dominant driver for the European debt crisis. Our approach identifies a number of systemically important <b>European</b> <b>banks,</b> but smaller Italian and Spanish banks as groups have notably increased their systemic importance. Our findings provide support for the European-wide macroprudential regulation of banking systemic risk. JEL Classification G 15, G 21, G 28...|$|R

40|$|Purpose The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} whether <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> use commission and fee income (CF) to smooth reported earnings or to persistently increase reported earnings as an income-increasing earnings management strategy. Design/methodology/approach The author tests the income-smoothing hypothesis following the approach of Stubben (2010) and Ahmed et al. (1999). Findings The author finds that <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> use CF to smooth reported earnings and this behaviour is pronounced among non-too-big-to-fail (NTBTF) <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> compared to too-big-to-fail (TBTF) <b>European</b> <b>banks.</b> The author also finds a positive and significant correlation between interest income and non-interest income (CF) indicating increased systematic risk due to reduced diversification benefits. The author also finds that the CF of NTBTF banks is procyclical with fluctuating economic conditions but not for TBTF banks. Also, the author finds evidence for income-increasing earnings management in the post-crisis period, for larger <b>European</b> <b>banks</b> and when banks have higher ex post interest income, implying that the propensity to engage in income-increasing earnings management significantly depends on bank size and ex post interest margin considerations. The findings have policy implications. Originality/value The author examines alternative financial numbers that banks use to manage earnings. The author focusses on income smoothing via CF among <b>European</b> <b>banks,</b> a context that has not been explored in the literature...|$|R
