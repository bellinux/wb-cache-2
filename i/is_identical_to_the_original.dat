2500|$|The {{defining}} {{property of}} a crystal is its inherent symmetry, {{by which we}} mean that under certain 'operations' the crystal remains unchanged. All crystals have translational symmetry in three directions, but some have other symmetry elements as well. For example, rotating the crystal 180° about a certain axis may result in an atomic configuration that <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> configuration. The crystal is then said to have a twofold rotational symmetry about this axis. In addition to rotational symmetries like this, a crystal may have symmetries {{in the form of}} mirror planes and translational symmetries, and also the so-called [...] "compound symmetries," [...] which are a combination of translation and rotation/mirror symmetries. A full classification of a crystal is achieved when all of these inherent symmetries of the crystal are identified.|$|E

Sales in 2007 were 231% greater than in 2006 at Selfridge's London; as of October 2007, the Wayfarer was the Luxottica Group's third-best-selling style.|$|E
2500|$|The Wii was {{released}} {{during the holiday}} season of 2006 worldwide. The system features the Wii Remote controller, which {{can be used as a}} handheld pointing device and which detects movement in three dimensions. Another notable feature of the console is WiiConnect24, which enables it to receive messages and updates over the Internet while in standby mode. It also features a game download service, called [...] "Virtual Console", which features emulated games from past systems. Since its release, the Wii has spawned many peripheral devices, including the Wii Balance Board and Motion Plus, and has had several hardware revisions. The Wii Family Edition variant <b>is</b> <b>identical</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> <b>original</b> model, but is designed to sit horizontally and removes the GameCube compatibility.
