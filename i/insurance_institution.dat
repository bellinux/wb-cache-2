5|$|Interior Minister Anne Holmlund, who {{had ordered}} the {{original}} investigation into the police officers' conduct in the Kauhajoki incident, said that legislation would be introduced to aid police officers in accessing information about the {{mental and physical health}} of applicants for firearms licenses. This included, potentially, the ability to gain detailed information about an applicant's health, the right to subpoena records from the Finnish Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>Institution,</b> and the right to request further information if the applicant had a history of using medication. In addition to this, Holmlund said that the referencing process for being granted a firearms license would be intensified: two referees would have to be personally interviewed before a license was granted. Holmlund also pointed to legislation of the EU as her starting point. Other reforms, that she said would be introduced as late as spring 2009, included a national register of gun owners. Parliamentary debates occurred on whether to raise the age at which one could own a gun, or whether to put further checks in place, in September 2009.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{comprehensive}} public sector, private healthcare sector is relatively small. Between 3-4% of in-patient care {{is provided by}} the private healthcare system. Physiotherapy, dentistry and occupational health services are the most often used health services on the private sector. Approximately 10% of medical doctors work solely on private sector. Although high user fees may cause a barrier to use the private sector services as most is paid for out of pocket, a significant share of the cost is reimbursed by the Social <b>Insurance</b> <b>Institution</b> (SII) KELA.|$|E

The NHI also partially reimburses occupational healthcare costs for services delivered to employees, but not to dependents.|$|E

40|$|<b>Insurance</b> <b>institutions</b> {{which are}} {{operated}} by public sector have two characters; one is as redistribution institution, {{and the other}} is as financial institution which manage large amount of funds. The fact that public <b>insurance</b> <b>institutions</b> (PuII) invest large amount of funds means that the activity of PuII seriously affects macro economy through flow of funds. The {{purpose of this paper is}} to evaluate the performance of PuII with the model in which inter-institutional flow of funds matrix is linked to production function. With the investment return, the efficiency of funds management at PuII itself is only evaluated. Whereas, with the effect on GDP calculated from the model which we developed, the efficiency of funds distribution in macro economy can be evaluated. We calculated and compared the effect of PuII and Private <b>insurance</b> <b>institutions</b> (PrII). The main result of this paper is the effect of PuII is smaller than that of PrII through the period of our analysis, however the difference between PuII and PrII is becoming small. Therefore approximating portfolio of PuII to that of PrII is effective in macro economy, with consideration about the implication of managing by public sector.

40|$|In this paper, the {{technical}} efficiency and the super-efficiency of {{a representative sample}} of <b>insurance</b> <b>institutions</b> in Slovakia is analyzed with the aid of data envelopment analysis (DEA). This paper differs from the so far published literature, as it extends the application of radial DEA models (the CCR model of Charnes, Cooper and Rodes; the BCC model of Banker, Charnes and Cooper) by a non-radial model (the SBM model of Tone) and a super-efficiency model. The supper-efficiency can be used either to rank efficient units or to indicate outliers in the analyzed group of decision making units. Achieved results also reveal that in the year 2013, among 13 Slovak insurance companies under evaluation, the AXA poisťovňa, a. s. was the super-efficient insurance company. The implications of gained results are then drawn for managerial and regulatory purposes. Firstly, it is shown how the management of the <b>insurance</b> <b>institutions</b> with the poorest performances should change their managerial procedures and adopt enhanced-incentive policy. Secondly, the regulatory body of the <b>insurance</b> <b>institutions</b> should utilize the gained technical efficiency of the analyzed institutions for the prediction of their competitiveness in the long run...|$|R
