5|$|This king {{established}} {{a number of}} enduring traditions in Imerina. A law imposing a fine on a homeowner whose house fire destroys neighboring property was promulgated by Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana. He also established the rule that all citizens of Ambohimanga or Antananarivo should pass to offer hasina to the sovereign and wish him or <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> life if a fire ever broke out in their city, and that citizens should likewise congratulate the owners of houses that were spared from destruction if a fire had occurred nearby. He designated specific areas where water could be drawn for use in royal circumcision ceremonies. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana also created three formal ways of pronouncing a sacred and binding oath; these included the mively rano (striking {{the surface of a}} body of water with a stick), the milefon'omby (striking a calf with a spear) and the misotro vokaka (drinking water mixed with ashes taken from a king's tomb). After capturing Ambohitrabiby, he obliged all the andriana (nobles) and other powerful figures in the community there to formalize their allegiance to him by enacting one of these oaths.|$|E
500|$|Ken Tucker from Entertainment Weekly was {{positive}} towards both this episode and the season premiere, [...] "Within," [...] awarding the episodes an [...] "A-". George Avalos and Michael Liedtke from the Contra Costa Times praised the episode {{and noted that}} the Scully/Dogget dynamic and the hunt for Fox Mulder worked towards the show's strengths. Tom Janulewicz from Space.com positively commented on Scully's conversion from skeptic to believer, writing, [...] "Regardless of whether it's aliens, flukemen, or pizza delivering vampires, The X-Files is all about phenomena that don't stand {{in the face of}} 'rational' explanations. It took <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time, but like Mulder before her, Scully eventually came to accept that there are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamt of in her philosophy." ...|$|E
2500|$|In January 1996, Miss Elizabeth {{returned}} to wrestling as manager for Savage. A month later {{she turned on}} Savage by helping Ric Flair defeat him at SuperBrawl VI and then became Flair's co-manager in the Four Horsemen along with Woman. She later turned against the Four Horsemen and joined the New World Order (nWo) alongside Hogan, but seemed to still care deeply for her ex-husband, and eventually joined his side when he too joined the nWo months later. In June 1998, she parted ways with Savage once again by joining Hogan's side of the nWo: nWo Hollywood. Then, she accompanied Eric Bischoff {{on his way to}} the ring for the next few months, and derided Savage. Savage coldly reminded her that he [...] "got over <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time ago" [...] and didn't need her.|$|E

2500|$|In later years, as a driver, Coutts got no. 80, a Manson 4-4-0, {{and he had}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while. One {{night he}} was on the 5.10 with her, 50 minutes {{non-stop}} for the 41.9 miles [...] to Ayr; Felix Hill was firing to him. Well, some of the [...] "Heid Yins" [...] were going down to Turnberry Hotel for the weekend, and they were travelling in the Directors' Saloon, a vehicle which Mr. C Hamilton Ellis once described as of [...] "more than imperial splendour". The G men had no such reverence for it. They called it, crudely, and no doubt unfairly, [...] "The Shebeen". Some economist at St Enoch thought that a bit of mileage might be saved by tacking [...] "the Shebeen" [...] {{on the back of the}} 5.10. Now the 5.10 in those days went out by way of Paisley Canal, a route which has about as much curvature per mile as the Darjeeling-Himalayan, and with only ten minutes allowed in which to cover the first 8¼miles to Paisley, a driver hadn't much time to ponder over radii and centrifugal force.|$|E
60|$|When Christian came to him, Mr. Treffry raised {{himself and}} looked at <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while.|$|E
60|$|The nod was repeated, and Mary, with {{suspended}} iron, gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> and curions look.|$|E
60|$|Mrs. Travers {{disengaged}} {{her arm and}} Lingard stopped, too, facing <b>her</b> in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> silence.|$|R
60|$|Bernard {{folded his}} hands together--almost devoutly--and stood gazing at <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> inarticulate murmur of satisfaction.|$|R
60|$|When {{the cart}} arrived Mrs. Donald ran out and, as Kate descended, clasped <b>her</b> in <b>a</b> <b>long</b> embrace.|$|R
60|$|He gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> searching look; {{and when}} he spoke, his voice had a {{hollowness}} in it that was strangely terrifying.|$|E
60|$|After Gebhart had {{gazed at}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> long time, {{he took up}} the goblet and the dagger {{from the table and}} turned towards the door.|$|E
6000|$|... "Shall I ring?" [...] he said, {{after what}} seemed to <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> while. She moved her head in assent, and after ringing {{he went to his}} dressing-room.|$|E
6000|$|... "We will anchor {{about two}} hundred and fifty yards outside <b>her.</b> <b>As</b> <b>long</b> as she lies quiet there we will leave her alone. If she tries to make off we will board her at once. Anchor with the kedge; that will hold <b>her</b> here. Have <b>a</b> buoy on the cable and have it ready to slip at a moment's notice, and the sails all ready to hoist." ...|$|R
60|$|After Hazel had {{restored}} her chum {{to consciousness}} she sat looking at <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time before either spoke.|$|R
60|$|Pierson {{turned and}} looked at <b>her.</b> For <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time after, she could not get that look out of her memory.|$|R
6000|$|Strether {{looked at}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time; then looked {{all about the}} room; then came a little nearer. [...] "Will you never tell any {{one in the world}} as long as ever you live?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Gereth gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> last look, {{then turned}} {{abruptly}} away. [...] "It's an awful bore you didn't really {{get it out}} of him! Well, come to tea," [...] she added rather dryly, passing straight into the house.|$|E
6000|$|Finding {{nothing to}} amuse {{her in the}} sitting-room, Zo had tried the bedroom next. She now {{returned}} to Ovid, dragging after <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> white staff that looked like an Alpen-stock. [...] "What's this?" [...] she asked. [...] "A broomstick?" ...|$|E
60|$|Lady Barbara {{first took}} her up-stairs, and showed <b>her</b> <b>a</b> little <b>long</b> narrow bed-room, {{with a pretty}} pink-curtained bed in it.|$|R
60|$|Winton {{looked at}} <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time without speaking, his brows drawn down, frowning, puzzled, as though {{over his own}} past.|$|R
2500|$|At the 2008 Democratic National Convention, Chelsea called Hillary [...] "my {{hero and}} my mother" [...] and {{introduced}} <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>long</b> video tribute.|$|R
6000|$|Cornelia {{turned and}} gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> stare. Miss Maybough broke her bit of cake in two, {{and offered her}} half, and Cornelia took it mechanically, but ate her sandwich. [...] "I feel as if I had eternity behind me, I've been in the Preparatory so long." ...|$|E
60|$|At {{last she}} was aware of a man close beside her. He had been {{following}} <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way, she recollected now; but she had not feared him, even heeded him. But when he laid his hand upon her arm, she turned fiercely, but without dread.|$|E
60|$|She dances in a foul gloom where gum bums with garlic. A sailorman, rustbearded, sips from {{a beaker}} rum and eyes <b>her.</b> <b>A</b> <b>long</b> and seafed silent rut. She dances, capers, wagging her sowish {{haunches}} and her hips, on her gross belly flapping a ruby egg.|$|E
6000|$|... "The {{way they}} both {{made up to}} me was disgusting. But I know the girl is just <b>a</b> tool in <b>her</b> mother's hands. Her mother seemed {{actually}} passive in comparison. For skilful wheedling I could fall down and worship that woman; I really admire <b>her.</b> <b>As</b> <b>long</b> as the girl was with us she kept herself {{in the background and}} put the girl at me. It was simply a masterpiece." ...|$|R
60|$|A {{few minutes}} later, and the despairing {{people on the}} wreck, {{catching}} sight of the boat, greeted <b>her</b> with <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> wild cheer of reviving hope.|$|R
50|$|Sojin {{said that}} her biggest {{influence}} in life is Uhm Jung-hwa. She describes <b>her</b> as <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time leader of her generation who shows abundant expressiveness and depth.|$|R
60|$|It was {{not until}} ten years {{afterwards}} that I heard anything more of the old chest. Grandmother Laurance had died, but Aunt Winnifred still lived at the Grange. She was very lonely, and the winter after Grandmother's death she sent me an invitation to make <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> visit.|$|E
60|$|He looked round {{his studio}} wearily; {{he had loved}} it because her {{presence}} had made it gay and homelike; {{he shut his eyes}} for an instant; then he gave <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> look as though to impress on his mind the picture of her. He got up and took his hat.|$|E
6000|$|... ‘I’ll warrant,’ she observes, when he {{has been}} looking fixedly at her for some {{consecutive}} moments, with a singular appearance in his eyes of seeming to see <b>her</b> <b>a</b> <b>long</b> way off, instead of so near him: ‘I’ll warrant you made the journey in a many ways, when you made it so often?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|Hiram {{stood looking}} broodingly at <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time; then {{at last he}} again spoke. [...] "I thought a sight of you onc't, Sally," [...] said he.|$|R
60|$|He {{stared at}} <b>her</b> in <b>a</b> <b>long,</b> furious silence, then {{exploded}} into oaths, and finally inveighed against her unnaturalness and pronounced her bewitched by that foul dog Tressilian.|$|R
5000|$|A {{situation}} {{which is not}} to displease to all, it suits perfectly to Rangadoré (M.R.Radha), a good-for-nothing and kinship of Ponni, that he desires <b>her</b> for <b>a</b> <b>long</b> time! ...|$|R
