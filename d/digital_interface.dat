5|$|Kurt Harland {{composed}} most of {{the music}} for Soul Reaver; Jim Hedges handled the remaining audio. Harland remarked that, under Amy Hennig's direction, he programmed music to change based on the current gameplay situation—for example, combat or swimming. This variation was accomplished through a custom Musical Instrument <b>Digital</b> <b>Interface</b> (MIDI) driver, which altered music based on signals from the game engine. Each vampire tribe had corresponding music; one tribe of vampires {{was associated with a}} slow, thumping theme to convey a sense of working machinery. To further fit the music to the environment, the sound team consulted level designers regarding layout and appearance. Music from both Soul Reaver and Soul Reaver 2 was released on a promotional soundtrack in 2001.|$|E
5|$|Weapons {{upgrades}} {{include the}} 1760 Internal Weapons Bay Upgrade (IWBU), which gives a 66 {{percent increase in}} weapons payload using a <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> and rotary launcher. IWBU is expected to cost roughly $313 million. The 1760 IWBU will allow the B-52 to carry the AGM-158B JASSM-ER cruise missile and the ADM-160C MALD-J decoy missile. All 1760 IWBUs should be operational by October 2017. Two bombers will {{have the ability to}} carry 40 weapons in place of the 36 that three B-52s can carry. The 1760 IWBU allows precision-guided missiles or bombs to be deployed from inside the weapons bay; previous aircraft carried these munitions externally on wing hardpoints. This increases the number of guided weapons a B-52 can carry and reduces the need for guided bombs to be carried on the wings. The first phase will allow a B-52 to carry twenty-four 500-pound guided JDAM bombs or twenty 2,000-pound JDAMs, with later phases accommodating the JASSM and MALD family of missiles. In addition to carrying more smart bombs, moving them internally from the wings reduces drag and achieves a 15 percent reduction in fuel consumption.|$|E

25|$|Although {{widely known}} for its {{analogue}} technology, SSL {{was one of the}} digital audio pioneers and put together an impressive team of digital engineers under the leadership of Peter Eastty. The team defected en masse to become Oxford Digital (subsequently Sony Oxford) and SSL had to start over. Recognising the importance of <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> standardisation {{to the future of the}} industry, SSL partnered with Sony and Studer to develop the now widespread MADI (Multichannel Audio <b>Digital</b> <b>Interface)</b> protocol. The new team, led by Phil Hill, developed an eight channel editor, ScreenSound, followed by workstations, Scenaria and OmniMix; all targeted at the post-production market. This technology formed the basis of SSL 'A Series' consoles starting with Axiom and followed by Aysis, Avant, Aysis Air and Axiom MT. These consoles offered knob per function type control surfaces that were familiar to a generation of engineers who had grown up with SSL's analogue consoles.|$|E
50|$|To enable {{applications}} to sense, control, {{and communicate with}} a single low-power microcontroller, the EFM32 MCUs contain complete analog and <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces.</b> Serial <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> include USART, low energy UART, I2C, and USB. The timer and triggers block of the MCU includes a cryotimer, low energy pulse counter (PCNT), and backup Real-Time-Counter (RTC). Analog modules include ADCs, DACs, Operational Amplifiers, and analog comparators. For applications that demand heightened security protections, the EFM32 MCUs offer various hardware crypto engines and cyclic redundancy check (CRC). For general I/O, the MCUs feature up to 93 GPIO pins, and several variants feature LCD controllers.|$|R
40|$|Self-interference between <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> and {{on-board}} wireless modules and antennas {{is rapidly}} becoming {{a major problem}} for Printed Circuit Board engineers. In this paper, the severity of on-board self-interference is quantified. Two working conditions are considered. First, the situation is considered in which the antenna is in receive mode. As the incoming (signal) fields are most often rather low, only small (signal) voltages are induced at the antenna port. It is shown with a simple example that the level of the noise voltage induced at the antenna port due to the switching of <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces</b> can be significant compared to the signal voltage, thereby leading to a low Signal-to-Noise Ratio. Second, the situation is considered in which the antenna is in transmit mode. As the power radiated by the on-board antenna can be quite large (e. g. typically 2 Watt for GSM), the signal voltages at the antenna port can be quite large. With the same simple example, it is shown that this leads to a significant noise signal at the <b>digital</b> <b>interfaces,</b> thereby increasing the Bit Error Rate. status: publishe...|$|R

In early versions of the serial <b>digital</b> <b>interface,</b> it was always possible to uniquely determine the video format by counting the number of lines and samples between H and V transitions in the TRS.

25|$|In 1980, a {{group of}} musicians and music merchants met to {{standardize}} an interface that new instruments could use to communicate control instructions with other instruments and computers. This standard was dubbed Musical Instrument <b>Digital</b> <b>Interface</b> (MIDI) and resulted from a collaboration between leading manufacturers, initially Sequential Circuits, Oberheim, Roland—and later, other participants that included Yamaha, Korg, and Kawai. A paper was authored by Dave Smith of Sequential Circuits and proposed to the Audio Engineering Society in 1981. Then, in August 1983, the MIDI Specification 1.0 was finalized.|$|E
25|$|For HDTV applications, {{the serial}} <b>digital</b> <b>interface</b> {{is defined by}} SMPTE 292M. Two bit rates are defined, 1.485Gbit/s, and 1.485/1.001Gbit/s.

25|$|In the 1970s, {{electronic}} music began having a {{significant influence on}} popular music, with the adoption of polyphonic synthesizers, electronic drums, drum machines, and turntables, through the emergence of genres such as disco, krautrock, new wave, synth-pop, hip hop and EDM. In the 1980s, {{electronic music}} became more dominant in popular music, with a greater reliance on synthesizers, and the adoption of programmable drum machines such as the Roland TR-808 and bass synthesizers such as the TB-303. In the early 1980s, digital technologies for synthesizers including digital synthesizers such as the Yamaha DX7 were popularized, {{and a group of}} musicians and music merchants developed the Musical Instrument <b>Digital</b> <b>Interface</b> (MIDI).|$|E
25|$|For {{portions}} of the vertical and horizontal blanking regions which are not used for ancillary data, {{it is recommended that}} the luma samples be assigned the code word 64 (40 hex), and the chroma samples be assigned 512 (200 hex); both of which correspond to 0mV. It is permissible to encode analog vertical interval information (such as vertical interval timecode or vertical interval test signals) without breaking the interface, but such usage is nonstandard (and ancillary data is the preferred means for transmitting metadata). Conversion of analog sync and burst signals into digital, however, is not recommended—and neither is necessary in the <b>digital</b> <b>interface.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the late}} 1960s to 1970s, the {{development}} of miniaturized solid-state components allowed synthesizers to become self-contained, portable instruments, as proposed by Harald Bode in 1961.

This, along with {{the development of}} Musical Instrument <b>Digital</b> <b>Interface</b> (MIDI), made it easier to integrate and synchronize synthesizers and other electronic instruments for use in musical composition. In the 1990s, synthesizer emulations began to appear in computer software, known as software synthesizers. From 1996 onward, Steinberg's Virtual Studio Technology (VST) plug-ins – {{and a host of other}} kinds of competing plug-in software, all designed to run on personal computers – began emulating classic hardware synthesizers, becoming increasingly successful at doing so during the following decades.|$|E
