5|$|The golden white-eye is a generalist, {{feeding on}} fruit, berries, and insects. Nectar forms {{part of the}} diet, and, along with the Micronesian myzomela and the bridled white-eye, the golden white-eye is a {{pollinator}} of some trees, albeit not one as important as these other species. Insects may be either gleaned from the bark of trees and from leaves, or caught in the air. Certain tree species are preferred as foraging habitat. The common <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> Cynometra ramifolia is the most favoured tree and used more frequently than the equally common Guamia mariannae. There is considerable overlap between this species' foraging range {{and that of the}} bridled white-eye, but the golden white-eye is more generalised in its diet. Within the forest there is some partitioning of niche, with bridled white-eyes (and Micronesian myzomelas) feeding primarily in the forest canopy, and the golden white-eye feeding in both the canopy and understory of the forest, as well as a variety of smaller trees and bushes. It shares the understory with the rufous fantail, which has a different feeding technique. At a smaller scale additional partitioning occurs. The golden white-eye shows differences in the preferred microhabitat for obtaining insects, for example, feeding in dead leaves and branches, whereas the bridled white-eye prefers gleaning insects on live leaves. It is the most generalised of all the extant forest passerines on Saipan. It has been suggested that the versatility in diet and foraging technique is an adaptation to the challenges presented by typhoons, which can dramatically alter the structure of the forest.|$|E

For example, the domestication of many crop plants was initiated some 10 000 years ago in the so-called ÔFertile CrescentÕ of the Middle East. By contrast, the domestication of <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> for the purposes of producing more fibre began in earnest in the last half century.

40|$|Planting genetically {{modified}} (GM) or transgenic <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> for wood production is now feasible {{on a commercial}} scale worldwide. What are the benefits? What are the risks? This became an open question two years ago on December 10, 2003, when the United Nations declared that every sovereign nation should decide on its own {{whether or not to}} use {{genetically modified}} forests for carbon sequestration. Although feasible on a commercial scale, we are still {{in the early stages of}} GM technology for <b>forest</b> <b>trees.</b> Some of the major determinants shaping risks of commercial-scale use include type(s) of inserted DNA construct or transgene, 1 but also 1) reproductive biology of the forest species, and 2) the forest production or silvicultural systems. 2 To date, GM <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> are being tested in small trials worldwide. Only China is planting GM <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> on a commercial scale. Central to the issue of GM <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> is the question of biosafety. Will effective biosafety protocols eventually become available, or should we accept that escape of GM <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> is inevitable and study ecological consequences instead? Here I present the argument for the latter and propose a public-private partnership for this purpose, a technology trust. Commercial GM Forests: Predicting the Long-term Consequences Each nation sanctioning genetically engineering <b>forest</b> <b>trees</b> must decide 1) what biosafety protocols should be considered, if any, and 2) weigh the consequences in the event that gene flow from GM forest plantations to th...|$|R

Several genetically modified <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> species are undergoing field trials for deregulation, and much of the research is being carried out by the pulp and paper industry, primarily with the intention of increasing the productivity of existing tree stock. Certain genetically modified orchard tree species have been deregulated for commercial use in the United States including the papaya and plum. The development, testing and use of GM trees remains at an early stage in comparison to GM crops.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though this}} is a field with many uncertainties, it is {{expected}} that over the next 50 years climate changes will {{have an effect on the}} diversity of forest genetic resources and thereby on the distribution of <b>forest</b> <b>tree</b> species and the composition of forests. Diversity of forest genetic resources enables the potential for a species (or a population) to adapt to climatic changes and related future challenges such as temperature changes, drought, pests, diseases and forest fire. However, species are not naturally capable to adapt in the pace of which the climate is changing and the increasing temperatures will most likely facilitate the spread of pests and diseases, creating an additional threat to forest trees and their populations. To inhibit these problems human interventions, such as transfer of forest reproductive material, may be needed.|$|E
25|$|The general {{short-term}} {{effect of}} nitrogen fertilization on coniferous seedlings is to stimulate shoot growth {{more so than}} root growth (Armson and Carman 1961). Over a longer period, root growth is also stimulated. Many nursery managers were long reluctant to apply nitrogenous fertilizers late in the growing season, for fear of increased danger of frost damage to succulent tissues. A presentation at the North American <b>Forest</b> <b>Tree</b> Nursery Soils Workshop at Syracuse in 1980 provided strong contrary evidence: Bob Eastman, President of the Western Maine Forest Nursery Co. stated that for 15 years he {{has been successful in}} avoiding winter “burn” to Norway spruce and white spruce in his nursery operation by fertilizing with 50-80lb/ac (56–90kg/ha) nitrogen in September, whereas previously winter burn had been experienced annually, often severely. Eastman also stated that the overwintering storage capacity of stock thus treated was much improved (Eastman 1980).|$|E

2500|$|On February 1, 1906 {{the state}} of Pennsylvania {{purchased}} the former lands of the ironworks and village from the Logan Iron and Steel Company. [...] The State Forest Reserve Commission established the Greenwood <b>Forest</b> <b>Tree</b> Nursery (which later became the state park) on part of the land, while the rest was made part of the [...] "Greenwood Reserves" [...] and eventually became part of Rothrock State Forest. The soil was ideally suited {{for use as a}} tree nursery after the years of use as an iron furnace. The remnants of fly ash and charcoal dust enriched the earth with minerals that were needed for the growing of trees. The nursery began operation in 1906 and closed in 1993. During the 1970s and 1980s the nursery produced an average of three million seedlings per year. The seedlings were replanted in forests throughout Pennsylvania. The Pennsylvania Bureau of Forestry recently re-established the tree nursery on a limited basis to provide seedlings for use at its other nurseries and for sale to private nurseries.|$|E
