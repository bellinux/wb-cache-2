5|$|A {{commonly}} studied {{variation of}} the problem involves networks of interior-disjoint smooth curves, with junctions where three {{or more of the}} curves meet. When the junctions all have exactly three curves meeting at angles of 2/3 (the same conditions seen in an optimal Steiner tree or two-dimensional foam of soap bubbles) the flow is well-defined <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term.</b> However, it may eventually reach a singular state with four or more curves meeting at a junction, and there may be {{more than one way to}} continue the flow past such a singularity.|$|E
5|$|On taking office, Reagan {{was faced}} with the same {{decision}} as Carter before: whether {{to continue with the}} B-1 <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term,</b> or to wait {{for the development of the}} ATB, a much more advanced aircraft. Studies suggested that the existing B-52 fleet with ALCM would remain a credible threat until 1985. It was predicted that 75% of the B-52 force would survive to attack its targets. After this, the introduction of the SA-10 missile, the MiG-31 interceptor and the first Soviet Airborne Early Warning and Control (AWACS) systems would make the B-52 increasingly vulnerable. During 1981, funds were allocated to a new study for a bomber for the 1990s time-frame which led to developing the Long-Range Combat Aircraft (LRCA) project. The LRCA evaluated the B-1, F-111, and ATB as possible solutions; an emphasis was placed on multi-role capabilities, as opposed to purely strategic operations.|$|E

500|$|Nero celebrated {{this peace}} {{as a major}} achievement: he was hailed as imperator and held a triumph, {{although}} no new territory had been won, and the peace reflected a compromise rather than a true victory. For although Rome could prevail militarily in Armenia, politically, she had no genuine alternatives to the Arsacid candidacy on offer for the Armenian throne. Armenia would henceforth be ruled by an Iranian dynasty, and despite its nominal allegiance to Rome, it would come under increasing Parthian influence. In the judgment of later generations, [...] "Nero had lost Armenia", and although the Peace of Rhandeia ushered {{in a period of}} relatively peaceful relations that would last for 50 years, Armenia would continue to be a constant bone of contention between the Romans, the Parthians, and their Sassanid successors. <b>For</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term</b> however, the peace that Nero secured was kept by both sides, even while the bulk of Rome's eastern forces was involved in the suppression of the Jewish Revolt.|$|E

500|$|The Jets' {{success in}} signing Namath {{and the rise}} of the team in the standings {{adversely}} affected their crosstown rivals, the Giants, who had played in five NFL championship games in six years to 1963, but who thereafter declined in the standings. [...] Giants owner Wellington Mara stated, [...] "I think the Jets coming in when they did contributed to our bad years, because we tried to do everything <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term</b> rather than the long haul—we'd trade a draft choice for a player, figuring he'd give us one or two good years. We didn't want to accept how the public might react if we had a bad year or two or three." [...] In 1968, the Giants traded for star Minnesota Vikings quarterback Fran Tarkenton in the vain hopes he would lead them to renewed success and rival Namath in the public eye. In August 1969, the Jets faced the Giants in a preseason game at the Yale Bowl. [...] While the Jets' Super Bowl win legitimized the AFL as a comparable league to the NFL in the eyes of many, others doubted the AFL's standard of play, and the Jets were underdogs going into the game. Giants coach Allie Sherman approached the game as if it were a regular season contest, and the Jets sent the three remaining original Titans out for the coin toss. The Jets defeated the Giants 37–14, and Sherman was fired a few weeks later. The Jets' fellow tenants, the Mets, won a championship themselves; the baseball team's accomplishments forced the Jets to play their first five games on the road. The Jets recovered from a slow start to win their second consecutive Eastern Division championship, but fell to Kansas City in the divisional round of the playoffs, 13–6.|$|E

2500|$|No {{medications}} {{are indicated}} for directly treating schizoid personality disorder, but certain medications {{may reduce the}} symptoms of SPD as well as treat co-occurring mental disorders. The symptoms of SPD mirror the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, such as anhedonia, blunted affect and low energy, and SPD {{is thought to be}} part of the [...] "schizophrenic spectrum" [...] of disorders, which also includes the schizotypal and paranoid personality disorders, and may benefit from the medications indicated for schizophrenia. Originally, low doses of atypical antipsychotics like risperidone or olanzapine were used to alleviate social deficits and blunted affect. However, a recent review concluded that atypical antipsychotics were ineffective for treating personality disorders. In contrast, the substituted amphetamine Bupropion may be used to treat anhedonia. Likewise, Modafinil may be effective in treating some of the negative symptoms of schizophrenia, which are reflected in the symptomatology of SPD and therefore may help as well. Lamotrigine, SSRIs, TCAs, MAOIs and Hydroxyzine may help counter social anxiety in people with SPD if present, though social anxiety may not be a main concern for the people who have SPD. However, it is not general practice to treat SPD with medications, other than <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>short</b> <b>term</b> treatment of acute co-occurring Axis I conditions (e.g. depression).|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The {{capacity}} {{planning and}} operation {{problem of a}} multi-purpose water reservoir has been extensively studied in the literature. Optimization techniques, especially linear programming, have been used quite success-fully. Although most models are robust enough as planning tools, they fall short of providing an operational policy <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>shorter</b> <b>term.</b> In this paper, we consider the operation of a multi-purpose water reservoir problem. To elim-inate the shortfalls of the classical models, we develop a multistage stochastic programming model that generates a release policy adapted to the uncertainty in <b>the</b> problem <b>for</b> <b>shorter</b> time periods. <b>The</b> model {{is designed to be}} flexible enough {{to be used as a}} planning or an operational tool. Alternative solution approaches and future research directives are discussed.
