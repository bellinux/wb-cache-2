5|$|On leaving {{school in}} 1934, the 14-year-old Ramsey tried to <b>get</b> <b>a</b> <b>job</b> <b>at</b> the Ford plant, then told his family he {{intended}} to become a greengrocer.

About a year later, during the 1937â€“38 season, Ramsey was spotted by Ned Liddell, a scout from Portsmouth, then a well-established top-flight club. Liddell offered a contract as an amateur.
