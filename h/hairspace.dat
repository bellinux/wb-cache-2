25|$|MacKellar's The American Printer was the {{dominant}} language style guide in the US {{at the time}} and ran to at least 17 editions between 1866 and 1893, and De Vinne's The Practice of Typography was the undisputed global authority on English-language typesetting style from 1901 until well past Dowding's first formal alternative spacing suggestion in the mid-1950s. Both the American and the UK style guides also specified that spaces should be inserted between punctuation and text. The MacKellar guide described these as hairspaces but itself used a much wider space than was then commonly regarded as a <b>hairspace.</b> Spaces following words or punctuation were subject to line breaks, and spaces between words and closely associated punctuation were non-breaking. Additionally, spaces were (and still are today) varied proportionally in width when justifying lines, originally by hand, later by machine, now usually by software.|$|E
50|$|Opening quotes {{should be}} {{followed}} by a <b>hairspace</b> except before A and J. Closing quotes should be preceded by a <b>hairspace</b> except after a comma or a full point. If this cannot be done on the keyboard, omit these hairspaces, but try to get the necessary attachment.|$|E
50|$|Plenken {{was once}} a common {{practice}} in Germany due to the standard German typing approximation of the traditional spacing rules, which {{use a variety of}} different-width spaces and which insert a thin space or <b>hairspace</b> between words and most punctuation marks. With the introduction of the typewriter and its fixed-width space, English-language typists removed most spaces around punctuation marks, but some other languages' typists, including French and German, did not.|$|E
