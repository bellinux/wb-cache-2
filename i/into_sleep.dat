Scientists have {{recorded}} them sleeping for minutes at a time while slowly drifting downward in a belly-up orientation. Like other marine mammals, seals sleep in water with half of their brain awake so that they can detect and escape from predators. When they are asleep on land, both sides of their brain go <b>into</b> <b>sleep</b> mode.|$|E

Dell calls this feature PowerShare, while Toshiba calls it USB Sleep-and-Charge. On Acer Inc. and Packard Bell laptops, sleep-and-charge USB ports are marked with a non-standard symbol (the letters USB over a drawing of a battery); the feature is simply called Power-off USB. On some laptops such as Dell and Apple MacBook models, {{it is possible to}} plug a device in, close the laptop (putting it <b>into</b> <b>sleep</b> mode) and have the device continue to charge.|$|E

5|$|If a cat so chooses, {{they can}} take a {{different}} calling in life {{as that of a}} medicine cat. Medicine cats, unlike warriors, serve for their clan not through bloodshed, but through peace. They are trained to heal their Clanmates by using the natural resources as medicines; for example, cobwebs can be used to stitch deep wounds, whilst poppy seeds are used to lull a distressed cat <b>into</b> <b>sleep.</b> They sleep separately, surrounded by the herbs and resources they need to keep their Clan safe and healthy. Medicine cat apprentices go through a longer period of training than warriors, due to the vast amount of knowledge they must remember. Medicine cats are also not allowed to take any mates or have any kits. This is because they must care for each member of their Clan equally; if they were to form a loving relationship with any one individual, they may unfairly place that catâ€™s life over that of the Clan. A Clan tends to have only one or two, and occasionally three, medicine cats at any given time.|$|E
25|$|A study, using 49 rats {{indicated}} {{the increase of}} sleep spindles during slow-wave sleep following learning. It gave evidence to the increase of spindle frequency during non-REM sleep following paired associate of motor-skill learning tasks. Using an EEG, sleep spindles were detected and showed to be present only during slow-wave sleep. Beginning with a preliminary study, rats underwent six hours of monitored sleep, {{after a period of}} learning. Results showed that during the first hour following learning, there was the most evident effect on learning-modulated sleep spindle density. However, this increase in spindle density was not dependent on the training condition. In other words, there was an increase in spindles regardless of how the rats were trained. EEG patterns showed {{a significant difference in the}} density of sleep spindles compared to the density of a control group of rats, who did not undergo any training before their sleep spindles were measured. This effect of increased spindle density only lasted for the first hour <b>into</b> <b>sleep</b> following training, and then disappeared within the second hour <b>into</b> <b>sleep.</b>|$|E
25|$|Coren's first widely {{recognized}} book outside of professional psychology circles was 1993's The Left-Hander Syndrome: {{the causes and}} consequences of left-handedness, which presented data on the significant challenges faced by left-handed people in society.

His next book was Sleep Thieves, the result of his studies <b>into</b> <b>sleep</b> and the lack of it. The book examined how the reduction of sleeping time in modern society has created problems of sleep deprivation for many people.|$|E

25|$|Treatment {{of sleep}} apnea via a {{continuous}} positive airway pressure (CPAP) device has shown dramatic improvement in apnea and nearly complete resolution of RMD symptoms. Behavioral interventions may alleviate some RMD symptoms and movements. In such a therapy, sufferers {{are asked to}} perform RMD-like motions during the day in a slow and methodic manner. In such, patients come short of full rhythmic movements that they experience in sleep. Such behavioral training {{has been shown to}} carry over <b>into</b> <b>sleep,</b> and the forcefulness of the RMD movements is reduced or eliminated. Hypnosis and sleep restriction have been used in some cases to good effect.|$|E
25|$|The usual {{technique}} for authorities, either public entities such as law enforcement or private organizations like companies, seizing a computer (usually a laptop) {{that they believe}} is being used improperly is to first physically separate the suspect user from the computer enough {{that he or she}} cannot touch it, to prevent them from closing its lid, unplugging it or typing a command. Once they have done so, they often install a device in the USB port that spoofs minor actions of a mouse, touchpad or keyboard, preventing the computer from going <b>into</b> <b>sleep</b> mode, from which it would usually return to a lock screen which would require a password. One program commonly used for this purpose is Mouse Jiggler.|$|E
25|$|In {{the first}} part of the ritual, the aides seek {{repeatedly}} both to arouse the ritualist sexually as well as to exhaust him. The ritualist is generally passive in this regard. There is disagreement over whether sexual arousal is enough, or sexual orgasm must be eventually accomplished. Crowley and others argue that orgasm must be avoided. Although later practitioners conclude that orgasm does not need to be avoided, that was how Crowley originally formulated the ritual. Most practitioners agree with Crowley that every means of arousal may be used, such as physical stimulation, genital stimulation, psychological stimulation, devices (such as sex toys), or drugs (an entheogen like hashish, marijuana, or other aphrodisiacs). There should be enough aides so that if one aide tires another may take his or her place. Eventually, the ritualist will tend to sink <b>into</b> <b>sleep</b> due to exhaustion.|$|E

25|$|The Tiangong-1 was {{launched}} September 2011 with an intended two year service span. After the last crew departed the module in June 2013 {{it was put}} <b>into</b> <b>sleep</b> mode and it was intended that it would remain in orbit for some time, allowing China {{to collect data on}} the longevity of key components before being commanded to gradually re-enter the atmosphere. On 21 March 2016 the Manned Space Engineering Office announced that they had disabled data service, since the space station had operated two and half years longer than its intended two-year service plan. According to the office, the space laboratory is under continued and close monitoring until it finally burns up in the earth atmosphere. Its orbit will descend gradually in the coming months, and the space laboratory will eventually be destroyed by heat in Earth's atmosphere between the October 2017 and April 2018 Harvard astrophysicist Jonathan McDowell, among others, told The Guardian that parts of the craft such as the rocket engines are probably too dense and tough to be burnt up upon re-entry and may result in chunks of debris up 100kg in weight falling to the Earth's surface, with little possibility of predicting where they may crash.|$|E
25|$|Another {{major change}} to the Start menu in Windows Vista is {{that it no longer}} {{presents}} the All programs menu as a horizontally expanding cascading list which utilizes the entire screen space, but instead as a nested folder view with a fixed size. The list of submenus and single items appears over the left column contents with a Back button below it. Subfolders expand and collapse vertically within the list when single-clicked, in a tree-like fashion similar to Windows Explorer. Single items appear at the top and folders appear at the bottom. Hovering the mouse over a folder does not open it; the folder needs to be clicked. A limitation of the new Start menu is that subfolders inside the All Programs menu cannot be opened simply by searching or double clicking. Also, as more programs are installed, a vertical scroll bar appears between the two columns. A dynamically changing icon showing the user's display picture by default is present {{at the top of the}} right column. It changes as users hover over any other item to reflect that item's icon. The Power button's action is configurable through Power options in the Control Panel, though the default setting is to put the computer <b>into</b> <b>Sleep</b> mode. Users can quickly lock their user account by pressing the Lock button. Additional power and account related actions are listed in a sub-menu which appears when the small arrow next to the Lock button is clicked.|$|E

Orfeo is now confronted with the ferryman Caronte, who {{addresses}} Orfeo harshly and refuses to take him across the river Styx. Orfeo attempts to persuade Caronte by singing a flattering song to him ("Mighty spirit and powerful divinity"), but the ferryman is unmoved. However, when Orfeo takes up his lyre and plays, Caronte is soothed <b>into</b> <b>sleep.</b> Seizing his chance, Orfeo steals the ferryman's boat and crosses the river, entering the Underworld while a chorus of spirits reflects that nature cannot defend herself against man: [...] "He has tamed the sea with fragile wood, and disdained the rage of the winds." ...|$|E

2500|$|Patricia Highsmith (January 19, 1921 â€“ February 4, 1995) was an American {{novelist and}} short story writer, {{known for her}} {{psychological}} thrillers, which led to {{more than two dozen}} film adaptations. Her first novel, Strangers on a Train, has been adapted for stage and screen numerous times, notably by Alfred Hitchcock in 1951. Highsmith wrote 22 novels, including her series of five novels with Tom Ripley as protagonist, and many short stories. Existentialism is the literary movement that most influenced her writing, with [...] "Dostoyevsky and Gide through Camus and Sartre" [...] among her favorite authors. Graham Greene described Highsmith as [...] "the poet of apprehension rather than fear. Fear after a time...is narcotic, it can lull one by fatigue <b>into</b> <b>sleep,</b> but apprehension nags at the nerves gently and inescapably." [...] Published under the pseudonym of [...] "Claire Morgan," [...] Highsmith wrote the first lesbian novel with a happy ending, The Price of Salt, republished 38 years later as Carol under her own name.|$|E

2500|$|In {{the second}} part of the ritual, the aides seek to come close to {{awakening}} the ritualist through sexual stimulation alone. The goal is not to fully awaken her or him, but rather to bring them to the brink of wakefulness. Not all authors agree that the ritualist seer will be in a state between sleep and wakefulness, instead noting that exhaustion will lead to a trance, or [...] "sleep of lucidity". The ritualist should be neither too tired or uncomfortable to aid in the trance-like state. Once the ritualist reaches a near-waking state, sexual stimulation must stop. The ritualist-seer is then permitted to sink back toward (but not <b>into)</b> <b>sleep.</b> [...] This step is repeated indefinitely until the ritualist reaches a state between sleep and wakefulness in which communing with a higher power may occur. Some say a goal during this time is to not become [...] "lost" [...] in the trance-like state, but to remain open without directing an outcome. The ritualist may also conduct spiritual work while in this state, or witness mystical events. Exhaustion may not be necessary for the ritualist who is [...] "bodily pure," [...] Crowley writes.|$|E
2500|$|In February 2014, {{during a}} Q session for the album, at SONOS Studios in Los Angeles, California, Schoolboy Q {{described}} the song [...] "Prescription/Oxymoron", {{as the most}} personal: [...] "I came up selling OxyContin," [...] he said. [...] "The karma behind it was that I never took an OxyContin before but I did get addicted to Percocets, Xanax, Codeineâ€”shit like that. When my daughter was one and two , I used to get <b>into</b> <b>sleep</b> comas, like 'Xan comas'â€”just dead {{to the world and}} I put it into the music." [...] Schoolboy Q said he arranged the song to juxtapose the process of selling prescription pills and addiction: [...] "I put the OxyContin and selling it {{at the end of the}} relapse or the addiction," [...] he said. [...] "I sold OxyContin and then I got addicted [...] This way, I showed that I got addicted then I sold it. That was a crazy record. That's true shitâ€”the first part of it when my daughter tried to wake me up and I was dead to the world. That was my little secret. I always had the cup with me. They just never knew I had a gang of pills in the other bottle. That was a little story about me and how I was addicted, too." ...|$|E
2500|$|During Jigglypuff's first {{appearance}} ("The Song of Jigglypuff"), {{it was found}} standing on a stump. Misty tried to capture it {{with the help of}} her Staryu, but felt bad when the Jigglypuff started crying. They soon realised that Jigglypuff was upset because it could not sing, and after a series of failed vocal exercises, Brock gave it a piece of fruit which soothed its throat. Now capable of singing, it performed for them, putting everyone within hearing range to sleep. This upset Jigglypuff, which angrily dug into Ash's backpack and pulled out a marker which it used to draw on the faces of everyone who fell asleep. Only on two occasions has Jigglypuff believed that anyone had heard its song to the end: in the first, Jigglypuff realizes that Misty's Psyduck was sleeping with its eyes open, and in the second ("A PokÃ©-Block Party"), a Whismur had heard the song the first time and stayed awake due to its Soundproof ability, but on the second time it was tired and fell asleep. In [...] "The Ancient Puzzle of PokÃ©mopolis", Jigglypuff sang to two gigantic PokÃ©mon battling each other, but these two PokÃ©mon did not fall asleep, and instead Jigglypuff was knocked away by the energy of their battle. In the PokÃ©mon short Pikachu's Exploration Club, Jigglypuff is parodied by a Marill, which, in the same fashion, puffs up angrily after putting its audience <b>into</b> <b>sleep</b> with its song. In PokÃ©mon Chronicles, Marina has a Jigglypuff, but when the Jigglypuff uses Sing, people are not affected in part because of Beedrill, whose beating wings are too loud.|$|E
