5|$|The longest living eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> was {{a captive}} {{specimen}} which lived for 18.8 years. Another captive specimen lived for 14 years. However, {{while it may}} be possible for wild specimens to live that long, they are thought to have shorter lifespans in general due to the threats of predation, habitat loss, disease, and other biological and environmental factors.|$|E
5|$|As of June 26, 2011, the {{conservation}} status of Dendroaspis angusticeps {{has not been}} assessed by the IUCN. The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> is, however, a fairly common species of snake throughout its geographical range, and populations {{are believed to be}} stable. Large concentrations of two to three individuals per hectare have been documented in coastal Kenya and southern Tanzania, and in one instance a group of five eastern green mambas were seen in a single tree. Although populations of this species are stable, habitat destruction and deforestation may pose a possible threat to this species.|$|E
50|$|The {{three species}} of <b>green</b> <b>mambas</b> are arboreal, whereas the black mamba is largely terrestrial. All four species are active diurnal hunters, preying on birds, lizards, and small mammals. At nightfall some species, {{especially}} the terrestrial black mamba, shelter in a lair. A mamba may retain the same lair for years.|$|R
50|$|The western <b>green</b> <b>mamba's</b> natural prey {{consists}} {{mainly of}} birds and small mammals, including rodents such as mice, rats, and squirrels. Other mammals include bats, tree pangolins, and shrews. They also feed on lizards, frogs, and bird eggs. This snake pursues its prey, striking rapidly and often until the prey succumbs to the venom.|$|R
5|$|This {{species is}} {{indigenous}} to more coastal regions of southern Africa and east Africa. The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba's</b> range extends from Kenya south through Tanzania, Mozambique, Malawi, eastern Zimbabwe, eastern Zambia into South Africa {{as far as}} southern Natal and northern Pondoland. It {{can also be found}} in Zanzibar. The distribution of this species is assumed to be continuous, but reports seem to be scarce in regions within the species' range.|$|R
5|$|Like other mambas {{the eastern}} <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> {{is a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both neurotoxins and cardiotoxins. The toxicity of individual specimens can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat and convulsions progressing to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal.|$|E
5|$|The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> is {{a highly}} venomous snake. The venom {{consists}} of both pre-synaptic and postsynaptic neurotoxins (dendrotoxins), cardiotoxins, calcicludine, and fasciculins. The average venom yield per bite is 80mg according to Engelmann and Obst (1981), while Minton (1974) gives it a range of 60–95mg (dry weight). The subcutaneous LD50 is 1.3mg/kg. The LD50 in mice through the IV route is 0.45mg/kg. Like all other mamba species, the toxicity of individual specimens within the same species can vary greatly based on several factors including geographical region, age, seasonal variation, diet, and so on. Local swelling is variable and sometimes absent after mamba bites. However, patients bitten by the eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> develop swelling of the entire bitten limb and also show mild haemostatic disturbances (Warrell DA; MacKay et al. 1966). The rare cases of local tissue damage usually resulted from bites on the fingers {{or the use of}} a tight tourniquet. This species has caused bites to humans and many of the bites attributed to this species have often resulted in fatalities. The mortality rate of untreated bites is unknown but is thought to be quite high. Symptoms of envenomation by this species include swelling of the bite site, dizziness, and nausea, accompanied by difficulty breathing and swallowing, irregular heartbeat, convulsions, rapid progression to respiratory paralysis. Bites that produce severe envenomation can be rapidly fatal. Case reports of rapidly fatal outcomes, in as little as 30 minutes, have been recorded for this species.|$|E
5|$|This mamba preys {{primarily}} on adult birds, eggs and rodents. This species {{has also been}} documented to prey on bats. It is also believed that this species eats arboreal lizards as well, but {{this has not been}} documented. The preliminary evidence suggests that this species displays a sit-and-wait strategy of foraging. However, this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species. One witness observed a specimen systematically hunt sleeping bats (J. Ashe, pers. comm. 1991). They have also been known to raid the nests of young birds. Sit-and-wait tactics may be successful with highly mobile prey, such as adult birds or rodents. Documented prey include the sombre greenbul, which occur in dense portions of natural and cultivated vegetation along Kenya's coastline. Ionides and Pitman (1965) reported a large Bushveld gerbil in the stomach of a <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> in Tanzania. Although the Bushveld gerbil does not occur in Kenya, green mambas will prey on any of the seven species of gerbil that inhabit various portions of its range.|$|E

40|$|Mambas (genus Dendroaspis) {{are among}} the most feared of the {{medically}} important elapid snakes found in sub-Saharan Africa, but many facets of their biology, including the diversity of venom composition, remain relatively understudied. Here, we present a reconstruction of mamba phylogeny, alongside genus-wide venom gland transcriptomic and high-resolution top-down venomic analyses. Whereas the <b>green</b> <b>mambas,</b> D. viridis, D. angusticeps, D. j. jamesoni and D. j. kaimosae, express 3 FTx-predominant venoms, black mamba (D. polylepis) venom is dominated by dendrotoxins I and K. The divergent terrestrial ecology of D. polylepis compared to the arboreal niche occupied by all other mambas makes it plausible that this major difference in venom composition is due to dietary variation. The pattern of intrageneric venom variability across Dendroaspis represented a valuable opportunity to investigate, in a genus-wide context, the variant toxicity of the venom, and the degree of paraspecific cross-reactivity between antivenoms and mamba venoms. To this end, the immunological profiles of the five mamba venoms were assessed against a panel of commercial antivenoms generated for the sub-Saharan Africa market. This study provides a genus-wide overview of which available antivenoms may be more efficacious in neutralising human envenomings caused by mambas, irrespective of the species responsible. The information gathered in this study lays the foundations for rationalising the notably different potency and pharmacological profiles of Dendroaspis venoms at locus resolution. This understanding will allow selection and design of toxin immunogens with a view to generating a safer and more efficacious pan-specific antivenom against any mamba envenomation...|$|R
40|$|Exotic (foreign or non-native) snakes, {{including}} venomous species, {{are becoming}} increasingly popular pets in Western countries. Some of them are kept illegally (as defined by the UK Dangerous Wild Animals Act of 1976). There is a large international market for such animals, with contraventions of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species of Wild Fauna and Flora (CITES). In the UK, several other European countries and the USA the reported numbers of bites by venomous exotic snakes, although small, are increasing but still underestimate the occurrence of these occasionally fatal events because of the victims' reluctance to seek medical care. Victims are predominantly young {{men who have been}} drinking alcohol. Bites may be intentionally provoked. In Europe, the species most often involved are cobras, <b>green</b> <b>mambas,</b> American pit vipers particularly rattlesnakes, African adders, vipers and Asian green pit vipers. To illustrate the special problems involved, case histories are presented of bites by exotic species in the UK and of bites abroad, where patients were repatriated for treatment. In view of the relative rarity and diversity of these cases, expert advice must usually be sought. These requests should include information about the species thought to have been responsible and the history and timing of the evolution of envenoming. Sources of advice and antivenom are discussed together with recommendations for appropriate first aid and emergency treatment while this is being awaited. Respiratory and cardiovascular resuscitation may be required and when systemic or severe local envenoming develops, specific (equine or ovine) antivenom is indicated...|$|R

500|$|The {{specific}} name angusticeps {{is derived from}} the Latin word angustus, which means [...] "narrow" [...] and -ceps is also Latin and {{is derived from the}} word [...] "cephalicus" [...] which means [...] "head" [...] or [...] "of or relating to the head", calling attention to the long narrow head of this species. In addition to being called the eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba,</b> this species is also commonly known as the common <b>green</b> <b>mamba,</b> East African <b>green</b> <b>mamba,</b> white-mouthed mamba, or just simply the <b>green</b> <b>mamba.</b>|$|E
500|$|The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> (Dendroaspis angusticeps), {{also known}} as the common mamba, East African <b>green</b> <b>mamba,</b> <b>green</b> <b>mamba,</b> or white-mouthed mamba, is a large, tree-dwelling, highly venomous snake species of the mamba genus Dendroaspis. This species of mamba was first {{described}} by a Scottish surgeon and zoologist in 1849. This snake mostly inhabits the coastal regions of southern East Africa. Adult females average approximately [...] in length, and males are slightly smaller. Eastern green mambas prey on birds, eggs, bats, and rodents such as mice, rats, and gerbils. They are shy and elusive snakes which are rarely seen, making them somewhat unusual among mambas, and elapids in general. This elusiveness is usually attributed to the species' green colouration which blends with its environment, and its arboreal lifestyle. However, eastern green mambas have also been observed to use [...] "sit-and-wait" [...] or ambush predation like many vipers, unlike the active foraging style typical of other elapids, which may be a factor in the rarity of sightings.|$|E
50|$|Reptiles can be locally {{important}} in the diet, and they are known to take larger numbers of reptiles than other large African booted eagles. Only relatively large reptiles, it seems, are attacked and many of this prey is also potentially dangerous, so a great majority time such prey is taken in ambushes. In particular, in the former Transvaal province of northeastern South Africa, reptiles were the main prey, with monitor lizards alone comprising just under half of the prey remains. The monitors attacked may include the 6.1 kg rock monitor (Varanus albigularis), the 5.25 kg nile monitor (Varanus niloticus) and the 1.02 kg savannah monitor (Varanus exanthematicus). These monitors, the largest lizards in Africa, are formidable prey and almost all attacks are ambushes on adult monitors by mature female eagles. Sometimes a lengthy struggle will ensue as the eagles {{try to get a}} good grip into the tough back skin of the monitors while simultaneously trying to control their necks to avoid the prey’s powerful jaws, however the eagles are usually successful in dispatching the large lizards. Reptiles as a whole made up 38% of the prey remains from Kruger National Park. These consisted of monitor lizards as well as wide range of venomous snakes, including Cape cobras (Naja nivea), boomslangs (Dispholidus typus), puff adders (Bitis arietans), the eastern (Dendroaspis angusticeps) and western <b>green</b> <b>mambas</b> (Dendroaspis viridis), and even black mambas (Dendroaspis polylepis), these species ranging in size from the 0.3 kg boomslang to the 1.6 kg black mamba. Also taken here were the non-venomous but already sizeable youngsters of the African rock python (Python sebae), the largest African snake. Elsewhere, snouted cobras (Naja annulifera) may added to the list of their prey spectrum. A surprising number of tortoises and turtles are also taken by martial eagles, ranging from one of the smallest tortoises, the 0.23 kg greater padloper (Homopus femoralis) to the one of the largest, the 10.8 kg leopard tortoise (Stigmochelys pardalis) (though probably only small specimens of the latter species are taken of this, the second largest tortoise on mainland Africa). In one case, an estimated 90 cm nile crocodile (Crocodylus niloticus) was captured and flown with by a martial eagle.|$|R
500|$|The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> is {{classified}} under the genus Dendroaspis {{of the family}} Elapidae. Dendroaspis angusticeps was first described by a Scottish surgeon and zoologist, Dr. Andrew Smith in 1849.|$|E
500|$|The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> is a large, with a {{slightly}} compressed, and very slender bodied snake with a medium to moderately long tapering tail. Adult males average around [...] in total length, while females average [...] in total length. This species rarely exceeds lengths of [...] In general, the total length is 4-4.3 times {{the length of the}} tail. The head is narrow, elongate, and coffin-shaped with a distinct canthus and slightly distinct from the neck. When threatened or otherwise aroused in some way, this species is capable of flattening its neck area, though no real hood formed. The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> has relatively long front fangs located at proscenium end of the maxillary bone at the very front of the maxilla, which can rotate at its axis with the prefrontal bone, giving this species more control of the movements of their fangs, unlike other elapids. The maxillary bone has no other solid teeth. However, a pair of long, recurved, fang-like solid teeth, followed behind by a distinct interspace and numerous small teeth are {{on the front of the}} lower jaw. Their eyes are medium in size with round pupils.|$|E
500|$|The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> is a diurnal, arboreal, and secretive {{species of}} snake, and {{it tends to}} spend most of its time above the ground in {{relatively}} dense brush, where it is well camouflaged. This species is not commonly found on land unless motivated by thirst, prey, or the need to bask in the sun (thermoregulation). It is an alert, nervous, excellent climber and extremely agile snake. It sleeps at night in a tree coiled up in leafy clumps rather than seeking a tree hollow (although sometimes found in them). In a study of the movement patterns of two adult specimens of this species over a 27-day period, the researcher found that their activity range areas to be very low, comparable to other predators who ambush prey rather than actively hunt them. This is in contrast to most elapid species, including other mambas, who tend to actively hunt or forage for prey. The study's preliminary evidence sheds some light on this species' method of hunting prey and suggests that it may be an ambush predator due to the sit-and-wait behavior displayed. However, this evidence does not preclude active foraging by this species. A specimen systematically hunting a sleeping bat was observed by William York. There {{is no evidence that the}} eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> migrates; in fact, this species is thought to be relatively sedentary. It can remain in the same location for days at a time, apparently moving most commonly to find food or mates. On average, individuals of this species move only about [...] per day. Unlike its much larger cousin the black mamba, this mamba is more shy and not as aggressive or fearsome. It will avoid confrontation with humans or any other potential predators when possible, and will rather rely on its camouflage, or flee, than alert a potential threat of its presence. They are fast snakes, capable of moving 7mph. They don't always strike, but under continuous harassment and provocation and especially if cornered, they may suddenly strike repeatedly in quick succession, often leading to severe envenomation.|$|E
500|$|The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> is {{primarily}} arboreal (living in trees), only rarely descending to the ground. An elusive snake {{due to its}} coloration, it is usually well camouflaged in trees or bushes. It is believed by some herpetologists that this species is limited to tropical rainforests in coastal lowlands, however, according to other experts, this species {{can also be found}} in coastal bush, and dune and montane forest. Unlike its close relative the black mamba (D. polylepis), this species is rarely found in open terrain and prefers relatively dense, well-shaded vegetation. In addition to wild forest habitats, this species is also commonly found in thickets and farm trees (such as citrus, mango, coconut, and cashew). In coastal east Africa they are known to enter houses and may even shelter in thatched roof dwellings. Specimens of this species have been found at elevations up to [...] above sea level.|$|E
500|$|The {{black mamba}} (Dendroaspis polylepis) is an elapid within the genus Dendroaspis. Although {{it had been}} known to missionaries and residents, before 1860, by the name [...] "mamba", which was already {{established}} in the vernacular and taken from the Zulu word [...] "imamba", the first formal description was made by German-British zoologist Albert Günther in 1864. A single specimen {{was one of many}} snake species collected by Dr John Kirk, a naturalist who accompanied Dr David Livingstone on the Second Zambesi expedition. In 1873, German naturalist Wilhelm Peters described Dendraspis Antinorii from a specimen in the museum of Genoa, which had been killed by Orazio Antinori in what is now northern Eritrea. This was subsequently regarded as a subspecies, but is no longer held to be distinct. In 1896, George Albert Boulenger combined the species (Dendroaspis polylepis) as a whole with the eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> (Dendroaspis angusticeps), a lumping diagnosis that remained in force until 1946, when FitzSimons split them again into separate species.|$|E
500|$|The eastern <b>green</b> <b>mamba</b> is solitary, {{except during}} {{breeding}} season, {{when they are}} most active and males engage in combat and males and females mate. Gravid females tend to be sedentary, but males will actively search out and court females during the long rainy season, which is between the months of April and June. Males have been observed engaging in agonistic behaviour and may fight each other over potential mating opportunities, or possibly to establish a dominance hierarchy. Typically, a male initiates a fight by moving {{on top of the}} other’s body and tongue-flicking, after which the two snakes “intertwine their necks and bodies, and push against each other” in an attempt to pin each other's head repeatedly to the ground. Male-male combat can last for several hours, but combat between males of this species don't ever include biting {{and the nature of the}} combat is never as aggressive and/or vicious as commonly seen among the eastern green mamba's much larger cousin, the black mamba. Males locate females by following a scent trail. The male courts the female by aligning his body along the female’s while rapidly tongue-flicking. Depending on whether the female is receptive to mating, she will lift her tail and cloacal juxtaposition will follow shortly. Courtship and mating take place in the trees, after which the female lays anywhere between 4-17 eggs (average of 10 to 15 eggs are laid), which occurs in the summer months of October and November. The eggs are white and elongated, usually measuring 65x35 millimetres. The eggs are usually laid in a hollow tree, among decaying vegetation, or leaf litter. The incubation period is 10 to 12 weeks. When the young emerge from the eggs, they are approximately [...] or around an average of [...] in length, and they're highly venomous right at birth.
