5|$|RAF Fighter Command {{claims against}} the British main opponents in 1941 and 1942—Jagdgeschwader 26 (Fighter Wing 26) and Jagdgeschwader 2 (Fighter Wing 2) —are very {{difficult}} to verify. Only two of the 30 volumes of War Diaries produced by JG 26 survived the war. Historian Donald Caldwell has attempted to use what limited German material is available to compare losses and air victory claims but acknowledges the lack of sources leave the possibility <b>for</b> <b>error.</b> From June 1941 to the spring, 1942, Fighter Command claimed 711 enemy aircraft while losing 411. According to available German records, the loss to JG 2 and JG 26 were reportedly 103.|$|E
5|$|Both HDMI and DVI use TMDS to send 10-bit {{characters}} that are encoded using 8b/10b encoding that {{differs from the}} original IBM form for the Video Data Period and 2b/10b encoding for the Control Period. HDMI adds the ability to send audio and auxiliary data using 4b/10b encoding for the Data Island Period. Each Data Island Period is 32 pixels in size and contains a 32-bit Packet Header, which includes 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data <b>for</b> <b>error</b> correction and describes {{the contents of the}} packet. Each packet contains four subpackets, and each subpacket is 64 bits in size, including 8 bits of BCH ECC parity data, allowing for each packet to carry up to 224 bits of audio data. Each Data Island Period can contain up to 18 packets. Seven of the 15 packet types described in the HDMI 1.3a specifications deal with audio data, while the other 8 types deal with auxiliary data. Among these are the General Control Packet and the Gamut Metadata Packet. The General Control Packet carries information on AVMUTE (which mutes the audio during changes that may cause audio noise) and Color Depth (which sends the bit depth of the current video stream and is required for deep color). The Gamut Metadata Packet carries information on the color space being used for the current video stream and is required for xvYCC.|$|E

25|$|The {{process is}} subject to both burst errors and random errors. Burst errors include those due to disc {{material}} (defects of aluminum reflecting film, poor reflective index of transparent disc material), disc production (faults during disc forming and disc cutting etc.), disc handling (scratches – generally thin, radial and orthogonal to direction of recording) and variations in play-back mechanism. Random errors include those due to jitter of reconstructed signal wave and interference in signal. CIRC (Cross-Interleaved Reed–Solomon code) is the basis <b>for</b> <b>error</b> detection and correction in the CD process. It corrects error bursts up to 3,500 bits in sequence (2.4nbsp&mm in length as seen on CD surface) and compensates <b>for</b> <b>error</b> bursts up to 12,000 bits (8.5nbsp&mm) that {{may be caused by}} minor scratches.|$|E

25|$|BITS {{includes}} a built-in mechanism <b>for</b> <b>error</b> handling and recovery attempts. Errors {{can be either}} fatal or transient; either moves a job to the respective state.

25|$|In {{recent years}} new {{contributing}} factors were considered after reviewing accidents involving solo diving, diving with incapable dive partners, video or photography in caves, complex cave dives and cave diving in large groups.

25|$|For example, a PID loop is used {{to control}} the {{temperature}} of an electric resistance furnace where the system has stabilized. Now when the door is opened and something cold is put into the furnace the temperature drops below the setpoint. The integral function of the controller tends to compensate <b>for</b> <b>error</b> by introducing another error in the positive direction. This overshoot can be avoided by freezing of the integral function after {{the opening of the}} door for the time the control loop typically needs to reheat the furnace.|$|E
25|$|The {{original}} standard {{provides a}} mono spaced 40×24 character grid. Characters are sent using a 7-bit codec, with an 8th bit employed <b>for</b> <b>error</b> detection. The standard was improved in 1976 {{to allow for}} improved appearance {{and the ability to}} individually select the color of each character from a palette of 8. The proposed higher resolution Level 2 (1981) was not adopted in Britain (in-vision services from Ceefax & ORACLE did use it at various times however, though even this was ceased by the BBC in 1996), although transmission rates were doubled from two to four lines a frame.|$|E
25|$|Bayesian {{inference}} is {{the method}} that many have argued {{is the most}} accurate. In general, Bayesian statistical methods allow investigators to combine pre-existing information with new hypothesis. In the case of evolution, it combines {{the likelihood of the}} data observed with the likelihood that the events happened in the order they did, while recognizing the potential <b>for</b> <b>error</b> and uncertainty. Overall, it is the most accurate method for reconstructing ancestral genetic sequences, as well as protein stability. Unlike the other two methods, Bayesian inference yields a distribution of possible trees, allowing for more accurate and easily interpretable estimates of the variance of possible outcomes.|$|E
