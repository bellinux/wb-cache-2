40|$|The author surveys {{agricultural}} reform to date, identifies key policy issues, and outlines potential scenarios for {{the transformation of}} agriculture in Bulgaria, Czechoslovakia, the former German Democratic Republic (GDR), Hungary, Poland, Romania, {{and to a lesser}} extent - the former USSR. After years of socialism, these countries'agricultural sectors are characterized by large, inefficient farms with high production costs; heavier food consumption than in market economies of comparable prosperity, and excess demand for food, at subsidized food prices. Central Eastern Europe is beginning to create a new agricultural structure based on private ownership, real cooperatives, and a market economy. The former USSR is also striving to overcome serious economic difficulty with comprehensive economic and political reform. To develop a market-oriented, competitive agricultural structure, these countries need to : a) create marketable landed property; b) change agriculture's structure to emphasize medium size private agricultural ventures and cooperatives; c) create an environment supportive of private ventures; <b>d)</b> <b>create</b> <b>an</b> agricultural market that encourages fair competition; e) develop a policy emphasizing efficient production; and f) support environmentally sustainable agricultural production technologies.

The present theoretical interpretation characterized the encounter with hospital clowns as a magical safe area, an intermediate area between fantasy and reality.

Semistructured interviews produced rich narratives, which uncovered numerous sociostructural stressors in men’s lives, such as racism, incarceration, and unemployment.

40|$|The {{aviation}} industry has set ambitious goals to reduce carbon emissions in coming decades. The strategy {{involves the use}} of sustainable biofuels, aiming to achieve benefits from environmental, social, and economic perspectives.

This paper presents the main conclusions and recommendations from a broad assessment of the technological, economic, and sustainability challenges and opportunities associated with the development of drop-in aviation biofuels in Brazil. It was written by a research team that prepared the initial reports and conducted eight workshops with the active participation of more than 30 stakeholders encompassing the private sector, government institutions, NGOs, and academia.

40|$|Debates {{about the}} {{appropriate}} role, policies, {{and institutions of}} the state are often hampered {{by the lack of}} a definition for good government. To provide a quantifiable measure of good government, the authors develop an index for the quality of governance for a sample of 80 countries. They apply the index to the debate on the appropriate level of fiscal decentralization. In measuring the quality of governance, the authors develop indices for the government's ability to: a) Ensure political transparency and a voice for all citizens (the citizen participation index measures political freedom and political stability). b) Provide effective public services efficiently (the government orientation index measures judicial and bureaucratic efficiency and the absence of corruption). c) Promote {{the health and well-being of}} its citizens (the social development index measures human development and equitable distribution of income). <b>d)</b> <b>Create</b> <b>a</b> favorable climate for stable economic growth (the economic management index measures outward orientation, independence of the central bank, and an inverted debt-to-GDP ratio).

40|$|The {{high rate}} of teacher {{attrition}} in urban schools is well documented. While this does not seem like a problem in Carter County, this equates to hundreds of teachers {{that need to be}} replaced annually. Since school year (SY) 2007 - 08, Carter County has lost over 7, 100 teachers, approximately half of (50. 1 %) of whom resigned, often going to neighboring, higher-paying jurisdictions as suggested by exit survey data (SY 2016 - 2020 Strategic Plan). Included in this study is a range of practices principals use to retain teachers. While the role of the principal is recognized as a critical element in teacher retention, few studies explore the specific practices principals implement to retain teachers and how they use their time to accomplish this task. Through interviews, observations, document analysis and reflective notes, the study identifies the practices four elementary school principals of high and relatively low attrition schools use to support teacher retention. In doing so, the study uses a qualitative cross-case analysis approach. The researcher examined the following leadership practices of the principal and their impact on teacher retention: (a) providing leadership, (b) supporting new teachers, (c) training and mentoring teaching staff, (<b>d)</b> <b>creating</b> opportunities for collaboration, (<b>d)</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> positive school climate, and (e) promoting teacher autonomy.

[...] Boston UniversityThe {{purpose of}} this study was to examine a high school choral program to {{discover}} how the leadership behaviors of the teacher contributed to the success of the program. The teacher's leadership behaviors were examined through the framework of Transformational Leadership. Criteria for the selection of this program included a recent performance at a state music conference, consistent high ratings at choral performance evaluations, and the inclusion of one chorus where students continued to sing but did not audition into the top chorus. Primary participants included student members in the three choruses and their director. Secondary participants included the orchestra director and the choral director from the feeder middle school. Data were collected through interviews, observations ofrehearsals and concerts, and artifacts during one academic year of instruction. Data were coded and analyzed and primary themes included: (a) a supportive classroom atmosphere; (b) repertoire selection; (c) developing independent musicians; and (<b>d)</b> <b>creating</b> <b>a</b> chorus community. Results ofthis study indicate that the director demonstrated numerous leadership behaviors that intersect with those found in Transformational Leadership. These included: setting clear, challenging goals; holding high expectations for music reading and performance; providing support in a friendly classroom environment; establishing a sense of community in the chorus; and, genuinely caring for the needs of students. These transformative leadership behaviors led to students who demonstrated musical independence. Suggestions for the profession include implementing transformational leadership behaviors into undergraduate music education courses, which can provide opportunities for preservice teachers to reflect upon and develop their leadership skills to a higher level before they enter the profession...|$|R
