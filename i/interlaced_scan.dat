It was {{launched}} on October 3, 2015 initially on Sky Cable and Destiny Cable HD digital subscribers {{and later on}} I Want TV, Sky On Demand, and Sky Direct. Its resolution is 1080i (1,920x1,080 pixels <b>interlaced</b> <b>scan</b> and aspect ratio of 16:9) at 30 fields per second.|$|E
50|$|The lower resolutions {{can operate}} either in {{progressive}} scan or interlaced mode, {{but not the}} largest picture sizes. The 1080-line system does not support progressive images at the highest frame rates of 50, 59.94 or 60 frames per second, because such technology was seen as too advanced at the time. The standard also requires 720-line video be progressive scan, since that provides better picture quality than <b>interlaced</b> <b>scan</b> at a given frame rate, {{and there was no}} legacy use of <b>interlaced</b> <b>scan</b> for that format. The result is that the combination of maximum frame rate and picture size results in the same maximum number of samples per second for both the 1080-line interlaced format and the 720-line format, as 1980*1080*30 is equal to 1280*720*60. A similar equality relationship applies for 576 lines at 25 frame per second versus 480 lines at 30 frames per second.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Interlaced</b> <b>scan</b> {{refers to}} one of two common methods for [...] "painting" [...] a video image on an {{electronic}} display screen (the other being progressive scan) by scanning or displaying each line or row of pixels. This technique uses two fields to create a frame. One field contains all odd-numbered lines in the image; the other contains all even-numbered lines.|$|E
30|$|Since <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> uses just {{one-half}} of a frame {{at any given}} time, the video quality is worse compared to that for progressive <b>scanning.</b> Further, <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> has horizontal jagged noise due to weaving of the two fields. The spatial quality of <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> may be worse than that of progressive scanning, however, the temporal resolution is {{higher than that of}} progressive scanning. Also, it consumes only {{one-half of}} the bandwidth compared to {{that in the case of}} progressive scanning. Further, cathode ray tube (CRT)-based televisions cannot adopt the progressive scanning mode owing to their technical limitations. Thus, <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> is still widely used in various television encoding systems and camcorder recording modes, in spite of unavoidable shortcomings. Standard definition television (SDTV) uses one of the three analog television encoding standards known as NTSC, PAL, and SECAM. All of them use <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning.</b> In the case of camcorders, both scanning modes are supported during recording, but <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> is set as the default scanning mode in most camcorders.|$|R
5000|$|The {{scanning}} system: progressive <b>scanning</b> (p) or <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> (i). Progressive scanning (p) redraws {{an image}} frame (all of its lines) when refreshing each image, for example 720p/1080p. <b>Interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> (i) draws the image field every other line or [...] "odd numbered" [...] lines {{during the first}} image refresh operation, and then draws the remaining [...] "even numbered" [...] lines during a second refreshing, for example 1080i. <b>Interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> yields greater image resolution if subject is not moving, but loses {{up to half of}} the resolution and suffers [...] "combing" [...] artifacts when subject is moving.|$|R

The second pass displays the second and all even numbered lines, filling in the gaps in the first scan.|$|E
50|$|Historically, video frames were {{represented}} as analog waveforms in which varying voltages represented {{the intensity of}} light in an analog raster scan across the screen. Analog blanking intervals separated video frames {{in the same way}} that frame lines did in film. For historical reasons, most systems used an <b>interlaced</b> <b>scan</b> system in which the frame typically consisted of two video fields sampled over two slightly different periods of time. This meant that a single video frame was usually not a good still picture of the scene, unless the scene being shot was completely still.|$|E
50|$|Note: Because the {{refresh rate}} has been slowed {{down by a}} factor of three, and the {{resolution}} is less than half a resolution of a typical interlaced video, the flicker in the simulated interlaced portions and also the visibility of the black lines in these examples are exaggerated.

5000|$|Within the {{designation}} [...] "1080i", the i stands for <b>interlaced</b> <b>scan.</b> A frame of 1080i video {{consists of two}} sequential fields of 1920 horizontal and 540 vertical pixels. The first field consists of all odd-numbered TV lines and the second all even numbered lines. Consequently, the horizontal lines of pixels in each field are captured and displayed with a one-line vertical gap between them, so {{the lines of the}} next field can be interlaced between them, resulting in 1080 total lines. 1080i differs from 1080p, where the p stands for progressive scan, where all lines in a frame are captured at the same time. In native or pure 1080i, the two fields of a frame correspond to different instants (points in time), so motion portrayal is good (50 or 60 motion phases/second). This is true for interlaced video in general and can be easily observed in still images taken of fast motion scenes. However, when 1080p material is captured at 25 or 30 frames/second, it is converted to 1080i at 50 or 60 fields/second, respectively, for processing or broadcasting. In this situation both fields in a frame do correspond to the same instant. The field-to-instant relation is somewhat more complex for the case of 1080p at 24 frames/second converted to 1080i at 60 fields/second.|$|E

40|$|In {{the early}} days of {{television}} as Cathode Ray Tube (CRT) screens became brighter, the level of flicker caused by progressive scanning became more noticeable. This is because the human visual system is sensitive to large-area flicker. <b>Interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> was invented in 1932 as a redeem to this difficulty. In contrast to progressive scanning, where every line is drawn in sequence, <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> alternates lines of a frame in half a frame interval, called a field. The conversion process from <b>interlace</b> <b>scan</b> to progressive scan is called deinterlacing. In this thesis, two deinterlacing methods, which use motion information from the video sequence, were used in conjunction to obtain an improved result. Thus, the process of finding the true motion on the interlaced video sequence also had to be analyzed. The analysis was done on artificially generated test sequences, as well as true video sequences. The result was measured using the Mean Square Error between a progressive input sequence and the deinterlaced output sequence. This measurement was compared to a much simpler deinterlacing algorithm and showed large improvements, primarily in sense of aliasing. However, in some cases, the deinterlacer produced severe artifacts causing picture degradation. Validerat; 20101217 (root...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a CMOS image sensor which can implement the charge domain interlacing principle. Inspired by the shared amplifier pixel structure {{and based on}} a pinned photodiode four transistor (4 T) structure, two innovative pixel designs combined with two different readout directions are presented. These novel pixels are designed to fit the charge domain interlacing principle, which used the charge binning technology in the field integration mode of <b>interlaced</b> <b>scan</b> to improve the signal-to-noise ratio of the sensor. To realize this working principle and compared it with other working modes, a programmable universal image sensor peripheral circuit is designed for controlling and driving the pixel array in the most flexible and most efficient way. As a result, the designed sensor can be used {{not only in the}} progressive scan mode, frame integration <b>interlaced</b> <b>scan,</b> and voltage domain interlacing mode but also in the charge domain interlacing mode. This is a very unique feature for CMOS image sensors, and without the shared pixel concept, charge domain interlacing was only possible with CCDs.

In fact, <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> can be looked at as the first video compression model as it was partly designed in the 1940s to double the image resolution to exceed the limitations of the television broadcast bandwidth. Another reason for its adoption was to limit the flickering on early CRT screens whose phosphor coated screens could only retain the image from the electron scanning gun for a relatively short duration.

40|$|<b>Interlaced</b> versus {{progressive}} <b>scanning</b> is {{an important}} issue when dealing with digital television. Not only because the change from analog to digital communication may be seen as an opportunity to move to other formats, but also because of the well-known artifacts of <b>interlaced</b> <b>scanning</b> (interline twitter, line crawling, and field aliasing) compared to the natural way of representing two-dimensional images as the progressive format does. However, digital broadcasting has to face the problem of transmitting twice the number of pels of the progressive format.

Nowadays digital television is prevailing in China, and the government is promoting the popularity of digital television. However, because of the economic development, analog television will still take its place in the TV market during a long period. But the broadcasting system has not been reformed, as a result, we should not only take use of the traditional analog system we already have, but also improve the quality of the pictures of analog system. With the high-speed development of high-end television, the research and application of digital television technique, the flaws caused by <b>interlaced</b> <b>scan</b> in traditional analog television, such as color-crawling, flicker and fast-moved object's boundary blur and zigzag, are more and more obvious. Therefore the conversion of <b>interlaced</b> <b>scan</b> to progressing scan, which is de-interlacing, {{is an important part of}} current television production. At present there are many kinds of TV sets appearing in the market. They are based on digital processing technology and use various digital methods to process the interlaced, low-field rate video data, including the de-interlacing and field rate conversion. The digital process chip of television is the heart of the new-fashioned TV set, and is the reason of visual quality improvement. As a requirement of real time television signal processing, most of these chips has developed novel hardware architecture or data processing algorithm. So far, the most quality effective algorithm is based on motion compensation, in which motion detection and motion estimation will be inevitably involved, in despite of the high computation cost. in video processing chips, the performance and complexity of motion estimation algorithm have a direct impact on speed area and power consumption of chips. Also, motion estimation determined the efficiency of the coding algorithms in video compression. This thesis proposes a Down-sampled Diamond NTSS algorithm (DSD-NTSS) based on New Three Step Search (NTSS) algorithm, taking both performance and complexity of motion estimation algorithms into consideration. The proposed DSD-NTSS algorithm makes use of the similarity of neighboring pixels in the same image and down-samples pixels in the reference blocks with the decussate pattern to reduce the computation cost. Experiment results show that DSD-NTSS is a better tradeoff in the terms of performance and complexity. The proposed DSD-NTSS reduces the computation cost by half compared with NTSS when having the equivalent image quality. Further compared with Four Step Search(FSS) Diamond Search(DS) 、Three Step Search(TSS) and some other fast searching algorithms, the proposed DSD-NTSS generally surpasses in performance and complexity.
