40|$|Mass-customization is a {{megatrend}} {{that also}} affects the wood industry. To obtain individually designed laminates in batch size one efficient printing and processing technologies are required. Digital printing was envisaged {{as it does}} not depend on highly costly printing cylinders (as used in rotogravure printing) and allows rapid exchange of the printing designs. In the present work, two wellestablished digital printing approaches, the multi-pass and the single-pass technique, were investigated and evaluated for their applicability in decorating engineered wood and low-pressure melamine films. Three different possibilities of implementing digital printing in the decorative laminates manufacturing process were studied: (1) digital printing on coated chipboard and subsequently applying a lacquered top-coat or melamine overlay (designated as “direct printing”, since the LPM was the printing substrate), (2) digital printing on decorative paper which was subsequently impregnated before hot pressing (designated as “indirect printing, variant A”) and (3) digital printing on decorative paper with subsequent interlamination of the paper between impregnated under- and overlay paper layers during the pressing process (designated as “indirect printing, variant B”). Due to various advantages of the resulting cured melamine resin surfaces including a much better technological performance and flexibility in surface texture design, it was decided to industrially further pursue only the indirect digital printing process comprising interlamination and the <b>direct</b> <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> with a melamine overlay-finishing. Basis for the successful trials on production and laboratory scales were the identification of applicable inks (in terms of compatibility with melamine resin) and of appropriate printing paper quality (in terms of impregnation and imprinting ability). After selection and fine tuning of suitable materials, the next challenge to overcome was the initially insufficient bond strength between impregnated overlay and the ink layers which led to unsatisfactory quality of the print appearance and delamination effects. However, the optimization of the pressing program {{and the development of a}} modified impregnation procedure for the underlay and overlay papers allowed the successful implementation of digital printing in the production line of our industrial partner FunderMax...|$|E

40|$|The {{ability to}} realize truly {{three-dimensional}} electronic circuits is complicated {{if not impossible}} using traditional fabrication techniques. Such techniques are limited {{to the use of}} two dimensional printed circuit boards (PCBs), and require various dissonant processes which exhaust time, volume and cost. Due to the nature of Additive Manufacturing (AM) such problems are diminished and in some ways completely overcome. Additive Manufacturing allows for a higher range of design freedom along conformal surfaces, as well as unit level customization; it is the threshold for embedded electronics, allowing for three-dimensional circuitry in ways traditional fabrication is unfeasible. In such ways, additive technologies provide for a diverse range of optimization toward space applications, such as small satellites. Specific to this research is the CubeSat project, which is the use of small satellites to provide for low cost fabrication, as well as shared launches. The purpose of UTEP 2 ̆ 7 s collaboration with the CubeSat project is to prove not only the successful integration of additive technologies for low cost fabrication of small satellites but participate in the launch and prove the performance of such fabricated devices in space research. The Additive technologies described within this thesis are both Stereolithography and Fused Deposition Modeling. Also discussed are the <b>Direct</b> <b>Print</b> <b>process</b> used and the conductive ink required to fabricate the conductive traces of circuitry. The fabrication process and advantages of said technologies, {{as well as those of}} the materials required, are discussed in reference to space applications. The following research incorporates an avant-garde approach to fabricating small satellites, calling for the use of both additive technologies as well as <b>Direct</b> <b>Print</b> <b>processes.</b> Described herein is the process for creating such structures, the advantages Additive and <b>Direct</b> <b>Print</b> technologies offer toward the fabrication of said structures and the successful fabrication of a CubeSat module section, set to launch in 2012. ...|$|R

These structures find their applications in 3 D Micro-Electro Mechanical Systems (MEMS), ultra-sound and thermal imaging, heat exchangers and solid oxide fuel cells. The present research is focused on fabrication of vertical ceramic micro-pillars using the Aerosol Jet <b>direct</b> write <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> for enhancing the aspect ratio of the pillars. Aerosol Jet printing offers flexibility with respect to ink compositions as compared with fabrication techniques such as lithography or ink-jet printing. This study includes an investigation of ink compositions to formulate a printable Yttria Stabilized Zirconia (YSZ) ink. YSZ ceramic is chosen due to its wide range of applications. The effect of solid loading fraction on the viscosity of ink is also studied. The study identifies significant <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> parameters and their relationships to the <b>process</b> output for <b>printing</b> high aspect ratio YSZ micro-pillars. An experimental approach is followed where the diameter and height of pillars are the response variables of interest. A screening experiment with fractional factorial model is conducted in order to obtain the levels of process parameters that resulted in pillars with diameters as small as 50 µm and heights up to 1000 µm. After finding suitable process parameter levels, experiments were conducted to identify the minimum distance between consecutive pillars. Once the minimum possible distance was identified, 4 x 4 pillar arrays were printed on YSZ substrate and sintered in order to achieve sufficient pillar strength. Pillars with average diameters as small as 50 µm and heights up to 1000 µm were achieved through this process...|$|R
40|$|A {{comparative}} study {{of the effect of}} ultrashort (0. 5 ps) and short (15 ns) pulses on the laser forward transfer of DNA molecules is presented in this paper. We use femtosecond laser pulses to directly print a wide range of biomaterials, in complicated patterns and structures. The ultrashort laser pulses reduce the thermal effects, thus allowing the effective deposition of sensitive biomaterials at high spatial resolution for micro-fabricating patterns. This <b>direct</b> laser <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> enables gentle and spatially selective transfer of biomaterials and facilitates application possibilities for the fabrication of biosensors and arrays for multi-analyte assays.

40|$|This thesis {{centers on}} the use of 3 D <b>direct</b> write <b>printing</b> <b>processes</b> to produce Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) {{structures}} having engineered porosity and macro structure. The objective of the work presented here {{is to be able to}} locally control porosity in the anode and cathode structure using 3 D <b>direct</b> write <b>printing</b> methods. It is well understood that grading the electrodes enhances the SOFC 2 ̆ 7 s performance. A hierarchically graded porous electrode structure, varying from smallest pores at the electrode/electrolyte interface to largest pores at electrode/gas interface can be printed via 3 D direct write methods. Layers as thin as 15 µm have been achieved using this process. The change in the degree of electrode porosity achieved by varying the graphite loading fraction has been experimentally mapped out. The feasibility of changing the composition/porosity within a layer has been demonstrated, which also opens up possibilities for varying chemical composition within a layer/plane. The second contribution of this work {{centers on the}} synthesis of a channeled electrode architecture aimed at producing structures with extremely low tortuosity. The proposed direct-write synthesis approach overcomes limitations of alternative approaches by allowing symmetric ribs and channels to be printed that balance out shrinkage stresses. The proposed channel architecture has been demonstrated, and models correlating process parameters with resulting surface area have been developed...|$|R

Hydrographic printing is an innovative <b>printing</b> <b>process.</b> Hydrographic <b>printing</b> is a technique of applying two dimensional printed designs to complex 3 D surfaces using water. Prior to this innovation, printing on such complex surfaces are done by chemically or electroplating techniques. A customized pattern can be printed simply onto complex surfaces. It is applicable where <b>direct</b> <b>printing</b> is not possible. In this technique, water-soluble transfer PVA film that carries a special ink is placed on the surface of water and ink is activated by reagent. Finally, the object is gradually immersed into the water through the floating ink film that stretches and wraps around the surface of object and adheres to objects. It is suitable for materials likes metal, plastic, ceramics, glass, and hard wood. In other words, it is an Industrial <b>printing</b> <b>process</b> that is <b>printing</b> on a product for either decorative or functional purpose.

40|$|Direct write {{processes}} {{include a}} range of additive manufacturing technologies. These technologies are employed to fabricate structures by depositing layer upon layer of functional material. The feature resolutions obtained are often in the micron or sub-micron range. This thesis focuses on use of the Aerosol Jet <b>direct</b> write <b>printing</b> <b>process,</b> which shows promise for the fabrication of ceramic films due to its fine feature resolution and flexibility with printing complex features. This study identifies significant process parameters {{and their relationship to}} the process output for deposition of Samarium-doped Ceria (SDC) nano-ink. A design of experiments approach is used to generate a model where height and width of the printed tracks are the response variables of interest. Initial feasible operating ranges for each process parameter were identified. Then fractional factorial screening experiments were designed to identify the significant factors affecting the response variables in the study. Two distinct regression equations were generated to predict width and height. Validation experiments were run to confirm the actual values as compared with the predicted ones. For height, the experiment results suggested lack of curvature as well as the standard error and R-squared values were found satisfactory. For width, a higher order model was designed referring to the results of the validation experiment. For the higher order model a three factor three level experiment was considered. The higher order model gives a much lesser standard error and better fit of residuals as compared to the screening model for width. In addition, the study includes a brief discussion on use of Aerosol Jet printing system to manufacture high aspect ratio structures in addition to its application in thin film deposition. The work further demonstrates printing of a high aspect ratio micro-pillar array as a proof of this concept...|$|R

Furthermore, conventional IC processes involve multistep; therefore, they are very time consuming and expensive. In this regard, the DOD inkjet printing as an additive process has drawn tremendous attention because inkjet printing is fully data driven and maskless process which allows more versatility than other <b>direct</b> <b>printing</b> methods.
