25|$|The {{people of}} Gilgit thought {{themselves}} to be ethnically different from the Kashmiris and resented being under Kashmir state rule.

Major William Brown, the Maharaja's commander of the Gilgit Scouts, believed that the British handover of Gilgit to Kashmir was a <b>huge</b> <b>mistake.</b> Brown recounts that when he met the scouts they indirectly made it clear how they despised and hated Kashmir and everything connected with it, how happy and content they had been under the British rule, and how they considered they had been betrayed by the British in the unconditional handing over of their country to Kashmir. Taking advantage of the situation the populace of Gilgit-Baltistan started revolting, the people of Ghizer were first to raise the flag of revolution, and gradually the masses of entire region stood up against the rule of Maharaja, again British played an important role in war of independence of Gilgit-Baltistan.|$|E

Squidward reveals himself as the person in the costume, and explains that as much as he hates SpongeBob (which SpongeBob himself acknowledges), he hates the smell of burning Krabby Patties even more, and both he and Mr. Krabs ask SpongeBob to be the fry cook again, with Mr. Krabs admitting that he made a <b>huge</b> <b>mistake</b> in firing SpongeBob in the first place. SpongeBob gladly accepts his old job as the fry cook, and puts the restaurant back on track, which brings back all the customers, even the four restaurant managers who fought over SpongeBob.

50|$|Athenian {{democracy}} has had many critics, both ancient and modern.

For them, the common people were not necessarily the right people to rule and had made <b>huge</b> <b>mistakes.</b> According to Samons:The modern desire to look to Athens for lessons or encouragement for modern thought, government, or society must confront this strange paradox: the people that gave rise to and practiced ancient democracy left us almost nothing but criticism of this form of regime (on a philosophical or theoretical level). And what is more, the actual history of Athens in the period of its democratic government is marked by numerous failures, mistakes, and misdeeds—most infamously, the execution of Socrates—that would seem to discredit the ubiquitous modern idea that democracy leads to good government.|$|R

40|$|The {{distortion}} of human pelvis X ray scans, due to different scanning positions, can cause <b>huge</b> <b>mistakes</b> in estimation of pelvic diameters. The {{aim of the}} study was to quantify {{distortion of}} pelvic diameters in relation to scanning inclination angles. Twenty anatomically defined spots on the pelvis of a young male cadaver, freed of soft tissues, were marked with 3 mm metal balls. The digitalized X-ray scans were made with seven different but similar inclination angles, and marked spots were recognized by computer software. Obstetrical-gynecological (Ob-Gyn), horizontal and vertical diameters were measured between marked spots, and percentages of distortion were calculated for each new scanning position. Twenty seven distances on human pelvis from seven X-ray scans varied from – 35. 9 % to 28. 3 %, on average 0. 47 %. This study has pointed to a high variation of vertical pelvic dimensions (4. 94 ± 5. 73 %), consequently making them unreliable in the estimation of general pelvic shape, and low variation of horizontal dimensions (0. 92 ± 0. 61 %). Generally, the percentage of variation of pelvic dimensions highly increases with inclination angle, in frontal and sagital plane. Alteration of scanning distance by 4 cm has a weak influence on pelvic diameters. The most reliable Ob-Gyn pelvic diameter was conjugata diagonalis, then diameters obliqua prima and secunda, with an average length deviations of 3. 4, 4. 0, and 6. 0 % respectively. The conjugata anatomica was themost unreliable with an average variation of 11. 5 %...|$|R

Since then, these two mentions have been used to illustrate either the involvement of Lombard or of another painter named “Lambert” in the painting of the panels.

2500|$|In February 1986, Chrétien whose {{relations}} with Turner were very poor, resigned {{his seat and}} left public life for a time. On February 27, 1986, Chrétien accompanied by his special executive assistant Jean Carle went to Turner's office to hand in his resignation. Turner forced Chrétien to wait a considerable period of time, during which Carle broke down in tears while Chrétien was visibly angry when Turner finally received them, making for a tense and barely civil meeting. Chrétien's resignation was largely motivated by his desire to better organise against Turner in the leadership review due {{in the fall of}} 1986. [...] Now working in the private sector again, Chrétien sat on the boards of several corporations, including the Power Corporation of Canada subsidiary Consolidated Bathurst, the Toronto-Dominion Bank, and the Brick Warehouse Corporation. Though Chrétien professed to be retired from politics, he told reporters within days of his retirement that: [...] "I will always be a politician. I love politics". Crucially, Chrétien did not disband the campaign organization that he founded in 1984 which suggested that his retirement was always intended to be temporary. In November 1986 when the Liberals held a leadership review, Chrétien attempted to organise against Turner, which led to a bruising battle between factions loyal to the two men. To topple Turner, Chrétien used Turner's penchant for heavy drinking to spread rumors that Turner was an alcoholic who was simply too drunk most of the time to effectively lead the Liberals to power. Chrétien formally claimed to be neutral {{on the question of the}} leadership review of Turner's management of the Liberal Party, but behind the scenes Chrétien lobbied as many Grit MPs and senators as possible for their support in bringing down Turner. Two Liberal leading power-brokers Marc Lalonde and Senator Keith Davey aka [...] "the Rainmaker" [...] both backed Turner in 1984, and in the aftermath of the 1984 election, Lalonde and Davey decided they had made a <b>huge</b> <b>mistake</b> with Turner, which they were determined to rectify in 1986 by installing Chrétien as the leader best able to return the Liberals to power. The intense emotions stirred up by the 1986 leadership review were well-illustrated when Chrétien arrived to vote in the review, which led a [...] "chaotic melee" [...] on the convention floor at the Ottawa Convention Centre as pro-Turner and pro-Chrétien Liberals fought one another with their fists, and led to the police being called to end the violence. Turner won the leadership review by the mass signing up of immigrants as [...] "instant Liberals" [...] who provided a loyal bloc of delegates. It is quite likely that without the support of the [...] "instant Liberals", Turner would have lost the leadership review as many within the Liberal Party were deeply angry at him for losing the 1984 election. Many Liberals believed if only Chrétien had won the 1984 convention instead of Turner, that they would not have lost the 1984 election, or at least not as badly.|$|E

It was claimed that Raeder as [...] "apolitical" [...] officer who had just been doing his duty to the Fatherland borne no legal or moral guilt for anything that had happened under the Third Reich, and that the real responsibility for Nazi crimes rested with the governments of the United Kingdom, France and the United States who had imposed the Treaty of Versailles on Germany. It was claimed that the Allies had [...] "good reason" [...] to forbid using resistance against Versailles as a defense at Nuremberg because Nazi Germany was a [...] "direct consequence of the situation created by the victorious enemy powers in 1918". Along the same lines, it was charged that the Nuremberg trial of 1945–46 was meant by the Allies to cover up the [...] "decisive part" [...] played by the Versailles treaty in causing Nazi Germany and the war crimes committed by the Allies [...] "...by damning the whole German nation as an international outlaw" [...] and it was [...] "...the German people as a whole who were to be indicted as the sole criminals, guilty of waging a malevolent war of aggression". As such, the Nuremberg trials were presented as having nothing to do with justice, but instead were a political show trial. The Commando Order, the cash payments from the Konto 5 slush fund and Raeder's calls for war with the United States were not mentioned in Mein Leben. Instead it was claimed Raeder was opposed to war with the United States and had always worked to protect neutral shipping during the war with the committee having Raeder say: [...] "We had to consider neutrals to avoid any possible unfortunate incidents" [...] at sea. The invasion of Norway was presented as a measure to protect Norway's neutrality from Britain, and Raeder claimed to have been a [...] "political prisoner" [...] at Spandau. Finally, Raeder was presented as a victim of Hitler with the committee having Raeder say [...] "It was the tragedy of my life that our future took a completely different path". Dönitz also headed the call for the [...] "united front". Besides for the Z Plan, which Dönitz called a <b>huge</b> <b>mistake,</b> Dönitz's memoirs presented Raeder in a favorable light, leading the British historian Peter Padfield to remark [...] "It is an open question which of the two Grand Admirals produced the more deliberately dishonest volume".|$|E

That the fittest must survive, and that any one like himself must be the fittest; that the weakest must go to the wall, and that any one he could not understand must be the weakest; that was the philosophy which he lumberingly believed through life, like many another agnostic old bachelor of the Victorian era. All his views on religion (reverently quoted in the Review of Reviews) were simply the stalest ideas of his time. It was not his fault, poor fellow, that he called a high hill somewhere in South Africa [...] "his church."

Their pitch struggled badly in terms of finances and Jim making a <b>huge</b> mathematical <b>mistake,</b> with Lord Sugar remarking that their profit margins would be poor. These flaws ultimately cost them the task.|$|R

Facebook has managed to arrive even in poor and remote territories which apparently have nothing to do with our always on the move modern world. However, only on the African continent there are more than 100 million active Facebook users who represent 50 % of the African population having access to Internet. Thus, it would be <b>huge</b> marketing <b>mistake</b> for businesses not to take into consideration this opportunity to get in touch with prospective customers (Neti, 2011). Social media is hot and has turned into a “must ” for businesses looking for brand awareness. Therefore, the techniques used to attract customers by means of social networks have gained quite a high degree of sophistry (Neti, 2011). In an age in which the average internet user accesses his/her social network account at least fourteen times a day, companies cannot afford to be absent from this medium. The aim of the present paper is to present the concept and characteristics of social media and how it can be used in order to increase brand awareness...|$|R

U povijesti su ekonomski efikasniji i tržišno konkurentniji oblici vlaniištva smjenjivali one manje efikasne i konkurentne oblike vlasništva. Ekonomija i politika tranzicije zapravo je nastala zbog toga što ni država ni društveno vlasništvo nisu mogli izdržati konkurenciju privatnoga vlasništva. Na idejnim osnovama svestranog razvitka civilnoga društva razvila se i čitava koncepcija i strategija ekonomije i politike tranzicije jer razvitak civilnoga društva zajednički je cilj svih zemalja u tranziciji. Novo političko ozračje koje je zahvaljujući demokratskim promjenama uslijedilo na početku godine 2000. daje nade da će i Republika Hrvatska krenuti u smjeru euroatlantskih integracija i razvitka civilnoga društva. As {{a matter}} of fact the history of {{political}} economy is the history of ownership. In history, economically more efficient and marketly more competitive forms of ownership were replacing those less efficient and less competitive, within the frames of which they had arisen. In fact, economics and politics of transition emerged due to the reason that neither state nor social ownership could endure competitiveness of private ownership. Is this the end of history of political economy, especially the political economy of socialism? It surely is not, because it was the bolshevik option of real socialism which suffered the breakdown, and the idea of social state and social justice especially in the period after the World War II experienced its full promotion. Even on these fundamentals of development of civil society, theoretical and practical achievements of economics and politics of welfare left a note and imprint to Euro-atlantic integrational processes. These theoretical bases represent common denominator which links the countries of the European Union together. In the sense of many-sided development of civil society these ideas will note both social and political movements of the twenty-first century. The entire conception and strategy of economics and politics of transition developed on such ideological bases. Development of civil society is the common goal of all countries in transition. All mighty European political powers act in this sense. That especially refers to three internationals: (1) social-democratic, (2) social-liberal, (3) Christian-democratic. The Republic of Croatia was best prepared for realization of economics and politics of transition and development of civil society. Deviating occurences as it was privatization by tycoonization and the appearance of mafia-cracy, the wrong level of stabilization, the mistakes of entire policy (especially towards Bosnia and Herzegovina) threw irretrievably all big mentioned advantages. New political atmosphere which thanks to democratic changes appeared at the beginning of 2000, gives a hope that the Republic of Croatia will also (in spite of huge damages not only due to war, but <b>huge</b> <b>mistakes</b> of economic and entire policy) move in direction of Euro-atlantic integrations and development of civil society...|$|R
