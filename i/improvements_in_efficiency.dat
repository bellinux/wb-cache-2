25|$|In France, Pierre-Théophile Berton {{invented a}} system {{consisting}} of longitudinal wooden slats {{connected by a}} mechanism that lets the miller open them while the mill is turning.

50|$|Increasing {{the boiler}} {{pressure}} above the very low, virtually atmospheric pressure steam used by James Watt was {{an essential element}} of the <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> of the Cornish engine. However, simply increasing the boiler pressure would have made an engine more powerful without increasing its efficiency. The key advance was allowing the steam to expand in the cylinder. While James Watt had conceived of the idea of allowing expansive working of steam—and included it in his 1782 patent--, he realized that the low steam pressure of his application made the <b>improvement</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> negligible, and so did not pursue it.|$|R
25|$|There {{are several}} {{possible}} types of metering element in use. Flow benches ordinarily {{use one of}} three types: orifice plate, venturi meter and pitot/static tube, all of which deliver similar accuracy. Most commercial machines use orifice plates due to their simple construction and the ease of providing multiple flow ranges. Although the venturi offers substantial <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency,</b> its cost is higher.|$|E
25|$|American {{physical}} chemist Ching W. Tang and Steven Van Slyke at Eastman Kodak {{built the first}} practical OLED device in 1987. This device used a two-layer structure with separate hole transporting and electron transporting layers such that recombination and light emission occurred {{in the middle of}} the organic layer; this resulted in a reduction in operating voltage and <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency.</b>|$|E
25|$|An {{analysis}} of the two Tapajós River plants published in 2014 concluded that forecasts of demand for electricity had been overstated, and plans did {{not take into account}} <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> of energy use and the availability of new power sources such as solar and wind power. Taking into account the cost of the transmission system they concluded that the project was not cost-effective even when excluding factors such as loss of fishing and tourism revenue, water quality degradation and carbon emissions.|$|E

25|$|The Bridgeman Committee, {{chaired by}} Lord Bridgeman, {{was set up}} in 1932 to {{investigate}} criticisms of the General Post Office and reported the same year. It highlighted defects {{in the structure of the}} organisation. The Gardiner Committee, chaired by Sir Thomas Gardiner, was set up to investigate <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> and reported in 1936. The report recommended the setting up of eight provincial regions outside London, and the introduction of the London Postal Region and London Telecommunications Region for the capital and surrounding area. The changes were implemented between 1936 and 1940.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{business}} sector, multimodality creates opportunities for {{both internal and}} external <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency.</b> Similar to shifts in education to utilize both textual and visual learning elements, multimodality allows businesses to have better communication. According to Vala Afshar, this transition first started to occur in the 1980s as [...] "technology had become an essential part of business." [...] This level of communication has amplified with the integration of digital media and tools during the 21st century.|$|E
2500|$|Until September 2007, the Partnership also owned two further textile {{production}} businesses: Carlisle-based printer Stead McAlpin (founded c. 1875, 200 workers) and Haslingden, Lancashire-based weaver J. H. Birtwistle. [...] In {{spite of}} capital investment and <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency,</b> neither had been profitable for almost 10 years. Apex Textiles, whose managing director is Jim Kidd, {{was formed to}} buy the businesses. The Partnership announced its intention to retain both businesses as key suppliers once they were under new ownership and to agree ex gratia payments to Partners employed at the affected sites.|$|E

2500|$|Best {{known for}} its dull color scheme and cramped, uncomfortable ride, the Trabant is an object of playful ridicule for many Germans and is {{regarded}} as symbolic {{of the fall of}} the Eastern Bloc. Known as a [...] "spark plug with a roof" [...] because of its small size, the car gained public affection and something of a cult following. Its design remained essentially unchanged since its introduction in the late 1950s, and the last model was introduced in 1964. In contrast, the West German Volkswagen Beetle received a number of updates (including <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency)</b> over a similar period.|$|E
2500|$|Exports from Ethiopia to China {{have grown}} from {{negligible}} levels before 2000 to around US$130 million in 2006, primarily in raw {{materials such as}} sesame seeds and partially finished leather. [...] Meanwhile, exports from China to Ethiopia have grown from under US$50 million in 1996 to US$430 million in 2006, including low-priced clothing, machinery and electronics equipment. The Ethiopian government has encouraged imports, purchasing Chinese equipment and supplying it to local construction and manufacturing firms on a lease-to-buy basis. Trade continues to grow rapidly. By 2015 bilateral trade had grown to $3.8 billion, with Ethiopian exports encouraged through special quota and tariff arrangements on many goods. In a paper prepared for the OECD, economist Tegegne Gebre Egziabher of Addis Ababa University notes that in the short term, cheap Chinese imports may have damaged local producers. However, the longer term benefit may be to stimulate <b>improvements</b> <b>in</b> <b>efficiency</b> and quality. Chinese investment in local infrastructure may assist towards this outcome.|$|E
