500|$|In October 2001, Fred Durst {{posted on}} the band's website: [...] "Limp Bizkit and Wes Borland have {{amicably}} decided to part ways. Both Limp Bizkit and Borland will continue to pursue their respective musical careers. Both wish each other {{the best of luck}} in all future endeavors." [...] Borland explained why he left Limp Bizkit; he said: [...] "I could have probably gone on and still played the part of the guitar player of Limp Bizkit, but musically I was kind of bored. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> continue, it would have been about the money and not about the true music, and I don't want to lie to myself, or to them or to fans of Limp Bizkit." ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> {{spend two}} years on the 16 {{paintings}} for Masquerade I wanted them to mean something. I recalled how, as a child, I had come across [...] "treasure hunts" [...] in which the puzzles were not exciting nor the treasure worth finding. So I {{decided to make a}} real treasure, of gold, bury it in the ground and paint real puzzles to lead people to it. The key was to be Catherine of Aragon's Cross at Ampthill, near Bedford, casting a shadow like the pointer of a sundial.|$|E
2500|$|The Union army {{managed to}} escape {{complete}} disaster because of the stout defense organized by Thomas on Horseshoe Ridge, heroism that earned him the nickname [...] "Rock of Chickamauga." [...] The army withdrew that night to fortified positions in Chattanooga. Bragg had not succeeded in his objective to destroy the Army of the Cumberland, but the Battle of Chickamauga was nonetheless the worst Union defeat in the Western Theater. Thomas urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga. President Lincoln attempted {{to prop up the}} morale of his general, telegraphing [...] "Be of good cheer. ... We have unabated confidence in you and your soldiers and officers. In the main, you must be the judge as to what is to be done. <b>If</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>to</b> suggest, I would say save your army by taking strong positions until Burnside joins you." [...] Privately, Lincoln told John Hay that Rosecrans seemed [...] "confused and stunned like a duck hit on the head." ...|$|E

2500|$|Thomas {{withdrew the}} {{remainder}} of his units to positions around Rossville Gap after darkness fell. His personal determination to maintain the Union position until ordered to withdraw while his commander and peers fled earned him the nickname Rock of Chickamauga, derived from a portion of a message that Garfield sent to Rosecrans, [...] "Thomas is standing like a rock." [...] Garfield met Thomas in Rossville that night and wired to Rosecrans that [...] "our men not only held their ground, but in many points drove the enemy splendidly. Longstreet's Virginians have got their bellies full." [...] Although the troops were tired and hungry, and nearly out of ammunition, he continued, [...] "I believe we can whip them tomorrow. I believe we can now crown the whole battle with victory." [...] He urged Rosecrans to rejoin the army and lead it, but Rosecrans, physically exhausted and psychologically a beaten man, remained in Chattanooga. President Lincoln attempted to prop up the morale of his general by telegraphing, [...] "Be of good cheer.... We have unabated confidence in you and your soldiers and officers.
