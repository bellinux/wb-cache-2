50|$|Data in R-trees is {{organized}} in pages, {{that can have}} a variable number of entries (up to some pre-defined maximum, and usually above a minimum fill). Each entry within a non-leaf node stores two pieces of data: a way of identifying a child node, and the bounding box of all entries within this child node. Leaf nodes store the data required for each child, often a point or bounding box representing the child and an <b>external</b> <b>identifier</b> for the child. For point data, the leaf entries can be just the points themselves. For polygon data (that often requires the storage of large polygons) the common setup is to store only the MBR (minimum bounding rectangle) of the polygon along with a unique identifier in the tree.|$|E

It is now possible to receive ORCID Identifiers as part of the data returned from CrossRef using a DOI. The public ORCID API allows applications to use the ORCID Identifier to retrieve biographic data about a given contributor plus obtain a list of works that they have contributed to. The data contained in the list of works may contain citation and <b>external</b> <b>identifier</b> data. If such data is found then this can be used as the source for a new import into the repository. The work to be presented is based upon the public ORCID API.

40|$|Lack {{of support}} for Entity-Relationship (E-R) {{semantics}} and the disconnect between objectoriented programming language (OOPLs) and database languages remain key roadblocks to the effective use of object-orientation in information system development. We have defined SOODAS (Semantic Object-Oriented Data Access System), a purely object oriented language that supports E-R semantics and set level querying, and provides related development tools. SOODAS is implemented by extending the OOPL Smalltalk with five meta-classes. EntityObject and Relationship provide the necessary capabilities to define entities, attributes, relationships, <b>external</b> <b>identifiers,</b> and constraints. Together with QueryNode, EntityObject provides an objectoriented, multi-entity querying capability. Queries can be arbitrarily complex and can include cycles. Persistence is provided by PermanentObject, of which EntityObject and Relationship are subclasses. EntityInterface provides a standard, re-usable interface screen definition for displaying and maintaining instances of any entity.

The project cycle followed six steps: team building, gathering and cleaning of the original data, modelling, transforming, interlinking and exploration of the Linked Data set. The resulting pilot application offers innovative and attractive features based on the capability of the Linked Data, with the aim to provide a better user experience. The major challenge of this project was the creation of links between the internal datasets, and with external sources. An important lesson learnt is therefore to focus more on the interoperability of data at the time of cataloguing in the original databases, for example by integrating <b>external</b> <b>identifiers</b> rather than just terms in the form of strings...|$|R
40|$|The {{requirement}} that all external identifiers in XML documents must provide a system identifier has unquestionably been of tremendous short-term {{benefit to the}} XML community. It has allowed {{a whole generation of}} tools to be developed without the added complexity of explicit entity management. However, the interoperability of XML documents has been impeded in several ways by the lack of entity management facilities: 1. External identifiers may require resources that are not always available. For example, a system identifier that points to a resource on another machine may be inaccessible if a network connection is not available. 2. External identifiers may require protocols that are not accessible to all of the vendors ' tools on a single computer system. An <b>external</b> <b>identifier</b> that is addressed with the ftp: protocol, for example, is not accessible to a tool that does not support that protocol. 3. It is often convenient to access resources using system identifiers that point to local resources. Exchanging documents that refer to local resources with other systems is problematic at best and impossible at worst.

5000|$|The first {{images were}} {{recorded}} in 1973 when BEBC first received beam from the Proton Synchrotron (PS). From 1977 to 1984, the chamber took photos in the West Area neutrino beam line of the Super Proton Synchrotron (SPS) and in hadron beams at energies of up to 450 GeV. During 1978, a Track-Sensitive Target (TST) was installed to combine the advantages of hydrogen and heavy liquid bubble chambers. [...] Hydrogen-filled chambers enable the study of particle interactions with free protons {{but they have a}} low efficiency for gamma ray conversion. On the other hand, heavy liquid filling is better suited for the detection of gamma rays but the events are harder to interpret. An <b>External</b> Muon <b>Identifier</b> (EMI) and an <b>External</b> Particle <b>Identifier</b> (EPI) were added to the BEBC, in 1979, to identify muons and charged hadrons, respectively, leaving the chamber.

40|$|Institutional {{repositories}} have a dual role, {{being both}} open archives, disseminating without barriers research results financed by public funds, and a directory of institutional scientific publications. Today, {{a new kind}} of functionality may be added to these repositories : they allow to evaluate University's scientific production through bibliometric analysis. Indeed, two special types of metadata are included into institutional repositories: bibliographic and administrative information (attribution of publications to each author or research unit from the institution for instance), making them particularly interesting for bibliometric use. It is common to make use of international and subject databases to feed and improve the content of the institutional repository. These mines of bibliographic information are currently used to import references into archives, individually or in batch. Using Web services and AJAX techniques, they are also exploited during data entry: with a simple identifier, bibliographic metadata is injected into a web form or proposed while typing. At the same time, bibliographic metadata is enriched with unique identifiers that connect the archive with <b>external</b> databases. These <b>identifiers</b> allow the addition of deep links to external databases from the archive or university web pages display. In bibliometrics, these identifiers also play a major role because they allow information import and update. Indeed, for a journal article, the ISSN makes the inclusion of journal impact indicators easier. Other unique identifiers can be used to import the citations count received for a document, calculated by different databases and open archives: UT for the Web of Science, PMID for PubMed Central and PubMed and DOI for CrossRef and SCOPUS The use of data from an institutional repository as a source of bibliometrics analysis has two advantages. On the one hand, this requires different units of the university to agree and work together to improve the archive's metadata and keep it up to date. On the other hand, the effort invested in sorting, selecting and assigning publications to authors and research units may be exploited by the university evaluation services in order to solve ambiguities generated by homonyms that are common in general databases and makes the bibliometric analysis complicated. Since the creation of Lausanne University's open archive "SERVAL" in late 2008, we are working in this direction at the Faculty of Biology and Medicine. Currently, the data from SERVAL is used to calculate bibliometric indicators for faculty research units' evaluation. Up to now, these indicators only took into account the impacts of journals in which researchers publish. We are currently working to establish a new system that allows the archive to be enriched with the number of citations for each item. This information will allow us to calculate the h-index and use it as new indicator in our bibliometrics. Managing this new kind of information requires to improve the current system and to make modifications at two levels: upstream, completing and correcting metadata from the archive; and downstream, processing and enriching data with citations information. Indeed, bibliometric indicators are changing rapidly, particularly the number of citations that needs to be updated frequently. The aim of this project is to create a new flexible system that can be integrated with other institutional repositories. We believe that the use of these data for bibliometrics is an opportunity to combine forces around the archive and fulfill even more important functions within the institution...|$|R
