5|$|Reportedly, it was SK Ull's <b>forays</b> <b>into</b> the {{district}} around Holmenkollen for sporting purposes that spurred {{the establishment of}} the new hill Holmenkollbakken in 1891. The knowledge of the area spurred Fritz R. Huitfeldt to pinpoint the location of the new hill, together with Hans Krag. This hill lay at a higher altitude than Kastellbakken, and thus had more favourable snow conditions. Holmenkollbakken quickly replaced Kastellbakken as the main hill in {{the district}}, and eventually became world-famous.|$|E
5|$|The {{rapprochement}} {{was not to}} last long, as on 13 April 1975 a coup d'état removed Tombalbaye {{and replaced}} him with General Félix Malloum. As the coup was partly motivated by opposition to Tombalbaye's appeasement of Libya, Gaddafi considered it a menace to his influence and resumed supplying the FROLINAT. In April 1976, there was a Gaddafi-backed attempted assassination of Malloum, {{and in the same}} year Libyan troops started making <b>forays</b> <b>into</b> central Chad in company of FROLINAT forces.|$|E
5|$|The Ming {{sporadically}} sent armed <b>forays</b> <b>into</b> Tibet {{during the}} 14th century, which the Tibetans successfully resisted. Several scholars {{point out that}} unlike the preceding Mongols, the Ming dynasty did not garrison permanent troops in Tibet. The Wanli Emperor (r. 1572–1620) attempted to reestablish Sino-Tibetan relations {{in the wake of}} a Mongol-Tibetan alliance initiated in 1578, an alliance which affected the foreign policy of the subsequent Manchu Qing dynasty (1644–1912) in their support for the Dalai Lama of the Yellow Hat sect. By the late 16th century, the Mongols proved to be successful armed protectors of the Yellow Hat Dalai Lama after their increasing presence in the Amdo region, culminating in the conquest of Tibet by Güshi Khan (1582–1655) in 1642, establishing the Khoshut Khanate.|$|E

5|$|Collaborations is a four-disc {{compilation}} box set by Indian classical musician Ravi Shankar {{and former}} Beatle George Harrison. Released in October 2010 on Dark Horse Records, it compiles two studio albums originally issued on that label – the long-unavailable Shankar Family & Friends (1974) and Ravi Shankar's Music Festival from India (1976) – and Chants of India, first issued on Angel Records in 1997. Although all three albums were originally Shankar releases, for which Harrison {{served in the}} role of music producer and guest musician, both Shankar and Harrison are credited as artists on the box set. Each of the collaborative projects represents a departure from Shankar's more typical work as a sitarist and performer of Hindustani classical ragas, with the box set showcasing his <b>forays</b> <b>into,</b> variously, jazz and rock, Indian folk and orchestral ensembles, and devotional music.|$|E
5|$|In late June, Korvettenkapitän Karl Bartenbach, {{head of the}} Flanders Flotilla, used UB-6 to test {{a theory}} that British {{defenses}} in the Straits of Dover—anti-submarine nets and mines—were not insurmountable. On the evening of 21 June, UB-6 departed Zeebrugge for a round-trip to Boulogne. UB-6 sailed past Dunkirk {{on the surface and}} made Boulogne in the early morning of the 22nd, having to crash dive once during the voyage when discovered by a British destroyer. UB-6 immediately made the return trip and arrived safely at Zeebrugge later the same day. Three other UB I boats, , , and , soon followed with patrols in the Channel, but bad weather and fog hampered the boats and none had any success. Even though no ships were sunk during these <b>forays</b> <b>into</b> the English Channel, by successfully completing their voyages, the submarines helped further prove the feasibility of defeating the British countermeasures in the Straits of Dover.|$|E
5|$|Rutherford's Liberals self-identified as {{the party}} of free enterprise, in {{contrast}} to the public ownership-supporting Conservatives. Despite this, they made a limited number of large-scale <b>forays</b> <b>into</b> government operation of utilities, the most notable of which was the creation of Alberta Government Telephones. In 1906, Alberta's municipalities legislation was passed and included a provision authorizing municipalities to operate telephone companies. Several, including Edmonton, did so, alongside private companies. The largest of this latter group was the Bell Telephone Company, which held a monopoly over service in Calgary. Such monopolies and the private firms' refusal to extend their services into sparsely populated and unprofitable rural areas aroused demand for provincial entry into the market, which was effected in 1907. The government constructed a number of lines, beginning with one between Calgary and Banff, and also purchased Bell's lines for $675,000.|$|E

5|$|After the 10th century, Muslim Central Asian nomadic clans, using swift-horse cavalry {{and raising}} vast armies united by {{ethnicity}} and religion, repeatedly overran South Asia's north-western plains, leading eventually {{to the establishment}} of the Islamic Delhi Sultanate in 1206. The sultanate was to control much of North India, and to make many <b>forays</b> <b>into</b> South India. Although at first disruptive for the Indian elites, the sultanate largely left its vast non-Muslim subject population to its own laws and customs. By repeatedly repulsing Mongol raiders in the 13th century, the sultanate saved India from the devastation visited on West and Central Asia, setting the scene for centuries of migration of fleeing soldiers, learned men, mystics, traders, artists, and artisans from that region into the subcontinent, thereby creating a syncretic Indo-Islamic culture in the north. The sultanate's raiding and weakening of the regional kingdoms of South India {{paved the way for the}} indigenous Vijayanagara Empire. Embracing a strong Shaivite tradition and building upon the military technology of the sultanate, the empire came to control much of peninsular India, and was to influence South Indian society for long afterwards.|$|E
5|$|Mills, {{who played}} as a defender {{and as a}} midfielder, started his career with First Division club Nottingham Forest. He became the club's {{youngest}} league player after making his first-team debut {{at the age of}} 16 in 1978. He played in the victorious 1980 European Cup Final, which made him the youngest finalist in European Cup history. He joined North American Soccer League team the Seattle Sounders in 1982 and played for them as they were beaten by the New York Cosmos in Soccer Bowl '82. While with them Mills had a loan at Derby County, making 23 appearances for the Second Division club. He returned to Forest in 1983, and made 168 appearances over two spells at the club. He left for their rivals, Notts County of the Third Division, in 1987. Mills then joined Leicester City in 1989, and after two unsuccessful <b>forays</b> <b>into</b> the First Division play-offs he helped them win promotion to the Premier League in 1994. He soon returned to County, by this time playing in the First Division, after 232 appearances for Leicester. Here Mills earned the last honour of his playing career, winning the Anglo-Italian Cup in 1995. He retired from professional football in 1996 due to an injury, having made 159 appearances for County over two spells.|$|E
5|$|Some of PETA's {{earliest}} <b>forays</b> <b>into</b> gaming include Flash-based games such as Make Fred Spew (2001) and Save the Chicks (2003), {{which were}} included {{as part of}} PETA's anti-dairy and Kentucky Fried Cruelty campaigns. These games received some coverage in academic and news sources, and PETA's head of online marketing, Joel Bartlett, identified their 2004 Revenge of the PETA Tomatoes and the Frogger parody, Lobster Liberation, {{as some of the}} organization's earliest released games. However it was not until 2007 that PETA began to attract wider attention within the gaming community with its release of Super Chick Sisters, a parody of Super Mario Bros. Controlling two female chicks named Nugget and Chickette, the player sets out to rescue vegetarian actress Pamela Anderson, who has publicly revealed animal cruelty endemic to KFC's food production, from KFC's mascot Colonel Sanders. In 2009, the game was met with a sequel, New Super Chick Sisters, a homage to New Super Mario Bros. In this game, McDonald's mascot Ronald McDonald kidnaps Anderson with the intent of using her as a Happy Meal ingredient, and the Chick Sisters must rescue her again.|$|E
