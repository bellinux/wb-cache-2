40|$|The {{breadth and}} {{dynamics}} of the recent financial crisis have led to efforts to develop <b>forward-looking</b> <b>tools</b> to monitor systemic risk. In this {{paper we propose a}} new measure which is an extension of the absorption ratio (AR) introduced in Kritzman et al. (2010). Using principal component analysis (as in the original AR methodology) in conjunction with a structural model of default we develop a measure of systemic risk that may be calculated using only publicly available data. We call our new measure the credit absorption ratio (CAR). We find that increases in the CAR preceded periods of financial distress during the recent crisis. The CAR may be interpreted economically: it highlights states of the financial system during which the credit fundamentals of institutions and markets exhibit heightened coupling and higher potential for cascading distress. We also demonstrate that a byproduct of CAR analysis provides a measure {{of the degree to which}} specific financial institutions are exposed to systemic risk factors at any point in time. We find that a number of the institutions that exhibited high potential exposure under our measure during the lead-up to the recent crisis subsequently experienced higher levels of distress or required external assistance...|$|R

40|$|The {{need for}} new <b>forward-looking</b> <b>tools</b> in urban {{planning}} is immense: new functional relations and structures are now stretching beyond our capacity to ‘rationally’ capture modern metropolitan spaces (Neumann & Hull, 2009). At the same time, cities struggle to find tools to help manage their long-term transition towards a low-carbon, resource-smart economy. In 2006 – 2007, the municipalities in the Helsinki metropolitan region organised an international competition for ideas titled “Greater Helsinki Vision 2050. ” It drew {{a good number of}} entries in the competition stage and later helped bring together the awarded participants with local planning professionals and citizens. This paper explores the process behind the vision-making exercise and evaluates its success in providing new tools for the long-term transition to a low-carbon, resource-smart Helsinki metropolitan region. The theoretical framework used in this paper is ‘incrementalism with perspective’ (Ganser, Siebel & Sieverts, 1993) and its ideas on using long-term visions in the integration and coordination of incremental activities in various institutions. We perceive the backcasting scenario method (Dreborg, 1996) as a tool for implementing this approach and hence interpret the case example’s results through the framework of this method. The Greater Helsinki Vision 2050 competition was an example of a vision-oriented planning process that provided new tools for bringing the ‘unmanageable’ metropolitan region within the scope of the manageable. The backcasting approach was deployed as a tool for emancipating stakeholders to imagine alternative futures for metropolitan spaces. The backcasting scenario method should be considered a viable tool when managing vision-oriented planning processes: longer than usual time horizons help initiate strategic learning among stakeholders. However, in addition to civil servants, citizens and other stakeholders should be widely engaged in order to secure sustainable results...|$|R
40|$|International audienceResearch and {{engineering}} activities for verification are currently turning to robust goal-oriented error estimation methods. These provide for an effective mean {{of dealing with}} the control and assessment of the numerical quality of specific quantities of interest. A prevailing concern is the derivation of guaranteed and accurate error bounds on such local quantities. In this framework, a general method, based on well-known robust global error estimation methods and extraction techniques, {{has been the subject of}} several research works. It involves the accurate resolution of an auxiliary problem, likewise called adjoint (or mirror in the non-linear case) problem, in order to achieve sharp local error bounds. Nevertheless, this classical bounding technique may lead to imprecise error bounds in some practical situations, especially when the main contributions to the discretization errors related to both reference and auxiliary problems are not located in the same region. Therefore, performances of the classical bounding technique strongly depend on the considered zone of interest, since the most concentrated error region associated to the auxiliary problem usually surrounds this one. In this talk, we first review the classical bounding technique and highlight its main aforementioned drawback. Then, we propose and study two new improvements in order to fill this gap in the robust bounding of linear quantities of interest. These improvements rely on original and <b>forward-looking</b> <b>tools,</b> such as homothetic domains properties, to treat the zone of interest separately from the remainder of the structure, leading to higher quality error bounds. We discuss these proposed alternative bounding techniques and couple them with handbook techniques which allow to handle truly pointwise quantities of interest. The principle of handbook techniques enables to introduce enrichment functions into the resolution of the auxiliary problem. The enrichment functions are applied locally through a partition of unity method (PUM) and correspond to (quasi-) exact solutions of the auxiliary problem. Several two- and three-dimensional numerical experiments are presented to clearly demonstrate the interest and effectivity of the two enhanced techniques...|$|R

40|$|Over {{the next}} several decades, {{traditional}} corporate and government pension plans will encounter increasingly severe problems in many countries. Contributing factors include underfunding status, demographic trends, low savings rates, and inefficient investment/saving strategies. This chapter takes up the last point, showing that a systematic forward-looking asset–liability management model can improve performance across many reward and risk measures. The model {{takes the form of}} a multi-stage stochastic program. We approximate the stochastic program via a set of state-dependent policy rules. A duration-enhancing overlay rule improves performance during economic contractions. The methodology is evaluated via historical backtests and a highly flexible, <b>forward-looking</b> financial planning <b>tool...</b>|$|R
30|$|The {{evaluation}} of the Colombian Technology Foresight Programme (CTFP) [39] focused on the second cycle (2005 – 08) of the CTFP. It was also executed by the Manchester Institute of Innovation Research in 2010. The methods of evaluation were similar to the instruments applied in the case studies described above and included interviews, document analyses, international evaluation panels, online stakeholder surveys, and benchmarking the CTFP practices against Europe and South America. The evaluation criteria (20) included, among others, measures {{for the assessment of}} the management process, the level of achievement of objectives, cost-effectiveness, the efficiency of methods, the engagement of participants, the impact of the results on public and private beneficiaries and stakeholders, and the level of quality and novelty of the outcomes. On the whole, the CTFP objectives were assessed as appropriate and successfully achieved. The evaluation report concluded that the CTFP introduced a wide and effective portfolio of <b>forward-looking</b> approaches and <b>tools.</b> With regard to management and cost-effectiveness, it was stated that the total cost was too low for the amount of work carried out by the Programme. Although the scale of the programme showed excellent value for money, it was recommended that future programmes find ways either to increase funding or {{to reduce the number of}} simultaneous projects. The evaluation team recommended that a wider participation of the general public in the CTFP should be encouraged. In addition, the composition of expert panels could be improved, because there was overrepresentation of figures from administration. Nevertheless, the CTFP positively influenced the activities of key governmental programmes and agencies that define Science and Technology policies and research agendas. The most significant influence of CTFP on public policy was the work on the STI Vision 2019 used for the preparation of the National STI Plan 2019.|$|R
40|$|Diese prospektive, randomisierte, kontrollierte einfache Blindstudie untersucht ultraschallgesteuerte interskalenäre Blockaden des Plexus brachialis bei Patienten mit elektiven Schultereingriffen, bei denen die Operation ohne Allgemeinanästhesie in Regionalanästhesie mit Sedierung durchgeführt wurde. Die Hauptfragestellung untersucht, ob die Injektion des Lokalanästhetikums über einen anterioren oder posterioren Zugangsweg zum interskalenär gelegenen Plexus brachiales Einfluss auf die Inzidenz unerwünschter Nervus phrenicus-Blockaden mit konsekutiver einseitiger Zwerchfellparese hat. Die Zwerchfellfunktion wurde spirometrisch und bei der Hälfte der Patienten zusätzlich auch sonografisch untersucht. Es wurden von September 2011 bis März 2012 84 Patienten eingeschlossen (42 pro Gruppe, Power 80 %). Zur statistisch beweisenden Beantwortung der Hauptfragestellung wurde Fischers exakter Test ausgewählt. Weitere Fragestellungen wurden statistisch beschreibend untersucht. Darunter waren u. a. Block-Erfolgsrate, Vergleichbarkeit spirometrischer und sonografischer Ergebnisse, Blockade-Dauer, Anästhesieverlaufsbeobachtungen während der Operation sowie im Aufwachraum, Patientenzufriedenheit und neurologische Komplikationen. Zusammengefasst lassen sich aus der in der Berufsgenossenschaftlichen Unfallklinik Tübingen durchgeführten Studie folgende Aussagen treffen: Anteriorer oder posteriorer Zugang zur Skalenuslücke können die Inzidenz von unerwünschten Nervus phrenicus-Blockaden bei 15 ml Injektatvolumen nicht reduzieren. Die Inzidenz von spirometrisch und sonografisch erfassten Zwerchfellparesen ist mit jeweils 85, 7 % hoch, aber bei ASA I-II-Patienten ohne klinische Relevanz. Erfahrene Ultraschallanwender können die Nervenwurzeln C 5, C 6 und C 7 bei 100 % der Patienten identifizieren. Spirometrisch kann eine hohe Anzahl von Zwerchfellparesen erkannt werden, allerdings nur, wenn alle vier angewendeten Tests miteinander kombiniert werden. Von den vier in der Spirometrie angewendeten Tests kann am ehesten auf die Vitalkapazität verzichtet werden, weil die Kombination aus FEV 1 + P 0, 1 + Sniff zu ähnlichen Ergebnissen führt (Pareserate 85, 7 % versus 84, 5 %). Die Ultraschallmethode zur Diagnostik einer Zwerchfellparese zeigt eine gute Übereinstimmung mit spirometrischen Daten und ist ein zukunftsweisendes bettseitiges Verfahren. Die Blockade-Erfolgsrate ist mit 98, 8 % sehr hoch – dementsprechend werden im Aufwachraum keine Opiate benötigt. Die Blockade-Wirkung mit 15 ml Ropivacain 1 % hält im Median 10, 5 Stunden an. Schulteroperationen lassen sich bei hoher Patientenzufriedenheit (90, 5 % der Patienten würden sich erneut für die Methode entscheiden) in alleiniger Regionalanästhesie in Verbindung mit einem standardisierten Sedierungskonzept durchführen. Folgende Perspektiven lassen sich ableiten: Wegweisend zur Reduzierung der Parese-Inzidenz ist für zukünftige Studien und die klinische Praxis die Verminderung des injizierten Lokalanästhetikum-Volumens. Zusätzlich kommen ein „tiefer interskalenärer“ respektive ein „supra-supraklavikulärer“ Zugang in Frage. Hierzu gibt es noch keine veröffentlichten Studien. Insbesondere im Hinblick auf bisher wenig beachtete permanente Schädigungen des Nervus phrenicus hat die Untersuchung eines neuen Zugangs Bedeutung. Ultraschalldiagnostik hat das Potenzial, zum Goldstandard der bettseitigen Zwerchfellparese-Erkennung weiterentwickelt zu werden. Hierzu fehlen noch genauere Methodenbeschreibungen und Studien. This prospective, randomised, {{controlled}} and single blinded clinical trial investigates ultrasound guided interscalene brachial plexus blocks {{in patients with}} elective shoulder surgery. The operations were performed in regional anaesthesia and sedation. The main question focuses {{on the effect of}} an anterior or a posterior access to the interscalene brachial plexus: Does the injection of the local anaesthetic via anterior or posterior access {{have an impact on the}} incidence of unintended phrenic nerve blocks with subsequent hemi-diaphragmatic pareses? The diaphragmatic funtion was investigated with pulmonary function tests, and one half of the patients was investigated with ultrasound additionally. 84 patients were included between September 2011 and March 2012 (42 in each group, power 80 %) and Fisher’s exact test was used. Furthermore, various other questions were investigated and looked at with desciptive statistics: block success rate, comparability of spirometric and sonografic results, duration of the block, complications in theatre and recovery room, patient satisfaction and neurological complications. Summary of results: Anterior or posterior access to the interscalene brachial plexus can not reduce the incidence of unintended phrenic nerve blocks, given that 15 ml of local anaesthic are used. The incidence of detected hemi-diaphragmatic paresis is high: 85, 7 % in spirometry and ultrasound. However, this did not prove to be clinically relevant in patients with ASA-status I or II. Experienced ultrasound users can identify the nerve roots of C 5, C 6 and C 7 in 100 % of the patients. Spirometry can detect a high number of hemi-diaphragmatic pareses, however, 4 different tests are required. Pulmonary function tests can be performed without the vital capacity as a combination of FEV 1, p 0, 1 and sniff-test leads to equally high results (rate of hemi-diaphragmatic paresis 85, 7 % versus 84, 5 %). Ultrasound as method to diagnose hemi-diaphragmatic paresis demonstrates the same rate of paresis as does spirometry and is a <b>forward-looking</b> bedside <b>tool.</b> The block success rate is very high (98, 8 %) – no opiods were requested in the recovery room subsequently. The duration of the block was 10, 5 hours median, using 15 ml of ropivacain 1 %. Interscalene brachial plexus block with sedation for shoulder surgery has shown a high patient satisfaction: 90, 5 % of the patient would go for the same method in case they needed a similar surgery again. Six weeks afer the block in 1, 2 % of the patients (n= 1) a potentially permanent neurological abnormal finding occurred (numbness on one finger). Future perspectives: The trend-setting method for clinical practice and further trials to reduce unintended phrenic nerve blocks with subsequent hemi-diaphragmativ paresis will be a reduction of local anaesthetic volume. Additionally, a „supra-supra-clavicular“ access could be helpful as the local anaesthetic would be injected in a greater distance to the phrenic nerve. Furthermore, there are case reports with permanent injury of the phrenic nerve that are not really payed attention to yet. There are currently no trials to this method published yet. Patients with ASA-status I-II having undergone shoulder surgery in ultrasound guided interscalene brachial plexus block with sedation can be transfered dirctly from operating theatre to the normal ward, given that their Aldrete Score is 10 befor transfer. Ultrasound as diagnostic bedside tool has a large potential to develop to the gold standard for assessment of diaphragmatic function. Further studies are needed...|$|R
