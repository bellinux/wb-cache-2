5|$|A year later, Manekshaw was {{promoted}} {{to the position of}} army commander and took over Western Command. In 1964, he moved from Shimla to Calcutta as the General Officer Commanding-in-Chief (GOC-in-C) of the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command.</b> As GOC-in-C <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command,</b> he successfully responded to an insurgency in Nagaland for which he was later awarded the Padma Bhushan in 1968.|$|E
5|$|The {{war started}} officially on 3 December 1971, when Pakistani {{aircraft}} bombed Indian Air Force {{bases in the}} western part of the country. The Army Headquarters, under the leadership Manekshaw, formulated a strategy as follows: the II Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Tapishwar Narain Raina (later General, and COAS), was to enter from the west; the IV Corps, commanded Lieutenant General Sagat Singh, was to enter from the west; the XXXIII Corps, commanded by Lieutenant General Mohan L. Thapan was enter to from the west; additionally the 101 Communication Zone Area, commanded by Major General Gurbax Singh, was to provide support from the northeast. This strategy was to be executed by the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command,</b> under Lieutenant General Jagjit Singh Aurora. Manekshaw instructed Lieutenant General J. F. R. Jacob, chief of staff <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command,</b> to inform the Indian prime minister that orders were being issued for the movement of troops from <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command.</b> The following day, the navy and the air force also initiated full-scale operations on both eastern and western fronts.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of the Second World War, Howell once again offered his services and enlisted in the Australian Army on 14 October 1939. Posted to <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command</b> Headquarters, Paddington, he was granted the rank of staff sergeant, but found staff work to be dull and sought his discharge in February 1941. In August 1944, Howell enlisted in the United States Army for service in the United States Sea Transport Service, and was thus able to participate in the invasion of Leyte at the commencement of the Philippines campaign.|$|E
5|$|Following the war, Graham {{served in}} various staff {{positions}} in <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command</b> based in New South Wales, and in 1946 he was posted to Japan on the Headquarters of the British Commonwealth Occupation Force. Promoted to lieutenant {{colonel in the}} Interim Army, he later briefly commanded the 2nd Battalion, Australian Regiment (2 AR) between 23 November 1948 and 10 January 1949. In 1949 Graham was again attached to Headquarters <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command,</b> before subsequently being posted as a tactics instructor to RMC during 1950–51. He later completed further training in the United Kingdom and Germany in 1952. Considered one of Australia's foremost tank experts, Graham commanded the 1st Armoured Regiment during 1952–53. He subsequently served as commandant of the Armoured School between 1953 and 1956, and filled the position of Director of Armour during the same period. He later wrote an influential paper on the successful use of armour in jungle warfare {{and its ability to}} reduce casualties among the infantry. Graham attended the United States Armed Forces Staff College and subsequently filled the role of Assistant Military Attaché in Washington, D.C. as an intelligence officer in 1957–58. His exposure to US military culture and intelligence during this period affected his own military thinking and would be influential during his later service. Graham was subsequently posted to Army Headquarters in Canberra in the Directorate of Military Operations and Plans in 1959.|$|E
5|$|In Oosterbeek, the {{situation}} was becoming more desperate. Hackett {{was wounded in the}} morning and had to give up the <b>eastern</b> <b>command.</b> The RAF attempted some close support around the perimeter which just held, but shelling and sniping increased casualties by the hour. The aid stations were home to some 2,000 men, both British and German as well as Dutch civilian casualties. Because many of them were actually in the front line in homes taken over earlier in the battle, the odd situation was created where casualties were evacuated forward rather than rearwards. Without evacuation, the wounded were often injured again and some posts changed hands between the British and Germans several times as the perimeter was fought over.|$|E

In August 1943, when the South East Asia Command was formed, and the Fourteenth Army was placed under it, Cariappa volunteered for active service in the war. But he was again posted as AQMG of the 26th Indian Division stationed at Buthidaung in Burma. The division {{played an important role}} in pushing the Japanese back from Arakan. For his services in the operation, Cariappa was awarded the Order of the British Empire (OBE).|$|E
5|$|Born in {{a suburb}} of Sydney, New South Wales, Howell was {{employed}} as a builder before enlisting in the Australian Imperial Force in June 1915. Allotted to the force's 1st Battalion, he served at Gallipoli prior to transferring to the Western Front. Participating in the Somme offensive of 1916, Howell was wounded at Pozières and promoted to corporal in early 1917. During an attack on a German held village, he led a rifle bombing section and was awarded the Military Medal for his actions. Severely wounded in his Victoria Cross action, Howell underwent a prolonged hospitalisation period before returning to Australia and receiving his discharge on medical grounds. Settling in Coogee, he gained employment by working on the advertising staff of several newspapers. Following the outbreak of the Second World War, Howell served with the Australian <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command</b> Headquarters but soon sought his discharge and enlisted with the United States Sea Transport Service. He died in 1964 at the age of 71.|$|E
5|$|Inspired by German and American examples, he {{successfully}} {{asked the}} council to construct a system of villas at Bexley, advocated the separate treatment of acute and chronic cases, and introduced parole-style rewards for 'industrious' patients. Like some of his earlier administrative innovations, villas became popular and inspired similar designs elsewhere. Stansfield also served in the Royal Army Medical Corps during World War I, and as a consultant on nervous diseases to the <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command.</b> Although he was appointed a CBE in 1919 for his war work, historians have drawn attention to his scepticism about shell shock, his attitudes towards eugenics and heredity, and his potentially misogynistic views about medical officers marrying. He nonetheless married twice, settling with his first wife at a house in Wimbledon where he enjoyed tending to the gardens; after her death, he married a second time in 1929 {{and moved to a}} villa in Sanremo, Italy, where he lived out his retirement.|$|E
50|$|As {{prospects}} for any enemy {{attack on the}} United States all but diminished, Central Defense Command was merged into the <b>Eastern</b> Defense <b>Command</b> on 15 January 1944. In early 1945, Southern Defense Command was also absorbed by the <b>Eastern</b> Defense <b>Command.</b>|$|R

5|$|Following the {{outbreak}} of World War II a regional command structure was subsequently adopted, with 2 MD becoming <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command,</b> 5 MD redesignated Western Command, while 1 MD in Queensland became Northern Command and the three southern states of New South Wales, Victoria and Tasmania were amalgamated into Southern Command. In {{the early years of}} the war this structure proved effective for operations overseas; however, as the threat of war with Japan grew the various commands and military districts came under greater pressure. The activation of the Militia for full-time duty after Japan's entry into the war in late 1941 compounded the situation. In response, the Army command structure was reorganised in early 1942. While Western Australia remained unchanged, Queensland, New South Wales, Victoria, Tasmania and South Australia were redesignated as Lines of Communications Areas, 7 MD became Northern Territory Force and 8 MD was redesignated as New Guinea Force. In July 1942 the Military Board's functions were assumed by the commander of the military forces, General Sir Thomas Blamey.|$|E
5|$|Pollard's early post-war roles {{involved}} recruit training, land/air warfare, administration, and planning. In 1953, he {{was promoted}} to brigadier and took command of the Australian Army Component of the British Commonwealth Forces Korea. He joined the Military Board as a major general in 1954, and was appointed a Commander of the Order of the British Empire the following year. In 1957 {{he was promoted}} to lieutenant general and took charge of <b>Eastern</b> <b>Command</b> in Sydney; two years later he was appointed a Companion of the Order of the Bath. Knighted in 1961, as Chief of the General Staff he presided over the Army's reorganisation as a pentropic structure, and worked towards making Duntroon a degree-granting institution. In 1962, he oversaw deployment of the first team of Australian military advisors to South Vietnam. After retiring from the military in 1963, Pollard became Honorary Colonel of the Royal Australian Regiment; he served as Australian Secretary to Queen Elizabeth II during the Royal Visit in 1970 and was appointed a Knight Commander of the Royal Victorian Order the same year. He died at Wyrallah, New South Wales, in 1978.|$|E
