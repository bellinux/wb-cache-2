The impact and application of the roles played by metaphors <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> have been greatly used by writers. This paper also seeks to focus on analytical and descriptive details such as looking at the students' perception of metaphors <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> as used in certain reading comprehension passages, the percentage of students who were able to interpret the precise meaning of metaphors <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> correctly, <b>and</b> lastly the interface of students' background knowledge with the presupposed meaning of metaphors <b>and</b> <b>symbols.</b> Using open-ended questions, the responses of respondents regarding the usage {{and influence of}} metaphors <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> in an ESL reading comprehension class were analysed.

The number of completed questionnaire postcards collected from patients was 1, 339 (44. 6 % of target of 3, 000). Both health care professionals and patients {{thought it was a}} good idea to print an <b>indication</b> <b>symbol,</b> a heart, <b>and</b> the product name on the preparation as a measure to prevent medication errors. Some differences were observed in the answers given to some of the questions among the former, however, indicating the importance of asking many different health care professionals to evaluate measures for preventing medication errors. Sixty percent of the patients returning the questionnaire said that they though it was a good idea to print an <b>indication</b> <b>symbol</b> <b>and</b> product name on the preparation and they had not seen any other product with this feature, but they were not particularly concerned about this. We hope that unified indication symbols will be adopted by all pharmaceutical companies and that their use will be expanded to all categories of systemic transdermal absorbent preparations in order to prevent medication errors...|$|R

However, little is known as to how health claims <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> are used by consumers in real-world shopping situations, thus making the science-based formulation of new labelling policies and the evaluation of existing ones difficult. The objective of the European Union-funded project R ole of health-related CLaims <b>and</b> <b>sYMBOLs</b> in consumer behaviour (CLYMBOL) is to determine how health-related information provided through claims <b>and</b> <b>symbols,</b> in their context, can affect consumer understanding, purchase and consumption. To do this, {{a wide range of}} qualitative and quantitative consumer research methods are being used, including product sampling, sorting studies (i. e. how consumers categorise claims <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> according to concepts such as familiarity and relevance), cross-country surveys, eye-tracking (i. e. what consumers look at and for how long), laboratory and in-store experiments, structured interviews, as well as analysis of population panel data.

Findings to date indicate the need for more structured and harmonised research on the effects of health claims <b>and</b> <b>symbols</b> on consumer behaviour, particularly taking into account country-wide differences and individual characteristics such as motivation and ability to process health-related information.
