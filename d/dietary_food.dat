50|$|Despite their reputation, most brown {{bears are}} not highly carnivorous, as they derive up to 90% of their <b>dietary</b> <b>food</b> energy from {{vegetable}} matter. Brown bears often feed {{on a variety}} of plant life, including berries, grasses, flowers, acorns (Quercus ssp.) and pine cones as well as mosses and fungi such as mushrooms. In total, over 200 plant species have been identified in their foods. Arguably the most herbivorous diets have come from the warmer temperate parts of Eurasia as more than 90% of the diet may be herbivorous. These include countries and regions such as Spain, Slovakia, most of the Balkans including Greece, Turkey, the Himalayas, and presumably the Middle East. In many inland portions of North America, the diet of grizzly bears is between 80 and 90% plant-based but animal meat can be much more important in some areas. It has been found that being restricted to a largely vegetarian diet puts constraints on the growth and size of bears who live off of them, largely because their digestive systems do not process plants as well as animal fats and proteins.|$|E

50|$|The U.S. EPA has {{examined}} <b>dietary</b> (<b>food</b> and water), non-dietary, and occupational exposure to vinclozolin or its metabolites. In general, fungicides {{have been shown}} to circulate through the water and air, and it possible for them to end up on untreated foods after application. Consumers alone cannot easily reduce their exposure because fungicides are not removed from produce that is washed with tap water. A key example of exposure to vinclozolin is through wine grapes which is considered to account for about 2% of total vinclozolin exposure. It has been determined that people may be exposed to residues of vinclozolin and its metabolites containing the 3,5-dichloroaniline moiety (3,5-DCA) through diet, and thus tolerance limits have been established for each crop. Although vinclozolin is not registered for use by homeowners, it is still possible for people to come into contact with the fungicide and its residues. For example, golfers playing on treated golf courses, and families playing on sod which has been previously treated may be at risk for exposure. Occupationally, workers can be exposed to vinclozolin while doing activities such as loading and mixing.|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>dietary</b> <b>food</b> {{fortified}} with orotic acid (1. 0 %) on liver function were studied in rats. The rats fed withorotic acid promoted liver triglyceride content markedly, that was 5 -fold {{higher than that}} of the control. The livermalondialdehyde (MDA) content increased by 10 %, but the gluthation peroxidase (GSH-Px) activity decreased by 50 %. The serum aspartate aminotransferase (AST) and alanine aminotransferase (ALT) activities increased by 25 % and 30 %,respectively. Therefore, the decreased GSH-Px activity was associated with the promotions of AST, ALT, and the liverMDA levels. In conclusion: dietary orotic acid promotes lipid peroxidation but reduces the rate of the antioxidantenzyme. Therefore, <b>dietary</b> <b>food</b> fortified with orotic acid attenuates the liver function...|$|E

40|$|Peroxisome proliferator-activated receptors (PPARs) are key nuclear receptors and {{therapeutic}} {{targets for the}} treatment of metabolic diseases through the regulation of insulin resistance, diabetes, and dyslipidemia. Although a few drugs that target PPARs have been approved, more diverse and novel PPAR ligands are necessary to improve the safety and efficacy of available drugs. To expedite the search for new natural agonists of PPARs, we developed a screening assay based on ultrafiltration liquid chromatography-mass spectrometry (LC-MS) that is compatible with complex samples such as <b>dietary</b> <b>foods</b> or botanical extracts. The known PPARα and/or PPARγ ligands resveratrol and rosiglitazone were used as positive controls to validate the developed method. When applied to the screening of an Artemisia argyi extract, eupatilin was identified as a selective PPARα ligand. A PPAR competitive binding assay based on FRET detection also confirmed eupatilin as a selective PPARα agonist exhibiting a binding affinity of 1. 18 μM (IC 50). Furthermore, eupatilin activation of the transcriptional activity of PPARα was confirmed using a cell-based transactivation assay. Thus, ultrafiltration LC-MS is a suitable assay for the identification of PPAR ligands in complex matrixes such as extracts of <b>dietary</b> <b>foods</b> and botanicals...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} <b>dietary</b> <b>food</b> {{fortified}} with vitamin B 4 on lipid profiles in serum and liver tissue were studied. Rats were paired-fed a 0. 25 % vitamin B 4 diet or a diet without vitamin B 4 for 10 days. Serum lipid levels were measured using enzyme assay kits. Lipids of liver tissues were extracted and the lipid contents were determined. A piece of liver {{was prepared to}} determine the activities of fatty acid synthase (FAS) and fatty acid β-oxidation. The results showed that animals fed a food fortified with vitamin B 4 had higher level of serum TG, PL, total cholesterol, and high density lipoprotein. Their increases were approximately by 74 %, 20 %, 27 %, and 27 %, respectively. The significant changes in liver lipid were only found in PL component.

40|$|AbstractThere is {{a general}} {{assumption}} that weight loss associated with cocaine use reflects its appetite suppressing properties. We sought to determine whether this was justified by characterizing, in detail, alterations in <b>dietary</b> <b>food</b> intake and body composition in actively using cocaine-dependent individuals. We conducted a cross-sectional case-control comparison of 65 male volunteers from the local community, half of whom satisfied the DSM-IV-TR criteria for cocaine dependence (n= 35) while the other half had no personal or family history of a psychiatric disorder, including substance abuse (n= 30). Assessments were made of eating behavior and <b>dietary</b> <b>food</b> intake, estimation of body composition, and measurement of plasma leptin. Although cocaine users reported {{significantly higher levels of}} dietary fat and carbohydrates as well as patterns of uncontrolled eating, their fat mass was significantly reduced compared with their non-drug using peers. Levels of leptin were associated with fat mass, and with the duration of stimulant use. Tobacco smoking status or concomitant use of medication did not affect the significance of the results. Weight changes in cocaine users reflect fundamental perturbations in fat regulation. These are likely to be overlooked in clinical practice but may produce significant health problems when cocaine use is discontinued during recovery...|$|E

40|$|Galactomannans can be {{employed}} in food industries to modify the final rheological properties of the products. Since they are not absorbed by the living organisms {{they can also be}} used in <b>dietary</b> <b>foods.</b> The equilibria involving the interactions of Fe(III) and galactomannans and arabinogalactan of several leguminous plants were characterized by potentiometric titrations and EPR spectroscopy. The log of the equilibrium constants for the formation of ML species, where M is the metal ion and L is the monomeric unit of the biopolymers, were 15. 4, 14. 1 and 18. 5, for the galactomannans of C. fastuosa, L. leucocephala and S. macranthera, respectively. Log K values for protonated species (MHL) were 3. 1, 3. 3, and were not detected for the galactomannan of S. macranthera. The log K values for the formation of ML 2 were 14. 1, 13. 3 and 15. 2, respectively. Early formation of insoluble products in the equilibrium with arabinogalactan and Fe(III) prevented acquisition of reliable data. The solid complexes assays showed a great dipolar interaction between two Fe(III) ions in the inner structure of the biopolymer which increased as the degree of substitution of the galactomannan decreased, and also showed the resulting thermal stability.

40|$|The {{definitive}} {{version is}} available at www. blackwell-synergy. comObjectives: To predict experience of dental pain and hospital dental general anesthetic receipt among Maori, Pacific and New Zealand European or Other (NZEO) children in New Zealand. Methods: Data were from the 2002 National Child Nutrition Survey. Models representing demographic, socio-economic status (SES), lifestyle, <b>dietary,</b> <b>food</b> security and oral health paradigms were tested using logistic regression. Results: Some 3275 children participated; 37. 4 % Mäori, 32. 3 % Pacific and 30. 3 % NZEO. Mäori children had higher odds of dental pain experience than NZEO children after adjusting for age, sex and length of time lived in New Zealand and with addition of household SES or physical factors. There were no differences in Pacific and NZEO child dental pain experience when the same factors were accounted for. The prevalence of dental general anesthetic receipt was similar among Maori, Pacific and NZEO children after adjusting for demographic, lifestyle, <b>dietary,</b> <b>food</b> security and dental factors in separate models. When such factors were investigated together, Pacific children {{were less likely to}} have received a dental general anesthetic than NZEO children. Conclusions: Maori children were more likely to experience dental pain and Pacific children were less likely to have received a dental general anesthetic than NZEO children after accounting for various behavioral and material factors.
