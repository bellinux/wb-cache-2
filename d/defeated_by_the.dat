5|$|The Indian early medieval age, 600 CE to 1200 CE, {{is defined}} by {{regional}} kingdoms and cultural diversity. When Harsha of Kannauj, who ruled much of the Indo-Gangetic Plain from 606 to 647 CE, attempted to expand southwards, he was <b>defeated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Chalukya ruler of the Deccan. When his successor attempted to expand eastwards, he was <b>defeated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Pala king of Bengal. When the Chalukyas attempted to expand southwards, they were <b>defeated</b> <b>by</b> <b>the</b> Pallavas from farther south, who in turn were opposed by the Pandyas and the Cholas from still farther south. No ruler of this period was able to create an empire and consistently control lands much beyond his core region. During this time, pastoral peoples whose land had been cleared {{to make way for}} the growing agricultural economy were accommodated within caste society, as were new non-traditional ruling classes. The caste system consequently began to show regional differences.|$|E
