50|$|The {{decreased}} {{health status}} of pigs, {{as a consequence of}} roundworm infection, is reflected in general production parameters like <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> feed conversion efficiency and meat quality. However, in farms with low infection levels, the effect of infection is expected to be minimal and the economical profitability of active Ascaris control can be questioned. It is difficult to determine the economical losses due to parasites that are not lethal. There are numerous interactions between the worm, the host, the presence of other diseases, the production system and many other factors. Recent evaluations of the economical performance of infected pig farms has indicated that the improved feed conversion, increased <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gain,</b> lower mortality and better carcass quality act in a synergetic way. Hence, strategic deworming should result in a win-win effect on economic and environmental performances with gross profit margin increases of 3 to 12 euro per average present finisher per year. To distinguish between pig populations that suffer significant economical damage and those that are less affected, we depend on the availability of diagnostic tools to provide us with information on the presence and infection pressure of this parasite on a farm. If interpreted correctly, diagnostic tools can be of use to evaluate the applied control strategies and see whether efforts for parasite control need to be increased or changed.|$|E

40|$|This thesis {{describes}} {{a study of}} the epidemiology of theileriosis on smallholder dairy farms in Murang'a District situated in central highlands of Kenya. The main objectives were: 1) to characterise different areas within the district as to their risks for tick-borne diseases (TBDs), in particular infection due to Theileria parva, and to classify the potential endemically stable and unstable areas. 2) Estimate health and productivity parameters such as infection rates, morbidity and mortality rates, dynamics of infection and growth patterns in contrasting grazing systems and agro-ecological zones (AEZs) in Murang'a District, Kenya. 3) To study the potential risk factors associated with T parva infections in cattle in smallholder dairy farms in Murang'a District of Kenya. The study was conducted in two phases. The first phase was a cross-sectional study to estimate the prevalence to tick-borne infections and was conducted between March and June 1994. The cross-sectional serological study was carried out on 750 smallholder dairy farms in Murang'a District, selected in a stratified random sampling method. One hundred and fifty farms were studied from three administrative sub locations in each of the five AEZs. These five AEZS were: Lower Highlands 1 (LH 1), (tea-dairy; altitude, 1730 - 2130 m; mean annual temperature, 15 - 18 °C; annual rainfall, 1700 - 240 Omm); Upper Midlands 1 (UM 1), (coffee-tea; altitude, 1670 - 180 Om; mean annual temperature, 18. 0 - 18. 8 °C; annual rainfall, 1700 - 190 Omm); UM 2 (main coffee; altitude, 1500 - 167 Om; mean annual temperature, 18. 8 - 19. 7 °C; annual rainfall, 1300 - 162 Omm); UM 3 (marginal coffee; altitude, 1340 - 150 Om; mean annual temperature, 19. 7 - 20. 7 °C; annual rainfall, 900 - 135 Omm); and UM 4 (sunflower-maize; altitude, 1340 - 152 Om; mean annual temperature, 19. 5 - 20. 7 °C; annual rainfall, 850 - 95 Omm). The farms had a total of 362 calves (148 males and 214 females) aged between 6 - 18 months. Prevalence of serum antibodies to three tick-borne parasites, that is T parva, T mutans and Babesia bigemina, were determined using the Enzyme-Linked Immunosorbent Assay (ELISA) technique. Antibody prevalence values significantly differed across the AEZs. The ranges of means for the antibody prevalence were: T parva (18 - 72 %), T mutans (1. 5 - 28 %) and B. bigemina (12 - 49 %). There were significant differences in serum antibody prevalence for the different TBD parasites across the fives AEZs (p o. 05). The factors significantly associated with sero-conversion to T parva in a multi-variate Glimmix model are briefly described below. Zebu breeds and their crosses with exotic breeds were associated with lower risks of seroconversion to T parva than the exotic breeds (p<O. 05). Calves whose dam antibodies were high and positive were significantly associated with higher risk of sero-conversion to T parva as were older calves than the young ones (p<O. 05). Calves that were reported to have been washed with acaricides to control ticks were associated with higher risks of sero-conversion while calf morbidity was significantly (p<O. 05) associated with higher risk of seroconversion. Calves that acquired ECF were associated with significantly (p<O. 05) lower sero-conversion risk rates that those which did not sero-convert. The presence of nymphs (total) and nymph (engorged) R. appendiculatus on calves was associated with significantly lower and higher risk of sero-conversion to T parva respectively (p<O. 05). Calf mean <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gains</b> were mainly associated with calf level factors as described below from a multi-variate mixed model. Older calves were associated with lower mean <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gains</b> than young calves, while calves with higher T parva antibody titres were associated with lower mean <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gains</b> than those with lower T parva antibody titres (p<O. 05). Calves that received concentrate feed supplements were associated with higher mean <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gains</b> than those not receiving, while Zebu and their crosses were associated with lower mean <b>weight</b> <b>gains</b> than the Taurine breeds (p<O. 05). Calves that experienced any morbidity were associated with lower mean <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gains</b> at the time of morbidity than non-affected calves (p<O. 05). Calves that experienced ECF -morbidity were associated with higher mean <b>daily</b> <b>weight</b> <b>gains</b> at the time of morbidity than non-affected calves (p<O. 05).

Different levels of anise oil were added to a standard diet, to determine its effect on feed intake, <b>daily</b> live <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> and feed conversion ratio compared to control and antibiotic groups. Two hundred day-old broilers (Ross- 308) were divided into groups of 40 birds each and randomly assigned to the five treatment diets. Each treatment has four replicates. Experimental groups were as follow: A Control group with no anise oil or antibiotic added, a 100 mg/kg Anise oil group, a 200 mg/kg Anise oil group, a 400 mg/kg Anise oil group with corresponding inclusion levels, and an antibiotic group with 0. 1 % added antibiotic (Avilamycin). The feed intake was similar in groups (p> 0. 05). The highest (p< 0. 01) <b>daily</b> live <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> was observed on the 400 Anise oil group (70. 35 g) and followed by Antibiotic group (65. 84 g), 100 Anise oil group (62. 57 g), 200 Anise oil group (62. 47 g) and control group (61. 30 g). The addition of 400 mg/kg anise oil to the diets was improved <b>daily</b> live <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> by approximately 15 % compared to the control group. This improve was remained 7 % level in antibiotic group. Additionally, the addition of 400 mg/kg anise oil to the diets was improved <b>daily</b> live <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> by approximately 6. 5 % compared to the antibiotic group. The addition of 400 mg/kg anise oil to the diets was improved feed conversion ratio by approximately 12 % compared to the control group. This improve was remained 7 % level in antibiotic group. Additionally, the addition of 400 mg/kg anise oil to the diets was improved feed conversion ratio by approximately 6 % compared to the antibiotic group. 7. In conclusion, anise oil could be considered as a potential natural growth promoter for poultry...|$|R
40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} were to quantify the apparent digestibility of the diet components and the performance of lambs consuming increasing levels of the balanced (weight) mixture of Opuntia ficus indica bran and Mimosa tenuiflora leaves and fine branches hay substituting 0, 33 and 67 % of Pennisetum purpureum hay, in a 60 % roughage fodder to 40 % concentrate diet formulated to a <b>daily</b> live body <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> of 150 g/animal. Experiment was carried out at UFCG facilities, in Patos-PB, using 18 non-emasculated lambs with (20. 4 ± 1. 16) kg (mean weight±SE). Dry matter, OM, CP, EE and total carbohydrates CD were affected by the levels of the mixture (P 0. 05). The inclusion of the mixture affected linear and positively the <b>daily</b> mean body <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> (120, 149 and 170 g/animal, respectively for 0, 33 and 67 % P. purpureum hay replacement levels), and DM, OM, CP, TCH and NFC consumptions. The balanced mixture of Opuntia ficus indica bran and Mimosa tenuiflora hay can replace up to 67 % of the roughage fodder fraction (P. purpureum) of Santa Inês lamb diet and improve the <b>daily</b> body <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> by 50 g/animal...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: This {{study was}} {{conducted}} to explore the usage of essential oil mix (EOM) in broiler nutrition as a natural growth promoting substance instead of antibiotics. Different levels of EOM were added to a standard diet, to determine its effect on feed intake, <b>daily</b> live <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> and feed conversion ratio compared to control and antibiotic groups. Two hundred and fifty five day-old broilers (Ross- 308, n = 250) were divided into five equal groups were as follow: Control group (no EOM or antibiotic), 100 ppm EOM group, 200 ppm EOM group, 400 ppm EOM group with and an Antibiotic group (0. 1 % Avilamycin). The diets were prepared freshly each day. Experiment carried out 35 days. The feed intake was similar between the groups (p> 0. 05), but the highest <b>daily</b> live <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> was observed in the 200 ppm EOM group (71. 31 g) followed by Antibiotic group (65. 84 g), 100 ppm EOM oil group (63. 40 g), control group (61. 30 g) and 400 ppm EOM group (61. 17 g). Thus, <b>daily</b> live <b>weight</b> <b>gain</b> increased in 200 ppm EOM group by approximately 16 % over the control group and approximately 8 % over the antibiotic group. Feed conversion ratio was improved in 200 ppm EOM group by approximately 12 % over the control group and approximately 6 % over the antibiotic group. The results show that, EOM could be considered as a potential natural growth promoter for poultry...|$|R
