500|$|The Web site drew media {{attention}} when the Church of Scientology's attorneys Moxon & Kobrin contacted Stollery, claiming the ScienTOMogy domain name was an infringement of their trademark, despite being a different word by one letter. [...] In September 2005, the Church of Scientology issued a {{cease and desist}} order to Stollery demanding he shut down the site and transfer ownership to the Church, threatening him with a $100,000 lawsuit. The Church's law firm stated that [...] "ScienTOMogy" [...] would cause a likelihood of confusion with [...] "Scientology," [...] violating the Lanham Act, 15 U.S.C. 1125(a). [...] The Church of Scientology's letter stated: [...] "You are hereby on notice that the registration and use of this domain name in this fashion has caused your name to be falsely associated with our clientâ€™s registered mark, SCIENTOLOGY..The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> changed one letter..does not protect you from trademark infringement." [...] Helena Kobrin, {{a lawyer for the}} Church of Scientology, was quoted as saying: [...] "You can't use somebody's trademark, regardless of what you're saying, if you haven't been given permission." ...|$|E

"And so, sir, in the lonelier {{and perhaps}} even more disheartening moments which come to any {{national}} leader, I hope {{there will be a}} corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an admiring friend, a staunch friend that will be all the way with LBJ." ...|$|E
2500|$|In July 1966, new Prime Minister Harold Holt {{expressed}} his government's {{support for the}} US {{and its role in}} Vietnam in particular. [...] "I don't know where people would choose to look for the security of this country {{were it not for the}} friendship and strength of the United States." [...] While on a visit in the same year to the US, Holt assured President Lyndon B. Johnson [...] "...I hope there is corner of your mind and heart which takes cheer from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> an admiring friend, a staunch friend, [...] that will be all the way with LBJ." ...|$|E
60|$|MRS BUILDER. My dear John, the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> {{to do your}} utmost {{is quite}} enough. I feel {{continually}} humiliated in your house, and I want to leave it--quite quietly, without fuss of any kind.|$|R
60|$|The {{musical comedy}} lyric is an {{interesting}} survival of the days, long since departed, when poets worked. As everyone knows, the only real obstacle {{in the way of}} turning out poetry by the mile was the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> to make the darned stuff rhyme.|$|R
60|$|WILLIS: 'No, I {{should think}} from the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> set the {{decanter}} {{here on the}} hearth, and put your cologne into the wood-box, you were perfectly calm, Agnes.' He takes them up and hands them to her. 'Quite as calm as usual.' The door-bell rings.|$|R
60|$|PATRICIA. I mean to {{draw your}} {{attention}} to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> recently made an offer, I accept it.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You {{come here}} and stand in Cynthia's way. You trade on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> known us all this time to monopolize her attention. You spoil her chances. You--' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well," [...] said Larry quietly, [...] "she will be Mrs. Grant to-morrow if {{you will}} lend me a horse and not mention the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> seen us when Torrance's boys come round. Where is your father?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Difficult but not impossible," [...] he insisted. [...] "I can quite {{understand}} that your {{discovery of the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> been made use of {{to assist in the}} bringing to England of treasonable documents is of itself likely to be a severe shock to you, but, if you will permit me to say so, it is not sufficient to account for your present state of nerves." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I see. You got {{the young}} lady into your service, and there Woodley was to do the courting. She {{recognized}} the drunken brute that he was, and would {{have nothing to do}} with him. Meanwhile, your arrangement was rather upset by the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> yourself fallen in love with the lady. You could no longer bear the idea of this ruffian owning her?" ...|$|R
5000|$|Having {{become a}} Young Conservative aged 14, he {{switched}} to the Social Democratic Party (SDP) while at university in 1981. In 2002, he stated: [...] "the first Thatcher Government did get a bit bogged down and it wasn't really the radical government that subsequently emerged,... And the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a completely new opportunity to wipe the slate clean, with no baggage, was a very attractive thing".|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't insult you; I'm {{incapable}} of it. I merely speak of certain facts, {{and if the}} allusion's an injury to you the fault's not mine. It's surely a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> kept all this matter quite in your own hands." ...|$|E
60|$|But what {{evidence}} have we of such sinkings? The plain <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> coal-seam above coal-seam, {{each with its}} bed of under-clay; and that therefore the land MUST have sunk ere the next bed of soil could have been deposited, and the next forest have grown on it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Uncle Dick, why don't you {{pretend to}} be terribly put out over the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> lost your {{interest}} in the claim?" [...] cried Andy. [...] "That will throw them completely off the track. Let them imagine that {{you think there is}} a lot of oil to be found there." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is unfortunate, certainly," [...] Mr. Farmer said. [...] "I do not {{see that}} under the {{circumstances}} of his introduction by an old client, and the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> seen him before, anyone could blame you for undertaking the matter. Such cases are, as you said, by no means unusual, and I am quite sure <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would not <b>have</b> undertaken it, <b>had</b> <b>you</b> considered for a moment that any injustice was being done by its provisions." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "When I {{broke my}} way out from the chamber of I-Gos I was indeed upon the verge of believing <b>that</b> <b>you</b> did hate me," [...] he said, [...] "for only hatred, it seemed to me, {{could account for the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone without making an effort to {{liberate}} me; but presently both my heart and my judgment told me that Tara of Helium could not have deserted a companion in distress, and though I still am in ignorance of the <b>facts</b> I know <b>that</b> it was beyond your power to aid me." ...|$|R
2500|$|This role, especially, invoked a {{sense of}} duty that had its roots during and before Wild's naval service. When asked in 1992 whether his {{appointment}} as Chairman rested [...] "to an extent on the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> put the division, and Australia, on the international map and <b>you</b> <b>had</b> this capacity for applying very fundamental work?", he responded, [...] "Yes, I think it certainly must have done. I don't know that I really wanted the job, but it was a duty to take the job when they offered it to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "O Charlie! how can {{you talk}} of it?" [...] said Mrs Brooke, with a distressed look. [...] "I have {{scarcely}} had time to realise the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> come home, and to thank God for it, {{when you begin to}} talk of leaving me again--perhaps for years, as before." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is not {{my belief}} in their reports," [...] replied Mr Durant, [...] "that creates {{suspicion}} in me, but I couple these reports with the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> again and again deceived me {{in regard to the}} repayment of the loans which you have already received at various times from me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course!" [...] said Mrs. Devine, with {{a little}} smile. [...] "Still, I really don't think you need be so anxious to hide the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> taken some pains to provide these little dainties for us. It would have been {{apparent}} in any case. We know how men live in the bush." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That {{part of it}} was as easy as rollin' off a log, {{after you}} boys were out of sight. I let 'em in one at a time, an' the chumps never tumbled to the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone under the canvas. They came to the {{conclusion}} <b>you</b> must <b>have</b> climbed over the fence, an' we didn't take the trouble to show them the mistake. It was a close shave, though. At one time, when I was talkin' so loud about stealing, I thought we'd have the toughest kind of a row." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You mean am I talking quite straight?" [...] and a suggestive dryness {{crept into}} Jimmy's tone. [...] "I {{can only say}} that the man, who did not know I was coming here, assured me of it just before I went to sea. It would, of course, be easy for you to wait and find out whether you could believe me. Only the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> done so would {{naturally}} place you in a difficulty, since the Agapomene would have gone to sea, and there isn't another vessel offering." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That Mr. Walkirk," [...] she said, [...] "is {{a man of}} a {{good deal}} of {{penetration}} and judgment, and if you could get one of those sisters to come here and write for you I should like it very much; and if the first one did not suit, you could try another without trouble or expense. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> a good many strings to your bow would give you ease of mind and prevent your getting discouraged. I don't want you to give up {{the idea of having a}} secretary." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Ah, no, your majesty," [...] {{replied the}} old servitor; [...] "it but makes {{assurance}} doubly sure as to your true identity, for the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> not the ring is positive proof {{that you are}} king {{and that they have}} sought to hide the fact by removing the insignia of your divine right to rule in Lutha." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "'There is one thing, Margaret. The <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> somehow {{felt when}} I {{was in trouble}} should cheer you, when I am away, for if mere danger should so affect you, surely you will know should death befall me; {{and as long as}} you do not feel that, you may be sure that I shall return safe and sound to you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|St. John {{caught at}} the hope which {{the form of}} words suggested. [...] "If {{anything}} can bring it up, {{it will be the}} <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> bought it. Such a thing would give the lie to that ridiculous story, as nothing else could. Every one will see that a house can't be very badly haunted, if the man that the ghost appeared to is willing to buy it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Dreadful things!' {{repeated}} Mrs Chick. 'Dreadful things! Is {{it not a}} <b>fact,</b> Lucretia, <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> {{just now}} been unable to command your feelings even before me, whose eyes <b>you</b> <b>had</b> so completely closed?' ...|$|R
50|$|Many {{think that}} this poem stands for one's {{reflection}} on their past life. The poem questions whether you valued your life over death or, worse, never having been born. Did you in fact see life {{for all of its}} beauty or do you view your life as a waste? The poem asks you to analyze your life, to question whether every decision you made was for the greater good, and to learn and accept the decisions <b>you</b> <b>have</b> made in your life. One Answer to the Question would be simply to value the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the opportunity to live.|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have said}} the last word which it is {{possible}} for me to say upon the subject," [...] he declared. [...] "You will understand, I am sure, that I am not here in the character of an inquisitor. I simply thought it my duty, in view of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> made yourself the social sponsor for Mr. Lessingham, to place certain information before you, and to ask, unofficially, of course, if <b>you</b> <b>have</b> any explanation to give? You may even," [...] he went on, hesitatingly, [...] "appreciate the motives which led me to do so." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{have quite}} made up your mind, then, {{to put the}} Tredowen {{property}} on the market," [...] he remarked. [...] "You will excuse my reminding you of the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> large accumulated funds in hand, and nearly a hundred thousand pounds worth of easily realizable securities. Tredowen has been in your mother's family for a good many years, and I should doubt {{whether it will be}} easily disposed of." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "You are a queer man, Mr. Merrick," [...] he said, quietly. [...] "I {{can only}} excuse your insults {{on the grounds}} of ignorance, or the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been misinformed. Here is the {{newspaper}} report of the Almaquo fire, which I showed my friends the night of Captain Wegg's sudden death." [...] He took a clipping from a drawer of the desk and handed it to Uncle John, who read it carefully.|$|E
6000|$|... "These we will peruse and {{consider}} at our leisure," [...] the queen said, [...] "and I shall, I hope, {{see you at}} my levee this evening. In the meantime I {{thank you for your}} service in having brought the despatches so speedily here, and am well aware that the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>have</b> been chosen as the messengers of the commander-in-chief is in itself a proof that your share in the battle was in the highest degree honourable." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Naturally, Miss Hardy, the {{statement}} appears a strange one to you; {{but the fact}} is I made a promise to deliver a message to you. I found upon reaching England <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> left; I obtained your address at Cairo, and went there only to find <b>you</b> <b>had</b> left a fortnight before my arrival; then I followed you to Naples, and was a week too late. At Rome I missed you by a day, and as I could not learn there, at your hotel, where you were going next, beyond the <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> gone North, I have been hunting for you ever since." ...|$|R
60|$|AUGUSTA (after a pause). I've never {{approved}} of Dr. Findar employing you here. I warned him against you--I told him <b>that</b> <b>you</b> would betray his kindness as you betrayed mine, but he wouldn't listen to me. I {{told him that}} {{a girl who was}} capable of drawing my son into an intrigue while {{she was a member of}} the church and of my Bible class, a girl who <b>had</b> the career <b>you</b> <b>had</b> in Newcastle, couldn't become a decent and trustworthy woman. The very <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> <b>had</b> the audacity to come back to Foxon Falls and impose on Dr. Pindar's simplicity, proves it.|$|R
6000|$|The {{surveyor}} {{smiled a}} little. [...] "Gentlemen," [...] he said slowly, [...] "you have all heard conflicting rumours, but I {{have had a}} message, {{and you can take}} it as a <b>fact</b> <b>that</b> <b>you</b> will <b>have</b> the steel road very shortly." ...|$|R
