5|$|In chapter nine, Marita's Bargain, Gladwell {{advances}} {{the notion}} that the success of students of different cultures or different socio-economic backgrounds is in fact highly correlated to the time students spent in school or in educationally rich environments. He describes the Knowledge is Power Program (KIPP) which helps students from about 50 inner-city schools across the United States achieve much better results than other inner-city schools' students and explains that their success {{stems from the fact that}} they simply spent more hours at school <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>year</b> and the summer. Gladwell also analyzes a five-year study done by Karl Alexander of Johns Hopkins University, demonstrating that summer holidays have a detrimental effect on students of disadvantaged backgrounds, who paradoxically progress more <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>year</b> than students from the highest socio-economic group.|$|E

5|$|Brown {{moved into}} an on-campus {{boarding}} house at 61 East Eleventh Avenue in the primarily black neighborhood of the University District in Columbus, and majored in architectural engineering.

He {{took a job as a}} janitor at a local Lazarus department store and then was hired by the Pennsylvania Railroad to load boxcars from 15:30 to midnight each day. In spite of this, he maintained top grades in his classes. Facing difficulties with his academics and the institutional segregation in the city, Brown nevertheless found most of his fellow students were friendly toward him. Brown rarely returned to Mississippi <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>year,</b> but in the summers he worked at a dry cleaner in Hattiesburg to help pay for his classes.|$|E
5|$|When Nolan's family {{relocated}} to Chicago during his formative years, he started making films with Adrien and Roko Belic. He has continued his {{collaboration with the}} brothers, receiving a credit for his editorial assistance on their Oscar-nominated documentary Genghis Blues (1999). Nolan also worked alongside Roko (and future Pulitzer Prize winner Jeffrey Gettleman) on documenting a safari across four African countries, organized by the late photojournalist Dan Eldon in the early 1990s. Nolan was educated at Haileybury and Imperial Service College, an independent school in Hertford Heath, Hertfordshire, and later read English literature at University College London (UCL). He chose UCL specifically for its filmmaking facilities, which comprised a Steenbeck editing suite and 16mm film cameras. Nolan {{was president of the}} Union's Film Society, and with Emma Thomas (his girlfriend and future wife) he screened 35 mm feature films <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>year</b> and used the money earned to produce 16 mm films over the summers. During his college years, Nolan made two short films. The first was the surreal 8 mm Tarantella (1989), which was shown on Image Union (an independent film and video showcase on the Public Broadcasting Service). The second was Larceny (1995), filmed over a weekend in black and white with a limited cast, crew, and equipment. Funded by Nolan and shot with the society's equipment, it appeared at the Cambridge Film Festival in 1996 and is considered one of UCL's best shorts.|$|E

40|$|Extract] This chapter {{analyses}} {{the need}} for HIV-prevention programmes in <b>the</b> Caribbean <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>years.</b> It also explores what programme characteristics {{would be the best}} suited to be vehicles for such education. The analysis considers the following questions: • Is HIV education relevant for school-aged children? • Is achieving sustained, widespread protective behaviours realistic, given that sexual behaviours are so deep seated? • Is it appropriate to have programmes that aim to produce widespread protective behaviours <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>school</b> <b>years?</b> • Is there evidence that these programmes will have positive effects on children and the epidemic? • What would such programmes look like? • How well positioned is the Caribbean education sector to contribute? The evidence in support of HIV programmes that target school-aged children is compelling...|$|R
