25|$|In the {{aftermath}} of the Invergordon Mutiny in September 1931, Tyrwhitt was instrumental in preventing Vice-Admiral Frederic Dreyer, the Deputy Chief of Naval Staff, from taking command of the Atlantic Fleet and ending any hopes Dreyer had of becoming First Sea Lord. Tyrwhitt was appointed First and Principal Naval Aide-de-Camp on 10 October 1932. When <b>he</b> <b>hauled</b> down his flag for the last time in May 1933, Tyrwhitt was the last British flag officer who had served in the First World War to do so. Promoted to Admiral of the Fleet on 31 July 1934, he briefly served in the Home Guard during the Second World War. He died at Ellenden Nursing Home in Sandhurst, Kent on 30 May 1951.|$|E

25|$|Having secured almost 15,000 {{marks from}} the Society of Friends of Nature Institution of Berlin, the Rudolf Virchow Foundation of Berlin, and King Frederick Augustus III of Saxony, Hantzsch was {{prepared}} to spend three years on Baffin Island. According to The New York Times, this trip aroused keen interest in the scientific community. He set off in 1909, and encountered disaster when his ship, the Janthina Agatha, hit ice in Cumberland Sound and sank, losing most of its cargo. Hantzsch and the entire crew found refuge on Blacklead Island. With the assistance of some Inuit, <b>he</b> <b>hauled</b> a boat to Nettilling Lake, reaching it June of the following year. They reached Kokdjuak River {{at the end of}} August, and Foxe Channel at the end of September, becoming the first European to cross Baffin Island.|$|E
25|$|Immediately {{after the}} {{surrender}} of Japan, 54 ships of the Third Fleet returned to the United States, with Halsey's four-star flag flying from the USS South Dakota, for the annual Navy Day Celebrations in San Francisco on October 27, 1945. <b>He</b> <b>hauled</b> down his flag in November of that year and was assigned special duty {{in the office of}} the Secretary of the Navy. On December 11, 1945, he took the oath as Fleet Admiral, becoming the fourth and still the most recent naval officer awarded that rank. Fleet Admiral Halsey made a goodwill flying trip, passing by Central and South America, covering nearly 28,000 miles and 11 nations. He retired from active service in March 1947 but, as a Fleet Admiral, he was not taken off active duty status.|$|E
25|$|Then on 25 September 1801 a {{privateer}} hoisting the Spanish flag unsuccessfully engaged Pickle in a single-ship {{action that}} resulted in the death of her commander, Lieutenant Greenshields, and the wounding of Midshipman Pierce, the master, Thomas Hayer, and seven others of her crew. At 11am, some five or six miles NW of the Isle of Ash (aka Île à Vache or Cow Island, south of Hispaniola), Pickle sighted a vessel flying the British flag and sailing towards it. When the vessel got within pistol-shot, <b>he</b> <b>hauled</b> up the Spanish flag and opened fire. The fight lasted an hour and a quarter, with a musket ball through the body killing Greenshields about 40 minutes in. The Spanish vessel then tried to board Pickle, but when the Spaniard was unable to do so, he fled. Pickle chased the privateer {{for an hour and a}} half but the privateer was faster and Pickle gave up the chase. Hayer, who wrote the report of the action, described the privateer as having two 12-pounder and two 9-pounder guns, and a crew of about 70 men. Pickle had a crew of 35, of whom three were incapacitated by illness.|$|E

25|$|Over {{four weeks}} in December and January, <b>he</b> <b>hauled</b> loads up the mountain, entirely alone above his advance base camp at 5300m, but {{was forced to}} retreat from the col at Makalu La by strong winds, which {{destroyed}} his tent and twice blew him into the air. However, after two weeks at base camp the weather improved, and on 24 January he set off up the mountain. His only means of communication was a satellite phone, which he used to speak to his wife several times a day. By {{the morning of the}} 27th he was camped on a small ledge around 1000m below the summit, and told his wife that he would try to reach the top that day. He was never heard from again. Alone on the mountain in winter, with no climbers in the world sufficiently acclimatised to reach his high camp, there was no possibility of a rescue attempt. His base camp team gave up hope of him returning alive after he had been missing for a week, and a later helicopter flight over the mountain failed to find any sign of him. His body has not been found and his exact fate is unknown. He left his wife, Katia, and two children.|$|E
500|$|Following the England tour, the Australians {{returned}} home via a tour to the Indian subcontinent. The first stop was Karachi, where Australia played its first ever Test against Pakistan. Lindwall's poor run continued, scoring {{two and a}} duck and taking match figures of 1/64 as Australia fell to a nine wicket defeat. The team travelled to Madras {{for the first of}} three Tests in India. Lindwall briefly bowled on the first morning without success before succumbing to a severe stomach bug. He took no further part in the first innings and spent the next two days in bed. Lindwall briefly got out of his bed on day three to bat, making only eight as Australia took a 158 run first innings lead. <b>He</b> <b>hauled</b> himself out of bed on the fourth day, and cut through the Indians in three spells, taking 7/43 in an innings victory.|$|E

2500|$|There were {{numerous}} {{reports in the}} media of Atta and Shehhi going to Shuckum's Oyster Pub and Seafood Grill, a sports bar in Hollywood, Florida, on September 8, 2001. Atta, Shehhi, and a third unidentified man reportedly drank heavily and played the Golden Tee '97 arcade game there. The bartender said [...] "Atta drank vodka and orange juice, while Shehhi preferred rum and cokes, five drinks apiece. They were wasted [...]" [...] Manager Tony Amos described, [...] "The guy Mohamed was drunk, his voice was slurred {{and he had a}} thick accent." [...] Bartender Patricia Idrissi said the men argued over the bill, and when she asked if there was a problem, [...] "Mohamed said he worked for American Airlines and he could pay his bill." [...] Atta said, [...] "I have plenty of money. I'm a pilot." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>hauled</b> a wad of $50 and $100 bills from his pocket, eventually leaving a $3 tip. However, Atta flew on US Airways Flight 2719 to Baltimore at approximately 3:15 p.m. on September 7 from Fort Lauderdale, and therefore could not have been at Shuckum's that evening. On September 8, Atta was in Laurel, Maryland, where he went to a Safeway grocery store to wire $2850 to Mustafa Muhammad Ahmad in Dubai, and sent another $5000 to Ahmed from a Giant Food store in Laurel on the same day. On September 9, Atta flew on to Boston.|$|E
2500|$|The {{top of the}} {{mountain}} of St.John was already fortified during Illyrian times. In the 6th century the emperor Justinian I reconstructed the fortress. [...] With the retreat of the Byzantines, eventually and in spite of numerous incursions some independence was attained, however this had no lasting effects upon the fortifications. This changed when in 1420 the then independent Republic of Cattaro succumbed to [...] Venetian rule. As part of Albania Veneta the fortifications received their current structure. [...] During this time there were two successful Ottoman sieges [...] followed by occupations, 1538 – 1571 and 1657 – 1699. In 1797 the fortifications passed to the Habsburg Monarchy with the Treaty of Campo Formio. In 1805, Kotor was assigned to the French Empire's client state, the Napoleonic Kingdom of Italy by the Treaty of Pressburg, but occupied by Russian troops under Dmitry Senyavin until they left after the Treaty of Tilsit in 1807. Three years later it was incorporated into the French Empire's Illyrian Provinces. The fortifications (then named Cattaro) were attacked by the British naval Captain William Hoste with his ship HMS Bacchante (38 guns). In an [...] "unmilitary manner" [...] <b>he</b> <b>hauled</b> his ships' cannon to positions above the fort using block and tackle and started the shelling. After a ten-day siege, the French garrison had no alternative and surrendered on January 5, 1814. With the Congress of Vienna Kotor was returned to the Austrian Empire. After their defeat in World War I the Austrians left and the fortress was no longer manned. During World War II Kotor was occupied by the Axis forces and liberated on November 21, 1944, a date commemorated over the Sea Gate.|$|E
