5|$|Although the {{accident}} rate per 100 million miles for professional truckers is low, {{the high number}} of miles driven by a truck driver makes truck driving a risky occupation. Trucking transportation occupations accounted for one quarter of all work-related fatalities in 2015, more than any other U.S. job, according to the U.S. Labor Department’s Bureau of Labor Statistics' annual workplace fatality report. The <b>fatal</b> <b>injury</b> rate in 2015 was 14.7 per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers in transportation and material moving occupations (which includes both truckers and air transportation workers.) This was a significantly lower rate than for workers in farming, fishing, and forestry occupations, but high compared to most other occupation categories. The report did not break out the <b>fatal</b> <b>injury</b> rate per 100,000 full-time equivalent workers among aircraft pilots and flight engineers but did note that they had a high <b>fatal</b> <b>injury</b> rate compared to all workers. There were 57 fatalities among aircraft pilots and flight engineers in 2015.|$|E

5|$|Byzantines were avid {{players of}} tavli (Byzantine Greek: τάβλη), a game known in English as backgammon, {{which is still}} popular in former Byzantine realms, and still known by the name tavli in Greece. Byzantine nobles were devoted to horsemanship, {{particularly}} tzykanion, now known as polo. The game came from Sassanid Persia in the early period and a Tzykanisterion (stadium for playing the game) was built by Theodosius II (r. 408–450) inside the Great Palace of Constantinople. Emperor Basil I (r. 867–886) excelled at it; Emperor Alexander (r. 912–913) died from exhaustion while playing, Emperor Alexios I Komnenos (r. 1081–1118) was injured while playing with Tatikios, and John I of Trebizond (r. 1235–1238) died from a <b>fatal</b> <b>injury</b> during a game. Aside from Constantinople and Trebizond, other Byzantine cities also featured tzykanisteria, most notably Sparta, Ephesus, and Athens, an indication of a thriving urban aristocracy. The game {{was introduced to the}} West by crusaders, who developed a taste for it particularly during the pro-Western reign of emperor Manuel I Komnenos.|$|E

40|$|Objective: Young skiers are at {{increased}} risk for injury, however, epidemiological data on skiing related <b>fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> among child skiers are scarce. This study aimed to provide information needed to develop injury control and prevention programs. Design and setting: Study subjects came from Colorado, USA and were identified using a death certificate based surveillance system. <b>Fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> were limited to events that occurred at established commercial ski resorts in Colorado, and subjects were classified as child skiers (0 – 17 years) or adult skiers (> 18 years). Main outcome measure: Type and external cause, time, and week day of injury, gender and residency of the decedents. Results: During the study period from 1980 – 2001, 149 <b>fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> associated with downhill skiing were identified; 21 (14. 1 %) occurred among child skiers aged (17 years. The age of the youngest decedent was 7 years. In females the proportion of <b>fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> among child skiers was nearly three times that of adults. Traumatic brain injuries were {{the leading cause of death}} (67 % of all deaths) among children, while multiple internal injuries and traumatic brain injuries accounted for almost equal proportions of <b>fatal</b> <b>injuries</b> among adults.

He often gave public readings from Walter Jenka's essay Schwierigkeiten mit der Wahrheit (Difficulties with the Truth, 1989) at the Deutsches Theater, before the book was permitted to be published in East Germany. On 4 November 1989 shortly before the fall of the Berlin Wall, in front of half a million people during the Alexanderplatz demonstration, he declared the Communists' monopoly on power to be invalid. In the same year he became internationally known after playing, next to Armin Mueller-Stahl and Klaus Maria Brandauer, the leading role in Bernhard Wicki's Das Spinnennetz (The Spider's Web, based on the expressionist, fragmentary novel of the same name by Austrian writer Joseph Roth) right-wing lieutenant Lohse who sleeps and murders his way to professional success in the early Weimar Republic following a near <b>fatal</b> <b>injury</b> during the Wilhelmshaven mutiny of 29 October 1918.|$|E
5|$|It is not {{possible}} to confirm whether some injuries took place before or after death, due to the body's state of decay. This is the case for the wound in the upper right chest and the laceration {{on the back of the}} skull. The cut on the right of the neck may have been the result of the body becoming bloated, causing the skin to split; however, the straight edges to the wound suggest that it may have been caused by a sharp instrument, such as a knife. The ligature marks on the neck may have occurred after death. In some interpretations of Lindow Man's death, the sinew is a garrotte used to break the man's neck. However, Robert Connolly, a lecturer in physical anthropology, suggests that the sinew may have been ornamental and that ligature marks may have been caused by the body swelling when submerged. The rib fracture may also have occurred after death, perhaps during the discovery of the body, but is included in some narratives of Lindow Man's death. The broken neck would have proven the <b>fatal</b> <b>injury,</b> whether caused by the sinew cord tightening around the neck or by blows to the back of the head. After death, Lindow Man was deposited into Lindow Moss face down.|$|E

25|$|Polo {{originates}} {{from ancient}} Persia. Its invention is dated variously from the 6th century BC to the 1st century AD.

A tzykanisterion (stadium for playing tzykanion, the Byzantine name for polo) was built by emperor Theodosius II (r. 408–450) inside the Great Palace of Constantinople. Emperor Basil I (r. 867–886) excelled at it; Emperor Alexander (r. 912–913) died from exhaustion while playing and John I of Trebizond (r. 1235–1238) died from a <b>fatal</b> <b>injury</b> during a game.

25|$|The {{ability to}} sit upright was an {{important}} requirement for test animals in order that another common <b>fatal</b> <b>injury</b> among human victims, decapitation, could be studied.

While knobs, levers, and buttons are essential in the operation of a vehicle, which design modifications would best ensure that these elements did not tear or puncture victims in a crash.
