60|$|A silence {{had fallen}} in the room-very queer and complete. The little girl nursed her doll, the soldier gazed at the floor, the woman's mouth moved stealthily, and in Noel the thought rushed {{continually}} to the verge of action: 'Couldn't <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> run downstairs?' But she sat on, hypnotised by that silence, till Lavendie reappeared with a bottle and four glasses.|$|E

At one side of the park I could see the lights in the streets and houses; and I was thinking how happy them folks was who could chase the duck and smoke their pipes at their windows, and keep cool and pleasant like nature intended for 'em to.|$|R

60|$|I {{should be}} quite ashamed {{of not having}} written to you and my dear Mrs. Fields before now, if I didn't know that you will both {{understand}} how occupied I am, and how naturally, when I put my papers away for the day, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> fly. I have a large room here, with three fine windows, overlooking the Park--unsurpassable for airiness and cheerfulness.|$|E

O, I defend myself. I wouldn’t take a fault at another person’s hands, no, not if I had it on my forehead. And that’s what you must do, if you mean to live it out. But, indeed, I never heard such nonsense. I should think you was ashamed of yourself! You’re bald, then, I suppose?’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "We {{must make}} a night of it, since to-morrow we die.... You would curb licence from without--I from within. When <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> when I go to bed, when I draw a breath, see a face, or a flower, or a tree--if I didn't feel that I was looking on the Deity, I believe I should quit this palace of varieties, from sheer boredom. You, I understand, can't look on your God, unless you {{withdraw}} into some high place. Isn't it a bit lonely there?" ...|$|E

Well, I run, meeting no one in night, till I come to pass, run up it, and find guards, to whom I tell story, so they not kill me, but let me through, and at last I come here, quite safe, without Fung wife, thank God, and that end of tale." ...|$|E
60|$|One huge wave catches {{me up and}} chucks me in {{a sitting}} posture, as hard as ever it can, down on to a rock which has been put there for me. And, before I’ve said “Oh! Ugh!” and found out what has gone, the wave comes back and carries me out to mid-ocean. I begin to strike out frantically for the shore, and wonder if I shall ever see home and friends again, and wish I’d been kinder to my little sister when a boy (when I was a boy, I mean). Just when I have given up all hope, a wave retires and leaves me {{sprawling}} like a star-fish on the sand, and <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> look back and find that I’ve been swimming for my life in two feet of water. I hop back and dress, and crawl home, where I have to pretend I liked it.|$|E
60|$|We've {{lived in}} our cottage two weeks, and every morning when <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> open our windows, which has little panes set in strips of lead, and hinges {{on one side}} so that it works like a door, and {{look out over the}} brook and the meadows and the {{thatched}} roofs, and see the peasant men with their short jackets and woollen caps, and the lower part of their trousers tied round with twine, if they don't happen to have leather leggings, trudging to their work, my soul is filled with welling emotions as I think that if Queen Elizabeth ever travelled along this way she must have seen these great old trees and, perhaps, some of these very houses; and as to the people, they must have been pretty much the same, though differing a little in clothes, I dare say; but, judging from Hannah, perhaps not very much in the kind of English they spoke.|$|E
6000|$|... "I an't {{so sure of}} that," [...] {{returned}} Mrs. Lander fondly. [...] "He {{would if}} you was the one. I declare I believe <b>I</b> could <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> walk right off, I feel so well." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "All {{their songs}} are sad. George says the {{primitive}} love-songs {{of all races}} are the same. But Two Horns has the fire going, <b>and</b> <b>I</b> must <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> superintend breakfast. You need not rise till I call." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Every morning, my bright boy, <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> say to myself, 'Well! I reckon it's {{about time}} to take the route for London;' and every morning, if you'll believe me, I put it off till next day. Whether it's in the good feeding (expensive, I admit; but when your cook helps you to digest instead of {{hindering}} you, a man of my dyspeptic nation is too grateful to complain)--or whether it's in the air, which reminds me, I do assure you, of our native atmosphere at Coolspring, Mass., is more than I can tell, with a hard steel pen on a leaf of flimsy paper. You have heard the saying, 'When a good American dies, he goes to Paris'. Maybe, sometimes, he's smart enough to discount his own death, and rationally enjoy the future time in the present. This you see is a poetic light. But, mercy be praised, the moral of my residence in Paris is plain:--If I can't go to Amelius, Amelius must come to me. Note the address Grand Hotel; and pack up, like a good boy, on receipt of this. Memorandum: The brown Miss is here. I saw her taking the air in a carriage, and raised my hat. She looked the other way.|$|E

6000|$|... "This pilgrimage of ours," [...] he said, presently, [...] "has {{made for}} magnanimity. This day {{particularly}} {{has been a}} good day. When we stood on this old wall here in the sunset I seemed to be standing outside myself in an immense still sphere of past and future. I stood with my feet upon the Stone Age and saw myself four thousand years away, and all my distresses as very little incidents in that perspective. Away there in London the case is altogether different; after three hours or so of the Committee one concentrates into one little inflamed moment of personality. There is no past any longer, there is no future, there is only the rankling dispute. For all those three hours, perhaps, I have been thinking of just what I had to say, just how I had to say it, just how I looked while I said it, just how much I was making myself understood, how I might be misunderstood, how I might be misrepresented, challenged, denied. One draws in more and more as one is used up. At last one is reduced to a little, raw, bleeding, desperately fighting, pin-point of SELF.... One goes back to one's home unable to recover.

60|$|Ever since I {{came the}} wind has been blowing a gale on this furthermost, lonely, melancholy coast, as if I had got {{not only to the}} Land's End, but {{to the end of the}} world itself, to the {{confines}} of Old Chaos his kingdom, a region where the elements are in everlasting conflict. Two or three times during the afternoon I have resolutely put on my cap and water-proof and gone out to face it, only to be quickly driven in again by the bitter furious blast. Yet it was almost as bad indoors to have to sit and listen by the hour to its ravings. From time to time <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> look through the window-pane at the few cold grey naked cottages and empty bleak fields, divided by naked grey stone fences, and, beyond the fields, the foam-flecked, colder, greyer, more desolate ocean. Would it be better, I wonder, to fight my way down to those wave-loosened masses of granite by the sea, where I would hear the roar and thunder of the surf instead of this perpetual insane howling and screaming of the wind round the house? I turn from the window with a shiver; a splash of rain hurled against it has blotted the landscape out; I go back once more to my comfortable easy-chair by the fire. Patience! Patience! By and by, I say to myself--I say it many times over--daylight will be gone; then the lamp will be brought in, the curtains drawn, and tea will follow, with buttered toast and other good things. Then the solacing pipe, and thoughts and memories and some pleasant waking drawn to while away the time.|$|E
60|$|Harry did not know, he said. He was in {{the hands}} of Heaven and Fate; but more lonely now, as it seemed to him, than he had been all the rest of his life; and that night, as he lay in his little room which he still occupied, the boy thought with many a pang of shame and grief of his strange and solitary condition: how he had a father and no father; a nameless mother that had been brought to ruin, perhaps, by that very father whom Harry could only {{acknowledge}} in secret and with a blush, and whom he could neither love nor revere. And he sickened to think how Father Holt, a stranger, and two or three soldiers, his acquaintances of the last six weeks, were the only friends he had in the great wide world, where he was now quite alone. The soul of the boy was full of love, and he longed as he lay in the darkness there for some one upon whom he could bestow it. He remembers, and must to his dying day, the thoughts and tears of that long night, the hours tolling through it. Who was he, and what? Why here rather than elsewhere? I have a mind, he thought, to go to that priest at Trim, and find out what my father said to him on his death-bed confession. Is there any child in the whole world so unprotected as I am? Shall <b>I</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>and</b> quit this place, and run to Ireland? With these thoughts and tears the lad passed that night away until he wept himself to sleep.|$|E
