25|$|The Last Train From Hiroshima: The Survivors Look Back and its revised {{second edition}} To Hell and Back: The Last Train From Hiroshima {{is a book}} by American author Charles R. Pellegrino and {{published}} on January 19, 2010 by Henry Holt and Company that documents life in Hiroshima and Nagasaki in the time immediately preceding, during and following {{the aftermath of the}} atomic bombings of Japan. The story focuses on individuals such as Tsutomu Yamaguchi, a hibakusha (explosion-affected person) who was the only person confirmed by the government of Japan to have survived the pika-don (<b>flash-bang)</b> of both attacks. The story of the impacts in Japan on the residents of the two targeted cities and of the response of the Japanese government to the attack is interwoven with details of the Americans who carried out the missions and their reactions to the damage they had wrought.|$|E
50|$|On March 7, 2012, {{during a}} sit-in {{demonstration}} blocking {{front of the}} Loto-Québec (lottery) head office, police deployed tear gas and <b>flash-bang</b> grenades against over 1,000 protesters. One demonstrator's eye was seriously wounded by what he and other demonstrators stated was a <b>flash-bang</b> grenade launched by police. According to the student's father, police investigators sought to demonstrate the wound {{was caused by a}} snowball.|$|E
5000|$|Liber Ka : {{alternative}} {{rules for}} magic, {{of the western}} ceremonial type (subtler effects, no Hollywood <b>flash-bang</b> magic).|$|E
5000|$|In recent years, the MAT {{have been}} {{equipped}} with stockings, plastic material and other components that protect the torso {{of the body}} (mainly shoulders and arms) from hits. Each man also bears his service weapon, gas masks (in backpack hanging on the shoulder), {{a sufficient number of}} tear gas and <b>flash-bangs,</b> handcuffs. Some of the squad members have a fire each. One or two in each squad have a special tear gas spray (known as [...] "bellows") and do not carry a shield. When the platoon is on hold or perform custodial tasks, riot the MAT wear black berets instead of helmets.|$|R
50|$|The search yielded no drugs, no {{drug dealer}} and no weapons, {{and the drug}} dealer was arrested the next day {{without the use of}} <b>flash-bang</b> grenades.|$|E
50|$|Police closed nearby streets, and shoppers were {{evacuated}} from neighboring stores as dozens {{of police officers}} and other emergency crews surrounded the restaurant. Police threw a <b>flash-bang</b> grenade inside and exchanged gunfire with Benitez, killing him. Benitez was declared dead at the Chinese restaurant in an El Monte strip mall. His son {{was shot in the}} thigh but survived.|$|E
5000|$|It {{received}} mixed reviews, {{with the}} Guardian describing it as [...] "a debut of rare accomplishment", and Strange Horizons describing it as having [...] "a pretty good twisty plot {{at the core}} of the novel—but sadly ... buried underneath layers of cinematic <b>flash-bang</b> frippery and clunky long-winded exposition." [...] SF Signal described it as [...] "not always successful, but ... definitely a promising start." ...|$|E
5000|$|The M5 modular {{crowd control}} munition (MCCM) is a {{non-lethal}} direct fire device used to disperse, incapacitate and deny area access to {{large groups of}} people with percussion and flash (<b>flash-bang)</b> along with the impact from 600 high-velocity rubber or plastic balls moving outwards towards the crowd. It can be deployed and set up by troops (mounted or dismounted) and detonated via a command wire.|$|E
5000|$|The trainer {{for both}} {{challenges}} was Craig [...] "Sawman" [...] Sawyer, Navy SEALs instructor and former sniper. The Browning Automatic Rifle (B.A.R.) {{was designed for}} advancing infantrymen to sling over the shoulder and fire from the hip, a technique called [...] "walking fire". The Milkor USA M32A1 MSGL can fire a variety of rounds like parachuting video camera, infra-red flares, and smoke or <b>flash-bang</b> rounds.|$|E
50|$|The Ripsaw is {{intended}} to perform various missions including convoy protection, perimeter defense, surveillance, rescue, border patrol, crowd control, and explosive ordnance disposal. For perimeter defense or crowd control, a belt of M5 Modular Crowd Control Munitions (MCCM) can be mounted around the vehicle to break up crowds or non-lethally engage personnel with <b>flash-bang</b> effects and rubber bullets. Cameras provide 360-degree coverage for situational awareness for the operator.|$|E
50|$|Sandy {{said when}} interviewed {{that he had}} wanted to arrest Boyd before {{complete}} nightfall, to avoid the problems that darkness would bring. He threw a <b>flash-bang</b> grenade toward Boyd, but it bounced and, according to Sandy, landed in a rocky area to Boyd's right. Officer Rick Ingram fired a Taser shotgun at Boyd, but this did not appear to have any effect. Ingram said later that he had already called for a beanbag shotgun because he knew the Taser would not work. Trial testimony later showed that Boyd was wearing multiple layers of clothing when he was shot, and that one of the Taser probes was returned to police by the medical examiner with Boyd's clothing. Weimerskirch released the police dog to bite Boyd but it was distracted, possibly by the flight and explosion of the <b>flash-bang.</b> In a deposition for the civil rights lawsuit brought by Boyd's family, Weimerskirch said he believed the dog might have been shocked by a Taser probe. As the dog ran up to him, Boyd dropped the bags he had picked up and retrieved his knives from his pockets. With one knife in each hand, he assumed a squared off stance. Officers then ordered Boyd to drop the two knives several times, but he did not comply.|$|E
5000|$|Police {{executed}} a no-knock, pre-dawn raid at 2:25am, with a SWAT team breaching a {{door with a}} ram and throwing a <b>flash-bang</b> stun grenade into {{a room with a}} 19 month old child. The grenade exploded inside the infant's crib, igniting the crib and his pillow, causing [...] "blast burn injuries to the face and chest; a complex laceration of the nose, upper lip and face; 20% of the right upper lip missing; the external nose being separated from the underlying bone; and a large avulsion burn injury to the chest with a resulting left pulmonary contusion and sepsis" ...|$|E
50|$|Later in the evening, a {{group of}} protesters took over a vacant {{building}} that once served as {{the headquarters of the}} Traveler's Aid Society, a non-profit organization that provided services to the local homeless population. Police soon arrived to break up the protesters gathered outside of the building. Some protesters fled while others set a barricade on fire. Just after midnight, police ordered the crowd to disperse for unlawful assembly. Soon, one officer on Broadway was struck on his face shield by a bottle, disorienting him. Within a minute, officers launched <b>flash-bang</b> grenades and tear-gas canisters, beginning a series of late-night clashes between the demonstrators and police.|$|E
50|$|The police {{presence}} was minimal during the strike, and most protesters {{had gone home}} by 11 p.m. when dozens of protesters took over a building that once housed the nonprofit Travelers Aid Society, and started a massive trash fire at 16th and Broadway that sent flames 15 feet high. Just after midnight, police declared the protest an unlawful assembly and ordered the crowd to disperse. After one officer was struck on his face shield by a bottle, officers used <b>flash-bang</b> grenades and tear-gas canisters to attempt to disperse the crowd. A series of clashes between protesters and police continued throughout the night with 103 people arrested in total.|$|E
5000|$|Scott Campbell was video {{recording}} {{members of the}} Oakland Police Department during an Occupy Oakland protest {{on the night of}} November 2-3, 2011. Shortly before 1am on November 3, he was shot by police using a less-lethal round while he was filming a stationary line of police in riot gear, hours after the 2011 Oakland general strike but during ongoing street clashes between protestors and police in what the San Francisco Chronicle described as [...] "chaos after midnight. Masked vandals shattered windows, set fires and plastered downtown businesses with graffiti before police moved in, dispersing crowds with tear gas and <b>flash-bang</b> grenades and making dozens of arrests." ...|$|E
5000|$|One officer {{dropped a}} <b>flash-bang</b> grenade down the bulldozer's exhaust pipe, with no {{immediate}} apparent effect. Local and state patrol, including a SWAT team, walked behind and beside the bulldozer occasionally firing, but the armored bulldozer was impervious to their shots. Attempts to disable the bulldozer's cameras with gunfire failed as the bullets {{were unable to}} penetrate the 3-inch (7.6 cm) bullet-resistant plastic. At one point during the rampage, Undersheriff Glenn Trainor managed to climb atop the bulldozer and rode the bulldozer [...] "like a bronc-buster, {{trying to figure out}} a way to get a bullet inside the dragon". However, he was eventually forced to jump off to avoid being hit with debris.|$|E
5000|$|Boyd {{eventually}} said {{he would}} depart, picked up some of his possessions, {{and took a step}} downhill. An officer said [...] "Bang him." [...] Sandy threw a <b>flash-bang</b> device at Boyd, and Rick Ingram, the acting ROP sergeant at the site, fired his Taser shotgun, but it did not have any noticeable effect on Boyd. At the same time Weimerskirch sent the dog to bite him, then ran to the dog when it attacked the blue bag rather than Boyd. Startled, Boyd produced the knives again. Perez and Boyd testified that they felt he posed an imminent threat to Weimerskirch. Sandy said he moved closer to cover the dog and its handler. As officers approached, Boyd turned a quarter turn to his left and was shot.|$|E
50|$|On October 25, 2011, Scott Olsen, a 24-year-old Iraq War veteran {{suffered}} a skull fracture {{caused by a}} projectile that witnesses believed was a tear gas or smoke canister fired by the police.A video by protesters shows the explosion of {{what appears to be}} a <b>flash-bang</b> device thrown by one officer near protesters attempting to aid Olsen. The Associated Press later reported that it was not known exactly what kind of object had struck Olsen or who had thrown or fired it, but that protesters had been throwing rocks and bottles.Olsen was rushed to the hospital by other protesters, who were fired upon with unknown police projectiles while attempting to aid him. Doctors said that he was in critical condition. Scott Olsen has since undergone brain surgery. At least two other protesters were injured. No officers have been disciplined over the incident.|$|E

5000|$|Smoke screen: In urban {{settings}} or other environments with limited movement and fields of view, smoke {{can be an}} effective means to screen friendly movement. This can be used either to pass through and escape, or to close in on and eliminate the enemy sniper. Ordinary soldiers can still do damage through smoke by firing randomly or on intuition, but snipers lose their precision advantage and are far less likely to hit anything with their much lower possible shot volume. A determined enemy, such as an emplaced heavy machine gun, will fire randomly through smoke, so this is a dangerous tactic. It {{should also be noted that}} weapons of opportunity may also provide a smoke screen, anything from igniting a car's gas tank, oil drum, or using fragmentation grenades to throw up debris and quickly break line of sight and concentration. <b>Flash-bang</b> (distraction) grenades have a wider blast radius than fragmentation grenades.|$|E
5000|$|The sun had set by 7:15, and Boyd {{was still}} not giving into police demands. At 7:24 p.m., police {{officers}} Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez, K-9 officer Scott Weimerskirch, and a police dog approached Boyd's location. Boyd saw them coming, and gathered some of his belongings as if preparing to voluntarily depart. There {{appeared to be a}} chance he’d cooperate, according to video released by APD. He said [...] "All right, don’t change up the agreement. I’m going to try to walk with you." [...] Boyd picked up his knapsack and slung it over his shoulder, then picked up a blue nylon bag full of other belongings. Boyd's hands were empty. He put on his backpack, reached down to pick up a thermos, put it in his right hand and grabbed a blue... bag in his left hand. Just as he took his first step to walk down, Sandy threw a <b>flash-bang</b> grenade.|$|E
5000|$|Search {{and rescue}} {{training}} is effected with live ammunition. Operatives themselves simulate the hostage. Many special halls and rooms are built to conduct {{this type of}} training, and are known as [...] "SAS Rooms" [...] by the unit. In addition, [...] "Good faith shooting" [...] is practised, which consists of the operatives standing in line facing one another and shooting at targets placed between them. The bulletproof Kevlar vest and helmet {{are the same as}} those used by the German GSG-9. They are quite heavy, but they can stop a [...]30-06 projectile. All types of <b>flash-bang,</b> tear gas and non-lethal ammunition are in the unit's arsenal. British Avalon anti-gas masks, fireproof clothing (the same as used by the Italian GIS, and NOCS), kneepads, fireproof and tear-proof gloves are also used. Most of the personal equipment is of US origins, but a few Italian types are also in use, such as Vega and Radar.|$|E
50|$|On January 12, 2015, two Albuquerque PD officers, Keith Sandy and Dominique Perez, {{were charged}} with open counts {{of murder in the}} {{shooting}} death of James Boyd, a mentally ill homeless man who was illegally camping on the Sandia Mountains foothills on March 16, 2014. Boyd was carrying two camping knives in his hands and was shot three times, in the back and both arms, from at least ten feet away with a semi-automatic rifle after a five-hour standoff. Officers also fired a Taser shotgun and a beanbag shotgun at Boyd, while another officers threw a <b>flash-bang</b> grenade. The video also shows one officer unleashing his K-9 German shepherd against Boyd as he lay on the ground wheezing. The standoff was captured on body mounted cameras. Boyd died later at UNM Hospital. In the final hours of his life, Boyd had his right arm amputated and his spleen, a section of his lung and a length of his intestines removed. The death of Boyd led to many protests in Albuquerque claiming excessive force. The APD was also sued by Boyd's brother, alleging wrongful death. In July 2015, the city of Albuquerque agreed to pay $5 million to Boyd's family.|$|E
40|$|Diversionary {{devices such}} as flashbang grenades are used {{in a wide variety}} of {{military}} and law-enforcement operations. They function to distract and/or incapacitate adversaries in scenarios ranging from hostage rescue to covert strategic paralysis operations. There are a number of disadvantages associated with currently available diversionary devices. Serious injuries and fatalities have resulted from their use both operationally and in training. Because safety is of paramount importance, desired improvements to these devices include protection against inadvertent initiation, the elimination of the production of high-velocity fragments, less damaging decibel output and increased light output. Sandia National Laboratories has developed a next-generation diversionary <b>flash-bang</b> device that will provide the end user with these enhanced safety features...|$|E
