As a result, Dallas Fort Worth International Airport’s (DFW) Operations (OPS) Division {{is interested in}} estimating the anticipated departing <b>flight</b> <b>cancellations</b> to efficiently, and safely mitigate the negative effects caused. Accurately estimating the anticipated number of departing <b>flight</b> <b>cancellations</b> well in advance can assist airport operators to plan efficiently, and safely execute flight operations with minimal impact on passenger movement, airport capacity and throughput; consequently minimizing or completely reducing the chances of irregular operations (IROPS). This study focuses on weather related departure <b>flight</b> <b>cancellations.</b> Operations and weather data associated {{with at least one}} departure cancellation from 2010 to 2015 are used for mathematical modelling, analysis and validation. The Empirical Bayes (EB) model is used to evaluate the various weather factors that significantly affect flight departure operations. Using Pearson matrix correlation, five weather factors, each with 1047 observations, (6282 entities) are determined and used in the model. The use of EB model accounts for the regression-to-mean (RTM) phenomena not accounted for by the negative binomial (NB) distributions used in the evaluation process. Both qualitative and quantitative statistical validation approaches are used to justify the results found. Actual departure cancellation DFW data from 2016 is used against the estimated results for validation. Results indicate that the number of weather related departure <b>flight</b> <b>cancellations</b> increases when the dew point temperature, the visibility distance and the cloud ceiling height decrease. Results, however, indicate that the number of weather related departure <b>flight</b> <b>cancellations</b> increases with increasing precipitation and cloud cover index.

50|$|It is {{possible}} to piece together a round-the-world route by combining one-way tickets on various airlines without resorting to alliances. In addition, discounts often apply to some long- and short-haul legs. It can be useful to consult with travel agents who specialize in round-the-world itineraries to compare fares and itineraries. These {{can be found in}} major cities that are transit hubs — San Francisco, London, New York, Bangkok, etc. — and many of them also provide services online. The overall booking process can vary from a few days to weeks based upon itinerary, budget, and other considerations. Travel agents may get parts of tickets issued by contacts in other countries, and often use pre-arranged contractual agreements with various airlines. Low-cost carriers often only have tickets which do not include other airlines. It is important to have long waiting time between such flights, preferably a hotel night, which gives the chance to see one more city. Otherwise a <b>flight</b> <b>cancellation</b> might destroy the entire itinerary.|$|E
50|$|AirHelp is a {{technology}} company that provides legal services to airline passengers {{who have experienced}} a <b>flight</b> <b>cancellation,</b> delay or overbooking when traveling into {{or out of the}} European Union. Under EU Regulation 261/2004, airline passengers could be entitled to compensation if their flight was disrupted while departing from or arriving to an EU member state with an EU-registered airline.The company's services are meant to educate and empower travelers to make full use of their consumer rights, and in turn, raise the level of customer care provided by airlines. The legislation does not apply to flights that were disrupted by extraordinary circumstances beyond the airline's control such as weather-related reasons or airport strikes. However, the law's jurisdiction includes flights dating back as far as five years.Airline passengers can use the AirHelp website or smartphone app to check their flight eligibility at no cost. After determining eligibility, the passenger can choose to enlist AirHelp to handle their claim against the airline. Compensation amounts and eligibility are determined by numerous factors including flight origin and destination, flight distance and the number of total hours delayed before arriving at its final destination. The company is compensated by a contingent fee based on the final compensation payout.AirHelp seeks to simplify the claims process on behalf of airline passengers who may not otherwise seek recourse for disrupted travel, of which there are many. The Manchester Evening News reported that travelers through Manchester Airport were entitled to tens of millions of pounds that are so far unclaimed.The service is available in the United States, Denmark, Sweden, Norway, Finland, UK/Ireland, France/Belgium, the Netherlands, Germany/Switzerland/Austria, Spain, Italy, Portugal, Greece, and claims to have helped more than 2,000,000 passengers in 35 countries.|$|E

40|$|Demand for {{air travel}} has {{increased}} {{over the years and}} so have airport delays and congestion. Delays have a huge impact on airline costs and influence the satisfaction of passengers, thus becoming an important topic of research in the field of air transportation. In recent literature, a Passenger Delay Calculator (PDC) was proposed to estimate passenger delays. The PDC computes passenger delays for a specified day based on actual flight schedules, fight cancellation information, and ticket booking information. However, since actual fight schedules are a necessary input, the PDC cannot be applied directly to hypothetical scenarios, in which different cancellation strategies are implemented and their impact on passenger delays are evaluated. A different model. Airport Network Delays (AND), has also been developed recently. The AND model estimates fight delays and relies on an input in which demand consists of the national planned fight schedule for any given day. In this thesis, we have attempted to incorporate these two models, the AND and the PDC, within a single framework, so that the resulting new integrated model can compute passenger delays without requiring an actual flight-schedule input. The integrated model would certainly increase the usefulness and applicability of the PDC since it could be used with hypothetical scenarios, different <b>flight</b> <b>cancellation</b> strategies, etc. We first describe the framework of the integrated model for studying flight delays and passenger delays at a daily scale. The integrated model includes four components: a Tail Recovery Model, <b>Flight</b> <b>Cancellation</b> Algorithms, a Refined Airport Network Delay (RAND) model, and the PDC. The Tail Recovery Model recovers missing tail numbers for many flights recorded in the Aviation System Performance Metrics (ASPM) database. The <b>Flight</b> <b>Cancellation</b> Algorithms implement alternative strategies for flight cancellations in the presence of large delays, such as cancelling flights with long flight delays or flights with a large ratio of flight delay divided by the seating capacity of the aircraft. The RAND model is an extension of the AND, in which two implicit assumptions of the AND model have been modified. The RAND model produces better estimates of flight delays in the sense of replicating actual flight delays obtained from the ASPM database. The overall integrated model is able to compute passenger delays and relies only on planned flight schedules rather than actual flight schedules. Moreover, the integrated model facilitates the study of factors that influence flight delays, such as weather conditions and demand fluctuations, and evaluates the impact of different cancellation strategies on passenger delays. Using actual data from different days, we conclude that passenger delays can be reduced on the busiest traffic days through improved <b>flight</b> <b>cancellation</b> strategies. In {{the second part of the}} thesis, we extend the RAND model to compute flight delays on a monthly scale using different capacity profiles as input. These capacity profiles can be directly obtained from Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) reports or constructed by using classical machine learning algorithms on airport-level data. We validate our estimation of flight delays by using data of January, 2008, showing that both the capacity profiles and the RAND perform well in terms of replicating the actual monthly flight delays. These results imply that an effort can be made to develop an integrated model incorporating the RAND, the PDC etc. at a monthly scale or even at any generic time scale. by He Sun. Thesis: S.

40|$|Customer Flow Management (CFM) {{systems are}} used to manage queues and support {{customer}} service business processes at various companies. The customer experience could be improved and waiting time reduced, if the service provisioning adapts to the context.

To support model-driven implementation of adaptive workflows, the BPMN meta-model is extended to represent adaptive features and to support reuse of workflow activities across multiple alternative implementations of workflow execution variants. To illustrate the approach, a prototype of the dynamic luggage registration and online ticket re-registration in case of <b>flight</b> <b>cancellation</b> CFM system is developed...|$|E

40|$|Critical {{paths in}} a metapopulation model of H 1 N 1 : Efficiently delaying {{influenza}} spreading through <b>flight</b> <b>cancellation</b> Disease spreading through human travel networks {{has been a}} topic of great interest in recent years, as witnessed during outbreaks of influenza A (H 1 N 1) or SARS pandemics. One way to stop spreading over the airline network are travel restrictions for major airports or network hubs based on {{the total number of}} passengers of an airport. Here, we test alternative strategies using edge removal, cancelling targeted flight connections rather than restricting traffic for network hubs, for controlling spreading over the airline network. We employ a SEIR metapopulation model that takes into account the population of cities, simulates infection within cities and across the network of the top 500 airports, and tests different <b>flight</b> <b>cancellation</b> methods for limiting the course of infection. The time required to spread an infection globally, as simulated by a stochastic global spreading model was used to rank the candidate control strategies. The model includes both local spreading dynamics at the level of populations and long-range connectivity obtained from real global airline travel data. Simulated spreading in this network showed that spreading infected 37 % less individuals after cancelling a quarter of flight connections between cities, as selected by betweenness centrality. The alternative strategy of closing down whole airports causing the same number of cancelled connections only reduced infections by 18 %. In conclusion, selecting highly ranked single connections between cities for cancellation was more effective, resulting in fewer individuals infected with influenza, compared to shutting down whole airports. It is also a more efficient strategy, affecting fewer passengers while producing the same reduction in infections...|$|E

Despite {{the existing literature}} on contentious forms of labor disputes, {{little is known about}} the relationship between less pronounced expressions of labor turmoil and product/service quality. To investigate how various forms of labor turmoil affect service quality, this thesis conducted an intra-industry event study to analyze unique carrier-craft-monthly data on the major U. S. domestic airlines between 1987 and 2008. This thesis contributes to the literature in two aspects. First, this thesis analyzed diverse forms of labor turmoil from both routine and disrupted industrial relations actions in the important areas of business strategy, employee representation, and collective bargaining. Second, exploiting detailed monthly measures of operational performance and passenger service, this thesis examined the relative contribution of each occupation's labor turmoil to service quality. The empirical results strongly suggest that diverse forms of labor turmoil affect service quality in the airline industry. First, while strategic turmoil arising from the mergers and acquisitions generally had a significant effect on operational performance, representation and bargaining turmoil had significant effects on both operational performance and passenger service. Second, the significant effects on passenger service were obtained even after the correlations between operational performance and passenger service were accounted for. Third, representation turmoil from conflicts between employer and employees was more influential for affecting service quality than labor turmoil from conflicts among employees. Fourth, the legal framework governing the bargaining process under the RLA was also important for service quality. In particular, the mediation/arbitration process is less visible than strikes, but its cumulative effects on <b>flight</b> <b>cancellation</b> from 1987 - 2008 were found to be well beyond the cumulative effects of strikes on <b>flight</b> <b>cancellation.</b> Another unique finding is that the effect of labor turmoil on service quality has weakened in the post- 9 / 11 period, particularly for representation and bargaining turmoil. Finally, this thesis shows how labor turmoil within particular occupations differentially affects service quality. Taken together, this thesis suggests a need to broaden the conceptualization of labor dispute in the industrial relations literature and to expand what it considers to be the set of determinants of economic performance...|$|E
