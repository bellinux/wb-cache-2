60|$|Billy {{threw himself}} upon {{his stomach and}} crawled slowly <b>forward</b> <b>stopping</b> often. The sentry seemed asleep. He did not move. Billy reached the shadow {{at the side of}} the {{structure}} and some fifty feet from the soldier without detection. Then he rose to his feet directly beneath a barred window.|$|E
60|$|It was a fearsome walk, and {{one which}} will be with me so long as memory holds. In the great {{moonlight}} clearings I slunk along among the shadows on the margin. In the jungle I crept <b>forward,</b> <b>stopping</b> with a beating heart whenever I heard, as I often did, the crash of breaking branches as some wild beast went past. Now and then great shadows loomed up for an instant and were gone--great, silent shadows which seemed to prowl upon padded feet. How often I stopped {{with the intention of}} returning, and yet every time my pride conquered my fear, and sent me on again until my object should be attained.|$|E
60|$|For {{half a mile}} he closely {{followed}} the Delaware's plainly marked trail. Then he stopped {{to take a quick}} survey of the forest before him. He abruptly left the trail, and, breaking into a run, went through the woods as fleetly and noiselessly as a deer, running for a quarter of a mile, when he stopped to listen. All seemed well, for he lowered his head, and walked slowly along, examining the moss and leaves. Presently he came upon a little open space where the soil was a sandy loam. He bent over, then rose quickly. He had come upon the Indian's trail. Cautiously he moved <b>forward,</b> <b>stopping</b> every moment to listen. In all the close pursuits of his maturer years he had never been a victim of that most cunning of Indian tricks, an ambush. He relied solely on his ear to learn if foes were close by. The wild creatures of the forest were his informants. As soon as he heard any change in their twittering, humming or playing--whichever way they manifested their joy or fear of life--he became as hard to see, as difficult to hear as a creeping snake.|$|E
60|$|He started <b>forward,</b> <b>stopped,</b> {{trembling}} {{with a shock}} of remembrance, and gave back again.|$|R
60|$|She {{turned away}} as Ford drew back coldly {{and let her}} hand fall from his arm. She {{took a few steps}} <b>forward,</b> <b>stopped,</b> ran back to him again, crushed his face and head in a close embrace, and then seemed to dip like a bird into the tall bracken, and was gone.|$|R
60|$|The Alcalde {{took a step}} <b>forward.</b> She <b>stopped</b> him by a quick gesture.|$|R
60|$|He {{wanted to}} run away, but when he moved it was to slide about painfully and slowly upon that earth which had become mud so {{suddenly}} under his feet. He fought {{his way up the}} courtyard like a man pushing through a crowd, his head down, one shoulder <b>forward,</b> <b>stopping</b> often, and sometimes carried back a pace or two in the rush of water which his heart was not stout enough to face. Aissa followed him step by step, stopping when he stopped, recoiling with him, moving forward with him in his toilsome way up the slippery declivity of the courtyard, of that courtyard, from which everything seemed to have been swept away by the first rush of the mighty downpour. They could see nothing. The tree, the bushes, the house, and the fences--all had disappeared in the thickness of the falling rain. Their hair stuck, streaming, to their heads; their clothing clung to them, beaten close to their bodies; water ran off them, off their heads over their shoulders. They moved, patient, upright, slow and dark, in the gleam clear or fiery of the falling drops, under the roll of unceasing thunder, like two wandering ghosts of the drowned that, condemned to haunt the water for ever, had come up from the river to look at the world under a deluge.|$|E
5000|$|Patrol boats (Yu ting) {{are small}} vessels used for {{collecting}} intelligence. They have no ramparts above the hull, but to {{port and starboard}} there is one rowlock every four feet, varying in total number according {{to the size of}} the boat. Whether going <b>forward,</b> <b>stopping,</b> or returning, or making evolutions in formation, the speed (of these boats) is like flying. But they are for reconnaissance, they are not fighting boats/ships [...]|$|E
50|$|The largest (and type) species, A. mortoni was a cow-sized predator. Rhino {{jaws and}} other mammal bones {{have been found}} with bite marks on them that match the large canines of A. mortoni. A fossil {{trackway}} in Toadstool Geologic Park depicts {{the path of a}} Subhyracodon walking <b>forward,</b> <b>stopping</b> to see an Archaeotherium approach, then breaking into a gallop with the entelodont chasing after it. In leaner times, it is suggested that Archaeotherium dug for roots and tubers, as with other pig-like mammals.|$|E

60|$|Lord Lumley sprang <b>forward</b> to <b>stop</b> her; but {{his mother}} {{was the first to}} recover herself.|$|R
5000|$|The M1917 had {{previously}} been used with half-moon clips that held three rounds of the rimless [...]45ACP. If half-moon or moon clips are not used with a rimless cartridge in a revolver, they must be ejected by hand with a rod or field-expedient tool like a pencil. In revolver cylinders not engineered to allow [...]45ACP to headspace properly, as in early production Colt M1917s, the cartridges could slip <b>forward,</b> <b>stopping</b> them from firing. Adding the rim solved both these issues.|$|E
30|$|Regarding controlling, the DL {{students}} seemed {{better at}} controlling their learning process than their F 2 F peers. For example, Avi, an Industrial Engineering student, asserted: â€¦in online learning, I can control {{various aspects of}} learning, including the lecture videos, which I can fast <b>forward,</b> <b>stop,</b> or replay. Students from both groups thought that online environments are effective method for evaluation, indicating the importance of immediate feedback {{and the ability to}} monitor their grades.|$|R

40|$|This project {{deals with}} the usage of {{development}} kit Chronos ez 430 to demonstrate fundamental movements based on the recognition of gestures. Recognition of basic gestures for movements (<b>forward,</b> <b>stop,</b> backwards and turning) is the fundamental {{part of the work}} which is based on formulating algorithm. The formulating of algorithm for data processing runs under Matlab/Simulink. The algorithm is converted into the C language {{and with the help of}} Code Composer Studio is integrated into kit Chronos ez 430...|$|R
6000|$|No, Stubb; you may pound that knot {{there as}} much as you please, but you will never pound into me what you were just now saying. And how long ago is it since you said the very contrary? Didn't you once say that {{whatever}} ship Ahab sails in, that ship should pay something extra on its insurance policy, just as though it were loaded with powder barrels aft and boxes of lucifers <b>forward?</b> <b>Stop,</b> now; didn't you say so?" ...|$|R
60|$|Breckenridge laid a {{restraining}} hand upon his arm, but he shook it off, and moving <b>forward</b> <b>stopped</b> {{just outside the}} threshold. The lad could not see his face, but he noticed that he stood very straight, with his head thrown back a trifle, and that {{one or two of}} those without edged farther into the shadowy crowd. Glancing behind him, he also saw the cook leaning forward on the stairway with the rifle glinting in his hands.|$|R
60|$|She {{felt for}} one of the trees, and passed her hand {{carefully}} round its trunk. Then she took a few steps <b>forward</b> and <b>stopped</b> short.|$|R
5000|$|By default xombrero window {{contains}} two panels, providing the ordinary layout {{of a web}} browser window. The first one (on the top) - [...] "fancy bar" [...] - provides URL entry, backward, <b>forward,</b> <b>stop</b> and white-list toggle buttons and optional search string entry. Another panel (on the bottom) - [...] "status bar" [...] - reports the current URL (or page title), zoom level and position in page. With these panels enabled and a mouse attached, the user may operate xombrero like Firefox or Midori.|$|R
60|$|As {{he spoke}} we were {{passing through a}} little patch of thick bush. Suddenly from out of this bush, I saw a lad appear. He wore a mask upon his face, but from his shape {{could not have been}} more than {{thirteen}} or fourteen years of age. In his hand was a wooden club. He ran <b>forward,</b> <b>stopped,</b> and with a yell of hate hurled it, I think at Bastin, but it hit me. At any rate I felt a shock and remembered no more.|$|R
60|$|With {{these words}} Saul Mangle sprang <b>forward</b> to <b>stop</b> Allen, {{who was about}} to mount Jasper. He reached the young man's side as Allen gained the saddle.|$|R

40|$|Reviewed October 1, 1993. "Line {{driving is}} one of the most {{valuable}} techniques for training horses. It can be used to train horses too young to ride, to retrain spoiled horses, or to teach others new movements. Young horses can be taught to move <b>forward,</b> <b>stop,</b> back, stand, turn, and other preliminary obedience steps by line driving. If these maneuvers have been taught on the longe line, so much the better. They can be advanced to sharp turns. Horses also can be introduced to strange objects they might shy from under saddle...|$|R
60|$|Forgetting all precaution, {{he pressed}} eagerly <b>forward,</b> and <b>stopped</b> before the gate. There {{was no sound}} from within; there had evidently been no {{challenge}} nor interruption. She was safe.|$|R
60|$|Mr. Finch {{waved his}} hand {{with a look of}} disgust, intimating that Zillah's {{audience}} was over. Nugent, upon that, came <b>forward,</b> and <b>stopped</b> her as she was leaving the room.|$|R
60|$|He turned, laughing, to Mademoiselle. But {{she stood}} with her lips parted and her hands dropped, staring at my companion. Then she took two steps <b>forward</b> and <b>stopped</b> with a cry.|$|R
60|$|As {{though it}} heard his voice, the car leaped <b>forward</b> and <b>stopped</b> {{with a sudden}} and most {{formidable}} jerk; the door burst open, and Mr. Lavender fell out upon his sheep-dog.|$|R
60|$|A sea {{rolled up}} astern and buried the poop. Kit felt the steamer lift and turn, {{as if on}} a pivot at the middle of her length. The after-deck was full of water, but the bows were high and going round, and he was {{conscious}} of a curious shiver that ran through the straining hull as she shook herself free from the sand. She crawled <b>forward,</b> <b>stopped,</b> and moved again with a staggering lurch. The next sea swept her on, but she did not strike, and after a few moments Kit knew she had crossed the top of the shoal.|$|R
60|$|Thus appealed to, {{she came}} <b>forward</b> and <b>stopped,</b> still {{standing}} {{off a little}} way, but near enough to see, gazing at the shining copper caps on the cylinders, at the bright rods and gears.|$|R
50|$|A {{number of}} {{features}} make this intersection safer. A corner refuge island, a setback {{crossing of the}} pedestrians and cyclists, generally between 1.5-7 metres of setback, a <b>forward</b> <b>stop</b> bar, which allows cyclists to stop for a traffic light well ahead of motor traffic who must stop behind the crosswalk. Separate signal staging or at least an advance green for cyclists and pedestrians is used to give cyclists and pedestrians no conflicts or a head start over traffic. The design makes a right turn on red, and sometimes left on red depending on the geometry of the intersection in question, possible in many cases, often without stopping.|$|R
60|$|Two little fires burned brightly on the water's edge on {{each side}} of the landing place. A small heap of damar-gum torches lay by each, and between them Babalatchi strolled {{backwards}} and <b>forwards,</b> <b>stopping</b> often with his face to the river and his head on one side, listening to the sounds that came from the darkness over the water. There was no moon and the night was very clear overhead, but, after the afternoon breeze had expired in fitful puffs, the vapours hung thickening over the glancing surface of the Pantai and clung to the shore, hiding from view the middle of the stream.|$|R
60|$|BOHUN (pouncing <b>forward</b> again). <b>Stop.</b> You're {{going to}} tell me about your feelings, Mr. Crampton. Don't: I sympathize with them; but they're not my business. Tell us exactly what you want: that's what we have to get at.|$|R
40|$|Abstract. During bipedal gait, a robot {{falls from}} one foot to the other. This mo-tion can be {{approximated}} with that of an inverted pendulum with discrete movements of the contact point. We detail here how to use the linear inverted pendulum model (LIPM) for selecting successive contact points in such a way that the centre of mass (COM) of the robot flexibly follows a predefined set of waypoints on a straight or curved trajectory, allowing it to move <b>forward,</b> <b>stop</b> and revert its direction of motion in stable way. The use of a fixed step cycle duration reduces the mathematical complexity and the computational load, ena-bling real-time updating of gait parameters in a microcontroller. ...|$|R
