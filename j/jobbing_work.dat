50|$|Clarke {{was born}} in Maryport, Cumberland, {{and went to work}} for a Mr. Huntley, a chemist and druggist, in Gateshead. His early journalism brought him support from William Burdon, and a sizarship at Emmanuel College, Cambridge. He left Cambridge without a degree, and went to London, where he edited The Scourge, a monthly publication, contributed to The Satirist, and engaged in <b>jobbing</b> {{literary}} <b>work.</b>|$|R

50|$|CNC {{machines}} are becoming the standard {{due to their}} speed, precision, flexibility, and reduced downtime while changing jobs.

60|$|Nevertheless, because {{human nature}} always craves and half creates the things {{necessary}} to its happiness, there are approximations and suggestions {{of the possibility}} of such a race even here. The nearest approach I know to the temper of a Peasant in England is that of the country gardener; not, of course, the great scientific gardener attached to the great houses; he is a rich man's servant like any other. I mean the small <b>jobbing</b> gardener who <b>works</b> for two or three moderate-sized gardens; who works on his own; who sometimes even owns his house; and who frequently owns his tools. This kind of man has really some of the characteristics of the true Peasant&mdash;especially the characteristics that people don't like. He has none of that irresponsible mirth which is the consolation of most poor men in England. The gardener is even disliked sometimes by the owners of the shrubs and flowers; because (like Micaiah) he prophesies not good concerning them, but evil. The English gardener is grim, critical, self-respecting; sometimes even economical. Nor is this (as the reader's lightning wit will flash back at me) merely because the English gardener is always a Scotch gardener. The type does exist in pure South England blood and speech; I have spoken to the type. I was speaking to the type only the other evening, when a rather odd little incident occurred.|$|R

50|$|Henry Boot (1851-1931) {{was born}} a farmer’s son in the small village of Heeley just outside Sheffield. Henry served a seven-year {{apprenticeship}} and worked a total of 20 years with local building firms before he began {{to work on his}} own account in 1886. The new business rapidly progressed from <b>jobbing</b> <b>work</b> to larger scale public contracts and housing projects. Henry’s eldest son Charles Boot (1874-1945) joined the business after leaving school (presumably not long after the business started) and it was he who transformed Henry Boot & Sons {{into one of the most}} successful construction and housing businesses between the wars.|$|E
5000|$|Ebenezer {{was born}} in the late 19th century, and dies in the early 1960s. He lived his whole life in Vale. He never married, despite a few flings with local girls, and a tempestuous {{relationship}} with Liza Queripel of Pleinmont. He left the island only once, to travel to Jersey to watch the Muratti. For most of his life he was a grower and fisherman, although he also served in the North regiment of the Royal Guernsey Militia (though not outside the island) and did some <b>jobbing</b> <b>work</b> for the States of Guernsey {{in the latter part of}} his life.|$|E
5000|$|The Albion {{press is}} a model of early iron hand {{printing}} press, originally designed and manufactured in London by Richard Whittaker Cope (d. 1828?) around 1820. It worked by a simple toggle action, unlike the complex lever-mechanism of the Columbian press and the Stanhope press. Albions continued to be manufactured, in a range of sizes, until the 1930s. They were used for commercial book-printing until {{the middle of the nineteenth}} century, and thereafter chiefly for proofing, <b>jobbing</b> <b>work</b> and by private presses. Francis Meynell often used an Albion to take proof impressions of his designs for Nonesuch Press books, and printed some small books and ephemera using the press.|$|E
5000|$|Clement {{made his}} first planer in 1820 …. Some years later he built his [...] "great planer," [...] a {{remarkable}} machine from both a mechanical and a financial standpoint. A very full description of it was given by Mr. Varley in the [...] "Transactions of the Society of Arts" [...] in London in 1832, illustrated {{by a set of}} copper plates made from Clement's own drawings. Clement's reputation of being the most expert draftsman of his day is well borne out by these drawings. … It was fitted with centers and was used for planing circular, spiral and conical work as well as flat work. It took in work 6 feet square and was hand-driven. … For more than ten years it {{was the only one of}} its size and it ran for many years night and day on <b>jobbing</b> <b>work,</b> its earnings forming Clement's principal income.|$|E

Guernsey is a microcosm of the world as Dublin is to James Joyce and Dorset is to Hardy. After a life fraught with difficulties and full of moving episodes, Ebenezer is ready to die happy, bequeathing his pot of gold and autobiography (The Book of Ebenezer Le Page) to the young artist he befriends, after an incident in which the latter smashed his greenhouse.|$|E
5000|$|The {{firm was}} a {{well-established}} printing {{house by the}} time Arthur's son sold Arthur King and Co. in 1872. The firm [...] "did much <b>jobbing</b> <b>work,</b> and for many years had printed the Aberdeen Free Press and produced a great many papers, announcements and notices relating {{to the expansion of}} the railway system into the North and North-East of Scotland." [...] The new owners were: John Thomson, former compositor and later foreman in the case room of the Aberdeen Journal, Alexander Troup, a wholesale bookseller and stationer, and a Mr. Mackenzie. Over the next fifteen years, Thomson bought out his partners, becoming sole owner of the profitable enterprise. Arthur King and Co. grew at strong clip throughout the period; the number of employees increased from 21 in 1872, to 66 in 1887, to 118 by 1894. The firm was sufficiently competitive to undertake work for metropolitan publishers, despite the distance from Aberdeen to the centers of the British publishing world: Glasgow, Edinburgh, and London.|$|E
50|$|Much of Pershore Road from Cotteridge to Pebble Mill {{is lined}} with {{artisans}} houses built from the 1870s. Many of the side roads have similar houses {{and there are also}} unique terraces, Derwent Cottages, and Rose Cottages that lie behind the Pershore Road. The main builders were Grant’s Estates and they often gave the terraces names and the date of construction. Grant’s Estates was founded by brothers Thomas James Grant and Henry Michael Grant in the 1890s. Groups of terraced housing in Cotteridge and King’s Heath, stable blocks, and other <b>jobbing</b> <b>work</b> in 1897 {{can be traced to the}} company. They concentrated on buying building plots on green field sites, laying out the roads and drainage, and letting the properties. Their business premises were next to the railway bridge in Cotteridge. Sewell’s acquired the business in 1961. The family lived in a house called Falcon Hill which became a police station in the 1960s and was replaced by Grant’s Court ten years later. The family name is preserved in the Grant Arms pub. Mrs Ellen Grant Ferris bought Harvington Hall, in 1920, which she gave to the Roman Catholic Archdiocese of Birmingham. The houses on the East side of the Pershore Road from Ten Acres heading towards Pebble Mill are known as the ABC houses as they are named in alphabetical order after places in Britain. The ambitious project only got as far as J for Jarrow.|$|E
40|$|Contract research, {{which is}} a {{commercial}} research service undertaken for commissioning clients, may be seen to amount {{to little more than}} <b>jobbing</b> <b>work.</b> This paper considers case studies undertaken by my own university unit in light of various theoretical positions about research as a knowledge building activity, paying particular attention to the notions of innovation characterised in patent regulations. The review suggests that design research into a single area, such as our case study of rotationally moulded products, typically involves the skills of project management, with a greater requirement for broad knowledge of a number of research methodologies, rather than just one that is especial to design research. These reflections may suggest that a shared understanding of design research is as well assisted by retrospective examination of practice, as by prospective theoretical debate...|$|E
