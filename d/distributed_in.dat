40|$|This article, {{in which}} the theory {{structural}} phonology was used, discusses the phonological and lexical description of Modebur language, {{one of the local}} languages in Pantar Island. The result of analysis shows that the Modebur language has five vowels; they are /i/, /e/, /a/, /o/, and /u/. They all can <b>distribute</b> <b>in</b> the initial, medial and final position of words. It has sixteen phonemes and sixteen consonants, many of which can <b>distribute</b> <b>in</b> the beginning of words, some can <b>distribute</b> <b>in</b> the initial and medial position of words only, and one can only <b>distribute</b> <b>in</b> the final position of words. The consonants which can distribute completely are /p/, /b/, /m/, /t/, /n/, /s/, /l/, /k/, /?/, /g/, and the ones which can <b>distribute</b> <b>in</b> the initial and medial position of words are /j/, /h/, /w/, and the one which can <b>distribute</b> <b>in</b> the final position of words is /?/.  </p...|$|R

5|$|A toxin-antitoxin {{system is}} a set of two or more closely linked genes that {{together}} encode both a protein 'poison' and a corresponding 'antidote'. When these systems are contained on plasmids– transferable genetic elements– they ensure that only the daughter cells that inherit the plasmid survive after cell division. If the plasmid is absent in a daughter cell, the unstable antitoxin is degraded and the stable toxic protein kills the new cell; this is known as 'post-segregational killing' (PSK). Toxin-antitoxin systems are widely <b>distributed</b> <b>in</b> prokaryotes, and organisms often have them in multiple copies.|$|E
5|$|A. macrodactylum is {{a member}} of the Ambystomatidae, also known as the mole salamanders.

The Ambystomatidae are also members of suborder Salamandroidea, which includes all the salamanders capable of internal fertilization. The sister species to A.macrodactylum is A. laterale, <b>distributed</b> <b>in</b> eastern North America. However, the species-level phylogeny for Ambystomatidae is tentative and in need of further testing.|$|E
