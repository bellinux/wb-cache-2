40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfillment}} of the requirements for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. An experimental investigation {{has been carried out}} to determine the aerodynamic performance of an annular S-shaped duct representative of that used to connect the compressor spools of aircraft gas turbine engines. Measurements of both the mean flow and turbulent structure have been obtained using both 5 hole pressure probes and a 3 component Laser Doppler Anemometry (LDA) system. The measurements indicate that development of the flow within the duct is complex and significantly influenced by the combined effects of streamwise pressure gradients and flow curvature. For inlet conditions in which boundary layers are developed along an upstream entry length the static pressure, shear stress and velocity distributions are presented. The data shows {{that as a result of}} flow curvature significant streamwise pressure gradients exist within the duct, with this curvature also affecting the generation and suppression of turbulence. The stagnation pressure loss within the duct is also assessed and is consistent with the measured distributions of shear stress. More engine representative conditions are provided by locating a single stage compressor at inlet to the duct. Relative to the naturally developed inlet conditions the flow within the duct is less likely to separate, but mixing out of the compressor blade wakes increases the measured duct loss. With both types of inlet conditions the effect of a <b>radial</b> <b>strut,</b> such as that used for carrying loads and engine services, is also described both in terms of the static pressure distribution along the strut and its contribution to overall loss. The effects of inlet swirl on the flow field that develops within an annular S-shaped duct have also been investigated. By removing the outlet guide vanes from an upstream single stage compressor swirl angles in excess of 30 ° were generated. Results show that within the S-shaped duct tangential momentum is conserved, leading to increasing swirl velocities through the duct as its radius decreases. Furthermore, this component influences the streamwise velocity as pressure gradients are established to ensure the mean flow follows the duct curvature. Consequently in the critical region adjacent to the inner casing, where separation is most likely to occur, higher streamwise velocities are observed. Within the duct substantial changes also occur to the turbulence field which results in an increased stagnation pressure loss between duct inlet and exit. Data is also presented showing the increasing swirl angles through the duct which has consequences both for the design of the downstream compressor spool and of any <b>radial</b> <b>struts</b> which may be located within the duct...|$|R

The fundamental structural and functional unit of the aortic wall is the medial lamellar unit (MLU). While the basic composition and organization of the MLU is known, three-dimensional (3 D) microstructural details are tenuous, due (in part) to lack of three-dimensional data at micro- and nano-scales. We applied novel electron and confocal microscopy techniques to obtain 3 D volumetric information of aortic medial microstructure at micro- and nano-scales with all constituents present. For the rat abdominal aorta, we show that medial elastin has three primary forms: with approximately 71 % of total elastin as thick, continuous lamellar sheets, 27 % as thin, protruding interlamellar elastin fibers (IEFs), and 2 % as thick <b>radial</b> <b>struts.</b> Elastin pores are not simply holes in lamellar sheets, but are indented and gusseted openings in lamellae.

Collagen fibers are organized as large, parallel bundles tightly enveloping SMC nuclei. Quantification of the orientation of collagen bundles, SMC nuclei, and IEFs reveal that all three primary medial constituents have predominantly circumferential orientation, correlating with reported circumferentially dominant values of physiological stress, collagen fiber recruitment, and tissue stiffness.

40|$|A {{doctoral}} thesis submitted in partial fulfilment {{of the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy. Diffusers are essential in gas turbine combustors, decelerating the compressor efflux prior to the combustion chamber to reduce total pressure losses. Modern, low emission, radially staged combustors require even more diffusion due to the increased flame tube depth {{of this type of}} combustor. Furthermore, these high rates of deceleration are accompanied by large adverse pressure gradients and an associated risk of flow separation. Previous studies have shown that hybrid diffusers can achieve high rates of efficient diffusion in far shorter lengths than conventional faired diffusers or dump diffuser systems, representing a potential performance gain and weight saving. Hybrid diffusers consist of a wide angle diffuser immediately downstream of a sudden expansion, with flow separation prevented by bleeding off a small amount of the mainstream flow. However, previous studies have not provided a conclusive understanding of the associated flow mechanisms leading to hybrid diffusers currently being considered high risk. Additionally definitive data does not exist on the influence of bleed gap geometry and therefore hybrid diffusers cannot, currently, be optimised for use in a modern gas turbine. Further issues also not addressed by earlier studies, but concerning the use of hybrid diffuser in gas turbine combustors, are the effect of representative inlet conditions incorporating vane wakes at diffuser inlet, the quality of the bleed air and its potential for use for component cooling, the effect of <b>radial</b> <b>struts</b> within a hybrid diffuser {{and the quality of the}} flow delivered to the combustor feed annuli (total pressure losses). Therefore, a predominately experimental study, coupled with CFD predictions, was undertaken to investigate the controlling flow mechanisms of hybrid diffusers and address the questions necessary to evaluate the suitability of hybrid diffusers for use in modern, low emission, radially staged combustion systems. An existing isothermal test facility was used comprising a fully annular, staged combustor downstream of a single stage axial compressor incorporating engine representative outlet guide vanes. Initial experimental work led to rig modifications which allowed a range of hybrid diffusers to be studied.
