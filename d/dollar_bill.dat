5|$|In the United States {{green was}} {{connected}} with the <b>dollar</b> <b>bill.</b> Since 1861, the reverse side of the <b>dollar</b> <b>bill</b> has been green. Green was originally chosen because it deterred counterfeiters, who tried to use early camera equipment to duplicate banknotes. Also, since the banknotes were thin, the green on the back did not show through and muddle {{the pictures on the}} front of the banknote. Green continues to be used because the public now associates it with a strong and stable currency.|$|E
5|$|Ten <b>Dollar</b> <b>Bill</b> (also {{referred}} to as The <b>Dollar</b> <b>Bill)</b> is a 1956 proto-pop art lithographic drawing by Roy Lichtenstein. Considered to {{be a combination of}} Americana art and cubism, the work is {{referred to}} as the beginning to Lichtenstein's work on pop art. Twenty-five editions of the lithograph were made by Lichtenstein, which were exhibited at several galleries. The piece is based on the design for the ten-dollar bill and has influenced several of Lichtenstein's later works. The picture has received generally favorable reception from critics, and is considered to be one of the best artistic portrayals of currency.|$|E
5|$|Significant Other is {{the second}} album by American rap rock band Limp Bizkit. Released in 1999 by Flip/Interscope Records, the album saw the band {{expanding}} its sound from that of its debut album Three <b>Dollar</b> <b>Bill,</b> Yall, to incorporate further metal and hip hop influences. Significant Other was co-produced by Terry Date and Limp Bizkit. The album has sold at least 16 million copies worldwide.|$|E
50|$|Furthermore, {{there is}} {{worldwide}} precedent for mixed material currency as the Singapore Dollar has its 2, 5, and 10 <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> on polymer substrate and their 50, 100, 1000, and 10,000 <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> on paper.|$|R
50|$|In a penny war, {{two or more}} groups {{compete to}} win a {{fundraising}} competition. Each group has a bucket for collecting coins or <b>dollar</b> <b>bills.</b> The value of any pennies collected by a group count positively toward that group's point total, while the value of other coins or <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> are subtracted. Hence, in a competition between Group A and Group B, a contributor who wants Group A to win will place pennies into Group A's bucket and nickels, dimes, quarters, or <b>dollar</b> <b>bills</b> into Group B's bucket.|$|R

The band achieved mainstream success with their second and third studio albums, Significant Other (1999) and Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water (2000), although this success was marred {{by a series of}} controversies surrounding their performances at Woodstock '99 and the 2001 Big Day Out festival.|$|E
5|$|When {{the price}} {{elasticity}} {{of demand for}} a good is perfectly elastic (Ed is − ∞), any increase in the price, no matter how small, will cause the quantity demanded for the good to drop to zero. Hence, when the price is raised, the total revenue falls to zero. This situation is typical for goods that have their value defined by law (such as fiat currency); if a 5 <b>dollar</b> <b>bill</b> were sold for anything more than 5 dollars, nobody would buy it, so demand is zero.|$|E
5|$|Skelton was a Freemason, {{a member}} of Vincennes Lodge No. 1, in Indiana. He also was {{a member of}} both the Scottish and York Rite. He was a {{recipient}} of the Gold Medal of the General Grand Chapter, Royal Arch Masons, for Distinguished Service in the Arts and Sciences. On September 24, 1969, he received the honorary 33rd degree in the Scottish Rite and was a Gourgas Medal recipient in 1995. Skelton became interested in Masonry as a small boy selling newspapers in Vincennes, when a man bought a paper from him with a five <b>dollar</b> <b>bill</b> and told him to keep the change. The young Skelton asked his benefactor why he had given him so much money; the man explained that he was a Mason and Masons are taught to give. Skelton decided to become one also when he was grown. He was also member of the Independent Order of Odd Fellows, as well as a Shriner in Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Stuart painted George Washington in {{a series}} of iconic portraits, each of them leading in turn to a demand for copies, and keeping Stuart busy and highly paid for years. The most famous and celebrated of these likenesses is known as The Athenaeum and is {{currently}} portrayed on the United States one <b>dollar</b> <b>bill.</b> Stuart, along with his daughters, painted a total of 130 reproductions of The Athenaeum. However, he never completed the original version; after finishing Washington's face, he kept the original version to make the copies. He sold up to 70 of his reproductions for a price of US$100 each, but the original portrait was left unfinished at the time of Stuart's death in 1828. The painting was jointly purchased by the National Portrait Gallery and Museum of Fine Arts, Boston in 1980, and was on display in the National Portrait Gallery in Washington, D.C. in late 2014.|$|E

In May, 1848, he became cashier of the state-chartered Bank of Westfield, owned by his brother Sextus, who served as its president. John learned the banking business during this period. As it is still true today, bankers had to not only be good with numbers but also had {{to pay attention to}} detail: Hungerford excelled at both. According to one contemporary account, on Friday, July 9, 1852, Hungerford noticed that someone had passed counterfeit currency, changing a <b>dollar</b> <b>bill</b> into a ten <b>dollar</b> <b>bill.</b> In July 1864, Sextus Hungerford sold the Bank of Westfield to the newly formed First National Bank of Westfield, capitalized at $100,000.00, where he became a director.|$|E
