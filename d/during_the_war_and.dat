In 1915, Speyer offered to resign from the Privy Council and to {{relinquish}} his baronetcy, but the Prime Minister turned down the offer. He resigned as chairman of the UERL and went to the United States. In 1921, the British government investigated accusations that Speyer had traded with the enemy <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>and</b> had participated in other wartime conduct incompatible with his status as a British subject. Speyer denied the charges, but his naturalisation was revoked and he was struck off the list of members of the Privy Council.|$|E
5|$|Although in speeches Seward had {{predicted}} all of North America joining the Union, he had, as a senator, opposed the Gadsden Purchase obtaining land from Mexico, and Buchanan's attempts to purchase Cuba from Spain. Those stands were likely because {{the land to}} be secured might become slave territory. After the Civil War, this {{was no longer an}} issue, and Seward became an ardent expansionist and even contemplated the purchase of Greenland and Iceland. The Union Navy had been hampered {{due to the lack of}} overseas bases <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>and</b> Seward also believed that American trade would be helped by the purchase of overseas territory.|$|E

5|$|Both the St. Louis German and Irish {{communities}} urged neutrality at the 1914 {{outbreak of}} World War I, which {{contributed to a}} resurgent nativism after U.S. entry into the war in 1917. As a result, German St. Louisans suffered some discrimination <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>and</b> St. Louisans repressed elements of German culture. Commerce was not dramatically affected by the war. However, leading up to and before World War I, the population started to decrease as men were needed {{to work at the}} artillery plants and factories that were closer to the Atlantic.|$|E
5|$|Demand for bismuth {{was small}} prior to World War II and was {{pharmaceutical}} – bismuth compounds {{were used to}} treat such conditions as digestive disorders, sexually transmitted infections and burns. Minor amounts of bismuth metal were consumed in fusible alloys for fire sprinkler systems and fuse wire. During World War II bismuth was considered a strategic material, used for solders, fusible alloys, medications and atomic research. To stabilize the market, the producers set the price at $1.25 per pound (2.75 $/kg) <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> at $2.25 per pound (4.96 $/kg) from 1950 until 1964.|$|E

Over 20,000 pigeons and 370 handlers were used <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>and</b> at times, they were the sole means of communication.|$|E
5|$|General Washington {{essentially}} assumed three roles {{during the}} war. First, he provided leadership of troops against the main British forces in 1775–77 {{and again in}} 1781. He lost many of his battles, but he never surrendered his army <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>and</b> he continued to fight the British relentlessly until the war's end. He plotted the overall strategy of the war, in cooperation with Congress.|$|E
5|$|However, {{during this}} time Inglis' {{relationship}} with his brigade commanders, particularly Brigadier Howard Kippenberger deteriorated. Kippenberger had become highly rated as a field commander <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> Inglis may have become resentful. This was uncomfortable for Kippenberger, who had served under Inglis in the Territorial Force and considered him a mentor {{in the art of}} warfare. This was further exacerbated on 30 June when Inglis went to Cairo without informing his staff who, in his absence, subsequently asked Kippenberger to take temporary command of the division. Inglis returned on 1 July having become lost when returning from Cairo.|$|E

5|$|In 1942, {{the campus}} became a War Information Center, one of 140 in the nation. The center was {{established}} to boost civilian morale and practice air raid drills. Rationing on campus of sugar, gas, soft drinks, and paper became common throughout the war. Classes were cut back due to the limited staff and the courses were shifted to more scientific and technological emphasis. The majority of the sports were canceled <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war</b> <b>and</b> various drives were held to increase supplies sent to troops.|$|E
5|$|In a {{departure}} from his usually serious compositions in 1957 to 1963, Lutosławski also composed light music under the pseudonym Derwid. Mostly waltzes, tangos, foxtrots and slow-foxtrots for voice and piano, these pieces are in the genre of Polish actors' songs. Their place in Lutosławski's output {{may be seen as}} less incongruous given his own performances of cabaret music <b>during</b> <b>the</b> <b>war,</b> <b>and</b> in the light of his relationship by marriage to the famous Polish cabaret singer Kalina Jędrusik (who was his wife's sister-in-law).|$|E
