40|$|Workstations for Visual Inspections (WVIs) {{and also}} for Electrical Tests (WETs) of a {{multimedia}} product factory were studied from Ergonomic viewpoints. The problems, identified by subjective assessments and direct observations, were related to poor designs of workstations, work processes and improper tools, causing high (12. 2 ± 4. 1 %) product returns. In some WVIs, operators were having visual fatigue due to excessive magnifying glass usage, glare from inspection templates and too many components to check within a very short period. Some WETs were not organised to reduce hands and body motions, and to eliminate confusing criteria for passing or failing of the tests. They also had poor visual projection tests due to too bright ambient illumination on the screen. The Ergonomic improvements were: the reduced usage of magnifying glass, the use of no-glare templates, visual inspection of only the electrically non-tested components, the re-design of WETs for economy of motion, the improvement on pass or <b>fail</b> <b>criteria,</b> dark space for effective visual projection tests, etc. These ergonomic interventions improved the company's productivity and operators' health, reduced the product returns and saved USD 70, 900 per month...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAs {{lithium ion}} {{batteries}} are adopted in electric vehicles and stationary storage applications, the {{higher number of}} cells and greater energy densities increases the risks of possible catastrophic events. This paper shows a definition and method to calculate the state of safety of an energy storage system based on the concept that safety is inversely proportional {{to the concept of}} abuse. As the latter increases, the former decreases to zero. Previous descriptions in the literature are qualitative in nature but don’t provide a numerical quantification of the safety of a storage system. In the case of battery testing standards, they only define pass or <b>fail</b> <b>criteria.</b> The proposed state uses the same range as other commonly used state quantities like the SOC, SOH, and SOF, taking values between 0, completely unsafe, and 1, completely safe. The developed function combines the effects of an arbitrary number of subfunctions, each of which describes a particular case of abuse, in one or more variables such as voltage, temperature, or mechanical deformation, which can be detected by sensors or estimated by other techniques. The state of safety definition can be made more general by adding new subfunctions, or by refining the existing ones...|$|E
40|$|Catalytic {{converters}} are devices {{attached to}} the exhaust system of automobile or other engines to eliminate or substantially reduce polluting emissions. They consist of coated substrates enclosed in a stainless steel housing. The substrate is typically made of ceramic honeycombs; however stainless steel foil honeycombs are also used. The coating is usually a slurry of alumina, silica, rare earth oxides and platinum group metals. The slurry {{also known as the}} wash coat is applied to the substrate in two doses, one on each end of the substrate; in some cases multiple layers of coating are applied. X-ray imaging is used to inspect the applied coating depth on a substrate to confirm compliance with quality requirements. Automated image analysis techniques are employed to measure the coating depth from the X-ray image. Coating depth is assessed by analysis of attenuation line profiles in the image. Edge detection algorithms with noise reduction and outlier rejection are used to calculate the coating depth at a specified point along an attenuation line profile. Quality control of the product is accomplished using several attenuation line profile regions for coating depth measurements, with individual pass or <b>fail</b> <b>criteria</b> specified for each region...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: The Assessment of Basic Learning Abilities (ABLA) is an empirically {{validated}} clinical {{tool for}} assessing the learning ability of persons with intellectual disabilities and children with autism. An ABLA tester uses standardized prompting and reinforcement procedures to attempt to teach, individually, each of six tasks, called levels, to a testee, until a pass or a <b>fail</b> <b>criterion</b> is met on each level. The six levels are ordered in difficulty from Level 1 to Level 6. We examined the predictive validity of the ABLA performance of nine children with autism who passed ABLA Levels 2 or 3, and failed higher levels. We attempted to teach 20 criterion tasks to each child, using standardized prompting and reinforcement procedures, until each child met either the pass or the <b>fail</b> <b>criterion</b> of the ABLA on each task. We predicted that each child would pass the criterion tasks that corresponded to his/her previously passed ABLA levels, and would <b>fail</b> the <b>criterion</b> tasks that corresponded to his/her previously failed ABLA levels. A parent of each child was also asked to predict the child’s pass-fail learning performance on the 20 criterion tasks. Ninety-two percent of the predictions based on the children’s ABLA performance were confirmed, and the ABLA was significantly more accurate than the parents for predicting the children’s performance on the criterion tasks.

40|$|Background: The current gold {{standard}} of balance testing within elite academy football {{has been shown}} to be time consuming and contain movement requirements non-specific to football. Purpose: To assess the reliability of a new balance protocol for use in elite academy football, due to the difficulty in testing large group sizes and the limited movements patterns with the current {{gold standard}} tests. Methods: 10 Participants completed a series of functional jumps, incorporating forward, lateral and vertical movement and landing strategies, with single leg landings. The participants’ jumps were videoed for retrospective analysis as well as scored in real time by two observers. The subjects balance abilities were graded based on pre-determined criteria derived from the current gold standards of balance testing. Both intra and inter-tester reliability of the functional balance protocol was assessed. Main Results: The results show the FBP has ‘excellent’ inter-rater reliability for both real-time analysis and retrospective video analysis, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 864 to 0. 950. Conclusions: The FBP has excellent intra and inter-rater reliability. The research supplies evidence to suggest that using a functional protocol with an objective <b>fail</b> <b>criteria</b> combining current “gold standard” balance tests, in conjunction with minimal equipment and a short testing duration may be a more appropriate method to test balance...|$|E
40|$|This {{article will}} be {{available}} as gold open access on publication. Adhesion requirements for photovoltaic modules to ensure reliability are often discussed but not well defined, neither in terms of tests nor actual requirements. This paper presents a new approach for realistic assessment of the adhesion strength, which shows the conventional peel test may not ensure reliability. The test presented reproduces the actual adhesion requirements for fielded modules much more closely than the commonly used peel testing. The test is conducted in-situ during standard damp-heat test at a temperature of 85 °C and 85 % relative humidity, with the modules installed {{at an angle to}} give an appropriate force vector perpendicular to the backsheet. This is achieved by attaching weights {{to the back of the}} tested samples which are mounted with a 45 ° angle on a testing rack in the environmental cabinet. With an appropriate weight holder, this could be done as part of the standard damp-heat cycle during certification and would not involve additional testing time nor significant changes in the commonly used racking. This approach will identify the weakest interface of the multilayer encapsulation system. A number of test-to-fail bespoke samples are tested to set realistic <b>fail</b> <b>criteria.</b> It is shown that the test allows discrimination between different samples and can identify unsuitable production processes...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to {{construct}} a conventional motor achievement test battery based on pass or <b>fail</b> <b>criteria</b> for preschool children. Thirty seven items were examined on reliability and objectivity of both observed value (0 V) and measured value (MV); agreement between OV and MV, and discriminating power of items. The thirty seven items were selected from 223 items by taking into account various conditions like a hierarchical structure in fundamental motor ability proposed by Gallahue, possibility of behavior observation, difficulty of task, and so on. As a result, twenty eight items representing each motor pattern of locomotion,manipulation, and stability domains, were reselected. For the purpose mentioned above, using factor analytic procedures, eight motor pattern factors for three domains were extracted and interpreted as folow;: 1) walking-jumping, 2) hopping, 3) climbing for the locomotion type, 1) catching, 2) throwing further, 3) throwing to aim for the manipulation type, 1) maintaining posture, 2) stability during action for the stability type. Examining the factorial validity in addition to taking practicability into consideration, 16 items were chosen at first and 9 items were chosen from them next. Because these test batteries showed a positive relation with another motor test on which performances were measured by CGS scales, they were considered to be practical and effective to estimate motor ability. Finally,assessment scales for two test batteries were constructed, using data of 3564 preschool children aged from three to six...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: We studied {{prostate-specific antigen}} (PSA) changes after {{radiation}} {{with or without}} neoadjuvant androgen deprivation to determine posttreatment PSA scenarios in which false-positive biochemical failures (FPBF) {{are most likely to}} occur. Methods and Materials: In the Trans-Tasman Radiation Oncology 96. 01 Group trial, patients with T 2 b, 2 c, 3, 4 N 0 prostate cancer were randomized to 3 or 6 months goserelin and flutamide (STAD) before and during 66 Gy to the prostate and seminal vesicles (XRT) or to XRT alone. Piecewise longitudinal changes in PSA before relapse were characterized and quantified to determine which might cause FPBF calls. Results: Between 1996 and 2000, 802 eligible patients were randomized. Of these, 492 met the criteria for American Society for Therapeutic Radiology and Oncology (ASTRO) failure and 467 for Phoenix failure. Seventy-seven ASTRO fails and 39 Phoenix fails were deemed false positives (FPs). The majority of FPBFs were associated with the “plateauing” in PSA values that follow posttreatment nadir. FPBFs were particularly common in men treated with STAD, in whom small, consecutive PSA rises before or during this phenomenon triggered 56 FP ASTRO fail calls. In these men, the Phoenix <b>fail</b> <b>criteria</b> triggered only 15 FPBF calls. However, the Phoenix criteria were more vulnerable than ASTRO to short-term isolated PSA rises during plateau, which resulted in 15 Phoenix fail calls but only 3 FP ASTRO fails. Conclusions: The Phoenix definition avoided 50 % of FPBF calls that occurred with the ASTRO definition. Failures should be confirmed by further PSA rises before investigation and treatment is considered...|$|E
40|$|This {{task was}} {{developed}} {{in the wake of the}} Boeing 787 Dreamliner lithium-ion battery TR incidents of January 2013 and January 2014. The Electrical Power Technical Discipline Team supported the Dreamliner investigations and has followed up by applying lessons learned to conduct an introspective evaluation of NASA's risk of similar incidents in its own lithium-ion battery deployments. This activity has demonstrated that historically NASA, like Boeing and others in the aerospace industry, has emphasized the prevention of TR in a single cell within the battery (e. g., cell screening) but has not considered TR severity-reducing measures in the event of a single-cell TR event. center dotIn the recent update of the battery safety standard (JSC 20793) to address this paradigm shift, the NASA community included requirements for assessing TR severity and identifying simple, low-cost severity reduction measures. This task will serve as a pathfinder for meeting those requirements and will specifically look at a number of different lithium-ion batteries currently in the design pipeline within the ISS Program batteries that, should they fail in a Dreamliner-like incident, could result in catastrophic consequences. This test is an abuse test to understand the heat transfer properties of the cell and ORU in thermal runaway, with radiant barriers in place in a flight like test in on orbit conditions.

Defined validation procedures {{are required to}} establish the Standard Operating Procedure (SOP), include pass and <b>fail</b> <b>criteria,</b> as well as implement positivity criteria. However, little to no guidance is provided on how to perform longitudinal assessment of the key reagents utilized in the assay. Through the External Quality Assurance Program Oversight Laboratory (EQAPOL), an Interferon-gamma (IFN-γ) Enzyme-linked immunosorbent spot (ELISpot) assay proficiency testing program is administered. A limit of acceptable within site variability was estimated after six rounds of proficiency testing (PT). Previously, a PT send-out specific within site variability limit was calculated based on the dispersion (variance/mean) of the nine replicate wells of data. Now an overall 'dispersion limit' for the ELISpot PT program within site variability has been calculated as a dispersion of 3. 3. The utility of this metric was assessed using a control sample to calculate the within (precision) and between (accuracy) experiment variability {{to determine if the}} dispersion limit could be applied to bridging studies (studies that assess lot-to-lot variations of key reagents) for comparing the accuracy of results with new lots to results with old lots. Finally, simulations were conducted to explore how this dispersion limit could provide guidance in the number of replicate wells needed for within and between experiment variability and the appropriate donor reactivity (number of antigen-specific cells) to be used for the evaluation of new reagents. Our bridging study simulations indicate using a minimum of six replicate wells of a control donor sample with reactivity of at least 150 spot forming cells per well is optimal.

40|$|Radiation test {{criteria}} {{adopted by}} the IAEA and Euratom for safeguards equipment were evaluated with respect to reliability and safety in nuclear radiation environments. The proposed set of test criteria is not complete. The proposed irradiation values for level 1 ("standard") and level 2 ("high class") have been compared with values measured {{in the field and}} typical radiation protection limits and found to be acceptable. The proposed irradiation level 3 ("special application") seems to be arbitrary, and, therefore, further consideration is suggested. Supplements and recommendations for the test criteria and the irradiation tests are proposed. The test criteria are applicable for the EOSS seal in expected radiation environments in nuclear facilities. The Electronic Optical Sealing System (EOSS) was developed by Dr. Neumann Consultants for safeguards applications by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) and the Euratom Safeguards Office (Euratom). The tests of the EOSS seal with fast and thermal neutrons and gammas had been carried out at the Prater Reactor in Vienna by the Vienna Technical University under contract of the IAEA without participation of FhG-INT. All the measurement records of the irradiation tests made available to FhG-INT were evaluated. According to the tester, the tested seals passed all levels for all radiation types. Because of a lack of definitions of pass and <b>fail</b> <b>criteria,</b> test parameters, dosimetry etc. FhG-INT cannot conclude that the EOSS seal can be used in the field up to the specified irradiation levels. We propose to repeat all radiation tests with 5 to 10 devices after the test criteria have been revised and detailed test specification for the test of the EOSS seal have been agreed between IAEA, the supplier and the tester. The radiation safety analysis of the seal components leads to the conclusion that in the field no problems should be encountered. The implemented lithium batteries can be used in radiation environments, because the temperature in the batteries will not rise due to radiation, no significant amount of gas will be generated, and activation will be low. The neutron-induced radioactivity of the EOSS seal will be rather low, except under accelerated irradiation tests or certain "special application" conditions in the field...|$|E
40|$|In the past, brake {{testing of}} rubber-tyred {{vehicles}} operating in quarries, opencast coal sites, mines and similar environments, comprised ‘simple’ stopping distance tests, typically {{carried out at}} daily or weekly intervals. More recently, many operators of such plant have progressed to using a brake testing method that employs electronic instrumentation, {{as a means of}} determining the ‘brake ratio’ of a vehicle. This is because instrumented testing gives more accurate results. Accordingly, the time between performing these instrumented tests has increased to monthly, or even 3 -monthly, intervals. For both simple and instrumented test methods, international standard ISO 3450 is often (wrongly) used as the guide to acceptable brake performance testing regimes. The ISO standard contains formulae that enable either a stopping distance or a brake ratio to be calculated (depending on which test method is used). However, these calculated values are minimum levels of braking ability necessary for a vehicle to be placed on the market. That is, the ISO standard is a minimum standard for manufacture, not a maintenance standard. To put this into context, it is likely that any ‘modern’ vehicle will have levels of braking performance approaching twice these minimum ISO values. In using these ISO values as routine test pass or <b>fail</b> <b>criteria,</b> organisations may be indirectly accepting that brakes on modern vehicles can deteriorate by up to 50 per cent before their operators become concerned with braking ability. In addition, test conditions on site (particularly speed and gradient) may be much less onerous than those used in ISO 3450, which produces low test results. The overall outcome of this may be a ‘poor’ brake test result, but one that exceeds a low level pass criterion and is not, therefore, seen as a test failure. Another common problem with some brake testing regimes is that they do not readily correlate to site operating conditions; in particular to gradients, but also to vehicle speed and load. The law requires organisations to ‘ensure’ that work equipment is suitable (safe) for the conditions of use it will encounter. This means being able to demonstrate that vehicle braking capabilities are adequate for actual site operating gradients, speeds and loads. Naturally therefore, any testing regime should accurately take account of the site conditions which the vehicle will be exposed to. In order to address these shortcomings regarding brake testing of rubber-tyred vehicles, this guide explains the brake ratio method of brake testing. A step-by-step guide on how to correlate braking performance with actual site conditions and how to design and put in place a suitable brake test regime is preceded by several discussion chapters. The written report was compiled in collaboration with the Health & Safety Executive (HSE), the Off-highway Plant and Equipment Research Centre (OPERC) and the Mineral Products Qualifications Council (MPQC – formerly EPIC) ...|$|E
