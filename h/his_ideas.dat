He coined the term [...] "Konfabulator" [...] to describe <b>his</b> <b>idea,</b> and then tried pitching <b>his</b> <b>idea</b> to other software programmers.

This paper would inspire Schrödinger's work of 1926.|$|E
5|$|Galileo's {{dispute with}} Grassi {{permanently}} alienated {{many of the}} Jesuits who had previously been sympathetic to <b>his</b> <b>ideas,</b> and Galileo {{and his friends were}} convinced that these Jesuits were responsible for bringing about his later condemnation. The evidence for this is at best equivocal, however.|$|E

5|$|The major {{substantive}} {{criticisms of}} Satin's work have remained constant over time. <b>His</b> <b>ideas</b> are sometimes {{said to be}} superficial; they were characterized as childish in the 1960s, naive in the 1970s, poorly reasoned in the 1980s and 1990s, and overly simple in the 2000s. <b>His</b> <b>ideas</b> have also occasionally been seen as not politically serious, or as non-political {{in the sense of}} not being capable of challenging existing power structures. His work is sometimes said to be largely borrowed from others, a charge that first surfaced with regard to his draft dodger manual, and was repeated to varying degree by critics of his books on New Age politics and radical centrism.|$|E

5|$|Weber's {{explanations}} are highly {{specific to the}} historical periods he analysed.

5|$|A {{revival of}} {{interest}} in Hazlitt, as a thinker, began in the mid-20th century.
