25|$|The current {{hypothesis}} {{about the}} evolution of the genes needed for nodulation is that they were recruited from other pathways after a polyploidy event. Several different pathways have been implicated as donating duplicated genes to the pathways need for nodulation. The main donors to the pathway were the genes associated with the arbuscular mycorrhiza symbiosis genes, the pollen tube formation genes and the haemoglobin genes. One of the main genes shown to be shared between the arbuscular mycorrhiza pathway and the nodulation pathway is SYMRK and it is involved in the plant-bacterial recognition. The pollen tube growth is similar to the <b>infection</b> <b>thread</b> development in that infection threads grow in a polar manner that is similar to a pollen tubes polar growth towards the ovules. Both pathways include the same type of enzymes, pectin-degrading cell wall enzymes. The enzymes needed to reduce nitrogen, nitrogenases, require a substantial input of ATP {{but at the same time}} are sensitive to free oxygen. To meet the requirements of this paradoxical situation, the plants express a type of haemoglobin called leghaemoglobin that is believed to be recruited after a duplication event. These three genetic pathways are believed to be part of a gene duplication event then recruited to work in nodulation.|$|E

40|$|Regions of the Rhizobium meliloti {{symbiotic}} plasmid (20 to 40 {{kilobase pairs}} long) containing nodulation (nod) genes {{were transferred to}} Agrobacterium tumefaciens or Escherichia coli by conjugation. The A. tumefaciens and E. coli transconjugants elicited root hair curling {{and the formation of}} ineffective pseudonodules on inoculated alfalfa plants. A tumefaciens elicited pseudonodules formed at a variable frequency, ranging from 15 to 45 %, irrespective of the presence of the Ti plasmid. These pseudonodules developed characteristic nodule meristems, and in some nodules, <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> were found within the interior of nodules. Infrequently, <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> penetrated deformed root hairs, but these threads were found only in a minority of nodules. There was no evidence of bacterial release from the <b>infection</b> <b>threads.</b> In addition to being found within threads, agrobacteria were also found in intercellular spaces and within nodule cells that had senesced. In the latter case, the bacteria appeared to invade the nodule cells independently of <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> and degenerated {{at the same time as}} the senescing host cells. No peribacteroid membranes enclosed any agrobacteria, and no bacteroid differentiation was observed. In contrast to the A. tumefaciens-induced pseudonodules, the E. coli-induced pseudonodules were completely devoid of bacteria; <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> were not found to penetrate root hairs or within nodules. Our results suggest that relatively few Rhizobium genes are involved in the earliest stages of nodulation, and that curling of root hairs and penetration of bacteria via root hair <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> are not prerequisites for nodule meristem formation in alfalfa...|$|R
40|$|Two Rhizobium phaseoli mutants, {{isolated}} previously by Tn 5 mutagenesis, elicited <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> which ceased development prematurely, usually within root hairs.

50|$|Nodules are growths on {{the roots}} of leguminous plants where the {{bacteria}} reside. The plant roots secrete amino acids and sugars into the rhizosphere. The rhizobia move toward the roots and attach to the root hairs. The plant then releases flavanoids, which induce the expression of nod genes within the bacteria. The expression of these genes results {{in the production of}} enzymes called nod factors that initiate root hair curling. During this process, the rhizobia are curled up with the root hair. The rhizobia penetrate the root hair cells with an <b>infection</b> <b>thread</b> that grows through the root hair into the main root. This causes the infected cells to divide and form a nodule. The rhizobia can now begin nitrogen fixation.|$|E
50|$|Nod gene {{expression}} is {{induced by the}} presence of certain flavonoids in the soil, which are secreted by the plant to attract the bacteria. These chemicals induce the formation of NodD, which in turn activates other genes involved in the expression of nod factors and their secretion into the soil. Nod factors induce root-hair curling such that it envelops the bacterium. This is followed by the localized breakdown of the cell wall and the invagination of the plant cell membrane, allowing the bacterium to form an <b>infection</b> <b>thread</b> and enter the root hair. The end result is the nodule, the structure in which nitrogen is fixed. Nod factors act by inducing changes in {{gene expression}} in the legume, most notable the nodulin genes, which are needed for nodule organogenesis.|$|E
50|$|Legumes release {{compounds}} called flavonoids {{from their}} roots, which trigger {{the production of}} nod factors by the bacteria. When the nod factor is sensed by the root, a number of biochemical and morphological changes happen: cell division is triggered in the root to create the nodule, and the root hair growth is redirected to wind around the bacteria multiple times until it fully encapsulates 1 or more bacteria. The bacteria encapsulated divide multiple times, forming a microcolony. From this microcolony, the bacteria enter the developing nodule through a structure called an <b>infection</b> <b>thread,</b> which grows through the root hair into the basal part of the epidermis cell, and onwards into the root cortex; they are then surrounded by a plant-derived membrane and differentiate into bacteroids that fix nitrogen.|$|E

Bacteria accumulated on the epidermis close to root hairs, and subsequently entered the latter via infeciton threads. Most {{of the steps}} involved in nodule formation were generally characteristic of determinate nodules, such as those which form on the closely related #V. radiata$. For example, nodule meristems were induced beneath the root epidermis adjacent to infected root hairs, but prior to {{infection of}} the meristem by rhizobia. Moreover, after the infection {{of some of the}} meristematic cells by the <b>infection</b> <b>threads,</b> and the release of the rhizobia into membrane-bound vesicles, the infection process ceased and dissemination of the rhizobia was division of already-infected host cells. However, there were some aspects of this process in #V. subterranea$ which have been more commonly described in indeterminate nodules. These include long <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> entering a number of cells within the meristems simultaneously and a matrix within <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> which was strongly labelled with immunogold monoclonal antibodies, MAC 236 and MAC 265, which recognize epitopes on an intercellular glycoprotein.

40|$|In most legume nodules, the N 2 -fixing rhizobia {{are present}} as organelle-like {{structures}} inside their host cells. These structures, named symbiosomes, contain {{one or a}} few rhizobia surrounded by a plant membrane. Symbiosome formation requires the release of bacteria from cell-wall-bound <b>infection</b> <b>threads.</b> In primitive legumes, rhizobia are hosted in intracellular <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> that, in contrast to symbiosomes, are bound by a cell wall. The formation of symbiosomes is presumed to represent a major step in the evolution of legume-nodule symbiosis, because symbiosomes facilitate the exchange of metabolites between the two symbionts. Here, we show that the genes, which are essential for initiating nodule formation, are also actively transcribed in mature Medicago truncatula nodules in the region where symbiosome formation occurs. At least one of these genes, encoding the receptor kinase DOES NOT MAKE INFECTIONS 2 (DMI 2) is essential for symbiosome formation. The protein locates to the host cell plasma membrane and to the membrane surrounding the <b>infection</b> <b>threads.</b> A partial reduction of DMI 2 expression causes a phenotype that resembles the infection structures found in primitive legume nodules, because infected cells are occupied by large intracellular <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> instead of by organelle-like symbiosome...|$|R

5000|$|The {{formation}} of the symbiotic relationship involves a signal exchange between both partners that leads to mutual recognition and development of symbiotic structures. The most well understood mechanism {{for the establishment of}} this symbiosis is through intracellular infection. Rhizobia are free living in the soil until they are able to sense flavonoids, derivatives of 2-phenyl-1.4-benzopyrone, which are secreted by the roots of their host plant triggering the accumulation of a large population of cells and eventual attachment to root hairs. These flavonoids then promote the DNA binding activity of NodD which belongs to the LysR family of transcriptional regulators and triggers the secretion of nod factors after the bacteria have entered the root hair. [...] Nod factors trigger a series of complex developmental changes inside the root hair, beginning with root hair curling and followed by the {{formation of}} the <b>infection</b> <b>thread,</b> a cellulose lined tube that the bacteria use to travel down through the root hair into the root cells. The bacteria then infect several other adjacent root cells. This is followed by continuous cell proliferation resulting in the {{formation of the}} root nodule. A second mechanism, used especially by rhizobia which infect aquatic hosts, is called crack entry. In this case, no root hair deformation is observed. Instead the bacteria penetrate between cells, through cracks produced by lateral root emergence.|$|E
40|$|Rhizobium meliloti {{nodulation}} (nod) genes {{required for}} specific infection and nodulation of alfalfa have been cloned. Transposon Tn 5 mutagenesis defined three nod regions spanning 16 kilobases of the pSym megaplasmid.

Root hair curling was determined by both common (region I) and specific (region III) nod transcription units; locus IIIb (nodH gene) positively controlled curling on the homologous host alfalfa, whereas loci IIIa (nodFE) and IIIb (nodH) negatively controlled curling on heterologous hosts. Region I (nodABC) was required for bacterial penetration and <b>infection</b> <b>thread</b> initiation in shepherd's crooks, and the nodFE transcription unit controlled <b>infection</b> <b>thread</b> development within the alfalfa root hair.

40|$|In {{response}} to compatible rhizobia, leguminous plants develop unique plant organs, root nodules, in which rhizobia fix nitrogen into ammonia. During nodule invasion, the rhizobia {{gain access to}} newly divided cells, the nodule primordia, in the root inner cortex through plant-derived cellulose tubes called <b>infection</b> <b>threads.</b> <b>Infection</b> <b>threads</b> begin in curled root hairs and bring rhizobia into the root crossing several cell layers in the process. Ultimately the rhizobia are deposited within nodule primordium cells through a process resembling endocytosis. Plant host mechanisms underlying the formation and regulation of the invasion process are not understood. To identify and clone plant genes required for nodule invasion, recent efforts have focused on Medicago truncatula. In a collaborative effort the nodulation defect in the lin (lumpy infections) mutant was characterized. From an EMS-mutagenized population of M. truncatula, two non-allelic mutants nip (numerous infections with polyphenolics) and sli (sluggish infections) were identified with defects in nodule invasion. <b>Infection</b> <b>threads</b> were found to proliferate abnormally in the nip mutant nodules with only very rare deposition of rhizobia within plant host cells. nip nodules were found to accumulate polyphenolic compounds, indicative of a host defense response.

In contrast, Clark-rj 1 seedlings first nodulated at 12 days, and {{the mean number of}} nodules per plant was only 1. 7 ± 0. 3 at 24 days. Segments from infectible zones of primary roots, i. e. near the position occupied by the root tip at the time of inoculation, were sectioned serially. Clark roots contained cortical cell divisions and a few <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> in question mark-shaped root hairs by 2 days after inoculation. Typical nodules developed soon thereafter. Analogous serially sectioned segments from Clark-rj 1 roots lacked these responses. This prompted us to section nodules and adjacent tissues from other parts of Clark and Clark-rj 1 roots. Clark roots contained cortical cell divisions, many associated with infected root hairs. Cortical cell divisions occasionally were present in Clark-rj 1, and a few <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> were visible in surface cells. The presence of <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> within Clark-rj 1 nodules was confirmed by transmission electron microscopy.

40|$|Nodule {{development}} (ndv) mutants of Rhizobium meliloti cannot invade alfalfa {{to establish}} a nitrogen-fixing symbiosis and instead induce the formation of small, white, unoccupied nodules on alfalfa roots.

Here we show that ndv mutants are severely reduced, although not totally deficient, {{in the ability to}} attach to and initiate infection threads on alfalfa seedlings, and we demonstrate that the symbiotic deficiency can be separated {{from the rest of the}} mutant phenotype by isolating second-site pseudorevertants. Pseudorevertants selected for restoration of motility, a vegetative property, regained a substantial amount of attachment capability but only slight <b>infection</b> <b>thread</b> initiation and symbiotic ability.

40|$|Rhizobia secrete {{nodulation}} (Nod) factors, {{which set}} in motion the formation of nitrogen-fixing root nodules on legume host plants. Nod factors induce several cellular responses in root hair cells within minutes, but also are essential {{for the formation of}} infection threads by which rhizobia enter the root. Based on studies using bacterial mutants, a two-receptor model was proposed, a signaling receptor that induces early responses with low requirements toward Nod factor structure and an entry receptor that controls infection with more stringent demands. Recently, putative Nod factor receptors were shown to be LysM domain receptor kinases. However, mutants in these receptors, in both Lotus japonicus (nfr 1 and nfr 5) and Medicago truncatula (Medicago; nfp), do not support the two-receptor model because they lack all Nod factor-induced responses. LYK 3, the putative Medicago ortholog of NFR 1, has only been studied by RNA interference, showing a role in <b>infection</b> <b>thread</b> formation. Medicago hair curling (hcl) mutants are unable to form curled root hairs, a step preceding <b>infection</b> <b>thread</b> formation. We identified the weak hcl- 4 allele that is blocked during <b>infection</b> <b>thread</b> growth. We show that HCL encodes LYK 3 and, thus, that this receptor, besides infection, also controls root hair curling.

Therefore, LYK 3 functions as the proposed entry receptor, specifically controlling infection.

The pouches were covered and kept in the dark for various times before exposing the upper portions of the plants (cotyledons and hypocotyls) to light. Maximum nodulation occurred if the plants were kept in the dark until 1 day after inoculation. The exposure of plants to light 2 days before inoculation reduced the number of nodules by 50 % while the number of nodules was reduced by 70 % if the plants were kept in the dark until 7 days after inoculation.

The interactions between several rhizobial species and their host plants have become models {{for this type of}} nitrogen-fixing symbiosis. Temperate legumes such as alfalfa, pea, and vetch form indeterminate nodules that arise from root inner and middle cortical cells and grow out from the root via a persistent meristem. During the formation of functional indeterminate nodules, symbiotic bacteria must gain access to the interior of the host root.

The mutant E 2 (sym 5) was infected as often as was the parent, and it formed a normal <b>infection</b> <b>thread.</b> In the mutant, cell divisions rarely occurred in advance of the <b>infection</b> <b>thread,</b> and few nodule primordia were produced. Growing the mutant at a low root temperature or adding Ag+ to the substrate increased the number of cell divisions and nodule primordia. We conclude that, in the E 2 line, the infection process is arrested in the cortex, at the stage of initial cell divisions before the establishment of a nodule primordium...|$|E
40|$|The {{symbiotic}} interaction occurring {{between the}} legume Hedysarum coronarium, a drought-tolerant forage crop relevant for the mediterranean basin, and its natural host-specific, nitrogen-fixing bacterial symbiont, Rhizobium 'hedysari',was studied by combined light and transmission electron microscopy. Several unusual morphological {{features of this}} root nodule symbiosis were found: in nature the plant is able to form modified pseudo-roots called 'shovels'; we observed that these structures can form independently from the presence of bacteria. Computer-assisted image analyses suggested three size classes of root hair lengths, {{one of which was}} longer than 600 µm. The primary infection route is through <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> in deformed root hairs. Transmission electron microscopy of <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> within the nodule revealed an atypical double layered wall. Nodules were indeterminant with an apical meristem, infection zone, and central bacteroid tissue. The predominant shape of differentiated R. 'hedysari' bacteroids is cruciform...|$|R
40|$|Sinorhizobium meliloti is a {{well-known}} symbiont that fixes nitrogen with plants of three genera of the family Leguminosae, Tribe Trifolieae: Medicago, Melilotus, and Trigonella. We have found that S. meliloti strain RCR 2011 forms ineffective nodules on a distantly related legume species, Sesbania macrocarpa. Nodules are indeterminate and lack leghemoglobin. Although S. meliloti deformed root-hairs of S. macrocarpa, <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> were not detected in these cells. Instead, cells of S. meliloti were found in infection pockets between cortical cells and within <b>infection</b> <b>threads</b> that had penetrated into these cells. Bacteria eventually were released and gave rise to symbiosomes, which contained large quantities of an amorphous matrix with parallel arrays of electron-dense striations. Mutants of strain RCR 2011 lacking nodA or nodH failed to nodulate S. macrocarpa, inactivation of nodG or nodE resulted in smaller nodules, while inactivation of region IIa, which contains nodIJ...|$|R
40|$|The purB and purH mutants of Mesorhizobium loti {{exhibited}} purine auxotrophy and nodulation deficiency on Lotus japonicus. In {{the presence}} of adenine, only the purH mutant induced nodule formation and the purB mutant produced few <b>infection</b> <b>threads,</b> suggesting that 5 -aminoimidazole- 4 -carboxamide ribonucleotide biosynthesis catalyzed by PurB {{is required for the}} establishment of symbiosis...|$|R
