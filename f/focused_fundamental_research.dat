40|$|International audienceFundamental {{studies on}} the effects of {{pressure}} on biosystems emerged in the 1960 s and 1970 s while remaining confined to a small community. This situation has changed gradually in the past few years. First, specific interests in high pressure (HP) for the study of macromolecules have been clarified. Second, instrumentation has made progress, extending the range of measurements and relaxing constraints of the HP environment. Third, high-resolution structural methods, NMR, and macromolecular crystallography (MX) have been adapted to HP. These powerful newcomers complete low-resolution methods such as small-angle neutron and X-ray scattering (SANS and SAXS) and spectroscopic techniques such as infrared (IR) and Raman. Accordingly, there is now a toolbox for integrated pressure-perturbed biophysics, including structural and dynamical aspects.

40|$|Recent {{development}} in multimedia processing and network technologies has facilitated {{the distribution and}} sharing of multimedia through networks, and increased the security demands of multimedia contents. Traditional image content protection schemes use extrinsic approaches, such as watermarking or fingerprinting. However, under many circumstances, extrinsic content protection is not possible.

Source coding is a common step of natural image acquisition, so in this paper, we <b>focus</b> on the <b>fundamental</b> <b>research</b> on digital image source coder forensics via intrinsic fingerprints. First, we investigate the unique intrinsic fingerprint of many popular image source encoders, including transform-based coding (both discrete cosine transform and discrete wavelet transform based), subband coding, differential image coding, and also block processing as the traces of evidence. Based on the intrinsic fingerprint of image source encoders, we construct an image source coding forensic detector that identifies which source encoder is applied, what the coding parameters are along with confidence measures of the result.

40|$|Conceptual {{models of}} the quadruple helix have largely taken a macro perspective. While these macro {{perspectives}} have motivated debates and studies, they fall short in understanding value creation activities at the micro level of the quadruple helix. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to address this deficit by <b>focusing</b> on the <b>fundamental</b> <b>research</b> question how value is collectively created, captured, and enhanced at the micro level of the quadruple helix. Drawing on theoretical considerations centred on simmelian ties, boundary work and value postures (motives, creation, destruction, and drivers), we develop a micro level conceptual model of principal investigators (PIs) as value creators in the quadruple helix. Scientists in the PI role engage in boundary spanning activities with other quadruple helix actors. This engagement builds strong simmelian ties with these actors and enables PIs to develop collective value motives by bridging diverse knowledge and creating common value motives. Our conceptual model extends our understanding of the quadruple helix at the micro level and highlights the importance of PIs having strong simmelian in order to realise collective and individual value motives. The paper concludes with some suggestions for future avenues of research on this important topic...|$|R
40|$|Future long-tem {{space travel}} will face {{challenges}} from radiation concerns as the space environment poses health risk to humans in space from radiations with high biological efficiency and adverse post-flight long-term effects. Solar particles events may dramatically affect the crew performance, while Galactic Cosmic Rays will induce a chronic exposure to high-linear-energy-transfer (LET) particles. These types of radiation, not {{present on the}} ground level, can increase {{the probability of a}} fatal cancer later in astronaut life. No feasible shielding is possible from radiation in space, especially for the heavy ion component, as suggested solutions will require a dramatic increase in the mass of the mission. Our <b>research</b> group <b>focuses</b> on <b>fundamental</b> <b>research</b> and strategic analysis leading to better shielding design and to better understanding of the biological mechanisms of radiation damage. We present our recent effort to model DNA damage and tissue damage using computational models based on the physics of heavy ion radiation, DNA structure and DNA damage and repair in human cells. Our particular area of expertise include the clustered DNA damage from high-LET radiation, the visualization of DSBs (DNA double strand breaks) via DNA damage foci, image analysis and the statistics of the foci for different experimental situations, chromosomal aberration formation through DSB misrepair, the kinetics of DSB repair leading to a model-derived spectrum of chromosomal aberrations, and, finally, the simulation of human tissue and the pattern of apoptotic cell damage.

40|$|This {{dissertation}} <b>focuses</b> on <b>fundamental</b> <b>research</b> in {{two areas}} of magnetism, the technologically advanced field of {{magnetic resonance imaging}} (MRI) and the nascent discipline of molecular magnetic materials. Contrast agents for MRI based on the gadolinium(III) ion were designed and studied to gain insight into the parameters that may be modulated to control contrast agent efficacy. Two parameters in particular, the inner-sphere coordination environment and the electronic relaxation of the gadolinium(III) ion, were examined. Investigations into the electronic relaxation of the gadolinium(III) ion led to insights that were applied to the synthesis and evaluation of a low dimensional magnetic material based on ruthenium(III) and nickel(II) ions. Manipulation of the gadolinium(III) coordination sphere {{provided the basis for}} an MRI contrast agent designed {{to be sensitive to the}} oncologically relevant enzyme beta-glucuronidase. This agent functions by restricting water access to the inner-sphere coordination sites of the gadolinium(III) ion. The design, synthesis, magnetic properties and biochemistry of the agent are described in detail. The agent displays good enzyme kinetics and complicated coordination equilibria with water and carbonate ion. A second approach to modulating contrast agent efficacy consisted of varying the electronic relaxation time of the gadolinium(III) ion. Towards this goal, ligand frameworks were designed and synthesized to influence the relaxation time of the gadolinium(III) ion via remote redox activity. Structural characterization and in vitro assays of these ligand-metal constructs indicated more robust ligands were required for complex stability. Initial steps toward a ligand that fulfills these requirements proved successful. The structural data from the electronic relaxation studies led to the synthesis of a one-dimensional coordination polymer comprised of chelated ruthenium(III) and nickel(II) ions bridged by cyanide ligands. The compound was studied by X-ray crystallography and its magnetic properties indicated that the ions were ferromagnetically coupled...|$|R
40|$|In {{terms of}} tonnage, sorghum is Africa’s second most {{important}} cereal. The continent produces about 20 million tonnes of sorghum per annum, {{about one-third of the}} world crop. However, these figures do not do justice to the importance of sorghum in Africa. It is the only viable food grain for many of the world’s most food insecure people. Much of the African continent is characterized by semi-arid and sub-tropical climatic conditions. Africa is the only continent that straddles both tropics. Sorghum originated in Africa. It is uniquely adapted to Africa’s climate, being both drought resistant and able to withstand periods of water-logging. Sorghum in Africa is processed into a very wide variety of attractive and nutritious traditional foods, such as semi-leavened bread, couscous, dumplings and fermented and non-fermented porridges. It is the grain of choice for brewing traditional African beers. Sorghum is also the grain of 21 st century Africa. New products such as instant soft porridge and malt extracts are great successes. In the competitive environment of multinational enterprises, sorghum has been proven to be the best alternative to barley for lager beer brewing.

40|$|Minisatellite DNA {{fingerprinting}} {{was used}} to assign parentage to nestlings produced by stitchbirds breeding on Tiritiri Matangi Island. Analysis revealed that 35 % of nestlings {{were the result of}} extra-pair copulation (EPC) and that extra-pair young were present in 80 % of nests. These results show that an individual's realised reproductive success is very different than that predicted from social relationships alone. Approximately half of the extra-pair fertilisations were by unpaired males. This is in contrast to the general trend in bird literature, which suggests extra-pair paternity is the result of copulations by males paired with other females. EPCs are resisted by females, hence EPC is assumed to be a male-driven reproductive behaviour. Extra-pair males concentrate their copulation attempts at peaks in female fertility. Regular visits made to nest boxes by extra-pair males may provide a cue to female fertility. Behaviour of extra-pair males suggests they also focus attempted EPCs on females at nest sites. Paired males attempt to defend their paternity by defending an area around the nest site by territorial calling and displacing intruding males. These paired males spend a majority of their time near the nest site, both when the female is present and absent. The frequency of EPC attempts varied substantially between nests, and these attempts were often witnessed by the paired male. This variation mirrored closely the variation in the percentage of extra-pair paternity. The level of nest provisioning by males was strongly correlated with the frequency of attempted EPCs, and was less strongly correlated with actual paternity. This suggests that paired males assess their paternity using behavioural cues rather than actually discriminating related from unrelated offspring. Although this thesis <b>focuses</b> on <b>fundamental</b> <b>research,</b> it is closely aligned to stitchbird conservation. The final chapter details management protocols used while monitoring stitchbirds for the first 18 months following translocation to Tiritiri Matangi.

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} was {{to investigate}} flexible polymer-nanoparticle composites with unique magnetic and electrical properties. Toward this goal, two distinct projects were carried out. The first project explored the magneto-dielectric properties and morphology of flexible polymer-nanoparticle composites that possess high permeability (µ), high permittivity (ε) and minimal dielectric, and magnetic loss (tan δε, tan δµ). The main materials challenges were the synthesis of magnetic nanoparticle fillers displaying high saturation magnetization (Ms), limited coercivity, and their homogeneous dispersion in a polymeric matrix. Nanostructured magnetic fillers including polycrystalline iron core-shell nanoparticles, and constructively assembled superparamagnetic iron oxide nanoparticles were synthesized, and dispersed uniformly in an elastomer matrix to minimize conductive losses. The resulting composites have demonstrated promising permittivity (22. 3), permeability (3), and sustained low dielectric (0. 1), magnetic (0. 4) loss for frequencies below 2 GHz. This study demonstrated nanocomposites with tunable magnetic resonance frequency, {{which can be used}} to develop compact and flexible radio frequency devices with high efficiency. The second project <b>focused</b> on <b>fundamental</b> <b>research</b> regarding methods for the design of highly conductive polymer-nanoparticle composites that can maintain high electrical conductivity under tensile strain exceeding 100 %. We investigated a simple solution spraying method to fabricate stretchable conductors based on elastomeric block copolymer fibers and silver nanoparticles. Silver nanoparticles were assembled both in and around block copolymer fibers forming interconnected dual nanoparticle networks, resulting in both in-fiber conductive pathways and additional conductive pathways on the outer surface of the fibers. Stretchable composites with conductivity values reaching 9000 S/cm maintained 56 % of their initial conductivity after 500 cycles at 100 % strain. The developed manufacturing method in this research could pave the way towards direct deposition of flexible electronic devices on any shaped substrate. The electrical and electromechanical properties of these dual silver nanoparticle network composites make them promising materials for the future construction of stretchable circuitry for displays, solar cells, antennas, and strain and tactility sensors...|$|R
