25|$|The {{most notable}} storyline {{featuring}} Diane during her initial stint on the soap concerned the character {{running away from}} home in 1990. In the on-screen events, Diane was shown to be increasingly unhappy towards {{the latter part of}} 1989, exacerbated by the sudden departure of her boyfriend Paul Priestly (Mark Thrippleton). Diane decided to run away from home in January 1990 when it seemed her family had forgotten her 16th birthday—they were actually planning a surprise party for her that she never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see.</b> Diane's disappearance dominated the programme in the beginning of 1990. Focus was placed upon the effect her departure had on the Butcher family, in particular her father Frank who searched unsuccessfully for his missing daughter.|$|E
25|$|In {{the summer}} of 2006, Winfrey and King decided to go on an 11-day road trip across America, from California to New York, 3,600 miles. They were excited to meet people from small towns and see how America really lives. However, the initial {{excitement}} quickly wore off. The friends had minor meltdowns and fought for control over the radio; King likes to have music constantly playing while driving, Winfrey prefers silence. Despite {{the challenges of the}} road trip, they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the beauty of Sedona, meet the people of Navajo Nation, crash a couple of weddings, take a dip in the healing waters of Pagosa Springs, and learn about Amish culture. Winfrey's many driving anxieties and King's tone-deaf singing made the trip a huge hit with viewers.|$|E
25|$|I was {{lobbying}} at the Council of Europe and at Parliament; I {{was over}} in Washington, in Jo'burg, in South America. It was 'let's get guns for the Contras', that sort of stuff. I was enjoying it immensely, I got to go with these guys and fire off AK-47s. I always like to go where the action is, and for that period in the Reagan/Thatcher days, it was great fun, it was all expenses paid and I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the world. I {{used to think that}} World Briefing was a bit funny. The only scary thing about those publications was the mailing listpeople like George Bushand the fact that Hart would talk to the head of British Intelligence for an hour. I used to think it was us having a laugh, putting some loony right-wing sell in, and that somebody somewhere was taking it seriously. You've got to understand that we had a sense of humour about this.|$|E

500|$|During {{a period}} in network {{television}} history when producers were pushing the broadcast boundaries on sexually explicit content with such shows as NYPD Blue, the controversy over this and other television episodes that made inroads into presenting same-sex sexuality or affection led producers not to present any sexualization of their gay and lesbian characters. As noted by author Ron Becker, [...] "So viewers <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Carol and Susan wed on Friends, but they didn't get to see them kiss. And fans of NYPD Blue could hear male hustlers talk about their johns, but the only sex they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> involved the precinct's straight cops—naked butts and all. Clearly, chastity was the price gay characters paid for admission to prime-time television in the 1990s." ...|$|E

500|$|Conflicting reports {{came out}} of the FA as to whether the next manager would be English.

Two weeks later, Capello's England {{qualified}} for Euro 2012 with a 2–2 draw away against Montenegro. In February 2012, Capello resigned following the FA's decision to remove the captaincy of the national side from John Terry, with Englishman Stuart Pearce taking over the role on a caretaker basis.|$|E

500|$|Game Director and creator David Jaffe {{confirmed}} the game {{would be a}} cinematic presentation. He said that at E3, they <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> where players were having issues with the camera system and said, [...] "we are doing extensive focus tests, and using data compiled from E3, to find and fix the problem areas" [...] of the cameras. He said he had the confidence that the team would fix the problems before the game's release. However, he said if players [...] "hate cinematic camera systems, {{nothing we can do}} will help you like the God of War cameras". The game uses Santa Monica's Kinetica engine, which they developed for their previous game, Kinetica (2001).|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Price Peterson, of TV.com, {{gave the}} episode a positive review, writing that he [...] "oved this episode. That reveal was simultaneously shocking and heartbreaking. Plus it {{took one of}} the show's most annoying characters (Trina) and made her both sympathetic and heartbreaking." [...] He also praised the information found on Veronica's mother: [...] "It was nice that Veronica <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a better side of her mother than we usually do…Heartwarming!" [...] Maureen Ryan, of the Chicago Tribune, called the episode [...] "engrossing" [...] and that it is a better use of a viewer's time than Lost, which aired {{at the same time as}} Veronica Mars.|$|E

500|$|Howard R. Cohen {{learned from}} Charles B. Griffith {{that when the}} film was being edited, [...] "there was a point where two scenes would not cut together. It was just a visual jolt, and it didn't work. And they needed {{something}} to bridge that moment. They found in the editing room a nice shot of the moon, and they cut it in, and it worked. Twenty years go by. I'm at the studio one day. Chuck comes running up to me, says, 'You've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> this!' It was a magazine article—eight pages on {{the symbolism of the}} moon in Little Shop of Horrors." [...] According to Corman, the total budget for the production was $30,000. Other sources estimate the budget to be between $22,000 and $100,000.|$|E
500|$|... "Basketball" [...] {{was written}} and {{directed}} by producer Greg Daniels. Although he wrote the episode, Daniels was not originally scheduled to direct [...] "Basketball." [...] Rainn Wilson remarked that he really pushed for Daniels to direct the episode. John Krasinski applauded Daniels for being the first writer to [...] "take [...] out of the office." [...] Daniels later said that his favorite shot from the episode was when Michael takes Ryan {{on a tour of the}} warehouse because [...] "you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the whole basketball [...]" [...] The editors' cut for the episode was 40 minutes long. During the commentary for the episode, Steve Carell argued that the American version of The Office was more difficult to shoot because the British version was 29 minutes long, whereas the American version could only be 22 minutes.|$|E
500|$|The 1923–24 season saw the Senators win {{the season}} but lose the playoff to the Canadiens, 0–1 and 2–4, with Georges Vezina getting the shutout and Morenz scoring 3 goals. [...] Frank Nighbor {{was the first}} winner of the Hart Trophy as 'most {{valuable}} player' for his play in the regular season. After the disappointing loss in the playoff series, goaltender Clint Benedict became embroiled in a controversy with the club over late nights and drinking. [...] He was traded away, along with Harry Broadbent, to the new Montreal Maroons before the next season, for cash. Ottawa hockey fans <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> a Stanley Cup final game played in Ottawa as the Auditorium hosted the final match of the Stanley Cup finals between the Canadiens and the Calgary Tigers, moved because of poor natural ice at the Canadiens' arena.|$|E

500|$|The {{end of the}} storyline was criticised by gay advocates after Charlie {{was seen}} having sex with Hugo Austin (Bernard Curry) and Joey left Summer Bay alone. Anderson also {{suggested}} that Hugo may {{have been enough to}} [...] "sway" [...] Charlie towards men. Some sceptics had suggested that Home and Away would not allow Charlie and Joey to remain in a same-sex relationship. Anderson later acknowledged she had feared that the story would see her typecast as [...] "the lesbian cop." [...] Anderson reflected on the storyline during an interview with The Daily Telegraph, saying [...] "The Charlie/Joey (lesbian) storyline was the first time you <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> Charlie's vulnerable side. (The controversy) blew my mind – I wasn't expecting it at all. I think it was a fantastic storyline because for the first time I got to show the producers and audience what I could do." ...|$|E
500|$|Harring {{described}} her interpretation {{after seeing the}} film: [...] "When I saw it the first time, I {{thought it was the}} story of Hollywood dreams, illusion and obsession. It touches on the idea that nothing is quite as it seems, especially the idea of being a Hollywood movie star. The second and third times I saw it, I thought it dealt with identity. Do we know who we are? And then I kept seeing different things in it... There's no right or wrong to what someone takes away from it or what they think the film is really about. It's a movie that makes you continuously ponder, makes you ask questions. I've heard over and over, 'This is a movie that I'll see again' or 'This is a movie you've <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> again.' It intrigues you. You want to get it, but I don't think it's a movie to be gotten. It's achieved its goal if it makes you ask questions." ...|$|E
500|$|Rumors of Stroud's {{homosexuality}} {{were noted}} at Alcatraz. According to Donald Hurley, {{whose father was}} a guard at Alcatraz, [...] "Whenever Stroud was around anyone, which was seldom, he was watched very closely, as prison officials were very aware of his overt homosexual tendencies." [...] In an interview with Hurley for his book, a former inmate heard Stroud was always in 'dog block' (solitary confinement) or later in the hospital {{because he was a}} 'wolf' (aggressive homosexual) who had a bad temper." [...] In February 1963 Stroud met and talked with actor Burt Lancaster, who portrayed him in The Birdman of Alcatraz. Stroud never <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>see</b> the film or read the book it was based on but did share on {{one of the problems that}} prevented parole, that he was an [...] "admitted homosexual." [...] Lancaster quoted Stroud as saying, [...] "Let's face it, I am 73 years old. Does that answer your question about whether I would be a dangerous homosexual?" ...|$|E
