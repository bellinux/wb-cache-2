5|$|Each {{character}} can use {{one type of}} weapon, in addition to magical spells. The effectiveness of spells depends on the magical ability of the character and the element of the spell {{in relation to the}} enemy. When in battle mode, attacking monsters fills a gauge that allows the player to use character-specific special attacks. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each {{character can}} increase in level to gain improved character statistics such as strength and evasion. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands—a circular menu which <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> the controlled party member. The game is paused whenever the Ring Command menu is activated. Within the Ring, the player has nine slots for storing items; additional items can be placed into item storage, which is inaccessible in combat.|$|E
5|$|Each {{character}} possesses individual {{strengths and}} weaknesses. The hero, while unable to use magic, masters weapons at a quicker rate; {{the girl is}} a healer, able to cast restorative and support spells; and the sprite casts offensive magic to damage and impair enemies. Upon collecting enough experience points in battle, each character increases in level and improves {{in areas such as}} strength and evasion. The trio can rest in towns, where they can regain hit points or purchase restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> the currently controlled party member. The game is momentarily paused whenever the Ring Commands appear.|$|E
5|$|ODST {{takes place}} in the 26th century, when humans under the command of the United Nations Space Command (UNSC) are locked in a war with a theocratic {{alliance}} of alien races known as the Covenant. During the events of the 2004 video game Halo 2, the Covenant discover the location of Earth and launch an assault on the city of New Mombasa in Africa. Though the UNSC manages to repel most of the fleet, a large ship <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> the city, depositing an invasion force. The ship eventually retreats via a slipspace jump, creating a massive shockwave. While the rest of Halo 2s storyline follows the ship to an ancient installation identical to the first Halo, ODST focuses on the aftermath of the shockwave, while the Covenant still occupy the city.|$|E

5|$|The Air Force tracks {{a larger}} UFO as it <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> Townsend. The {{invisible}} alien enters Max's trailer and abducts him. When the agents visit the trailer and find Max missing, an Army radio transmission reveals {{that he has}} been transported to a waterfront. They race to save Max as Henderson's men scour the area searching for him. The alien kills two soldiers who encounter Max, causing him to flee into a warehouse. As Mulder finds Max inside, the building is surrounded by Henderson's forces. Mulder tries to comfort Max, but is attacked and injured by the alien. Mulder then sees Max floating in a pillar of light before vanishing. When Henderson finds that Max is missing, he orders Mulder arrested.|$|E
25|$|The show's {{main focus}} is the {{relationships}} between the characters. These include an off-again on-again flirtation and romance between Dana and Casey, the partnership of Natalie and Jeremy and Dan's ongoing problems with relationships in general. The character of Isaac Jaffe <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> his staff as a benevolent but uncompromising father figure.|$|E

25|$|The common rose {{is often}} the {{preferred}} species to show the amateur naturalist {{the utility of the}} tails in steering. This can be most easily observed when the common rose <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> flowers to sip nectar. Then, its forewings beat readily to give it buoyancy while the tails move delicately to steer and adjust its position.|$|E
25|$|H. bolina {{is known}} for {{maternal}} care, with the females guarding leaves where eggs have been laid. Males are also very territorial and site fidelity increases with age. Territories that enhance the detection of females are preferred. The female <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> a plant to check for ants which will eat her eggs. After selecting a plant which has no ants on it, she lays at least one but often two to five eggs on the undersides of the leaves.|$|E
25|$|When {{the cursor}} <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> a link, {{depending}} on the browser and graphical user interface, some informative text about the link can be shown, popping up, not in a regular window, but in a special hover box, which disappears when the cursor is moved away (sometimes it disappears anyway after a few seconds, and reappears when the cursor is moved away and back). Mozilla Firefox, IE, Opera, and many other web browsers all show the URL. In addition, the URL is commonly shown in the status bar.|$|E

25|$|For all Windows Vista Premium Ready PCs, {{when using}} Alt+Tab to switch between open windows, {{a preview of}} each open window appears instead of just the program icon. In addition, Windows Flip 3D enables users to flip through a {{cascading}} stack of their open windows using the mouse scroll wheel, much like Apple's Cover Flow. Windows can be stacked and rotated in 3D to provide views {{of all of them}} simultaneously. (The keyboard shortcuts are +, which makes Flip 3D disappear after releasing, ++, which keeps Flip 3D visible after releasing, and ++ to flip through open windows backwards). The window buttons on the taskbar show a thumbnail image of the window, when the mouse <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> the button.|$|E
25|$|Seven {{years later}} Mulder {{returns to the}} FBI when the X-Files is re-opened, in order to look into a {{government}} conspiracy when it transpires they have been using alien technology. Along with Scully they investigate several cases together like they had done originally. Six weeks after their return to the X-Files, Mulder confronts an alive Smoking Man to try and prevent him carrying out a plan to depopulate the United States using a virus applied through smallpox vaccines. However Mulder falls sick to the disease but refuses the Smoking Man's help and his proposal to join his elite. Mulder is saved by Agent Miller and they regroup with Scully, however she says Mulder needs a blood transfusion and only their son can give it to them. At that moment, an unidentified flying object <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> the trio.|$|E
25|$|The {{debugger}} allows setting breakpoints (which allow execution to {{be stopped}} temporarily at a certain position) and watches (which monitor the values of variables as the execution progresses). Breakpoints can be conditional, meaning they get triggered when the condition is met. Code can be stepped over, i.e., run one line (of source code) at a time. It can either step into functions to debug inside it, or step over it, i.e., {{the execution of the}} function body isn't available for manual inspection. The debugger supports Edit and Continue, i.e., it allows code to be edited as it is being debugged. When debugging, if the mouse pointer <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> any variable, its current value is displayed in a tooltip ("data tooltips"), where it can also be modified if desired. During coding, the Visual Studio debugger lets certain functions be invoked manually from the Immediate tool window. The parameters to the method are supplied at the Immediate window.|$|E

25|$|Named for donors Michael and Sonja Koerner, Koerner Hall {{opened in}} September 2009 and houses 1,135 seats. It was {{designed}} by KPMB Architects, theatre consultant Anne Minors Performance Consultants, and acoustics company Sound Space Design. It features two balcony tiers above the main orchestra level {{as well as a}} third technical balcony. Koerner Hall's signature element is an acoustically transparent veil of twisting oak strings that forms the backdrop for the chorus at the first balcony level, then <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> the stage below the fixed acoustic canopy, extending into and over the hall at the technical balcony level. Completion of the project also includes three tiers of glass fronted lobbies overlooking Philosopher’s Walk, back-of-house areas for performers, a ground-floor café, and installation of a unique collection of antique musical instruments donated by the Koerner family and valued at $1 million. Each level is also equipped to host a variety of private functions.|$|E

500|$|... "t's not {{forcing the}} issue {{to suggest that the}} Holocaust <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> Barton Fink", writes biographer Ronald Bergan. Others see a more {{specific}} message in the film, particularly Barton's obliviousness to Charlie's homicidal tendencies. Critic Roger Ebert wrote in his 1991 review that the Coens intended to create an allegory for the rise of Nazism. [...] "They paint Fink as an ineffectual and impotent left-wing intellectual, who sells out while telling himself he is doing the right thing, who thinks he understands the 'common man' but does not understand that, for many common men, fascism had a seductive appeal". However, he goes on to say: [...] "It {{would be a mistake to}} insist too much on this aspect of the movie...." ...|$|E

The camera then <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> a playground where dozens of children appear to be dead. Several policemen arrive at the scene and begin to remove the bodies by putting them in wheelbarrows. Meanwhile, Jean Noel is seen running on a desert road. The policemen then begin to dig graves for the corpses. Jean Noel then spots another specimen who looks just like him and the two begin to run. They are soon joined by more specimens before arriving at the playground. By chanting at the policemen, the specimens appear to mind control them into dance. Jean Noel continues to run and stops {{when he sees the}} crashed spaceship. The video ends with the band's jackalope logo.|$|E
500|$|The {{player can}} rest in towns, {{where they can}} regain hit points or {{purchase}} restorative items and equipment. Options such as changing equipment, casting spells, or checking status are performed by cycling through the game's Ring Commands, a circular menu which <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> the currently controlled party member. The Ring Command menu, which lets the player pause the game in combat to select different weapons, spells, and items, was not present in the original game, but was present in the sequels Secret of Mana and Seiken Densetsu 3. A version of the day-and-night system introduced in Seiken Densetsu 3 {{was added to the}} game, whereby some enemies are only present at different times of day, which changes whenever the player enters a new area. Much like Legend of Mana, players can forge weapons and plant produce in an orchard in the game's [...] "Hot House" [...] feature.|$|E
500|$|The song {{received}} mixed {{to positive}} reviews. Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune said {{the song was}} one of several on parent album Graffiti that [...] "flirt with a public apology." [...] Kot went on to state that a [...] "funeral organ" [...] <b>hovers</b> <b>over</b> the song, and [...] "the narrator longs for a second chance: [...] "'So {{where do we go from}} here/With all of this fear in your eyes?'" [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times said that both [...] "Crawl" [...] and another song from Graffiti, [...] "So Cold", come off as [...] "thoughtful, even if they're not quite mea culpas" [...] and further suggested that [...] "In these moments Mr. Brown is pining, mildly apologetic." [...] Leah Greenblatt of Entertainment Weekly called the song a [...] "genuinely affecting second single", and stated that [...] "Less forgiving listeners" [...] looking for [...] "signs of contrition" [...] may find them on the track. Dan Gennoe of Yahoo! Music UK said that, of the six tracks on the album's deluxe edition that could be interpreted as dealing with Brown's relationship with Rihanna directly, [...] "Crawl" [...] is [...] "by far the most catchily contrite." [...] Rap-Up said that the song shows Brown [...] "taking baby steps back to love and into the spotlight," [...] and said that it found Brown [...] "longing to mend a broken relationship" [...] as in his 2008 Jordin Sparks collaboration, “No Air”.|$|E
