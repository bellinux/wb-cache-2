The patent described {{a system in}} which multiple users, each located at a remote terminal, could access data stored at a central computer. A user at a remote terminal would be able to access information stored in a central computer via telephone network. Information would be stored and transmitted in the form of blocks, with each block divided into two parts: a first portion including information to be displayed, and a second portion, not intended for display, which contained the complete addresses of other blocks of information linked to the current <b>display</b> <b>page.</b>|$|E

40|$|The rise of {{computers}} in {{command and control}} domains has meant that control operations can be performed via desk-based visual display terminals. This trend has also produced the potential to display information to operators {{in a variety of}} formats. Of particular interest has been the use of text-based displays for alarm presentation. There are possible limitations to the use of text for alarm presentation, not least of which is the need for a dedicated alarms display screen (or, at least, a <b>display</b> <b>page).</b> Given the capability {{of computers}} to synthesize speech, it is possible that speech-based alarms could generate the same information as text-based displays without the need for dedicated screen space. In this paper an experimental comparison of speech-based and text-based displays for presentation of alarms is reported. The findings show that speech leads to longer response times than text displays, but that it has minimal effect on the efficacy of fault handling. The results are discussed within the alarm initiated activities framework and implications for alarm system design are outlined...|$|E
