25|$|Some {{members of}} the French parliament, {{as well as other}} observers, {{publicly}} decried the intense lobbying by various groups and industries. Bernard Carayon, UMP deputy for the Tarn département, denounced lobbying, pressures and even blackmail on the part of certain groups on national TV. A number of parliamentarians said they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> intense lobbying from all sides, including a grassroot effort from Internet users and free software advocates which inundated them with letters and emails. At one point, Senator Michel Charasse demanded that parliamentary staff clean out corridors of loitering lobbyists.|$|E

25|$|In the 11 November 2007 episode, Simon Cowell retook {{his status}} as the holder of the fastest lap {{with a time of}} 1:45.90. According to Clarkson, the cameramen said they <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> {{consistency}} in the practice laps. However, Cowell was knocked off the top spot in Series 11 by Jay Kay, who now holds the fastest time in the Lacetti, although Clarkson selected the fastest of Jay Kay's times rather than the last run, which was slower than Cowell's time, seemingly due to a dislike of Cowell (he claimed earlier in the episode that Cowell had been {{at the top of the}} leaderboard for too long). Had this not happened, Cowell would have been knocked off the top by Grand Designs host Kevin McCloud.|$|E

500|$|Lewis became {{interested}} in making a film about hustlers because (despite there being films about hustlers dating back more than three decades) he <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a film. In Lewis's own words, [...] "When I started, there were no hustler movies and now there's a whole genre." [...] His original concept for Skin & Bone {{was that it would}} be a series of 70 one-minute shots. Lewis changed his mind about the concept following some improvisation with actor B. Wyatt in creating the Harry character. Much of the film was improvised. After a year of filming improvisation sessions, Lewis wrote some scripted material to provide some story structure. Shooting took several years to complete because the film was almost entirely self-financed.|$|E

500|$|Sparks {{produced}} the album, their first in this genre, {{after it was}} commissioned as a radio musical by Sweden's national broadcasting service, Sveriges Radio. The project was proposed to Sparks by Marie Wennersten of SR Radioteatern, the station's radio drama department. Wennersten had become a Sparks fan after watching the duo perform in Sweden in 2004: [...] "I <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> energy and love from the audience. I thought the Södra Theatre {{was going to take}} off and fly away. I wrote to the Sparks fansite and thanked them for the experience." [...] Wennersten subsequently travelled to Los Angeles as a journalist, to attend and report on another Sparks concert. By that time, the idea of a collaboration had formed in her mind: [...] "I always dreamed of dragging them into the radio world." ...|$|E
500|$|During Governor Shelby's term, the General Assembly {{had passed}} laws {{requiring}} that the governor, auditor, treasurer, {{and secretary of}} state live in Frankfort and allocating a sum of 100 pounds to rent living quarters for the governor. Shortly after Garrard took office, the state commissioners of public buildings reported to the legislature that it would be more financially sensible to construct a house for the governor and his large family than to rent living quarters for them for the duration of his term. On December 4, 1796, the General Assembly passed legislation appropriating 1,200 pounds for the construction of such a house. The state's first governor's mansion was completed in 1798. Garrard incited considerable public interest when, in 1799, he commissioned a local craftsman to build a piano for one of his daughters; most Kentuckians <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a grand instrument, and a considerable number of them flocked to the governor's mansion to see it when it was finished. Kentucky historian Thomas D. Clark also relates that Garrard's addition of carpeting to the mansion [...] a rare amenity at the time [...] drew many visitors and was described by one as [...] "the envy and pride of the community".|$|E

In 1985, under the pseudonym [...] "Rabaith", Fulton, along with Denise Coffey, adapted the French playwright Molière's, Le Bourgeois Gentilhomme as A Wee Touch o' Class.

2500|$|There {{are several}} legends {{connected}} with the City of Brno; {{one of the best}} known is the Legend of the Brno Dragon. It is said that there was a terrible creature terrorizing the citizens of Brno. The people <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a beast before, so they called it a dragon. They trembled in fear of the dragon until a brave man decided to kill the monster by tricking it into eating a carcass filled with lime. In reality the dragon was a crocodile, the preserved body of which is now displayed at the entrance of the Old Town Hall. Crocodile motifs are common in Brno. A [...] "krokodýl" [...] (crocodile in Czech language) is the local stuffed baguette, and the city radio station is known as Radio Krokodýl.|$|E
2500|$|The Roman writer Tacitus, {{himself a}} senator and a historian, {{described}} how when the Roman army, led by Suetonius Paulinus, attacked {{the island of}} Mona (Anglesey, Ynys Môn in Welsh), the legionaries were awestruck on landing {{by the appearance of}} a band of druids, who, with hands uplifted to the sky, poured forth terrible imprecations on the heads of the invaders. He states that these [...] "terrified our soldiers who <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a thing before..." [...] The courage of the Romans, however, soon overcame such fears, according to the Roman historian; the Britons were put to flight, and the sacred groves of Mona were cut down. Tacitus is also the only primary source that gives accounts of druids in Britain, but maintains a hostile point of view, seeing them as ignorant savages.|$|E

The first building that Blacket saw in Sydney Town was the simple copper-clad steeple of Francis Greenway's St. James's Church. He went ashore and found lodgings opposite the little Methodist Chapel with its Doric portico in Princes Street. Sarah wrote home that [...] "almost everyone keeps a carriage" [...] and that Sydney Town had just achieved {{the status of a}} city, the first mayor having been elected. Blacket was a prepossessing young man, handsome, well-mannered, elegantly dressed and with £600 in capital. He soon found suitable employment and the Blackets relinquished their plans to travel on to New Zealand.|$|E

2500|$|The Mormon {{doctrine}} of plural wives was officially announced {{by one of}} the Twelve Apostles, Orson Pratt, and church president Brigham Young in a special conference of the elders of the LDS Church assembled in the Salt Lake Tabernacle on 28August 1852, and reprinted in the Deseret News Extra the following day. The announcement came nine years after the purported original revelation by Joseph Smith, and five years after the Mormon exodus to the Salt Lake Valley following Smith's death in Carthage, Illinois. Young was unable to produce the original document and declared that Smith's widow Emma Smith had burned it. To this, Emma Smith replied that she <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> a document, and concerning the story that she had destroyed the original: [...] "It is false in all its parts, made out of whole cloth, without any foundation in truth." ...|$|E

After being beleaguered on the causeway leading out of the city, Hernán Cortés fled towards Tlaxcala, and was intercepted by a group of warriors of the Tenocha, Tepaneca, Xochimilco and other peoples. However, {{despite the fact that they}} had already seen horses, seeing Spanish knights in full regalia proved to have shock value, as the warriors <b>had</b> <b>never</b> <b>seen</b> <b>such</b> in open battle. The fight lasted for four hours until Cortés attacked a warrior named Cihuacóatl Matlatzincatzin, the tallest and most adorned of the attackers. He and thirteen knights charged the army's leader and killed him. This charge broke the natives’ ranks and they fled. This battle gives Otumba the denomination of [...] "La Heroica Otumba." [...] Despite the poor condition and heavy losses of the Spanish army and the overwhelming number of Aztec warriors, the Spanish prevailed and were able to reach Tlaxcala to regroup. Some 20,000 Aztecs were killed. While the town lends its name to this battle, it really occurred in a place called Temalacatitlán.|$|E
