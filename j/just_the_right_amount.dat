5|$|Bewick {{made use}} of his close {{observation}} of nature, his remarkable visual memory, and his sharp eyesight to create accurate and extremely small details in his wood engravings, which proved to be both a strength and a weakness. If properly printed and closely examined, his prints could be seen to convey subtle clues {{to the character of}} his natural subjects, with humour and feeling. This was achieved by carefully varying the depth of the engraved grooves to provide actual greys, not only black and white, as well as the pattern of the marks to provide texture. But this subtlety of engraving created a serious technical difficulty for his printers; they needed to ink his blocks with <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of ink, mixed so as to be of exactly the right thickness, and to press the block to the paper slowly and carefully, to obtain a result that would satisfy Bewick. Not surprisingly, this made printing slow and expensive. It also created a problem for Bewick's readers; if they lacked his excellent eyesight, they needed a magnifying glass to study his prints, especially the miniature tail-pieces. But the effect was transformative, and wood engraving became the main method of illustrating books for a century. The quality of Bewick's engravings attracted a far wider readership to his books than he had expected: his Fables and Quadrupeds were at the outset intended for children.|$|E

Fleets {{that did not have}} well-drilled, experienced oarsmen and skilled commanders relied more on boarding with superior infantry (such as increasing the complement to 40 soldiers). Ramming attempts were countered by keeping the bow towards the enemy until the enemy crew tired, and then attempting to board as quickly as possible. A double-line formation could be used to achieve a breakthrough by engaging the first line and then rushing the rearguard in to take advantage of weak spots in the enemy's defense. This required superiority in numbers, though, since a shorter front risked being flanked or surrounded.|$|E

40|$|Purpose - Understanding the {{critical}} process variables {{in a system}} and parameters that affects those critical variables will be a strong basis in developing the process control. At the end this will deliver process stability and predictability. Design/Methodology/Approach - Combustion efficiency typically indicates {{the ability of the}} burner to use fuel completely without generating carbon monoxide or leaving hydrocarbon unburned. Excess air is required to ensure a complete combustion of the fuel since a boiler firing without sufficient air or “fuel rich” is operating in a potentially dangerous condition. Getting the optimum combustion efficiency will require the accurate control of fuel gas and the air to deliver <b>the</b> <b>just</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount.</b> Field data analysis and the field experiment will be a basis to determine the applied process control works in maintaining {{the critical}} process variables. Findings - Daily and seasonal changes in temperature and barometric pressure can cause effect on the critical process variables in oil-recovery steam generator, such as steam pressure, temperature, steam dryness and the excess air. Better control means improved process stability, higher production efficiency, consistent product quality, and reduced energy waste. The fact is we pay substantial dollars every time firing the unit. Research limitations / implications: The accuracy of steam quality measurement and the oxygen excess analyser would affect the control capability. Original/Value – Flow control valve application for the fuel gas and the variable speed drive for the air control will improve the combustion efficiency for 2. 0 – 2. 5...|$|R
40|$|Frequency scaling in {{traditional}} computing systems {{has hit the}} power wall and multicore computing is here to stay. Unlike homogeneous multicores which have uniform architecture and instruction set across cores, heterogenous multicores have differentially capable cores to provide optimal performance for specialized functionality. However, this heterogeneity also translates into difficult programming models, and extracting its potential is not trivial. The Cell Broadband Engine by the Sony Toshiba IBM(STI) consortium was amongst the first heterogenous multicore systems with a single Power Processing Unit(PPU) and 8 Synergistic Processor Units (SPUs). We {{address the issue of}} porting an existing sequential C/C++ codebase on to the Cell BE through compiler driven program analysis and profiling. Until parallel programming models evolve, the "interim" solution to performance involves speeding up legacy code by offloading computationally intense parts of a sequential thread to the co-processor; thus using it as an accelerator. Unique architectural characteristics of an accelerator makes this problem quite challenging. On the Cell, these characteristics include limited local store of the SPU, high latency of data transfer between PPU and SPU, lack of branch prediction unit, limited SIMDizability, expensive scalar code etc. In particular, the designers of the Cell have opted for software controlled memory on its SPUs to reduce power consumption and to give programmers more control over the predictability of latency. The lack of a hardware cache on the SPU can create performance bottlenecks because any data that needs to be brought in to the SPU must be brought in using a DMA call. The need for supporting a software controlled cache is thus evident for irregular memory accesses on the SPU. For such a cache to result in improved performance, {{the amount of time spent}} in book-keeping and tracking at run-time should be minimal. Traditional algorithms like LRU, when implemented in software incur overheads on every cache hit because appropriate data structures need to be updated. Such overheads are on off critical path for traditional hardware cache but on the critical path for a software controlled cache. Thus there is a need for better management of "data movement" for the code that is offloaded on to the SPU. This thesis addresses the "code partitioning" problem as well as the "data movement" problem. We present GLIMPSES - a compiler driven profiling tool that analyzes existing C/C++ code for its suitability for porting to the Cell, and presents its results in an interactive visualizer. Software Controlled Cache - an improved eviction policy that exploits information gleaned from memory traces generated through offline profiling. The trace is analyzed to provide guidance for a run-time state machine within the cache manager; resulting in reduced run-time overhead and better performance. The design tradeoffs and several pros and cons of this approach are brought forth as well. It is shown that with <b>just</b> about <b>the</b> <b>right</b> <b>amount</b> of runtime book-keeping and decision making, one can get to the difficult solution space of <b>the</b> <b>right</b> balance to achieve high performance.

40|$|In {{a series}} of recent {{high-profile}} articles, a group of contemporary scholars argue that the criminal law is a grand machine for the administration of suffering. The machine requires calibration, of course. The main standard we use for ours is objective proportionality. We generally punish more serious crimes more severely and aim to inflict the same punishment on similarly situated offenders who commit similar crimes. In the views of these authors, this focus on objective proportionality makes ours a rather crude machine. In particular, it {{ignores the fact that}} 1) different offenders may suffer to a different degree when subjected to the same punishment; 2) different offenders may have different happiness baselines, which may lead to disparities in absolute, subjective, and comparative happiness-to-suffering ratios among offenders subject to the same punishment; and 3) offenders’ self-reported states of happiness and suffering vary {{over the course of a}} sentence, revealing inaccuracies in our objective assessments of severity. These scholars contend that a more sophisticated and rational approach would be to calibrate punishment according to the amount of suffering produced, trading objective proportionality for proportionality in subjective suffering. Looking forward to a day when advances in neuroscience and psychology will provide us with reliable qualitative and quantitative metrics of suffering, these defenders of punishment-as-suffering (“PAS”) are setting the stage now, arguing that no matter our theory of criminal law and punishment — be we retributivists or utilitarians — we are obliged to dial the machine according to who is in its thrall and to titer both the form and extent of punishment so as to achieve <b>just</b> <b>the</b> <b>right</b> kind and <b>amount</b> of suffering. This view of the criminal law may strike some readers as troubling. It should. The problem with PAS can be traced to a crucial equivocation between “punishment,” which is a fundamentally normative concept, and “suffering,” which is one of punishment’s contingent effects, and a derivative failure to distinguish between the justification of punishment and the mechanics of penal practice. Once the elided distinction between punishment and suffering is reconstituted, it is clear that PAS has no bite on traditional theories of punishment, which define punishment objectively. To the contrary, most punishment theorists ought to reject outright the claim that punishment should be calibrated according to the subjective suffering it inflicts. That conclusion is bolstered by the uncomfortable outcomes PAS scholars deploy against objective theories of punishment as purported ad absurdum. While admittedly absurd, those results derive not from premises indigenous to traditional theories but from PAS’s distinctive claim that punishment is suffering...|$|R
