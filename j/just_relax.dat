He goes to circuses, commencements, throws darts, and collects stamps.|$|E
500|$|In late 2003 Farrell starred as a {{criminal}} who plots a bank robbery with Cillian Murphy in the dark comedy Intermission, which held the record for highest-grossing Irish independent film in Irish box-office history {{for three years and}} remains a cult classic there. In 2004, he appeared in several other independent films receiving limited theatrical release in most countries, including A Home at the End of the World (adapted from Michael Cunningham's A Home at the End of the World). Roger Ebert praised Farrell, saying that he was [...] "astonishing in the movie, not least because the character is such a departure from everything he has done before". Mick LaSalle of the San Francisco Chronicle differed, saying that the actor [...] "is keen on making good....The effort is there, but it's a performance you end up rooting for rather than enjoying, because there's no way to <b>just</b> <b>relax</b> and watch".|$|E
500|$|A central {{element of}} the episode’s plot line {{concerns}} the fictional [...] "tween wave" [...] genre of music, which consists of audible flatulence and defecation in a literal sense. In the episode, children love tween wave while adults are generally repelled by it; this joke serves as a commentary on generation gaps. In this sense, Parker related it to the plot line of the Hans Christian Andersen short story [...] "The Emperor's New Clothes". Reviewers interpreted the episode's use of literal feces as just a simple example of the show's use of scatological humor, but also a comment on the dismissiveness of things vulgarly described as [...] "crap" [...] or [...] "shit." [...] Alan Sepinwall of HitFix interpreted the final dialogue as a criticism of those lacking passion, and also an observation on the show's recurring philosophy, which he described as the exact opposite: [...] "how other people care too much about things, and {{that many of our}} big problems and scandals would go away if everyone could <b>just</b> <b>relax</b> and feel less passionate." ...|$|E

500|$|Aaliyah was {{released}} {{five years after}} One in a Million. Aaliyah had not intended for the albums {{to have such a}} gap between them. [...] "I wanted to take a break after One in a Million to <b>just</b> <b>relax,</b> think about how I wanted to approach the next album. Then, when I was ready to start back up, [...] "Romeo" [...] happened, and so I had to take another break and do that film and then do the soundtrack, then promote it. The break turned into a longer break than I anticipated." [...] Connie Johnson of the Los Angeles Times argued that Aaliyah having to focus on her film career may have caused her to not give the album [...] "the attention it merited." [...] Collaborator Timbaland concurred, stating that he was briefly in Australia to work on the album while Aaliyah was filming and did not feel the same production had gone into Aaliyah as One in a Million had. He also said Virgin Records had rushed the album and Aaliyah had specifically requested Missy Elliott and Timbaland work on Aaliyah with her.|$|E
