5|$|<b>Eye</b> <b>color</b> is {{considered}} a subset of coloring, and coat color definitions often include standards for the eyes, as many genes which control <b>eye</b> <b>color</b> will also affect the coat color or vice versa. The American Fancy Rat and Mouse Association (AFRMA) lists black, pink, ruby, and odd-eyed (two different-colored eyes) as possible eye colors, depending on the variety of rat shown. Ruby refers to eyes which at a glance appear black but which are on closer observation a deep, dark red.|$|E
5|$|Some of the {{aforementioned}} differences, such as streaks on the breast, bill shape and <b>eye</b> <b>color</b> are even more prominent in juveniles of the two species.|$|E
5|$|Lemurs {{and humans}} are both {{primates}}. Ancestral primates had brown eyes, as most primates do today. The genetic basis of blue eyes in humans {{has been studied}} in detail and much is known about it. It {{is not the case}} that one gene locus is responsible, say with brown dominant to blue <b>eye</b> <b>color.</b> However, a single locus is responsible for about 80% of the variation. In lemurs, the difference(s) between blue and brown eyes are not completely known, but the same gene locus is not involved.|$|E
50|$|Aliens W, X, Y and Z (Extraterrestes W, X, Y y Z) - The {{antagonist}}s of the film. These four mollusk-like {{aliens are}} hungry {{and the only}} way to survive is to capture and eat creatures from other planets. X (voiced by Esteban Siller) is the one that leaves to capture the animals of the forest, while W, Y and Z stay behind and watch from afar. W (voiced by Eduardo Liñán) is the pink/red <b>eye</b> <b>colored</b> alien, X is the green <b>eye</b> <b>colored</b> alien as well as the main antagonist that fires green lightning bolts from his eyes at any victim in his path, which causes him to change himself into the same victim he sees, Y (voiced by Carlos De Pavia) is the yellow <b>eye</b> <b>colored</b> alien, and Z (voiced by Paco Reséndez) is the blue <b>eye</b> <b>colored</b> alien.|$|R

5|$|When Thomas Hunt Morgan began {{experimenting with}} {{breeding}} the fruit fly Drosophila melanogaster, {{he was a}} saltationist who hoped to demonstrate that a new species could be created in the lab by mutation alone. Instead, the work at his lab between 1910 and 1915 reconfirmed Mendelian genetics and provided solid experimental evidence linking it to chromosomal inheritance. His work also demonstrated that most mutations had relatively small effects, such as a change in <b>eye</b> <b>color,</b> and that rather than creating a new species in a single step, mutations served to increase variation within the existing population.|$|E
5|$|A gene is a {{sequence}} of DNA or RNA which codes for a molecule that has a function. The DNA is first copied into RNA. The RNA can be directly functional or be the intermediate template for a protein that performs a function. The transmission of genes to an organism's offspring {{is the basis of}} the inheritance of phenotypic traits. These genes make up different DNA sequences called genotypes. Genotypes along with environmental and developmental factors determine what the phenotypes will be. Most biological traits are under the influence of polygenes (many different genes) as well as gene–environment interactions. Some genetic traits are instantly visible, such as <b>eye</b> <b>color</b> or number of limbs, and some are not, such as blood type, risk for specific diseases, or the thousands of basic biochemical processes that comprise life.|$|E
5|$|Mengele's {{experiments}} with eyes included attempts to change <b>eye</b> <b>color</b> by injecting chemicals {{into the eyes}} of living subjects and killing people with heterochromatic eyes so that the eyes could be removed and sent to Berlin for study. His experiments on dwarfs and people with physical abnormalities included taking physical measurements, drawing blood, extracting healthy teeth, and treatment with unnecessary drugs and X-rays. Many of the victims were sent to the gas chambers after about two weeks, and their skeletons were sent to Berlin for further study. Mengele sought out pregnant women, on whom he would perform experiments before sending them to the gas chambers. Witness Vera Alexander described how he sewed two Romani twins together back to back in an attempt to create conjoined twins. The children died of gangrene after several days of suffering.|$|E

25|$|The {{color of}} skin can be chocolate-brown, {{elephant}} grey, copper, or mottled. They can be totally one color or one color with tongue pink spots. Albinism is not allowed. The <b>eye</b> <b>color</b> {{is linked to}} the skin color. It is always brown, but dogs with light colors can have clearer eyes than darker-skinned dogs.|$|E
25|$|Chief Matoyi’s son later died {{without an}} heir. A {{relative}} of Matoyi’s son, named Xwebisa (also known as Sango), took {{the position of}} being Chief and also,married Bessie.

25|$|True white horses have unpigmented pink {{skin and}} unpigmented white hair, though <b>eye</b> <b>color</b> varies. The lack of pigment {{in the skin}} and hair {{is caused by the}} absence of pigment-producing cells called melanocytes. Some coat colors are {{characterized}} by light or white-like coats and even pinkish skin, however these white-like coats are not lacking melanocytes. Instead, white-like coat colors result from various changes in the ways melanocytes produce pigment.|$|E

25|$|The loci used in CODIS {{were chosen}} {{because they are}} in regions of noncoding DNA, {{sections}} that do not code for proteins. These sections should not be able to tell investigators any additional information about the person such as their hair or <b>eye</b> <b>color,</b> or their race. However, new advancements in the understanding of genetic markers and ancestry have indicated that the CODIS loci may actually contain some phenotypic information.|$|E

50|$|Changes (lightening or darkening) of <b>eye</b> <b>colors</b> {{during early}} childhood, puberty, pregnancy, and {{sometimes}} after serious trauma (like heterochromia) do represent cause for a plausible argument stating that some eyes can or do change, based on chemical reactions and hormonal changes within the body.|$|R
50|$|In {{an attempt}} {{to move away from}} the {{complexities}} involved in seasonal color systems, some authors have suggested that it is possible to achieve attractive results by focusing instead on the level of contrast between a person's skin tone and his or her hair and <b>eye</b> <b>colors.</b>|$|R
25|$|Some {{phenotypic}} traits can be seen, such as <b>eye</b> <b>color</b> {{while others}} {{can only be}} detected, such as blood type or intelligence. Traits determined by genes can be modified by the animal's surroundings (environment): for example, the general design of a tiger's stripes is inherited, but the specific stripe pattern {{is determined by the}} tiger's surroundings. Another example is a person's height: it is determined by both genetics and nutrition.|$|E
25|$|Recently, in {{time for}} the 2005 {{football}} season, two new mascots, based on the ponies who pull the Schooner, were created, named appropriately, Boomer and Sooner.
