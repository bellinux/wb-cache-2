25|$|Joseph Wortis, {{after seeing}} Sakel {{practice}} it in 1935, introduced {{it to the}} US. British psychiatrists from the Board of Control visited Vienna in 1935 and 1936, and by 1938 31 hospitals in England and Wales had <b>insulin</b> <b>treatment</b> units.

25|$|Insulin coma {{therapy was}} used in most {{hospitals}} in the US and the UK during the 1940s and 1950s. The numbers of patients were restricted by the requirement for intensive medical and nursing supervision {{and the length of}} time it took to complete a course of treatment. For example, at one typical large British psychiatric hospital, Severalls Hospital in Essex, insulin coma treatment was given to 39 patients in 1956. In the same year, 18 patients received modified <b>insulin</b> <b>treatment,</b> while 432 patients were given electroconvulsive treatment.|$|E

40|$|Introduction. Diabetes {{mellitus}} type 1 (T 1 DM) {{in children}} {{is characterized by}} unstable course. A significant number of studies shows that introduction to <b>insulin</b> analogues <b>treatment</b> aims towards better control of the disease. Objective. The assessment of metabolic control in children with T 1 DM that were introduced to <b>insulin</b> analogue <b>treatment</b> {{after many years of}} treatment with classic (human) insulin. Methods. The study included 59 patients 2 - 19 years old (12. 9 ± 3. 8) with T 1 DM, transferred from <b>treatment</b> with human <b>insulin</b> to <b>insulin</b> analogues <b>treatment.</b> Data were obtained directly from patients and their parents, as well as from medical records. Results. The introduction to <b>insulin</b> analogues <b>treatment,</b> leads to a decrease in the value of glycolized haemoglobin (HbA 1 c) after 6 months (9. 27 ± 1. 68 % vs 8. 63 ± 1 : 26 %, p= 0. 06). Average daily dose of insulin expressed per IU/kg of classic and insulin analogue (1. 04 ± 0. 38 vs 1. 03 ± 0. 30; p> 0. 05), remained almost the same. In 39 examinees (66. 1 %), 6 months before the introduction to <b>insulin</b> analogue <b>treatment,</b> severe hypoglicemia was registered and 6 months after the introduction to <b>insulin</b> analogue <b>treatment</b> it appeared in only two examinees (3. 4 %) (p< 0. 001). Ketoacidosis, 6 months before introduction to <b>insulin</b> analogues <b>treatment,</b> appeared in 16 examinees (27. 1 %), while 6 months after it was not registered (p< 0. 001). Conclusion. The use of <b>insulin</b> analogue <b>treatment</b> in childhood provides adequate metabolic control and substantially reduces the risk of acute complications (severe hypoglicemia, ketoacidosis) ...|$|R
25|$|Some psychiatrists {{regarded}} seizures as therapeutic {{and patients}} were sometimes also given electroconvulsive therapy or cardiazol/metrazol convulsive therapy during the coma, {{or on the}} day of the week when they didn’t have <b>insulin</b> <b>treatment.</b> When they were not in a coma, insulin coma patients were kept together in a group and given special treatment and attention. One handbook for psychiatric nurses, written by British psychiatrist Eric Cunningham Dax, instructs nurses to take their insulin patients out walking and occupy them with games and competitions, flower-picking and map-reading, etc. Patients required continuous supervision as there was a danger of hypoglycemic aftershocks after the coma.|$|E
25|$|Insulin {{is a major}} {{regulator}} of endocannabinoid (EC) {{metabolism and}} <b>insulin</b> <b>treatment</b> {{has been shown to}} reduce intracellular ECs, the 2-arachidonylglycerol (2-AG) and anandamide (AEA), which correspond with insulin-sensitive expression changes in enzymes of EC metabolism. In insulin-resistant adipocytes, patterns of insulin-induced enzyme expression is disturbed {{in a manner consistent with}} elevated EC synthesis and reduced EC degradation. Findings suggest that insulin-resistant adipocytes fail to regulate EC metabolism and decrease intracellular EC levels in response to insulin stimulation, whereby obese insulin-resistant individuals exhibit increased concentrations of ECs. This dysregulation contributes to excessive visceral fat accumulation and reduced adiponectin release from abdominal adipose tissue, and further to the onset of several cardiometabolic risk factors that are associated with obesity and type 2 diabetes.|$|E

Alexander Rutherford was buried in Mount Pleasant Cemetery in Edmonton, alongside his family.

In 1954, a mountain in Jasper National Park was named Mount Rutherford. [...] In 1980, the government of Alberta created the Alexander Rutherford Scholarship, which awards more than $20 million annually to high school students selected on the basis of a minimum of a 75% average.

40|$|Previous {{studies have}} shown that amylase levels are reduced {{significantly}} in the pancreas and parotid gland of diabetic rats and that insulin reverses this effect and increases the secretary protein levels. In the pancreas, these changes in amylase pro-tein levels are accompanied by parallel changes in amylase mRNA levels. In the present study, the effects of diabetes and subsequent <b>insulin</b> <b>treatments</b> on contents (per cell) of amylase protein and its mRNA in parotid glands were compared in rats rendered diabetic with an injection of a beta-cell toxin, strep-tozotocin (STZ). Both amylase protein and its mRNA contents were reduced significantly in diabetic rats, compared with con-trol rats, and this reduction was reversed following insulin injections of diabetic rats. In insulin-injected diabetic rats, amylase protein contents increased before a detectable increase in amylase mRNA levels was seen. The mRNA contents of a non-secretory protein, actin, did not change during diabeto-genesis or subsequent <b>insulin</b> <b>treatments.</b> The reductions in parotid contents of amylase and its mRNA in diabetic rats and the reversal of these changes by insulin are similar to those changes that occur in the pancreas under the same conditions. However, the magnitude of these changes in parotid glands was much smaller than in the pancreas, and the effect of insulin on amylase mRNA synthesis was not as immediate as in the latter gland...|$|R

40|$|Objective: Crocinisa saffron {{constituent}} with {{a potent}} anti-oxidant activity. The present {{study investigated the}} effects of crocin and <b>insulin</b> <b>treatments</b> (alone or in combination) on cardiac function and pathology in diabetic rats. Materials and Methods: Diabetes was induced by intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection of streptozotocin (STZ, 50 mg/kg). Thereafter, crocin (5, 10 and 20 mg/kg, i. p.), subcutaneous (s. c.) injection of insulin (4 IU/kg) and their combination were administeredfor eight weeks. Blood glucose level andwhole heart and body weights were measured. Electrocardiography (ECG) was carried out using the lead II. Serum concentrations of lactate dehydrogenase (LDH), creatine kinase-MB isoenzyme (CK-MB), and the heart tissue malodialdehyde (MDA) and superoxide dismutase (SOD) contents were determined. The heart lesions were evaluated by light microscopy. Results: STZ decreased body weight and increased whole heart weight/body weight ratio. It also decreased heart rate, and increased RR and QT intervals and T wave amplitude. STZ increased blood glucose, serum LDH andCK-MB levels, augmentedheart tissue MDA content, decreased SOD content of heart tissue, and produced hemorrhages, degeneration, interstitial edema, and fibroblastic proliferation in the heart tissue. Crocin (10 and 20 mg/kg, i. p.), insulin (4 IU/kg, s. c.) and their combination (5 mg/kg of crocin with 4 IU/kg of <b>insulin)</b> <b>treatments</b> recovered the ECG, biochemical and histopathological changes induced by STZ. Conclusion: The results showed cardioprotective  effects of crocin and insulin in STZ-induced diabetic rats.
