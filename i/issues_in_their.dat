5|$|In India, a 14th-century Indian text {{mentioning}} {{a lesbian}} couple {{who had a}} child {{as a result of}} their lovemaking is an exception to the general silence about female homosexuality. This invisibility disappeared with the release of a film titled Fire in 1996, prompting some theaters in India to be attacked by extremists. Terms used to label homosexuals are often rejected by Indian activists for being the result of imperialist influence, but most discourse on homosexuality centers on men. Women's rights groups in India continue to debate the legitimacy of including lesbian <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> platforms, as lesbians and material focusing on female homosexuality are frequently suppressed.|$|E

25|$|Modern art in Croatia {{began with}} the Secession ideas {{spreading}} from Vienna and Munich, and post-Impressionism from Paris. Young artists would study the latest trends and integrate them into their own work. Many strove to bring a native cultural identity into their art, for example themes of national history and legends, {{and some of the}} artwork following the First World War contained a strong political message against the ruling Austro-Hungarian state. A change was noticeable in 1919 with a move to flatter forms, and signs of cubism and expressionism were evident. In the 1920s, the Earth Group sought to reflect reality and social <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> art, a movement that also saw the development of naive art. By the 1930s there was a return to more simple, classical styles.|$|E

Breckinridge focused on <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> first debate, comparing the Whig Tariff of 1842 to the Democrats' lower Walker tariff, which increased trade and yielded more tax revenue. Instead of answering Breckinridge's points, Letcher appealed to party loyalty, claiming Breckinridge would misrepresent the district [...] "because he is a Democrat". Letcher appealed to Whigs [...] "to protect the grave of Mr. [...] Clay from the impious tread of Democracy", but Breckinridge pointed to his friendly relations with Clay, remarking that Clay's will did not mandate that [...] "his ashes be exhumed" [...] and [...] "thrown into the scale to influence {{the result of the}} present Congressional contest".|$|E

500|$|They {{waited to}} license a game engine until after preproduction, expecting the {{benefits}} of licensing to be more time for the content and gameplay, which Spector reported to be the case. They chose the Unreal engine as it did 80% of what they needed from an engine and was more economical than building from scratch. Their small programming team allowed for a larger design group. The programmers also found the engine accommodating, though it took about nine months to acclimate to the software.

He acknowledged that this precipitated into the Direct3D <b>issues</b> <b>in</b> <b>their</b> final release, which slipped through their quality assurance testing.
