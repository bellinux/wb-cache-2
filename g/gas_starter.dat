25|$|In 2014, when Houser {{was faced}} {{with the threat of}} {{eviction}} from his home in Alabama, he booby-trapped the house by twisting out and igniting the <b>gas</b> <b>starter</b> tube in the fireplace, after removing the logs, in an attempt to make the house catch on fire. In March 2015, a week after his wife filed for divorce, Houser called her and threatened her, then went to a retirement community where his mother lived. There, he threatened to commit suicide outside if she didn't give him money. The mother called Houser's wife and was urged by her to have him hospitalized. Instead, she gave Houser $5,000.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{different}} wings {{known to have}} been fitted to the Parasol both had constant chord and very square tips. [...] They were of fabric covered wood construction. [...] The quite slender fuselage was a mixture of steel tubes and spruce, square sided aft of the cockpits and rounded forwards. [...] The supercharged 226hp (167kW) Armstrong Siddeley Lynx radial engine was smoothly cowled but with its cylinder heads exposed. [...] The observer sat in the front cockpit, allowing him direct access to the dynamometer. [...] This had a control wheel and dial for the force readings, plus a lever with which he could free, read or lock the instrument. [...] The pilot's cockpit, behind and with a view unobstructed by the wing had two unusual controls associated with the measurements. [...] He could engage a pair of dynamometer cams which limited its movement and that of the wings to the 6mm necessary for a force measurement in case of a dynamometer failure. [...] He also controlled an hydraulic brake which was used to stop the engine during measurements and avoid prop wash interference. [...] After a period of gliding flight, the engine could be restarted with a <b>gas</b> <b>starter.</b>|$|E
50|$|Cooktops and ovens are {{a mix of}} gas and electric, while gas {{clothes dryers}} are rather rare. Nearly all homes have a {{fireplace}} with a manual-valve <b>gas</b> <b>starter,</b> and some are now equipped with permanent gas logs with electric switch start. Some homes also have natural gas barbecue grills, formerly sold at utility company stores.|$|E
40|$|A {{software}} {{was developed for}} estimating the overall design layout details of <b>gas</b> turbine engine <b>starter.</b> Using this software {{the weight of a}} <b>gas</b> turbine engine <b>starter</b> to develop a power of 96 KW was calculated for different combinations of compressor pressure ratio and turbine entry temperatures. The weight estimation of the <b>gas</b> turbine engine <b>starter</b> was validated with the weights of the commercially available starters. For three commercially available starters supplied by the sponsorer the off-design performance were predicted at different flight and altitude condition. These three commercial starter performance were compared. This software package {{can be used as a}} preliminary tool to asses the performance of <b>gas</b> turbine engine <b>starters...</b>|$|R

50|$|Designed {{and built}} by Turbomeca, the Palouste was also built under license in Britain by Blackburn and Rolls-Royce. Originally {{conceived}} as an aircraft {{ground support equipment}} <b>starter</b> <b>gas</b> generator, it was used also as propulsion for the Sud-Ouest Djinn and other tip-jet powered helicopters.|$|R

40|$|Utilization of DC motors {{for moving}} the {{mechanical}} drive {{in place of}} the <b>gas</b> <b>starter</b> (prime mover). Which controlled by a controller to regulate the movement of the voltage controlled DC motor power window. Change of generator output voltage will read the sensor voltage Vout generator converted to a voltage which in this Vdc. Voltage read ATMEGA 8 Mickrokontroler IC by using the ADC will determine the movement of the motor as the controller of gas, if the voltage is less than 220 V to its minimum voltage of the motor which has coupled on gas prime movers will rotate clockwise so the motor is pulling gas to reach the expected speed of the generator and its reverse in case of overspeed which causes more stress then the generator will rotate anti-clockwise so that the gas will drop to adjust the speed generator. So, rotation of DC motors forward and reverse and at a predetermined voltage level is normal voltage 220 - 230 V motor will stop, and will hold the gas engine driving the generator speed will be maintained so long as the voltage under normal conditions 220 - 230 V. ...|$|E
5000|$|Continuous, short-arc, high {{pressure}} xenon arc lamps have a color temperature closely approximating noon sunlight {{and are used}} in solar simulators. That is, the chromaticity of these lamps closely approximates a heated black body radiator at {{the temperature of the}} Sun. First introduced in the 1940s, these lamps replaced the shorter-lived carbon arc lamps in movie projectors. They are also employed in typical 35mm, IMAX, and digital film projection systems. They are an excellent source of short wavelength ultraviolet radiation and have intense emissions in the near infrared used in some night vision systems. Xenon is used as a <b>starter</b> <b>gas</b> in HID automotive headlights, and high-end [...] "tactical" [...] flashlights.|$|R
25|$|When {{power is}} first {{applied to the}} circuit, {{there will be a}} glow {{discharge}} across the electrodes in the starter lamp. This heats the <b>gas</b> in the <b>starter</b> and causes one of the bi-metallic contacts to bend towards the other. When the contacts touch, the two filaments of the fluorescent lamp and the ballast will effectively be switched in series to the supply voltage. The current through the filaments causes them to heat up and emit electrons into the tube gas by thermionic emission. In the starter, the touching contacts short out the voltage sustaining the glow discharge, extinguishing it so the gas cools down and no longer heats the bi-metallic switch, which opens within a second or two. The current through the filaments and the inductive ballast is abruptly interrupted, leaving the full line voltage applied between the filaments at the ends of the tube and generating an inductive kick which provides the high voltage needed to start the lamp. The lamp will fail to strike if the filaments are not hot enough, in which case the cycle repeats; several cycles are usually needed, which causes flickering and clicking during starting (older thermal starters behaved better in this respect). A power factor correction (PFC) capacitor draws leading current from the mains to compensate for the lagging current drawn by the lamp circuit.|$|R
