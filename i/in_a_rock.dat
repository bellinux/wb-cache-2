5|$|The {{temple was}} {{discovered}} {{by a team of}} archaeologists from the ASI based on clues found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> inscription left exposed by the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami. Initially, excavations revealed an 8th-century Pallava-era shrine. Further excavations revealed that the 8th-century shrine had been built on the brick foundation of an earlier shrine. The brick shrine has been dated to the Sangam period.|$|E
5|$|Doors and vents {{often had}} sills of {{carefully}} ground flat stone slabs and lintels constructed from {{a row of}} thin wood beams. Chacoan masons also frequently included intramural beams – horizontal logs completely enclosed in the wall core – which were probably intended to reduce horizontal deformation of the wall. The interior walls of great houses were typically covered <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> veneer. Judd identified four distinct types, and his typology is the most commonly accepted in the region. Chetro Ketl's interior walls, particularly those in the eastern wing, were covered in a Type IV veneer characterized by uniform pieces of sandstone with little to no exposed mortar. Judd excluded a fifth type of masonry, called McElmo style, from his typology.|$|E
5|$|Quadrophenia was revived for a {{film version}} in 1979, {{directed}} by Franc Roddam. The film attempted to portray an accurate visual interpretation of Townshend's vision of Jimmy and his surroundings, and included Phil Daniels as Jimmy and Sting as the Ace Face. Unlike the Tommy film, the music was largely relegated to the background, and was not performed by the cast as <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> opera. The film soundtrack included three additional songs written by Townshend, which were Kenney Jones' first recordings as an official member of the Who. The film was a commercial and critical success, as it conveniently coincided with the mod revival movement of the late 1970s.|$|E

5|$|Six-year-old Maisie (Onata Aprile) {{lives in}} a New York {{apartment}} with her parents, Susanna (Julianne Moore), a singer <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> band, and Beale (Steve Coogan), an international art dealer. Susanna and Beale argue with each other viciously and constantly, often ignoring Maisie and leaving her {{in the care of}} their nanny, Margo (Joanna Vanderham). Maisie does not always understand her parents' actions, such as when Susanna hires a locksmith to change the lock on the apartment's front door to keep Beale out. When they decide to separate, both parents are granted joint custody of Maisie.|$|E

5|$|Music {{from the}} series {{has also been}} played in {{specific}} Final Fantasy concerts and concert series. After {{the success of the}} 20020220 Music from Final Fantasy concert in 2002, a recording of which was produced as an album, the Tour de Japon: Music from Final Fantasy, was launched in Japan in 2004. It was followed by the Dear Friends -Music from Final Fantasy- tour in the United States that same year, which was originally scheduled to be a single concert but grew into a year-long tour. In 2005, a concert entitled More Friends: Music from Final Fantasy was performed to coincide with the one-year anniversary of the first Dear Friends concert and also had an album published of the performance. The latest Final Fantasy tour is the worldwide Distant Worlds: Music from Final Fantasy tour, which began in Sweden in 2007 and still continues to date. A recording of its first performance was released as an album. Nobuo Uematsu additionally plays with The Black Mages, a band which performs Final Fantasy music <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> music style.

5|$|The final {{enemy is}} Lorenzo, {{who seemed to}} be an ally, but who now menaces Fiona in several {{different}} forms. Fiona first meets him as an old, crippled man. He tells Fiona that Riccardo was always the problem child, and that he created both Riccardo and Ugo in an attempt to find a body with an Azoth which he could use to gain immortality. Ugo had the Azoth, but left the castle to marry Ayla. Now with Riccardo dead, Lorenzo believes that Fiona is his, so he can take the Azoth she inherited from her father. He chases after Fiona, but she is able to crush him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>rock</b> press. However, she soon encounters a resurrected, youthful Lorenzo; the life energy he acquired from Riccardo's body has allowed him mastery over his own aging process. With the help of Hewie, Fiona causes Lorenzo to fall into a pit of lava. At this point, the castle begins to shake and collapse, and Lorenzo returns as a flaming skeleton. He chases Fiona as she heads for the exit, and attempts to block her escape, but as they reach the door, he finally dies, and Fiona and Hewie leave the castle.|$|E

25|$|Most {{sedimentary}} rocks contain either quartz (especially siliciclastic rocks) or calcite (especially carbonate rocks).

However, {{the origin of}} the minerals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sedimentary <b>rock</b> is often more complex than <b>in</b> <b>an</b> igneous <b>rock.</b> Minerals <b>in</b> <b>a</b> sedimentary <b>rock</b> can have formed by precipitation during sedimentation or by diagenesis. In the second case, the mineral precipitate can have grown over an older generation of cement. A complex diagenetic history can be studied by optical mineralogy, using a petrographic microscope.|$|R
