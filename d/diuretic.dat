40|$|Thiazide <b>diuretics</b> are {{recommended}} as first-line therapy for hypertension and {{are among the}} most commonly prescribed drugs worldwide. According to their molecular structure, thiazide <b>diuretics</b> can be divided in thiazide-type (TT) and thiazide-like (TL) <b>diuretics.</b> TL <b>diuretics</b> have a longer elimination half-life compared with TT <b>diuretics</b> and have been shown to exert additional pharmacological effects, which may differently affect cardiovascular risk. In this meta-analysis, we compared the effects of TT and TL <b>diuretics</b> on cardiovascular events and mortality. Randomized, controlled studies in adult hypertensive patients that compared TT or TL <b>diuretics</b> with placebo or antihypertensive drugs and had ≥ 1 year follow-up were included. Primary outcome was cardiovascular events; secondary outcomes included coronary events, heart failure, cerebrovascular events, and all-cause mortality. Meta-regression analysis was used to identify confounders and correct for the achieved blood pressure reductions. Twenty-one studies with > 480 [*] 000 patient-years were included. Outcomes were not affected by heterogeneity in age, sex, and ethnicity among included studies, whereas larger blood pressure reductions were significantly associated with increased risk reductions for all outcomes (P < 0. 001).

40|$|Objective: Use of <b>diuretics</b> {{has been}} {{associated}} with an increased risk of gout. Data for different types of <b>diuretics</b> are scarce. This study investigated the association between use of loop <b>diuretics,</b> thiazide or thiazide-like <b>diuretics,</b> and potassium sparing agents and the risk of developing incident gout. Methods: We conducted a retrospective population-based case-control analysis using the General Practice Research Database (GPRD) from the United Kingdom. We identified case patients with incident gout between 1995 and 2010. We matched one control patient to each case patient on age, sex, general practice, calendar time, and years of active history in the database, used conditional logistic regression to calculate odds ratios (ORs) with 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), and adjusted for potential confounders. Results: We identified 91, 530 incident cases of gout and the same number of matched controls. Compared to past-use of the respective drug class, adjusted ORs for current use of loop <b>diuretics,</b> thiazide <b>diuretics,</b> thiazide-like <b>diuretics,</b> and potassium sparing <b>diuretics</b> were 2. 64 (95 % CI 2. 47 - 2. 83), 1. 70 (95 % CI 1. 62 - 1. 79), 2. 30 (95 % CI 1. 95 - 2. 70), and 1. 06 (95 % CI 0. 91 - 1. 23), respectively. Combined use of loop <b>diuretics</b> and thiazide <b>diuretics</b> was associated with the highest relative risk estimates of gout (adj. OR 4. 65, 95 % CI 3. 51 - 6. 16). Current use of calcium channel blockers or losartan slightly attenuated the risk of gout in users of various <b>diuretics.</b> Conclusion: Use of loop, thiazide, and thiazide-like <b>diuretics,</b> but not use of potassium-sparing agents, was associated with an increased risk of incident gout. © 2013 American College of Rheumatology...|$|R

5|$|Bangladesh had {{struggled}} {{to come to}} terms with International cricket since becoming the tenth Test team in November 2000. Before their 2003 tour of Australian, Bangladesh had only one Test draw, which came against lowly ranked Zimbabwe, and not a single test win. Their One Day International (ODI) form had also been poor since their historic victory over Pakistan in the 1999 Cricket World Cup. The victory subsequently paved the way for their admission to Test cricket. In Bangladesh's last series before Australia, they were defeated by an innings in both matches by South Africa. Australia, however, had a 31 away Test victorystarting in Aprilagainst the West Indies, and a 43 ODI victory over the same opposition. Earlier in the year, they remained unbeaten (10 matches) in winning the 2003 ODI Cricket World Cup in South Africa. Led by Ricky Ponting, Australia defeated India in the final, despite losing leg-spiner Shane Warne.

40|$|Background: Loop <b>diuretics</b> are an {{integral}} part of heart failure management. It has been shown that loop <b>diuretics</b> cause thiamine deficiency (TD) by increasing its urinary loss. The aim of this study was to determine the prevalence of TD in heart failure patients on long-term oral loop <b>diuretics.</b> Methods: Heart failure patients (cases) on oral loop <b>diuretics</b> (furosemide ≥ 40 mg/day or torsemide ≥ 20 mg/day), irrespective of the cause of heart failure, were compared to non-heart failure patients (controls) not on loop <b>diuretics</b> in a 1 : 1 ratio. Whole blood free thiamine level was determined by liquid chromatography-tandem mass spectrometry method. Results: A total of 100 subjects were enrolled in a 1 : 1 ratio (50 cases and 50 controls). 67 % of the total study population had TD, (defined as whole blood free thiamine level < 0. 7 ng/ml).

Conclusions: • Thiazide <b>diuretics</b> improve mortality and stroke in hypertensive patients. Thiazides are recommended as first line blood pressure lowering agents by the Joint National Committee on Prevention, Detection, Evaluation and Treatment of high Blood Pressure (JNC 7) treatment guidelines in adults 5 and by other national treatment guidelines in children 6, adolescents 6 and the elderly 7. • There is insufficient evidence demonstrating efficacy and safety differences among different thiazide <b>diuretics.</b> • Loop <b>diuretics</b> lower blood pressure modestly but play a role in heart failure patients with reduced left ventricular ejection fraction (LVEF) who are symptomatic with fluid retention. They are recommended over thiazide <b>diuretics</b> in severe heart failure.

5|$|While {{many sources}} {{recommend}} additional intravenous agents to reduce {{damage to the}} kidney, most of the evidence supporting this practice comes from animal studies, and is inconsistent and conflicting. Mannitol acts by osmosis to enhance urine production and is thought to prevent myoglobin deposition in the kidney, but its efficacy has not been shown in studies {{and there is a}} risk of worsening kidney function. The addition of bicarbonate to the intravenous fluids may alleviate acidosis (high acid level of the blood) and make the urine more alkaline to prevent cast formation in the kidneys; evidence suggesting that bicarbonate has benefits above saline alone is limited, and it can worsen hypocalcemia by enhancing calcium and phosphate deposition in the tissues. If urine alkalinization is used, the pH of the urine is kept at 6.5 or above. Furosemide, a loop <b>diuretic,</b> is often used to ensure sufficient urine production, but evidence that this prevents kidney failure is lacking.|$|E
5|$|Neuroimaging {{is helpful}} but not {{flawless}} in detecting raised ICP. A more accurate {{way to measure}} ICP is to place a catheter into a ventricle of the brain, which has {{the added benefit of}} allowing cerebrospinal fluid to drain, releasing pressure in the skull. Treatment of raised ICP may be as simple as tilting the patient's bed and straightening the head to promote blood flow through the veins of the neck. Sedatives, analgesics and paralytic agents are often used. Hypertonic saline can improve ICP by reducing the amount of cerebral water (swelling), though it is used with caution to avoid electrolyte imbalances or heart failure. Mannitol, an osmotic <b>diuretic,</b> appears to be equally effective at reducing ICP. Some concerns; however, have been raised regarding some of the studies performed. Diuretics, drugs that increase urine output to reduce excessive fluid in the system, may be used to treat high intracranial pressures, but may cause hypovolemia (insufficient blood volume). Hyperventilation (larger and/or faster breaths) reduces carbon dioxide levels and causes blood vessels to constrict; this decreases blood flow to the brain and reduces ICP, but it potentially causes ischemia and is, therefore, used only in the short term. Administration of corticosteroids is associated with an increased risk of death, and so it is recommended that they not be given routinely.|$|E
