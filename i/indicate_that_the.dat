30|$|I {{checked the}} press {{releases}} for several DVA disclosures and constructed respective binary variables (see similar: Baumker et al. 2014). Ment, <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> quarterly earnings press release mentions DVAs. Sign <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains {{information on the}} DVAs’ sign (i.e., whether DVAs are positive or negative). Size <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains the DVAs’ size as an absolute or per share figure. 3 Due <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains information explaining that DVAs stem from a change in debt value or from a change in credit risk. Dir <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains directional information on DVAs. For example, in firm-quarters with negative DVAs, Dir <b>indicates</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> press release contains <b>the</b> information <b>that</b> <b>the</b> negative DVAs stem from an increase in own debt’s value and/or that they stem from {{a decrease in the}} firm’s own credit risk. According to experimental evidence, this information helps investors unravel the criticized “counterintuitiveness” of DVAs (Gaynor et al. 2011).|$|R
