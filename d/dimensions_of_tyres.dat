40|$|The paper {{applies to}} the issue of {{preservation}} of passenger vehicles during overcoming the roadblocks on a dry asphalt surface with the constant speed. The study aimed to estimate the forces which are affecting the suspension of the vehicle during the contact between a tyre and roadblock. Using the video recording it is possible to calculate the values <b>of</b> the <b>tyre</b> deflection and forces acting in the system. The obtained deflections <b>of</b> the <b>tyres</b> were compared to earlier laboratory test results and load-deflection characteristics <b>of</b> the <b>tyres</b> with the same size. The roadblock with the defined geometry causes a dynamic deflection <b>of</b> the <b>tyre.</b> During the study a significant change in the geometry of the suspension has not occurred. The paper presents the characteristics of the vehicles research with a particular regard to model and type <b>of</b> <b>tyres.</b> The determination <b>of</b> the exact <b>dimensions</b> <b>of</b> the roadblocks and application of the ADIS 16385 system for acquisition and archiving the features of the kinematic motion of the vehicle allowed to determine the speed at the moment of collision with the roadblock...|$|R

40|$|Mixtures <b>of</b> {{shredded}} <b>tyres</b> {{with sand}} have become accepted geo-materials {{in the past}} decade, especially for use as fill materials. Owing to the large size <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds commonly used in practice, large-scale direct shear testing equipment is specially fabricated to obtain the shear strength parameters of mixtures. The effect <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shred-tosand mixing ratio on the mechanical response of the mixtures is studied by performing direct shear tests on mixtures prepared at different mixing ratios. Out of the four types of samples tested, three (with mixing ratios of 20 / 80, 25 / 75 and 35 / 65 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shreds to sand) are prepared using 50 to 100 mm long tyre shreds and one (25 / 75 by weight <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> chips to sand) using tyre chips with nominal size of 9. 5 mm. The end-of-test friction angle <b>of</b> all the <b>tyre</b> shred-sand mixtures considered in this research is in the 30 - 33 degrees range. Results of direct shear testing {{from the present study}} and other studies in the literature show that the shear strength <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> shred-sand mixtures is greater than that <b>of</b> <b>tyre</b> chip-sand mixtures because the elongated tyre shred pieces are able to provide greater reinforcement effects than are possible with equidimensional (cubical) tyre chips...|$|R
