5|$|The {{brain of}} Allosaurus, as {{interpreted}} from spiral CT scanning of an endocast, was {{more consistent with}} crocodilian brains {{than those of the}} other living archosaurs, birds. The structure of the vestibular apparatus indicates that the skull was held nearly horizontal, as opposed to strongly tipped up or down. The structure of the inner ear was like that of a crocodilian, and so Allosaurus probably could have heard lower frequencies best, and would have had trouble with subtle sounds. The olfactory bulbs were large and seem to have been well suited for detecting odors, although the area <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> smells was relatively small.|$|E
5|$|Airborne Research Integrated Experiments System – ARIES, a NASA {{platform}} for air safety and operational research, {{was created in}} 1999 using the second production 757. The aircraft originally flew in the 757 flight test program before entering service with Eastern Air Lines. After NASA purchased the aircraft in 1994 to replace its 737-100 testbed, it was initially used to evaluate a hybrid laminar flow control system, avionics systems for the proposed Northrop YF-23 jet fighter, and the 777's fly-by-wire control system. Equipped with a flight deck research station, on-board laboratories, and two experimental flight decks, ARIES was used <b>for</b> <b>evaluating</b> weather information and landing approach systems, as well as runway friction tests. ARIES went into storage in 2006.|$|E
