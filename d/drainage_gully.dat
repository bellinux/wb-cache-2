The earliest features {{encountered in the}} Phase 1 excavation area comprised a series of short ditch segments, a number of which were shown to be of middle to late Bronze Age date. These were cut by two Bronze Age gullies, possibly to create a continuous ditch line. The exact function of these features remains uncertain, {{but it is possible}} that they relate to land division, form part of a 'territorial marker', or represent the remains of a former causewayed enclosure after the original causeways have been removed to create an uninterrupted ditch.

In the uplands of the United Kingdom ombrotrophic blanket peatlands commonly exist within Calluna vulgaris (L.) dominated moorland ecosystems.

In this study we examined the variation in ecosystem CO 2 respiration and net CH 4 fluxes from typical plant-soil systems in dendritic <b>drainage</b> <b>gullies</b> and adjacent blanket peat during the growing season. Typically, Eriophorum spp., Sphagnum spp. and mixed grasses occupied gullies while C. vulgaris dominated in adjacent blanket peat. Gross CO 2 respiration was highest {{in the areas of}} Eriophorum spp. (650 ± 140 mg CO 2 m− 2 h− 1) compared to those with Sphagnum spp. (338 ± 49 mg CO 2 m− 2 h− 1), mixed grasses (342 ± 91 mg CO 2 m− 2 h− 1) and C. vulgaris (174 ± 63 mg CO 2 m− 2 h− 1). Measurements of the net CH 4 flux showed higher fluxes from the Eriophorum spp (2. 2 ± 0. 6 mg CH 4 m− 2 h− 1) locations compared to the Sphagnum spp. (0. 6 ± 0. 4 mg CH 4 m− 2 h− 1), mixed grasses (0. 1 ± 0. 1 mg CH 4 m− 2 h− 1) and a negligible flux detected from C. vulgaris (0. 0 ± 0. 0 mg CH 4 m− 2 h− 1) locations. A GIS approach was applied to calculate the contribution of gullies to landscape scale greenhouse gas fluxes. Findings from the Moor House National Nature Reserve in the UK showed that although gullies occupied only 9. 3 % of the total land surface, gullies accounted for 95. 8 % and 21. 6 % of the peatland net CH 4 and CO 2 respiratory fluxes, respectively.

Initial indications are that the current means of erosion-control through the use of stone linings and brush check dams has mixed success.

40|$|There {{is concern}} that {{ecosystem}} {{services provided by}} blanket peatlands have come under threat due to increasing degradation. Blanket peatlands are subject {{to a wide range}} of drivers of degradation and are topographically variable. As a result, many degradation forms can develop, including those resulting from eroding artificial <b>drainage,</b> incising <b>gullies</b> and areas of bare peat. Many degraded blanket peatlands have undergone restoration measures since the turn of the century. However, there has been little formal communication of the techniques used and their success. Using practitioner knowledge and a review of the available literature, this paper discusses the methodologies used for restoring sloping blanket peatlands. It then considers current understanding of the impact of restoration on blanket peatland ecosystem services. There is a paucity of research investigating impacts of several common restoration techniques and much more is needed if informed management decisions are to be made and funding is to be appropriately spent. Where data are available we find that restoration is largely beneficial to many ecosystem services, with improvements being observed in water quality and ecology. However, the same restoration technique does not always result in the same outcomes in all locations. The difference in response is predominantly due to the spatial and temporal heterogeneity inherent in all blanket peatlands. Peatland practitioners must take this variability into account when designing restoration strategies and monitoring impact...|$|R

Soil loss due to water erosion is a severe threat to the subsistence rainfed agriculture and the national economy of Ethiopia. Agricultural land drainage is widely practiced in the Lake Tana basin to forestall {{the negative effects of}} excess of water on crops. Drainage is increasingly recognized as a major factor, determining the off-site environmental impact. A lack of cooperation between land users upstream for safe <b>drainage</b> and <b>gully</b> protection can lead to severe downstream gully erosion. Though, {{there is a lack of}} knowledge about the on-site impacts of the use of drainage channels. Poor design and obstruction of the drain are a major causes of gully initiation. Overflowing drains wash out surrounding plots and enhance gully development. Two months of fieldwork have resulted in a detailed mapping of 11 catchments with different farming systems. This study focus on the impacts of these farming systems on hydrological processes (runoff response, infiltration, gully development, etc.), with a special focus on drainage as an initiation factor. The selected catchments have been monitored with regard to vegetal status, rill formation and by putting fixed monitor sticks in the drainage channels. By interviewing the owners of the fields in the catchments information about crop rotation, plowing, reasons of drainage channel construction… has been gathered. The runoff response has been measured at the outlet of the 11 catchments by routine flow depth measurement and the construction of rating curves by velocity measurements.

Drainage network {{development}} in the Keanak?ko?i tephra, K?lauea Volcano, Hawai?i: Implications for fluvial erosion and valley network formation on early Mars. Journal of Geophysical Research - Planets, 117 (E 8). A {{number of studies have}} attempted to characterize Martian valley and channel networks. To date, however, little {{attention has been paid to}} the role of lithology, which could influence the rate of incision, morphology, and hydrology as well as the characteristics of transported materials. Here, we present an analysis of the physical and hydrologic characteristics of <b>drainage</b> networks (<b>gullies</b> and channels) that have incised the Keanak?ko?i tephra, a basaltic pyroclastic deposit that occurs mainly in the summit area of K?lauea Volcano and in the adjoining Ka?? Desert, Hawai?i. The Keanak?ko?i tephra is up to ? 10 m meters thick and largely devoid of vegetation, making it a good analog for the Martian surface. Although the scales are different, the Keanak?ko?i drainage networks suggest that several typical morphologic characteristics of Martian valley networks may be controlled by lithology in combination with ephemeral flood characteristics. Many gully headwalls and knickpoints within the drainage networks are amphitheater shaped, which results from strong-over-weak stratigraphy. Beds of fine ash, commonly bearing accretionary lapilli (pisolites), are more resistant to erosion than the interbedded, coarser weakly consolidated and friable tephra layers. Because the banks of the gullies and channels are easily eroded widths vary downslope, similar to Martian valley networks that have been characterized as ?degraded. ? The floors of the gullies and channels tend to be low-relief with few prominent bed forms, reflecting the large proportion of sediment transported as bed load in high-energy but short-lived flood events. We calculate that the average flow velocities within the drainage networks are typically 1 m/ 24 h. Given some recent modeling of the early Martian climate, our observations imply that rainfall on early Mars could also be associated with large intense events and that Martian valley network formation may be related to similar cyclonic storms.

40|$|Abstract In {{order to}} {{understand}} heterogeneity distribution of hydraulic properties, many studies have proposed models of coarse, braided river deposits. However, they often focus either on the surface/near surface or on ancient deposit analysis. Furthermore, the link between morphological (surface) and sedimentological (outcrops) information has not been fully explored yet. This publication aims to characterize the morphodynamics of a braided, gravel-bed reach of the Tagliamento River (NE Italy) and to assess {{its relationship with the}} subsurface heterogeneity. The morphological analysis is based on a LiDAR-derived DEM, aerial and satellite photographs from 1998 to 2011, as well as field observations. A water-stage time series allows the morphological changes {{to be related to the}} discharge dynamics. The sedimentological knowledge on coarse, braided deposits was mainly gained from the observation of analog Pleistocene coarse deposits in Switzerland. The main geomorphological elements are identified in terms of their topographic signature and genesis, setting apart the trichotomy waterâ€“vegetationâ€“bar. The braidplain is characterized by higher-lying zones with dentritic <b>gully</b> <b>drainage</b> networks and active zones where most of the morphology reworking occurs. Furthermore, two morphologies mark the active zones: a low-discharge morphology (low-discharge incisions and channels, slip-face lobes, etc.) superimposed on a high-discharge morphology (gravel sheets, scours, etc.). Each morphological element is related to a depositional (i. e., sedimentological) element whose preservation potential in the subsurface is assessed as a function of the river-bed aggradation dynamic. The settings that impact the subsurface flow in terms of fast pathway and connectivity are addressed...|$|R

Gully erosion {{is a major}} process {{contributing}} to soil degradation on cultivated areas. Its effects are especially intense in farms under conventional agriculture characterised {{by the use of}} heavy machinery for land levelling and herbicides leading to the depletion of natural vegetation in valley locations. When the soil (e. g. vertic soils) and parent material conditions (e. g. soft erodible marls) are favourable to incision, gully features may present large dimensions, producing the loss of significant proportions of productive land. This study evaluates the evolution of several gully networks located in Córdoba (Spain) within the Campiña area (a rolling landscape on Miocene marls) with conventional agriculture and gully filling operations as the predominant farm practices. The area of the catchments ranged from 10 to 100 ha, they were covered by field crops (mostly bean, sunflower and wheat) on vertic soils. Firstly, we carried out a historical analysis of the gully development during the last six decades by aerial image interpretation. Secondly, a number of field surveys were conducted to characterise the evolution of the gully morphology in a period of five years (2010 - 2014). For this purpose, a range of measurement techniques were used: pole and tape, differential GPS and 3 D photo-reconstruction. Finally, the influence of topography (slope and <b>drainage</b> area) on <b>gully</b> dimensions along the longitudinal profile was assessed. N...|$|R
40|$|Roadside gully pots are an {{important}} component of urban drainage, with over 17 million examples in service throughout England and Wales. Their main purpose is to retain sediments from road runoff, leaves and organic litter in order to avoid blockage or hydraulic restriction of the <b>drainage</b> system. <b>Gully</b> pots require regular mechanical cleaning to prevent blockages; indeed, blocked gullies were partially blamed for exacerbating flooding in the city of Kingston upon Hull in 2007. The rate at which mechanical cleaning and emptying of individual gully pots is required depends in part on the decomposition rate of the waste contained within. However, the physical and chemical processes which dominate decomposition processes are poorly understood. Understanding these internal processes, and whether climate and catchment area have the potential to affect them, is {{an important}} factor in developing sustainable solutions for managing gully pots, thus reducing the likelihood of future blockages. In order to establish a basic understanding of internal gully pot processes, waste was collected from a range of catchment areas and across different seasons. This allowed temporal and spatial variability to be assessed. Model gully pots were then set up under laboratory condition to monitor the effects of moisture and temperature in situ over a six month period. Additionally, the effect of substrate addition, including glucose, Tween 80 and itaconic acid, was assessed within these model gully pots. A composting trial was also executed under mesophilic and thermophilic conditions assessing the effect of a substrate addition (starch) on the waste. In order to assess the processes within the waste, the organic matter content, moisture content and pH were all measured throughout the study. The effects of these variables on the microbial community were assessed using Biolog EcoPlatesTM, along with the assessment of enzyme activity using a fluorogenic approach. Seasonality has little influence upon the waste, whereas geographical location exhibits a stronger influence. This can be attributed to the variable levels of foliage in the areas. Under laboratory conditions the waste was significantly affected by temperature, showing greater degradation at higher temperatures. Varying moisture levels, however, had little to no effect. Furthermore, slight increases in degradation were observed upon the addition of a substrate to the waste; this increase varied not only with the choice of substrate, but was also temperature dependant. The starch addition to the compost trial confirmed the waste’s ability to compost under both thermophilic and mesophilic conditions. The results demonstrated the gully pot waste was able to decompose at a slow rate under replica field conditions. Using a substrate additive only increased this rate minimally, indicating that it would not be worthwhile for local authorities to use this as a substitute for, or in addition to, manual cleaning. However, the positive confirmation from the composting trial could be valuable when considering sustainable gully pot management in the future...|$|R
40|$|Gully erosion is an {{important}} erosive process in Mediterranean basins. However, the long-term dynamics of gully networks and the variations in sediment production in gullies are not well known. Available studies are often conducted only over a few years, while many gully networks form, grow, and change in response to environmental and land use or management changes over a long period. In order to clarify {{the effect of these}} changes, it is important to analyse the evolution of the gully network with a high temporal resolution. This study aims at analysing gully morphodynamics over a long timescale (1956 – 2013) in a large Mediterranean area in order to quantify gully erosion processes and their contribution to overall sediment dynamics. A gully network of 20  km 2 located in southwestern Spain has been analysed using a sequence of 10 aerial photographs in the period 1956 – 2013. The extension of the gully network both increased and decreased in the study period. <b>Gully</b> <b>drainage</b> density varied between 1. 93  km km− 2 in 1956, a minimum of 1. 37  km km− 2 in 1980, and a maximum of 5. 40  km km− 2 in 2013. The main controlling factor of gully activity appeared to be rainfall. Land use changes were found to have only a secondary effect. A new Monte Carlo-based approach was proposed to reconstruct gully erosion rates from orthophotos. Gully erosion rates were found to be relatively stable between 1956 and 2009, with a mean value of 11. 2  t ha− 1  yr− 1. In the period 2009 – 2011, characterized by severe winter rainfalls, this value increased significantly to 591  t ha− 1  yr− 1. These results show that gully erosion rates are highly variable and that a simple interpolation between the starting and ending dates greatly underestimates gully contribution during certain years, such as, for example, between 2009 and 2011. This illustrates the importance of the methodology applied using a high temporal resolution of orthophotos. This research was funded under research project AGL 2012 - 40128 -C 03 - 02.

40|$|Portion of abstract]: Sediment {{dynamics}} {{are influenced}} by transformed landscape connectivity in catchments worldwide. The upper Thina catchment, an important high rainfall resource in the northern Eastern Cape, South Africa, {{is an example of}} where ongoing subsistence farming on communal land has led to overgrazing and trampling that has initiated large erosive features (e. g. gullies) and river incision. The formation of gullies led to increased hillslope-channel connectivity and the resultant river incision decreased the channel-valley fill connectivity. These two changes in connectivity led to increased sediment export from the catchment that has various down-stream ecological and socio-economic impacts. This study investigates how the change in hillslope-channel and channel-valley fill connectivity has altered the sediment dynamics in the Vuvu catchment, a headwater tributary of the Thina River. A combination of methods were used to assess the changes in hillslope-channel and channel-valley fill connectivity. High resolution aerial images were used to map source features, such as fields, gullies, sheet erosion, landslides, roads and livestock tracks. Topographic and geological characteristics of the source features were extracted using a Geographic Information System. Furthermore, hillslope-channel pathways, such as the natural <b>drainage</b> network, continuous <b>gullies,</b> discontinuous gullies, roads and livestock tracks were mapped and analysed in terms of topographic and geological characteristics. Historic aerial images were assessed to calculate the date the larger gullies began forming. Recent aerial photos and cross sectional surveys of the valley fill were combined to map the various sediment sinks. Particle size and organic content were analysed for flood bench cores and terrace samples. The chronology of the flood benches was determined using unsupported Pb- 210 and Cs- 137 dating, and determined for the terraces using Optically Stimulated Luminescence dating. Quantitative and qualitative sediment tracing approaches, using mineral magnetic properties, were used to trace the origin of suspended sediment (collected during flood events), sediment stored in the flood benches and sediment stored in the terraces. Hydrological monitoring was used to assess the potential to store sediment on flood benches along the valley fill through flood bench inundation frequency. Hydrological and hydraulic modelling extended the measured inundation frequencies to a 73 year period and other cross sections along the valley fill. Furthermore, a future scenario of an increased vegetation cover and reduced hillslope-channel connectivity was assessed in terms of channel-valley fill inundation frequency...|$|R
40|$|The primary {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to complete an experimental programme to better understand the hydraulic performance of typical individual types of gully inlets and systems used in practice by analysing the interaction of flow into and from typical gully systems by determining the head-discharge relationship of each system. Therefore, a full scale laboratory system comprising of a testing platform with an inlet tank and an outlet tank on both ends of the platform has been designed to mimic the hydraulic interaction between the above and below ground <b>drainage</b> system via <b>gully</b> inlets and the designated catchment area. Longitudinal slope was later incorporated onto the initially flat testing platform to represent different road conditions. Tests were completed with the flow in one direction to the gulley (intermediate tests) and from both tanks such that the flow to the gulley is in two directions (terminal tests). Surcharged condition was also tested where two flows were released into the system – a primary flow coming from the primary inlet and a secondary flow coming from an alternative inlet straight into the gully system itself. A gully pot manufactured by Milton Precast with a diameter of 375 mm and 750 mm nominal depth was used for this study and was tested over a range of flowrates of 0 – 50 l/s. Another variable studied was two different longitudinal slopes (SL). Two different types of grates with BS EN 124 loading class of C 250 representing different hydraulic characteristics were also used and were tested for a range of surcharged and non-surcharged flow conditions. The interaction – expressed in terms of head-discharge relationship, was determined for the different gully systems and flow conditions tested. Based on the head-discharge relationship, a range of coefficient of discharge, Cd was established. Cd is known to be a function of many parameters and hence to examine how Cd changes, a dimensional analysis approach has been used. This is followed by a review of the application of different types of equations in an attempt to link the dimensionless terms and hence define a universal equation that describes the performance of the system for a range of conditions. This analysis has resulted in a number of significant findings, which have formed the conclusions to the thesis and may be used to inform the way in which these coefficients are represented in water industry standard software...|$|R
40|$|Field {{surveys in}} the Belgian loess belt {{revealed}} the presence in many forested areas of large, permanent gully systems, {{most of which}} are currently inactive. In cultivated areas, such gullies can only be observed in cross-sectional soil profiles through hollows, as virtually all such large gullies are currently infilled with colluvium. Little is known about the spatial distribution, initiation and temporal evolution of these large, permanent gully systems on loess-derived soils. Therefore, the medium-term evolution of a gully initiated in a cultivated area on loess-derived soils southwest of Leuven (Belgium) in May-June 1986, was studied over 13 years. Two intense rainfall events created this (ephemeral) gully, which was not erased by subsequent tillage. Between June 1986 and the December 1999, eight field surveys were conducted to measure gully dimensions. During two surveys, topographic indices (e. g., slope and drainage area) were also measured. Daily rainfall for the measuring period were obtained from a rainfall station located some 10 km southwest of the gully. Analysis of rainfall data showed that no extreme rainfall event was required to initiate such large (permanent) gullies, as observed in forested areas and through cross-sectional profiles in cultivated fields in the Belgian loess belt. Return periods of the event that caused the gully varied between < 1 year and 25 years, depending on the assumptions used for defining event rain intensity. Once established, length, surface area and volume of the studied gully evolved with time, cumulative rainfall or cumulative runoff, following a negative exponential relation. This accords with observations reported for gullies in Australia and the USA. This study shows that a degressive increase of gully extension, can be largely explained by the evolution of a "slope-drainage area" factor (S X A, which is proportional to stream power) with time. While gully length and gully surface area asymptotically evolve towards a final value, gully volume decreased at a given point in time. From this, it is inferred that sediment deposition will potentially infill the gully {{to such an extent that}} the farmer can drive across it. From this moment on, the combined effect of water and tillage erosion in the <b>gully</b> <b>drainage</b> area, will lead towards rapid infilling. This expected evolution of a gully in cultivated fields accords with observations of large infilled gully systems in cultivated areas in eastern Belgium. The permanent gullies observed under forest are attributed to the fact that after severe gully erosion, this area was reforested or abandoned. Therefore, the sediment source was cut off and the gully was not filled in by sediment deposition. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V All rights reserved. status: publishe...|$|R
