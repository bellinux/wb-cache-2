5|$|Cochrane, by now a Vice Admiral, assumed his {{position}} as Commander-in-Chief of British <b>forces</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> North Atlantic station in April 1814 and ordered the recruitment of a body of Colonial Marines {{as he had done}} six years earlier on Marie Galante. Rear Admiral George Cockburn, Cochrane's second-in-command on the Atlantic coast, implemented Cochrane's order recruiting the second Corps of Colonial Marines. It served as part of the British <b>forces</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> Atlantic and Gulf coasts of the United States during the War of 1812.|$|E

40|$|The {{problem in}} {{first-class}} free end lever (distal extension base) Removable Partial Denture (RPD) is <b>the</b> lever <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> retention point that may harm the abutment tooth {{which has been}} discussed many times, but <b>the</b> amount of <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fulcrum point (rest) <b>on</b> <b>the</b> abutment tooth has never discussed yet. The objective {{of this paper is}} to analyze <b>the</b> amount of <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fulcrum point in the first class lever of lower free end denture <b>on</b> <b>the</b> two dimension static models. The analysis result reveals that <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fulcrum point is bigger than <b>the</b> mastication <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> free end saddle, or <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fulcrum point is equal to the sum of the force of the saddle and <b>the</b> <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> retention point. <b>The</b> <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fulcrum point may cause trauma to the periodontal tissue of the abutment tooth. To decrease <b>the</b> amount of <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> fulcrum point is by mastication force limitation, decreasing the distance between the mastication point and the fulcrum point; and increasing the distance between retention point and fulcrum point. For clinical application, there are many biological variables to be considered...|$|R

5|$|In {{the wake}} of the bombing of Banski dvori of 7 October, Croatian {{authorities}} instructed the ZNG to assault and capture JNA barracks in the Zagreb area if commanders considered it possible.

Consequently, <b>the</b> drawing <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> blank is no longer concentrated at the punch nose but is distributed through the punch nose and microridges. This slows sidewall thinning, preventing the occurrence of cracks.|$|R

5|$|The 3rd Battalion {{had walked}} into a {{prepared}} North Korean ambush, suffering a bombardment of mortar and machine gun fire from prepared and hidden North Korean positions, and almost its entire command group was eliminated within a minute of the first shot being fired. L Company, at the pass, was heavily engaged with the North Korean forces higher on the hill. The company's 1st Platoon sustained a direct assault on its foxholes, with {{two members of the}} company killed by bayonets. L Company was separated {{from the rest of the}} battalion by North Korean forces advancing on its position further up the ridge. K Company attempted to move up to relieve it but was unable to do so. However, the company held in place. Meanwhile, I Company began moving up the hill to provide support. North Korean forces were able to cut the battalion into disorganized groups, with L Company engaging forces in the pass and I Company under attack from <b>forces</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> north ridge behind them. By noon, the North Korean <b>forces</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> higher ground had enveloped the American forces.|$|E

50|$|The {{airfoil shape}} and {{angle of attack}} work {{together}} so that the airfoil exerts a downward <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air as it flows past. According to Newton's third law, the air must then exert an equal and opposite (upward) <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airfoil, which is the lift.|$|R
50|$|The {{air flow}} changes {{direction}} {{as it passes}} the airfoil and follows a path that is curved downward. According to Newton's second law, this change in flow direction requires a downward force applied to the air by the airfoil. Then, according to Newton's third law, the air must exert an upward <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> airfoil. The overall result is that a reaction force, the lift, is generated opposite to the directional change. In {{the case of an}} airplane wing, the wing exerts a downward <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> air and the air exerts an upward <b>force</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> wing.|$|R
5|$|A 3,000-strong Army unit, as well {{as several}} Australian {{warships}} and aircraft from a number of RAAF squadrons participated in the unsuccessful defence of Java when the Japanese invaded the island in March1942. An Army force made up of elements from the 7thDivision also formed part of the American-British-Dutch-Australian Command (ABDACOM) land forces on Java but saw little action before it surrendered at Bandung on 12March after the Dutch <b>forces</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island began to capitulate. Following the conquest of the NEI, the Japanese Navy's main aircraft carrier force raided the Indian Ocean, attacking Ceylon in early April. The two Australian Army brigades stationed at Ceylon {{at the time of the}} raid were placed on alert to repel a potential invasion but did not see action as this did not eventuate.|$|E
5|$|After the 1953 armistice, {{the defense}} of the Korean Demilitarized Zone was handled by the South Korean and American armies. The eastern half of the border was handled by the South Korean Army while I Corps took charge in the west. For the next 18 years, the corps oversaw US <b>forces</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> DMZ, seeing only {{occasional}} incidents with the North Korean army. In 1971, under Nixon's détente policy, the 7th Infantry Division was withdrawn, leaving the 2nd Infantry Division as the only US Army unit in Korea. I Corps remained in Korea as a two-division formation until 1972 when it was reduced to zero strength and was replaced in 1982 by the Third Republic of Korea Army (TROKA).|$|E
5|$|Alarmed by this Spartan naval resurgence, the Athenians {{sent out}} a fleet of 40 triremes under Thrasybulus. He, judging that he could {{accomplish}} more by campaigning where the Spartan fleet was not than by challenging it directly, sailed to the Hellespont. Once there, he won over several major states to the Athenian side and placed a duty on ships sailing past Byzantium, restoring a source of revenue that the Athenians had relied on in the late Peloponnesian War. He then sailed to Lesbos, where, {{with the support of}} the Mytileneans, he defeated the Spartan <b>forces</b> <b>on</b> <b>the</b> island and won over a number of cities. While still on Lesbos, however, Thrasybulus was killed by raiders from the city of Aspendus.|$|E

Convinced that the collapse of the ROK II Corps was merely a small counterattack by the Chinese, Walker ordered the US I and IX Corps to shift eastward in order to cover the ROK II Corps' sector. By that time, however, the US I and IX Corps had already suffered heavy losses from the Chinese counteroffensive at Kujang-dong, Ipsok and Yongsan-dong.|$|E
