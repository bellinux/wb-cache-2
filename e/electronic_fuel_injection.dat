25|$|Starting in 1995, {{the company}} {{introduced}} <b>Electronic</b> <b>Fuel</b> <b>Injection</b> (EFI) {{as an option}} for the 30th anniversary edition Electra Glide. EFI became standard on all Harley-Davidson motorcycles, including Sportsters, upon {{the introduction of the}} 2007 product line.|$|E
25|$|In 1969 {{the larger}} Type 4 (411 and 412) models were introduced. These {{differed}} substantially from previous vehicles, with the notable introduction of monocoque/unibody construction, {{the option of}} a fully automatic transmission, <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> and a sturdier powerplant.|$|E
25|$|Introduced as a {{stand-alone}} model in one body style, the 1957 Rambler Rebel is credited {{for being the}} first factory-produced intermediate-sized high-performance car. This later {{became known as the}} muscle car market segment. It was also to be among the earliest production cars equipped with <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b>|$|E

25|$|Yugo 45 {{derivative}} {{models have}} included the Yugo 55, 60, 65, Koral, Ciao, Tempo, Cabrio, GV, GV Plus, GVX, and GVL. Yugo engines were fitted with a carburetor {{until well into the}} 1980s before fuel-injected models (starting with the Koral 65) were introduced beginning with the GVX-EFI (an <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system), which featured a 1300 cc engine.|$|E
25|$|Petrol-fuelled Range Rovers were {{fitted with}} {{carburettors}} until 1986, {{when they were}} replaced by Lucas <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> improving both performance and fuel economy. The Lucas injection system continued to evolve {{over the next several}} years, culminating in the 1990 to 1995 Lucas 14CUX. Some export markets retained carburettors, with the original Zenith/Stromberg manufactured units being replaced by Skinners Union (SU)-manufactured items.|$|E
25|$|In April 1975, the North American Series II got a {{slightly}} revised set of front bumpers which had rubber over-riders covering {{the full length}} of the bumper with embedded turn signals at each end. In 1975 V12 XJS / XJ12L cars and in 1978 the 4.2 6 cyl. XJ6L North American cars got the addition of Bosch-Lucas <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> in the place of Zenith-Stromberg carburettors.|$|E
50|$|Some latter {{versions}} of this 350 were produced with an analog <b>electronic</b> port <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system, introduced in the Cadillac Seville of 1976.|$|R
5000|$|In 1985, BMW {{introduced}} the 324d, {{which has the}} M21 diesel straight-six engine. The engine has a capacity of , uses <b>electronic</b> (indirect) <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> and produces [...]|$|R
50|$|For the UAZ-3159 'BARS' a new {{range of}} 16-valve ZMZ-406 engine {{has been used}} with <b>electronic</b> {{controlled}} <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> The engine design comprises cast iron cylinder block, two camshafts in the engine head and timing chain.|$|R
25|$|In 1988, {{the diesel}} engine was {{enlarged}} to 1.8L, whilst the entry level 1.1L and 1.3L models were updated with the redesigned HCS {{version of the}} Kent/Valencia family introduced for the Mk III Fiesta. For the same year, a Ford developed <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system replaced the Bosch K-Jetronic fuel injection system in the XR3i and Orion Ghia injection models, and a central point fuel injection system replaced the carburettor on models with the 1.4L engine.|$|E
25|$|In March 1983 the Alfetta {{received}} its last facelift; the exterior was modernised with newly designed bumpers (integrating a front spoiler and extending {{to the wheel}} openings), a new grille, lower body plastic cladding, silver hubcaps and, at the rear, a full width grey plastic fascia supporting rectangular tail lights with ribbed lenses and the number plate. The C-pillar ventilation outlets were moved to {{each side of the}} rear screen. Inside there were a redesigned dashboard and instrumentation, new door panels and the check control panel from the Quadrifoglio Oro on all models. Top of the range models adopted an overhead console, which extended for the full length of the roof and housed three reading spot lamps, a central ceiling light, and controls for the electric windows. Alongside the facelift two new models were introduced: the 2.4 Turbo Diesel, which in most markets gradually replaced the previous 2.0-litre which was instead installed in the marginally smaller Giulietta. There was also a renewed two-liter Quadrifoglio Oro, equipped with <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b> Thanks to the Bosch Motronic integrated <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> and ignition the QO had the same 130PS output of the carburetted 2.0, while developing more torque and being more fuel efficient.|$|E
25|$|All cars must be front-engined and rear-wheel drive. All cars use a 5.0-litre, {{naturally}} aspirated V8-engine with <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> {{capable of producing}} between 460 and 485 kW (620â€“650 bhp). Manufacturers are free to choose between using an engine based on one from their own line up or a generic engine provided by V8 Supercars. Both Ford and Holden use US-based racing engines with pushrod actuated valves and two valves per cylinder. Mercedes, Nissan and Volvo use modified versions of their own engines, with hydraulic-lift valves and four valves per cylinder. All engines are electronically limited to 7,500 rpm and have a compression ratio of 10:1.|$|E
50|$|Historically, underbones {{led the way}} in {{semi-automatic}} transmissions and indicator systems. In other respects, {{the technical}} sophistication of underbones has tended to lag those of larger motorcycles, but they increasingly have similar <b>electronic</b> ignition, <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> etc.|$|R
5000|$|The V6 engine, {{which was}} the same basic unit used in the first {{generation}} Chevrolet S-10, had [...] less than the base four-cylinder, only slightly more torque, and was equipped with a two-barrel carburetor instead of the four-cylinder's <b>electronic</b> TBI <b>fuel</b> <b>injection.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The 425 {{was offered}} in L33 form, with a four-barrel carburetor, {{producing}} [...] at 4000 rpm and 320 lbfft Nm of torque at 2000 rpm, and L35 with <b>electronic</b> port <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> for [...] and 320 lbfft Nm of torque, but peaked at 2400 rpm.|$|R
25|$|Leaded {{gasoline}} was {{the predominant}} type {{available in the}} first years of the Wankel engine's development. Lead is a solid lubricant, and leaded gasoline is designed to reduced the wearing of seal and housings. The first engines had the oil supply calculated with consideration of gasoline's lubricating qualities. As leaded gasoline was being phased out, Wankel engines needed an increased mix of oil in the gasoline to provide lubrication to critical engine parts. Experienced users advise, even in engines with <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection,</b> adding at least 1% of oil directly to gasoline as a safety measure in case the pump supplying oil to combustion chamber related parts failed or sucked in air. A SAE paper by David Garside extensively described Norton's choices of materials and cooling fins.|$|E
500|$|New {{names for}} the trim levels were also introduced, such as Commodore Executive (an SL with air {{conditioning}} and automatic transmission), Commodore Berlina (replacing SL/X) and Calais (replacing SL/E). The 3.3-litre Blue straight-six engine {{was replaced by the}} Black specification, gaining computer-controlled ignition system on the carburettor versions and optional <b>electronic</b> <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> boosting power output to [...] The 5.0-litre V8 engine continued to power high specification variants, but was shrunk from 5044cc to 4987cc in 1985 due to new Group A racing homologation rules. The new unit cut its predecessor's weight by [...] and models were fitted with an upgraded braking system. As high oil prices became a thing of the past, Holden decided to drop the 2.85- six and 4.2-litre V8, while the 1.9-litre four-cylinder was limited to New Zealand.|$|E

50|$|Renix (Renix Electronique) was a {{joint venture}} by Renault and Bendix that {{designed}} and manufactured automobile <b>electronic</b> ignitions, <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> systems, <b>electronic</b> automatic transmission controls, and various engine sensors. Major applications included various Renault and Volvo vehicles. The name became synonymous in the U.S. with the computer and <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> system used on the AMC/Jeep 2.5 L I4 and 4.0 L I6 engines.|$|R
50|$|In Japan, the Toyota Celica used <b>electronic,</b> {{multi-port}} <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> in {{the optional}} 18R-E engine in January 1974. Nissan offered <b>electronic,</b> multi-port <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> in 1975 with the Bosch L-Jetronic system {{used in the}} Nissan L28E engine and installed in the Nissan Fairlady Z, Nissan Cedric, and the Nissan Gloria. Nissan also installed multi-point <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> in the Nissan Y44 V8 engine in the Nissan President. Toyota soon followed with the same technology in 1978 on the 4M-E engine installed in the Toyota Crown, the Toyota Supra, and the Toyota Mark II. In the 1980s, the Isuzu Piazza and the Mitsubishi Starion added <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> as standard equipment, developed separately with both companies history of diesel powered engines. 1981 saw Mazda offer <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> in the Mazda Luce with the Mazda FE engine and, in 1983, Subaru offered <b>fuel</b> <b>injection</b> in the Subaru EA81 engine installed in the Subaru Leone. Honda followed in 1984 with their own system, called PGM-FI in the Honda Accord, and the Honda Vigor using the Honda ES3 engine.|$|R
