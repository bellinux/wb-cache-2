Rafoss (1890–1987) from Stavanger (Kvinesdal). Because his father was {{a gardener}} they had a car, which was rare at the time, and using this they went on skiing in the winter and fishing in the summer. He enjoyed going for long skiing tours in the mountains in Stavanger, when he was young, and several times he crossed Trollgaren in Ryfylke, this marvelous moraine that is appropriate to its name. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> it was formed, and was told by the local farmer that it was really Trolls that had set up the meandering fence of huge boulders, far above the tree line. The curiosity for this natural phenomenon in addition to many others in turn led to his interest for the Ice Age.|$|E

500|$|Paris's Théâtre des Champs-Élysées {{was a new}} structure, {{which had}} opened on 2 April 1913 with a {{programme}} celebrating the works {{of many of the}} leading composers of the day. The theatre's manager, Gabriel Astruc, was determined to house the 1913 Ballets Russes season, and paid Diaghilev the large sum of 25,000 francs per performance, double what he had paid the previous year. [...] The programme for 29 May 1913, as well as the Stravinsky premiere, [...] included Les Sylphides, Weber's Le Spectre de la Rose and Borodin's Polovtsian Dances. Ticket sales for the evening, ticket prices being doubled for a premiere, amounted to 35,000 francs. Final rehearsals were held on the day before the premiere, in the presence of members of the press and assorted invited guests. According to Stravinsky all went peacefully. However, the critic of L'Écho de Paris, Adolphe Boschot, foresaw possible trouble; <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> the public would receive the work, and suggested that they might react badly if they thought they were being mocked.|$|E
500|$|Gabe Graziani of GameSpy {{praised the}} presentation, {{saying that it}} {{contained}} a [...] "stunning amount of graphical flair" [...] {{as well as a}} smooth framerate, and summarised that it updated the PSP titles Wipeout Pure and Wipeout Pulse to HD [...] "magnificently". Jesse Costantino of Game Revolution said that Wipeout HD [...] "joins an elite class of current-gen racers" [...] due to its 1080p visuals and a nearly constant 60 frames per second. Costantino also praised the richly detailed environments of the race tracks, stating that he felt like they [...] "exist in a real world". Frédéric Goyon of Jeuxvideo.com said Wipeout HD was atypically a [...] "high flying achievement" [...] regarding its visuals, and also thought the combined colour choices made it a visually unique racing game. Ryan Davis from Giant Bomb praised the game's transition to HD, stating that <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> the Wipeout series [...] "made do" [...] without 1080p visuals prior to the release of Wipeout HD. In addition, Davis also commended the ship design and [...] "rock solid" [...] framerate. Terry Terrones of GamePro said that the game was visually stunning, but also implied that it was [...] "essentially a pig with lipstick".|$|E
500|$|Like Isler, Entertainment Weekly {{columnist}} Ken Tucker enjoyed Walter's transition [...] "from happy, babbling, 'I love LSD!' licorice-licking Walter to a Walter who {{yelled at}} the others when escaping", calling it [...] "one of the night's great pleasures." [...] Tucker's Entertainment Weekly colleague Jeff Jensen commented {{that he was able}} to [...] "roll" [...] with some of the less plausible plot details (such as a still existing Massive Dynamic) out of praise for guest stars Cusick and Haig, believing they [...] "worked well in this world." [...] Jensen also reserved attention for Noble's scenes, calling them variously [...] "frisky and poignant", [...] "hilarious", and [...] "touching." [...] Lastly, Jensen was happy to find more details about the Observers, but wondered at the lack of the parallel universe's mention. MTV's Alex Zalben was more critical. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> the episode fit into the rest of the season, and wrote [...] "It’s a curious step, and could likely drive even more viewers away from a show that can’t afford to lose them." [...] While disliking the [...] "clunky, explainy" [...] dialogue, Zalben still commented that, [...] "for a die hard FRINGE fan like myself, this episode was crack. Huge emotion, crazy science, and epic set pieces. The end of the episode had me dying to watch the next one, even if it isn’t a direct continuation. That’s good television right there." ...|$|E

500|$|With {{the film}} {{seemingly}} continuing plot threads first introduced in Age of Ultron, Mendelson wondered [...] "to {{what extent the}} whole 'Consequences galore!' narrative of Civil War will improve Age of Ultron. As much great stuff as that movie has ... the main hero foolishly/recklessly [...] a world-killing threat to Earth and lots of really bad stuff goes down and yet {{no one seems to}} care at the end ... What does it mean if Civil War does retroactively improve Age of Ultron? Will we be at a point where we really can’t judge a franchise installment on its own merits because a future installment may well fix the flaws a couple years down the line?" [...] McMillan continued some of Mendelson's thinking, feeling that Marvel was [...] "in an awkward place with Civil War" [...] regarding superhero destruction moving forward. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> superhero oversight would [...] "actually prevent the kind of destruction that it's meant to stop ... unless the bad guys all agree to play by the new rules" [...] as well. [...] "Worse still ... the destruction caused by superhero fights [...] foremost in viewers' heads ... the audience won't be able to enjoy the sight of the Hulk smashing a random minion through a wall without thinking of the property damage and/or whoever was standing {{on the other side of}} that wall. After Civil War, can Marvel go back to pretending that everyone is okay after any large scale event ever again?" ...|$|E
500|$|Entertainment Weekly {{in their}} review said that [...] "uneven pacing and tone mar an {{intriguing}} cautionary tale. This collaboration, completed before Clarke's death last March, would've made a better solo project for either author." [...] The Washington Post said that [...] "The Last Theorem {{reads like a}} dog-eared album of favorite themes from yesteryear", referring to Clarke and Pohl topics from the authors' earlier works. Thomas M. Wagner at SF Reviews wrote that [...] "The Last Theorem is a book I really resent not liking, because there's so much about it that deserves to be liked." [...] He said that the first two-thirds is [...] "so good ... it almost, but doesn't quite, {{make up for the}} nonsense that overtakes the whole affair at the climax." [...] Wagner felt that the meeting of [...] "two disparate storytelling sensibilities" [...] was [...] "far less harmonious and compatible" [...] than Clarke and Pohl may have imagined. Wagner summed up by saying that [...] "The Last Theorem is not simply an uneven novel. It's a deeply disjointed one, a book that introduces a host of wonderful ideas and sympathetic, believable characters, only to decide it doesn't trust them to carry off the story in the end, ultimately falling back – disastrously – on dated and dubious formula." [...] Sheila Merritt at SciFi Dimensions said that while it should have been [...] "a fine tribute and a fitting farewell to this master of science fiction", {{it turned out to be}} an [...] "easy book to put down." [...] She said that the plot [...] "meanders in fits and starts" [...] and that the book is too long for the story it tells. Ed Park of the Los Angeles Times enjoyed the first third of the book, but said that for the rest, its [...] "winning and winking self-consciousness evaporates." [...] <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> stable the manuscript was when it was published, and added that it does nothing to [...] "burnish the legacy of either of its authors." ...|$|E
500|$|Producer Jan Harlan {{stated that}} Kubrick [...] "would have applauded" [...] the final film, while Kubrick's widow Christiane also enjoyed A.I. Brian Aldiss admired {{the film as}} well: [...] "I thought what an inventive, intriguing, ingenious, {{involving}} film this was. There are flaws in it and I suppose I might have a personal quibble but it's so long since I wrote it." [...] Of the film's ending, <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> {{it might have been}} had Kubrick directed the film: [...] "That is one of the 'ifs' of film history—at least the ending indicates Spielberg adding some sugar to Kubrick's wine. The actual ending is overly sympathetic and moreover rather overtly engineered by a plot device that does not really bear credence. But it's a brilliant piece of film and of course it's a phenomenon because it contains the energies and talents of two brilliant filmmakers." [...] Richard Corliss heavily praised Spielberg's direction, as well as the cast and visual effects. Roger Ebert gave the film four stars, saying that it was [...] "wonderful and maddening." [...] Leonard Maltin, on the other hand, gives the film two stars out of four in his Movie Guide, writing: [...] " [...] intriguing story draws us in, thanks in part to Osment's exceptional performance, but takes several wrong turns; ultimately, it just doesn't work. Spielberg rewrote the adaptation Stanley Kubrick commissioned of the Brian Aldiss short story 'Super Toys Last All Summer Long'; [...] result is a curious and uncomfortable hybrid of Kubrick and Spielberg sensibilities." [...] However, he calls John Williams' music score [...] "striking". Jonathan Rosenbaum compared A.I. to Solaris (1972), and praised both [...] "Kubrick for proposing that Spielberg direct the project and Spielberg for doing his utmost to respect Kubrick's intentions while making it a profoundly personal work." [...] Film critic Armond White, of the New York Press, praised the film noting that [...] "each part of David’s journey through carnal and sexual universes into the final eschatological devastation becomes as profoundly philosophical and contemplative as anything by cinema’s most thoughtful, speculative artists– Borzage, Ozu, Demy, Tarkovsky." [...] Filmmaker Billy Wilder hailed A.I. as [...] "the most underrated film of the past few years." [...] When British filmmaker Ken Russell saw the film, he wept during the ending.|$|E

2500|$|In general, {{there was}} a lack of vision and serious {{interest}} in the United States concerning the potential of rocketry, especially in Washington. Although the Weather Bureau was interested beginning in 1929 in Goddard's rocket for atmospheric research, the Bureau could not secure governmental funding. Between the World Wars, the Guggenheim Foundation was the main source of funding for Goddard's research. Goddard's liquid-fueled rocket was neglected by his country, according to aerospace historian Eugene Emme, but was noticed and advanced by other nations, especially the Germans. Interestingly, Goddard showed remarkable prescience in 1923 in a letter to the Smithsonian. He knew that the Germans were very interested in rocketry and said he [...] "would not be surprised if the research would become something in the nature of a race" [...] and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> soon the European [...] "theorists" [...] would begin to build rockets.|$|E
2500|$|The {{character}} has also received comments by publications for manga, anime and other media. When Gundam SEED was {{during its first}} episodes in Japan, Ever Cheung from Animefringe wondered about the future regarding Lacus and Kira as he noticed the two about to embrace in the anime's opening theme. He commented if his doubts may be right, he would find the story more interesting that he thought. Kim Wolstenholme from Mania Entertainment liked Lacus's introduction to the series as it added tension to it the friendship between Kira and Athrun. Kim noted that while Lacus and Athrun were engaged, <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>how</b> Lacus and Kira started relating in the series. Ross Liversidge from UK Anime Network stated he did not expect Lacus's faction entrance {{to the war in}} the last episodes from Gundam SEED as it emphasized the disasters happening within the series. Wolstenholme liked how Lacus started to take place in the war as it contrasted her actions in the series' first episodes, while also delivering surprising revelations. Moreover, Chris Beverdige, also writing for Mania, found Lacus' development throughout these episodes interesting {{and at the same time}} comical due to the design of her ship and how it is decorated by the Haros she possesses. While reviewing Gundam SEED Destiny, Liversidge stated that Lacus had become [...] "a cult" [...] within the series' setting due to how besides being pop-idol, she is backed up by a large number of soldiers. Lacus' public appearance in the series to reveal that Meer Campbell was impersonating her and state her true intentions was also called [...] "totally mesmerising" [...] by Liversidge. Chantal Strand was praised for her performance as both Lacus's and Meer's English voice actress by Anime News Network writer Theron Martin for giving them quality distinct from the original Japanese version despite finding it varying at some points.|$|E
