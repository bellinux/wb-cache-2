25|$|In 1866, Georges Leclanché {{invented a}} battery that {{consisted}} of a zinc anode and a manganese dioxide cathode wrapped in a porous material, dipped in a jar of ammonium chloride solution. The manganese dioxide cathode had a little carbon mixed into it as well, which improved conductivity and absorption. It provided a voltage of 1.4 volts. This cell achieved very quick success in telegraphy, signalling and <b>electric</b> <b>bell</b> work.|$|E
25|$|His son, Wellington Stapleton-Cotton, 2nd Viscount Combermere, {{did some}} further {{work on the}} house in the 1870s, but the family's {{fortunes}} declined in the later 19th century. The second Viscount twice rented the abbey to the Empress Elisabeth of Austria in 1881 and 1882. A total of £10,000-worth of alterations were made for her stays, including installing hot water and an <b>electric</b> <b>bell</b> system; the costs were met by the Emperor. A keen huntswoman, the Empress's 80-strong retinue included 25 grooms, and she hunted frequently with the Cheshire Hunt.|$|E
25|$|The {{garden was}} {{surrounded}} by a hedge and high walls, and contained within it three fountains designed by Lockwood de Forest. The two wall fountains were inspired by European and ancient fountains, and both were decorated with palm tiles from the tombs of Syrian saints that Thomas had purchased in Baghdad. Thomas and Mary Garrett were also responsible for the sculptural decoration in the garden, much of which was collected while abroad. These decorative additions included two stone lions from a Mandarin palace in Manchuria, sixteen bronze copies of figurines from Herculaneum, and three hundred yellow and white Murano glass lanterns. An <b>electric</b> <b>bell</b> was also placed in a balkin pine which Thomas would ring for tea or after-dinner coffee.|$|E

50|$|In 1953, Antheil wrote a {{shortened}} (and much tamer) {{version for}} four pianos, four xylophones, two <b>electric</b> <b>bells,</b> two propellers, timpani, glockenspiel, and other percussion. The original orchestration was first realized in 1992 by Maurice Peress.|$|R
5000|$|The first {{commercial}} <b>electric</b> <b>bells</b> {{were used for}} railway signalling, between signal boxes. Complex bell codes were used to indicate the types of train passing between signal boxes, and the destinations to which they should be routed.|$|R
25|$|Marconi, then {{twenty years}} old, began to conduct {{experiments}} in radio waves, building {{much of his}} own equipment in the attic of his home at the Villa Griffone in Pontecchio (now an administrative subdivision of Sasso Marconi), Italy {{with the help of}} his butler Mignani. He built on Hertz's original experiments and, at the suggestion of Righi, began using a coherer, an early detector based on the 1890 findings of French physicist Edouard Branly and used in Lodge's experiments, that changed resistance when exposed to radio waves. In the summer of 1894, he built a storm alarm made up of a battery, a coherer, and an <b>electric</b> <b>bell,</b> which went off when it picked up the radio waves generated by lightning.|$|E
25|$|Battery life (and its synonym battery lifetime) has two {{meanings}} for {{rechargeable batteries}} {{but only one}} for non-chargeables. For rechargeables, it can mean either {{the length of time}} a device can run on a fully charged battery or the number of charge/discharge cycles possible before the cells fail to operate satisfactorily. For a non-rechargeable these two lives are equal since the cells last for only one cycle by definition. (The term shelf life is used to describe how long a battery will retain its performance between manufacture and use.) Available capacity of all batteries drops with decreasing temperature. In contrast to most of today's batteries, the Zamboni pile, invented in 1812, offers a very long service life without refurbishment or recharge, although it supplies current only in the nanoamp range. The Oxford <b>Electric</b> <b>Bell</b> has been ringing almost continuously since 1840 on its original pair of batteries, thought to be Zamboni piles.|$|E
500|$|Just after 8:00am an {{explosion}} {{occurred in the}} west side of the underground workings. It is possible there were two explosions as survivors stated a smaller explosion preceded the main one, although the official report referred only to one. [...] The cause was probably a build-up of firedamp that was ignited by an electric spark from equipment such as <b>electric</b> <b>bell</b> signalling gear. The initial explosion ignited airborne coal dust, and a shock wave ahead of the explosion raised yet more coal dust, which also combusted. Many victims who were not killed immediately by the explosion and fire died from the effects of afterdamp. The explosive wave travelled up the Lancaster shaft to the surface, destroying the headframe; it killed the winder—the man in charge—and badly wounded his deputy.|$|E

The open door reveals the plaster lathing from the wall of an adjacent room and the wiring for <b>electric</b> <b>bells</b> installed on the wall. A series of about 5 buttons beside the door jamb probably ring the bells. The surrounding wall {{is covered with a}} wallpaper decorated with cornucopias, fruits and vegetables. An arts and crafts type of wallpaper runs in a strip around the top of the walls. Some of the panels[?] in the ceiling appear to be in a state of disrepair. There is no cornice. Part of another wood paneled door is visible at right...|$|R
25|$|The Ben-my-Chree had a {{complete}} installation of electric lighting. The twin generating plants were duplicate, each {{being able to}} supply {{every one of the}} 350 fittings which were of 16 candela. A searchlight was situated at the bow and a system of <b>electric</b> <b>bells</b> was also fitted.|$|R
50|$|Among {{his many}} other compositions, he was {{commissioned}} by The General Electric Company, Ltd. (GEC of the UK, not GE of the USA) to write a company March which was performed at their 1904 Annual Dinner.

2500|$|On 9 August 1970, Ontario Lieutenant Governor William Ross Macdonald, {{aided by}} the home's former owner William Burles, officially opened the Henderson House before an invited {{assembly}} of distinguished guests and notables, including Brantford Mayor Richard Beckett, Robert W. Gray of the Maple Leaf Chapter of the Telephone Pioneers of America, Jack E. Skinner of the Bell Canada, Alderman Andrew Donaldson of the Bell Homestead Committee, Don J. Southcott of Northern <b>Electric,</b> <b>Bell</b> Telephone of Canada historian Robert Spencer, and Boston University Professor Robert V. Bruce, who was some two years away from the release of his definitive biography on the younger Bell (titled as Bell: Alexander Graham Bell and The Conquest of Solitude). [...] Bell Historian Robert Spencer provided the assembly with {{a detailed description of}} the three phases of restoration that was then underway at the Homestead.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the time}} the trams were {{extended}} to Skøyen, 1001-1005 and 1021-1023 were equipped with radios. All of the trams had a conductor, which communicated with the driver with <b>electric</b> <b>bells</b> and pulling of a rope. One signal meant [...] "clear", two means [...] "backwards" [...] and three meant [...] "stop".|$|R

It saw extensive usage in telegraphy, signaling, <b>electric</b> <b>bells</b> and similar applications where intermittent current was required and it was desirable that a battery should require little maintenance.|$|R

5000|$|Improvement in Generating <b>Electric</b> Currents <b>Bell</b> patent filed August 1876, issued August 1876 ...|$|R
50|$|<b>Electric</b> <b>bells</b> are {{typically}} designed {{to operate on}} low voltages of from 10 to 24 V AC or DC. Before widespread distribution of <b>electric</b> power, <b>bells</b> were necessarily powered by batteries, either wet-cell or dry-cell type. Bells used in early telephone systems derived current by a magneto generator cranked by the subscriber. In residential applications, a small bell-ringing transformer is usually used to power the doorbell circuit. So that bell circuits {{can be made with}} low-cost wiring methods, bell signal circuits are limited in voltage and power rating. Bells for industrial purposes may operate on other, higher, AC or DC voltages to match plant voltages or available standby battery systems.|$|R
50|$|In {{response}} to the axis invasion of Greece, {{at the end of}} 1940 a KFRE company was sent to Greece to assist with preparations for allied troops, train Greek army officers in demolition techniques, and carry out demolitions themselves.
