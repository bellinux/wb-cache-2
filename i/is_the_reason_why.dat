Disney studios take inspiration {{from some of the}} other studios such as Studio Ghibli and Madhouse because the production team feels that many of the Japan's studios are ahead of them and capable of making better animation, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> they get inspiration from what those studios produce.|$|E
5|$|Between 24 and 25° degrees {{southern}} latitude the Andean Dry Diagonal crosses the Andes. At this latitude, {{half of the}} precipitation falls in summer {{and the other half}} in winter. The formation of this dry diagonal is an effect both of the rainshadow effect of the Andes, air subsidence within South Pacific High, and the cold Humboldt Current off the Pacific coast. This <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the Atacama Desert exists. The extremely arid climate at Llullaillaco is also a consequence of these climatic effects.|$|E
5|$|Equivalent {{residual}} {{times can}} be derived for other inert gases. These calculations are done automatically in personal diving computers, based on the diver's recent diving history, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> personal diving computers should not be shared by divers, and why a diver should not switch computers without a sufficient surface interval (more than 24 hours in most cases, up to 4 days, depending on the tissue model and recent diving history of the user).|$|E

5|$|The {{building}} of Taman Sari commenced {{during the reign}} of Sultan Hamengkubuwono I (1755–1792), the first sultan of the Yogyakarta Sultanate, and was completed by the time of Sultan Hamengkubuwono II. The building site, however, had already been known as a bathing place called Pacethokan Spring since Sunan Amangkurat IV’s reign (1719–1726). According to Kitab Mamana in Yogyakarta Kraton, the project leader for the construction of Taman Sari was Tumenggung Mangundipura. He had travelled twice to Batavia to learn about European architecture, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the architecture of Taman Sari has marks of European style.|$|E

5|$|Initially, BioWare {{denied that}} a PlayStation 3 version {{was in the}} works. Despite this, it was {{reported}} that the Microsoft Windows version of the game featured lines of code referencing the PlayStation 3. BioWare responded that the Unreal Engine 3 is a cross-platform, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> it includes PlayStation 3 code. Eventually, a PlayStation 3 version of Mass Effect 2 was released a year later than the Microsoft Windows and Xbox 360 versions of the game. The PlayStation 3 version uses {{a modified version of the}} Unreal Engine 3 called Mass Effect 3 engine; the same engine BioWare used for the then-upcoming Mass Effect 3. In this newer version, character models were slightly improved and controls were updated to support the PlayStation 3 controller. An option which allowed to switch back to the Xbox 360 controls layout was also added.|$|E

5|$|Terceira {{argued that}} she had a second horse, Chaka III, who should have been used in the injured Navantus' place, was {{regularly}} faster than Nisbett's Antille 8 and should have earned the qualification position. She also accused the Bermuda Equestrian Federation of making the decision based on political or racial motivations, which the organization denied. BEF president Mike Cherry explained that Chaka III did not qualify for the event until June 30, the final day, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the horse was not considered for Bermuda's Olympic slot. The BEF organized a final day of competition between Nisbett's Antille and Terceira's Chaka to give Terceira one last opportunity to qualify for an Olympic position. Nisbett, however, withdrew from the Olympic position later that June. Terceira took his place.|$|E
5|$|Keidai Saeki is a {{high school}} student with {{memories}} of his past life as Sirix Lucretius Fronto, a gladiator in Pompeii who lost his wife Serena in the eruption of Mount Vesuvius in 79 AD. In the present, he is reunited with Loleus, Sirix's male best friend who reincarnated as a girl named Mii Serizawa, and with Serena, who has reincarnated as a male middle school student named Yuuma Ujoh. Keidai has to deal with the feelings he has for Mii and his past love for Serena. As the series progresses, Keidai meets other people who retain memories of Pompeii and discovers that Sirix's guilt in failing to save his friends <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> he retains his memories. When Keidai falls into a coma, he is able to relive the last moments of Pompeii where his actions put Sirix's suffering to rest, allowing him to move on with his life and confess his love to Mii.|$|E
5|$|Silver is {{a rather}} unreactive metal. This is because its filled 4d shell is not very {{effective}} in shielding the electrostatic forces of attraction from the nucleus to the outermost 5s electron, and hence silver is {{near the bottom of}} the electrochemical series (E0(Ag+/Ag) = +0.799V). In group 11, silver has the lowest first ionization energy (showing the instability of the 5s orbital), but has higher second and third ionization energies than copper and gold (showing the stability of the 4d orbitals), so that the chemistry of silver is predominantly that of the +1 oxidation state, reflecting the increasingly limited range of oxidation states along the transition series as the d-orbitals fill and stabilize. Unlike copper, for which the larger hydration energy of Cu2+ as compared to Cu+ <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> the former is the more stable in aqueous solution and solids despite lacking the stable filled d-subshell of the latter, silver is large enough that this factor has a much smaller effect, and furthermore the second ionisation energy of silver is greater than that for copper. Hence, Ag+ is the stable species in aqueous solution and solids, with Ag2+ being much less stable as it oxidizes water.|$|E

5|$|Hitler invited Riefenstahl to {{film the}} 1936 Summer Olympics {{scheduled}} {{to be held in}} Berlin, a film which Riefenstahl claimed had been commissioned by the International Olympic Committee. She visited Greece to take footage of the route of the inaugural torch relay and the games' original site at Olympia, where she was aided by Greek photographer Nelly's. This material became Olympia, a hugely successful film which has since been widely noted for its technical and aesthetic achievements. She {{was one of the first}} filmmakers to use tracking shots in a documentary, placing a camera on rails to follow the athletes' movement. The film is also noted for its slow motion shots. Riefenstahl played with the idea of slow motion, underwater diving shots, extremely high and low shooting angles, panoramic aerial shots, and tracking system shots for allowing fast action. Many of these shots were relatively unheard of at the time, but Leni’s use and augmentation of them set a standard, and <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>reason</b> <b>why</b> they are still used to this day. Riefenstahl's work on Olympia has been cited as a major influence in modern sports photography. Riefenstahl filmed competitors of all races, including African-American Jesse Owens in what later became famous footage.|$|E
