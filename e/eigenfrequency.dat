The <b>eigenfrequencies</b> of the extended matrix arising from a PC formulation govern the convergence of the dynamic response. It is shown that, in the particular case of uncertainties and with Hermite and Legendre polynomials, the PC <b>eigenfrequencies</b> {{are related to the}} roots of the underlying polynomials, which belong to the polynomial chaos set used to derive the polynomial chaos expansion. When Legendre polynomials are used, the PC <b>eigenfrequencies</b> remain in a bounded interval close to the deterministic <b>eigenfrequencies</b> because they are related to the roots of a Legendre polynomial. The higher the PC order, the higher the density of the PC <b>eigenfrequencies</b> close to the bounds of the interval, and this tends to smooth the frequency response quickly. In contrast, when Hermite polynomials are used, the PC <b>eigenfrequencies</b> spread from the deterministic <b>eigenfrequencies</b> (the highest roots of the Hermite polynomials tend to infinity when the order tends to infinity). Consequently, when the PC number increases, the smoothing effect becomes inefficient...|$|R

These calculations rely on realistic physics. Averaged stratifications of the 3 -D simulations are introduced in the 1 -D solar evolution or in the structure models. The <b>eigenfrequencies</b> obtained are compared to those of 1 -D models relying on the usual phenomenologies of convection and to observations of the MDI instrument aboard SoHO.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to {{investigate}} the radiation process of the charged particle passing through an external periodic field in a dispersive medium. In the optical range of spectrum we will consider two cases: first, the source has not <b>eigenfrequency,</b> and second, the source has <b>eigenfrequency.</b> In the first case, when the Cherenkov radiation occurs, the non-zero <b>eigenfrequency</b> produces a paradox for Doppler effect. It is shown that the absence of the <b>eigenfrequency</b> solves the paradox known in the literature. The question whether the process is normal (i. e. hard photons are being radiated under the small angles) or anomalous depends on the law of the medium dispersion. When the source has an <b>eigenfrequency</b> the Doppler effects can be either normal or anomalous. In the X-ray range of the oscillator radiation spectrum we have two photons radiated under the same angle- soft and hard. In this case the radiation obeys to so-called complicated Doppler effect, i. e. in the soft photon region we have anomalous Doppler effect and in the hard photon region we have normal Doppler effect.

40|$|We have {{examined}} the diurnal variation of the local field line <b>eigenfrequency</b> at L ~ 2. 6 using cross-phase analysis of Sub-Auroral Magnetometer Network and Magnetometers Along the Eastern Atlantic Seaboard for Undergraduate Research and Education ground magnetometer array data. On several days the <b>eigenfrequency</b> was remarkably low near the dawn terminator, when {{one end of the}} field line was sunlit and the other end was in darkness. Later in the morning the <b>eigenfrequency</b> gradually increased to the normal daytime value. This type of diurnal <b>eigenfrequency</b> variation was found in both European and American meridians and in several seasons (March, June, and December). By modeling this situation we show that the extraordinarily low <b>eigenfrequency</b> events appeared when the ionospheric Pedersen conductance was strongly asymmetric between both ends of the field line, leading to the formation of quarter-wavelength-mode standing waves that revert to half-wavelength modes as the dawn terminator passes both conjugate points. Ground-based magnetometer measurements of local toroidal field line eigenfrequencies are often inverted to infer plasma mass density in the magnetosphere by assuming half-wavelength-mode standing field line oscillations. However, the mode structure and hence field line <b>eigenfrequency</b> also depend on the ionospheric conductance. In particular, we find that there is a threshold of interhemispheric conductance ratio for the quarter-wavelength mode to be established. Our results therefore show that cross-phase techniques can detect quarter-wavelength-mode waves, where the inferred mass density would be overestimated...|$|E
