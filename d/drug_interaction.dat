5|$|Since {{bupropion}} is metabolized to hydroxybupropion by the CYP2B6 enzyme, {{drug interactions}} with CYP2B6 inhibitors are possible: this includes medications like paroxetine, sertraline, fluoxetine, diazepam, clopidogrel, and orphenadrine. The expected {{result is the}} increase of bupropion and decrease of hydroxybupropion blood concentration. The reverse effect (decrease of bupropion and increase of hydroxybupropion) can be expected with CYP2B6 inducers, such as carbamazepine, clotrimazole, rifampicin, ritonavir, St John's wort, phenobarbital, phenytoin and others. Conversely, because bupropion is itself a strong inhibitor of CYP2D6 (Ki = 21μM), as is its active metabolite, hydroxybupropion (Ki = 13.3μM), it can slow the clearance of other drugs metabolized by this enzyme. As an example, the ratio of dextromethorphan (a drug that is mainly metabolized by CYP2D6) to its major metabolite dextrorphan increased approximately 35-fold when it was administered to people being treated with 300mg/day bupropion, indicative of a major <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> with a common over-the-counter medicine.|$|E

Then was evaluated occurrence of these <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> in pharmacotherapy of community pharmacy patients.

25|$|Supporters of {{the death}} penalty state that the claim that the pancuronium {{prevents}} the thiopental from working, yet is still capable of causing paralysis, is not based on any scientific evidence and is a <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> that has never before been documented for any other drugs.|$|E
25|$|Important drug {{interactions}} are rare. However, {{the most significant}} major <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> concern is the decreased activation of clopidogrel when taken together with omeprazole.

40|$|Background: Older {{people living}} in aged-care {{facilities}} are prescribed more medications than those living in their own homes.

Aim: To determine the prevalence of potentially harmful <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> in long-term residents of aged-care facilities. Method: Potentially harmful <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> were investigated using dispensing data from residents of 26 aged-care facilities who received one or more medications from July 2008 to June 2010. <b>Drug</b> <b>interactions</b> analysed were chosen based on their inclusion at the highest severity rating in at least 3 of 4 international drug information resources. Data were compared to findings from a cohort of Australian veterans. Results: Potentially harmful <b>drug</b> <b>interactions</b> were identified for 6. 1 % of the 3876 residents included in the study. A substantially higher incidence than previously reported in Australian veterans (1. 5 %) and certain overseas populations. Interactions involving warfarin, amiodarone, verapamil, lithium and methotrexate had the highest prevalence in aged-care residents, and generally a higher prevalence than in the Australian veteran population.

25|$|<b>Drug</b> <b>interaction</b> Impact on {{effects of}} alcohol and other drugs: According to several studies in animals, {{oxytocin}} inhibits the development of tolerance to various addictive drugs (opiates, cocaine, alcohol), and reduces withdrawal symptoms. MDMA (ecstasy) may increase feelings of love, empathy, and connection to others by stimulating oxytocin activity primarily via activation of serotonin 5-HT1A receptors, if initial studies in animals apply to humans. The anxiolytic Buspar (buspirone) may produce some of its effects via 5-HT1A receptor-induced oxytocin stimulation as well.|$|E
25|$|Alcohol has an {{additive}} effect {{when combined with}} zopiclone, enhancing the adverse effects including the overdose potential of zopiclone significantly.

Itraconazole has a similar effect on zopiclone pharmacokinetics as erythromycin. The elderly may be particularly sensitive to the erythromycin and itraconazole <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> with zopiclone.

40|$|Abstract Background The {{pharmacotherapeutic}} {{treatment of}} patients with cancer is generally associated with multiple side-effects. <b>Drug</b> <b>interactions</b> and duplicate prescriptions between anti-cancer <b>drugs</b> or <b>interactions</b> with medication to treat comorbidity can reinforce or intensify side-effects.

25|$|During a {{physical}} exam a doctor can {{determine whether the}} tremor occurs primarily during action or at rest. The doctor will also check for tremor symmetry, any sensory loss, weakness or muscle atrophy, or decreased reflexes. A detailed family history may indicate if the tremor is inherited. Blood or urine tests can detect thyroid malfunction, other metabolic causes, and abnormal levels of certain chemicals that can cause tremor. These tests may also help to identify contributing causes, such as <b>drug</b> <b>interaction,</b> chronic alcoholism, or another condition or disease.

25|$|Erythromycin is metabolized by enzymes of the {{cytochrome}} P450 system, in particular, by isozymes of the CYP3A superfamily, CYP3A. The {{activity of}} the CYP3A enzymes can be induced or inhibited by certain drugs (e.g. dexamethasone) which can cause it to affect the metabolism of many different drugs, e.g. erythromycin. If other CYP3A substrates — drugs that are broken down by CYP3A — such as simvastatin (Zocor), lovastatin (Mevacor), or atorvastatin (Lipitor)—are taken concomitantly with erythromycin, levels of the substrates increase, often causing adverse effects. A noted <b>drug</b> <b>interaction</b> involves erythromycin and simvastatin, resulting in increased simvastatin levels {{and the potential for}} rhabdomyolysis. Another group of CYP3A4 substrates are drugs used for migraine such as ergotamine and dihydroergotamine; their adverse effects may be more pronounced if erythromycin is associated.|$|E
25|$|PHRs {{have the}} {{potential}} to help analyze an individual’s health profile and identify health threats and improvement opportunities based on an analysis of <b>drug</b> <b>interaction,</b> current best medical practices, gaps in current medical care plans, and identification of medical errors. Patient illnesses can be tracked in conjunction with healthcare providers and early interventions can be promoted upon encountering deviation of health status. PHRs also make it easier for clinicians to care for their patients by facilitating continuous communication as opposed to episodic. Eliminating communication barriers and allowing documentation flow between patients and clinicians in a timely fashion can save time consumed by face-to-face meetings and telephone communication. Improved communication can also ease the process for patients and caregivers to ask questions, to set up appointments, to request refills and referrals, and to report problems. Additionally, {{in the case of an}} emergency a PHR can quickly provide critical information to proper diagnosis or treatment.|$|E
