The properties of these spray droplets {{can influence the}} effectiveness and risks {{associated with the use}} of pesticides. Initial spray characteristics (initial droplet size and velocity, <b>fan</b> <b>angle</b> and spray liquid density) were therefore measured for a range of hydraulic nozzles and spray mixtures. Particle Image Velocimetry (PIV) was used to measure the spray sheet velocity. There was a significant difference between a standard hydraulic nozzle, Turbo TeeJet® and air induction nozzle for all measured spray characteristics. The standard hydraulic nozzle generated the smallest droplet sizes, the highest velocity and the highest spray liquid density. The air induction nozzle generated the largest droplet size, the slowest velocity and the lowest spray liquid density. The type of air induction nozzle and spray formulation was also found to influence spray characteristics. This work has demonstrated that initial spray characteristics such as droplet size and velocity, liquid density, <b>fan</b> <b>angle</b> and included air can vary depending on nozzle design, operating parameters and spray formulations.

The system methodology consists of a software implementation of the spatial overlap correlator (SSOC) concept in x-ray CT scanners to track the net amplitude and phase of organ motion during the CT data acquisition process. A coherent sinogram synthesis (CSS) method is then used to identify the repeated phases of a periodic organ motion from the {{information provided by the}} SSOC process and hence synthesize a new sinogram with no motion effects.

40|$|Introduction Recently, compressed-sensing based {{algorithms}} {{have enabled}} volume reconstruction from projection images acquired over {{a relatively small}} angle 휃휃 2 ̆ 6 lt; 20 ∘ [1]. These methods yield depth estimation of surgical tools, such as biopsy needles, with respect to anatomical structures. However, they are computationally expensive and time consuming, rendering them unattractive for image-guided interventions. Papalazarou proposed to apply depth estimation algorithms for multi-camera systems on projection data from C-arm X-ray systems [2]. Inspired by this work, we propose an alternative approach for depth estimation of biopsy needles during image-guided interventions, in which we split the problem in two parts (i. e. needle depth estimation and volume reconstruction) and solve them independently. Methodology The proposed system consists of three steps: (1) needle extraction, (2) depth estimation and (3) volume reconstruction. In the first step, we detect the biopsy needle in the projection images and remove it by interpolation. Next, we employ epipolar geometry, see Figure 1, to find point-to-point correspondences in the projection images to triangulate the 3 D position of the needle in the volume. In the last step, we use the filtered projection images to reconstruct the local anatomical structures and indicate {{the position of the}} needle in this volume. We have adjusted the widely used Filtered Backprojection algorithm, such that it fits in the geometrical framework as proposed by Papalazarou [2]. Results For validation of the algorithm, we have recorded a full CT scan (180 ∘ + <b>fan</b> <b>angle)</b> of a phantom with an inserted biopsy needle. Using the full sinogram, a 5123 voxel ground truth volume is constructed. Next, all subsets of two images with angular difference 훿훿훿 of the sinogram are used for evaluation of the proposed algorithm. Finally, the depth estimation error is computed as the average difference between the estimated position of the needle and the position of the needle in the ground truth volume. The average error for different angles is given in Table 1. Conclusions Based on the results of this initial phantom study, we conclude that multiple view geometry offers an attractive alternative to time consuming iterative methods for the depth estimation of surgical tools during C-arm-based image-guided intervention...|$|E

Precise U-Pb isotope dilution thermal ionization mass spectrometry (ID-TIMS) measurements on baddeleyite grains separated from three dykes yield (207) Pb/(206) Pb average ages of 924. 0 +/- 3. 7 Ma (Dashigou dyke), 921. 8 +/- 2. 6 Ma (Yangjiaogou dyke) and 925. 8 +/- 1. 7 Ma (Taohuagou dyke). Baddeleyite grains from a late-stage pegmatite vein in the Dashigou dyke were analyzed by secondary ion mass spectrometry (SIMS) methods. These yield a (207) Pb/(206) Pb average age of 920. 4 +/- 5. 7 Ma. The Dashigou dyke swarm exhibits an overall radiating geometry (the overall <b>fan</b> <b>angle</b> is about 60 degrees), with a focal point located along the southern margin of the eastern NCC, where a large ca. 900 Ma sill swarm was previously recognized. The rift system hosting these slightly younger sills, named the Xu-Huai Rift System, could represent two breakup-parallel arms of a rift-rift-rift triple junction related to the initiation of the magma center that produced the Dashigou dykes. The sills have similar characteristics and could be cogenetic with the Dashigou dykes. The Dashigou dykes are coarse-grained, composed mainly of clinopyroxene and plagioclase feldspar, with or without olivine. One of the most primitive dykes has 47. 79 wt. % SiO(2), 6. 41 wt. % MgO, 1. 38 wt. % TiO(2), 17. 77 wt. % Al(2) O(3), 10. 47 wt. % CaO and 0. 62 wt. % K(2) O. It shows slight enrichment in light rare earth elements and a slightly positive Eu/Eu* anomaly (1. 1), and is slightly depleted in high field-strength elements compared to neighboring elements on a primitive mantle-normalized spidergram. The Dashigou dykes show some similarities with enriched-mid ocean ridge basalts (E-MORB) or ocean island basalts (OIB) and have epsilon Nd(t) values of + 1. 8 to + 3. 1 and (87) Sr/(86) Sr(t) values of 0. 7019 - 0. 7047 (t = 920 Ma). All these characteristics indicate that they are not likely derived from the ancient lithospheric mantle under the NCC, but rather from a mantle source below, in the asthenosphere. This 925900 Ma magmatism represents a second sub-lithospheric mantle upwelling event following the 1780 - 1730 Ma event that occurred shortly (similar to 70 Ma) after the formation of the subcontinental lithospheric mantle (SCLM). Therefore the SCLM of the NCC was multiply metasomatized during asthenospheric upwellings (at least at 1780 - 1730 and 925 - 900 Ma), before most of its eastern part was finally removed during the Mesozoic. Collectively, these similar to 925 Ma dykes and similar to 900 Ma sills constitute a large igneous province (LIP) with an areal extent of about 0. 5 Mkm(2) and a diameter of about 1000 km. This LIP probably resulted from a Neoproterozoic mantle plume centered along the present southern margin of the eastern NCC, and probably resulted in the break-off and rifting away of a separate crustal block. We speculate that this conjugate block could have been the combined Sao Francisco-Congo craton on the basis of precisely matched ages for the Bahia dykes (Sao Francisco craton) and Gangila-Mayumbian volcanic associations (western part of the Congo craton).

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} development and application of a methodology for preliminary analysis of variable pitch fan (VPF), both as a separate component and as a module integrated into a short-medium range geared turbofan engine developed within European FP 7 project ENOVAL. For this purpose, a high bypass ratio two spool geared turbofan engine model was constructed in software PROOSIS. A VPF performance modelling methodology was then developed using 3 D steady RANS CFD produced fan maps as baseline; the CFD maps characterised five discrete <b>fan</b> pitch <b>angle</b> settings. In order to represent those maps in PROOSIS and add the pitch angle as a degree of freedom, they were transformed into the Map Fitting Tool (MFT) reference frame. Once the complete VPF turbofan model was in place, engine mission optimisation experiments were carried out. The resulting performance is characterised by a good capability to control the fan surge margin, without degrading the engine fuel consumption...|$|R
