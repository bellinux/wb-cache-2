50|$|<b>S</b> <b>sets</b> were {{manufactured}} by Comeng and A Goninan & Co. They were Sydney's first stainless steel double deck carriages. Two {{thirds of the}} fleet {{have been replaced by}} Waratahs; however, service expansion will not allow all <b>S</b> <b>sets</b> to be replaced by these trains. The remaining <b>S</b> <b>sets</b> will be replaced by H sets from NSW TrainLink when new Intercity trains are introduced (expected 2019) to replace V sets and allowing some H sets to be reallocated to Sydney Trains suburban services. In June 2014, when the final A set was delivered, the government announced all timetabled services would be airconditioned as <b>S</b> <b>sets</b> were removed from timetabled services and allowing them to operate as standbys. However, a few of the trains operate on all Sector 2 lines. <b>S</b> <b>sets</b> are the only passenger trains still in service in NSW which are not air conditioned.|$|R

An option existed to extend the order, but in March 2013 the government indicated it would not take this up. Instead, in May 2014, the government announced its intention to purchase new trains for the NSW TrainLink intercity network. These new trains are set to commence service in 2019 and will release at least some H sets from intercity services, allowing them to be transferred to Sydney Trains to replace the remaining <b>S</b> <b>sets.</b>|$|R

Su ¢ cient conditions for n. d. <b>s.</b> <b>sets</b> In Section 3. 2 of Lewbel and Tang (2014), we give conditions under which there exists a n. d. <b>s.</b> <b>set</b> for a generic vector of non-excluded regressors x.

This is useful for the identi cation strategy discussed in Section 7. 1 of Lewbel and Tang (2014). Consider a game with N = 2 (with players denoted by 1 and 2) and hi(Dj) = Dj for i = 1; 2 and j = 3 i.
