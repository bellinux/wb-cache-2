40|$|International audienceA {{sensitive}} GC/CI/MS/MS {{method was}} developed for the simultaneous determination of cocaine (COC), anhydroecgonine methylester (cocaine pyrolysis product, AEME), <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methylester</b> (cocaine enzymatic hydrolysis product, EME) and cocaethylene (cocaine with ethanol trans-esterification product, COET) in human hair samples. After acid hydrolysis, hair samples were extracted with an automated solid phase extraction (SPE). The analysis of cocaine and its three metabolites was performed using an ion-trap spectrometer in positive chemical ionization with isobutane as gas reagent. The procedure was validated. Weighted linear regression was found appropriate in a concentration range of 0. 10 - 5. 00 ng/mg for AEME, 0. 05 - 5. 00 ng/mg for COC, EME and COET. The limit of detection was estimated at 0. 005 ng/mg for COC and COET, at 0. 025 ng/mg for EME, and at 0. 050 ng/mg for AEME. Method performance was evaluated in terms of trueness and precision using quality control (QC) samples over the investigated ranges. Method selectivity and robustness were also demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Opiates, cocaine, and {{metabolites}} were quantified by liquid chromatography–mass spectrometry (LC–MS) in 284 urine specimens, collected thrice weekly, {{to monitor}} possible drug relapse in 15 pregnant heroin-dependent women. Opiates were detected in 149 urine specimens (52 %) with limits of quantification (LOQ) of 10 – 50 µg/L. Morphine, morphine- 3 -glucuronide, and/or morphine- 6 -glucuronide were positive in 121 specimens; 6 -acetylmorphine, a biomarker of heroin ingestion, was quantifiable in only 7. No heroin, 6 -acetylcodeine, papaverine, or noscapine were detected. One hundred and sixty-five urine specimens (58 %) from all 15 participants were positive {{for one or}} more cocaine analytes (LOQ 10 – 100 µg/L). <b>Ecgonine</b> <b>methylester</b> (EME) and/or benzoylecgonine were the major cocaine biomarkers in 142.

40|$|International audienceCocaine (COC) {{is one of}} {{the most}} widely used drugs of abuse. Therefore {{numerous}} procedures are published in the literature to propose an analysis of this substance and related compounds in different matrixes. In the same way, the authors have described, in a previous work, the simultaneous analysis of COC and three of its metabolites in hair by gas chromatography-ion-trap tandem mass spectrometry (GC-MS/MS) using chemical ionization with isobutane. The present paper investigated the ability to transfer this convenient existing method for hair to another matrix, in occurrence saliva. The aim of this work was then to verify that the whole procedure (solid phase extraction (SPE) and analytical method) was also convenient to analyse simultaneously COC and three of its metabolites in this matrix. Therefore this sensitive GC-MS/MS method has been studied for the simultaneous analysis of COC, anhydroecgonine methylester (AEME), <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methylester</b> (EME) and cocaethylene (COET) in saliva samples. The method has been validated and its performances were evaluated in terms of trueness and precision using quality control (QC) samples. For quantification, the following ranges were found appropriate: 5 - 500 ng/ml for EME, 2 - 500 ng/ml for COC and COET; AEME could only be determined "semi-quantitatively" between 2 and 200 ng/ml according to our chosen acceptance criteria. Suggested dissociation pathways have also been proposed to interpret the obtained spectra...|$|E
40|$|Today, {{forensic}} hair {{analysis is}} considered to be a standard method for identifying chronic drug users since information about drug use stored and located in hair can cover several months to even years. When interpreting these results, one should be aware of all kind of pitfalls. External factors such as bleaching might influence the analytical result. Although the effect of hydrogen peroxide on cocaine in a solution was described before, it was never investigated whether the described reaction products (<b>ecgonine</b> <b>methylester,</b> benzoylecgonine, hydroxynorcocaine and dihydroxycocaine) are indeed found on contaminated or user hair. Since it is of great importance in forensic hair analysis to know whether cocaine and/or reaction products are detectable in hair after bleaching, matrix-assisted laser desorption/ ionization mass spectrometric imaging (MALDI-MSI) was used to study the effect of hydrogen peroxide treatment on incorporated cocaine in hairs. Cocaine oxidation products were identified in a solution based on MS/MS spectra and spatial distribution of these products in hair was explored using MALDI TOF-MS. All images were accomplished by spraying alpha-Cyano- 4 -hydroxycinnamic acid (CHCA) as a MALDI-matrix. Images revealed a loss of detectability of cocaine and its reaction products in hairs already after a short bleaching period. Since all compounds of interest are found in the hydrogen peroxide and wash solution, these findings indicate that all evidence of cocaine use might be lost after a hair bleaching treatment. Therefore, forensic toxicologists should take into consideration whether hair samples were bleached before making any conclusions from hair analysis results...|$|E
40|$|Aims Cocaine is {{the second}} most-used illicit drug world-wide and its {{consumption}} is increasing significantly, especially in western Europe. Until now, the annual prevalence has been estimated indirectly by means of interviews. A recently introduced and direct nation-wide approach based on measurements of the major urinary excreted metabolite of cocaine, benzoylecgonine, in wastewater is proposed. Design Wastewater samples from 41 wastewater treatment plants (WWTPs) in Belgium, covering approximately 3 700 000 residents, were collected. Each WWTP was sampled on Wednesdays and Sundays during two sampling campaigns in 2007 - 08. Samples were analysed for cocaine (COC) and its metabolites, benzoylecgonine (BE) and <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methylester</b> (EME) by a validated procedure based on liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Concentrations of BE were used to calculate cocaine consumption (g/day per 1000 inhabitants) for each WWTP region and for both sampling campaigns (g/year per 1000 inhabitants). Findings Weekend days showed significantly higher cocaine consumption compared with weekdays. The highest cocaine consumption was observed for WWTPs receiving wastewater from large cities, such as Antwerp, Brussels and Charleroi. Results were extrapolated for the total Belgian population and an estimation of a yearly prevalence of cocaine use was made based on various assumptions. An amount of 1. 88 tonnes (t) per year [standard error (SE) 0. 05 t] cocaine is consumed in Belgium, corresponding to a yearly prevalence of 0. 80 % (SE 0. 02 %) for the Belgian population aged 15 - 64 years. This result is in agreement with an earlier reported estimate of the Belgian prevalence of cocaine use conducted through socio-epidemiological studies (0. 9 % for people aged 15 - 64 years). Conclusions Wastewater analysis is a promising tool to evaluate cocaine consumption at both local and national scale. This rapid and direct estimation of the prevalence of cocaine use in Belgium corresponds with socio-epidemiological data. However, the strategy needs to be refined further to allow a more exact calculation of cocaine consumption from concentrations of BE in wastewater...|$|E
40|$|The {{application}} of Solid-Phase Extraction (SPE) and Supercritical Fluid Extraction (SFE) were evaluated for {{the determination of}} various drugs of abuse analyzed {{in the field of}} forensic toxicology. Three biological matrices (blood, urine and hair) were investigated for the recovery of various commonly abused drugs. The current SPE method used in the routine laboratory was optimized for the extraction of benzodiazepines in whole blood and applied to authentic forensic case samples. The optimized method and the routine method were than compared using authentic forensic samples. Successful methodology developed provided an efficient, less time consuming, reproducible and more robust alternative to the current routine method. The use of SFE was applied to blood and urine samples for the extraction of cocaine and its metabolites, benzoylecgonine and ecgonine methyl ester. The method developed showed that the drugs can be successfully extracted from various biological matrices such as blood and urine with comparable results to SPE methods. Forensic case samples positive for morphine were extracted using SFE and SPE techniques and the results compared. A good correlation was observed between the two methods rendering them compatible for the detection of morphine in whole blood. Hair analysis was investigated using both SPE and SFE techniques. A study was carried out to determine whether a correlation existed between self-report data and hair analysis for five amphetamines (metamphetamine, amphetamine methylene-dioxyamphetamine, methylenedioxyethylamphetamine and methylenedioxymethamphetamine). SPE methods developed proved that all five amphetamines could be extracted from human hair. However, a correlation did not exist between self-report and hair analysis data. Inter-laboratory studies carried out between two laboratories showed that both produced similar results for case samples containing amphetamines. For the extraction of amphetamines (MDA, MDMA and MDEA) and cocaine and its metabolite from hair, developed SFE methods were applied. Amphetamines in hair were successfully extracted from spiked and authentic hair samples thought to contain amphetamines using developed SFE methods. Cocaine and <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methylester</b> were also successfully extracted from spiked human hair...|$|E
40|$|According to {{the present}} Drug Report of Germany, it is apparent, that the {{addiction}} to illicit drugs and pharmaceuticals {{is a major problem}} in western society. Drug abuse was not only result in consequences for the person themselves; there could also be other people affected. Their own children or traffic participants are at risk of drug users. Furthermore, pain killers that are commonly used and easily available over the counter add to an increased risk of side effects. Hair analysis has become a routine technique for the retrospective detection of contact to illicit drugs in driving ability examination or for example {{in the context of a}} custody case. Hair analysis has been proven to be particularly suitable for these tasks due to the long time window of drug detection for up to 6 month. The detection of prior drug intake could also be helpful for therapeutic drug monitoring. Hair samples are often analyzed as part of a postmortem investigation, as their analysis could reveal further information to blood analysis about potential drug addiction. The aim of this research project was to use hair analysis in different fields of application. The first study investigated the correlation between chronic use of non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) and gastrointestinal lesions by analyzing blood and hair samples from postmortem cases. In addition, hair analysis was used for the retrospective detection of illicit drugs in hair samples from parents/caregivers and children. Furthermore, markers of coca chewing are desired for the discrimination between chewing of coca leaves and abuse of cocaine. The two natural coca alkaloids hygrine and cuscohygrine were tested and it could be shown, that they might be suitable markers for this task. By analyzing material of different steps of cocaine production, it was investigated in which steps the two alkaloids are separated from cocaine. A further research project was done to verify the usefulness of nails as an alternative technique to hair analysis. This alternative technique may be used for toxicological investigations in cases where no hair is available. Method validation was performed according to the guidelines of the German Society of Toxicological and Forensic Chemistry (GTFCh) for the detection of NSAID by the use of LC-quadrupole time of flight-MS (LC-QTOF-MS). Corpses with gastrointestinal lesions were selected for the case group (n = 132) and those without any lesions were placed into the control group (n = 136). Blood samples from all cases were analyzed by HPLC-DAD. No significant discrimination between case and control group could be achieved by the blood analysis. In contrast, the hair analysis showed a significant difference between the case and the control group. Out of the case group 76 % were tested positive for one or more NSAIDs while only 38 % of the hair samples from the control group included one or more NSAIDs. Results from blood analysis indicated that most of the deceased with gastrointestinal lesions, which were discovered by autopsy, did not consume NSAIDs near to the time of death. In contrast, hair analysis showed the influence of long-term use of NSAIDs on gastrointestinal lesions in hair samples from postmortem cases. Proton pump inhibitors were rarely detected in hair samples. Rare incorporation into hair may be the reason for this. For the discrimination between traditional chewing of coca leaves and illegal cocaine use two potential markers were established. The aim of this study was to clarify in which steps of the illegal cocaine production hygrine and cuscohygrine are lost. Analyses of the coca leaves, different extraction steps and cocapaste were done by LC-triple quadrupole-MS (LC-QQQ-MS). It could be shown, that hygrine and cuscohygrine are lost in the first steps of the illegal cocaine production due to poor extraction with kerosene. In addition to this, the concentration changes of cocaine, cinnamolycocaine, tropacocaine and <b>ecgonine</b> <b>methylester</b> were also estimated by analyzing the different extraction steps of the cocaine production. Based on these results, hygrine and cuscohygrine fulfill the conditions as markers for coca chewing. Between 2011 and 2014 hair samples from parents/caregivers and children were collected for the detection of the use or ambulatory with illicit drugs. In summary, 388 hair samples from children and 594 hair samples from parents/caregivers were analyzed by GC-MS and LC-MS/MS. Hair samples from children were only tested in case of positive hair samples from the parents/caregivers. The hair samples were for cocaine, methadone, opiates, amphetamines, ecstasy, cannabinoids and benzodiazepines. Cannabinoids were analyzed by GC-MS and all the other drugs by LC-MS/MS. To clarify the cooperation from the parents/caregivers, a follow-up hair tests were done after 6 or 12 month. This study could estimate, that the hair samples of the children often showed a similar or the same drug profile as their parents. Hair analysis of children is a sensitive indicator of the handling of drugs in their environment and to estimate the best interests of the child. Between 2011 - 2014 hair samples from children (n = 296) were tested positive for different illicit drugs, e. g. methadone, heroin, cocaine and delta- 9 -tetrahydrocannabinol (THC). The hair testing of the children revealed no drugs in 80 hair samples. Finally, hair analysis was proven to be a very efficient working instrument for the estimation of the best interests of the child. The usefulness of nails as an alternative technique to hair was tested in two further projects. In the first study, 70 hair and nail samples from postmortem cases were analyzed by LC-QTOF-MS. In the second study hair and nail segments from corpses were analyzed by LC-QQQ-MS after method validation according to the GTFCh guidelines. The extraction of hair and nail samples was done for 2 x 18 hours. Deceased with a promising case history, e. g. known drug addiction were selected for this work. The samples were measured in auto MS/MS mode for the qualitative screening by LC-QTOF-MS after the extraction steps. In summary, 89 substances were detected by the general unknown screening. Most frequently detected substances were metoprolol, acetaminophen and metoclopramide in hair and nail samples in the first study. In the second study, nail and hair samples from 7 corpses were segmented and the concentration of drugs were determined by LC-QQQ-MS. Based on the results of this work, concentrations of drugs are not comparable in hair and nail segments. Due to this, concentration ratios of selected analytes and their metabolites were calculated. Similar concentration ratios for MDA/MDMA, EDDP/methadone and bisnortilidine/nortilidine were estimated. Similar concentration ratios may indicate equal incorporation ways into hair and nail matrix. By milling hair and nail samples, concentration loss could be explained. In addition, analyte losses could be observed due to sample preparation. Routinely, hair samples are only cut into small pieces before extraction. Case 5 showed increased concentration of 6 -MAM in milled hair sample in contrast to the hair sample, which further research is needed concerning nail sample preparation. Nail analysis was confirmed as a useful retrospective technique for the detection of previous drug intake. The analyses of nail and hair samples showed strong correlation to the case history and the drug incorporation in hair and nail samples seem to be comparable. The qualitative results from the general unknown screening showed only slight differences between hair and nail analysis. Based on the findings from the second study, main mechanisms of drug incorporation into nails may be via blood during the formation of the nail plate by the germinal matrix, via sweat and by external contamination. In conclusion, the results of this research work could show the usefulness of hair analysis for different fields of application. Furthermore, nails could be proven to incorporate substances similar to hair and therefore be used as an alternative technique in the retrospective detection of drug intake in cases where no hair is available...|$|E
