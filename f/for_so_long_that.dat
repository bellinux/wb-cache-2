25|$|Chewing gum {{is rather}} shelf stable {{because of its}} {{non-reactive}} nature and low moisture content. The water activity of chewing gum ranges from 0.40-0.65. The moisture content of chewing gum ranges from 3-6%. In fact, chewing gum retains its quality <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that,</b> in most countries, it is not {{required by law to}} be labeled with an expiration date. If chewing gum remains in a stable environment, over time the gum may become brittle or lose some of its flavor, but it will never be unsafe to eat. If chewing gum is exposed to moisture, over time water migration may occur, making the gum soggy. In lollipops with a gum center, water migration can lead {{to the end of the}} product’s shelf life, causing the exterior hard candy shell to soften and the interior gum center to harden.|$|E
25|$|There {{had been}} rumours after the Broadway meeting of January 1648, that Levellers were conspiring with Royalists to {{overthrow}} the new republic. During the Oxford mutiny this was confirmed when Parliament acquired {{a letter from a}} Royalist prisoner in the Tower of London to Lord Cottington, an advisor in exile with Charles II in France, which suggested that the Royalists should finance the Levellers, as a method by which Charles could be restored to the throne. Armed with this evidence parliament published a long declaration against the Levellers and passed a motion to try Lilburne for high treason, using a court similar to that which had tried Charles I. Like the trial of the King sentence would be passed by appointed commissioners (forty for Lilburne's trial), but unlike the King (who had no peers) a jury of 12 would decide on Lilburne's guilt or innocence. The trial took place in the London Guildhall. It started on 24 October 1649, and lasted two days. When the jury found him not guilty, the public shouted their approval so loudly and <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> it was another half an hour before the proceedings could be formally closed.|$|E

The reasons for the lack of a production order by either Italy or Germany remain obscure and a matter of debate. Reasons given by various sources include a supposed overreliance on the use of materials in the Ca.331s construction that may have been in scarce supply (although this itself is controversial) in wartime Italy and Germany; the use of too many parts in the Ca.331, uncommon with other Italian aircraft (although {{it is not clear what}} specifically these may have been); political problems that Caproni company founder Gianni Caproni (1886–1957) may have had with the Italian Fascist government (which have not been identified clearly); an unwillingness of the Italian military to cooperate too closely with their German counterparts for fear of being dominated by Germany in the event of a German victory in World War II; or simply that the Ca.331 was under development <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>long</b> <b>that</b> the requirement for it disappeared before it could enter production, a common problem in the Italian aircraft industry during the World War II years.|$|E

25|$|Ichthyosaurs were carnivorous. Ichthyosaurs ranged {{so widely}} in size, and survived <b>for</b> <b>so</b> <b>long,</b> <b>that</b> {{they are likely}} to have had a wide range of prey. Species with pointed snouts were adapted to grab smaller animals. McGowan speculated that forms with {{protruding}} upper jaws, in the Eurhinosauria, would have used their pointy snouts to slash prey, as has been assumed for swordfish. For their food, many of the fish-shaped ichthyosaurs relied heavily on ancient cephalopods called Belemnoidea. They also most likely fed on fish. A few of the larger species had heavy jaws and teeth that indicated they fed on smaller reptiles. The large Triassic form Thalattoarchon had large bladed teeth and was probably a macropredator, capable of killing prey its own size, and Himalayasaurus and several species of Temnodontosaurus also shared adaptations for killing very large prey. These food preferences have been confirmed by coproliths which indeed contain the remains of fishes and cephalopods. Another confirmation is provided by fossilised stomach contents. Buckland in 1835 described the presence in a specimen of a large mass of partly digested fishes, recognisable by their scales. Subsequent research in 1968 determined that these belonged to the fish genus Pholidophorus but also that cephalopod beaks and sucker hooks were present. Such hard food particles apparently were retained by the stomach and regularly regurgitated. Stomach remains can also contain larger animals, including small ichthyosaurs. Carcasses of drowned animals were eaten as well: in 2003 a specimen of Platypterygius longmani was reported having besides fishes and a turtle the bones of a land bird in its stomach.|$|E
