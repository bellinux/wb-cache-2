5|$|A few DNA {{sequences}} in prokaryotes and eukaryotes, {{and more}} in plasmids and viruses, blur the distinction between sense and antisense strands by having overlapping genes. In these cases, some DNA sequences do double duty, encoding one protein when read along one strand, and a second protein when read {{in the opposite direction}} along the other strand. In bacteria, this overlap may be involved in the regulation of gene transcription, while in viruses, overlapping genes increase the amount of <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> encoded within the small viral genome.|$|E

5|$|The pallium is a {{layer of}} gray matter that lies {{on the surface of}} the {{forebrain}} and is the most complex and most recent evolutionary development of the brain as an organ. In reptiles and mammals, it is called the cerebral cortex. Multiple functions involve the pallium, including smell and spatial memory. In mammals, where it becomes so large as to dominate the brain, it takes over functions from many other brain areas. In many mammals, the cerebral cortex consists of folded bulges called gyri that create deep furrows or fissures called sulci. The folds increase the surface area of the cortex and therefore increase the amount of gray matter and the amount of <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> stored and processed.|$|E

25|$|This {{mission was}} the second flight of the TriDAR, a 3D dual-sensing laser camera, {{intended}} for potential use as an autonomous rendezvous and docking sensor.

TriDAR does not rely on any reference markers, such as reflectors, positioned on the target spacecraft. To achieve this, it relies on a laser based 3D sensor and a thermal imager.

The TriDAR tracked the ISS position and orientation from the shuttle during docking, undocking, and flyaround operations.|$|E

500|$|Conditions of {{the human}} {{integumentary}} system constitute {{a broad spectrum of}} diseases, also known as dermatoses, as well as many nonpathologic states (like, in certain circumstances, melanonychia and racquet nails). [...] While {{only a small number of}} skin diseases account for most visits to the physician, thousands of skin conditions have been described. [...] Classification of these conditions often presents many nosological challenges, since underlying etiologies and pathogenetics are often not known. [...] Therefore, most current textbooks present a classification based on location (for example, conditions of the mucous membrane), morphology (chronic blistering conditions), etiology (skin conditions resulting from physical factors), and so on. [...] Clinically, the diagnosis of any particular skin condition is made by gathering pertinent information regarding the presenting skin lesion(s), including the location (such as arms, head, legs), symptoms (pruritus, pain), duration (acute or chronic), arrangement (solitary, generalized, annular, linear), morphology (macules, papules, vesicles), and color (red, blue, brown, black, white, yellow). [...] Diagnosis of many conditions often also requires a skin biopsy which yields histologic <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> correlated with the clinical presentation and any laboratory data.|$|E
500|$|The {{method was}} {{developed}} by Willard Libby in the late 1940s and soon became a standard tool for archaeologists. Libby received the Nobel Prize in Chemistry {{for his work in}} 1960. The radiocarbon dating method is {{based on the fact that}} radiocarbon is constantly being created in the atmosphere by the interaction of cosmic rays with atmospheric nitrogen. The resulting radiocarbon combines with atmospheric oxygen to form radioactive carbon dioxide, which is incorporated into plants by photosynthesis; animals then acquire [...] by eating the plants. When the animal or plant dies, it stops exchanging carbon with its environment, and from that point onwards the amount of [...] it contains begins to decrease as the [...] undergoes radioactive decay. Measuring the amount of [...] in a sample from a dead plant or animal such as a piece of wood or a fragment of bone provides <b>information</b> <b>that</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to calculate when the animal or plant died. The older a sample is, the less [...] there is to be detected, and because the half-life of [...] (the period of time after which half of a given sample will have decayed) is about 5,730 years, the oldest dates that can be reliably measured by this process date to around 50,000 years ago, although special preparation methods occasionally permit accurate analysis of older samples.|$|E
