5000|$|Over time, the envoys in {{the lower}} chamber grew in number and power as they pressed the king for more privileges. The Sejm {{eventually}} became even more active in supporting {{the goals of the}} privileged classes when the King ordered that the landed nobility and their estates (peasants) be drafted into military service. After the Union of Lublin in 1569, the Kingdom of Poland became, through personal union with the Grand Duchy of Lithuania, the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, and thus the Sejm was supplemented with new envoys from among the Lithuanian nobility. This [...] "Commonwealth of Both Nations" [...] ensured that the state of affairs surrounding the three-estates system continued, with the Sejm, Senate and King forming the estates and supreme <b>deliberating</b> <b>body</b> of the state. In the first few decades of the 16th century, the Senate had established its precedence over the Sejm; however, from the mid-1500s onwards, the Sejm became a very powerful representative body of the Szlachta ("middle nobility"). Its chambers reserved the final decisions in legislation, taxation, budget, and treasury matters (including military funding), foreign policy, and the confirment of nobility. The 1573 Warsaw Confederation saw the nobles of the Sejm officially sanction and guarantee religious tolerance in Commonwealth territory, ensuring a refuge for those fleeing the ongoing Reformation and Counter-Reformation wars in Europe. Until the end of the 16th century, unanimity was not required, and the majority-voting process was the most commonly used system for voting. Later, with the rise of the Polish magnates and their increasing power, the unanimity principle was re-introduced with the institution of the nobility's right of liberum veto (Latin: [...] "I freely forbid"). Additionally, if the envoys were unable to reach a unanimous decision within six weeks (the time limit of a single session), deliberations were declared void and all previous acts passed by that Sejm were annulled. From the mid-17th century onward, any objection to a Sejm resolution, by either an envoy or a senator, automatically caused the rejection of other, previously approved resolutions. This was because all resolutions passed by a given session of the Sejm formed a whole resolution, and, as such, was published as the annual [...] "constituent act" [...] of the Sejm, e.g. the [...] "Anno Domini 1667" [...] act. In the 16th century, no single person or small group dared to hold up proceedings, but, from {{the second half of the}} 17th century, the liberum veto was used to virtually paralyze the Sejm, and brought the Commonwealth to the brink of collapse. The liberum veto was finally abolished with the adoption of Poland's 3rd May Constitution in 1791, a piece of legislation which was passed as the [...] "Government Act", and for which the Sejm required four years to propagate and adopt. The constitution's acceptance, and the possible long-term consequences it may have had, is arguably the reason for which the powers of Austria-Hungary, Russia and Prussia then decided to partition the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth, thus putting an end to over 300 years of Polish parliamentary continuity. It is estimated that between 1493 and 1793, a Sejm was held 240 times, the total debate-time sum of which was 44 years.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: It is {{ethically}} {{mandated that}} potential beneficial aspects of low exposure to potentially hazardous material are {{incorporated in the}} risk-benefit balancing procedure. The potential harm done by pollutants does not justify the invocation of a categorical principle. Minimisation of risk is not required if health benefits are also at stake. Society needs to find an informed consent {{on the threshold of}} risk below compensation of goods is legitimate and morally justified. Such a threshold can be defined context-specific but any human action associated with potential health impacts makes such an acceptability judgment- implicitly or explicitly. Incorporating hormesis into risk management forces regulators to make such thresholds explicit. Once as risk is below this threshold all positive and negative impacts are subject to a relative balancing towards reaching a final judgment on acceptability and necessary risk management options. This balancing risk cannot be reduced to body counts: equity issues, context specific circumstances (voluntary or involuntary exposure, for example), avoidance of risks, the nature of vulnerable groups and many other factors need to be taken into account. Such a complex weighing exercise is best performed by an analytic-deliberative process by which the best available knowledge of impacts (including their uncertain ties) is fed into a <b>deliberating</b> <b>body</b> of individuals representing all sides of the debate.

40|$|We {{describe}} the physical {{context of the}} Dinaledi Chamber within the Rising Star cave, South Africa, which contains the fossils of Homo naledi. Approximately 1550 specimens of hominin remains have been recovered from at least 15 individuals, representing {{a small portion of}} the total fossil content. Macro-vertebrate fossils are exclusively H. naledi, and occur within clay-rich sediments derived from in situ weathering, and exogenous clay and silt, which entered the chamber through fractures that prevented passage of coarser-grained material. The chamber was always in the dark zone, and not accessible to non-hominins. Bone taphonomy indicates that hominin individuals reached the chamber complete, with disarticulation occurring during/after deposition. Hominins accumulated over time as older laminated mudstone units and sediment along the cave floor were eroded.

40|$|Assumptions and aims: In {{recent years}} we have been observing an {{increasing}} number of adolescent patients exhibiting autoaggressive behaviour. These are often direct self-mutilations, defined as <b>deliberate</b> <b>body</b> injuries. The intention of such behaviours is physical self-injuring to reduce mental pain, relieve emotional tension and anxiety. This is accompanied by the sense of being “rewarded”. The study is aimed at analysing the correlation between the severity of general hostility and its respective subscales assessed by the Buss-Durkee Inventory on Moods and humours and the occurrence of selfmutilations in a group of adolescents with superficial self-mutilations. Material and methods: The examined population consisted of 67 persons aged 14 - 18 years, of both genders. Qualified to the examined group were 42 adolescent patients exhibiting autoaggressive behaviour. The control group consisted of 25 persons selected according to age and gender who did not exhibit such behaviours. Excluded from the study were subjects with depressive, psychotic disorders as well as significant somatic disorders, and those who used psychotropic drugs and psychoactive substances. The respondents completed the Buss-Durkee Inventory assessing the level of general hostility and its seven subscales: direct aggressiveness consisting of physical and verbal aggressiveness, indirect aggressiveness, resentment, negativism, suspiciousness and irritability. A separate scale assessed the sense of guilt. Conclusions: 1) Self-mutilations in the examined group were associated with severity of aggressiveness directed outwards (measured both by its general level and in respective subscales). 2) Self-mutilating patients require therapeutic measures (psychotherapeutic and pharmacological) aimed at reduction not only of autoaggression but also aggression directed outwards...|$|R

Method: This was a retrospective audit of medical and psychological management of a cluster of 12 DFBI incidents over 9 months in 4 young female patients with Bor-derline Personality Disorder (BPD). Results: All four patients knew one another from outpatient psychotherapy programmes. DFBI was associated with substance use in 5 / 12 incidents, and with precipitants (experiencing strong emotions, witnessing self-harm) in 4 / 12 incidents. Most DFBI involved sharp objects (razor blades, glass, safety pins). Medical intervention was initially active (endoscopy/surgery) but progressed to a more conservative, observational approach. Psycho-logical management was initially restrictive, but also changed over time to focus on identifying distress, enhancing coping mechanisms and patient responsibility. Co-ordination of patient care management involved intensive liaison (provision of interdisciplinary support and education) between medical, surgical and psychiatric teams.

Participation {{in physical activity}} {{was used as the}} case study. There were two frameworks used to shape the research. Because of their perceived influence on the health beliefs and practices of Hong Kong Chinese people, the traditional Chinese philosophies of Confucianism, Taoism, and Buddhism provided the philosophical framework. The Theory of Planned Behaviour provided a theoretical framework for understanding the target group's preventive health behaviour. Data was collected by means of in-depth interviews, participant observation and case study. Twenty-two informants were interviewed, their transcripts analysed, summarised and typologised, identifying six states of physical activity participation. Findings demonstrated that this target group possessed a holistic view of health, with food taking a special role in preventive care and self-treatment at times of illness. The Cantonese terms used to denote “physical activity” caused confusion among the target group. Most interpreted it as meaning <b>deliberate</b> planned <b>body</b> movement, strength-enhancing activities or exercise, although some did see it as including mundane daily activities and chores. Lack of time, no interest and laziness were reported as the main reasons for low participation in deliberate planned physical activity. Cultural, social and environmental determinants were the intrinsic and extrinsic factors influencing attitudes toward physical activity, as well as perceived social supports and perceived control over physical activity participation barriers. To a large extent, these interactive determinants of health were rooted in the three traditional Chinese philosophies mentioned above. The thesis concludes by arguing that rather than simply advocating activities designed for other populations, health promotion strategies and education need to create links to the traditions of this target group and also clarify their conception of physical activity...|$|R
