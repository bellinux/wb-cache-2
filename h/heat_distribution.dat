5|$|The {{preferred}} polarity of the SMAW system depends primarily {{upon the}} electrode being {{used and the}} desired properties of the weld. Direct current with a negatively charged electrode (DCEN) causes heat to build up on the electrode, increasing the electrode melting rate and decreasing {{the depth of the}} weld. Reversing the polarity so that the electrode is positively charged (DCEP) and the workpiece is negatively charged increases the weld penetration. With alternating current the polarity changes over 100 times per second, creating an even <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> and providing a balance between electrode melting rate and penetration.|$|E

This vehicle is spherically blunted, 12. 84 deg/ 7 deg biconic with the fore-cone bent upward 7 deg to provide self-trim capability. A straight biconic with the same nose radius and the same half-angles was also tested. The free-stream Reynolds numbers based on model length were equal to about 2 x 10 (5) or 9 x 10 (5). The angle of attack, referenced to the aft-cone, was varied from 0 deg to 20 deg. <b>Heating</b> <b>distributions</b> predicted with a parabolized Navier-Stokes (PNS) code are compared with the measurements for the present Reynolds numbers and range of angles of attack.

25|$|Solutions of {{the heat}} {{equation}} are characterized by a gradual smoothing of the initial temperature distribution by the flow of heat from warmer to colder areas of an object. Generally, many different states and starting conditions will tend toward the same stable equilibrium. As a consequence, to reverse the solution and conclude something about earlier times or initial conditions from the present <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> is very inaccurate except over the shortest of time periods.|$|E
25|$|Another {{assumption}} is that heat loss from the calorimeter maintains the same relationship with measured temperature as found when calibrating the calorimeter. This assumption ceases to be accurate if the temperature distribution within the cell becomes significantly altered from the condition under which calibration measurements were made. This can happen, for example, if fluid circulation within the cell becomes significantly altered.

The free-stream Reynolds number based on model length varied from 0. 4 to 4. 8 million at Mach 6 and 0. 3 to 1. 3 million at Mach 10. The basic trends in leeward heating are found to be described by a single parameter, the viscous interaction parameter.

25|$|The common medium {{used for}} <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> is water or {{pressurized}} hot water, but steam is also used. The advantage of steam {{is that in}} addition to heating purposes it can be used in industrial processes due to its higher temperature. The disadvantage of steam is a higher heat loss due to the high temperature. Also, the thermal efficiency of cogeneration plants is significantly lower if the cooling medium is high-temperature steam, reducing electric power generation. Heat transfer oils are generally not used for district heating, although they have higher heat capacities than water, as they are expensive and have environmental issues.|$|E
25|$|Cladding is a {{technique}} for fabricating pans {{with a layer of}} efficient heat conducting material, such as copper or aluminum, covered on the cooking surface by a non-reactive material such as stainless steel, and often covered on the exterior aspect of the pan ("dual-clad") as well. Some pans feature a copper or aluminum interface layer that extends over the entire pan rather than just a heat-distributing disk on the base. Generally, the thicker the interface layer, especially in the base of the pan, the more improved the <b>heat</b> <b>distribution.</b> Claims of thermal efficiency improvements are, however, controversial, owing in particular to the limiting and heat-banking effect of stainless steel on thermal flows.|$|E
25|$|Carbon steel {{cookware}} can {{be rolled}} or hammered into relatively thin sheets of dense material, which provides robust strength and improved <b>heat</b> <b>distribution.</b> Carbon steel accommodates high, dry heat for such operations as dry searing. Carbon steel does not conduct heat efficiently, {{but this may}} be an advantage for larger vessels, such as woks and paella pans, where one portion of the pan is intentionally kept at a different temperature than the rest. Like cast iron, carbon steel must be seasoned before use, usually by rubbing a fat or oil on the cooking surface and heating the cookware on the stovetop or in the oven. With proper use and care, seasoning oils polymerize on carbon steel to form a low-tack surface, well-suited to browning, Maillard reactions and easy release of fried foods. Carbon steel will easily rust if not seasoned and should be stored seasoned to avoid rusting. Carbon steel is traditionally used for crêpe and fry pans, as well as woks.|$|E

After reaching orbit, the crew spent time adapting to the zero-gravity environment and preparing the spacecraft for Trans Lunar Injection (TLI), the burn of the third-stage rocket that would propel them to the Moon. In Earth orbit, the crew faced minor technical issues, including a potential problem with the environmental control system and the S-IVB third stage's attitude control system, but eventually resolved or compensated for them as they prepared to depart towards the Moon. After two orbits, the rocket's third stage reignited for just over five minutes, propelling the craft towards the Moon at about [...] Six minutes after the burn of the S-IVB, the Command/Service Module, containing the crew, separated from the rocket and traveled for [...] before turning around and retrieving the Lunar Module from inside the expended rocket stage. The maneuver, known as transposition, went smoothly and the LM was extracted from the S-IVB. Following transposition and docking, the crew noticed the exterior surface of the Lunar Module was giving off particles from a spot where the LM's skin appeared torn or shredded; at one point, Duke estimated they were seeing about five to ten particles per second. The crew entered the Lunar Module through the docking tunnel connecting it with the Command Module to inspect its systems, at which time they did not spot any major issues. Once on course towards the Moon, the crew put the spacecraft into a rotisserie [...] "barbecue" [...] mode in which the craft rotated along its long axis three times per hour to ensure even <b>heat</b> <b>distribution</b> about the spacecraft from the Sun.
