5|$|Contrary {{to popular}} imagery, the {{asteroid}} belt is mostly empty.

Over 200 asteroids are known to be larger than 100km, and a survey in the infrared wavelengths has shown that {{the asteroid belt}} has 0.7–1.7 million asteroids with a diameter of 1km or more. The apparent magnitudes of most of the known asteroids are 11–19, with the median at about 16.|$|E
5|$|The {{final two}} storms {{of the season}} {{impacted}} several areas, with the final storm affecting areas from Cuba to Rhode Island. The third storm caused little or no damage along the Texas coastline with gale-force winds being recorded only along the coast. The last storm caused severe damage along the beaches of the Florida Peninsula, with damages estimated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> along with four fatalities near Tampa. At least $600,000 was lost in damages dealt to the citrus industry and several maritime incidents resulted in over 55 fatalities.|$|E

According to the IUCN 36 species are listed as vulnerable or worse, with ten critically endangered. Procellariids are threatened by introduced species on their breeding grounds, marine fisheries, pollution, exploitation and possibly by climate change.|$|E

5|$|A {{coincidental}} upswing in {{the fortunes}} of several studios was publicly explained by Code proponents such as the Motion Picture Herald as proof positive that the code was working. Another fortunate coincidence for Code supporters was the torrent of famous criminals such as John Dillinger, Baby Face Nelson, and Bonnie and Clyde that were killed by police shortly after the PCA took power. Corpses of the outlaws were shown in newsreels around the country, alongside clips of Al Capone and Machine Gun Kelly in Alcatraz. Among the unarguably positive aspects of the Code being enforced was the money it saved studios in having to edit, cut, and alter films to get approval from the various state boards and censors. The money saved was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions</b> annually. A spate of more wholesome family films featuring performers such as Shirley Temple took off.|$|E
5|$|Dota 2 has a {{widespread}} and active competitive scene, with teams {{from across the}} world playing professionally in various leagues and tournaments. Premium Dota 2 tournaments often have prize pools totaling millions of U.S. dollars, the highest of any eSport. The largest of them is known as The International, which is produced annually by Valve and held at the KeyArena in Seattle. Valve also manages an event format known as the Dota Pro Circuit, which {{are a series of}} tournaments held every year that award qualification points based on results for getting directly invited to The International. For most tournaments, media coverage is done by a selection of on-site staff who provide commentary and analysis for the ongoing matches, similar to traditional sporting events. Broadcasts of professional Dota 2 matches are streamed live over the internet, and sometimes simulcast on television networks, with peak viewership numbers <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions.</b>|$|E
5|$|Less severe {{property}} damage was recorded {{west of the}} storm's track into St. Margarets Bay and Mahone Bay. In addition to Halifax Regional Municipality's urban core, the town of Truro and all of rural Colchester County {{as well as the}} western part of Pictou County experienced {{property damage}} and power outages from falling trees; numerous barns and other agricultural buildings were damaged east of the storm's path, including a replica of the Hector in Pictou Harbour. The severity of property damage in the metropolitan areas of Halifax and Dartmouth of Halifax Regional Municipality initially led some forecasters to believe that Juan was likely a Category3 hurricane; however, the sustained wind reports did not justify that suggestion. Many of the deciduous trees in central Nova Scotia still had leaves, which magnified the effects of wind damage. Overall, the number of damaged trees was estimated to be <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions.</b>|$|E

5|$|Schutzstaffel ("Protection Squadron"; SS) was a {{personal}} protection squad for Hitler created in 1925. Whereas the SA numbered <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions,</b> the SS started {{with less than a}} hundred men. The SS uniform included a black tie and a black cap with a Totenkopf ("death's head") skull and bones symbol on it. After March 1927, the SS had stricter entry requirements than the general SA. Although subordinate to the SA until the summer of 1934, its members behaved as though they were the Nazi Party elite. From January 1929 forward, the SS was commanded by Heinrich Himmler in his capacity as Reichsführer-SS; later in 1936, Himmler was appointed chief of all German police. Within the SS main branches of the Allgemeine SS, SS-Totenkopfverbände and Waffen-SS, there further existed sub-branches, including the RSHA (which had as departments: the SD, Gestapo and the Kripo). After the war, pursuant to the judgments rendered at the Nuremberg trials, as well as many war crimes investigations and trials conducted since then, the SS was judged to be a criminal organization and determined to be responsible for the majority of Nazi war crimes. In particular, it was the primary organisation which carried out the Holocaust.|$|E
5|$|Termite alates only {{leave the}} colony when a nuptial flight takes place. Alate {{males and females}} pair up {{together}} and then land {{in search of a}} suitable place for a colony. A termite king and queen do not mate until they find such a spot. When they do, they excavate a chamber big enough for both, close up the entrance and proceed to mate. After mating, the pair never go outside and spend {{the rest of their lives}} in the nest. Nuptial flight time varies in each species. For example, alates in certain species emerge during the day in summer while others emerge during the winter. The nuptial flight may also begin at dusk, when the alates swarm around areas with lots of lights. The time when nuptial flight begins depends on the environmental conditions, the time of day, moisture, wind speed and precipitation. The number of termites in a colony also varies, with the larger species typically having 100–1,000 individuals. However, some termite colonies, including those with large individuals, can number <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions.</b>|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} {{estimated}} {{to have had a}} maximum population <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>millions.</b> The great auk was hunted on a significant scale for food, eggs, and its down feathers from at least the eighth century. Prior to that, hunting by local natives may be documented from Late Stone Age Scandinavia and eastern North America, as well as from early fifth century Labrador, where the bird seems to have occurred only as stragglers. Early explorers, including Jacques Cartier, and numerous ships attempting to find gold on Baffin Island were not provisioned with food for the journey home, and therefore, used this vulnerable species as both a convenient food source and bait for fishing. Reportedly, some of the later vessels anchored next to a colony and ran out planks to the land. The sailors then herded hundreds of these great auks onto the ships, where they were slaughtered. Some authors have questioned the reports of this hunting method and whether it was successful. Great auk eggs were also a valued food source, as the eggs were {{three times the size of}} a murre's and had a large yolk. These sailors also introduced rats onto the islands, that preyed upon nests.|$|E

5|$|Two {{months before}} its {{official}} release, Dota 2 had reached almost 330,000 concurrent players, {{and held the}} record for the game with the most concurrent users in Steam history, breaking its own record set in March of the same year. Simultaneous with this benchmark, the concurrent number of Dota 2 players in May 2013 outweighed the number of players for the rest of Steam's top ten most-played games combined. Dota 2 was the first game in Steam's history to have over one million concurrent players, doing so in October 2015, and was also the most played game on Steam by concurrent player count for four years, never dropping to second place {{for an extended period of}} time until being surpassed by PlayerUnknown's Battlegrounds in 2017.
