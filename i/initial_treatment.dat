5|$|An {{increasing}} number of infected individuals are found to harbor antibiotic-resistant bacteria. This results in <b>initial</b> <b>treatment</b> failure and requires additional rounds of antibiotic therapy or alternative strategies, such as a quadruple therapy, which adds a bismuth colloid, such as bismuth subsalicylate.

5|$|The {{primary goal}} in {{treatment}} of IIH is {{the prevention of}} visual loss and blindness, as well as symptom control. IIH is treated mainly through the reduction of CSF pressure and, where applicable, weight loss.

5|$|Cholangitis can be life-threatening, and is {{regarded}} as a medical emergency. Characteristic symptoms include yellow discoloration of the skin or whites of the eyes, fever, abdominal pain, and in severe cases, low blood pressure and confusion. <b>Initial</b> <b>treatment</b> is with intravenous fluids and antibiotics, but there is often an underlying problem (such as gallstones or narrowing in the bile duct) for which further tests and treatments may be necessary, usually in the form of endoscopy to relieve obstruction of the bile duct. The word is from Greek chol-, bile + ang-, vessel + -itis, inflammation.|$|E

Reproductive endocrinologists are usually obstetrician/gynecologists with advanced training in reproductive endocrinology and infertility (in North America). These physicians treat reproductive disorders affecting not only women but also men, children, and teens.|$|R
5|$|In adults, the <b>initial</b> <b>treatment</b> for {{paracetamol}} overdose is gastrointestinal decontamination. Paracetamol absorption {{from the}} gastrointestinal tract is complete {{within two hours}} under normal circumstances, so decontamination is most helpful if performed within this timeframe. Gastric lavage, better known as stomach pumping, may be considered if the amount ingested is potentially life-threatening and the procedure can be performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Activated charcoal {{is the most common}} gastrointestinal decontamination procedure as it adsorbs paracetamol, reducing its gastrointestinal absorption. Administering activated charcoal also poses less risk of aspiration than gastric lavage.|$|E
5|$|<b>Initial</b> <b>treatment</b> {{consists}} of discontinuing medications {{which may be}} contributing. In those who are agitated benzodiazepines may be used. If this is not sufficient, a serotonin antagonist such as cyproheptadine may be used. In those with a high body temperature active cooling measures may be needed. The {{number of cases of}} serotonin syndrome that occur each year is unclear. With appropriate treatment the risk of death is less than one percent. The high-profile case of Libby Zion, who is generally accepted to have died from serotonin syndrome, resulted in changes to graduate medical education in New York State.|$|E

5|$|Though {{dopamine}} agonists {{are less}} effective than levodopa at controlling PD motor symptoms, {{they are usually}} effective enough to manage these symptoms {{in the first years}} of treatment. Dyskinesias due to dopamine agonists are rare in younger people who have PD but, along with other complications, become more common with older age at onset. Thus dopamine agonists are the preferred <b>initial</b> <b>treatment</b> for younger onset PD, and levodopa is preferred for older onset PD.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy cannot {{usually be}} cured, but {{medication}} can control seizures effectively in about 70% of cases. Of those with generalized seizures, more than 80% can be well controlled with medications {{while this is}} true in only 50% of people with focal seizures. One predictor of long-term outcome {{is the number of}} seizures that occur in the first six months. Other factors increasing the risk of a poor outcome include little response to the <b>initial</b> <b>treatment,</b> generalized seizures, a family history of epilepsy, psychiatric problems, and waves on the EEG representing generalized epileptiform activity. In the developing world, 75% of people are either untreated or not appropriately treated. In Africa, 90% do not get treatment. This is partly related to appropriate medications not being available or being too expensive.|$|E
5|$|Following For Your Eyes Only, Roger Moore had {{expressed}} a desire to stop playing James Bond. His original contract had been for three films, a requirement fulfilled with The Spy Who Loved Me. Subsequent films had been negotiated on a film-by-film basis. The producers engaged in a semi-public quest for the next actor to play Bond, which would be for Octopussy. However, when Kevin McClory announced his re-working of Thunderball as Never Say Never Again, the producers re-contracted Moore in the belief that an established actor in the role would fare better against McClory's choice of Bond, Sean Connery. Before For Your Eyes Only had been released, Albert Broccoli had asked John Glen to return and direct Octopussy.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: Carcinoid of {{the lung}} is {{considered}} low-grade malignancy, and less invasive treatment may therefore be considered. We analyzed the long-term outcome of <b>initial</b> bronchoscopic <b>treatment</b> {{in patients with}} intraluminal bronchial carcinoids. METHODS: <b>Initial</b> bronchoscopic <b>treatment</b> was applied to improve presurgical condition, to obtain tissue samples for proper histologic classification, and to enable less extensive parenchymal resection. For intraluminal bronchial carcinoid, complete tumor eradication with <b>initial</b> bronchoscopic <b>treatment</b> was attempted. High-resolution computed tomography in addition to bronchoscopy {{was used to determine}} intraluminal versus extraluminal tumor growth. Surgery followed in cases of atypical carcinoid, residue, or recurrence. RESULTS: Seventy-two patients, 43 of them female, have been treated (median age 47 years, range 16 - 80 years). Median follow-up has been 65 months (range 2 - 180 months). Fifty-seven (79 %) had typical carcinoids and 15 (21 %) had atypical carcinoids. <b>Initial</b> bronchoscopic <b>treatment</b> resulted in complete tumor eradication in 33 of 72 cases (46 %), 30 typical and 3 atypical. Thirty-seven of 72 cases (51 %), 11 atypical, required surgery (2 for late detected recurrences). Two patients had metastatic atypical carcinoid, 1 already at referral. Of the 6 deaths, 1 was tumor related. CONCLUSIONS: <b>Initial</b> bronchoscopic <b>treatment</b> is a potentially more tissue-sparing alternative than immediate surgical resection in patients with intraluminal bronchial carcinoids. For successful tumor eradication with <b>initial</b> bronchoscopic <b>treatment</b> in central carcinoids, assessment of intraluminal versus extraluminal growth may be of much more importance than histologic division between typical and atypical carcinoid. Disease-specific mortality is low, and long-term outcome has been excellent. Implementation of <b>initial</b> bronchoscopic <b>treatment</b> had no negative impact on surgical treatment outcom...|$|R

5|$|If {{a seizure}} lasts longer than 5minutes {{or if there}} are more than two {{seizures}} in an hour without a return to a normal level of consciousness between them, it is considered a medical emergency known as status epilepticus. This may require medical help to keep the airway open and protected; a nasopharyngeal airway may be useful for this. At home the recommended initial medication for seizure of a long duration is midazolam placed in the mouth. Diazepam may also be used rectally. In hospital, intravenous lorazepam is preferred. If two doses of benzodiazepines are not effective, other medications such as phenytoin are recommended. Convulsive status epilepticus that does not respond to <b>initial</b> <b>treatment</b> typically requires admission to the intensive care unit and treatment with stronger agents such as thiopentone or propofol.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{cure for}} Parkinson's disease, with {{treatment}} directed at improving symptoms. <b>Initial</b> <b>treatment</b> is typically with the antiparkinson medication levodopa (L-DOPA), with dopamine agonists being used once levodopa becomes less effective. As the disease progresses and neurons continue to be lost, these medications become less effective {{while at the same}} time they produce a complication marked by involuntary writhing movements. Diet and some forms of rehabilitation have shown some effectiveness at improving symptoms. Surgery to place microelectrodes for deep brain stimulation has been used to reduce motor symptoms in severe cases where drugs are ineffective. Evidence for treatments for the non-movement-related symptoms of PD, such as sleep disturbances and emotional problems, is less strong.|$|E
5|$|Various {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the use of anticoagulation to suppress blood clot formation in cerebral venous sinus thrombosis. Before these trials had been conducted, {{there had been a}} concern that small areas of hemorrhage in the brain would bleed further as a result of treatment; the studies showed that this concern was unfounded. Clinical practice guidelines now recommend heparin or low molecular weight heparin in the <b>initial</b> <b>treatment,</b> followed by warfarin, provided there are no other bleeding risks that would make these treatments unsuitable. Some experts discourage the use of anticoagulation if there is extensive hemorrhage; in that case, they recommend repeating the imaging after 7–10days. If the hemorrhage has decreased in size, anticoagulants are started, while no anticoagulants are given if there is no reduction.|$|E

5|$|With treatment, {{symptoms}} {{should improve}} within 36hours. About 50% {{of people will}} recover without treatment {{within a few days}} or weeks. Fluoroquinolones are not recommended as a first treatment. The Infectious Diseases Society of America states this due to the concern of generating resistance to this class of medication. Amoxicillin-clavulanate appears less effective than other options. Despite this precaution, some resistance has developed to all of these medications related to their widespread use. Trimethoprim alone is deemed to be equivalent to TMP/SMX in some countries. For simple UTIs, children often respond to a three-day course of antibiotics. Women with recurrent simple UTIs may benefit from self-treatment upon occurrence of symptoms with medical follow-up only if the <b>initial</b> <b>treatment</b> fails.|$|E
5|$|The American Psychiatric Association (APA) {{guidelines}} note that, in general, benzodiazepines {{are well}} tolerated, {{and their use}} for the <b>initial</b> <b>treatment</b> for panic disorder is strongly supported by numerous controlled trials. APA states that there is insufficient evidence to recommend any of the established panic disorder treatments over another. The choice of treatment between benzodiazepines, SSRIs, serotonin–norepinephrine reuptake inhibitors, tricyclic antidepressants, and psychotherapy {{should be based on}} the patient's history, preference, and other individual characteristics. Selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors are likely to be the best choice of pharmacotherapy for many patients with panic disorder, but benzodiazepines are also often used, and some studies suggest that these medications are still used with greater frequency than the SSRIs. One advantage of benzodiazepines is that they alleviate the anxiety symptoms much faster than antidepressants, and therefore may be preferred in patients for whom rapid symptom control is critical. However, this advantage is offset by the possibility of developing benzodiazepine dependence. APA does not recommend benzodiazepines for persons with depressive symptoms or a recent history of substance abuse. The APA guidelines state that, in general, pharmacotherapy of panic disorder should be continued for at least a year, and that clinical experience support continuing benzodiazepine treatment to prevent recurrence. Although major concerns about benzodiazepine tolerance and withdrawal have been raised, there is no evidence for significant dose escalation in patients using benzodiazepines long-term. For many such patients stable doses of benzodiazepines retain their efficacy over several years.|$|E
5|$|The most {{important}} <b>initial</b> <b>treatment</b> for ethylene glycol poisoning is stabilizing the patient. As ethylene glycol is rapidly absorbed, gastric decontamination {{is unlikely to}} be of benefit unless it is performed within 60 minutes of ingestion. Traditionally, gastric lavage or nasogastric aspiration of gastric contents are the most common methods employed in ethylene glycol poisoning. The usefulness of gastric lavage has, however, been questioned, and it is now no longer used routinely in poisoning situations. Ipecac-induced vomiting is not recommended. As activated charcoal does not adsorb glycols, it is not recommended as it will not be effective at preventing absorption. It is only used {{in the presence of a}} toxic dose of another poison or drug. Patients with significant poisoning often present in a critical condition. In this situation stabilization of the patient including airway management with intubation should be performed in preference to gastrointestinal decontamination. Patients presenting with metabolic acidosis or seizures require treatment with sodium bicarbonate and anticonvulsives such as a benzodiazepine respectively. Sodium bicarbonate should be used cautiously as it can worsen hypocalcemia by increasing the plasma protein binding of calcium. If hypocalcemia occurs it can be treated with calcium replacement although calcium supplementation can increase the precipitation of calcium oxalate crystals leading to tissue damage. Intubation and respiratory support may be required in severely intoxicated patients; patients with hypotension require treatment with intravenous fluids and possibly vasopressors.|$|E
