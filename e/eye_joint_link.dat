40|$|Abstract. Cognitive radio (CR) is a {{promising}} technology that enables opportunistic {{utilization of the}} temporarily vacant spectrum to mitigate the spectrum scarcity in wire-less communications. Since secondary users (SUs) should vacate the channel in use immediately after detecting the reappearances of primary users (PUs) in cognitive radio networks (CRNs), the route reliability is a distinctive chal-lenge for routing in CRNs. Furthermore, the throughput requirement of an SU session should be satisfied and it is always preferable to select a route with less negative influ-ence on other current or latish sessions. To account for the route reliability challenge, we study the <b>joint</b> <b>link</b> and channel assignment routing problem for CRNs. It is formu-lated in a form of integer nonlinear programming (INLP), which is NP-hard, {{with the objective of}} minimizing the interference of a new route to other routes while providing route reliability and throughput guarantee. An on-demand route discovery algorithm is proposed to find reliable can-didate paths, while a <b>joint</b> <b>link</b> and channel assignment routing algorithm with sequentially-connected-link coor-dination is proposed to choose the near-optimal route for improving the route reliability and minimizing negative influence. Simulation results demonstrate that the proposed algorithm achieves considerable improvement over exist-ing schemes in both route reliability and throughput.

Methods and subjects: This case-control study was performed on 60 cases with diagnosed broken heart syndrome, 60 cases of acute coronary syndrome and 60 healthy subjects. All enrolled participants filed appropriate questionnaires after getting signed informed consent. Data were analyzed using SPSS ver. 12 via MANOVA test.

40|$|A 48 -year-old {{prestressed}} double tee {{girder bridge}} located on Icy Springs road in Coalville, Utah, was tested for live load. The test measured strains, deflections and rotations. The instruments used {{for measuring the}} respective measurements were strain gages, deflectometers (2 ̆ 2 twangers 2 ̆ 2) and tiltmeters. From the recorded measurements a finite element model (FEM) was calibrated to validate the modeling techniques based on the test data. The FEM implemented two <b>joint</b> <b>link</b> elements to connect the flanges of the FEM deck to model the transverse load distribution of the bridge deteriorated shear connectors. The abutment restraints were modeled by one <b>joint</b> <b>link</b> elements. The deck and the stems were modeled using shell element.

The FEM GDF predictions were compared to the prediction proposed by the American Association of State Highway and Transportation Officials (AASHTO) in the provision AASHTO LRFD 2010. The parametric study considered the variable parameters of span length, slab thickness, number of double tees, angle of skew, and stem spacing.
