5|$|In the Time Room, Prismo reveals to Jake that Finn {{has been}} transported to a separate, altered world {{based on his}} wish that The Lich never existed. Together, they watch the events in Finn's world on Prismo's television, and Prismo asks Jake what {{he would like to}} wish for. Jake wishes for a sandwich, but Prismo urges him to {{consider}} using his wish on something important, such as helping Finn. Jake tells Prismo <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> it when he knows Finn will be in real danger, and after a conversation, the two decide to hang out; Prismo mutes the TV and the two begin to ignore the events happening in Finn's timeline.|$|E
5|$|Patrice {{begins the}} show, {{explaining}} that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> memories and objects relating to Rémi to perform. He says that Rémi loved ventriloquism, and performs his own routine with a monkey puppet called Falzouille, {{in which the}} puppet never speaks. He talks about how the puppet is not alive as it has Velcro pads, and imitates a cat and mouse with Velcro on their paws. He tells a story of when he removed the batteries from his colleague's calculator, then takes out Rémi's notebook, which contains the telephone numbers of prostitutes and vomit stains. Patrice performs a shadow puppetry routine in which an Armenian soldier rescues his daughter from 25 duduk players. It becomes clear that Patrice is not actually making the shadows, and he gets annoyed at three stagehands called David.|$|E
5|$|Bribery. Doing {{any one of}} {{a number}} of acts to induce a person to vote or refrain from voting or to reward him for having done so, such as giving or lending money; and giving or {{procuring}} an office or employment, amounts to bribery. It is also bribery for a person to procure or promise to procure that a voter exercise his vote in a certain way or that a candidate be elected as President in return for some inducement; to give money to someone else, knowing that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> the money for bribery at an election; to accept an inducement for voting or not voting or agreeing to do so; and to induce a person to consent to being nominated as a candidate, or refrain or withdraw from being a candidate in return for some inducement. The penalty is a fine of up to $5,000 or imprisonment not exceeding three years or both; and disqualification from being registered as a voter, voting at any election, or being elected to Parliament or the office of President for seven years.|$|E

5|$|Megatron sends Starscream, and {{his twin}} {{brothers}} Thundercracker and Skywarp to reactivate an Energon bridge which will feed the station with raw Energon, allowing the manufacturing of more Dark Energon. Once they succeed, Megatron then develops {{a plan to}} infect the core of Cybertron with Dark Energon, feeling that he can {{gain control of the}} planet once it is infected. He launches a full-scale assault on the Autobot capital city of Iacon, looking for an item called the Omega Key, which <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> to enter Cybertron's core and infect it. The Decepticons learn that Zeta Prime has placed the key under his personal guard. Megatron's forces enter the chambers of Zeta Prime and defeat him in battle. Zeta Prime tells Megatron that the Omega Key is not actually what unlocks access to the core, but is the means to activate the true key, a colossal Transformer known as Omega Supreme. After hearing this, Megatron presumably kills Zeta Prime.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Wee-Bey tells De'londa Brice {{that if she}} {{has thrown}} Namond out then he will stay out of her care. De'Londa claims that {{she is trying to}} harden Namond and Wee-Bey threatens that if she does not let their son go, <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> his {{reputation}} against her. She asks Wee-Bey if he is cutting her off, but he reassures her that their relationship is not over.|$|E
25|$|Simmons tells Duncan that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> the {{breeches}} buoy next, but Duncan punches him, saying the men will draw numbers {{but he and}} his son-in-law will be the last to leave. The fire reaches the Promenade Room and Simmons forces his way onto the buoy, leading to a struggle. Parker is pushed to his death by Simmons. An explosion severs the lines to the {{breeches buoy}}, causing Simmons and others to fall to their deaths.|$|E

He reattaches the levers before he travels further ahead to roughly 30 million years from his own time. There he sees some of the last living things on a dying Earth: menacing reddish crab-like creatures slowly wandering the blood-red beaches chasing enormous butterflies in a world covered in simple lichenous vegetation. He continues to make short jumps through time, seeing Earth's rotation gradually cease and the sun grow larger, redder, and dimmer, and the world falling silent and freezing as the last degenerate living things die out.|$|E
25|$|The two central {{characters}} are the Americans Bremen and Gail. Both are telepaths, {{the only other}} telepaths that either has ever known. Inevitably, they fall in love. When Gail dies of illness, Bremen is devastated. He gives up his career in mathematics and becomes a drifter. At the commencement of the action, he has ended up at a facility for retarded and otherwise disabled minors. He becomes sort of fond of one named Robby, who had been blinded and mentally crippled before birth by his mother's drug abuse habits, and resolves that before he leaves the facility (for he feels he has been there too long), <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> his telepathic power to give Robby a gift of sorts: images and sounds of the outside world.|$|E
25|$|Blake {{worked with}} Prince {{to create a}} new racquet with Prince's O3 technology. However, he did not feel {{comfortable}} with this racquet. So, he switched back to the Dunlop Sport Aerogel 200, then the 4D 200, for the 2009 season. He changed to Wilson {{at the start of the}} 2010 season, using the new Six.One Tour strung with Luxilon Big Banger Alu Power 16L strings at high tension (60+ pounds). He did not feel comfortable with this racquet either. Therefore, he switched back to Dunlop again. After the US Open of 2010, he began to test out rackets for Head. As August 26, 2011, he announced <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> Donnay rackets as his choice and using a customized Donnay X-Dual Pro. His clothing sponsor is Fila, with whom he started working in 2009 after using Nike for most his career. He has his own clothing line named Thomas Reynolds Collection after his father.|$|E

[...] The {{line is a}} reference to Leslie's stylish ex-boyfriend Justin, played by actor Justin Theroux earlier in the season, who Tom desperately admired. When Jerry takes a bad picture for the catalog, he indicates <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> the graphics software Adobe Photoshop to change the image, prompting April to ask, [...] "Can you Photoshop your life with better decisions, Jerry?" ...|$|E
500|$|Written by 'Johannes the Seducer', {{this volume}} {{illustrates}} how the aesthete holds the [...] "interesting" [...] as his highest value and how, to satisfy his voyeuristic reflections, he manipulates {{the girl he}} calls Cordelia from being boring into being interesting - he grooms her {{to fall in love}} with him, but then schemes to have her questioning the idea of engagement. [...] Finally, Johannes succeeds in having Cordelia break the engagement herself. [...] <b>He</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> irony, artifice, caprice, imagination and arbitrariness to engineer poetically satisfying possibilities; he is not so much interested in the act of seduction as in willfully creating its interesting possibility.|$|E
500|$|As with Ladenson's {{observation}} that Bond was being depicted as [...] "the worthy knight", Raymond Benson also identifies the Saint George theme in Goldfinger, {{which he says}} has run in all the novels, but is finally stated explicitly in the book as part of Bond's thoughts after Goldfinger reveals <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> an atomic device to open the vault: [...] "Bond sighed wearily. Once more into the breach, dear friend! This time it really was St George and the dragon. And St. George had better {{get a move on}} and do something".

500|$|Gatiss has criticised recent {{television}} {{adaptations of}} the Conan Doyle stories as [...] "too reverential and too slow", aiming instead {{to be as}} irreverent to the canon as the 1930s and 1940s films starring Basil Rathbone and Nigel Bruce, which were mostly set in the then contemporary interwar era. Benedict Cumberbatch's Sherlock uses modern technology, such as texting, the internet and GPS to solve crimes. Paul McGuigan, who directed two episodes of Sherlock, says that this {{is in keeping with}} Conan Doyle's character, pointing out that [...] "n the books he would use any device possible and he was always in the lab doing experiments. It's just a modern day version of it. <b>He</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> the tools that are available to him today in order to find things out." ...|$|E
500|$|Andy Dufresne (Peter) {{is sent to}} Shawshank Prison, {{though none}} of the inmates think much of him, {{particularly}} Red (Cleveland, who narrates the story). A month passes before Andy literally says two words to Red, and later asks him for a rock hammer, claiming he carves Star Wars figurines out of stone. He also suggests in a poorly veiled manner that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> the hammer to tunnel out of the prison. Andy and Red end up becoming fast friends, and Red provides him with the rock hammer. One day, the prison's stern warden Samuel Norton (Carter) takes a liking to Andy's figurines and offers to sell them so he can take all the money for himself, crippling Bogs (Joe), one of the inmates who had raped Andy in the shower, {{as a sign of}} good will (despite Andy saying that he liked him). Andy is then given permission to clean Norton's office, and, while doing so, plays a record of [...] "Hollaback Girl" [...] across the whole prison, which utterly confuses all the inmates and infuriates Norton, who calls Andy into his office and places him in solitary confinement for two months after Andy indirectly insults him.|$|E
500|$|Ideologically, Varg Vikernes's one-man project Burzum helped {{inspire the}} Viking metal scene through his {{strongly}} held racist, nationalistic, and anti-Judeo-Christian beliefs, and his {{longing for a}} return to paganism. In Trafford and Pluskowski's opinion, Vikernes' beliefs, which had culminated in the burning of several churches, including the twelfth-century Fantoft Stave Church in Bergen, reveal the confused nature of ideas about Vikings in the Norwegian black metal scene. They note, [...] "His tastes seem originally not for the unmediated medieval itself as for J. R. R. Tolkien: he adopted the name 'Count Grishnackh', based upon an orc in The Lord of the Rings, and named Burzum after a Tolkienian word for 'darkness'." [...] They postulate that only in retrospect did Vikernes [...] "cloak his actions in an Oðinic garb and claim the motivation of an attempt to restore Norse paganism for his church burning". While in prison, Vikernes released the book Vargsmål, which Trafford and Pluskowski call an echoing of the Hávamál, though with [...] "an eye on Mein Kampf". According to Trafford and Pluskowski, [...] "proving both that {{it is not just the}} early medieval past to which he looks for inspiration, and that <b>he</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> any historical weapon at his disposal to offend Norwegian liberal opinion, it is notable that he has recently added the name Quisling to his own, and is even attempting to claim some sort of kinship to the wartime collaborator".|$|E

500|$|Adams {{prefers to}} work from a plot rather than from a full script, a result of Ann Nocenti's dense Longshot scripts, though he has worked from a full script, as with his work on Three Dimensional Alien Worlds for Pacific Comics and The Authority. Though he says he prefers group books because they more easily allow him to hide his [...] "bad layout skills", he is {{nonetheless}} comfortable with solo character books. He begins drawing thumbnail layouts from the story he is given, either {{at home or in}} a public place. The thumbnails range in size from 2inches x 3inches to half the size of the printed comic book. He or an assistant will then enlarge the thumbnails and trace them onto illustration board with a non-photo blue pencil, sometimes using a Prismacolor light blue pencil, because it is not too waxy, and erases easily. When working on the final illustration board, he does so on a large drawing board when in his basement studio, and a lapboard when sitting on his living room couch. After tracing the thumbnails, he will then clarify details with another light blue pencil, and finalize the details with a Number 2 pencil. He drew the first three chapters of [...] "Jonni Future" [...] at twice the printed comic size, and also drew the fifth chapter, [...] "The Garden of the Sklin", at a size larger than standard, in order to render more detail than usual in those stories. For a large poster image with a multitude of characters, he will go over the figure outlines with a marker in order to emphasize them. <b>He</b> <b>will</b> <b>use</b> photographic reference when appropriate, as when he draws things that he is not accustomed to.|$|E
