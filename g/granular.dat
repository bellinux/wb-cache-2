5|$|The ASEAN Bintulu Fertiliser {{plant is}} the {{anhydrous}} ammonia and <b>granular</b> plant operated by ASEAN Bintulu Fertiliser Sdn Bhd (ABF), which is partly owned by Petronas. The company was formed on 6 December 1980. The plant started operation on 1 October 1985. It {{is also one}} of the largest <b>granular</b> urea plants in Asia. It is a joint venture by five ASEAN countries: Malaysia (63.5% shares), Thailand (13%), Indonesia (13%), the Philippines (9.5%), and Singapore (1%).|$|E
5|$|To improve {{traction}} and {{melt ice}} or snow, winter service vehicles spread <b>granular</b> or liquid ice melting chemicals and grit, such as sand or gravel.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} colour of {{the cap and}} pores make it hard {{to confuse}} with other species. Often found in similar habitats is S.variegatus, though this species has a <b>granular</b> cap and dark olive pores, which are smaller and not decurrent. It can also bruise blue.|$|E
5|$|The {{upcoming}} USB Power Delivery Specification revision3.0 defines {{new power}} rules based on supplied wattage. Programmable power supply protocol allows <b>granular</b> control over VBUS power in 10mV steps to facilitate constant current or constant voltage charging. Revision 3.0 also adds extended configuration messages, fast role swap, and deprecates the BFSK protocol.|$|E
5|$|According to the IUCN, further taxonomic {{investigation}} {{is required to}} confirm the black dogfish in the North Atlantic and the southeastern Atlantic represent the same species. A 2010 phylogenetic study by Nicolas Straube and colleagues, based on nuclear and mitochondrial DNA, found the black dogfish is the sister species of the whitefin dogfish (C.ritteri), and the two are, in turn, sister to the clade formed by the <b>granular</b> dogfish (C.granulatum) and combtooth dogfish (C.nigrum).|$|E
5|$|In 1999, the <b>granular</b> {{pavement}} {{section of}} Highway 2 south of Watrous was tested {{with a cold}} in-place recycling or “CIR” method to rehabilitate highways. This CIR process is a cost-effective method which recycles the top surface of a road. This pulverized material is mixed with asphalt emulsion and spread and compacted back onto the highway surface. This surface is then recovered with a new seal dependent on traffic volume.|$|E
5|$|Mossy fibers {{enter the}} <b>granular</b> layer from their points of origin, many {{arising from the}} pontine nuclei, others from the spinal cord, {{vestibular}} nuclei etc. In the human cerebellum, {{the total number of}} mossy fibers has been estimated at about 200 million. These fibers form excitatory synapses with the granule cells and the cells of the deep cerebellar nuclei. Within the <b>granular</b> layer, a mossy fiber generates a series of enlargements called rosettes. The contacts between mossy fibers and granule cell dendrites take place within structures called glomeruli. Each glomerulus has a mossy fiber rosette at its center, and up to 20 granule cell dendritic claws contacting it. Terminals from Golgi cells infiltrate the structure and make inhibitory synapses onto the granule cell dendrites. The entire assemblage is surrounded by a sheath of glial cells. Each mossy fiber sends collateral branches to several cerebellar folia, generating a total of 20–30 rosettes; thus a single mossy fiber makes contact with an estimated 400–600 granule cells.|$|E
5|$|Silicon carbide {{is used in}} {{carborundum}} printmaking – a collagraph printmaking technique. Carborundum grit {{is applied}} in a paste {{to the surface of}} an aluminium plate. When the paste is dry, ink is applied and trapped in its <b>granular</b> surface, then wiped from the bare areas of the plate. The ink plate is then printed onto paper in a rolling-bed press used for intaglio printmaking. The result is a print of painted marks embossed into the paper.|$|E
5|$|Spores are broadly {{ellipsoid}} in shape, amyloid, {{and have}} dimensions of either 8–10 by 6–7µm or 10–14 by 6.7–8.5µm {{depending on whether}} they originated from four-or two-spored basidia (spore-bearing cells), respectively. There are abundant cheilocystidia on the gill edges. They measure 30–50 by 7–12µm, and are fusoid-ventricose, with tips that are broadly rounded. They are filled with a purplish sap and have <b>granular</b> contents. The cap tissue comprises a well-differentiated cuticle, a distinct hypoderm, and a filamentous tramal body. Clamp connections in the hyphae are rare or absent.|$|E
5|$|The agaricoid {{species in}} Lactarius, Lactifluus, Multifurca, and Russula are readily {{distinguished}} from other gilled mushrooms by {{the consistency of}} their flesh, which is <b>granular,</b> brittle and breaks easily, somewhat {{like a piece of}} chalk. Russulaceae never have a volva, but a partial veil can be found in some tropical species. Gills are adnate to decurrent, and the colour of the spore print ranges from white to ochre or orange (with the brown-spored Lactarius chromospermus as an exception).|$|E
5|$|The protoplasmodium, a microscopic, {{undifferentiated}} <b>granular</b> {{mass with}} a slime sheath, is transparent and colourless. A single sporangiophore (the fruiting structure) is produced from the semispherical protoplasmodium, which is approximately {{one and a}} half times the diameter of mature sporangia. It acquires dark spots as it matures and the centre of the protoplasm later becomes dark. Then, the transparent and milk-white protoplasmodium climbs along the stem to the top, where first the capillitium and peridium and finally the spores are produced. At room temperature, this process lasts roughly one day.|$|E
5|$|The rotund to {{ellipsoid}} spores are 7.5–10µm {{long and}} 6–7.6µm wide. The surface ornamentation extends to 0.5µm high and is mainly from warts and short, wide ridges, which are linked through few fine lines {{to form an}} incomplete net (reticulum). The suprahilar area, a distinctly limited zone above the , is weakly amyloid. Basidia (spore-bearing cells) are four-spored and measure 45–60 × 9.5–12µm. They are roughly cylindrical to somewhat club-shaped and often have an oil droplet or a <b>granular</b> body. The sterigmata are 4.5–5.5µm long. The thin-walled pleurocystidia are sparse, but somewhat common near the gill edge. They are protruded and are 45–65µm long and 5–8µm wide, they are sometimes smaller near the gill edge. Nearly spindle-shaped, they are often straightened or constricted like a string of pearls at the apex. The body is often fine and grained. Pseudocystidia are largely present. They are 4–6µm wide and are sometimes protruded, but are often shorter than the basidioles (basidia in the early developmental stage). The basidioles are cylindric to spiral and have an ochre-coloured substance, similar to the laticifers. Near the top they are, however, almost hyaline (transparent). The gill edge is usually sterile and has a few to many cheilocystidia. The thin-walled cheiloleptocystidia are 15–25µm long and 5–10µm wide. They are almost club-shaped or irregularly shaped and transparent, and often contain a <b>granular</b> material. The cheilomacrocystidia are also thin-walled and measure 25–50µm long and 6–8µm wide. They are slightly spindle-shaped and often have a tip resembling a string of pearls; their interior is hyaline or <b>granular.</b> Laticifers are abundant, striking and body is ochre coloured. The cuticle of the cap is an ixocutis, whereby the hyphae are linked in a jellylike matrix, that can swell up in moisture to become heavily slimy.|$|E
5|$|The town of Kumbakonam is {{surrounded}} by extensive paddy fields. Methods of irrigation were considerably improved following {{the opening of the}} Mettur Dam in 1934. The fauna of the Cauvery Delta is limited to cattle and goats. The town is situated at the western flank of the Kumbakonam-Shiyali ridge which runs along the Kollidam river basin separating the Ariyalur-Puducherry depression from the Nagapattinam depression. This <b>granular</b> ridge projects further eastwards penetrating the Puducherry depression and forms a hard layer of cretaceous rock underneath the sedimentary top soil.|$|E
5|$|When {{observed}} {{under the}} electron microscope, the nucleolus {{can be seen}} to consist of three distinguishable regions: the innermost fibrillar centers (FCs), surrounded by the dense fibrillar component (DFC), which in turn is bordered by the <b>granular</b> component (GC). Transcription of the rDNA occurs either in the FC or at the FC-DFC boundary, and, therefore, when rDNA transcription in the cell is increased, more FCs are detected. Most of the cleavage and modification of rRNAs occurs in the DFC, while the latter steps involving protein assembly onto the ribosomal subunits occur in the GC.|$|E

25|$|Large {{masses of}} {{material}} are moved in debris flows, hyperconcentrated mixtures of mud, clasts that range up to boulder-size, and water. Debris flows move as <b>granular</b> flows down steep mountain valleys and washes. Because they transport sediment as a <b>granular</b> mixture, their transport mechanisms and capacities scale differently {{from those of}} fluvial systems.|$|E
25|$|Atomoxetine, or (−)-methylamine, is a white, <b>granular</b> powder that {{is highly}} soluble in water.|$|E
25|$|Fruit {{bodies of}} Exidia thuretiana are {{similarly}} coloured, but are typically more opaque and often appear pleated. They do not (or very rarely) contain white, <b>granular</b> inclusions. Microscopically, E.thuretiana {{can be distinguished}} by its sessile (not stalked) basidia. Fruit bodies of several gelatinous Tremella species may also appear similar, but never contain <b>granular</b> inclusions. All can be distinguished microscopically by their non- spores.|$|E
25|$|In {{temperate}} glaciers, snow repeatedly freezes and thaws, changing into <b>granular</b> ice called firn. Under {{the pressure}} of the layers of ice and snow above it, this <b>granular</b> ice fuses into denser and denser firn. Over a period of years, layers of firn undergo further compaction and become glacial ice. Glacier ice is slightly less dense than ice formed from frozen water because it contains tiny trapped air bubbles.|$|E
25|$|Amphibians possess {{two types}} of glands, mucous and <b>granular</b> (serous). Both of these glands {{are part of the}} {{integument}} and thus considered cutaneous. Mucous and <b>granular</b> glands are both divided into three different sections which all connect to structure the gland as a whole. The three individual parts of the gland are the duct, the intercalary region, and lastly the alveolar gland (sac). Structurally, the duct is derived via keratinocytes and passes through {{to the surface of the}} epidermal or outer skin layer thus allowing external secretions of the body. The gland alveolus is a sac shaped structure which is found on the bottom or base region of the <b>granular</b> gland. The cells in this sac specialize in secretion. Between the alveolar gland and the duct is the intercalary system which can be summed up as a transitional region connecting the duct to the grand alveolar beneath the epidermal skin layer. In general, <b>granular</b> glands are larger in size than the mucous glands, however mucous glands hold a much greater majority in overall number.|$|E

25|$|A sieve {{analysis}} (or gradation test) is a practice or procedure used (commonly used in civil engineering) {{to assess the}} particle size distribution (also called gradation) of a <b>granular</b> material.|$|E
25|$|PIV {{can also}} be used to measure the {{velocity}} field of the free surface and basal boundary in a <b>granular</b> flows such as those in shaken containers, tumblers and avalanches.|$|E
25|$|Large <b>granular</b> {{lymphocytic}} leukemia may involve either T-cells or NK cells; like hairy cell leukemia, which involves solely B cells, it {{is a rare}} and indolent (not aggressive) leukemia.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, a {{pet food}} recall was {{initiated}} by Menu Foods and other pet food manufacturers who had found their products had been contaminated and caused serious illnesses or deaths {{in some of}} the animals that had eaten them. In March 2007, the US Food and Drug Administration reported finding white <b>granular</b> melamine in the pet food, in samples of white <b>granular</b> wheat gluten imported from a single source in China, Xuzhou Anying Biologic Technology as well as in crystalline form in the kidneys and in urine of affected animals. Further vegetable protein imported from China was later implicated.|$|E
25|$|Histologically, {{molluscum contagiosum}} is {{characterized}} by molluscum bodies in the epidermis, above the stratum basale, which consist of large cells with abundant <b>granular</b> eosinophilic cytoplasm (accumulated virions) and a small peripheral nucleus.|$|E
25|$|Shock waves {{can also}} occur in rapid flows of dense <b>granular</b> {{materials}} down inclined channels or slopes. Strong shocks in rapid dense <b>granular</b> flows {{can be studied}} theoretically and analyzed to compare with experimental data. Consider a configuration in which the rapidly moving material down the chute impinges on an obstruction wall erected perpendicular {{at the end of}} a long and steep channel. Impact leads to a sudden change in the flow regime from a fast moving supercritical thin layer to a stagnant thick heap. This flow configuration is particularly interesting because it is analogous to some hydraulic and aerodynamic situations associated with flow regime changes from supercritical to subcritical flows.|$|E
25|$|Today {{the mine}} is {{predominantly}} exploited {{in an open}} pit quarry but several of the many underground mines (deep and extending over several km) still remain viable. Selenizza is produced primarily in <b>granular</b> form, after melting the bitumen pieces selected in the mine.|$|E
25|$|Within the Pearltrees product, every link {{collected}} in every account is fully public; however, {{the company is}} on record as saying that it plans to introduce <b>granular</b> privacy features {{in the future as}} on aspect of their monetization strategy.|$|E

25|$|Containment or {{agglomeration}} – Small {{objects are}} typically grouped {{together in one}} package for reasons of storage and selling efficiency. For example, a single box of 1000 pencils requires less physical handling than 1000 single pencils. Liquids, powders, and <b>granular</b> materials need containment.|$|E
25|$|The steel {{comprises}} a {{galvanised steel}} core, with a multi-layered protective coating and <b>granular</b> finish for better performance characteristics. The tile is in three satin finishes and a high-gloss silver {{and can be}} transported in situ in a building's roof.|$|E
25|$|There are {{different}} internal structural characteristics between axons and dendrites. Typical axons almost never contain ribosomes, except {{some in the}} initial segment. Dendrites contain <b>granular</b> endoplasmic reticulum or ribosomes, in diminishing amounts as {{the distance from the}} cell body increases.|$|E
25|$|Sugar cane {{was being}} grown in Louisiana, {{where it was}} refined into <b>granular</b> sugar. Growing and {{refining}} sugar required {{a large amount of}} capital. Some of the nation's wealthiest people owned sugar plantations, which often had their own sugar mills.|$|E
