40|$|This paper uses {{in-depth}} interviews with Finance Directors from UK firms that have recently issued convertible preference shares. The study examines the particular circumstances {{that were taken}} into account into the decision to issue convertible preference shares rather than the more common instruments of pure debt or pure equity. The paper relates {{the findings from the}} interviews to three theories that have been suggested for the <b>issuance</b> <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shares.</b> These theories are Pecking Order, Taxation and Financial Distress. Pecking Order is a general capital structure theory and the Taxation and Financial Distress theories have been developed from the general static trade off theory for capital structure. This paper examines whether “local ” decision making for specific instruments can be related to global generalisations for capital structure theories. The comments from the interviews suggest that global capital structure theories for the use of pure debt and pure equity are not {{a major factor in the}} decision to issue convertibl...|$|E

Its main strength is to help Chinese banks meet new capital adequacy requirements and to stimulate the stagnant stock market, and its core danger is its potential misuse by dominant shareholders to expropriate profits from minority common shareholders {{in the context of}} weak minority shareholder protection and insufficient cash dividends in the Chinese stock market. Empirical evidence gives partial support to this understanding of its danger because the impact <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> on existing common shareholders is mixed and differs among different types of companies. This article also shows that the current regulatory regime in China provides comprehensive protection for preference shareholders and that compared with minority common shareholders, preference shareholders are in an advantageous position. ...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} the unification <b>of</b> non-voting <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> into a one share-one vote structure using {{a sample of}} all German dual-class companies from 1987 until 2003. We test several hypotheses {{with regard to the}} reasons for the abolition <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shares.</b> First, as the separation of ownership and control is viewed as a means of keeping control over a firm, a detailed analysis of changes in the ownership structure of firms abolishing their <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> is performed. Indeed, family firms losing the majority of control by unifying their share classes seem to restrain from this step by selling controlling blocks before the unification. Second, dualclass firms may comprise higher agency costs due to the violation of the one share-one vote rule and, thus, face higher costs of equity capital. We apply two methods for estimating changes in the cost of capital of unifying firms : (i) we perform an event study to examine the market reaction to the announcement of share class unifications and (ii) we investigate bid-ask spreads before and after the unification computed from intraday trading data to analyze liquidity effects on the cost of capital associated with the unification. In sum, the unification <b>of</b> dual-class <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> into single -class voting shares seems to be strictly shareholder value increasing. Dual-class firms {{seem to be able to}} significantly reduce their cost of capital through unification, because of increases in firm value as well as a substantial reduction in bid-ask spreads. dual-class shares, share class unification, cost of capital, event study,announcement effects, bid-ask spreads, liquidity...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} share price {{response}} to the announcement of private placements of hybrid securities in Australia. Firstly, the size and direction of {{the share price}} response is examined. Secondly, the determinants of the share price response are examined. Where possible, comparisons are made to evidence from international markets. The sample of data tested consists of 43 announcements of convertible debt issues, 39 announcements <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> issues and 19 announcements of option issues made between 1983 and 2000 by Australian firms. The analysis of the share price impact in response to the announcements is conducted using Maynes and Rumsey (1993) event study methodology that adjusts for thin trading. The determinants of the share price response are examined using model specifications that are derived from the theoretical literature. The analysis of the announcement effect of private placements of hybrid securities finds significant negative abnormal returns for convertible debt issues, insignificant negative abnormal returns for <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> issues and significant positive abnormal returns for option issues. In comparison to international studies, the convertible debt results are similar to public and rights issues, the insignificant <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> results are similar to other findings and the option results are similar to private placements of equity and rights issues of options. The results of the investigation of the determinants of the announcement effect of private placements of hybrid securities finds that convertible debt issues are best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry - external monitors hypothesis, the information asymmetry - dynamic hypothesis and the agency cost hypothesis. The impact <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> <b>share</b> issues is best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry - external monitors hypothesis, the agency cost hypothesis and the price pressure hypothesis. The announcement effect of option issues is best explained by information asymmetry - firm and issue characteristics, the information asymmetry -dynamic hypothesis and the optimal capital structure hypothesis...|$|R

500|$|The act forbade {{the company}} from issuing shares below £10 so, to make them easier for {{ordinary}} people to buy, they issued shilling coupons in books of ten {{so they could be}} paid for in instalments. [...] The construction costs and expected competition from the Port of Liverpool put off potential investors; by May 1887 only £3 million had been raised. As a temporary solution Thomas Walker, the contractor selected to construct the canal, agreed to accept £500,000 of the contract price in shares, but raising the remainder required another Act of Parliament to allow the company's share capital to be restructured as £3 million of ordinary <b>shares</b> and £4million <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shares.</b> Adamson was convinced that the money should be raised from members of the public and opposed the debt restructuring, resigning as chairman of the Ship Canal Committee on 1 February 1887. Barings and Rothschild jointly issued a prospectus for the sale <b>of</b> the <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> on 15 July, and by 21 July the issue had been fully underwritten, allowing construction to begin.

40|$|The {{intention}} of {{the introduction of a}} secondary tax on companies (STC) and the lowering of the normal income tax rate in 1993 was to encourage companies to re-invest profits to make use of capital investment opportunities. The 2007 budget again raised questions about how the proposed changes in STC would impact the value of companies. This study investigates the effect of these tax changes and all subsequent changes since 1993 on the cost of capital. An up-to-date analysis of payout ratios of listed SA companies indicates a steady decline from a median of 40 % in 1993 to a median of 26 % in 2006, vindicating STC to a certain extent. However, instead of lowering the cost of capital of companies in South Africa, it appears as if these tax measures actually increased the WACCs, all other things being equal, by more than 0. 5 %. As typical free cash flow valuations have WACC in the denominator, and considering the number of companies affected, the destruction of shareholder wealth is considerable. Needless to say, there is no stronger disincentive for increased capital investment than value destruction. The most important insight coming to the fore in this study is that if an opportunity cost approach is followed, the cost of equity is unaffected by both the STC and the dividend payout ratio. The cost <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> is actually increased by the STC, even if its impact is limited because of the low average weight and use <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shares</b> in capital structures. The after-tax cost of debt is negatively impacted by decreases in the normal tax rate...|$|R

40|$|Contrary {{to popular}} belief, therefore, {{both at the}} time and since, the {{evidence}} for democratization of the shareholding population is relatively thin. The pattern identified by the Economist in 1926 and 1927 seems not to have been the arrival in the share market of a new group of non-traditional investors, but rather a change in behaviour by the classes who had been investors from the mid- to late nineteenth century onwards. Despite the growing numbers of lower middleclass and working-class savers, and the limited attempt to promote various employee schemes, in terms of social class the democratization of share ownership remained limited largely to holders <b>of</b> <b>preference</b> <b>shares.</b> To the extent that this type of share issue grew in importance, so too did the social composition of the shareholding population widen, both in relation to gender as well as occupational group.
