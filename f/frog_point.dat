50|$|The {{point where}} two {{straight}} but intersecting railroads cross {{is called a}} frog. A groove through each rail allows the wheel flanges {{to pass through the}} intersecting rails. Without countermeasures each wheel would dip into the groove and strike the <b>frog</b> <b>point</b> gap causing unacceptable wear. The point where two tracks join and the vehicle can take one of two directions is called a railway switch. This works on the same principle, except that the inner rail is almost continuous and the outer rail has a gap for the flange to pass through.|$|E
40|$|Transportation Technology Center, Inc., {{a wholly}} owned {{subsidiary}} of the Association of American Railroads, has developed a double rail model for special trackwork simulation in the NUCARS® 1 vehicle/track interaction multi-body dynamic simulation program. The double rail model consists of a primary rail and a secondary rail {{on each side of}} the track. it It permits one wheel to contact two rails so that the effects of their relative movements on wheel/rail contact can be investigated. It also allows rail profile and track suspension stiffness and damping to vary on the track. This paper presents simulation results of a freight car running on a No. 20 turnout. Simulation results showed that the double rail model improved the integration stability and simulation accuracy for high frequency wheel/rail (W/R) impacts by capturing the simultaneous multiple W/R contact point situations and transitions under various discontinuous track running surface conditions. Parametric studies of W/R impacts on frog points showed the <b>frog</b> <b>point</b> geometry designs have conflicting requirements for dynamic performance for vehicles equipped with with new wheels and hollow-worn wheels; the NUCARS double rail model provides a useful tool for frog and switch point geometry optimization...|$|E

50|$|Construction of the {{dedicated}} tracks of the LGV Atlantique was officially decided on 25 May 1984. Ground was broken on 15 February 1985. The new line was to stretch from slightly outside the Gare Montparnasse in Paris to Le Mans, {{with a second}} branch towards Tours. The Le Mans branch was opened for 300 km/h (186 mph) revenue service on 20 September 1989, and the Tours branch opened a year later. The two branches separate at Courtalain, 130 km west of Paris, where movable <b>frog</b> <b>points</b> good for 220 km/h (137 mph) in the diverging route direct trains towards either Le Mans or Tours.|$|R
5000|$|After 26 days of contemplation, Howe {{decided against}} a frontal attack on Harlem Heights and Fort Washington, and chose instead {{to attempt a}} {{flanking}} maneuver. [...] On October 12, leaving behind three brigades {{under the command of}} Lord Hugh Percy on Manhattan Island, Howe embarked his main army in 80 vessels and proceeded up the East River, through Hell Gate, and landed at Throgs Neck. [...] Throgs Neck - originally known as Throckmorton's, and also known as Throck's, Frog's Neck, and <b>Frog's</b> <b>Point</b> - is a narrow spit of land that sits between the East River and Long Island Sound. Conveniently for Howe, there was a road running from Throgs Neck to Kingsbridge, directly behind the American forces.

We concentrated in this case on the proof of the smooth and rough sarcoplasmic reticulum of the sole plate. The relations of the smooth and rough sarcoplasmic reticulum to subsynaptic folds and the local T-system and its connections to diads and triads in the sole plate area are represented.

40|$|The main {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to examine the natural history and the ecology of the species that constitute a snake assemblage in the Atlantic Rainforest, at Núcleo Picinguaba, Parque Estadual da Serra do Mar, located on the northern coast of the state of São Paulo, southeastern Brazil. The main aspects studied were: richness, relative abundance, daily and seasonal activity, and substrate use. We also provide additional information on natural history of the snakes. A total of 282 snakes, distributed over 24 species, belonging to 16 genera and four families, has been found within the area of the Núcleo Picinguaba. Species sampled more frequently were Bothrops jararaca and B. jararacussu. The methods that yielded the best results were time constrained search and opportunistic encounters. Among the abiotic factors analyzed, minimum temperature, followed by the mean temperature and the rainfall are apparently the most important in determining snake abundance. Most species presented a diet concentrated on one prey category or restricted to a few kinds of food items. The large number of species that feed on <b>frogs</b> <b>points</b> out the importance of this kind of prey as an important food resource for snakes in the Atlantic Rainforest. Our results indicate that the structure of the Picinguaba snake assemblage reflects mainly the phylogenetic constraints of each of its lineages...|$|R

50|$|Glass frogs have {{similarities}} to tree frogs. They look {{very close to}} the naked eye except glass <b>frog's</b> eyes <b>point</b> forward and are golden. During the day, these frogs camouflage themselves under leaves but above water. Male glass frogs are 19-28 mm long while females measure from 23-32 mm long. They have a green semi-translucent color with yellow translucent hands. Their skin has dots which matches that of the leaves in the area. When confronted or approached, they tend to freeze up and not move. It is not specifically known what the glass frog eats, but it is assumed that they feed on small insects.|$|R
5000|$|Strongylopus fasciatus is a small, long legged <b>frog</b> with a <b>pointed</b> snout.

50|$|The {{conventional}} way {{to increase}} turnout speeds is to lengthen the turnout and use a shallower frog angle. If the frog angle is so shallow that a fixed frog cannot support a train's wheels, a swingnose crossing (US: moveable <b>point</b> <b>frog)</b> will be used. Higher speeds are possible without lengthening the turnout by using uniformly curved rail and a very low entry angle; however, wider track centers may be needed.|$|R

50|$|Attempts to make finer tyre and flange {{standards}} were thwarted initially by the overscale rail sections available commercially, it being impractical {{for an individual}} modeller to make smaller rails - although some did attempt to, by cutting down commercial rail. Smaller flange and tyre dimensions were also unsuccessful, as the narrow tyres tended to detach from the wheel centres. More critically, small flanges required comparably smaller rail, trackwork gaps and <b>point</b> <b>frogs</b> {{in order to work}} reliably.|$|R
5000|$|... "Basket arch" [...] {{turnouts}} (Korbbogenweichen) {{were built}} in 1988 at Saalbach junction so that trains could branch at 200 km/h. They were initially the most elaborate turnouts in Germany. As {{the continuation of the}} high-speed line to Stuttgart was then under construction, the points were initially fixed in the branching position. Their length is 154 m and their weight (including the concrete sleepers) is 210 t. The point blades are 40 m-long, the moveable <b>point</b> <b>frogs</b> are 15 m long. The radius of the branching track is initially 7,000 m and reduces at the frog to 6000 m. The two sets of point blades are operated by two turnout motors with eight points of activation and closed with eight clamps. Separate test contacts are used to monitor the position of the points. The moveable <b>point</b> <b>frogs</b> are activated by a motor and secured by three clip fasteners. In the points area, two points signals are installed at the approaches and a third in the centre of the turnout. Another innovation was the use of slide chairs that require little lubrication. The two turnouts are still among the fastest in terms of operating speeds in Germany.|$|R
50|$|The {{guttural}} puddle frog {{is a small}} <b>frog</b> with a <b>pointed</b> snout and warty skin, {{growing to}} a snout-to-vent length of about 14 to 16 mm for males and 17 to 19 mm. The digits do not have enlarged tips and the fingers are unwebbed. The dorsal surface is greenish or brownish with dark blotches, sometimes bordered with black. The limbs are barred with green and the underparts are whitish. The male has a black vocal sac on the throat and the female has a black patch spotted with white on the throat.|$|R
50|$|Ptychadena trinodis is a {{relatively}} large <b>frog</b> with a <b>pointed</b> head. Males measure 42 - 52 mm and females 47 - 57 mm in snout-vent length. Males have paired lateral vocal sacs. The tympanum is large and distinct. There are three pairs of continuous dorsal ridges that start {{at the level of}} the eyes, and a shorter, median pair. The hind legs are sturdy and of moderate length. The inner metatarsal tubercle is massive, almost as long as the shortest toe. The colouration is generally brownish or grayish, with black or dark brown spots present on dorsal ridges, flanks, and the dorsum.|$|R
50|$|As in Zuma, {{the main}} {{objective}} of Zuma's Revenge! is to clear strings of rolling balls, or 'stones', by matching balls {{of the same}} color. Players move a ball-shooting <b>frog</b> which always <b>points</b> {{in the direction of}} the mouse to aim and fire balls at these strings. When three or more balls of the same color match together, they are cleared from the playfield. This clearing creates gaps through which a player may shoot more balls at nearby strings, target bonus fruit, and 'power up' stones. Gaps automatically close if the balls at either end of the gap are (or become) the same color, potentially creating chain reaction matching and clearing as new sets of three or more are formed.|$|R
50|$|R. bipunctatus is a smallish tree <b>frog</b> with a <b>pointed</b> snout {{and body}} length of about 37-60 mm when adult, with females being larger than males. Its back is {{intensely}} green to violet-brown in living animals; in preserved specimens, this becomes blue to violet. No conspicuous pattern is {{visible on the}} back, though {{there may be a}} few tiny whitish and/or dark speckles. The arms and legs have very faint darker bands. The sides, belly and toes are brilliant yellow, becoming dull pink in preserved specimens. Behind the arms, there is almost always a conspicuous large black spot on the flanks; towards the hind legs there may be another one or two such spots, but very rarely the flank spots are absent entirely. The well-developed webbing of the toes is bright orange-red and not spotted, becoming whitish in preserved specimens. The eyes are dull green, sometimes with yellow rims.|$|R
50|$|R. rhodopus is a smallish tree <b>frog</b> with a <b>pointed</b> snout {{and body}} length of about 31-55 mm when adult, with females being larger than males. Its back is reddish-, pinkish-, or yellowich-brown without any green hues in living animals; in {{preserved}} specimens this becomes purplish brown. There are many darker spots {{all over the}} back, usually forming an X-shaped pattern behind the head and sometimes stripes across the lower back. Sometimes, {{there are a few}} large white spots on the back, also. The hind legs and the upper sides of the arms are for the most part or entirely the color of the back; there are usually dark bands across the upperside of arms and hind legs. The sides, belly and toes are dark yellow, becoming dark pink in preserved specimens. Behind the arms, there is almost always a conspicuous large black spot on the flanks. The well-developed webbing of the toes is bright orange-red and not spotted. The eyes are light brown.|$|R
50|$|It {{was clear}} that the {{signalling}} technology was the responsibility of the individual Reichsbahn divisions. While the Ludwigsfelde-Dennewitz section, which was controlled by the Berlin Reichsbahn division, was equipped until 1978 with track plan interlockings (including the first interlocking of the GsIIISp68 class in Jüterbog station) and automatic block signalling, the Niedergörsdorf-Leipzig section, which was controlled by the Halle Reichsbahn division, continued to be signalled with conventional systems. As part of its resignalling with the Punktförmige Zugbeeinflussung train protection system the remaining semaphore signals were replaced by colour light signals. During the upgrade to 200 km/h, the whole line was equipped with electronic interlockings between 1992 and 1999. Since then continuous two-way working has been possible, using only Kombinationsignale(combination signals). During the remodelling of Muldenstein station, moveable <b>point</b> <b>frogs</b> were inserted into the continuous track at the northern end of the station. In addition, all level crossings were eliminated and new bridges were built. These included the northern Mulde flood bridge near Muldenstein, the Mulde bridge and the Leine bridge. These three new prestressed concrete girder bridges replaced arch bridges built in 1857.|$|R
40|$|Even {{though the}} green frog (Rana esculenta) {{is often used}} as an {{experimental}} model for further studies of physiological laws, little is still known about its serum proteins and their role in immunity. Its serum proteins have been studied quite extensively, as when they are taken up into the organism of another animal they represent antigens themselves. In this work, {{an attempt was made}} to isolate some frog serum proteins and to investigate the electrophoretic qualities of the isolated components (electrophoresis on agar gel and immunoelectrophoresis). IgG was isolated using the same procedure applied for human sera and one of the components found in the beta globulin zone was isolated from frog serum by the same procedure. Immunoelectrophoretic analysis, carried out with the full antiserum of a rabbit, obtained by immunization of the rabbit with the frog serum, showed that the isolated component was pure. The obtained results confirm {{the fact that there are}} no slow gamma globulins in the <b>frog</b> serum and <b>point</b> out that this procedure, used for isolating human IgG class, is also suitable for isolating one protein component from the serum of the frog, which has the electrophoretic speed of beta globulin and which may represent one category of frog immunoglobulins...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of Phase II of a Federal Railroad Administration sponsored study looking at low-cost means to increase speeds through turnouts by retrofit or upgrade. To meet this objective, lead length and frog angle were considered fixed, eliminating the costs to relocate the <b>frog</b> or switch <b>points.</b> Based on extensive research, it was determined in Phase I that the best solution was to optimize the existing AREMA geometry by reducing the switch angle, incorporating a new diverging switch rail, and reshaping both the curved stock and closure rails. Dynamic simulations showed that higher speeds could be achieved over the optimized geometry without increasing peak wheel/rail forces experienced over the traditional geometry. In Phase II the new design was tested by retrofitting an AREMA # 20 crossover on New Jersey Transit. Full testing of the crossover included comparison with a standard AREMA # 20 based on lateral and vertical wheel/rail forces and lateral car body accelerations. From current observations and test results, the new turnout design meets the goal of providing a low-cost means to increase the speeds through existing turnouts. By establishing a superior geometry within the same dimensions as the AREMA standard, railroads {{will be able to make}} the necessary modifications at low cost and without the need of additional space. In addition, this approach, applicable to the large majority of existing turnouts, is expected to result in improved ride quality and decreased wear, leading to a longer service life and decreased maintenance costs...|$|R
5000|$|Later that year, Jimmy {{had one of}} {{the most}} memorable feuds in his career with Ric Flair, who was eyeing Precious. He sent her gifts and this caused lots of buildup for a big cage match between Flair and Jimmy during the 1987 Great American Bash stop in Greensboro, North Carolina for Flair's NWA World Title. The {{stipulation}} was added that if Flair won the match, he would get a date with Precious. During the match, Jimmy attempted a leap <b>frog</b> at one <b>point</b> but landed on one knee instead of his feet. Pain in the knee was [...] "sold" [...] by him during the rest of the match. This match got so heated that a fan actually attempted to climb into the cage to help Garvin. The fan was apprehended just at the moment he was about to get in. Flair ended up winning the match when he put Jimmy in the figure four leglock, Jimmy blacked out from the pain in his knee and his shoulders hit the mat for a count of three. Ron Garvin then entered the cage when the match was over and attacked Flair in order to defend Jimmy from further damage to his knee. When the date with Precious that Flair won occurred, Flair and James J. Dillon ended up being punched out by Ron Garvin, who was dressed in his [...] "Miss Atlanta Lively" [...] outfit. Just two months later, Ron successfully unseated Flair as NWA World Champion, holding on to the title until Starrcade '87 when Flair regained the belt.|$|R
