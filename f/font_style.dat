2500|$|The {{artwork and}} {{character}} designs {{of the first}} Final Fantasy were created by Yoshitaka Amano, a noted artist {{who had worked with}} Tatsunoko Production on multiple notable anime series including Science Ninja Team Gatchaman, and also did illustrations for Vampire Hunter D. Amano was brought on board the first Final Fantasy as general artwork designer, filling that role for Final Fantasy II and Final Fantasy III. For Final Fantasy IV, Amano was given more freedom to create elaborate character designs. Amano returned as character designer and general artwork for Final Fantasy V. Final Fantasy VI, in addition to featuring work by Amamo, also had contributions from other designers including Kaori Tanaka. From the first Final Fantasy to Final Fantasy IV, Amano created his artwork based on specific descriptions from game staff, while for Final Fantasy V and Final Fantasy VI it was the game staff that took and adjusted his artwork to suit the games. He returned as a character designer for Final Fantasy IX, working from specifications provided by the game's staff. For Final Fantasy XI, Amano created the game's world map. One of the designs he recalled was for the summon Bahamut: while the original Bahamut was an aquatic monster, he did not know this at the time, so he designed Bahamut as a [...] "mecha dragon". As of Final Fantasy XV, Amano's artwork has been created fairly early in a game's development based on the basic themes. Amano's most enduring contribution to the series is his logo designs: receiving design documents as primarily text-based requests and descriptions, he treats each logo as a piece of full artwork rather than a simple logo. Since Final Fantasy IV, the current <b>font</b> <b>style</b> was adopted, along with a specially-designed logo by Amano. The emblem relates to a title's respective plot and typically portrays a character or object in the story. Subsequent remakes of the first three games have replaced the previous logos with ones similar {{to the rest of the}} series. His work on Final Fantasy brought him international fame.|$|E

5000|$|Multiple master fonts (or MM fonts) are an {{extension}} to Adobe Systems' Type 1 PostScript fonts. Multiple master fonts contain {{one or more}} [...] "masters" [...] — that is, original <b>font</b> <b>styles,</b> e.g. a light, a regular and a bold version — and enable a user to interpolate these <b>font</b> <b>styles</b> along a continuous range of [...] "axes." [...] While Multiple Master font are not common in end user fonts anymore, they still {{play an important role}} when developing complex font families.|$|R
50|$|Additionally, {{many older}} browsers did not {{implement}} inheritance of <b>font</b> <b>styles</b> within tables; as a result, <b>font</b> <b>styles</b> {{had to be}} specified once for the document as a whole, and again for the table, even though the CSS specification requires that <b>font</b> <b>styling</b> be inherited into the table. If the font sizes are specified using relative units, a standards-compliant browser would inherit the base font size, then apply the relative font size within the table: for example, a page which declared a base font size of 80% and a table font size of 80% (to ensure a size of 80% in browsers which do not properly inherit font sizes) would, in a standards-compliant browser, display tables with a font size of 64% (80% of 80%). As a result, browsers typically do not inherit font sizes into tables in quirks mode.|$|R
