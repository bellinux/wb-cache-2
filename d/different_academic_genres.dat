30|$|The {{first issue}} to be {{investigated}} consists of what the prototypical incidence of ideational grammatical metaphors across <b>different</b> <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> is, namely question-and-answer and essay, {{and whether or not}} there may be inherent differences between text genres within such a parameter. Our primary aim here is to contrast two comparable subsets of texts drawn from the CLAE: Mexican vs. Californian question-and-answer documents. This would allow for the identification of how abstract and compact the question-and-answer genre produced in a bilingual (Spanish-English) context is compared to the homologous genre produced in the monolingual—that is, Spanish-only—setting of Mexico.|$|E
40|$|Thanks to {{the recent}} {{developments}} {{in the theory of}} academic discourse anal-ysis, it is now increasingly accepted that negotiation of academic knowledge is intimately related to the social practices of academic communities. To underpin this position and to reveal some of the ways this is achieved, this article analyzes a relatively wide spectrum of academic texts (20 research articles, 20 handbook chapters, 20 scholarly textbook chapters, and 20 intro-ductory textbook chapters) in applied linguistics. The authors show here the importance of establishing social relationships in academic arguments, suggest some of the ways this is achieved, and indicate how the social and institutional differences that underlie production and reception of <b>different</b> <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> influence the ways metadiscourse is shaped in academic communication...|$|E
40|$|In {{light of}} the {{understanding}} that {{the analysis of the}} generic features of <b>different</b> <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> can enhance the ability of non-native members of academic discourse communities to understand, and where appropriate, to produce them, the present study aimed at investigating the dominant generic structure of research articles in mathematics. To start with a relatively narrow focus, a corpus of thirty mathematics research articles were randomly selected from The Bulletin of the Iranian Mathematical Society(BIMS), and were analyzed in terms of their macro-organizational structure. An eleven-move structure was identified in the analyzed corpus, while it was also found that the research articles in the corpus did not follow the conventional Introduction-Methods-Results-Discussion structure found in many other disciplines. Methods and Discussion sections which are frequently encountered in research articles of many other disciplines were missing in the analyzed articles. It is argued that the findings may have theoretical implications in revealing some discipline specific conventions of organizing macro structure. Since all the authors were Iranian, the emerging model should be treated cautiously because some aspects of the emerging macro structure may also be under the influence of culture specific conventions...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{presents}} a comparative empirical study of fixed collocational patterns in written academic English. The fixed collocational pattern is a continuous string of words which {{is found to}} occur frequently in language data. This study uses lexical analysis software to study an electronic corpus of academic research articles {{in an attempt to}} identify and compare the forms and discourse functions of fixed collocational patterns in different disciplines. In comparative studies of the language of <b>different</b> <b>academic</b> disciplines there are two ways of collecting comparable amounts of corpus data, both of which are problematic. One approach is to subdivide existing normative (Sinclair 2005) corpora in order to allow comparisons to be made between different disciplines. The amount of data in each resulting subcorpus is often unequal, however, and results might be biased in favour of the subcorpus with the greatest number of texts or tokens. The other approach is to balance the number of tokens in each subcorpus by using incomplete text samples. This can mean that individual subcorpora do not completely represent all areas of the discourse, and some fixed collocational patterns which perform discourse functions relating to these areas may as a result be missed by the researcher. This study attempts to establish what might be a comparable amount of data by investigating fixed collocational patterns in two different comparative corpora. First it identifies fixed collocational patterns in an equal number of tokens in each discipline, i. e. an isolexical comparison. It then identifies fixed collocational patterns in an equal number of texts in each discipline, i. e. an isotextual comparison. The findings indicate that the same fixed collocational patterns are frequent in both versions of the corpus, and so what is frequent isolexically is also frequent isotextually. This suggests that an isotextual corpus is more suitable for comparative studies of the discourse functions of fixed collocational patterns, since it allows their functions to be investigated across similar numbers of communicative acts rather than across similar amounts of language. The thesis then compares these isotextual fixed collocational patterns with the results from two previous studies of an isolexical collocational pattern, the lexical bundle (Biber et al. 1999), one of which (Biber 2006) used data from a <b>different</b> <b>academic</b> <b>genre,</b> the other (Hyland 2008) data from three <b>academic</b> <b>genres.</b> There then follows a case study {{of the relationship between the}} lexical, semantic, and textual environments of the fixed collocational pattern in the case of the and its discourse functions. The thesis concludes by outlining areas of future research into fixed collocational patterns which have been suggested by the results of this study.

40|$|Despite the {{recognition}} of students’ difficulties, the teaching of academic writing has no tradition in higher education in Portugal. There are, however, some successful approaches to this area, carried out in some universities where, {{at the suggestion of}} some professors, optional courses are being offered to undergraduate and postgraduate students (Carvalho, 2012). The aim {{of this paper is to}} present and discuss a course, organized in one of the new Portuguese universities, which aims to promote the academic literacy skills of its students. Placing the issue of academic writing in the broader framework of academic literacies (Lea & Street, 1998; Russell et al, 2009), this course aims at raising students' awareness of academic language and its role in learning and expressing knowledge. Focussing both comprehension and writing processes, the course enhances students’ consciousness of the high specificity of academic texts that stems not only from their scientific domain but also from the commuinities and contexts in which they are produced and read. Furthermore, the course is predominantly practical, since it aims an appropriation of the textual genres by the students through actions of use of the language in a real context of learning (Carlino, 2013). In addition to its theoretical ground, this presentation discusses the rationale of the contents, the methodologies and the evaluation processes of the course, which is eminently practical. It implies several reading and writing tasks involving <b>different</b> <b>academic</b> textual <b>genres.</b> As a conclusion, students’ achievements and difficulties are analysed.

40|$|Successful {{academic}} writing {{depends on}} being familiar with different rhetorical strategies. One {{of these strategies}} used by authors of scientific articles is the act of criticism, the criticism of the previous works or other members of their respective communities. Actually this helps writers to justify their own study {{and to create a}} gap. Therefore the socio-pragmatic variable of Academic Conflict (AC) has been investigated in <b>different</b> <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> and disciplines. This study aims to examine this variable in linguistics papers in Persian and English. To this end a corpus of 60 papers, 30 in Persian and 30 in English, have been chosen randomly. First in the quantitative phase of the study, the direct and indirect AC variables that have been used for critical speech acts were compared by within and between languages and then in a qualitative examine, the discourse analysis of important features were examined to show the probable relations to the cultural contexts. The results showed that English writers used more criticism acts than Persian writers and both groups used direct AC more than indirect one. Although both groups of papers are written in different cultural contexts, the strategies used by authors seem familiar and have minute differences and this may show that the effect of discipline and the language of instruction are more than cultural contexts in rhetoric of criticism...|$|E
40|$|This study {{investigated}} the use of lexical bundles in research articles written in English by Turkish scholars. For {{the purpose of the}} study, a corpus of published research articles produced by Turkish scholars in six <b>different</b> <b>academic</b> disciplines was collected. The four-word lexical bundles that appeared at least twenty times in this one million word corpus were identified and further analyzed both structurally and functionally based on the previous taxonomies developed by Biber, Johansson, Leech, Conrad and Finegan (1999) and Biber, Conrad and Cortes (2004). The results of this study revealed that the lexical bundles found have structural correlates as well as strong functional features that help to construct discourse in academic writing. The conclusions drawn from this study could be applied to the teaching of <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> to researchers in English as a Foreign Language context and are expected to provide insights for further corpus-based studies in academic writing...|$|R
40|$|International audienceThe {{comparative}} lack {{of interest}} in oral academic corpora and in comparisons between spoken and written academic discourse is surprising in that research on academic registers has found that mode differences are extremely important in accounting for linguistic variation (e. g.

Spoken <b>academic</b> <b>genres,</b> such as conference presentations, display a very different range of lexico-grammatical features from written <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> (Carter-Thomas & Rowley-Jolivet, 2001). It was therefore with the aim of redressing this balance that the EIIDA project was created.

To answer the questions that guided this research, two procedures were adopted: first, questionnaires were administered to students from a specialization course on teaching of Portuguese language. Then, we analyzed a corpus of 10 monographs for completion of the course, with their respective drafts, to reflect the construction process.

40|$|Evaluation, as the {{expression}} of a writer’s attitudes, opinions and values, has become a key term in discourse studies in recent years and {{has proved to be a}} particularly fruitful way of analysing academic texts. But while studies have shown the importance of evaluation in research genres, its role in seemingly more promotional <b>academic</b> <b>genres</b> has been largely neglected. This article examines the journal description (JD), a brief but ubiquitous feature of all journals, whether online or in print. Situated at the academic—commercial interface, the JD provides information for prospective readers and authors while endorsing a particular view of the field and positioning the journal in the academic community. Drawing on a corpus of 200 JDs in four contrasting disciplines, we show how evaluation is a key feature of this genre, influencing both lexical choices and rhetorical structure. The analysis contributes both to our understanding of a neglected <b>academic</b> <b>genre</b> and the evaluative resources of language...|$|R

40|$|First year {{students}} often experience a culture shock as certain literacy practices {{at the university}} level are different from their experiences in high schools. Some major challenges that students encounter include students’ ability to maintain academic integrity practices in their studies, to comprehend complex academic texts to outline key ideas, and to communicate confidently and effectively in diverse <b>academic</b> <b>genres.</b> As these challenges are common, often universities offer activities to assist students’ with their academic enculturation process. The three popular literacy teaching models currently in practice are the generic, embedded and literacies models. All the three models offer challenges in their effective practice. By evaluating the ethnographic data from the models used at UNSW Canberra Academic Language Learning Unit (ALL), this paper argues that in line with Lea and Street’s (2006) discussion, literacies is the most effective approach for developing students’ lifelong skills for effective communication, reading and critical thinking. Literary teaching should involve an advanced inquiry into writing practices in diverse disciplines helping students’ identifying and practicing using language devices and rhetorical structures in <b>academic</b> <b>genres...</b>|$|R

The corpus used in this study consisted of 150 published book reviews from different disciplines in English and Turkish. In order to understand how writers engaged in their reviews and interacted with their readers, Hyland's (2000) metadiscourse model was used to identify interpersonal markers in book reviews. With a focus of five common features from this model, hedges, emphatics (boosters), attitude markers, relational markers, and person markers were used as categories to be investigated. Relying on a quantitative data analysis followed by qualitative analysis, {{it was found that the}} total number of interpersonal metadiscourse features was considerably higher in the English corpus than in the Turkish corpus.
