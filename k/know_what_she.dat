In an interview a year later {{she said she did}} not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing in her first tape and did not remember a thing about it. Her second video, also for Max-A, was Don't Close Your Eyes and Hayasaka said that it was particularly hard for her, bringing her to tears, because she had little experience with adult toys. Hayasaka was acknowledged by fans for her work in her debut year by being named Best New Actress at the 2001 X City Grand Prix Awards held in December 2001.|$|E

Chris tells Lois that he saw this, so Lois, Peter, Cleveland, Joe and Quagmire track them down at the Barrington Hotel. When they arrive, they see Meg has tied Brian up with {{packaging}} tape and is about to rape Brian. Lois tells Meg that she is not thinking right, although Meg insists that she has never been more sure of anything in her life. Lois struggles to explain and says Meg does not <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> needs, and then Quagmire says (in an erotic tone) [...] "I <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> needs... Bring her by my house around 8:30 tonight I'll take care of her." [...] This implies that he will try to take advantage of Meg and when she arrives at Quagmire's house, it seems even more likely; he tells her to sit down and says [...] "Soon it'll all become clear", puts on seductive music, dims the lights, strips down to a speedo and sits down beside her; but suddenly, Quagmire (uncharacteristically) begins to have a serious heart-to-heart talk with Meg, telling her that her entire life is still ahead of her and she should not be in such a hurry to grow up before assuring her that she will find the right person one day. To help Meg, Quagmire gives her his copy of The Missing Piece to help give her a better perception of things, and sends her away feeling much better. He then walks into his bedroom, where two of his one-night stands await with an array of sex toys, {{and it turns out that}} all of Quagmire's seemingly erotic antics were actually in preparation for this tryst. One of the women asks Quagmire if he has the [...] "hwhip" [...] (with emphasis on the [...] "h") and Quagmire responds with disbelief.|$|E
500|$|Initially, Imran Khan and Ranbir Kapoor were {{supposed}} to play {{two of the three}} leads, but they declined because they wished to star together in their own production.

[...] Hrithik was chosen for another lead role, since he was a favourite actor of hers.

She acknowledged her role in reaction in influencing him on personnel decisions, saying [...] "In no way do I apologize for it."

Regarding her acting abilities, Foley stressed on the fact that Madonna was very uptight and into every detail, determined to have the correct portrayal. [...] "That's probably why it wasn't so good.

The {{song was}} the first of the four performances planned, and Gaga opened the show with her sitting on the piano. She appeared bald but wore a teal colored fringed dress, and sang an acoustic version of [...] "Hair", while staring at a teal colored wig placed in front of her. The piano on which she sang was covered with brown, curly hair and she was surrounded by flames. Halfway through the performance, Gaga took the wig and placed it on her head. Ryan Love of Digital Spy had a preview of the recording of the show, and commented that when [...] "it's just GaGa [...] on the piano, you can't help but be impressed." [...] Cynthia Robinson from The Huffington Post theorized that Gaga pretending to be bald was not a [...] "fashion statement", instead she was [...] "saying something about shedding that skin, that costume, that barrier that she created with all of her vaunted costumes—at least so that people <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is inside before putting it back on." ...|$|E

[...] Pascua also enjoyed Leigh's performance as Lexie, commenting: [...] "This was one episode I felt that Lexie was a genuine character. She still maintained that book-smart ability to repeat facts (like the merger cases) and shows a command of medical situations." [...] He too found Oh's bear voice comical, adding: [...] "I laughed when Cristina attempted to do her voice for Mr. Bear because you knew that she didn't <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> was doing." [...] Pascua was shocked with the departure of Utterbacks' character, writing: [...] "I can't believe that they cut Nurse Olivia. I understand that she wasn't really around, but having her as a tertiary character was nice. It was kind of ass-y of the chief not to personally tell these people {{that they were being}} cut, but it made Derek look really chivalrous." ...|$|E

However, he added that Heat {{was meant to be}} [...] "the enduring classic... this scent will re-energize the celebrity category". Consequently, five additional fragrances were released from the Heat line: Heat Ultimate Elixir, Heat Rush, Midnight Heat, Heat: The Mrs. Carter Show World Tour and Heat Wild Orchid. In 2013, it was revealed that with $400 million earned at retail globally, the line of perfumes was placed at number three on the list of best-selling fragrances. The Heat releases further became the best-selling line of celebrity endorsed fragrances. Mormois discussed his collaboration with Beyoncé on the Heat line, saying: [...] "Beyoncé has always chosen simple and strong concepts for her fragrances. She's very collaborative in that she <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> wants and she has a very clear view of her fan base. There {{are just a few of}} that qualities that make her an excellent partner. She is excellent at making decisions and making them happen." [...] In September 2011, Beyoncé followed Heat with a new line of fragrances titled Beyoncé Pulse.|$|E

I'm in Atlanta, driving home in a '92 Cadillac, and I get the call [...] I hung up and just screamed out joyous sounds."

500|$|Within the series, set {{during the}} Prohibition-era of the United States, Isaac and Miria [...] "are {{a pair of}} idiotic lovers and thieves" [...] who are portrayed as [...] "always {{enthusiastic}} and optimistic". They are often mistaken for performers because {{of the variety of}} disguises they employ during their heists, such as dressing up as mummies or as the Tramp. The duo commit a variety of eccentric robberies, including attempting to steal time by stealing watches, trying to stop anyone from entering a museum by stealing the entrance and stealing the Genoard family fortune to prevent the family from fighting over it. Miria exhibits a complete trust in Isaac and supports anything he says no matter how ridiculous it is and often goes as far to mimic his body language and his speech, although she often does not really <b>know</b> <b>what</b> <b>she</b> is saying. Although the pair are very idiotic, Isaac is not completely stupid and there are occasions that shows that he displays his inner intelligence. He is able to recognize a pair of plainclothes officers because he claims that he is familiar with their speech style. Isaac and Miria may have been born into wealthy families because they state that their parents' homes and the Genoard mansion have similar exteriors.|$|E

[...] Reviewing her performance of Ruy Blas in 1872, the critic Théodore de Banville wrote that Bernhardt [...] "declaimed like a bluebird sings, like the wind sighs, like the water murmurs."
