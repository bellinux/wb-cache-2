5|$|Along {{with many}} veterans, Waddy has {{returned}} to Arnhem frequently. When visiting in 1954 he was presented with a damaged silver cigarette case bearing his surname. When <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> cleaned at home he discovered it was a present from his father to Colonel Hilaro Barlow, another 1st Airborne officer who was killed during the battle.|$|E
5|$|This {{term was}} also used to imprecisely refer to the {{equipment}} used to perpetrate their crimes, such as gas chambers and Zyklon B. The true meaning of Sonderbehandlung was widely known in the SS, and in April 1943, Reichsführer-SS Heinrich Himmler was so concerned about the security of it that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> redacted in a secret report.|$|E
5|$|Colbert wrote The Magical Worlds of Harry Potter while {{teaching}} {{a seminar on}} self-publishing to graduate students at the University of North Carolina. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> self-published in March 2001 and hired a company {{to take care of}} accounting, marketing, promotion, and selling. Colbert has never met Rowling and the book has not been approved by her or Warner Brothers (the owner of the film rights to the Harry Potter novels). He was given permission to publish it as long as he noted on the cover that it had not been approved by Rowling.|$|E

5|$|Hennessey {{was drafted}} by the San Francisco Giants {{in the first round}} (21st overall) of the 2001 Major League Baseball draft. He began his career with the Salem-Keizer Volcanoes of the Single-A short season Northwest League, where he had a 10 record, a 2.38 ERA, 22 strikeouts, and 34 innings pitched in nine starts. That year, Salem-Keizer won the Northwest League championship. While {{pitching}} in an instructional league later that year, Hennessey began experiencing soreness that was initially attributed to a muscle strain but {{turned out to be a}} non-cancerous tumor in his back. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> removed in February 2002, but it grew back later that season, and he missed the entire year while undergoing a second surgery.|$|E
5|$|In 1950 the Dade County Planning Board {{announced}} {{a plan to}} build a highway connecting Key Biscayne with the Overseas Highway on Key Largo. The project envisioned bridges connecting artificial islands, to be built on the Safety Valve and existing small keys to Elliott Key and on to Key Largo. Áleman was expected to donate the right-of-way for a road running {{down the middle of the}} island to the first bridge at Cape Florida. With the prospect of a major highway passing through his property, Áleman rushed to prepare it for development: <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> completely cleared, leveled and filled in. A seawall was constructed along the western (Biscayne Bay) side of the Cape Florida property.|$|E
5|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} events to take place in Hyde Park was the Great Exhibition of 1851. The Crystal Palace was constructed {{on the south side of}} the park. The public did not want the building to remain after the closure of the exhibition, and its architect, Joseph Paxton, raised funds and purchased it. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> moved to Sydenham Hill in South London. Another significant event was the first Victoria Cross investiture, on 26 June 1857, when 62 men were decorated by Queen Victoria in the presence of Prince Albert and other members of the Royal Family, including their future son-in-law Crown Prince Frederick of Prussia, later Emperor Frederick III.|$|E

5|$|The Astana (Palace), {{which is}} now the {{official}} residence of the Governor of Sarawak, was constructed next to Brooke's first residence. <b>He</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> built in 1869 as a wedding gift to his wife. Kuching continued to prosper under Charles Vyner Brooke, who succeeded his father as the Third Rajah of Sarawak. In 1941, Kuching {{was the site of}} the Brooke Government Centenary Celebration. A few months later, the Brooke administration came to a close when the Japanese occupied Sarawak.|$|E
5|$|While still {{partnered with}} his brother, McNary began {{teaching}} property law at Willamette University College of Law {{in the spring}} of 1899 and courting Jessie Breyman. In 1908, he was hired as its dean to replace John W. Reynolds. As dean, he worked to enlarge the school and secure additional classroom space. He recruited prominent local attorneys to serve on the faculty and increased the size of the school from four graduates in 1908 to 36 in 1913, his last year as dean. In his drive to make Willamette's law school one of the top programs on the West Coast, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> re-located from leased space in office buildings to the university campus.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the episode}} was filmed on the Daedalus set. Due to that, visual effects were {{required}} {{to fill in the}} external shots. The episode was reportedly {{one of the most expensive}} VFX budgets in the series, and is the most expensive for the season. The star map behind the captain's chair of the Daedalus is usually lit green. However, the episode's writer and supervising producer, Alan McCullough, deliberately turned the map 90 degrees and changed the color from green to orange, so as to make the ship different from the normal Daedalus. McCullough also stated that the episode is a one-off, but did not rule out a return beyond the fifth season. He also said that he originally planned the team to visit a reality where the Ancients won the war against the Wraith, but this idea was dropped as it would detract from the main storyline. The episode was Jason Momoa's first appearance with his customised wig. After he had his hair cut by the time the fourth season was completed, for the first three episodes <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> sewn back on. However, when SCI FI wouldn't allow his hairstyle to be changed, they switched to the wig after Momoa complained about the pain of having his hair sewn on again.|$|E

5|$|On the November 16 {{episode of}} SmackDown!, Hardy and MVP dropped the WWE Tag Team Championship to John Morrison and The Miz. Despite {{the fact that}} Hardy was hurt, MVP {{immediately}} invoked the rematch clause. After the rematch, in which Hardy was forced to tap out, MVP attacked Hardy, repeatedly targeting his knee. It was later confirmed by WWE.com that Hardy had suffered an injury at his former partner's hands and {{that he might not}} be able to compete at Survivor Series. Despite his absence at the pay-per-view, his team was able to win the match. On November 21, WWE's official website reported that Hardy underwent an emergency appendectomy in Tampa, Florida. A CAT scan revealed an inflamed appendix after Hardy was feeling extreme pain. Later surgery revealed that his appendix had already burst. According to Hardy himself, on December 8 doctors back in North Carolina found an abscess of infection that had not been caught, and <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> drained, spending an additional several days in the hospital. Hardy made an appearance at the December 31 episode of Raw supporting his brother Jeff. To further Jeff's storyline with Randy Orton, however, Hardy was attacked by Orton. Hardy made his return at a live event in Muncie, Indiana on March 1, 2008.|$|E
5|$|Wilfrid {{introduced}} the Rule of Saint Benedict into the monasteries he founded. It appears {{likely that he}} was the first to introduce the Benedictine Rule into England, as evidence is lacking that Augustine's monastery at Canterbury followed the Rule. He also was one of the first Anglo-Saxon bishops to record the gifts of land and property to his church, which he did at Ripon. Easter tables, used to calculate the correct date to celebrate Easter, were brought in from Rome where the Dionysiac Easter tables had been recently introduced. He set up schools and became a religious advisor to the Northumbrian queen Æthelthryth, first wife of Ecgfrith. Æthelthryth donated the land at Hexham where Wilfrid founded a monastery and built a church using some recycled stones from the Roman town of Corbridge. When Wilfrid arrived in York as bishop the cathedral's roof was on the point of collapse; <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>it</b> repaired and covered in lead, and had glass set in the windows.|$|E
