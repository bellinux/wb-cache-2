40|$|Technical {{textiles}} play {{a highly}} {{important role in}} today's material engineering. In fibrous composites, which are being applied {{in a number of}} industrial branches ranging from aviation to civil engineering, technical textiles are used as the reinforcing or toughening constituent. With growing number of production facilities for fibrous materials, the need for standardized and reproducible quality control procedures becomes urgent. The present thesis addresses the issue of tensile strength of high-modulus multifilament yarns both from the theoretical and experimental point of view. In both these aspects, novel approaches are introduced. Regarding the theoretical strength of fibrous yarns, a model for the length dependent tensile strength is formulated, which distinguishes three asymptotes of the mean strength size effect curve. The transition between the model of independent parallel fibers applicable for smaller <b>gauge</b> <b>lengths</b> and the chain-of-bundles model applicable for longer <b>gauge</b> <b>lengths</b> is emphasized in particular. It is found that the transition depends on the stress transfer or anchorage length of filaments and can be identified experimentally by means of standard tensile tests at different <b>gauge</b> <b>lengths.</b> In the experimental part of the thesis, the issue of stress concentration in the clamping has been addressed. High-modulus yarns with brittle filaments are very sensitive to stress concentrations when loaded in tension making the use of traditional tensile test methods difficult. A novel clamp adapter for the Statimat 4 U yarn tensile test machine (producer: Textechno GmbH) has been developed and a prototype has been built. A test series comparing yarns strengths tested with the clamp adapter and with commonly used test methods has been performed and the results are discussed. Furthermore, they are compared with theoretical values using the Daniels' statistical fiber-bundle model...|$|R

5000|$|The {{specimen}} {{is placed}} in the machine between the grips and an extensometer if required can automatically record the change in <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> during the test. If an extensometer is not fitted, the machine itself can record the displacement between its cross heads on which the specimen is held. However, this method not only records the change in length of the specimen but also all other extending / elastic components of the testing machine and its drive systems including any slipping of the specimen in the grips. Once the machine is started it begins to apply an increasing load on specimen. Throughout the tests the control system and its associated software record the load and extension or compression of the specimen.|$|E
50|$|In Rayleigh scatter based {{distributed}} {{fiber optic}} sensing, a coherent laser pulse is sent along an optic fiber, and scattering sites within the fiber cause the fiber {{to act as}} a distributed interferometer with a <b>gauge</b> <b>length</b> approximately equal to the pulse length. The intensity of the reflected light is measured as a function of time after transmission of the laser pulse. This is known as Coherent Rayleigh Optical Domain Reflectometry (COTDR) When the pulse has had time to travel the full length of the fiber and back, the next laser pulse can be sent along the fiber. Changes in the reflected intensity of successive pulses from the same region of fiber are caused by changes in the optical path length of that section of fiber. This type of system is very sensitive to both strain and temperature variations of the fiber and measurements can be made almost simultaneously at all sections of the fiber.|$|E

40|$|The present work {{reports a}} {{comparative}} study of alternative models to describe the tensile strength of carbon fibers. The theoretical models were validated using data determined {{for a wide range}} of materials. Fibers derived from PAN and pitch, with different geometries (circular and ellipsoidal cross section), with and without surface treatment, were tensile tested. A mixed-modeWeibull distribution function, adapted for the length dependence of fiber strength, was used to model the tensile data, assuming the weakest link approximation. This function is capable of describing the effect of flaws and crystalline misalignment on fiber tensile strength. Additionally, the ‘end-effect’ model was employed to distinguish between these failures and those that result from the test method itself, namely the influence of the machine clamps. It was observed that the relative importance of end-effects increases as the length or the aspect ratio of the fiber decreases. For most fibers studied at longer <b>gauge</b> <b>lengths,</b> a two-parameter Weibull distribution could adequately fit the strength data. Thus, in these cases, a dominant flaw population may be responsible for fiber failure. Based on the results of this study, criteria are proposed for selecting the most appropriate statistical models to predict the tensile strength of carbon fibers at small <b>gauge</b> <b>lengths...</b>|$|R
