CORTEX, which stands for CORe monitoring Techniques and EXperimental validation and demonstration, aims at developing an innovative core monitoring technique that allows detecting anomalies in nuclear reactors, such as excessive vibrations of core internals, flow blockage, coolant inlet perturbations, etc. The technique is based on primarily using the inherent fluctuations in neutron flux recorded by <b>in-core</b> and ex-core <b>instrumentation</b> (often referred to as neutron noise), from which the anomalies will be differentiated depending on their type, location and characteristics. In addition to be non-intrusive and not requiring any external perturbation of the system, the method allows the detection of operational problems at a very early stage. Proper actions could thus be taken by utilities before such problems have any adverse effect on plant safety and reliability...|$|R

40|$|VESTA (Verification of Ex-vessel corium STAbilization) and VESTA-S (-small) test {{facilities}} were constructed at the Korea Atomic Energy Research Institute in 2010 to perform various corium melt experiments. Since then, several tests {{have been performed}} for the verification of an ex-vessel core catcher design for the EU-APR 1400. Ablation tests of an impinging ZrO 2 melt jet on a sacrificial material were performed to investigate the ablation characteristics. ZrO 2 melt in an amount of 65 – 70  kg was discharged onto a sacrificial material through a well-designed nozzle, after which the ablation depths were measured. Interaction tests between the metallic melt and sacrificial material were performed to investigate the interaction kinetics of the sacrificial material. Two types of melt were used: one is a metallic corium melt with Fe 46 %, U 31 %, Zr 16 %, and Cr 7 % (maximum possible content of U and Zr for C- 40), {{and the other is}} a stainless steel (SUS 304) melt. Metallic melt in an amount of 1. 5 – 2. 0  kg was delivered onto the sacrificial material, and the ablation depths were measured. Penetration tube failure tests were performed for an APR 1400 equipped with 61 <b>in-core</b> <b>instrumentation</b> penetration nozzles and extended tubes at the reactor lower vessel. ZrO 2 melt was generated in a melting crucible and delivered down into an interaction crucible where the test specimen is installed. To evaluate the tube ejection mechanism, temperature distributions of the reactor bottom head and <b>in-core</b> <b>instrumentation</b> penetration were measured by a series of thermocouples embedded along the specimen. In addition, lower vessel failure tests for the Fukushima Daiichi nuclear power plant are being performed. As a first step, the configuration of the molten core in the plant was investigated by a melting and solidification experiment. Approximately 5  kg of a mixture, whose composition in terms of weight is UO 2 60 %, Zr 10 %, ZrO 2 15 %, SUS 304 14 %, and B 4 C 1 %, was melted in a cold crucible using an induction heating technique...|$|E

Two adjuster rods located above the core and adjacent to the guide tube, could be clearly identified from the features of the radiation profile measurement. These measurements provide confirmatory information for the creation of safe and effective radiation work plans and selection of appropriate <b>in-core</b> <b>instrumentation.</b> This technology can be used to accurately measure the positions of irradiated reactor components, such as adjuster rods, pressure tubes, calandria tubes, reactivity control absorbers and other sources of gamma radiation inside a shut down reactor...|$|E

40|$|During {{irradiation}} {{tests at}} high temperature failure of commercial Inconel 600 sheathed thermocouples is commonly encountered. As instrumentation, in particular thermocouples are considered safety-relevant both for irradiation tests and for commercial reactors, JRC and THERMOCOAX {{joined forces to}} solve this issue by performing out-of-pile tests with thermocouples mimicking the environment encountered by high temperature reactor (HTR) <b>in-core</b> <b>instrumentation.</b> The objective was to screen innovative sheathed thermocouples which would consecutively be tested under irradiation. Two such screening tests have been performed in high temperature environment (i. e. temperature in the range 1100 – 1150 ◦C) with purposely contaminated helium atmosphere (mainly CH 4, CO, CO 2, O 2 impurities) representative for high temperature reactor carburizing atmospheres. The first set of thermocouples embedded in graphite (mainly conventional N type thermocouples and thermocouples with innovative sheaths) was tested in a dedicated furnace at THERMOCOAX lab with helium flushing. The second out-of-pile test at JRC with a partly different set of thermocouples replicated the original test for comparison. Performance indicators such as thermal drift, insulation resistance and loop resistance were monitored. Through these long-term screening tests the effect of several parameters were investigated: niobium sleeves, bending, diameter, sheath composition as well as the chemical environment. SEM examinations were performed to analyze local damage (bending zone, sheath). The present paper describes the two tests, sums up data collected during these tests in terms of thermocouple behavior and describes further instrumentation testing work with fixed point mini cells for qualification under irradiation.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{reliability}} of different noise estimators aimed at determining the Moderator Temperature Coefficient (MTC) of reactivity in Pressurized Water Reactors. By monitoring the inherent fluctuations in the neutron flux and moderator temperature, an on-line monitoring of the MTC without perturbing reactor operation is possible. In order to get an accurate estimation of the MTC by noise analysis, the point-kinetic component of the neutron noise and the core-averaged moderator temperature noise have to be used. Because of the scarcity of the <b>in-core</b> <b>instrumentation,</b> the determination of these quantities is difficult, and several possibilities thus exist for estimating the MTC by noise analysis. Furthermore, the effect of feedback has to be negligible at the frequency chosen for estimating the MTC {{in order to get}} a proper determination of the MTC. By using an integrated neutronic/thermal-hydraulic model specifically developed for estimating the three-dimensional distributions of the fluctuations in neutron flux, moderator properties, and fuel temperature, different approaches for estimating the MTC by noise analysis can be tested individually. It is demonstrated that a reliable MTC estimation can only be provided if the core is equipped with a sufficient number of both neutron detectors and temperature sensors, i. e. if the core contain in-core detectors monitoring both the axial and radial distributions of the fluctuations in neutron flux and moderator temperature. It is further proven that the effect of feedback is negligible for frequencies higher than 0. 1 Hz, and thus the MTC noise estimations have to be performed at higher frequencies...|$|E
40|$|Master of ScienceDepartment of Mechanical and Nuclear EngineeringDouglas S. McGregorFission {{chambers}} are {{a common}} type of detector {{used to determine the}} neutron flux and power of a nuclear reactor. Due to the limited space and high neutron flux in a reactor core, it is difficult to perform real-time flux measurements with present-day <b>in-core</b> <b>instrumentation.</b> Micro-pocket fission detectors, or MPFDs, are relatively small in size and have low neutron sensitivity while retaining a large neutron to gamma ray discrimination ratio, thereby, allowing them to be used as active neutron flux monitors inside a nuclear reactor core. The micro-pocket fission chamber allows for multiple detectors to be inserted into a flux port or other available openings within the nuclear reactor core. Any material used to construct the MPFD must be rugged and capable of sustaining radiation damage for long periods of time. Each calibrated MPFD provides measurements of the flux for a discrete location. The size of these detectors allows for a spatial map of the flux to be developed, enabling real-time analysis of core burnup, power peaking, and rod shadowing. Small diameter thermocouples can be included with the array to also measure the temperature at each location. The following document details the research and development of MPFDs for long term use in nuclear power reactors. Previous MPFD designs were improved, miniaturized, and optimized for long term operations in reactor test ports designed for passive measurements of fluence using iron wires. Detector chambers with dimensions of 0. 08 in x 0. 06 in x 0. 04 in were attached to a common cathode and individual anodes to construct an array of the MPFDs. Each array was tested at the Kansas State University TRIGA Mark II nuclear reactor to demonstrate functionality. The linear response in reactor power was measured. These arrays have also demonstrated reactor power tracking by following reactivity changes in steady state operations and reactor pulsing events. Stability testing showed consistent operation at 100 kW for several hours. The MPFDs have been demonstrated to be a viable technology for in-core measurements...|$|E
40|$|The Advanced Test Reactor (ATR) and the ATR Critical (ATRC) {{facilities}} lack real-time {{methods for}} detecting thermal neutron flux and fission reaction rates for irradiation capsules. Direct {{measurements of the}} actual power deposited into a test are now possible without resorting to complicated correction factors. In addition, {{it is possible to}} directly measure minor actinide fission reaction rates and to provide time-dependent monitoring of the fission reaction rate or fast/thermal flux during transient testing. A joint Idaho State University /Idaho National Laboratory ATR National Scientific User Facility (ATR NSUF) project was recently initiated to evaluate new real-time state-of-the-art in-pile flux detection sensors. Initially, the project is comparing the accuracy, response time, and long duration performance of French Atomic Energy Commission (CEA) -developed miniature fission chambers, specialized self-powered neutron detectors (SPNDs) by the Argentinean National Energy Commission (CNEA), specially developed commercial SPNDs, and back-to-back fission (BTB) chambers developed by Argonne National Laboratory (ANL). As discussed in this paper, specialized fixturing and software was developed by INL to facilitate these joint ISU/INL evaluations. Calculations were performed by ISU to assess the performance of and reduce uncertainties in flux detection sensors and compare data obtained from these sensors with existing integral methods employed at the ATRC. Ultimately, project results will be used to select the detector that can provide the best online regional ATRC power measurement. It is anticipated that project results may offer the potential to increase the ATRC’s current power limit and its ability to perform low-level irradiation experiments. In addition, results from this effort will provide insights about the viability of using these detectors in the ATR. Hence, this effort complements current activities to improve ATR software tools, computational protocols and <b>in-core</b> <b>instrumentation</b> under the ATR Modeling, Simulation and V&V Upgrade initiative, as well as the work to replace nuclear instrumentation under the ATR Life Extension Project (LEP) and provide support to the ATR NSUF...|$|E
40|$|Eperimental Breeder Reactor I. The fully ribbed {{and rigid}} Mark III loading of EBR-I {{was found to}} be govenned by {{feedback}} processes which guarantee safe and stable operation under normal operating conditions and to give a large radial contribution to the power coefficient. Nonlinearities in the power coefficient were investigated and found to be no problem. If the stabilizing ribs are removed from the fuel rode, a strong positive effect appears which is associated with the inward bowing of fuel rods. The prompt positive coefficient obseved in Mark II is discussed from the standpoint of Mark III tests. A 800 -Mwh irradiation run was made on a number of samples, and some bric cladding failures are reported. Data are given for the dimensional changes in EBR-I, Mark III fuel rods used for a total of 2, 682 Mwh operating time; the fuel rods usually increased in diameter and decreased in length, and some bowing was obseved. The growth and temperature profiles of the fuel rode are compared, and the effects of radial restraint on the rod growth are discussed. The EBR-I, Mark FV core design is then discussed. The fuel rod will incorporate four plutonium- 10 at. % aluminum fuel slugs with two depleted uranium blanket slugs. Calculations were made on the critical mass of Mark IV, which is shown to be 28. 3 kg of total plutonium. Zero-power Reactor III (ZPR-III). A mockup of EBR-II was studied in ZPR-III, and the wonth of the mockup control rods was evaluated with tantalum and B/sub 4 / C followers. An EBR-II B/sub 4 /C oscillator rod experiment was made in which the excess reactivity was measured {{as a function of the}} angular position of the oscillator. The worths of sodium, aluminum, and stainless steel were mapped throughout the core and blanket. From substitution experiments, there appears to be some spectral differences at the center of the clean cores, depending on whether the core is filled with sodium or aluminum. A two-dimensional mapping of the worth of U/sup 235 / and U/sup 238 / was also performed, and their fission rates were determined. Since the EBR-II shields and thimble holes have been redesigned, new mockups were made and their counter responses studied. Transient Reactor Test Facil 1 ty. The equipment and procedures used to obtain constant power or flat top pulse burats for transient testing of fuel elements are described. The poison sections of the control rode were modified by mixing epoxy resin with graded boron carbide to prevent poison movement. The radiation effects of pulsed bursts on pressure transducers were studied, and it was found that the extraneous pressure signal following the instantaneous power, but not that following the integrated power, can be eliminated. Boiling Reactor Experiment V (Borax V). A general review is given of work done to date, and the design of the reactor and plant is discussed in detail. The core structure is discussed, particularly the spring which allows differential expansion between the core structure and the reactor vessel. A comparison of boiling fuel rods with different diameters is given. The superheater fuel assembly was redesigned with 4 instead of 5 fuel plates because the maximum surface temperature has been lowered from 1200 to 1100 deg F. The reactor control system is compared with those of previous BORAX reactors and EBWR. The construction of the control rods is discussed; the control rod drives which are to be used are those originally used on EBWR. The fuel handling system is discussed. The programs for testing superheater-fiuel assembly seals and developing <b>in-core</b> <b>instrumentation</b> are described. Argonne Fast Source Reactor (AFSR).
