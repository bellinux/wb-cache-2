500|$|An Euler diagram is a {{diagrammatic}} {{means of}} representing sets and their relationships. Euler diagrams consist of simple closed curves (usually circles) {{in the plane}} that depict sets. [...] Each Euler curve divides the plane into two regions or [...] "zones": the interior, which symbolically represents {{the elements of the}} set, and the exterior, which represents all elements that are not members of the set. [...] The sizes or shapes of the curves are not important; the significance of the diagram is in how they overlap. The spatial relationships between the regions bounded by each curve (overlap, containment or neither) corresponds to set-theoretic relationships (intersection, subset and disjointness). [...] Curves whose interior zones do not intersect represent disjoint sets. [...] Two curves whose interior zones intersect represent sets that have common elements; the zone inside both curves represents the set of elements common to both sets (the intersection of the sets). [...] A curve that is contained completely within the <b>interior</b> <b>zone</b> of another represents a subset of it. Euler diagrams were incorporated as part of instruction in set theory as part of the new math movement in the 1960s. Since then, they have also been adopted by other curriculum fields such as reading.|$|E

40|$|The Asian <b>interior</b> arid <b>zone</b> is {{the largest}} desert landform system in the Northern Hemisphere, and has high biodiversity. Little is {{currently}} known about the evolutionary history of its biota. In this study, we used Zygophyllum, an important and characteristic component of the Asian <b>interior</b> arid <b>zone,</b> to provide {{new insights into the}} evolution of this biota. By greatly enlarged taxon sampling, we present the phylogenetic analysis of Asian Zygophyllum based on two plastid and one nuclear markers. Our phylogenetic analyses indicate that Asian Zygophyllum and Sarcozygium form a clade and Sarcozygium is further embedded within the shrub subclade. An integration of phylogenetic, biogeographic, and molecular dating methods indicates that Zygophyllum successfully colonized the Asian interior from Africa in the early Oligocene, and Asian Zygophyllum became differentiated in the early Miocene and underwent a burst of diversification in the late Miocene associated with the expansion of Asian interior arid lands due to orogenetic and climatic changes. Combining diversification patterns of other important components of the Asian <b>interior</b> arid <b>zone,</b> we propose a multi-stage evolution model for this biota: the late Eocene-early Oligocene origin, the early Miocene expansion, and the middle-late Miocene rapid expansion to the whole Asian <b>interior</b> arid <b>zone.</b> This study also demonstrates that, for Zygophyllum and perhaps other arid-adapted organisms, arid biomes are evolutionary cradles of diversity...|$|R

40|$|Habitat {{fragmentation}} due to urbanization {{is increasing}} rapidly worldwide. Although patch area and edge effect are both important determinants of species diversity {{and the number}} of individuals in fragmented landscapes, studies that tested interaction between two effects were limited. Here we examined the interaction between area and edge effects on species richness {{and the number of}} individuals of carabids in highly fragmented forests in Tokyo, central Japan. We surveyed carabids in each of 26 forest patches (1. 1 - 121. 6 ha) using pitfall traps set in both edge and <b>interior</b> <b>zones.</b> First, we correlated the edge-to-interior differences of both species richness and the number of individuals with patch area. Second, we examined the interaction between patch area and distance to the edge on species richness and the number of individuals using generalized linear models. We found a significant decrease in carabid species richness and the number of individuals in edge zones. The edge-to-interior differences in both species richness and the number of individuals were positively correlated with patch area. Model selection revealed the evident interaction effects between patch area and distance to the edge: higher number of individuals was predicted in only large <b>interior</b> <b>zones.</b> Our results indicated that carabid beetle assemblages were influenced by the interaction between area and edge effects. Thus, in urban areas where small forest remnants dominate, circularizing the shape of the forest patches to maximize the core areas may be the most feasible and realistic means to preserve biodiversity...|$|R
