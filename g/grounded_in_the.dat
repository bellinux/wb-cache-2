5|$|The second {{school of}} Vedanta is the Vishishtadvaita, {{which was founded}} by Ramanuja (1017–1137 CE). Ramanuja {{disagreed}} with Adi Shankara and the Advaita school. Visistadvaita is a synthetic philosophy bridging the monistic Advaita and theistic Dvaita systems of Vedanta. Ramanuja frequently cited the Upanishads, and stated that Vishishtadvaita is <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upanishads.|$|E
5|$|The third {{school of}} Vedanta called the Dvaita school {{was founded by}} Madhvacharya (1199–1278 CE). It is {{regarded}} as a strongly theistic philosophic exposition of Upanishads. Madhvacharya, much like Adi Shankara claims for Advaita, and Ramanuja claims for Vishishtadvaita, states that his theistic Dvaita Vedanta is <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Upanishads.|$|E

5|$|According to Eliot {{the poetic}} {{aspects of the}} poem are <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{tradition}} of John Cleveland, Edward Benlowes, William Blake, and William Butler Yeats's early work. Additionally, many of the images {{are connected to the}} poetry of Stéphane Mallarmé. In terms of theology, Eliot is orthodox in his theory and relies primarily on the writings of St Augustine. There are some additional influences from the works of Thomas Browne and Saint John of the Cross. In applying these views upon society, Eliot was heavily influenced by the writings of Christopher Dawson and Dawson's reliance on understanding God as the first step to a better society.|$|E
5|$|In {{contrast}} to Catholic allegations of rationalism and naturalism, Protestant objections {{are more likely}} to be based on allegations of mysticism, occultism, and even Satanism. Masonic scholar Albert Pike is often quoted (in some cases misquoted) by Protestant anti-Masons as an authority for the position of Masonry on these issues. However, Pike, although undoubtedly learned, was not a spokesman for Freemasonry and was also controversial among Freemasons in general. His writings represented his personal opinion only, and furthermore an opinion <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> attitudes and understandings of late 19th century Southern Freemasonry of the USA. Notably, his book carries in the preface a form of disclaimer from his own Grand Lodge. No one voice has ever spoken for the whole of Freemasonry.|$|E
5|$|Schlosberg's contribution, is, in many ways, a {{response}} to challenges made to his Defining Environmental Justice (2007). Schlosberg aims to step beyond previous accounts of animal rights or environmentalism as requirements of justice by deploying a mixed capabilities/deliberation approach applicable to both ecosystems and nonhuman animals. Schlosberg challenges criticisms of his capabilities approach (specifically, a capabilities approach which moves beyond humans) <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> existence of conflicts of capabilities, claiming that a form of deliberative democracy can overcome the problem posed by these conflicts. His mixed account, he claims, provides a form of justice appropriate for thinking about human and nonhuman individuals and collectives in the Anthropocene.|$|E

5|$|The {{hurricane}} {{damaged or}} wrecked numerous vessels. Six ships were wrecked or <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Bahamas, and the crews {{of at least}} two, the John Stanley and the Linea, had to be rescued. The steamship Santiago de Cuba left port on August 4, and began to encounter squally conditions later that afternoon. Heavy seas and a strong gale inflicted some damage on the vessel. Several ships along the eastern coast of Cuba were wrecked during the storm, leading to great uncertainty and concern regarding {{the fate of the}} Santiago. At least three vessels were lost or grounded along the Florida Keys.|$|E
5|$|The {{ship was}} torpedoed during the Japanese {{surprise}} attack on Port Arthur {{during the night}} of 8/9 February 1904 and <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> harbour entrance when she attempted to take refuge inside, as her draft had significantly deepened from {{the amount of water}} she had taken aboard after the torpedo hit. She was refloated and repaired in time to join the rest of the 1st Pacific Squadron when they attempted to reach Vladivostok through the Japanese blockade on 10 August. The Japanese battle fleet engaged them again in the Battle of the Yellow Sea, forcing most of the Russian ships to return to Port Arthur after their squadron commander was killed and his flagship damaged. Retvizan was sunk by Japanese howitzers in December after the Japanese gained control of the heights around the harbour.|$|E
5|$|Throughout Bristol's {{history the}} Avon Gorge {{has been an}} {{important}} transport route, carrying the River Avon, major roads and two railways. The Bristol Channel and Avon estuary have a very high tidal range of , second only to Bay of Fundy in Eastern Canada; and the gorge is relatively narrow and meandering, making it notoriously difficult to navigate. Several vessels have <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> gorge including the SS Demerara soon after her launch in 1851, the schooner Gipsy in 1878, the steam tug Black Eagle in 1861 and the Llandaff City.|$|E

5|$|According to Daniel Joseph Singal, Faulkner's {{literary}} style gradually {{developed from}} 19th century Victorian to modernist, with Light in August more firmly <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{tradition of the}} latter. The novel is characteristic of the modernist fascination with polaritieslight and dark, good and evilthe burden of history on the present, and the splintering of personal identity. The plot is also divided into dual currents, one focusing on Lena Grove {{and the other on}} Joe Christmas, a technique that Faulkner continued to use in other works. The narrative is not structured in any particular order, as it is often interrupted by lengthy flashbacks and constantly shifts from one character to another. This lack of organization and narrative continuity was viewed negatively by some critics. As in his other novels, Faulkner employs elements of oral storytelling, allowing different characters to lend voice to the narrative in their own distinct Southern idiom. Unlike some of the other Yoknapatawpha County novels, notably The Sound and the Fury, Light in August does not rely solely on stream-of-consciousness narration, but also incorporates dialogue and an omniscient third-person narrator that develop the story.|$|E
5|$|At {{one stop}} on the book tour {{associated}} with the publication and release of the book at the David A. Clarke School of Law of the University of the District of Columbia, Jackson's message was perceived as saying that American history can be studied as an analysis of race, but that economics and the tension between states’ rights and federal rights are the true basis of a domestic history revolving around pursuit of economic development, political power, and personal freedom. He then advanced the theory that these pursuits would most be most readily attained by adopting a set of new constitutional amendments, guaranteeing rights primarily <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Universal Declaration of Human Rights, which the U.S. has ratified. Each is discussed in a separate chapter: the rights to quality health care, housing, education, a clean environment, fair taxes, full employment, equality for women, {{and the right to}} vote.|$|E
5|$|Duperré did {{not meet}} any British ships on his journey back to the French island, {{as most of the}} British {{blockade}} squadron were engaged {{in the aftermath of the}} Invasion of Île Bonaparte, conducted during July by Commodore Rowley. With the British distracted by this amphibious operation, it was simple for Duperré to reach Grand Port on the south east coast of Île de France in spite of the small blockade squadron under Captain Samuel Pym. This narrow and well-protected anchorage was considered to be the best place to refit the battered French squadron, but in August it came under attack by a British squadron in the Battle of Grand Port. This action was a disaster for the British as their ships became <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> unfamiliar shoals of the harbour and four frigates were lost under fire from shore batteries and Duperré's squadron.|$|E

5|$|Following Königs {{return from}} the Baltic, the ship was tasked with guard duties in the North Sea and with {{providing}} support for minesweepers. König returned to the Baltic on 22 December for further training, which lasted until 8 January 1918. Another round of exercises was conducted from 23 February to 11 March. On 20 April König steamed out to assist a German patrol that was engaged with British forces. The ship {{was part of the}} force that steamed to Norway to intercept a heavily escorted British convoy on 23–25 April, though the operation was canceled when the battlecruiser Moltke suffered mechanical damage. König was briefly <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> northern harbor of the island of Helgoland on 30 May. Two months later, on 31 July, König and the rest of IIISquadron covered a minesweeping unit in the North Sea. The ship then went to the Baltic for training on 7–18 August, after which König returned to the North Sea. König conducted her last exercise in the Baltic starting on 28 September; the maneuvers lasted until 1 October.|$|E
5|$|On September23 Janet passed {{directly}} between Grenada and Carriacou in the Grenadines, killing 122people in {{the island}} chain. An airport on Grenada was covered in debris strewn by the strong winds. Eight {{people were killed in}} a small town adjacent to the airport. Strong winds were also reported to have destroyed docks and warehouses, and unroofed a hotel in St. George's, Grenada. Houses were also unroofed, and balconies of government offices in St. George's were torn off. All bridges {{in the island}}'s interior regions collapsed, and spice crops sustained heavy damage. An estimated 75% of nutmeg plantations were destroyed, along with nearly all of the island's banana and cocoa crops. Three ships were also <b>grounded</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> local harbor. In The Carenage, the waterfront region of St. George's, debris was scattered and an 820ft (250m) pier collapsed. St. Vincent was mostly destroyed, and St. Lucia suffered significant coastal damage. Over $2.8million in damages were estimated throughout the Grenadines. Farther south, in Port of Spain, a church being used as a storm shelter collapsed, killing ten people.|$|E
