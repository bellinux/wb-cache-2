500|$|Mimi bought {{volumes of}} short stories for Lennon, and her husband taught Lennon to read {{at the age of}} five by reading aloud the {{headlines}} of the Liverpool Echo. Every summer, from the age of nine until he was fifteen, she sent Lennon alone on a ten-hour bus journey to visit his Aunt Mater and cousin Stanley Parkes at their home near Loch Meadie in Durness, Scotland. Mimi also took her charge to a garden party in Calderstones Park every year, where a Salvation Army band played. She remembered Lennon pulling her by the hand to get there, saying, [...] "Hurry up Mimi – we’re going to be late". Strawberry Field, in Beaconsfield Road, was the name of a Salvation Army house that Lennon would later immortalise in the Beatles' song, [...] "Strawberry Fields Forever". She would later say: [...] "John loved his uncle George [...] I felt quite left out of that.

5000|$|Mikel Toombs of The San Diego Union-Tribune {{gave the}} album a {{negative}} review writing, [...] "An overactive arrangement and {{a mess of}} vocal mannerisms fail to hide the song's mundane nature. And Walker's singing also doesn't benefit [...] "Country Boy and City Girl," [...] a failed attempt at a Randy Travis weeper, although the utterly clichéd lyrics are even more deadly. To be fair, Walker is adept at snappy, sappy fare like [...] "I'd Say That's Right" [...] and [...] "Heart Over Head Over Heels". But most of this CD's value remains in the foldout miniposter that backs the packaging." [...] Buffalo News gave the album two stars and wrote, [...] "I wish the man well, but his music <b>just</b> <b>leaves</b> <b>me</b> cold. Yes, he occasionally turns out a clever song like [...] "One, Two, I Love You" [...] from this set, but the man consistently does the unforgivable—he sings without soul." [...] The Dallas Morning News gave the album a negative review writing the album [...] "is Mr. Walker's poorest effort to date. Opening with the instantly forgettable title cut and closing with Then What, a watered-down attempt at Jimmy Buffett-inspired calypso, Rumor Has It finds Mr. Walker abandoning all the promise that spurred his 1993 debut album for empty-headed mainstream pap.|$|R

40|$|The {{first time}} I {{came in contact}} with the works of Edgar Allan Poe must have been around 10 years ago through an audio-book at the library. I {{borrowed}} the book because of the terrifying picture of “The Black Cat” on the cover just to find that the stories on the tapes were far more terrifying than that picture. Since then I’ve read several lousy horror books and seen many awful horror movies. Usually, they <b>just</b> <b>leave</b> <b>me</b> asking myself why I make these lamentable decisions, and what it is that I am trying to obtain. I’ve started to realise that it’s probably the feeling of hearing those ghastly grim and ancient Poe stories for the first time that’s been my motive. In this essay I’m going to focus on the themes of madness and murder in Edgar Allan Poe’s work as these themes are present in many of his most powerful tales. It’s also a very significant part of his works as these are the stories that earned him his famously bad reputation. It can be argued that Poe himself purposely assisted in giving himself this reputation with the belief that it could make more people interested in his works and so increase the sales of his books. Even if this could have been the case, it’s hard to neglect that in Poe’s case it’s particularly easy to find a good number of parallels between the author and the art, and these parallels seem most obvious in his horror stories. The first chapter of this essay is therefore a short biography of Edgar Allan Poe’s life. In the second chapter I’m going to discuss the role of the dead girl that appears in several of Poe’s horror stories. In the third chapter I’m going to look at Poe’s murder stories and examine the impulses that lead to these hideous acts and in the fourth chapter I’m going to discuss Poe’s interest in blurring the line between dream and reality in his works.
