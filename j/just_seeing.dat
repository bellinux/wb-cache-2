In 2012 they released their sixth studio album, Push and Shove. During that time, she claimed, [...] "I never need to do that or want to do it again. I'm happy being in No Doubt." [...] However, after an appearance during Pharrell Williams' performance at the 2014 Coachella Valley Music and Arts Festival, Pharrell teased that the rare live appearance from Stefani was the start of a comeback effort for the singer. In July 2014, during an interview for Idolator, record producer Diplo announced that he had produced some songs for her new album. In September, during an interview for MTV News during New York Fashion Week, she confirmed to be working on a solo album and a No Doubt album, stating, [...] "I'm going into the studio tonight with Pharrell , I'm going to be writing and also <b>just</b> <b>seeing</b> what comes along my way.

Clarke Peters, star of American drama series The Wire, was cast as her estranged father in 2009. He appeared from 14 July to 11 August 2009, suffering from cancer of the splenic flexure, pancreas and abdominal wall. Jacobs was [...] "thrilled" [...] by Peters' casting, and reported that his first appearance rendered the programme's crew [...] "star-struck" [...] {{for the first time}} in her five years on the show. His appearance allowed Donna to confront her father over his abandonment of her as a child, and rendered her devastated upon learning that he had accepted his impending death. Peters assessed that his appearance had an [...] "enormous impact" [...] on Donna, explaining that his role allowed the audience to discover more about her life, as: [...] "This is a way to get into these characters rather than <b>just</b> <b>seeing</b> them as one-dimensional characters, dealing with whatever happens at Holby." [...] Producers Diana Kyle and Tony McHale intended the storyline to reveal a new side to Donna, depicting her attempting to cope, in contrast to the [...] "smiling party girl" [...] viewers were familiar with.|$|E

After the performance, Williams hinted at a possible return for the singer. In September 2014, she revealed she was writing for two records: her third solo studio album and her band No Doubt's seventh studio album. She told MTV news: [...] "At this point I'm thinking about both, I can do both. [...] And it's just an amazing time; so many opportunities. I'm going into the studio tonight with Pharrell , I'm going to be writing and also <b>just</b> <b>seeing</b> what comes along my way. I've been recording a few things." [...] In the same month, Stefani's manager Irving Azoff confirmed she was finishing the record with Williams, as well as planning to perform its lead single live on The Voice. Interscope chairman John Janick also revealed that producer Benny Blanco would be the album's executive producer and that it was slated to be released sometime in December 2014.|$|E

The first two charted on the US Billboard 200, reaching number 171 and 122, respectively. Several songs have been recorded {{with the purpose of}} a single or album release, and have not been featured on the show. For example, the song [...] "My Tidy Whities" [...] written by Tom Kenny and Andy Paley was released only for the album The Best Day Ever (2006). Kenny's inspiration for the song was [...] "underwear humor". Kenny said, [...] "Underwear humor is always a surefire laugh-getter with kids ... <b>Just</b> <b>seeing</b> a character that odd wearing really prosaic, normal, Kmart, three-to-a-pack underwear is a funny drawing ...

Edwards' photograph shows a hump above the water which, he said, remained there for five to ten minutes. According to Edwards, the photograph was independently verified by a Nessie sighting specialist {{and a group of}} US military monster experts. Edwards reportedly spent 60 hours per week on the loch aboard his boat, Nessie Hunter IV, on which he takes tourists for rides on the lake and claimed to have searched for the monster for 26 years. Edwards said, [...] "In my opinion, it probably looks kind of like a manatee, but not a mammal.

Lee has since tried to downplay this kkonminam image, saying that his character Gong-gil in the film felt like a foot chain for him so he wanted to escape from it: [...] "After my performance in The King and the Clown, I found myself at the forefront of this ‘pretty boy’ trend, whether or not that was my intention. Suddenly, people were interested in me, and there was all this praise and criticism all at the same time. Everything was just so overwhelming. I felt like I was floating on air." ...|$|E

[...] Royce also talked about it, and said: [...] "I'm excited to see this project come to fruition considering the long lapse in time between when we worked before and now.

2500|$|For {{the ending}} of the film, Iliadis {{and the rest of the}} {{creative}} team chose to include the song [...] "Dirge", by psychedelic rock band Death in Vegas. Iliadis was hoping to find something that was both [...] "ironic" [...] and [...] "innocent" [...] at the same time, given the events in the film that would precede its usage. To the director, the choice helped to illuminate the fact that nothing will be the same for this family again. Craven comments on the choice to have John Collingwood return to finish off Krug at the end. Craven explains, [...] "I also found it interesting that the Dr., whose oath 'does no harm', intentionally [...] and that it kinda shows that when seeking revenge you can become something evil yourself if you don't stop once what's been necessary is done.

2500|$|The cast of playable {{characters}} in Overwatch {{was selected to}} portray diverse representations of genders and ethnicities, including males, females, and non-human characters such as robots and a gorilla. The need for a diverse cast was important to the developers, as some of Blizzard's previous games had been criticized before for missing this mark; Metzen explained that even his daughter had asked him why all the female characters from Warcraft seemed to be only wearing swimsuits. Metzen stated: [...] "Specifically for Overwatch {{over the past year}} we've been really cognizant of that, trying not to oversexualize the female characters." [...] Kaplan explained that the industry was [...] "clearly in an age where gaming is for everybody," [...] going on to say that [...] "increasingly, people want to feel represented, from all walks of life, boys and girls, everybody. We feel indebted to do our best to honor that." [...] Michael Chu expressed that the diverse group of characters is a result of Blizzard's approach to game design, elaborating that [...] "We've tried [...] have a diverse cast of characters and diverse locations that you go through, and hopefully these characters - even beyond national diversity; <b>just</b> <b>seeing</b> their personalities, their backstories, their occupations - hopefully people will find things in common with these characters." ...|$|E

[...] This is part of the new ecology. And for the first time I saw the world in a new way.
