40|$|AbstractObjectivesTo {{develop and}} test an Integrated Gateway Model of {{behaviors}} and factors leading to subsequent positive reproductive, maternal, {{and child health}} behaviors. MethodsA secondary analysis was conducted using previously published household survey data collected from men (n= 5551; 2011) and women (n= 16144; 2011) in Nigeria and women in Egypt (n= 2240; 2004 – 2007). The number of health behaviors each potential gateway behavior predicted was assessed by multivariate regression, adjusting for potential confounders. The influence of gateway factors on gateway behaviors was tested via interaction terms. Gateway behaviors and factors were ranked {{by the number of}} health outcomes predicted, both separately and synergistically. ResultsThe key gateway behavior identified in both datasets was spousal communication about family planning, whereas the key <b>gateway</b> <b>factor</b> was exposure to family planning messages. ConclusionsThe model could facilitate innovative research and programming that in turn might promote cascades of positive behaviors in reproductive, maternal, and child health...|$|E

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} routes by which young people develop {{patterns}} of drug-using and offending behaviour. Survey data {{are used to}} assess the gateway effect ? the tendency for soft drug use to lead to subsequent hard drug use and criminal activity. We argue that apparently strong gateway effects can be due to unobservable personal characteristics which produce a spurious association between different forms of problem behaviour. After correcting statistically for these confounding <b>factors,</b> <b>gateway</b> effects appear small. This casts doubt on the view that a more relaxed policy stance on soft drugs will lead to a hard drug epidemic...|$|R
40|$|In recent years, the geodemographic {{makeup of}} some {{areas in the}} UK has been rapidly changing. For example, {{immigration}} has put more pressure on child services, {{education and health care}} in places such as Slough, Peterborough and the Thames <b>Gateway.</b> Other <b>factors</b> affecting the Thames Gateway are housing development as part of the massive regeneration and the development and legacy of the Olympic site. This region is also experiencing high population churn, uncertainty in its demographic composition and issues in matching service delivery. There are also increasing demands for building sustainable communities that can adapt to change. A key to maintaining sustainable communities is the quality of services and opportunities afforded by the social infrastructure. Where the needs of residents rapidly change due to (im) migration, social and economic mobility and transience, there needs to be robust mechanisms for compiling and updating the evidence base on which policy and planning changes must necessarily be founded. This paper proposes scenario-base small area population modelling with multiple administrative data sources as a means of evidencing change. It is being implemented in the Thames Gateway London boroughs, with funding from UrbanBuzz (www. urbanbuzz. org) to support local social infrastructure planning...|$|R
40|$|Abstract — Wireless mesh {{networks}} {{can provide}} scalable highspeed Internet access {{at a low}} cost. Fair channel access among different nodes in the wireless mesh network, however, is an important consideration that needs technological solutions before mesh networks can be widely deployed. Lack of fairness significantly decreases the throughput of nodes that are more than one hop away from mesh gateways. We propose an analytical model and use simulation studies to establish the existence of starvation in mesh networks even when we can ameliorate problems due to exposed terminals. Motivated by the inability of standard medium access control (MAC) protocols to limit starvation, we propose a modification to the MAC protocol to alleviate flow starvation. Our proposed algorithm improves the channel usage of short-term flows with nodes that are multiple hops from the <b>gateway</b> by a <b>factor</b> of 7 in some cases with a penalty of 20 % reduction in total throughput across all nodes. Our proposed algorithm also has a better performance than two other schemes {{in terms of a}} higher fairness index. I...|$|R

40|$|Taking out {{the trash}} at NASA's newly {{proposed}} Deep Space Gateway (DSG) {{will not be a}} trivial task. While not {{the most important aspect of}} planning this cislunar outpost, there are several options that should be carefully considered since they may affect the crew as well as mission mass and volume. This study extends an earlier one, which focused on waste disposal options for a Mars Transit Vehicle. In that study, gasifying and venting trash along the way was found to noticeably reduce propellant needs and launch mass, whereas keeping processed trash on board in the form of radiation shielding tiles would significantly lower the crew's radiation dose during a solar particle event. Another favorable strategy was packing trash in a used logistics module for disposal. Since the DSG does not need much propulsion to maintain its orbit and Orion will be present with its own radiation storm shelter at the <b>Gateway,</b> the driving <b>factors</b> of the waste disposal trade study are different than for the Mars mission. Besides reviewing the propulsion and radiation shielding factors, potential drivers such as mass, power, volume, crew time, and human factors (e. g. smell) were studied. Disposal options for DSG include jettison of a used logistics module containing waste after every human stay, jettison of the same logistics module after several missions once it is full, regular disposal of trash via an airlock, or gasifying waste products for easier disposal or reuse. Conversely, a heat melt compactor device could be used to remove water and stabilize trash into tiles which could be more compactly stored on board and used as radiation shielding. Equivalent system mass analysis is used to tally the benefits and costs (mass, volume, power, crew time) of each case on an equivalent mass basis. Other more subjective factors are also discussed. Recommendations are made for DSG and Mars mission waste disposal...|$|R
40|$|Section 26 of the Constitution of South Africa Act 108 of 1996 {{provides}} that housing {{is a basic}} human right {{and that the government}} must take reasonable legislative and other measures to achieve the realisation of this right. A number of measures were taken to try to resolve this socio-economic issue. A number of housing institutions were established, various pieces of legislation were passed and housing subsidies were provided. However, housing backlogs remain a challenge. In March 1994 the housing backlog was estimated between 1, 3 and 1, 8 million units. When more than a million houses were provided by 2001, the housing backlog had increased to between 2 and 3 million houses. To date subsidies in excess of R 29 billion have been spent on housing provision. A study by the Department of Housing concluded that, at the current rate of increase of housing funding vis-a-vis the growing backlog and rapid urbanisation, the household backlog will not be changed in ten years' time. The United States of America (USA) had a similar low cost housing problem, but securitisation alleviated it with the participation of government agencies Fannie Mae, Ginnie Mae and Freddie Mac. In South Africa, the NHFC tried to emulate the USA model by establishing Gateway Home Loans (Pty) Limited (Gateway) in 1999. Gateway, however, was not a success. This research investigates whether securitisation can be applied in South Africa to alleviate the low cost housing issue. The study finds that there is a credit availability gap for the low income sector earning less than R 8 000 per month because of the perceived risk of default and unwillingness by banks to lend to this sector. The increase in housing backlog that continues unabated, inadequate housing finance system to low income earners, the lessons learnt from the failure of <b>Gateway,</b> the success <b>factors</b> of the USA securitisation model and the sound and sophisticated South African financial system are the rationale for applying securitisation. A proposal of how to effectively apply securitisation to low cost housing in South Africa is provided with recommendations to revive the primary market. ...|$|R
40|$|Lipotoxicity is a {{condition}} in which fatty acids (FAs) are not efficiently stored in adipose tissue and overflow to non-adipose tissue, causing organ damages. A defect of adipose tissue FA storage capability can be the primary culprit in the insulin resistance condition that characterizes many of the severe metabolic diseases that affect people nowadays. Obesity, in this regard, constitutes the <b>gateway</b> and risk <b>factor</b> of the major killers of modern society, such as cardiovascular disease and cancer. A deep understanding of the pathogenetic mechanisms that underlie obesity and the insulin resistance syndrome is a challenge for modern medicine. In the last twenty years of scientific research, FA metabolism and dysregulations have been the object of numerous studies. Development of more targeted and quantitative methodologies is required on one hand, to investigate and dissect organ metabolism, on the other hand to test the efficacy and mechanisms of action of novel drugs. The combination of functional and anatomical imaging is an answer to this need, since it provides more understanding and more information than we have ever had. The first {{purpose of this study was}} to investigate abnormalities of substrate organ metabolism, with special reference to the FA metabolism in obese drug-naïve subjects at an early stage of disease. Secondly, trimetazidine (TMZ), a metabolic drug supposed to inhibit FA oxidation (FAO), has been for the first time evaluated in obese subjects to test a whole body and organ metabolism improvement based on the hypothesis that FAO is increased at an early stage of the disease. A third objective was to investigate the relationship between ectopic fat accumulation surrounding heart and coronaries, and impaired myocardial perfusion in patients with risk of coronary artery disease (CAD). In the current study a new methodology has been developed with PET imaging with 11 C-palmitate and compartmental modelling for the non-invasive in vivo study of liver FA metabolism, and a similar approach has been used to study FA metabolism in the skeletal muscle, the adipose tissue and the heart. The results of the different substudies point in the same direction. Obesity, at the an early stage, is associated with an impairment in the esterification of FAs in adipose tissue and skeletal muscle, which is accompanied by the upregulation in skeletal muscle, liver and heart FAO. The inability to store fat may initiate a cascade of events leading to FA oversupply to lean tissue, overload of the oxidative pathway, and accumulation of toxic lipid species and triglycerides, and it was paralleled by a proportional growth in insulin resistance. In subjects with CAD, the accumulation of ectopic fat inside the pericardium is associated with impaired myocardial perfusion, presumably via a paracrine/vasocrine effect. At the beginning of the disease, TMZ is not detrimental to health; on the contrary at the single organ level (heart, skeletal muscle and liver) it seems beneficial, while no relevant effects were found on adipose tissue function. Taken altogether these findings suggest that adipose tissue storage capability should be preserved, if it is not possible to prevent excessive fat intake in the first place...|$|R
