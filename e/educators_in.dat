25|$|EPI has {{developed}} several software products to support <b>educators.</b> <b>In</b> 2006, EPI developed the Institutional Student Retention Assessment (ISRA), {{which serves as}} a web-based campus audit system focused on student retention. The ISRA was developed with funding from Lumina Foundation for Education. That same year, with support from TG, EPI created the Effective Practices in Student Success (EPSS) database. The EPSS currently includes 141 programs from across the US and Canada with evidence-based strategies for postsecondary access and success. In 2007, EPI created the Retention Calculator, which calculates the benefit-cost of saving or losing students in higher education institutions and systems. EPI unveiled the EPI-DAS in 2009, a longitudinal data management system {{that can be used in}} conjunction with GEAR UP and other education initiatives to track individual students, collect and analyze data, and generate reports based on findings. EPI-DAS is designed to meet the reporting requirements of the federal government under the No Child Left Behind Act.|$|E
25|$|The Tinkering Studio {{began in}} 2008 as an {{in-house}} program geared towards maker culture and a “think with your hands” approach. It is housed within {{the museum in}} a dedicated space in the South Gallery, where it runs free do-it-yourself activities for museum visitors; it also shares its work with a larger audience of <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> afterschool programs, schools, museums and other learning environments. It is being cited as a prototype for similar programs across the globe, including South Korea, Canada, India, and Saudi Arabia. The Exploratorium also operates as afterschool tinkering program in partnership with San Francisco chapters of the Boys and Girls Club. In 2012 the Exploratorium was awarded a grant to create the California Tinkering Network, {{in collaboration with the}} Community Science Workshops, Techbridge, the Discovery Science Center, the California Afterschool Network, and the California STEM Learning Network. These organizations partner with over 20 local afterschool or summer programs to provide STEM-enriched activities for children in underserved communities. The initiative was designed to test an adaptable model for providing tinkering activities to promote learning and development in an afterschool setting.|$|E
25|$|During the French Protectorate, {{the goals}} of Tunisian <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> general developed, so as to include more the {{introduction}} of modern fields of study, namely, those leading toward the utilitarian knowledge practiced in Europe. Accordingly, in France such skills were well known, and a French technical vocabulary entered working use in Tunisia for various Protectorate projects, commercial and industrial. The French language was the favored medium in new schools {{set up by the}} French Church, initially established primarily for children of French settlers, such as Collège Saint-Charles de Tunis in 1875. Yet many urban Tunisians also sought for their children learning opportunities oriented to the acquisition of modern skills useful in the workplace. The Tunisian elites struggled against Protectorate resistance to such access. Over time, and not without contested issues, a new educational regime was created, including instruction in French open to Tunisians. This took place in the political context of the Protectorate, of course, affecting the existing Muslim institutions of learning, secular Tunisian advancement, and the instruction of young French colons.|$|E

25|$|Much of Alon Shvut's {{growth has}} been tied to the {{presence}} of Yeshivat Har Etzion. In addition to the families of faculty, many of its students have made their homes in the town. The yeshiva, housed in a large, white building overlooking the valley, also attracts many English-speaking students from around the world. Its founders are considered of the more moderate <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> the Hesder Yeshiva program and have gained a reputation of tolerance and modernity for the institute. Alon Shvut rabbinical school encouraged the family of a yeshiva student killed in a Tel Aviv Hamas bus bombing incident to donate his organs, and a Palestinian girl was the recipient of his liver. The teachers are respected authorities on biblical commentary, traditional law and Jewish philosophy. Herzog College for Teachers is located in Alon Shvut. Tsomet Institute is a research institute based in Alon Shvut that seeks ways of reconciling Jewish law with modern technology to enable hospitals, police, fire departments, and the military to carry out their duties on Sabbath.|$|E
500|$|The old University of Chicago, {{not officially}} {{connected}} with the present University of Chicago, was founded by {{a small group of}} Baptist <b>educators</b> <b>in</b> 1856 through a land endowment from Senator Stephen A.

Local Baptist congregations secured donations to help partially finance construction of the elaborate Gothic-style building, named Douglas Hall, in 1857, with loans collateralized against the Douglas land used to secure the balance.|$|E
