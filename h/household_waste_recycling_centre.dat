Sites are now handling significant volumes of recyclables (66 % of total household recyclables), and the transport impacts associated with increasing visitor numbers to HWRCs are of interest to traffic managers and land use planners. The transport logistics associated with servicing sites, including the collection, treatment and disposal of different materials, is complex. The reduction in landfill disposal coupled to more stringent requirements for material recycling and treatment has resulted in short journeys from HWRCs to landfill being replaced by complex road trips to different facilities at various locations. The operational, environmental and social impacts associated with these potential increases in commercial transport activities can be quantified through modelling current and projected fleet operations under various future scenarios. This can be achieved through routing and scheduling applications, which can be used to optimise transportation fleets and identify the optimal locations for waste treatment facilities. This paper provides an overview of the literature, identifying the transport arisings associated with the movement of waste to HWRCs by site users, and from HWRCs to treatment or disposal facilities by service operators. It also discusses the potential impacts on waste transportation from current and impending legislation, and the use of routing and scheduling applications to maximise commercial service vehicle operating efficiency...|$|R

Understanding such variability is a prerequisite to achieving best operational practices, to minimise the number of vehicle movements between each HWRC and disposal sites, and achieve consequential environmental and traffic benefits. The method described can help to quickly identify sites that are producing significantly lighter bins, enabling detailed back-end analyses to be efficiently targeted and best practice in HWRC operation identified. Tested on weigh ticket data obtained from nine HWRCs across West Sussex, the model suggested that compaction technique, vehicle type, month and site design explained 76 % of the variability in the observed nett amenity weights. For each factor, a weighting coefficient was calculated to generate a predicted nett weight for each bin transaction and Bognor Regis, Crawley and East Grinstead were identified as having similar characteristics but returning significantly different mean nett bin weights. Waste and site audits were then conducted at the three sites to try and determine the possible sources of the remaining variability.

This study consisted of two surveys carried out in order to establish how to maximise <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>recycling</b> at the 26 HWRCs in Lancashire. A telephone survey was carried out amongst all Lancashire's HWRC attendants in order to establish the effects of recent site improvements and to provide an indication of overall customer satisfaction. An on-site questionnaire survey was conducted amongst HWRC customers on five selected sites, over three separate seasons, incorporating comparative weekend and weekday surveys at each site. This survey investigated public opinion of HWRCs in Lancashire, as well as exploring effective methods that would assist customers in maximising the amount of recycling at HWRCs. The attendants' survey revealed that site attendants were actively encouraging customers to segregate waste more efficiently at the HWRCs, and that a recycling-related bonus scheme had provided an incentive towards this effort. Site attendants have a key role in educating the public about waste segregation and the effective use of HWRCs. Lancashire HWRC users were mostly male, used private cars to transport waste and showed high levels of customer satisfaction. Practical changes to encourage more recycling at HWRCs were clearly identified in the customers' survey; these include longer opening hours and the provision of boxes to enable pre-separation of waste. The study has clearly shown how the results of user surveys can provide practical assistance in the development of improved sustainable waste management strategies...|$|R

40|$|Traditionally, {{recycling}} {{service is}} provided by the government as the public service which includes kerbside collection, bring sites, <b>household</b> <b>waste</b> <b>recycling</b> <b>centres</b> and so forth. However, in today’s world facing increasing pressure from the environment, the engagement of business in recycling activities is desired. The development of technology has generated various modern recycling solutions. These new solutions allow the improvement in recycling effectiveness while enabling business to engage in the society’s recycling activities. One of these new recycling solutions is reverse vending machine (RVM). Stojanov (2015) defined this machine as ‘a device designed properly to identify and process empty beverage containers and to provide a means for a deposit refund on returnable containers’. Nowadays, there have been over 100, 000 RVMs globally of which the most are in Europe and North America (RVC, 2014 c; Sumitomo Corporation, 2008). Meanwhile, RVM has been widely considered as a simple, effective and cleaning recycling solution (Vending International, 2010). As {{one of the most influential}} countries in the world, the UK is currently facing challenges in improving its recycling performance. However, the UK still prefer traditional recycling solutions while new solutions such as RVMs remain relatively unpopular in this country. This paper will investigate the application of RVMs in the UK and try to explore the reasons of the machine’s limited employment in this country. In this paper, through case-based research, 28 UK RVM projects will firstly be presented aiming to provide a general understanding of RVMs’ application status in the UK. Next, the paper hypothesises that the reasons for RVM’s limited application derive from the impact of Deposit Refund System (DRS), awareness of RVM’s benefits, the impact of the public’s recycling attitudes and behaviours, the impact of the UK RVM projects’ operational practices, the impact of the UK’s recyclables market condition. Comparison with other countries where RVMs are more popular will be made.

Two public surveys of Hampshire residents were used {{to collect data on}} their preparedness for and awareness of the switchover and its implications. The survey also sought to establish the quantities of televisions (TVs) and TV related devices that are ready for the DSO. The quantities of TV and related devices that are likely to be disposed via HCC’s collection network have been established and compared to the County’s current handling capacities for waste electronic and electrical equipment (WEEE). Best and worst case potential net disposal scenarios have been established and the latter compared to Government projections. In addition, the potential environmental, logistical, financial and legal impacts of the WEEE arising {{as a consequence of the}} switchover have been identified and discussed. The results indicate that the majority of TVs both in Hampshire and the UK are digital ready and that awareness of the switchover is high. In contrast, most recording devices in Hampshire are not ready for the DSO. Awareness of the timeframe of the event remains modest however and about half of Hampshire households were not aware that TV recording devices will be affected by the switchover. A significant proportion of waste TVs and related equipment would be taken to HWRCs in contrast to smaller items such as remote controls that would more likely be disposed with normal <b>household</b> <b>waste.</b> Projected figures for the DSO year show that if Hampshire maintained its current collection capacity for WEEE it would experience a handling shortfall of around ? 100 K for TVs and recording devices, respectively. The most important finding of the study is that the UK Government may have substantially underestimated the quantities of TV and related devices that will be disposed during the switchover. The potential impacts for local and national WEEE management have been discussed. The paper concludes by making recommendations to address identified issues...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} two interdisciplinary {{waste management}} case studies coordinated by the University of Southampton. The first case study addresses {{the issue of}} algal species composition in wastewater treatment facilities situated in Kazakhstan. Algal populations in four experimental waste stabilisation ponds fed at surface loading rates from 50 - 300 kg BOD ha- 1 day- 1 were monitored for seven months, including a period between late November and mid March when the ponds were frozen. Cell counts and species identification were performed {{five times a week}} and biomass concentration was estimated weekly. During winter only very small numbers of algae were observed in samples taken from below the ice. Once the ice melted there was a rapid increase in algal numbers linked with rising water temperature. It was also apparent that cell numbers increased at a faster rate in the pond with the lightest winter load. During the whole period of operation the algal population was dominated by a small number of species, with 80 % of the cell count attributable to no more than 3 species in each pond, but there were considerable differences between ponds. When considered as biomass rather than cell numbers, single species dominance was even more apparent apart from in one pond where diversity increased significantly. In line with other studies, there is an indication that higher loadings result in lower diversity. With the current set of results, it was difficult to interpret changes in the population structure as a function of loading or any other analytical determinant. However, there is an indication that the system appears to be dominated by small species in the initial warm up period, maturing to greater species diversity, and larger species, by mid summer. The second case study describes a project set up to understand, quantify and model energy usage associated with the collection, separation, processing and disposal of Municipal Solid Wastes. It illustrates the energy footprint analysis using data on the paper/card fraction within <b>household</b> <b>waste.</b> The mass and energy balances for the different processes/stages involved with dealing with the waste stream in Southampton are simulated using a specially designed model. The model starts from the point where the material becomes ‘waste’ and follows it through until disposal and/or processing. It accounts for recycling via bring-sites (both <b>recycling</b> banks and <b>Household</b> <b>Waste</b> <b>Recycling</b> <b>Centres)</b> and also via kerbside collection schemes, and disposal via landfill and thermal recovery of heat. Critically, the model not only takes into account the energy consumed during processing/disposal but also transport energy consumption. The results show that the major source of energy savings from paper/card recycling is from increased use of the recycled material in paper/card manufacture, due to the decrease in energy required to produce paper from this material. There is an ~ 5 % reduction at a maximum recycling rate of ~ 52 %, compared to the present-day rate (18. 1 %,) with recycling through the PaperChain? scheme (only collects newspaper/magazines/leaflets). The savings increase to ~ 9 % (at ~ 87 % recycling rate) if a city-wide dry recyclables scheme is introduced to replace the PaperChain scheme. This increase is largely {{due to the fact that}} more sub-categories of paper/card are collected by the dry recyclables scheme. In terms of energy consumption, incineration without recycling would be the preferred waste management option. However, the calorific value of the residual waste stream is not significantly affected by removal of paper/card through increased recycling. Thus, a combination of recycling and incineration of the residual waste would also be an option...|$|R
