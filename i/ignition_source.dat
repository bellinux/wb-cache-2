5|$|Like many powders, {{dysprosium}} powder {{may present}} an explosion hazard when {{mixed with air}} and when an <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> is present. Thin foils of the substance can also be ignited by sparks or by static electricity. Dysprosium fires cannot be put out by water. It can react with water to produce flammable hydrogen gas. Dysprosium chloride fires, however, can be extinguished with water, while dysprosium fluoride and dysprosium oxide are non-flammable. Dysprosium nitrate, Dy(NO3)3, is a strong oxidizing agent and will readily ignite on contact with organic substances.|$|E

5|$|Immediately {{after the}} fire, NASA convened the Apollo 204 Accident Review Board to {{determine}} the cause of the fire, and both houses of the United States Congress conducted their own committee inquiries to oversee NASA's investigation. The <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> of the fire was determined to be electrical, and the fire spread rapidly due to combustible nylon material, and the high pressure, pure oxygen cabin atmosphere. The astronauts' rescue was prevented by the plug door hatch, which could not be opened against the higher internal pressure of the cabin. A failure to identify the test as hazardous (because the rocket was unfueled) led to the rescue being hampered by poor emergency preparedness.|$|E
25|$|Some {{additional}} precautions {{are necessary}} where ethane is stored as a cryogenic liquid. Direct contact with liquid ethane {{can result in}} severe frostbite.

25|$|Experts soon {{agreed that}} the cause was a {{hydrogen}} explosion. Almost certainly the hydrogen was formed inside the reactor vessel because of falling water levels exposing zircaloy structures/fuel assembly cladding, which then reacted with steam and produced hydrogen, with the hydrogen subsequently vented into the containment building. When the hydrogen reached ignition concentration in {{the air of the}} secondary containment building, an <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> such as a spark triggered a hydrogen-oxygen explosion, blowing out the walls of this building from the inside.|$|E
25|$|The {{official}} {{explanation for}} the explosion and subsequent crash of TWA Flight 800 is that an explosive fuel/air mixture was created {{in one of the}} aircraft's fuel tanks. Faulty wiring then provided an <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> within the tank, destroying the airliner. While the accuracy of the official findings is still questioned in this case, similar explosions have occurred in other aircraft. It is possible to reduce the chance of fuel tank explosions by a fuel tank inerting system or fire fighting foam in the tanks.|$|E

25|$|In {{addition}} to Ground Fault Circuit Interrupters (GFCIs), Arc-fault circuit interrupter devices (AFCI) are equally important as they offer added protection from potentially hazardous arc-faults resulting from damage in branch circuit wiring {{as well as}} extensions to branches such as appliances and cord sets.

25|$|The {{scientific}} {{consensus is}} that the explosion {{was caused by the}} impact of a small asteroid; however, there are a few dissenters. Astrophysicist Wolfgang Kundt has proposed that the Tunguska event was caused by the release and subsequent explosion of 10 million tons of natural gas from within earth's crust. The basic idea is that natural gas leaked out of the crust and then rose to its equal-density height in the atmosphere; from there, it drifted downwind, in a sort of wick, which eventually found an <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> such as lightning. Once the gas was ignited, the fire streaked along the wick, and then down to the source of the leak in the ground, whereupon there was the explosion.|$|E

25|$|A second fire {{incident}} {{took place}} in August 2012 when a Karma caught fire while stopped at a parking lot in Woodside, California. According to Fisker engineers, the area of origin for the fire {{was determined to be}} outside the engine compartment, as the fire was located at the driverâ€™s side front corner of the car. The evidence suggested that the <b>ignition</b> <b>source</b> was not the lithium-ion battery pack, new technology components or unique exhaust routing. The investigation conducted by Fisker engineers and an independent fire expert concluded that the cause of the fire was a low temperature cooling fan located at the left front of the Karma, forward of the wheel. An internal fault caused the fan to fail, overheat and started a slow-burning fire. Fisker announced a voluntary recall on all Karmas sold to replace the faulty fan and install an additional fuse.|$|E
