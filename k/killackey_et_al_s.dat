Statement of Problem The {{purpose of}} this study was to examine the {{validity}} of Kraska <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> ???<b>s</b> theory that SWAT teams expanded across the United States because they embodied a militaristic entity that gave an impression of an elite status symbol. The study also attempted to identify alternative influences both internal and external that may have played a role in the expansion of SWAT teams across the United States. Sources of Data The researcher conducted in-depth interviews asking twenty questions to retired law enforcement individuals during the adoption and expansion of SWAT teams. These individuals either had worked with SWAT teams or had direct knowledge of SWAT. Conclusions Reached The research findings are consistent with Kraska <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> ???<b>s</b> explanation that SWAT expanded across the United States because they embodied a militaristic entity that gave an impression of an elite status. However, the research also supports the conclusion that the expansion of SWAT was more complex than the process described by Kraska <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> and that it reflected numerous influences both internal and external to law enforcement.

40|$|Ab-initio {{molecular}} dynamics. For the ab-initio {{molecular dynamics}} (AIMD) calculations the carbon atoms were modeled with Projector Augmented-Wave potentials (S 1, S, 2) {{that included the}} 2 s and 2 p electrons in the valence. The plane-wave cut-off energy was 500 eV. The exchange and correlation was modeled in the generalized gradient approximation with the Perdew-Burke-Ernzerhof functional (S 3). The molecular dynamics were performed in the Born-Oppenheimer approximation with a time step of 1 femtosecond. We note that convergence tests were run with 0. 5 femtosecond time steps and plane-wave cut-off energy of 1000 eV. Changes to thermodynamic and shock properties for these convergence tests were less than 0. 25 %. Typical simulations ran several thousand time steps leading to simulated runtimes of several picoseconds and well-converged thermodynamic averages. The electronic states were populated with Fermi statistics at the same temperature as the ions. Following the earlier work of Correa, <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>S</b> 4), three phases of carbon were considered: diamond, bc 8, and liquid. The diamond and liquid calculations had 216 atoms in a simple cubic super cell. The bc 8 calculations had 128 atoms in a cubic super cell. The Brillouin zone was sampled with a single k-point at Baldereschi’s mean-value point (S 5) for the simple cubic cell. In contrast to the coexistence method employed by Correa, <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>S</b> 4), {{the location of the}} phase boundaries was explored using the hysteresis method of Luo, <b>et</b> <b>al.</b> (<b>S</b> 6). It was our experience that the hysteresis method (S 6) offers considerable advantages in efficiency over the coexistence method (S 4) in obtaining a reasonably good approximation to the phase boundary, but it is probably somewhat less precise because of the statistical nature of the phase transitions, particularly on cooling to a solid. Several factors influence the accuracy and precision of the AIMD calculations, only some of which have been discussed explicitly here. For a more complete discussion of th...|$|R
