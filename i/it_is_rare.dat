5|$|The serval is {{confined}} to Africa – <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> in northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in southern Africa, where their range is reportedly expanding. In northern Africa, the serval is known only from Morocco and has been reintroduced in Tunisia, but is feared to be extinct in Algeria.|$|E
5|$|While <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> to use {{units of}} amount of {{substance}} other than the mole, the Avogadro constant can also be expressed in units such as the pound mole (lb-mol) and the ounce mole (oz-mol).|$|E
5|$|A {{motto is}} a short phrase usually {{appearing}} below the shield as a statement of belief. Catholic bishops and Presbyterian churches use a motto in their arms, though <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> among Anglican bishops. A notable exception is the motto on the coat of arms of Rowan Williams, former Archbishop of Canterbury.|$|E

5|$|A primary {{spontaneous}} pneumothorax (PSP) tends {{to occur in}} a young adult without underlying lung problems, and usually causes limited symptoms. Chest pain and sometimes mild breathlessness are the usual predominant presenting features. People who are affected by PSPs are often unaware of potential danger and may wait several days before seeking medical attention. PSPs more commonly occur during changes in atmospheric pressure, explaining to some extent why episodes of pneumothorax may happen in clusters. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> for PSPs to cause tension pneumothoraces.|$|E
5|$|Although <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> on Earth, helium is {{the second}} most {{abundant}} element in the known Universe (after hydrogen), constituting 23% of its baryonic mass. The vast majority of helium was formed by Big Bang nucleosynthesis one to three minutes after the Big Bang. As such, measurements of its abundance contribute to cosmological models. In stars, it is formed by the nuclear fusion of hydrogen in proton-proton chain reactions and the CNO cycle, part of stellar nucleosynthesis.|$|E
5|$|B.brownii occurs {{naturally}} only in two population clusters between Albany and the Stirling Range {{in southwest}} Western Australia. In the Stirling Range it occurs among heath on rocky mountain slopes; further south it occurs among jarrah woodland in shallow nutrient-poor sand. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> and endangered {{in its natural}} habitat, with all major populations currently threatened by Phytophthora cinnamomi dieback, a disease to which the species is highly susceptible. Other threats include loss of habitat, commercial exploitation and changes to the fire regime.|$|E

2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> in nuns, {{except for}} those who had been sexually active before {{entering}} the convent. (Rigoni in 1841) ...|$|R
50|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> in {{any country}} until it became fashionable in West Germany, Austria and Switzerland in the 1950s to 1970s.|$|R
5|$|In Europe, {{it is one}} of 32 {{threatened}} species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention. It has been recorded from Czechoslovakia, and Poland, where it is mostly found in old-growth forests. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> in northern Europe, where it has been found in Finland growing on Picea abies and Alnus incana, and in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|In November 2012, {{shortly after}} {{entering}} office, Rivers {{was appointed to}} the Republican leadership as the minority whip. When the Majority Coalition Caucus was formed, taking control of the Senate away from the Democrats, Rivers was promoted to majority whip. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> for a freshman senator to be appointed to party leadership.|$|E
5|$|In {{continental}} Europe, C. graminis {{is widespread}} from Scandinavia to the Mediterranean Sea. It {{may also be}} found in central Asia and China. In Russia it may be found in the tundra zone from the Polar Urals to the Kolyma River, and in the nearby countries of Kazakhstan, and Mongolia. It is listed as vulnerable in Austria, Denmark, Sweden and Norway, and in Germany <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> in one district, endangered in another.|$|E
5000|$|Topazolite: Yellow-green {{in color}} and {{sometimes}} of high enough quality to be cut into a faceted gemstone, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rarer</b> than demantoid.|$|R
50|$|Niwa became {{ambassador}} to China in July 2010. His appointment <b>was</b> unusual as <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> for a businessperson {{to hold the}} position.|$|R
50|$|This {{arrangement}} provided most of {{the agricultural}} labour throughout the Middle Ages. Slavery persisted right through the Middle Ages, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rare.</b>|$|R
5|$|In the American federalist system, {{citizens}} are usually subject to {{three levels of}} government: federal, state, and local. The local government's duties are commonly split between county and municipal governments. In almost all cases, executive and legislative officials are elected by a plurality vote of citizens by district. There is no proportional representation at the federal level, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> at lower levels.|$|E
5|$|It {{is common}} {{through much of}} its range, but in the northernmost areas <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare,</b> since it is {{vulnerable}} to hard winters, especially if its feeding is disrupted by an ice glaze on the trees or freezing rain. It is also uncommon in Turkey and the Caucasus. In the west of its range it has spread to the Outer Hebrides in Scotland, pushed further north in Norway, and first bred in the Netherlands in 1993.|$|E
5|$|Neuroblastoma is {{the most}} common cancer in babies and the third most common cancer in {{children}} after leukemia and brain cancer. About 1 in every 7,000 children is affected at some point in time. About 90% of cases occur in children less than 5 years old and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> in adults. Of cancer deaths in children about 15% are due to neuroblastoma. The disease was first described in the 1800s.|$|E

50|$|Green clay has a color {{similar to}} duck egg shell, and appears off-white after firing. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rarer</b> than purple clay, and more {{expensive}} on the market.|$|R
50|$|The scarlet myzomela {{is found}} from Cooktown in Far North Queensland {{down the east}} coast to Mitchell River National Park in Gippsland, Victoria. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rarer</b> south of the Hacking River in New South Wales. Its range extends inland to Charters Towers, Carnarvon Gorge and Inglewood in Queensland, and the Warrumbungles in New South Wales. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> a <b>rare</b> vagrant to Melbourne.|$|R
5|$|Officials from Trinidad and Tobago {{reported}} that Joyce made landfall in that country. The National Hurricane Center differs, not attributing any landfall to Joyce. If Joyce really made landfall on Tobago, {{it would have}} been the first tropical storm to do so since 1990's Arthur. In addition, Joyce moved south of west for a time at a location where <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> for tropical cyclones to do so.|$|E
5|$|The Atlantic torpedo {{is widely}} {{distributed}} in cool waters {{on both sides}} of the Atlantic Ocean. In the east, it is found from northern Scotland to the Gulf of Guinea, including the entire Mediterranean Sea (but not the Black Sea), the Azores, and Madeira, as well as from Namibia to western South Africa. In the west, it occurs from southern Nova Scotia to Venezuela and Brazil. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> in the North Sea and the Mediterranean and south of North Carolina.|$|E
5|$|The serval prefers {{areas with}} cover such as reeds and tall grasses and {{proximity}} to water bodies, such as wetlands and savannahs. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> in northern Africa and the Sahel, but widespread in southern Africa. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature and Natural Resources (IUCN) classifies the serval as least concern. It occurs in protected areas across its range, and hunting of servals is either prohibited or regulated in several countries.|$|E
50|$|Since {{the song}} was not {{connected}} to an album <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> until recently when <b>it</b> <b>was</b> released on compilation albums such as Collection in 2002 and The Platinum Collection in 2006.|$|R
50|$|Iiwi was {{formerly}} {{classified as a}} near threatened species by the IUCN, but recent research has proven that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rarer</b> than previously believed. Consequently, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> uplisted to vulnerable status in 2008.|$|R
50|$|Jane Anger was an English {{author of}} the sixteenth century and the first woman to publish a {{full-length}} defense of her gender in English. The title of her defense, Jane Anger Her Protection For Women was published in 1589. In the late sixteenth century, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> for women to write and publish on secular, or non-religious, themes. And <b>it</b> <b>was</b> also <b>rare</b> for women to argue against male supremacy.|$|R
5|$|Concentric castles {{were widely}} copied across Europe, for {{instance}} when Edward I of England– who had himself been on Crusade– built castles in Wales {{in the late}} 13thcentury, four of the eight he founded had a concentric design. Not all {{the features of the}} Crusader castles from the 13thcentury were emulated in Europe. For instance, it was common in Crusader castles to have the main gate in the side of a tower and for there to be two turns in the passageway, lengthening the time it took for someone to reach the outer enclosure. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> for this bent entrance to be found in Europe.|$|E
5|$|Endemic to Africa, the bohor reedbuck is {{native to}} Benin, Burkina Faso, Burundi, Cameroon, Central African Republic, Chad, Democratic Republic of Congo, Ethiopia, Gambia, Ghana, Guinea, Guinea-Bissau, Kenya, Mali, Mauritania, Niger, Nigeria, Rwanda, Senegal, Sudan, Tanzania and Togo. The animal is {{possibly}} extinct in Ivory Coast and Uganda. Formerly widespread in western, central and eastern Africa, its present range extends from Senegal {{in the west to}} Ethiopia in the east. Among the three reedbuck species, bohor reedbuck is the most widespread in Tanzania. Its status in Burundi, Eritrea, Ghana and Togo is uncertain, while <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare</b> in Niger and Nigeria.|$|E
5|$|In North American waters, the finetooth shark {{is common}} and found from North Carolina to the {{northern}} Gulf of Mexico, and very occasionally straying {{as far north as}} New York. In Central and South American waters, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>rare,</b> but may occur more widely than presently known, having been reported off Trinidad and Guyana, infrequently from the Caribbean Sea, and off southern Brazil from São Paulo to Santa Catarina. The northwestern Atlantic, Gulf of Mexico, and South America populations are distinct, with little interchange between them. Old records exist of this species in the eastern Atlantic off Senegal and Guinea-Bissau, but these likely represent misidentifications of spinner sharks (C. brevipinna).|$|E
25|$|Robinson is also {{noteworthy}} for his harmonious {{relationship with}} Tim Duncan. Sportswriter Chris Sheridan noted that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> {{for someone like}} Robinson to have welcomed and mentored Duncan as willingly as he did.|$|R
5000|$|Prior to Hill Street Blues <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> for American {{straight}} {{drama series}} to have story arcs, i.e. several stories running over many episodes (with {{the exception of}} prime time soap operas such as Dallas). <b>It</b> <b>was</b> also <b>rare</b> to have a large regular cast. The structure of the modern [...] "ensemble" [...] television drama {{can be traced to}} Bochco, who many regard as having changed the [...] "language" [...] of television drama.|$|R
2500|$|<b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>rare</b> {{for anyone}} with a {{disability}} to get elected to Parliament but his blindness during war service brought him {{a great deal of}} personal sympathy. He held the seat at the 1923 general election ...|$|R
