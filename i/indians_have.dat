Progressive Field {{is one of the}} few {{facilities}} in baseball history to host the Major League Baseball All-Star Game and games of the World Series in the same season, which occurred in 1997. The <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> hosted games of the American League Championship Series in five seasons and have advanced to the World Series three times at the park.|$|E
5|$|The <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> made 11 {{selections}} in the supplemental {{round of}} the draft and 15 compensatory picks since {{the institution of the}} First-Year Player Draft in 1965. These additional picks are provided when a team loses a particularly valuable free agent in the previous off-season, or, more recently, if a team fails to sign a draft pick from the previous year. The <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> failed to sign three of their first-round picks: John Curtis (1966), Calvin Murray (1989), and Alan Horne (2001). The Indians received no compensation for failing to sign Curtis, but received the 39th pick in 1990 and the 41st pick in 2002 for failing to sign Murray and Horne, respectively.|$|E
5|$|Despite the state's general Republican and {{conservative}} leanings, Democrats have found success in various statewide elections, {{most notably in}} those involving South Dakota's congressional representatives in Washington. American <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> been becoming more active in state and county electoral politics. In the 2002 election, American Indian voting carried Tim Johnson as the Democratic candidate {{by a margin of}} 532 votes. Until his electoral defeat in 2004, Senator Tom Daschle was the Senate minority leader (and briefly its majority leader during Democratic control of the Senate in 2001–02).|$|E

They also forbid trafficking of human beings and forced labour (a crime). They also protect cultural and educational rights of ethnic and religious minorities by allowing them to preserve their languages and also establish and administer their own education institutions. They are covered in Part III (Articles 12 to 35) of Indian constitution.|$|E
5|$|John Adams (born October 9, 1951) is a {{dedicated}} {{fan of the}} Cleveland Indians, a Major League Baseball team based in Cleveland, Ohio. Adams has played his bass drum in the bleacher seats during nearly every Indians home game since 1973, which has brought him notoriety and recognition from the Indians and other organizations. The Indians pay for two season tickets for Adams and his drum, he {{has been involved in}} two ceremonial first pitches, and he is the only fan for whom the <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> dedicated a bobblehead day.|$|E
5|$|None of the Indians' first-round picks {{have won}} a World Series {{championship}} with the team, and no pick has been elected to the Hall of Fame. None of these picks have won the MLB Rookie of the Year award, although Manny Ramirez (1991) placed second in the voting in 1994. CC Sabathia (1998) is the only first-round pick of the Indians to earn a Cy Young Award with the team, winning in 2007.

The <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> also drafted two players from their home state of Ohio.|$|E
5|$|Though {{there was}} never a {{permanent}} Alaska Native settlement at the site of Fairbanks, Athabascan <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> used the area for thousands of years. An archaeological site excavated {{on the grounds of the}} University of Alaska Fairbanks uncovered a Native camp about 3,500 years old. From evidence gathered at the site, archaeologists surmise that Native activities in the area were limited to seasonal hunting and fishing. In addition, archeological sites on the grounds of nearby Fort Wainwright date back 10,000 years. Arrowheads excavated from the University of Alaska Fairbanks site matched similar items found in Asia, providing some of the first evidence that humans arrived in North America via the land bridge.|$|E
5|$|Adams still {{uses the}} same 26-inch-wide bass drum he began with in 1973. He has stated that he bought {{it as part of}} a set for $25 at a garage sale. It has the same head {{on the side of the}} drum that Adams does not beat, but Adams has stated that he replaces the other side about twice a year and also goes through about three sets of mallets each year. During games, Adams tends to drum at {{particular}} moments: when the Indians take the field at the beginning of the game, if the <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> runners in scoring position, if the Indians are tied or trailing near the end of the game, or if they are winning at the top of the ninth inning. Because of his drumming, Adams became a celebrity and his drum was soon nicknamed Big Chief Boom-Boom, by Indians radio announcer Herb Score. It has also helped him meet politicians, including U.S. senators and a Pakistani government official.|$|E

Both the Yankees and the Red Sox {{were involved in a}} tight pennant race with the Cleveland Indians until the final weekend. The Red Sox eliminated the Yankees in the final series at Fenway Park, overcoming four DiMaggio hits in the final game to tie Cleveland for the pennant. The situation forced the first-ever one-game playoff in AL history, which the Indians won 8–3 at Fenway Park. The city of Boston missed out on a chance for its first all-Boston World Series, as the Indians went on to defeat the Boston Braves in the Series, the last one the <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> won to date.|$|E
5|$|The Cleveland Indians are a Major League Baseball (MLB) {{franchise}} {{based in}} Cleveland, Ohio. They {{play in the}} American League Central division. The {{first game of the}} new baseball season is played on Opening Day, and being named the starter that day is an honor, which is often given to the player who is expected to lead the pitching staff that season, though there are various strategic reasons why a team's best pitcher might not start on Opening Day. Since joining the league in 1901, the <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> used 58 different Opening Day starting pitchers which includes the Opening Day starting pitchers from the Bluebirds and the Naps. They have a record of 58 wins and 54 losses in their Opening Day games.|$|E
5|$|The longest {{interval}} between Yankees no-hitters {{was between the}} game pitched by Larsen on October 8, 1956 and Dave Righetti's no hitter on July 4, 1983, encompassing 26 years, 8 months, and 26 days. The shortest gap between such games fell between Allie Reynolds' two no-hitters in 1951, a gap of just 2 months and 16 days from July 12 till September 28. Reynolds is the only Yankees pitcher to throw multiple no-hitters in his career, and one of only six pitchers in Major League history to throw multiple no-hitters in a season along with Max Scherzer in 2015, Roy Halladay in 2010, Nolan Ryan in 1973, Virgil Trucks in 1952, and Johnny Vander Meer in 1938. The Red Sox and the Cleveland <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> been no-hit by the Yankees {{more than any other}} franchise, each doing so three times. Notably, Reynolds' two no-hit victims in 1951 were the Red Sox and the Indians.|$|E

5|$|The {{report was}} the result of many {{cooperating}} agencies that often had conflicting goals. An initial draft was submitted to Everglades National Park management who asserted not enough water would be released to the park quickly enough—that the priority went to delivering water to urban areas. When they threatened to refuse to support it, the plan was rewritten to provide more water to the park. However, the Miccosukee <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> a reservation in between the park and water control devices, and they threatened to sue to ensure their tribal lands and a $50million casino would not be flooded. Other special interests were also concerned that businesses and residents would take second priority after nature. The Everglades, however, proved to be a bipartisan cause. The Comprehensive Everglades Restoration Plan (CERP) was authorized by the Water Resources Development Act of 2000 and signed into law by President Bill Clinton on December 11, 2000. It approved the immediate use of $1.3billion for implementation to be split by the federal government and other sources.|$|E
5|$|Until the <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> {{sold their}} lands, and removed {{from them in}} pursuance of the treaty stipulations, {{they are to be}} {{regarded}} as still in their ancient possession, and are in under their original rights, and entitled to the undisturbed enjoyment of them. This was the effect of the decision in the case of Fellows v. Blacksmith. The time for the surrender of the possession, according to their consent given in the treaty, had not expired when these taxes were levied. The period within which the removal was to take place, under the treaty of 1838, was five years from the time it went into effect. It was not proclaimed till 1840, and under that of 1842 the time did not expire till 1846. The taxation of the lands was premature and illegal.|$|E
5|$|Book Seven, The Age of Great Progress, is set {{during the}} 19th century and begins during {{a war between}} the Ottoman Empire and the Indian state of Travancore. The <b>Indians</b> <b>have</b> {{previously}} defeated the Mughals and the Safavids and have developed more modern forms of warfare, emphasising surprise and mobility, they have also invented Steam engines and Ironclad warships which they sail straight {{to the city of}} Konstantiniyye and capture it with the aid of military balloons. The Ottomans are defeated easily. A Muslim Armenian doctor named Ismail ibn Mani al-Dir, who had served the Ottoman Sultan, is captured and sent to Travancore where he learns of the amazing advancements that have been made on the sub-continent such as railways and factories. He happily joins the hospital of Travancore and begins work in anatomy and physiology. Ismail eventually meets their ruler, the Kerala of Travancore, who pursues scientific and philosophical advancement (a kind of Enlightened Despot). The Kerala's aim is to drive the Muslim invaders away and peacefully unify India into a kind of democratic confederation. Later, during the Xianfeng Emperor's reign, in the Chinese colony known as Gold Mountain, major flooding in the Central Valley of California forces the evacuation of Chinese colonial towns and Japanese settlers alike. The Japanese had originally fled to the new world to escape Chinese oppression in their homeland, but find themselves once again under the Chinese yoke. A displaced Japanese slave, Kiyoaki, and a pregnant Chinese refugee, Peng-ti, manage to flee to the great coastal city of Fangzhang. There Kiyoaki joins a secret Japanese freedom movement which is being aided by Travancore, with Ismail acting as a go-between agent.|$|E
