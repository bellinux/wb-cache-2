60|$|First {{let me say}} a word to the {{authority}}. This {{debt was}} contracted, not by the authority of the Company, not by its representatives, (as the right honorable gentleman has the unparalleled confidence to assert,) but in the ever-memorable period of 1777, by the usurped power of those who rebelliously, in conjunction with the Nabob of Arcot, had overturned the lawful government of Madras. For that rebellion this House unanimously directed a public prosecution. The delinquents, after they had subverted government, in order to make to themselves a party to support them in their power, are universally known to have dealt jobs about to the right and to the left, and to any who were willing to receive them. This usurpation, which the right honorable gentleman well knows was brought about by and for the great mass of these pretended debts, is the authority which is set up by him to represent the Company,--to represent that Company which, from the first moment of their hearing of this corrupt and <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transaction</b> to this hour, have uniformly disowned and disavowed it.|$|E

"The defence {{set up by}} Gunga Govind Sing {{does not}} go to disavow the transaction; for, if it did, the deed of sale, &c., {{produced}} by himself, and the petition to the board for its confirmation, would detect him: on the contrary, he openly admits its existence, and only strives {{to show that it}} was a voluntary one {{on the part of the}} Ranny and the servants of the Rajah. Whether voluntary or not, it was equally criminal in Gunga Govind Sing, as the public officer of government: because diametrically opposite to the positive and repeated standing orders of that government for the rule of his conduct, as dewan, and native guardian of the public rights intrusted especially to his care; because it was his duty, not only not to be guilty of a breach of those rules himself, but, as dewan, and exercising the efficient office of kanungo, to prevent, detect, expose, and apprise his employers of every instance attempted to the contrary; because it was his duty to prevent the government being defrauded, and the Rajah, a child of nine years old, robbed of his hereditary possessions, as he would have been, if this transaction had not been detected: whereas, on the contrary, the dewan is himself the principal mover and sole instrument in that fraud and robbery, if I am rightly informed, to the amount of 42,474 rupees[1] in perpetuity, by which he alone was to benefit; and because he has even dared to stand forward in an attempt to obtain our sanction, and thereby make us parties to (in my opinion) a false deed and <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transaction,</b> as his own defence now shows the bill of sale and all its collateral papers to be.|$|E

This policy's section 6 provides certain protections to any farmer whose land has been fraudulently transacted.

5000|$|According to French law, {{banks are}} liable for any {{transaction}} {{made with a}} copy of the original card and for any transaction made without a card (on the phone or on the Internet), so banks have to pay back any <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transaction</b> to the card holder if the previous criteria are met. Fighting card fraud is therefore more interesting for banks. As a consequence, French banks websites usually propose an [...] "e-card" [...] service ("electronic (bank) card"), where a new virtual card is created and linked to a physical card. Such virtual card can be used only once and for the maximum amount given by the card holder. If the virtual card number is intercepted or used {{to try to get a}} higher amount than expected, the transaction is blocked.|$|E

50|$|One of {{the most}} common reasons for a {{chargeback}} is a <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transaction.</b> In this case, a credit card is used without the consent or proper authorization of the card holder. In some cases, a merchant is responsible for charges fraudulently imposed on a customer. Fraudulent card transactions often originate with criminals who gain access to secure payment card data and set up schemes to exploit the data. In cases of card not present transactions the merchant is usually responsible for the chargeback and associated fees. After the adoption of EMV (cards with a chip in them), merchants who have not upgraded to EMV technology usually become liable for chargebacks received (unless others in the payment chain have also not upgraded) even in cases where prior to EMV adoption the merchant would not have been liable.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — The credit/debit card issuing {{banks are}} facing a {{critical}} problem of <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transactions.</b> Online purchases may be fraudulent if the credit card number, expiry date and CID number are copied from the card. Identifying <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transactions</b> typically takes hours or days, and many such transactions may slip through before a hold can {{be put on the}} card. This paper tries to summarize various categories of frauds as well as fraudsters. It also tries to explain various categories of data breach carried out by fraudsters for financial transactions. A survey of various techniques is done to explore the possibility of proposing a new technique for developing a real-time fraud detection system...|$|R
40|$|Abstract:- Soft-products are {{intangible}} {{products that}} can be consumed without shipment, such as software, music and calling cards (calling time). The demand for soft-products on the Internet has been increasing {{for the past few}} years. At the same time, <b>fraudulent</b> credit card <b>transactions</b> have also increased. Compared to tangible products, <b>fraudulent</b> credit card <b>transactions</b> on soft-products are easier to conduct whilst difficult to recover. <b>Fraudulent</b> <b>transactions</b> are a major problem for e-commerce merchants, customers, and credit card issuers. The Trusted Email mechanism is new way to prevent <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transactions</b> on soft-products. Trusted Email is a custom email solution that can uniquely identify and authenticate the online customer, prevent unauthorized credit card transactions, and effectively resolve e-commerce disputes. In this paper we will study where the Trusted Email server should reside, who should handle it and why. In accordance with the best location of the Trusted Email server, Anonymous credit card transactions will be also studied in this paper and the new term “Selective Anonymity ” will be introduced...|$|R

50|$|Chadwick LJ {{held that}} there was not enough to {{constitute}} fraud in this case on this single instance. Not every <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transaction</b> makes the business a business carried on with intent to defraud. Moreover, there must be a causal connection between the fraud and the loss, or ‘some nexus between (i) the loss which has been caused to the company’s creditors generally by the carrying on of the business in the manner which gives rise to the exercise of the power and (ii) the contribution which those knowingly party to the carrying on of the business in that manner should be ordered to make to the assets in which the company’s creditors will share in the liquidation.’ Then, obiter he said it could not have been the intention of Parliament to allow more than compensatory claims under section 213. Disapproving the order of the judge below, he said that the provision for criminal charges in Companies Act 1985, section 458 (now Companies Act 2006, s 993) precluded any necessity for a punitive element.|$|E
50|$|In April 1990, {{together}} with Oldřich Lichtenberg and Miloslav Zapletal, Kocáb founded {{a company called}} Art Production K, where he {{served as chairman of}} the board. In May 1991 he became board member of newly privatized building company Montované stavby Praha (MSP). In January 1992 MSP founded Investment privatization fund TREND (IPF TREND) and Kocáb became chairman of its board. Another board Member was his brother-in-law Martin Kratochvíl. In January 1993 the companies Art Production K (27.5%), Bonton (27.5%), MSP (10%) and Bankovní dům SKALA (35%) founded a limited liability investment company IC TREND to manage the IPF TRENT portfolio for a fee. In February 1995 the managers of IPF TREND founded a closely owned corporation IC TREND for the same purpose. In August 1995 Kocáb, Kratochvíl and other owners of IC TREND sold the company to broker Královéhradecká brokerská společnost (KBS) for a substantial amount of money. The new owners of IC TREND used the acquired company as a vehicle to strip dispersed shareholders of IPF TREND from its assets. After a first <b>fraudulent</b> <b>transaction</b> by KBS managers, used to cover the costs associated with purchase of IC TREND, Kocáb and Kratochvíl resigned from the board of IPF TREND.|$|E
5000|$|The palace {{was built}} in Tudor style {{architecture}} with fortified towers, battlements and turrets.

The furniture, which was neo-classical, Victorian and Edwardian in style, was bought from John Roberts and Lazarus. The upkeep of the gardens was {{the responsibility of the}} horticulturist Gustav Hermann Krumbiegel. A total of 35 rooms were built in the palace with most of them being bedrooms and a swimming pool. The renovation included addition of stained glass and mirrors, specially imported from England, besides a manual lift and wooden fans from General Electric. In 1970, HH Jayachamarajendra Wodeyar is said to have transferred the possession of the property to two companies promoted by a civil contractor by name Chamaraju, close to the corridors of power. These companies were known as Chamundi Hotels (P) Ltd (110 acre) and Sree Venkateswara Real Estate Enterprises (p) Ltd (344 acre).
