40|$|Studying {{species at}} the {{molecular}} level can provide insights into how ecological and biological processes interrelate resulting in the diversity we see today. This information can be applied to conserve species at risk of extinction, or to better manage genetic diversity in species of economic importance. Species that inhabit freshwater riverine systems commonly exhibit population structures that are related to their relative dispersal capability, contemporary stream structure and/or historical stream structure. This thesis examined the populations genetic structure of wild and cultured stocks of the commercially farmed freshwater crayfish, C. quadricarinatus (von Martens), using genetic markers characterized by different modes of inheritance. C. quadricarinatus is distributed naturally in riverine systems in northern Australia, and southern Paupa New Guinea (PNG) and inhabits a variety of freshwater ecosystems ranging from ephemeral to permanent. Life history characteristics of C. quadricarinatus suggest a high level of genetic structuring among wild stocks might exist. However, seasonal flooding coupled with low topography across its distribution in northern Australia may promote sufficient gene flow among rivers to produce genetic homogeneity. Historical gene flow may also influence modern genetic structure as many distinct riverine catchments that C. quadricarinatus inhabits, were once connected at times of lower sea level. Insight into genetic relationships among C. quadricarinatus populations will allow for better management practices of wild populations in the future. The study investigated phylogenetic relationships among C. quadricarinatus representing 17 discrete natural drainages across the natural range in Australia and PNG, using 16 s and COI gene sequences. Sequence analysis of both genes resolved two distinct genealogical lineages in Australia and three in PNG. The two divergent Australian lineages concur with original taxonomic descriptions of Reik (1969) based on external morphological differences. The three C. quadricarinatus populations sampled in PNG were all genetically distinct from each other, with one exhibiting a close association with an Australia lineage. The immense physical barriers (rugged mountain ranges) to gene flow in PNG will almost certainly have reduced dispersal capabilities for C. quadricarinatus. During times of lowered sea levels in the past, Australia and southern PNG were a single landmass with terrestrial and freshwater organisms theoretically able to disperse over associated land and via freshwater connections. The close genetic relationship between PNG and Australian C. quadricarinatus support a recent freshwater connection and hence gene flow between northern Australia and PNG C. quadricarinatus populations. Genetic differentiation among some C. quadricarinatus lineages exhibit as much genetic divergence at 16 s RNA sequences as taxonomically recognised sub-species in the Cherax genus. Since C. quadricarinatus was originally described as different species based on external morphological differences (Reik, 1969), it is recommended that the taxonomy of C. quadricarinatus in Australia and PNG be re-evaluated. C. quadricarinatus specific microsatellite markers were developed for this study. Five variable loci were employed to investigate the extent of contemporary gene flow among fourteen C. quadricarinatus wild river populations in northern Australia. High FST and genetic distance estimates observed among pair wise comparisons of C. quadricarinatus populations are consistent with limited or no gene flow occurring among drainages. Speculation that C. quadricarinatus may disperse between adjacent or nearby drainages at times of flood, either across floodplains, or via flood plumes therefore seems highly unlikely among the populations examined in the current study. No significant correlation was observed between geographic distance and genetic distance among C. quadricarinatus populations here. C. quadricarinatus populations most closely resemble an island-like model, where gene flow is independent of geographic distance among populations and where genetic divergence occurs {{to a greater or lesser}} extent as a result of genetic drift within otherwise isolated populations. A significant number of C. quadricarinatus populations showed deviations from expected Hardy-Weinberg equilibrium (HWE). Samples sizes may not have been sufficiently large to reflect a true representation of genotypic proportions present in the sampled populations due to the highly variable nature of microsatellite loci. Deviations from HWE equilibrium, however, can also result from null alleles. Null allele estimates suggested a large proportion of null alleles were present in the C. quadricarinatus populations analysed. This may be a result of C. quadricarinatus populations confined to discrete drainages experiencing independent evolution, resulting in mutations in primer binding sites. The growing economic potential of C. quadricarinatus culture, both domestically and internationally, prompted expanding the current study to examine genetic diversity levels in commercial C. quadricarinatus stocks. The study employed five microsatellite markers to quantify genetic diversity in four Australian and three C. quadricarinatus culture stocks from overseas. Many C. quadricarinatus culture stocks also showed deviations from HWE expectations. This was not a surprising result given that the wild populations also deviated and domestication can also influence HWE. Relatively high levels of genetic diversity were observed. This probably results from intentional mixing of discrete river strains for production of the first commercial stock. Genetic differentiation estimates among culture stocks and assignment tests indicated that overseas culture stocks are most likely derived from the first commercial culture stock developed in Australia and then disseminated widely (the Hutchings stock). Robin Hutchings was a <b>known</b> <b>supplier</b> of live C. quadricarinatus to many international culture initiatives. Assignment of culture stocks back to their wild origins indicated that all C. quadricarinatus culture stocks sampled possess alleles that originate from the Flinders River (proportions ranged from 33 - 94 %). Domestication of C. quadricarinatus to date has not resulted in significant reductions in levels of genetic diversity (heterozygosity or alleles richness) when compared to wild populations sampled in this study. Comparing culture stocks to wild populations to gauge their 'genetic health' may not be a suitable scale for evaluating genetic diversity in culture stocks. Wild populations are essentially evolving independently, are subjected to harsh seasonal environmental fluctuations resulting in periodic population crashes (genetic bottlenecks), with little or no recruitment from neighbouring drainages (gene flow). This study does however indicate that there is a large amount of genetic diversity distributed among wild populations that has yet to be exploited in culture. Genetic diversity in wild populations provides a resource for future stock improvement programs for C. quadricarinatus culture and thus requires careful conservation and appropriate management...|$|E

40|$|This {{report is}} {{concerned}} with {{an investigation of the}} major markets for processed tropical or exotic fruit. The markets studied are France, the Federal Republic of Germany, the Netherlands, the United Kingdom, Switzerland, the United States and Japan. Tropical fruit and their products are many and diverse; the study is concentrated on the more dynamic sectors of the market: that is, pulps, juices and canned fruits. The processed fruit for which there is significant demand are passion fruit, guava, mango and papaya, although other processed tropical fruit are also traded and are discussed in the text: these include soursop, cherimoya, lychee, longan and rambutan as well as canned tropical fruit salad. The statistical base for research on markets for processed tropical fruit is limited. Generally, data are not available for individual fruit: so for most of the countries mentioned, estimations of market size had to be made from a study of the residual 'other fruit' category in import statistics, linked where possible to <b>known</b> <b>suppliers</b> of processed tropical fruit.

40|$|This is {{the third}} edition of the Australian Fashion Report. It is being {{launched}} {{on the eve of}} the third anniversary of the Rana Plaza factory collapse in Bangladesh, a tragedy which cut short the lives of 1, 136 garment workers. When the factory came down, it simultaneously catapulted the poor and unsafe working conditions of the apparel industry to front page news and to the front of our minds. The Rana Plaza shocked the collective conscience of consumers and decision makers across the world, helping to accelerate efforts to uphold the rights of workers throughout the entire apparel industry supply chain. Three years on however, the need remains pressing. There are presently 14. 2 million people in forced labour exploitation and 168 million child labourers scattered across the global economy. Many of this number are forced to work in the farms and factories that feed the apparel industry. For millions of others working in the industry, wages remain so low that they are unable to lift themselves and their families out of poverty. The Australian Fashion Report sheds light on what the industry and individual companies are doing to address forced labour, child labour and exploitation. Each report - since the launch of the first in 2013 - has tracked the progress within the industry. The change since 2013 has been significant. In this edition we have assessed 87 companies, awarding each a grade from A to F based on the strength of their labour rights management systems to mitigate the risk of exploitation in their supply chain. This report marks a significant expansion of the work of previous reports adding 50 % more companies, updating the research and adopting a new and enhanced rating tool. 78 % of the companies assessed directly engaged in the research process - up from 54 % in the first report. Fairtrade companies, though still relatively niche, remain the standout when it comes to strong labour rights management. Etiko and Audrey Blue (inc. Mighty Good Undies) both received A+ grades. The next best performer was one of the world’s biggest fashion retailers, Inditex (Zara), which received an A grade. Australian brands Cotton On Group, APG & Co (Saba, Sportscraft, Willow, JAG), Country Road Group and Pacific Brands all received a commendable B+. The past 12 months have seen some substantial improvements in reported company performance, with APG & Co, Industrie and David Jones being the most significant. APG & Co demonstrated that it had substantially traced back to the inputs stage of its supply chain (it knew who its fabric suppliers were), and that it sourced from predominantly unionised factories for its final stage of manufacturing. Industrie demonstrated that it had significant traceability back to its input suppliers, and that it had begun work to understand what percentage of its factories were currently paying a living wage. David Jones results reflect a strong uptick in investments to improve labour rights, significantly improving traceability and the quality of its auditing and supplier relationships. These three companies are reflective of one of the most welcome trends in the industry - the improved company knowledge of <b>suppliers.</b> <b>Knowing</b> <b>suppliers</b> is critical to a strong labour rights management system. If companies don’t know or don’t care who their suppliers are, then they cannot ensure that workers are not being exploited. In 2013, we found that only half of companies had complete knowledge of who their suppliers were at the final stage of production (the manufacturing or ‘cut, make and trim’ suppliers). This has since increased to 70 %. When we focus in on those companies that have been assessed across all three reports, the proportion rises to an impressive 94 %. It is clear that the industry is also increasing its efforts to <b>know</b> <b>suppliers</b> deeper into the supply chain. In 2013, 41 % of companies had engaged in some effort to <b>know</b> their input <b>suppliers</b> (e. g. where their fabric is produced), this has now increased to 79 %. However, there is still much to be done. Only 31 % of companies knew more than 75 % of their input suppliers, and at the next tier down - at the raw materials level - only 5 % of companies knew who all of their suppliers were. Continuing to improve traceability will remain one of the most important challenges for the industry. While inputs and raw materials sit outside the purview of companies, the worst forms of worker rights abuse (including forced and child labour) will continue to remain prevalent in these parts of the supply chain...|$|R

40|$|Heightened ethical {{concerns}} involving upstream suppliers (e. g., Peanut Corporation of America, dairy {{suppliers to}} Chinese infant formula manufacturers) have sparked interest in how managers' knowledge of suppliers' behavior influences decision making. This article explores {{the role of}} managers' ethical beliefs in these often information asymmetric decisions. Using economic experiments, the authors asked managers to make strategic marketing decisions given upstream supplier ethical information. The results show how information asymmetries can interact with managers' ethical beliefs to produce inconsistent behaviors related to (1) upstream investment in ethical product attributes and (2) willingness to leverage ethical product attributes in downstream markets. Specifically, low-ethical-beliefs managers seemed to rationalize leveraging ethics downstream even when upstream supplier past behavior was negative. High-ethical-beliefs managers invested positively in ethical product attributes with a <b>known</b> ethical <b>supplier</b> but were less willing to leverage that behavior downstream. The findings provide insight into how managers' individual ethical beliefs, given upstream supplier information asymmetries, can affect stakeholders, including consumers, investors, and society at large...|$|R
