2500|$|While glass <b>fuses</b> <b>have</b> the {{advantage}} of a fuse element visible for inspection purposes, they have a low breaking capacity (interrupting rating), which generally restricts them to applications of 15 A or less at 250 VAC.

Filling a fuse body with sand provides additional cooling of the arc and increases the breaking capacity of the fuse.

5000|$|Lucas type fuses {{are used}} in old British-made or {{assembled}} automobiles. The physical length of this ceramic type of fuse is either 1 inch or 1.25 inch, with conical ends. Glass tube <b>fuses</b> <b>have</b> straight ends. Lucas type fuses usually use the same color-coding for the rated current. Lucas <b>fuses</b> <b>have</b> three ratings; the continuous current {{they are designed to}} carry, the instantaneous current at which they will fuse, and the continuous current at which they will also fuse. The figure found on Lucas fuses is the continuous fusing current which is twice the continuous ampere rating that the system should be using; this can be a source of confusion when replacing Lucas fuses with non Lucas fuses. The Lucas 1/4" [...] diameter glass tube <b>fuse</b> <b>have</b> a different length as compared to the standard US item. The Lucas 1/4" [...] diameter glass tube fuse is 1 and 5/32" [...] mm long, while the US standard 1/4" [...] glass tube fuse is 1 and 1/4" [...] mm long.|$|R

40|$|To develop {{high voltage}} etching fuse for {{protecting}} semiconductors, two {{tests were conducted}} in this research. One is the test of various types of 600 V rating fuse. The test {{results showed that the}} <b>fuse</b> <b>having</b> 6 series breaking points exhibited better current breaking characteristics than those having other breaking points. The otper is the test of 6 kV rating etching fuse by connecting 8 pieces of 600 V fuse element in series. Good breaking performance and small I 2 t value were obtained. Therefore {{it will be possible to}} produce a high voltage rating <b>fuse</b> <b>having</b> lower I 2 t value than those ofcurrent products...|$|R
