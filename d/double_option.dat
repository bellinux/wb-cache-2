40|$|International audienceDouble barrier options {{have been}} traded {{for a long}} time in the markets and they are {{embedded}} in a variety of popular structured products. However, in their standard form, they lack flexibility inasmuch as they feature a constant barrier level during the entire <b>option</b> life. Step <b>double</b> barrier <b>options</b> overcome this limitation by allowing investors to set the knock-out or knock-in levels they want at the time of their choosing rather than by imposing an arbitrary mathematical form upon the time-varying double barrier. Although step <b>double</b> barrier <b>options</b> are actively traded, no analytical formula is known for their valuation and hedging. In this paper, not only regular step <b>double</b> barrier <b>options</b> are analytically valued, but also more exotic contracts combining periods with and without active barriers as well as step <b>double</b> barrier <b>options</b> written on several assets.

50|$|Option running plays are as {{numerous}} as the schemes that employ them. However, nearly all option running plays {{can be characterized}} as either a <b>double</b> <b>option</b> or triple option. This is determined by the number of choices available during the play.|$|E
50|$|A {{very popular}} type of <b>double</b> <b>option</b> is the Read Option. It is {{typically}} {{run out of}} the shotgun formation. The quarterback reads the defensive end on the side in which the play is designed to take the running back. If the defensive end is playing outside the tackle after the snap of the ball, the quarterback hands the ball off to the running back. If the defensive end is playing inside of the tackle after the snap, the quarterback keeps the ball and runs counter to the blocking scheme.|$|E
50|$|The {{most popular}} running play {{employed}} in the spread is the read option. This play {{is also known as}} the zone read, QB choice, or QB wrap. A type of <b>double</b> <b>option,</b> the read option is a relatively simple play during which the offensive line zone blocks in one direction, ignoring defensive personnel, while the quarterback makes a single read (usually of the backside defensive end or linebacker) and decides whether to keep the ball (if the backside defender crashes down) or to hand off to the back (if the defender indicates that he will cover the quarterback).|$|E

5000|$|The {{wishbone}} {{was designed}} to run a triple-option with a lead blocker. The purpose of an option is to eliminate one defender without blocking him. Ideally, the defender must make a choice to eliminate one of two offensive players. This is a <b>double</b> <b>option.</b> This option offensive scheme forces a defender to choose one of two offensive players who can advance the ball and then allows the other offensive player to carry the ball, making whatever choice the defender made the [...] "wrong" [...] choice. Because of {{this aspect of the}} defensive player taking himself out of the play by his choice, the offensive player that would otherwise block that defensive player can now block a different defender, placing severe pressure on the defense to cover the dive, the quarterback run, the pitch or the pass to a receiver.|$|E
5000|$|Several rule changes {{went into}} effect in April 1984. The couple in control was {{required}} to hit their plunger to determine the question value displayed on a [...] "money machine", a random light which stopped at $50, $100, or $150. The amount could also be accompanied with [...] "Prize," [...] which awarded a bonus prize to the team that answered correctly, or [...] "Turnover," [...] which gave control of the question to the opposing team. In the second round, a [...] "Number Off" [...] space was added to the machine, which allowed the team who answered correctly to remove one extra number from the combination lock if they reached the bonus round. Also, if the winning team led by $500-$950 after two rounds, they originally received a prize, but this was later changed to a $500 bonus. Winning by $1,000 or more was worth a new car.

40|$|We {{analyze the}} {{performance}} of robust hedging strategies of digital <b>double</b> barrier <b>options</b> of Cox and Obłój (2011) against that of traditional hedging methods such as delta and delta/vega hedging. Digital <b>double</b> barrier <b>options</b> are financial derivative contracts which pay out a fixed amount {{on the condition that}} the underlying asset remains within or breaks into a range defined by two distinct barrier levels. We perform the analysis in hypothetical forward markets driven by models with stochastic volatility and jumps, calibrated to the AUD/USD foreign exchange rate market. Our findings are strikingly unanimous and suggest that, in the presence of model uncertainty and/or transaction costs, robust hedging strategies typically outperform in a substantial way model-specific hedging methods.

40|$|<b>Double</b> barrier <b>options</b> {{have become}} popular {{instruments}} in derivative markets. Several papers have already analysed double knock-out call and put options using different methods. In a recent paper, Geman and Yor (1996) derive expressions for the Laplace transform of the <b>double</b> barrrier <b>option</b> price. However, {{they have to}} resort to numerical inversion of the Laplace transform to obtain option prices. In this paper, we are able to solve, using contour integration, the inverse of the Laplace transforms analytically thereby eliminating the need for numerical inversion routines. To our knowledge, {{this is one of the}} first applications of contour integration to option pricing problems. To illustrate the power of this method, we derive analytical valuation formulas for a much wider variety of <b>double</b> barrier <b>options</b> than has been treated in the literature so far. Many of these variants are nowadays being traded in the markets.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. In this thesis the author describes the design and operation of a learning environment aimed at imparting technical, technological and managerial knowledge, developing understanding of the underlying issues and enhancing team work skills for an advanced technology future. He offers an analysis of learning, education and training and compares group work with individual tasks, presents a major case study and illustrates the features which distinguish the approach from role play, simulation and experiential learning. When staff at Brunel University were faced {{with the problem of}} teaching Computer Integrated Manufacturing (CIM) to engineering students on thin sandwich type undergraduate degree programmes the writer suggested the use of an approach he would later describe as 'practice based learning' or 'real life simulation'. The fourth year course in CIM is designed as a <b>double</b> <b>option</b> for the complementary undergraduate courses, Brunel Manufacturing Engineering (BME) and Special Engineering Programmes (SEP). It is an extension of the Manufacturing Design and Practice course in years one to three of the BME course and of the Design strand on SEP, both of which restrict students' work to the use of individual machine tools and stand alone computing facilities. A wide range of teaching methods is used on the CIM course, including lectures by course staff, presentations by experts and, as the major element, a large group project involving all the students on the course, organised in a management matrix, coordinated by the students and supported by the staff acting as experts. The students also undertake assignment work alongside the technical tasks, to focus their thinking and to improve written communication skills. While the course described cannot replace more than a small proportion of the more conventional lecture, laboratory and tutorial teaching on an engineering programme, it provides a setting where students can experiment and learn about their own strengths and weaknesses in a realistic situation and in the context of teamwork. It also offers a space where they can make quite serious mistakes without direct consequences to their careers. The experience of seven years leads the author to believe that advanced manufacturing technologies and the associated management techniques should be taught in a project based environment with clear and real targets and realistic constraints, offering students challenges to which they can only rise through close and creative team work. The management of task execution must be left largely in the students' own hands. A high level of "consultant" type support is essential though, allied to an assessment scheme which promises and ensures fair treatment of the individual. The different parts of the thesis will be relevant to readers depending on their interest and background. Chapter 1 sets the scene and outlines the approach taken. Following this broad outline of the scope of the dissertation the author places Computer Integrated Manufacturing in a wider context in chapter 2, by providing an introduction to the underlying issues of computer integration and human factors. He puts forward a case for new approaches to the education and training of engineers and managers who will be working in Computer Integrated Manufacturing and Advanced Manufacturing Environments in general. Chapter 3 is devoted to the management of projects while chapter 4 is used to question the role of the engineer. Chapters 5 and 6 provide an introduction to theories of knowledge, teaching, learning and motivation. Chapters 7 and 8 are devoted to particular aspects of engineering education, while chapter 9 reviews the approach used at Brunel University. The topical issues of competence and its relevance to engineering education is discussed in chapter 10, leading into chapters 11 and 12 which deal with aspects of the CIM course. Chapters 13 and 14 are devoted to case-studies and particular tools. The key question of assessment of a practice oriented and team based course is addressed in chapter 15, followed by an evaluation of the CIM process and its application to engineering education of a full time nature which is included in chapters 17 and 18.

40|$|A <b>double</b> barrier <b>option</b> has two barriers, {{one above}} {{and the other}} below the current stock price. It is {{considered}} as a path dependent option since the payoff to the holder depends on the breaching behaviors of the stock price process {{with respect to the}} two barriers. The <b>double</b> barrier <b>option</b> contract specifies three different payoffs, which are dependent on whether the up-barrier or down-barrier is hit, or no breaching of either barrier throughout the whole life of the option. A barrier is said to be of knock-out type if the resulting payoff upon hitting by the stock price is a rebate payment (the rebate amount may depend on the time of hitting), and knock-in type if the holder receives a new option upon hitting. The barrier feature may be applied over the whole life or a partial life of the option.
