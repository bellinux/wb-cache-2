40|$|CDMA (Code Division Multiple Access) {{is known}} to {{decrease}} <b>inter-service</b> <b>interference</b> in Satellite Communication Systems. Its performance is increased by chip quasi-synchronous operation which virtually eliminates the self-noise; however, the theory shows that the time error on the synchronization {{has to be kept}} at less than one tenth of a chip which, for 1 Mchip/sec. spreading rate, corresponds to 10 (exp - 7) sec. This, on the return-link, may only be achieved by means of a closed loop control system which, for mobile communication systems, has to be capable of autonomous operation. Until now some results have been reported on the feasibility of chip quasi-synchronous operation for mobile communication systems only including satellites on GEO (Geostationary Earth Orbit). In what follows, the basic principles are exposed, and results are presented showing how low chip synchronism error may be achieved by means of an autonomous control loop operating through satellites on any Earth orbit...|$|E
