500|$|The {{logistics}} of any coring project are complex because the locations are usually difficult to reach, {{and may be}} at high altitude. [...] The largest projects require years of planning and years to execute, and are usually run as international consortiums. [...] The EastGRIP project, for example, which as of 2017 is drilling in eastern Greenland, {{is run by the}} Centre for Ice and Climate, in Denmark, and includes representatives from 12 countries on its steering committee. [...] Over the course of a drilling season, scores of people work at the camp, and logistics support includes airlift capabilities provided by the US Air National Guard, using Hercules transport planes owned by the National Science Foundation.

500|$|A log is kept with {{information}} about the core, including its length and the depth it was retrieved from, and the core may be marked to show its orientation. [...] It is usually cut into shorter sections, the standard length in the US being one metre. [...] The cores are then stored on site, usually in a space below snow level to simplify temperature maintenance, though additional refrigeration can be used. [...] If more drilling fluid must be removed, air may be blown over the cores. [...] Any samples needed for preliminary analysis are taken. [...] The core is then bagged, often in polythene, and stored for shipment. [...] Additional packing, including padding material, is added. [...] When the cores are flown from the <b>drilling</b> <b>site,</b> the aircraft's flight deck is unheated to help maintain a low temperature; when they are transported by ship they must be kept in a refrigeration unit.|$|E

Hunter was skeptical that the new site would lead to success. [...] He expected it would fail like previous ventures and that Imperial would then limit its focus to Alberta's natural gas fields.

In order to overcome the relatively short operating window of drillships during the ice-free season (100 to 110 days a year) and the water depth limitations of artificial dredged islands, Gulf Canada Resources began developing an Arctic drilling system consisting of two mobile drilling units: a Mobile Arctic Caisson (MAC) that could be submerged and filled with gravel to form an artificial drilling island in waters up to [...] in depth and a floating Conical Drilling Unit (CDU) designed for drilling in water depths between [...] while afloat. These units, each capable of completing one exploration well per year, would be supported by four Arctic Class 4 vessels: two large icebreakers providing 24-hour ice management and standby services on the <b>drilling</b> <b>site</b> and two smaller icebreaking vessels responsible for anchor handling and supply runs between the drilling rigs and coastal bases. By 1982, both drilling units and all four icebreaking vessels were under construction in Canada and Japan for BeauDril, Gulf Canada's drilling subsidiary, and the company had committed itself to a billion-dollar exploration program between 1983 and 1988.|$|E
