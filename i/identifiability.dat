25|$|Frankie Laine was {{somebody}} that everybody knew. He {{was a kind}} of a household word like Frank Sinatra or Bobby Darin or Peggy Lee or Ella Fitzgerald—Frankie Laine {{was one of the great}} popular singers and stylists of that time…And his style…he was one of those artists who had such a unique stamp—nobody sounded like he did. You could hear two notes and you knew who it was and you were right on the beam with it right away. And of course that defines a successful popular artist, at least at that time. These people were all uniquely individual and Frank was on the front rank of those people in his appeal to the public and his success and certainly in his <b>identifiability.</b> — John Williams.|$|E
2500|$|Facilitated by the Department of Trade & Industry (DTI), {{discussions were}} held between certain ISPs, the Metropolitan Police, the Home Office, {{and a body}} called the [...] "Safety Net Foundation" [...] (formed by the Dawe Charitable Trust). This {{resulted}} in the [...] "R3 Safety Net Agreement", where [...] "R3" [...] referred to the triple approach of rating, reporting, and responsibility. In September 1996, this agreement was made between the ISPA, LINX, and the Safety Net Foundation, which was subsequently renamed the Internet Watch Foundation. The agreement set requirements for associated ISPs regarding <b>identifiability</b> and traceability of Internet users; ISPs had {{to cooperate with the}} IWF to identify providers of illegal content and facilitate easier traceability.|$|E
2500|$|When {{the second}} game was {{localized}} for the American audience, there was concern about the Slimes <b>identifiability</b> with the public, and so Dragon Quest {{was added to the}} title. Watabe {{wanted to make sure that}} Rocket Slime used both screens for gameplay, unlike most other DS titles that just used it for menus, believing that the duel screens was the consoles [...] "focus". Early in the title's life, the developers had a version of it that uses the touch screen to use Rocket's Elasto Blast technique, but scrapped the idea, due to it being too hard to control. In a search for what to do with the Nintendo DS's two screens, the developers arrived at the idea of a tank battle, and a duel view allowing players to see inside and outside the tank at once. Each character name was approved during localization by Square Enix, and names involving American cultural references had to be explained in Japanese, a task that saw many jokes cut and replaced.|$|E

50|$|Practical <b>identifiability</b> {{analysis}} {{can be performed}} by exploring the fit of existing model to experimental data. Once the fitting in any measure was obtained, parameter <b>identifiability</b> {{analysis can}} be performed either locally near a given point (usually near the parameter values provided the best model fit) or globally over the extended parameter space. The common example of the practical <b>identifiability</b> analysis is profile likelihood method.|$|E

50|$|<b>Identifiability</b> {{analysis}} is group of methods {{that are based}} on mathematical statistics and can be used to estimate how well model parameters are determined by the amount and quality of experimental data. Therefore, these methods explore not only <b>identifiability</b> of a model as its theoretical property, but also the goodness of model relation to particular experimental data or more generally to the configuration of experiment in general.|$|E

50|$|Identifiability- According to Thorndike, the {{identification}} or placement {{of a situation}} is a first response of the nervous system, which can recognize it. Then connections may be made to one another or to another response, and these connections depend upon the original identification. Therefore, {{a large amount of}} learning is made up of changes in the <b>identifiability</b> of situations. Thorndike also believed that analysis might turn situations into compounds of features, such as the number of sides on a shape, to help the mind grasp and retain the situation, and increase their <b>identifiability.</b>|$|E

50|$|Each type of {{modeling}} technique has its strengths and limitations. PBPK modeling is no exception. One limitation {{is the potential}} for a large number of parameters, some of which may be correlated. This can lead to the issues of parameter <b>identifiability</b> and redundancy.|$|E
50|$|The {{identifiable}} victim {{effect has}} been contested in academia. Critics argue that, when a victim is identified, {{information such as}} age and gender of the victim are revealed and people are especially sympathetic {{in response to that}} information rather than to <b>identifiability</b> per se.|$|E
50|$|Anonymity {{also has}} {{strategic}} consequences: {{it affects the}} ability to express personal and social identities. Strategic concerns come into play when an out-group has more power than the ingroup, and where the norms of both groups {{are at odds with}} each other. In such cases, the <b>identifiability</b> of ingroup members towards the outgroup will shift the power balance between groups: <b>identifiability</b> towards a more powerful outgroup limits {{the degree to which the}} ingroup's identity can be expressed freely and without sanction on those dimensions where ingroup norms conflict with out-group standards and values, and which are punishable or otherwise sanctionable. Conversely, anonymity towards a more powerful outgroup may be a convenient instrument for the ingroup to express itself on those same dimensions.|$|E

50|$|The general <b>identifiability</b> {{condition}} for this model {{remains an open}} question. It is known however {{that in the case}} when (ε,η) are independent and jointly normal, the parameter β is identified if and only if it is impossible to find a non-singular k×k block matrix a A (where a is a k×1 vector) such that a′x* is distributed normally and independently from A′x*.|$|E
50|$|In {{many types}} of models, such as mixture models, the {{posterior}} may be multi-modal. In such a case, the usual recommendation is that one should choose the highest mode: {{this is not always}} feasible (global optimization is a difficult problem), nor in some cases even possible (such as when <b>identifiability</b> issues arise). Furthermore, the highest mode may be uncharacteristic {{of the majority of the}} posterior.|$|E
50|$|The idea of profile {{likelihood}} {{can also}} be used to compute confidence intervals that often have better small-sample properties than those based on asymptotic standard errors calculated from the full likelihood.
