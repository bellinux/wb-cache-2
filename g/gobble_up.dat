5|$|Mike and Dave witness {{one of the}} klowns using shadow puppets {{to shrink}} {{a crowd of people}} into the palm of its hand, then dump them into a sack of popcorn, {{revealed}} to be sentient creatures that eagerly <b>gobble</b> <b>up</b> the human prey. Back at the police station, Mooney is innundated with calls from townspeople reporting incidents with the klowns, but he dismisses all of them. Soon after, a klown arrives at the station and Mooney arrests it, believing it to be a teen prankster. Dave returns to the station to find two prisoners encased in cocoons, and the now escaped klown using a deceased Mooney as a ventriloquist's dummy. Dave shoots the klown several times before destroying its nose, which causes it to spin wildly and explode.|$|E
25|$|Garudas are {{the great}} golden-winged Peng birds. They {{also have the}} ability to grow large or small, and to appear and {{disappear}} at will. Their wingspan is 330 yojanas (one yojana being 8 miles long). With one flap of its wings, a Peng bird dries up the waters of the sea so that it can <b>gobble</b> <b>up</b> all the exposed dragons. With another flap of its wings, it can level the mountains by moving them into the ocean.|$|E
500|$|On 1 February 1777, Brigadier General Sir William Erskine, 1st Baronet set up {{a clever}} trap. He sent a party of foragers to Drake's Farm near Metuchen. When Scott's 5th Virginia tried to <b>gobble</b> <b>up</b> the small party, Erskine rushed his large force into action. Battalions of grenadiers, light infantry, 42nd Foot and Hessians appeared, {{supported}} by eight artillery pieces. Instead of fleeing, the Virginians launched a vicious attack which momentarily broke a grenadier battalion. Under intense cannon fire, the American attack was stopped, but the soldiers fought tenaciously until the British fell back toward Brunswick. The Americans admitted 30 to 40 casualties while claiming to have killed 36 British and wounding 100 more. The action was marred by an ugly incident when Lieutenant William Kelly and six other wounded Americans were abandoned during a tactical withdrawal. The frustrated British fell upon the seven helpless men with bayonets and musket butts and slaughtered them all. When the Americans recovered the mangled bodies they were infuriated. Brigadier General Adam Stephen exchanged a series of irate letters with Erskine, who denied all responsibility for the incident.|$|E

They pretend, also, that therefore it is that they frequent the house of the godly and the appointments of the Lord; but, when they are by themselves, as the robin, they can catch and <b>gobble</b> <b>up</b> spiders, they can change their diet, drink wickedness, and swallow down sin like water." ...|$|E
60|$|LORD SUMMERHAYS. It's {{not alone}} that. Ive not {{forgotten}} {{the brutality of}} my own boyhood. But do try to learn, glorious young beast that you are, that age is squeamish, sentimental, fastidious. If you cant understand my holier feelings, at least you know the bodily infirmities of the old. You know that I darent eat all the rich things you <b>gobble</b> <b>up</b> at every meal; that I cant bear the noise and racket and clatter that affect you no more than they affect a stone. Well, my soul is like that too. Spare it: be gentle with it [he involuntarily puts out his hands to plead: she takes them with a laugh]. If you could possibly {{think of me as}} half an angel and half an invalid, we should get on much better together.|$|E
6000|$|Hawaii is a queer place. Everything {{socially}} is what I {{may call}} topsy- turvy. Not but what things are correct. They are {{almost too much}} so. But still things are sort of upside down. The most ultra-exclusive set there is the [...] "Missionary Crowd." [...] It comes with rather a shock to learn that in Hawaii the obscure martyrdom-seeking missionary sits {{at the head of}} the table of the moneyed aristocracy. But it is true. The humble New Englanders who came out in the third decade of the nineteenth century, came for the lofty purpose of teaching the kanakas the true religion, the worship of the one only genuine and undeniable God. So well did they succeed in this, and also in civilizing the kanaka, that by the second or third generation he was practically extinct. This being the fruit of the seed of the Gospel, the fruit of the seed of the missionaries (the sons and the grandsons) was the possession of the islands themselves,--of the land, the ports, the town sites, and the sugar plantations: The missionary who came to give the bread of life remained to <b>gobble</b> <b>up</b> the whole heathen feast.|$|E

6000|$|The {{family were}} prejudiced against him. What {{did he want}} there? It was surely some {{sinister}} motive impelled him. He was probably watching {{for an opportunity to}} <b>gobble</b> <b>up</b> the goldfish. We took his part, however, and strenuously defended his moral character, and patronized him in all ways. We gave him the name of Unke, and maintained that he was a well-conducted, philosophical old water- sprite, who showed his good taste in wanting to take up his abode in our conservatory. We even defended his personal appearance, praised the invisible-green coat which he wore on his back, and his gray vest, and solemn gold spectacles; and though he always felt remarkably slimy when we touched him, yet, as he would sit still and allow us to stroke his head and pat his back, we concluded his social feelings might be warm, notwithstanding a cold exterior. Who knew, after all, but he might be a beautiful young prince, enchanted there till the princess should come to drop the golden ball into the fountain, and so {{give him a chance to}} marry her and turn into a man again? Such things, we are credibly informed, are matters of frequent occurrence in Germany. Why not here? ...|$|E
60|$|The Interpreter then replied, This robin is an emblem, very apt to {{set forth}} some professors by; for to sight, they are, as this robin, pretty of note, colour, and carriage. They seem also {{to have a}} very great love for professors that are sincere; and above all other, to desire to sociate with them, and to be in their company, as if they could live upon the good man's crumbs. They pretend also, that {{therefore}} it is that they frequent the house of the godly, and the appointments of the Lord; but, when they are by themselves, as the robin, they can catch and <b>gobble</b> <b>up</b> spiders, they can change their diet, drink iniquity, and swallow down sin like water.[82] So, when they were come again into the house, because supper as yet was not ready, Christiana again desired that the Interpreter would either show or tell of some other things that are profitable. Then the Interpreter began, and said, The fatter the sow is, the more she desires the mire; the fatter the ox is, the more gamesomely he goes to the slaughter; and the more healthy the lusty man is, the more prone he is unto evil.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{will tell}} you the truth about Innocent Smith," [...] said Michael Moon in a low voice. [...] "Dr. Warner has gone to look for him in vain. He is not there. Haven't you noticed that we never saw him since we found ourselves? He was an astral baby born on all four of us; he was only our own youth returned. Long before poor old Warner had clambered out of his cab, the thing we called Smith had {{dissolved}} into dew and light on this lawn. Once or twice more, by the mercy of God, we may feel the thing, but the man we shall never see. In a spring garden before breakfast we shall smell the smell called Smith. In the snapping of brisk twigs in tiny fires we shall hear a noise named Smith. Everything insatiable and innocent in the grasses that <b>gobble</b> <b>up</b> the earth like babies at a bun feast, in the white mornings that split the sky as a boy splits up white firwood, we may feel for one instant the presence of an impetuous purity; but his innocence was too close to the unconsciousness of inanimate things not to melt back at a mere touch into the mild hedges and heavens; he--" ...|$|E

5000|$|Perhaps predictably for a psych track, 'It's Working' is {{also about}} drugs. What's more curious, however, is that it's not about LSD. It's about all the ecstasy the boys regret <b>gobbling</b> <b>up</b> in the early throes of their success." ...|$|R
