5|$|Before the war, Palluth, a {{lecturer}} in the 1929 secret Poznań University cryptology course, had been co-owner of AVA, which produced equipment for the Cipher Bureau, and knew many details of the decryption technology. In Warsaw, under German occupation, other Cipher Bureau workers were interrogated by German intelligence commissions, and some AVA workers were approached by German agents, but all <b>kept</b> <b>silent</b> about compromises to Enigma.|$|E
5|$|In 1946, Childe left Edinburgh {{to take up}} the {{position}} as Director and Professor of European Prehistory at the Institute of Archaeology (IOA) in London. Anxious to return to the capital, he had <b>kept</b> <b>silent</b> over his disapproval of government policies so {{that he would not be}} prevented from getting the job. He took up residence at Lawn Road Flats near to Hampstead.|$|E
5|$|One {{hundred and}} sixty-two Puerto Ricans of the 65th Infantry were arrested. Between 23 November and 26 December 1952, ninety-five {{soldiers}} were court martialed and tried by General Court-Martial in fifteen separate trials. Ninety-one {{were found guilty}} and sentenced to prison terms ranging from one to 18 years of hard labor. It was the largest mass court-martial of the Korean War. According to cultural historian Silvia Álvarez Curbelo, the government of Puerto Rico, {{caught in the middle}} of a potentially damaging affair that could jeopardize its political agenda, <b>kept</b> <b>silent</b> for nearly two months. Finally, the incidents were made known by a local newspaper alerted by several letters written by the imprisoned soldiers to their families. Secret negotiations between the U.S. and Puerto Rican governments took place and the Secretary of the Army Robert T. Stevens moved quickly to remit the sentences and granted clemency and pardons to all those involved.|$|E

5|$|The {{next few}} years were filled with travel and writing. There were further cruises with the {{training}} squadron, and extended visits to the Baltic and the Mediterranean. In 1893, {{during the course of}} one of these journeys, Markham was elected in absentia President of the RGS. This unexpected elevation {{was the result of a}} dispute within the Society over the question of women members, about which Markham had <b>kept</b> <b>silent.</b> When in July 1893 the issue was put to a special general meeting, the proposal to admit women was narrowly defeated despite an overwhelming postal ballot in favour. In these circumstances the Society's President, Sir Mountstuart Elphinstone Grant Duff, resigned his office. The 22 existing women members were allowed to remain, but no more were admitted until January 1913 when the RGS changed its policy. Although Markham was not the first choice as a replacement for Grant Duff—other notable figures were approached—he had kept out of the women members controversy and was broadly acceptable to the membership. Shortly after his accession to the presidency, in recognition of his services to geography Markham was raised in the Order of the Bath to the rank of Knight Commander (KCB), and became Sir Clements Markham.|$|E
25|$|Arcadius died in 408 and his eight-year-old son, Theodosius II was thereupon proclaimed emperor in the East. In {{the same}} year, Honorius enacted {{a law that}} {{prohibited}} anyone who was not Catholic from performing imperial service within the palace. Zosimus reports that Honorius was forced to repeal this law after {{one of his best}} officers, who was a pagan, resigned in protest. At {{the beginning of the year}} 409, Honorius enacted a law that punished judges and officials who did not enforce the laws against the pagans. This law even punished men of rank who simply <b>kept</b> <b>silent</b> over any pagan rite performed in their own city or district.|$|E
25|$|Writer R. Marchal {{identifies}} two {{key events}} in Sino-African relations. First, the Tian'anmen protests in 1989; the spectacle consolidated opposition {{to what was}} perceived as the PRC's violent oppression of demonstrators. Economically developed nations threatened to enforce economic sanctions, while African countries <b>kept</b> <b>silent,</b> either to conceal their own harsh policies or to further their ties with China. Indeed, that was the results as China's strengthened its cooperation with African states. The growing alliance between China and Africa was more and more needed for both sides. China's growing industry resulted in a rapidly expanding and seemingly inexhaustible demand for resources. Meanwhile, in the relative calm ushered in {{by the end of the}} cold war, concerns about human rights issues in China, furthered isolated the mix of rogue and pariah states.|$|E

25|$|Although the 2009 Iranian presidential {{election}} was widely disputed, Ban Ki-moon sent a traditional congratulation {{message to the}} Iranian president upon his inauguration. He <b>kept</b> <b>silent</b> over the request of Shirin Ebadi to visit Iran after the crackdown on peaceful post-election protests by the Iranian police, which was perceived as a crime against humanity. More than 4,000 people were arrested and nearly 70 were killed, some while being held in prison. In another incident, several prominent intellectuals, including Akbar Ganji, Hamid Dabashi and Noam Chomsky, went on a three-day hunger strike {{in front of the}} UN. The incident was followed by an official request by more than 200 intellectuals, human rights activists and reformist politicians in Iran for the UN reaction. Ban Ki-moon however did not take any action to stop the violence in Iran.|$|E

500|$|The American fleet {{was fired}} upon by a Korean fort, {{but there was}} little damage. Rogers gave the Korean {{government}} ten days to apologize or begin talks, but the Royal Court <b>kept</b> <b>silent.</b> After ten days passed, on June 10, Rogers began a series of amphibious assaults that destroyed 5 Korean forts. These military engagements were known as the Battle of Ganghwa. Several hundred Korean soldiers and three Americans were killed. Korea still refused to negotiate, and the American fleet sailed away. The Koreans refer to this 1871 U.S. military action as Shinmiyangyo. [...] President Grant defended Rogers in his third annual message to Congress in December, 1871. After a change in regimes in Seoul, in 1881, the U.S. negotiated a treaty – the first treaty between Korea and a Western nation.|$|E
500|$|The {{young couple}} moved to Chicago where Gygax {{continued}} as a shipping clerk at Kemper Insurance, and also found Mary Jo a job there too. (The company laid her off {{when she became}} pregnant with their first child.) [...] At Mary Jo's insistence, he also attended night classes in junior college to earn his high school diploma, {{and this time he}} excelled at his studies and made the college's Dean's List. He also took anthropology classes at the University of Chicago. Gygax also volunteered as a Republican precinct captain during the 1960 presidential election, and observed many infractions by his Democratic counterpart. When he threatened to report these, he was offered a full scholarship to the University of Chicago if he <b>kept</b> <b>silent.</b> Although Gygax ultimately did not report the infractions, since he felt nothing would be done, he also did not accept the scholarship.|$|E

500|$|The October 2004 league match, staged at Old Trafford, was blighted by {{a number}} of fouls, {{overlooked}} by referee Mike Riley, including striker Van Nistelrooy's studs-up challenge on Cole. Arsenal dictated much of the play, but as the game headed towards the finish, United threatened. The home side were awarded a penalty when Wayne Rooney was adjudged to have been fouled in the area by Campbell. Van Nistelrooy scored and late in the game Rooney scored to give United a 2–0 win. Tempers flared in the tunnel afterwards; Wenger confronted Van Nistelrooy for his tackle on Cole, but Ferguson intervened and told him to leave his players alone. Pizza was thrown at Ferguson by an Arsenal player, which forced him to change into the club tracksuit in order to carry out his television duties. An investigation into [...] "Pizzagate" [...] never came around as both clubs <b>kept</b> <b>silent.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 1999, Team Ninja {{started work}} on the [...] "Next-Generation Ninja Gaiden Project". The first stage of {{development}} was to create the game on the Sega NAOMI arcade system board. They then planned to move the project to the Dreamcast console for further development and release, but this was abandoned when Sega announced the end of Dreamcast product line in 2001. At this point, Tecmo decided to release Ninja Gaiden as a launch title for the Sony PlayStation 2 in the United States. Itagaki, however, had other plans; the Team Ninja Leader {{was impressed with the}} software development kits for the Xbox and pushed for his team to develop for the Microsoft console. The company <b>kept</b> <b>silent</b> on this change in direction, and surprised both the games industry and fans when they announced at E3 2002 that Ninja Gaiden would be released exclusively on the Xbox gaming console. Most fans who voted on Tecmo's poll wanted the game on the Nintendo GameCube.|$|E
500|$|When The Motion Picture was announced, many {{synthesizer}} artists submitted demo {{tapes to}} Paramount. Ramsay and Wise consulted {{and decided that}} the film should have a unique audio style; they were particularly concerned with avoiding sounds that had become pervasive and clichéd due to repetitious use in other science fiction movies. Events such as Enterprise bridge viewscreen activation were <b>kept</b> <b>silent</b> {{to provide a more}} comfortable atmosphere. In contrast, almost every action on the Klingon bridge made noise to reflect the aliens' harsh aesthetic. While much of the effects were created using digital synthesizers, acoustic recordings were used as well. The wormhole's sucking sounds were created by slowing down and reversing old Paramount stock footage of a cowboy fight, while the warp acceleration [...] "stretch" [...] sound was built on a slowed-down cymbal crash. The crew encountered difficulty in transferring the [...] tapes used for creating the sounds to the 35mm film used for the final prints; while the film was to be released with Dolby sound, Serafine found it was easier to mix the sounds without regard to format and add the specific format after, during the later transfer to 35mm.|$|E

500|$|While in prison, Cox mailed several {{letters to}} the St. Petersburg Times in 2008 in which he accused {{politician}} Kevin White of taking bribes from him during Cox's criminal career. He claims he made payoffs to White, an ultimately successful candidate for the Tampa City Council, in 2002 and 2003. Cox said White {{told him he could}} not receive the money directly, and suggested that Cox have friends donate $500 each, and then reimburse them. Records and statements from those who donated show that Cox did in fact make numerous contributions to White's campaign, and reimbursed others who did so as well. White, he claims, agreed to vote to rezone vacant properties in Tampa and Ybor City. When Cox was first arrested, the FBI talked to him about White, whom they were also investigating, and he told them the same information. He claimed to have paid him $7,000 in cash in addition to the recorded contributions he arranged. When White and a fellow City Council member were told Cox's contributions might have been illegal in 2004, his colleague told the police, while White <b>kept</b> <b>silent.</b> White has denied that he knew these contributions were reimbursed, and called Cox's accusations [...] "the jailhouse ramblings of a reputed con man." [...] White said he befriended Cox when he came to believe the con man was interested in revitalizing Tampa Heights. Cox had fled the Tampa area before White cast any rezoning votes, so there is no voting record which could help confirm the validity of his accusations. In 2012, White, who had gone on to serve as Hillsborough County Commissioner, was convicted of unrelated federal bribery and corruption charges and sentenced to three years in federal prison.|$|E
500|$|In England in {{the spring}} of 1846, she met Giuseppe Mazzini, who had been in exile there from Italy since 1837. Fuller also met the Italian revolutionary Giovanni Angelo Ossoli, a marquis who had been disinherited by his family because of his support for Mazzini. Fuller and Ossoli moved in {{together}} in Florence, Italy, likely before they were married, though whether they ever married is uncertain. Fuller was originally opposed to marrying him, {{in part because of the}} difference in their religions; she was Protestant and he was Roman Catholic. Emerson speculated that the couple was [...] "married perhaps in Oct. Nov. or Dec" [...] of 1847, though he did not explain his reasoning. Biographers have speculated that the couple married on April 4, 1848, to celebrate the anniversary of their first meeting but one biographer provided evidence they first met on April 1 during the ceremony called [...] "Lavanda degli Altari" [...] (Altars Lavage). By the time the couple moved to Florence, they were referred to as husband and wife, though it is unclear if any formal ceremony took place. It seems certain that at the time their child was born, they were not married. By New Year's Day 1848, she suspected that she was pregnant but kept it from Ossoli for several weeks. Their child, Angelo Eugene Philip Ossoli, was born in early September 1848 and nicknamed Angelino. The couple was very secretive about their relationship but, after Angelino suffered an unnamed illness, they became less so. Fuller informed her mother about Ossoli and Angelino in August 1849 in a letter that explained that she had <b>kept</b> <b>silent</b> so as not to upset her [...] "but it has become necessary, on account of the child, for us to live publicly and permanently together." [...] Her mother's response makes it clear that she was aware that the couple was not legally married.
