The liquid mixture then {{goes into a}} [...] "reactor" [...] which is a long chamber {{with a series of}} strong UV lights. The UV radiation drives the polymerization and cross-linking reactions. The resulting [...] "logs" [...] are sticky gels containing 60-70% water. The logs are shredded or ground and placed in various sorts of driers. Additional cross-linking agent may be sprayed on the particles' surface; this [...] "surface cross-linking" [...] increases the product's ability to swell under pressure—a property measured as Absorbency Under Load (AUL) or Absorbency Against Pressure (AAP). The dried polymer particles are then screened for proper particle size distribution and packaging. The gel polymerization (GP) method is currently the most popular method for making the sodium polyacrylate superabsorbent polymers now used in baby diapers and other disposable <b>hygienic</b> <b>articles.</b>|$|E
40|$|Biosensors {{representing}} the technological counterpart of living senses have found routine application in amperometric enzyme electrodes for decentralized blood glucose measurement, interaction analysis by surface plasmon resonance in drug development, {{and to some}} extent DNA chips for expression analysis and enzyme polymorphisms. These technologies have already reached a highly advanced level and need minor improvement at most. The dream of the " 100 -dollar" personal genome may come true {{in the next few years}} provided that the technological hurdles of nanopore technology or of polymerase-based single molecule sequencing can be overcome. Tailor-made recognition elements for biosensors including membrane-bound enzymes and receptors will be prepared by cell-free protein synthesis. As alternatives for biological recognition elements, molecularly imprinted polymers (MIPs) have been created. They have the potential to substitute antibodies in biosensors and biochips for the measurement of low-molecular-weight substances, proteins, viruses, and living cells. They are more stable than proteins and can be produced in large amounts by chemical synthesis. Integration of nanomaterials, especially of graphene, could lead to new miniaturized biosensors with high sensitivity and ultrafast response. In the future individual therapy will include genetic profiling of isoenzymes and polymorphic forms of drug-metabolizing enzymes especially of the cytochrome P 450 family. For defining the pharmacokinetics including the clearance of a given genotype enzyme electrodes will be a useful tool. For decentralized online patient control or the integration into everyday "consumables" such as drinking water, foods, <b>hygienic</b> <b>articles,</b> clothing, or for control of air conditioners in buildings and cars and swimming pools, a new generation of "autonomous" biosensors will emerge...|$|E
40|$|During {{excavations}} of the nunnery of Vreta, {{a number}} of artefacts for medical and hygienic use were found, including medical vessels, a clasp-knife, different types of forceps, phlebotomy knives and a surgical sharp hook. The artefacts show that medical and most probably some surgical activity has taken place there. Compared to other Swedish Cistercian monasteries, as the nunnery of Gudhem and the male institutions of Alvastra and Varnhem, it is clear, though, that artefacts for medical and hygienic use are both more abundant and more differentiated concerning type at the male institutions. Most notably missing from the female institutions are specialized articles used for cleansing wounds, like curettes and probes, and <b>hygienic</b> <b>articles,</b> like ear scopes and tooth-picks/nail-cleaners. In this paper, possible explanations for this phenomenon are discussed and I argue that the answer might lie in gender differentiated forms of experiencing and expressing piety and advanced spirituality. The medieval idea of the female constitution as more physical than the male may {{have had an impact}} on women’s religious ideals, apprehensions and experiences, towards a higher inclination amongst religious women to use physical ascetics as a way to attain elevated spirituality. Certain diseases and physical complaints might therefore to a lesser extent have been seen as called for to cure when suffered by religious women than when suffered by religious men. I also propose that as women were conceived to be closer to nature, they might have been expected to have larger endurance concerning certain physical ills. I suggest that what is reflected in the archaeological materials from Swedish female and male Cistercian monasteries is a higher inclination among pious women to include the neglecting of wounds and other diseases with equivalent symptoms, as well as certain everyday hygienic practices, in the physical ascetics of dedicated religiosity...|$|E

40|$|This is {{the first}} of two {{articles}} exploring in depth some of the early organizational strategies that were marshalled in efforts to found and develop the German Research Institute of Psychiatry (Deutsche Forschungsanstalt fur Psychiatrie) in 1917. After briefly discussing plans for a German research institute before World War I, the article examines the political strategies and networks that Emil Kraepelin used to recruit support for the institute. It argues that his efforts at psychiatric governance can best be understood as a form of volkisch corporatism which sought to mobilize and coordinate a group of players in the service of higher biopolitical and <b>hygienic</b> ends. The <b>article</b> examines the wartime arguments used to justify the institute, the list of protagonists actively engaged in recruiting financial and political support, the various social, scientific and political networks that they exploited, and the local contingencies that had to be negotiated in order to found the research institute...|$|R
40|$|One of {{parameters}} {{which should}} be controlled and annually logged in the territories radiation hygiene passports is the total volume beta activity of the atmospheric air {{in the form of}} an average annual value in Bq/m 3 units. On different years in the territories radiation hygiene passports there were logged the data on the content of certain radionuclides; however the data on the atmospheric air total volume beta activity were the most informative in all the years. In majority of territories these data are obtained by the Federal Hydrometeorology and Environmental Monitoring Service divisions, in some Russian Federation entities the measurements are carried out by Rospotrebnadzor bodies. However, in the recent years in most Russian Federation entities radiation hygiene passports there are entered design values of the air total volume beta activity, derived using the method of averaging the data on geographic areas. This article is an attempt to generalize the data on the air total volume beta activity in radiation hygiene passports of the Russian Federation entities, to assess long-term stability of this parameter and opportunity to establish numerical values which may be used as a reference at atmospheric air radiation <b>hygienic</b> monitoring. The <b>article</b> proves that at normal operation of radiation objects on the territory of some Russian Federation entities (excluding zones of large radiation objects supervision in these territories) the atmospheric air average annual total volume beta activity value is stable enough. It is determined that on some years the parameter average annual values in the territories of Saint-Petersburg, Krasnoyarsk region and Khanty-Mansi autonomous region – Yugra differ up to 50 % from the average levels derived by long-term observation. The atmospheric air average annual total volume beta activity numerical values assessment is obtained; these values may be accepted as reference levels at atmospheric air radiation hygienic monitoring. Possible reasons are analyzed of atmospheric air total volume beta activity level distinctions on the territory of considered Russian Federation entities.  </p...|$|R
