40|$|Sleep {{concerns}} everyone, {{and therefore}} {{it is good to}} know basic information about it. Sleep disorders might lead to a significant reduction in quality of life and may be an activator of serious mental disorders that may lead to disruption of interpersonal relationships. This bachelor work deals with the sleep of the children, who are members in the scout organization - Scouts and Guides Association CR, Center Orion Kladno. Using questionnaires, I have tried to ascertain the quality and length of their sleep, time of <b>going</b> <b>to</b> bed, <b>getting</b> <b>up</b> time, sleep hygiene and whether they suffer from sleep disorders. Children replies are compared with the answers of their parents. The results will lead to a set of rules about sleeping at scouting expeditions of our club...|$|R

5000|$|Intensive probation, home detention, GPS monitoring, Computer ManagementThese {{are highly}} {{intrusive}} forms of probation {{in which the}} offender is very closely monitored. It is common for violent criminals, higher-ranking gang members, habitual offenders, and sex offenders to be supervised at this level. Some jurisdictions require offenders under such supervision to waive their constitutional rights under the Fourth Amendment regarding search and seizure, and such probationers {{may be subject to}} unannounced home or workplace visits, surveillance, and the use of electronic monitoring or satellite tracking. Under terms of this kind of probation, a client may not change their living address and must stay at the address that is known to probation. GPS monitoring and home detention are common in juvenile cases, even if the underlying delinquency is minor. Some types of supervision may entail installing some form of monitoring software and/or conducting computer searches to ascertain what an offender is doing online. Cybercrime specialist in corrections, Art Bowker, noted “This is an area more and more community corrections officers are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> have <b>to</b> <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> speed on, learning how to enforce conditions that restrict and/or monitor cyber offenders' computer and internet use.” Bowker, also observed [...] "The use of social media is taking off in the field of community corrections." ...|$|R

50|$|The Fellow {{first came}} to {{prominence}} in Britain when he ran in the 1990 King George VI Chase as a young five-year-old, although the previous month he had won the Group One Prix La Haye Jousselin at Auteuil Hippodrome in France. He {{finished third in the}} King George behind Desert Orchid and Toby Tobias, then ran in a French hurdle race before returning to the UK to run in the Cheltenham Gold Cup. He was still a young horse and went off at 28/1. However, despite his age he was only beaten a short-head into second place by Garrison Savannah and defeated a number of good horses including Desert Orchid, Cool Ground and Celtic Shot. In fact, BBC commentator Sir Peter O'Sullevan (possibly biased through being a friend of the horse's owner) thought that The Fellow was <b>going</b> <b>to</b> just <b>get</b> <b>up</b> <b>to</b> win the race.|$|R
5000|$|During the Giuliani administration, police {{conducted}} sweeps {{of parks}} {{and other public}} places to arrest homeless people and move them to shelters. Critics charged that the purpose was not to help the homeless but to remove them from sight. The pastor of Fifth Avenue Presbyterian Church, Reverend Thomas Tewell, said: [...] "I think {{the police and the}} administration in New York were a bit embarrassed to have homeless people on the steps of a church in such an affluent area. The city said to us that it's inhumane to have people staying on the streets. And my response was that it's also inhumane to just move them along to another place or to put them in a shelter where they are <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> beat <b>up,</b> or abused, or harassed." [...] The church sued the city of New York, Giuliani, and Bernard Kerik, asserting a First Amendment right to minister to the homeless on its steps.|$|R
