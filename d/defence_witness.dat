25|$|In 1969, after {{hosting a}} trailer for a BBC {{programme}} on VD on his Night Ride programme, Peel received significant media attention because he divulged on air {{that he had}} suffered from a sexually transmitted disease earlier that year.

25|$|In 1911, Douglas embraced Roman Catholicism, as Wilde {{had done}} earlier. More {{than a decade}} after Wilde's death, {{with the release of}} {{suppressed}} portions of Wilde's De Profundis letter in 1912, Douglas turned against his former friend, whose homosexuality he grew to condemn. He was a <b>defence</b> <b>witness</b> in the libel case brought by Maud Allan against Noel Pemberton Billing in 1918. Billing had accused Allan, who was performing Wilde's play Salome, of being part of a homosexual conspiracy to undermine the war effort.|$|E

2500|$|In 1995, {{during an}} {{interview}} with Cliff Saunders broadcast by the SABC, she said [...] "The facts of the matter are [...] I did not {{do any of the}} things of which I was accused by paid witnesses." [...] She was soon interviewed by Lin Sampson for Playboy and reinforced her disagreement with the <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses.</b> In the favourable article, Sampson described the rage against Allan as [...] "the first public showing of what would become the new South African psychosis". Sunday Times <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses</b> were said to be irate that their shared publisher, Times Media, published the article. The newspaper proceeded to publish an extract of the interview to promote its sister magazine sales.|$|R
2500|$|Reforms {{are made}} {{to the extent to}} which the defence must {{disclose}} their case in order to trigger both the revised duty to disclose and the right to a [...] "section 8" [...] application to the court to force the prosecution to disclose an item of evidence. A defence statement must now state each point at which issue is taken with the prosecution and why, any particular defence or points of law (such as evidential admissibility or abuse of process) upon which he or she would rely. The defendant must also give a list of <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses,</b> along with their names and addresses. The police may then interview those witnesses, according to a code of practice issued by the Home Secretary. The Explanatory Notes make it clear the police interviewing of potential <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses</b> is one of the intents of the Act. The details of any <b>defence</b> expert <b>witness</b> instructed must also be given to the prosecution, whether or not they are then used in the case. However, no part of the Act explicitly amends the law on legal privilege, so the contents of any correspondence or expert report would remain confidential to the same extent as before.|$|R
25|$|When Rundstedt {{learned that}} he was not to be tried {{personally}} at Nuremberg, he wrote to the Tribunal asking permission to appear as a <b>defence</b> <b>witness</b> for the Army high command. In May 1946 he was summoned to appear. When he left Island Farm, all the 185 senior officers being held there lined up to salute him. On 19 June he appeared before a preliminary hearing of the IMT Commission. Since he was a witness, not a defendant, the questioning was not intended to prove Rundstedt's guilt: it was designed to bolster the prosecution's case that the high command had functioned as an organisation and that it was collectively responsible for the German invasions of various countries between 1939 and 1941 and also for the war crimes committed during those invasions. Rundstedt was adamant that the high command played no part in the decisions to invade Poland, Norway, France or the Soviet Union. He insisted that the Army had obeyed the laws of war and was not responsible for the actions of the Einsatzgruppen. He also denied that the Army had deliberately starved three million Soviet prisoners-of-war to death in 1941–42.|$|E
500|$|During the Nuremberg Trials, Waffen-SS personnel, such as Hausser in his {{testimony}} as a <b>defence</b> <b>witness,</b> contended {{that it was a}} purely military organisation no different from the Wehrmacht. The prosecution at Nuremberg rejected that claim and successfully argued that the Waffen-SS {{was an integral part of}} the SS apparatus. The Tribunal found that [...] "the units of the Waffen-SS were directly involved in the killings of the prisoners of war and the atrocities in the occupied countries" [...] and judged the entire SS to be a criminal organisation.|$|E
500|$|Takanohana also {{condemned}} {{his mother}} for her extramarital affair, {{which led to}} her divorce from Futagoyama and exit from the stable in July 2001, and had only been rumoured up to that point. She has now reverted to her old name of Noriko Fujita and published a book and appeared on TV, revealing details {{of life as a}} stablemaster's wife that are seldom heard outside the sumo world. Takanohana has rarely spoken to her since. In June 2008 he spoke of his distress at the news that she had been named as a <b>defence</b> <b>witness</b> in a civil lawsuit brought by the Sumo Association against the tabloid magazine Shūkan Gendai over allegations that his father benefited from a thrown match for the championship in 1975, saying, [...] "she will essentially be fighting against me." [...] He said he would take responsibility by resigning from the Sumo Association if she took the stand. In a radio interview Fujita said she would not testify, saying, [...] "I will not drag my child down".|$|E
50|$|If {{there is}} no {{discharge}} at end of the state case, the defence presents its case. It may deliver an opening address, if it desires, and then call the accused and any witnesses it chooses. The state cross-examines these <b>witnesses,</b> and the <b>defence</b> may re-examine them. The accused is usually obliged to testify before <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses.</b>|$|R
5|$|Diefenbaker won {{the local}} people over through his success; {{in his first year}} in practice, he tried 62 jury trials, winning {{approximately}} half of his cases. He rarely called <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses,</b> thereby avoiding the possibility of rebuttal witnesses for the Crown, and securing the last word for himself. In late 1920, {{he was elected to the}} village council to serve a three-year term.|$|R
50|$|No {{trial was}} held in open court; rather, the {{proceedings}} were conducted inside the jail in which Roy was held. Roy was allowed neither trial by jury nor <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses,</b> nor was he allowed to make a defence statement. Proceedings were conducted from 3 November 1931 until 9 January 1932, at which time Roy was sentenced to 12 years of rigorous imprisonment.|$|R
500|$|Euston {{was in fact}} {{still in}} England and {{immediately}} filed a case against Parke for libel. At the trial, Euston admitted that when walking along Piccadilly a tout {{had given him a}} card which read [...] "Poses plastiques. C. Hammond, 19 Cleveland Street". Euston testified that he went to the house believing Poses plastiques meant a display of female nudes. He paid a sovereign to get in but upon entering Euston said he was appalled to discover the [...] "improper" [...] nature of the place and immediately left. The defence witnesses contradicted each other, and could not describe Euston accurately. The final <b>defence</b> <b>witness,</b> John Saul, was a male prostitute who had earlier been involved in a homosexual scandal at Dublin Castle, and featured in a clandestinely published erotic novel The Sins of the Cities of the Plain which was cast as his autobiography. Delivering his testimony in a manner described as [...] "brazen effrontery", Saul admitted to earning his living by leading an [...] "immoral life" [...] and [...] "practising criminality", and detailed his alleged sexual encounters with Euston at the house. The defence did not call either Newlove or Veck as witnesses, and could not produce any evidence that Euston had left the country. On 16 January 1890, the jury found Parke guilty and the judge sentenced him to twelve months in prison. One historian considers Euston was telling the truth and only visited Cleveland Street once because he was misled by the card. However, another has alleged Euston was a well-known figure in the homosexual underworld, and was extorted so often by the notorious blackmailer Robert Cliburn, that Oscar Wilde had quipped Cliburn deserved the Victoria Cross for his tenacity. Saul stated that he told the police his story in August, which provoked the judge to enquire rhetorically why the authorities had not taken action.|$|E

Palmer expressed his admiration for Cockburn's cross-examination after the verdict through the racing metaphor [...] "It was the riding that did it." ...|$|E
25|$|The trial was, at the time, {{the longest}} {{obscenity}} trial in British legal history, {{and it was}} the first time that an obscenity charge was combined with the charge of conspiring to corrupt public morals. <b>Defence</b> <b>witnesses</b> included artist Feliks Topolski, comedian Marty Feldman, artist and drugs activist Caroline Coon, DJ John Peel, musician and writer George Melly, legal philosopher Ronald Dworkin and academic Edward de Bono.|$|R
5000|$|One of the <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses</b> was {{genetics}} specialist Professor Michael Patton, {{who testified}} that several cot {{deaths in the}} same family could be caused by an undiscovered genetic defect, and that the chances of experiencing more than one cot death could be as high as one in twenty. The court heard evidence that Patel's maternal grandmother lost five children in infancy, but that her remaining seven children were [...] "alive and well".|$|R
25|$|Masood, {{wearing black}} clothes, {{got out of}} the car and ran around the corner into Parliament Square and through the open Carriage Gates where he fatally stabbed an unarmed police officer, PC Keith Palmer. An armed police officer, {{believed}} to have been the Metropolitan Police close protection officer for Michael Fallon, the Secretary of State for <b>Defence,</b> <b>witnessed</b> the stabbing, ran towards the scene and shot Masood dead. The entire attack, from start to finish, lasted 82 seconds.|$|R
2500|$|After the Bismarck action, Tovey {{resisted}} {{moves to}} court-martial the Prince of Wales' captain, John Leach, and Frederic Wake-Walker, the admiral commanding Suffolk and Norfolk, who had broken off {{the battle with}} Bismarck after Hood had been sunk. Tovey was appalled and a row ensued between Tovey and his superior, Pound. Tovey stated that the two officers had acted correctly in the circumstances. He threatened to resign his position and appear at any court-martial as 'defendant's friend' and <b>defence</b> <b>witness.</b> No more was heard of the proposal. King George V was extremely short of fuel and had stayed at the scene far longer than Tovey had thought it could, so another cause for friction between Tovey and his political and professional superiors was a signal that his flagship was to remain in action until Bismarck had sunk, [...] "Bismarck must be sunk at all costs ... even if it ... means towing King George V". In these circumstances {{it would have been}} highly likely that the ship would have been lost to either u-boats or aircraft. The signal had initially caused amusement amongst Tovey and his staff, but later its risks and implications angered them; Tovey later said [...] "It was the stupidest and most ill-considered signal ever made" [...] and {{he made it clear that}} he would have disobeyed and risked court-martial.|$|E
2500|$|The leading Defence counsel Sir Frederick Geoffrey Lawrence, QC, {{had been}} briefed by the Medical Defence Union with the {{additional}} task of obtaining a ruling on whether medical treatments that might shorten {{the life of a}} terminally ill patient were legal. Lawrence, a [...] "specialist in real estate and divorce cases [...] a relative stranger in criminal court", who was defending his first murder trial, convinced the jury that {{there was no evidence that}} a murder had been committed, much less that a murder had been committed by Adams. He emphasised that the indictment was based mainly on testimonies from the nurses who tended Morrell – and that none of the witnesses' evidence matched the others'. Then, on the second day of the trial, he produced notebooks written by the nurses, detailing Adams' treatment of Morrell. The prosecution claimed never to have seen these notebooks (even though they are recorded in pretrial lists of evidence). These differed from the nurses' recollection of events, and showed that smaller quantities of drugs were given to the patient than the prosecution had thought, based on Adams' prescriptions. Furthermore, the prosecution's two expert medical witnesses gave differing opinions: Arthur Douthwaite was prepared to say that murder had definitely been committed (though he changed his mind in the middle of his testimony regarding the exact date), but Michael Ashby was more reticent. The <b>defence</b> <b>witness</b> and physician John Harman was adamant that Adams's treatment, though unusual, was not reckless. Finally, the prosecution was wrong-footed by the defence not calling the loquacious Adams to give evidence, and thereby avoiding him [...] "chatting himself to the gallows". This was unexpected, shocking the prosecution and the press, and even surprising the judge.|$|E

40|$|In 2011 three Congolese ICC <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses</b> {{applied for}} asylum in the Netherlands. A {{decision}} {{has not yet}} been made. This article argues that three outcomes of their procedures are most likely: (i) an asylum permit is granted, (ii) a permit is denied, or (iii) the applicants are excluded from refugee protection on the basis of Article 1 (f) (a). All scenarios would have serious practical and political consequences for the ICC, the Netherlands, and the DRC. There is a limited, but real, chance that future <b>defence</b> <b>witnesses</b> will also apply for asylum. This mere threat might already seriously hamper future co-operation between the ICC and states parties. More practical and political dilemmas stemming from a lack of harmonization between international criminal law and principles of international protection lie ahead, since a coherent scheme {{on how to deal with}} ICC defendants whose case has been rejected in the pre-trial phase, who have been acquitted, or who have served their sentence and cannot be refouled to their country of origin has thus far not been realized.

However, Slater's lawyers organised a petition, signed by 20,000 people, and the secretary for Scotland, Lord Pentland, issued a conditional pardon and commuted the sentence to life imprisonment.
