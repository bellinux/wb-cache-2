It is important to also note the differences in methodology used to obtain these statistics, as some include deaths during attempted arrests while others do not. Other research has focused on specific states, such as Maryland and the rate of death by identity (gender, race, age).

Nevertheless, the Order in question still retains the norm stipulating that “letters (that contain - author) the data which cannot be divulged, are not sent to the addressee, nor returned to the convicts or <b>individuals</b> in <b>custody,</b> but confiscated”. It means that а) CF administration is obliged to reveal this information by reading the letters; b) any information can be lawfully classified as “the data which cannot be divulged” at the administration’s discretion, thus opening the door to all sorts of local abuse.

However, what happens when individuals being read their rights do not fully comprehend the significance of what the police are telling them, whether {{it is because of}} lack of comprehension due to brain development, or susceptibility to the influence of those questioning them? The courts have examined these direct issues when it comes to “voluntary” confessions made by juveniles. Several cases (J. D. B. v. North Carolina, 2011; Yarborough v.

40|$|Abstract Miranda v. Arizona {{requires}} that an <b>individual</b> in <b>custody</b> “be warned prior to any questioning” {{that he or}} she has the right to remain silent, anything he or she says can be used against that individual in a court of law, {{that he or she}} has the right to the presence of an attorney, and, if the individual cannot afford an attorney, one will be appointed for him or her prior to any questioning if the individual so desires. An interaction between law enforcement officials and an individual generally triggers Miranda’s prophylactic warnings when the interaction becomes a “custodial interrogation. ” For Miranda to apply, the defendant must be in custody and subject to interrogation. Many scholars and circuits are currently split on what constitutes a “custodial interrogation” in border situations, when a situation is no longer routine, and at what point law enforcement personnel must give Miranda warnings. By analyzing the circuit split of the application of Miranda rights during border situations, lower courts may now have direction when deciding similar issues and, more importantly, the analysis may signal to the Supreme Court that judicial guidance needs to be developed...|$|R
40|$|The {{virtues of}} privatizing {{security}} in Western Australia {{have been brought}} into question by the much publicized death of an Indigenous elder in Kalgoorlie {{at the beginning of}} 2008. Since that time, there have been a range of instances in WA (and nationally) where the management of prisoner security {{has been the subject of}} intense public debate. In this paper, we examine how a government has difficulty in maintaining control of a private company service when contracting it out, yet retains the ongoing responsibility for its success or failure and the exercise of due diligence. In the area of protecting persons and prisoner security, this includes a duty of care for all those in custody. Much research has attended to the need for private security in various locations, to prescriptions about what they do and to how the practices of security officers or firms should be held accountable. But given that public policies are devised and implemented within a political context where prisoner welfare is not usually afforded a high priority for government, how do we also ensure that looking after <b>individuals</b> in <b>custody</b> and prompting respect for certain standards retains a high place on the political agenda...|$|R

40|$|Linkage to and {{retention}} in medical {{care is a}} concern for HIV-positive <b>individuals</b> leaving <b>custody</b> settings in the United States. The minimal existing research points to low rates of entry into care {{in the months following}} release and lapsed viral control among releasees who are subsequently reincarcerated. We conducted seven small focus group discussions with 27 HIVpositive individuals who were recently incarcerated in a California State prison to understand those factors that facilitated linkage to {{and retention}} in HIV care following their release. We used a consensual approach to code and analyze the focus group transcripts. Four main themes emerged from the analysis: (1) interpersonal relationships, (2) professional relationships, (3) coping strategies and resources, and (4) individual attitudes. Improving HIV-related outcomes among individuals after their release from prison requires strengthening supportive relationships, fostering the appropriate attitudes and skills, and ensuring access to resources that stabilize daily living and facilitate the process of accessing care.
