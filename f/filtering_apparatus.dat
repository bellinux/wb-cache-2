50|$|The main feeding {{strategy}} of D. magna is the filtering of suspended particles. A specialized <b>filtering</b> <b>apparatus,</b> {{formed by the}} thoracic appendixes, generates a water current within the thoracic opening of the carapace which permits the collection and the ingestion of unicellular algae, bacteria and detritus. D. magna can also feed on periphyton and detritus, an ability that can offer a competitive advantage to this species over strictly pelagic filter feeders in some environments where suspended food sources might be temporally limited.|$|E
50|$|Both the James's and Andean {{flamingos}} {{feed their}} chicks through an esophageal secretion that is regurgitated from the crop of the bird. The {{difference between the}} two species lies in the composition of the prolactin secretion produced by each bird. Both male and female parents are able to feed the chick. Adult flamingos are the most developed filter feeders of the birds. Of the species, James's flamingo has the finest filter feeding apparatus. The flamingo feeds on diatoms and other microscopic algae. The shape of the bill is deep keeled. To feed, the flamingos' long legs allow them to walk into the water and swoop their necks down into an S-shape to allow the beak to enter the water. The S-shape is effective because it allows the head to be placed upright and the bottom of the bill to be placed as shallow or as deep as it pleases. By only lowering the distal end of the bill into the water it allows nostrils to remain above water. The water filled with small organisms floods the bill and filtration process begins. The lakes, which the flamingo typically feeds from, are Andean lakes which are mostly freshwater, but if salt water is encountered, the flamingos have salt glands in their nostrils where excess salt is secreted. The filtering process starts with the tongue, which is very soft and fleshy with channel like features that direct the food and water to the <b>filtering</b> <b>apparatus.</b> The bill of James's flamingo is the narrowest of its kind. Both the Andean and James's flamingos have deep-keeled bills where the upper jaw is narrower than the lower. The gape of the bill is therefore on the dorsal side of the bill. The bill of James's flamingo is smaller and has a narrower upper jaw. The proximal end of the bill is mostly horizontal then there is a curvature downward and the distal end finishes with a hook-like feature. The inner morphology of the beak {{is similar to that of}} the lesser flamingo, where the upper and lower jaws contain lamellae which filter the food. In both the upper and lower jaw, the proximal portion of the bill contains lamellae that are ridge-like and as you approach the curvature and distal end they become more like hooks. There are marginal and submarginal lamellae and James's flamingo has the greatest number of both which also means there is a smaller intermarginal distance between them. There are 21 lamellae per cm in this species, which is more than twice the amount found in other flamingos. When the upper and lower jaws close together the lamellae mesh together to allow the bill to be closed fully. The sizes of the diatoms associated with this size <b>filtering</b> <b>apparatus</b> are anywhere from 21-60 μm. Diatoms this size are typically found close to the edge of the water, it has been shown that even in colonies of multiple species the James's flamingos typically feed in the region closest to the edge of the water. The birds are able to use their webbed feet to help kick up microscopic algae if there is not enough floating in the water column.|$|E

40|$|Bighead carp (Hypophthalmichthys nobilis) {{and silver}} carp (H. molitrix) are {{freshwater}} planktivorous fish originated from Eastern Asia, which were introduced {{all over the}} world. Previous studies suggested that bighead carp with comb-like gill rakers feeds mainly on zooplankters, while silver carp with sponge-like <b>filtering</b> <b>apparatus</b> filters smaller particles {{and the majority of}} its diet is composed of phytoplankton. In Lake Balaton, however, the Asian carp stock is formed by the hybrids of these two species, whose <b>filtering</b> <b>apparatus</b> varies within the whole range from comb-like to spongious structures. Since there is no information on how hybridization affects the feeding efficiency of Asian carps, we analysed the relationship between gill raker morphology and food size-distribution in hybrid Asian carps, in Lake Balaton. <b>Filtering</b> <b>apparatus</b> of each sampled fish (n= 26) was characterized by two morphological indexes, assumed to be indicative of feeding efficiency. First, the effective area of the <b>filtering</b> <b>apparatus</b> was measured relative to the respiration organ; the width of the gill raker relative to the width of the gill-filaments was determined at the centre of the gill-arch. Second, density of pores on the outer surface of the spongy gill raker areas was counted, while zero scores were given to comb-like areas. Feeding of fish was determined from the filtrate suspension collected directly from the inner surface of gill rakers. Diet items were identified, counted and classified into three phyto- (> 40 μm, 40 − 10 μm, 1. 3 mm, 1. 3 − 0. 4 mm, < 0. 4 mm) size groups. Contrary to our expectations, no significant relationship was found between the gill raker morphology and phyto- and zooplantonic food size distribution in hybrid Asian carps. Thus, the Asian carp stock, consisting of hybrids with variously mixed phenotypes, consumes similar food, but seasonality has a significant impact on their diet...|$|E

Examination of the water was done for the Enterovirus group of viruses consisting primarily of the Echovirus, Coxsackievirus, and Poliovirus groups.
