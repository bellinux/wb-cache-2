The [...] "VT750C" [...] was available outside of the USA (Canada and Europe) with a larger engine displacement.|$|E
30|$|Objective {{validation}} {{demonstrated that}} the DIMEG motorcycle simulator reproduces with good approximation the physics of a real motorcycle. Subjective validation showed that, {{at the end of}} a trial and error tuning procedure, the audio visual experience and feelings of movement perceived by the rider had been remarkable increased. In particular, the riding experience has been improved by the installation of the visual system using three widescreens and the introduction of <b>foot</b> <b>peg</b> control.|$|E

5000|$|The sporty seating {{position}} {{is similar to}} Honda CBZ 125 F and BMW F650. Reviews have praised the handling of Karizma as [...] "being easy for novice", [...] "impeccable on straights and cornering" [...] and as an [...] "accomplished bike" [...] in ride and handling.

Unlike sport bikes, full handlebars made of tubular aluminum are utilized. For comfort, the saddle contains more than one centimeter of padding between the seat covering and the pan. <b>Foot</b> <b>pegs</b> are positioned similar to standard motorcycles, creating a seating position reminiscent of the classic Universal Japanese Motorcycle (UJM).|$|R
5000|$|In 2003, Victory {{introduced}} the Vegas. The Vegas {{was designed by}} Victory designer Michael Song, and offered a totally new chassis design. The Freedom engine carried forward from the TC, {{but the rest of}} the bike incorporated new features.

2500|$|Cruiser {{the rider}} {{sits at a}} lower seat height with the upper torso upright or leaning {{slightly}} rearward. Legs are extended forwards, sometimes {{out of reach of}} the regular controls on cruiser pegs. The low seat height can be a consideration for new or short riders. Handlebars tend to be high and wide. [...] The emphasis is on comfort, while compromising cornering ability because of low ground clearance and the greater likelihood of scraping <b>foot</b> <b>pegs,</b> floor boards, or other parts if turns are taken at the speeds other motorcycles can more readily accomplish.|$|R
5000|$|The 1980 GS {{model has}} {{a mix of}} German, Japanese and Italian sport bike styling which is simply dubbed [...] "Eurostyle." [...] Cycleworld notes that [...] "the 450's {{suspension}} is not as efficient as {{the handling of the}} bike, yet this bike boasts one of the most soft supple rides of all small engine street bikes that no other bike with the same displacement can match." [...] Because of the low handlebar placement and slightly rear-set <b>foot</b> <b>pegs,</b> the rider is put into a racer position when cornering.|$|R
