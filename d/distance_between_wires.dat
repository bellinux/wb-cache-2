The PV generator is composed of about 200 strings, each of 20 modules connected in parallel. The parallel connection of the strings is carried out using the usual scheme based on two parallel levels. The first parallel level is made from the connection of groups of eight strings in smart string boxes distributed over the field. The second parallel level is made from the connection of each string box output to the DC input of the centralized inverter smart string boxes measure each string current and the common string voltage.

MethodsWe retrospectively reviewed the medical records for 181 patients who had undergone computed tomography–guided nodule localization using hook wire and subsequent video-assisted thoracic surgery resection for lung nodules. The demographic factors, nodule factors, and technical factors were reviewed to determine what affects effective nodule localization for video-assisted thoracic surgery resection using both univariate and multivariate models. ResultsA total of 174 patients were included in our study. Successful localization was accomplished in 166 patients (95 %). Univariate analysis implicated patient age, nodule solidity, zonal location, and a sufficient <b>distance</b> <b>between</b> the hook <b>wire</b> tip and pleural surface as significant factors for successful localization.
