5|$|After {{the first}} salvo from the 15cm {{batteries}} in Drøbak, the steering {{from the bridge}} was disabled. Blücher had just passed Drøbakgrunnen (Drøbak shallows) and was in a turn to port. The commander got her back on track by using the side shafts, but she lost speed. Normally the rudder is controlled electrically from the bridge to the motors <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the Handsteuerraum (hand steering room) deep under the armored deck, <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the rudder. In an emergency it can be switched within seconds to manual steering, but orders from the bridge to the rudder may be delayed. At 04:34 Norwegian land-based torpedo batteries scored two hits on the ship. The targeting device in the torpedo battery was very primitive. The speed of the torpedo was known and set, but {{the speed of the}} target had to be adjusted by dead reckoning (guessing).|$|E
5|$|In {{the initial}} design the battery box and air {{reservoirs}} were located <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the fuel tank; in locomotives manufactured after 1977 these were relocated behind the tank. The battery box {{returned to its}} original location in the F40PH-2. The F40PH-2s delivered to Caltrain incorporated Southern Pacific Railroad-style headlights.|$|E
5|$|Most {{noticeable}} of the N3 {{design was}} {{the concentration of}} the main battery <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the bridge and machinery spaces. A related feature of the design was the tower bridge structure behind the first two gun turrets. This provided a better and more stable foundation for fire-control equipment, greatly improved accommodation and protection from the weather.|$|E

5|$|A five-man crew, {{the first}} pilot, co-pilot, {{navigator}} radar, navigator plotter and air electronics officer (AEO) was accommodated within the pressure cabin on two levels; the pilots sitting on Martin-Baker 3K (3KS on the B.2) ejection seats whilst {{on the lower}} level, the other crew sat facing rearwards and would abandon the aircraft via the entrance door. The original B35/46 specification sought a jettisonable crew compartment, this requirement was removed in a subsequent amendment, the rear crew's escape system was often an issue of controversy, such as when a practical refit scheme was rejected. A rudimentary sixth seat <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the navigator radar was provided for an additional crew member; the B.2 had an additional seventh seat opposite the sixth seat and <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the AEO. These seats {{were no more than}} cushions, a full harness and an oxygen and intercom facility. The visual bomb-aimer's compartment could be fitted with a T4 (Blue Devil) bombsight, in many B.2s this space housed a vertically mounted Vinten F95 Mk.10 camera for assessing simulated low-level bombing runs.|$|E
5|$|Adding to {{the inner}} {{complexities}} of the picture and creating further visual interactions is the male dwarf in the foreground, whose raised hand echoes the gesture of {{the figure in the}} background, while his playful demeanour, and distraction from the central action, are in complete contrast with it. The informality of his pose, his shadowed profile, and his dark hair all serve to make him a mirror image to the kneeling attendant of the Infanta. However, the painter has set him <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the light streaming through the window, and so minimised the contrast of tone on this foreground figure.|$|E
5|$|As the {{campaign}} unfolded, Krueger was pressured by MacArthur to capture Manila. He sent messages reporting {{what he saw}} {{was a lack of}} drive among the troops, and even moved his theater headquarters <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> Krueger's. MacArthur tried to exploit Krueger's rivalry with Eichelberger by allowing the latter's Eighth Army to conduct its own drive on Manila from the south. Krueger eventually sent a flying column from the 1st Cavalry Division, but MacArthur's expectation that the Japanese would not defend Manila was proven incorrect. Weeks of ferocious fighting were required to capture the city.|$|E

5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the funnels to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both funnels under certain circumstances.|$|E

Wasps possess mandibles adapted for biting and cutting, like those of many other insects, such as grasshoppers, but their other mouthparts are formed into a suctorial proboscis, which enables them to drink nectar.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} season García recorded a record-breaking tally of 16 {{goals for the}} season, the most ever in a single season by a Real Sociedad player. Her seasonal haul included a notable goal against rivals Athletic and a hat-trick against Levante during December which propelled Txuri-urdin to a fifth-placed finish in the Primera División, the club's highest placing since formation in 2004. Real Sociedad also made the quarter-finals of the Copa de la Reina where they were eliminated 5–1 by eventual runners-up Barcelona, with García netting the only goal of the match for her club.

5|$|Kesselring's {{forces in}} Italy {{retained}} their formidable defensive {{positions in the}} northern Apennines in March 1945. The 6th Division rejoined the line in early April, shortly before the Allies launched their spring 1945 offensive, Operation Grapeshot. The units including Rhodesians took up positions opposite Monte Sole, Monte Abelle and Monte Caprara. The Rhodesian 25-pounder guns were posted slightly <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> their former positions, and B(Rhodesia) Squadron, Prince Alfred's Guard, moved to Grizzana. The Special Service Battalion provided armoured support to the 13th South African Motorised Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Meanwhile, on Hill 677 the Canadians {{had spent}} the night of 23/24 April in their pits {{listening}} to the sounds of the fighting on the Australian front. However, by early morning Chinese activity increased and, with the situation deteriorating on the Patricia's right flank, Stone withdrew B Company from their position <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the feature's summit to strengthen this flank if the Australians were forced to withdraw. Under the command of Major Vince Lilley the company subsequently moved to occupy positions east of Battalion Headquarters on the high ground overlooking the valley road.|$|E
5|$|On 17 November, {{fighting}} for the main position around Sattelberg commenced. The previous night, in order {{to prepare for the}} attack on the 2200 feature, the 2/48th Battalion captured Green Ridge, a small but important feature that dominated the Sattelberg road. The capture of the ridge secured a start line <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> Jivevaneng for Whitehead's 26th Brigade to launch the first stage of their attack upon Sattelberg. The following day, the 2/48th Battalion handed over responsibility for the defence of the ridge to a company from the 2/23rd Battalion, and the attack commenced amidst heavy supporting artillery and machine-gun fire. In response, the Japanese artillery from Sattelberg fired a limited barrage onto the Australians on Green Ridge.|$|E

5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the forecastle deck abreast 'B' turret. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, {{one or both of the}} ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E

5|$|The P.1127 lacked any in-built armaments, {{the ethos}} of {{tactical}} flexibility meant a reliance upon underwing hard point-mounted munitions and equipment, which included multiple 2-inch rocket batteries, 30-mm ADEN cannon gun pods, and 1,000 lb bombs, napalm, and range-extending drop tanks. The prototypes were furnished with long nose-mounted instrumentation booms, these were replaced on the Kestrel with a much smaller counterpart on the vertical stabilizer to enable the nose to accommodate a tactical camera instead. An unusual feature of the P.1127 was the installation of a ram air turbine upon the rear fuselage just <b>forward</b> <b>of</b> the vertical stabilizer to provide power for ancillary services {{in the event of}} engine failure.|$|E
