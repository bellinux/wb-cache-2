Neil McKenzie produced a gritty 40 before being bowled round his legs by Monty Panesar. AB de Villiers scored freely before being very well caught by James Anderson off the bowling of Monty Panesar, and Ashwell Prince compiled a determined century to give the South African innings some resemblance of respectability.|$|E
25|$|Originally Edwin {{planned to}} launch five stores in key cities like London, but {{although}} they signed an initial deal on 4 June 1990 that was ratified that October, Edwin did not {{gain control of}} the Fiorucci assets until May 1992. In fact they would later lose the rights to the Fiorucci name in Canada on the grounds of disuse. However, one of Edwin's first acts was a deal with Coles Myer that would see 68 Fiorucci concessions in stores across Australia. They opened a new store in Piazza San Babila, Milan in early 1993, that included a variety of branded boutiques. It took them longer to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> going in North America, after a 1993 deal with Mary Ann Wheaton of Wheaton International fell through. In 1995 they licensed the rights for eyewear in the US to Swan International Optical, and then opened a US office in September 1997. However, the strategy of their licensee, Stephen Budd, to sell the brand into US department stores didn't work out so in 1999 they announced a plan to open a New York store once again. The initial plan was to open in time for Christmas 1999, but the store on lower Broadway finally opened its doors in June 2001. Commentators such as Kim Hastreiter were sceptical that it could recapture the buzz of times past, given the increased competition in mass-market clubbing gear from the likes of H and The Limited.|$|E

500|$|With Poquita Ropa, Arjona {{wanted to}} {{drastically}} change his musical style.

Arjona said about the album, [...] "music and women look better with little clothes", and that [...] "they [...] are like women; they <b>get</b> <b>things</b> up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty. The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves, because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them." ...|$|E
500|$|Gabriel {{later said}} he wrote all his lyrical {{contributions}} to the album in two days. Having rehearsed and written enough material for an album, the group entered Island Studios in August 1973. As with Foxtrot, John Burns helped with production. Burns' technical skills resulted in a good recorded sound and environment, and this motivated the group to play better and tackle more complex arrangements. Banks recalled the sessions being difficult, adding [...] "it was hard to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> going". Charisma released a live album, Genesis Live, compiled from concerts taped for the radio, {{to fill the gap}} between studio releases.|$|E

Arjona talking about the album, stated that [...] "music and women look better with little clothes", and that [...] "they [...] are like women; they <b>get</b> <b>things</b> up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty.

500|$|Holst {{was given}} a {{spectacular}} send-off. The conductor Adrian Boult recalled, [...] "Just before the Armistice, Gustav Holst burst into my office: 'Adrian, the YMCA are sending me to Salonica quite soon and Balfour Gardiner, bless his heart, {{has given me a}} parting present consisting of the Queen's Hall, full of the Queen's Hall Orchestra for the whole of a Sunday morning. So we're going to do The Planets, and you've got to conduct'." [...] There was a burst of activity to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> ready in time. The girls at St Paul's helped to copy out the orchestral parts, and the women of Morley and the St Paul's girls learned the choral part in the last movement.|$|E
500|$|Conversely, Tim Robey of The Daily Telegraph said, [...] "It feels entirely made by committee—the {{definition}} of house style, without a personal stamp in sight." [...] Leslie Felperin of The Hollywood Reporter said, [...] "Although director Alan Taylor manages to <b>get</b> <b>things</b> going properly {{for the final}} battle in London, the long stretches before that on Asgard and the other branches of Yggdrasil are a drag, like filler episodes of Game of Thrones but without the narrative complexity, mythical heft or all-pervading sexiness." [...] Michael Phillips of the Los Angeles Times described Thor: The Dark World as having the [...] "same old threats of galaxy annihilation spiced with fairly entertaining fish-out-of-water jokes". Jeannette Catsoulis of The New York Times said, [...] "the battle scenes are as lacking in heat and coherence as the central love story".|$|E

500|$|In 2010, Arjona {{wanted to}} change his musical style; after experimenting with using as few {{instruments}} as possible, he obtained a sound similar to an a capella performance (simplifying his sound) and introduced {{what he called a}} [...] "stripped-down acoustic effort" [...] to his music. This was heard on his twelfth studio album, Poquita Ropa. Arjona produced the album with Dan Warner, who has worked with Shakira, Celine Dion and Christina Aguilera. When promoting the album Arjona said, [...] " [...] are like women; they <b>get</b> <b>things</b> up and are so concerned about this that they forget that the less clothes, more beauty. The songs are often overwhelmed by ourselves, because we saturate them with arrangements looking to exalt their qualities and we end up hiding them". Poquita Ropa became the first album since Adentro which Arjona recorded without Torres.|$|E
500|$|Mellor's {{extensive}} scholarly {{art education}} {{has led to}} his art having a strong theoretical base. In interviews he has acknowledged the influence of diverse artists, including Indigenous painter Rover Thomas, Australian Sulman Prize winner Tim Storrier, Romantic painters including Germany's Caspar David Friedrich, and contemporary German artists Joseph Beuys, and Beuys' student Anselm Kiefer. He has harnessed {{a wide range of}} media during his career, including printmaking, drawing, painting and sculpture utilising wood, glass, steel and ceramics, as well as a range of more unorthodox materials, as his 2007 Indigenous Art Triennial entry demonstrated. Reflecting on that sculpture, Artlink Magazines reviewer, Daniel Thomas, remarked on how the work signified [...] "how colonisers always <b>get</b> <b>things</b> wrong; how Europeans looking for China, and its fine porcelain manufactures, stumbled instead upon the land of the kangaroo, and traded and planted ideas of racial and cultural superiority".|$|E

He wrote that Akhaten [...] "felt like a fully formed world" [...] but criticised the {{resolution}} and the Mummy's appearance. Gavin Fuller of The Daily Telegraph gave the episode {{three and a half}} out of five stars and called it [...] "a mixed bag ... but still with enough elements of uniqueness to demonstrate, almost 50 years on, just why there is still nothing like Doctor Who on television". He wrote that the religion and singing was well-realised, but felt the [...] "mind parasite" [...] was too similar to the Great Intelligence which was featured the previous week, and also thought the many aliens [...] "gave more than a hint of trying too hard and did not <b>get</b> <b>things</b> off to the best of starts". Digital Spy reviewer Morgan Jeffery praised Clara and the monsters, but felt that after a good build-up the episode fell apart at its climax, which he felt was [...] "far too fantastical".|$|E
