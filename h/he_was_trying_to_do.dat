5|$|This led Pausch {{to conduct}} a virtual reality class at Carnegie Mellon, to teach others {{and to help them}} realize their {{childhood}} dreams. In the course, 50 students from the university were separated into random teams of four and were each assigned a project relating to building a virtual world. Each group had two weeks to work on the project, and then presented the project to the group. The teams were then randomized again and a new project began. The project then evolved into something that people came to watch, and helped his students realize their potential. Finally, Pausch gave a few words of advice on how others could achieve their childhood dreams, and who his role models were when <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so.|$|E
25|$|During Kingdom Hearts II, Axel {{is ordered}} by the Organization to capture Roxas or kill him if he refuses to comply. Roxas refuses to return with Axel and defeats him before merging with Sora. Axel later begins acting {{on his own and}} kidnaps Kairi, but Saïx takes her under Xemnas's orders. Axel later finds Sora in a pathway to the World That Never Was and chooses to fight the Nobodies with him. Outnumbered, Axel {{performs}} a suicide attack to save Sora, and using the last of his strength to open the entrance to the World That Never Was. When asked what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> Axel admits he wanted to see Roxas.|$|E
25|$|On 4 February Lark {{was still}} in company with the two guarda costas when they {{encountered}} two gunboats and an armed schooner escorting a Spanish convoy of several small market boats. Lark was able to drive the vessels of the convoy ashore, but the escorts took refuge under the guns of a 4-gun battery in a creek in Bahia Cispata, Colombia. Lark silenced the battery. Nicholas then took his entire crew, less the 20 men he left to guard the two guarda costas, {{and put them in}} boats with the aim of capturing the gunboats and the armed schooner. The Spanish gunboats rowed towards the British boats but then retreated as the British drew nearer. Nicholas and three of his men then were wounded while they were capturing the rearmost vessel, a gun boat with one 24-pounder and two 6-pounder guns. Later, Lark had three more men wounded in the continuing action. Nicholas then attempted to pursue the remaining Spanish vessels up a creek but while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so, the pilot ran Postillon and Carmen ashore. This forced Nicholas to order their prize crews to burn them, which they did. Postillion blew up and Carmen was solidly aflame when the British last saw her.|$|E

25|$|Šarūnas {{started going}} to school in Jonas Jablonskis Middle School in 1982 and {{attended}} it till 1987. He {{had to take the}} bus to go to school even though the thermometer outside read minus twenty and he knew {{that the most important thing}} for his parents was that he spent as little time as possible with the toughest people of Partizanai Street. From 1987 to 1993, he was studying at Kaunas 4th Middle School. His first trip destination was Moscow, which he visited before the tournament. Jasikevičius's greatest youth memory in the city was the opening of the first McDonald's in Russia. He remembers that his classmates were listening with their mouths gaping when he was narrating about the French fries, bread rolls with minced beef and fizzy drinks. One of his childhood passions was history, especially about the Native Americans, as well as books about basketball as he was capable of reading a book of more than four hundred pages on basketball in two days. He was also curious about politics, especially when Perestroika began, because of which he was able to travel to Berlin with his father and brother, and was amazed by the visit to the Checkpoint Charlie Museum. His childhood favorite Lithuanian player was Arvydas Sabonis, which he admired more than other Lithuanian superstars, such as Rimas Kurtinaitis and Valdemaras Chomičius, due to his passing. However, his idol was Dražen Petrović, and he wished to be as good as him, watching matches of him over and over again, dozens of times, for hours and hours, and later started imitating him in workouts. After one of his trips, his dad came back with a videocassette recorder, using which he was able to record an NBA All-Star Game with Michael Jordan, Clyde Drexler, Larry Bird, Magic Johnson, David Robinson, and later to watch it for couple of years, more than hundred times. Jasikevičius also started to record games of Žalgiris and Petrović every time he was able to. Thanks to the video recorder, he discovered the existence of a no-look pass of Magic Johnson. For him, he was the NBA, not Michael Jordan. His unselfishness, imagination and the way he dribbled, passed between his opponent's legs bewitched Jasikevičius. Consequently, his favorite element of basketball quickly became assisting his teammates, and <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it like Petrović or Johnson.|$|E
2500|$|In {{an account}} {{recorded}} by Athenaeus, Timocreon {{ended up at}} the court of the Persian king where he distinguished himself as an athlete and glutton, eating so much that the king himself asked him what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> to which Timocreon replied that he was getting ready to beat up countless Persians. He made good his promise the next day and, after overwhelming all the Persians who were game enough to fight him, he commenced punching the air, just to show that [...] "he had all those blows left if anyone wanted to take him on." [...] However, the boorishness and gluttony of athletes was a topos of Greek comedy and even a hero like Hercules was the butt of many jokes.|$|E
2500|$|During {{a game in}} 1982, Frank Layden, {{then head}} coach of the Utah Jazz, had seen enough of his team's poor {{performance}} and wanted an early exit. Layden verbally abused Strom so he could get ejected from the game. Strom knew what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and when Layden asked why he didn't eject him, Strom replied, [...] "I know what you're trying to do, Frank, but if I've got to stay out here and watch this shit, so do you". After Game 4 of the 1987 NBA Finals between the Los Angeles Lakers and Boston Celtics, Red Auerbach confronted Strom in the hallway near the locker rooms and told Strom, [...] "That was the worst officiated game I ever saw!", referring {{to the fact that the}} Lakers shot 14 free throws in the fourth quarter to the Celtics' 1. Strom stared back at Auerbach and said, [...] "Arnold, you're showing all the class I knew you always had." ...|$|E

2500|$|Gabrion's {{neighbors were}} also interviewed by police. They {{reported}} that Gabrion had a handyman named John Weeks, {{but that he}} hadn't been seen around the property in a few weeks. Investigators contacted Weeks' girlfriend, who identified a photo of Gabrion as a man introduced to her as [...] "Lance". She reported that Lance had left the area with Weeks and she hadn't heard from him and was unsure {{of how to get}} a hold of him. She also reported to police that on one occasion she caught John on the phone with a girl named Rachel. When she confronted him, she was told that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> a favor for Lance, who was interested in being set up with her. Authorities believe that Weeks was the mystery date who picked up Rachel and Shannon on the day they were last seen and that he arranged the date at the behest of Gabrion.|$|E

60|$|Armand {{took it from}} him, and {{sat down}} close to the table; leaning forward he held the paper near the light, and began to read. He read the letter through very slowly to the end, then once again from the beginning. <b>He</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> that which Chauvelin had wished to do an hour ago; {{he was trying to}} find the inner meaning which he felt must inevitably lie behind these words which Percy had written with his own hand.|$|E

"Rounders {{certainly}} did overwork himself, {{and this was}} in the line of trying to make us believe that he thoroughly liked this plan of ours of living in a cot by a rill, and that he was quite capable of forgetting his ordinary life of affluence and luxury in the simple joys of our rural household. He would have produced an impression on both Anita and me if he had not said so much about it; but I knew what <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and made all the necessary allowances for him.|$|E

That wasn't the thought <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> lay hold of. What <b>was</b> it <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> think? Suicide wicked-- God, how this cough hurt him. What was it-- Suicide? No! He violently pushed away {{the thought of}} suicide and its wickedness, and at last shouted, within himself: [...] "Oh, that's what I was thinking!

60|$|But {{what could}} he do? At Bithoor, {{in the power of}} this treacherous Rajah, secure in the zenana, where no man save its master ever penetrated, how could he {{possibly}} help her? Yet the thought that <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> so was a happy one, and the tears that flowed between her closed lids were not painful ones. She blamed herself now for having felt for a moment hurt at Bathurst's desertion of her. To have remained in the boat would have been certain death, while he could have been of no assistance to her or anyone else. That he should escape, then, if he could, now seemed to her a perfectly natural action; she hoped that some of the others had done the same, and that Bathurst was not working alone.|$|E
60|$|The young {{actor who}} thought he saw his part in Maxwell's play had so far made his way upward on the Pacific Coast that he felt {{justified}} in taking the road {{with a combination of}} his own. He met the author at a dinner of the Papyrus Club in Boston, where they were introduced with a facile flourish of praise from the journalist who brought them together, as the very men who were looking for each other, and who {{ought to be able to}} give the American public a real American drama. The actor, who believed he had an ideal of this drama, professed an immediate interest in the kind of thing Maxwell told him <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> and asked him to come the next day, if he did not mind its being Sunday, and talk the play over with him.|$|E

You cannot move the right foot along dotted line A B and bring the left foot round curve C D in a paying-cashier's cage in a bank, nor, if you are at all sensitive to public opinion, on the pavement going home. And while <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> it in the parlour of the flat one night when he imagined that Minnie was in the kitchen cooking supper, she came in unexpectedly to ask how he wanted the steak cooked.

60|$|Blake agreed. He {{felt that}} he ought to have sailed earlier, but the temptation to remain was strong. He now met Millicent every day, and it might be a very long time before he {{returned}} to England. He feared that he was laying up trouble for himself, but he recklessly determined {{to make the most of}} the present, and, in spite of his misgivings, the next eight or nine days brought him many delightful hours. Now she knew he was going, Millicent abandoned the reserve she had sometimes shown. She was sympathetic, interested in his plans, and, he thought, wonderfully charming. They were rapidly drawn closer together, and the more he learned of her character, the stronger his admiration grew. At times he imagined he noticed a tender shyness in her manner, and though it delighted him he afterwards took himself to task. He was not acting honourably; he had no right to win this girl's love, as <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do,</b> but there was the excuse that she knew his history and it had not made her cold to him.|$|E
6000|$|She whispered, as if frightened {{she might}} be overheard: [...] "I don't want him to see me like this." [...] It {{was one of the}} pathetic things about her that she seemed at times to have some vague {{understanding}} of her condition, and then she would sob. Her tears were anguish to him, but it was at those times that she clung to him as if she knew <b>he</b> <b>was</b> <b>trying</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> something for her, and that encouraged him to go on. He went over, step by step, the time when she lived alone in the doctor's house, the time of his own coming back, her love for him and his treatment of her, the story of the garnet ring, her coming to Switzerland, her terrible walk, her return; he would miss out nothing, for he was fighting for her. Day after day, month by month, it went on, and to-morrow, perhaps, she would insist that the old doctor and this man who asked her so many questions were one. And Tommy argued with her until he had driven that notion out, to make way for another, and then he fought it, and so on and on all round the circle of her delusions, day by day and month by month.|$|E
