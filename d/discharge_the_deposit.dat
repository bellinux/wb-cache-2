40|$|An {{original}} {{method for}} estimating fouled deposit thickness {{on the inside}} surfaces of natural gas cooler tubes is presented. This method does not require opening and inspecting a cooler as {{it is based on}} the measurement of gas cooling degree, i. e. the gas temperature difference between the cooler inlet and <b>discharge.</b> <b>The</b> <b>deposit</b> layer on the internal heat transfer surfaces is of semi-liquid consistency and its thermal conductivity coefficient has not been investigated until now. This paper describes the experimental determination of the deposit thermal conductivity coefficient. This parameter enables determination of a cooler’s performance as a function of current deposit thickness. Practical application of the method is illustrated in the case of CH_R cooler working in the KS 01 compressor station in Vel’ké Kapušany, Slovakia. For this type of cooler, a diagram for deposit thickness as a function of the gas cooling degree is presented. Web of Science 25112941293...|$|E

40|$|The {{carbonate}} encrusting {{process and}} its consequent products (crusts, tufa and travertine) {{in the southern}} Morocco (Ouarzazate) are studied in this thesis. A detailed inventory of <b>the</b> carbonate <b>deposits</b> is given. <b>The</b> dynamic aspects of carbonate precipitation and dissolution are considered from an environmental point of view. The main factors influencing their genesis are discussed {{on the basis of}} a multidisciplinary investigation. Among the accumulated carbonates, caliches are the most abundant. Their genesis invokes a changing environment where sedimentation has the same importance as the biogenic and pedogenic processes. Dated by the Uranium/Thorium method, these caliches are older than 300 ka. They indicate that the encrusting process is ancient. These deposits have become progressively rare during the Quaternary period except for the important hydrothermal travertine of Skoura. Only a few accumulations are still forming nowadays (Ait Arbi and Ifesfas). Their absence in present day water, especially in rivers is interpreted as indicating an environmental change. It is hypothesised that a desequilibrium affects the incrusting process. A comparative study between rivers and sources in different settings is carried out. The saturation degree of water, its chemical composition, especially in elements that may have particular origins (potassium, nitrate, sulfate, etc.) and its bacteriological characteristics are investigated in the thesis. Results seem to indicate that differences exist between the calcite - precipitating waters of some sources (not affected by human activities) and the sterile waters of rivers (Dades and M'goun). The latter are polluted by chemical fertilizers or turbulent, such that no carbonate <b>deposits</b> are permitted. <b>The</b> conclusion is that the reduced incrusting phenomena indicate an environmental change.

These results agree with the hypothesis that calcite and pyrite were deposited by mediation of microbial activity, caused by the coupled reactions of vent methane oxidation and marine sulphate reduction, and suggest that biomineralization prevails over abiotic precipitation processes in such coastal gasohydrothermal vents.

40|$|We {{describe}} {{the products of the}} hitherto poorly known 512 AD eruption at Vesuvius, Italy. <b>The</b> <b>deposit</b> records a complex sequence of eruptive events, and it has been subdivided into eight main units, composed of stratified scoria lapilli or thin subordinate ash-rich layers. All the units formed by deposition from tephra fallout, pyroclastic density currents of limited extent being restricted to the initial stages of the eruption (U 2). The main part of <b>the</b> <b>deposit</b> (U 3 and U 5) is characterized by a striking grain size alternation of fine to coarse lapilli, similar to that often described for mid-intensity, explosive eruptions. The erupted products have a phonotephritic composition, with progressively less evolved composition from the base {{to the top of the}} stratigraphic sequence. Based on different dispersal, sedimentological and textural features of the products, we identify five phases related to different eruptive styles: opening phase (U 1, U 2), subplinian phase (U 3 to U 5), pulsatory phreatomagmatic phase (U 6), violent strombolian phase (U 7) and final ash-dominated phase (U 8). A DRE volume of 0. 025 km 3 has been calculated for <b>the</b> total fallout <b>deposit.</b> Most of <b>the</b> magma was erupted during the subplinian phase; lithic dispersal data indicate peak column heights of between 10 and 15 km, which correspond to a mass discharge rate (MDR) of 5 × 106 kg s− 1. The lower intensity, violent strombolian phase coincided with the eruption of the least evolved magma; a peak column height of 6 – 9 km, corresponding to an MDR of 1 × 106 kg s− 1, is estimated from field data. Phreatomagmatic activity played a minor role in the eruption, only contributing to <b>the</b> ash-rich <b>deposits</b> of U 1, U 4, U 6 and U 8.

The inbalance between the rates of magma supply and magma eruption may have caused the frequent changes in the eruptive style. Conversely, the high frequency oscillations of magma <b>discharge</b> recorded by <b>the</b> <b>deposits</b> of <b>the</b> subplinian phase were possibly related to cyclic instabilities in the permeability of the low viscosity magma column, which modulated magma fragmentation and discharge...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe re-deposition of {{constructional}} materials {{inside the}} chamber of a fusion device is undesirable mainly for increased capture of hydrogen isotopes in <b>the</b> <b>deposited</b> layers. Currently, {{a variety of methods}} for wall cleaning from <b>the</b> <b>deposited</b> layers are developed, including a special “cleaning” <b>discharge</b> inside <b>the</b> chamber with an oxygen puff. Special attention is paid to film removal in gaps and regions shaded from the plasma. The study of CH-films deposition and their removal in gaps and regions shaded from the plasma were conducted in the linear simulator with a beam-plasma discharge PR- 2 in a mode with automatic generation of high-frequency current oscillations, which ensured the presence of RF fields. High efficiency of cleaning the films in gaps is demonstrated in <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> in oxygen with the presence of RF fields. The film cleaning rate was up to 1. 7 μm for 2 hours...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Carbon nitride (CNx) {{films were}} {{fabricated}} by plasma enhanced {{chemical vapor deposition}} technology in methane-ammonia system, in which the plasma was excited by the hollow cathode glow <b>discharge.</b> <b>The</b> composition，microstructure and hardness of <b>the</b> <b>deposited</b> films were investigated by measurements employing X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and nano-indentation experiment. The {{results indicate that the}} nitrogen content in the film varies from 4. 2 to 8. 6 at. % and the nitrogen atoms are bonded to carbon atoms through C-N, C=N and C≡N bonds. Furthmore, higher nitrogen content is in favor of the formation of C-N bond, which may enhance the film hardness...|$|R
40|$|Using d. c. {{reactive}} sputtering of a molybdenum target, we have studied <b>the</b> effect of <b>discharge</b> power, substrate temperature and nitrogen pressure on molybdenum nitride formation. The crystallographic {{structure and composition}} of <b>the</b> <b>deposited</b> Mo-N film surfaces were investigated by reflection {{high energy electron diffraction}} and Auger electron spectroscopy. It was found that <b>the</b> <b>deposits</b> consist of <b>the</b> cubic Mo 2 N 1 ±x(f. c. c.), the tetragonal β-Mo 2 N and the hexagonal δ-MoN phases. By controlling the substrate temperature and the deposition rate, which is strongly dependent on <b>the</b> <b>discharge</b> power, during <b>the</b> {{reactive sputtering}}, the stability domains of different phases were established and it has been possible to produce the f. c. c. nitride with a composition near 48. 5 at. % N. © 1992.

40|$|The paper {{presents}} {{the investigation of}} iron-containing deposits at water treatment in the Tomsk water supply intake. The chemical composition of the waters facilitates <b>the</b> formation of <b>deposits</b> in a large amount on {{the territory of the}} Tom lower course. A large ground water deposit is located here, and it is used for Tomsk water supply. Currently, <b>the</b> <b>deposit</b> obtained at water treatment is <b>discharged</b> in <b>the</b> Kislovka, and this practice causes a serious environmental problem. <b>The</b> ways of <b>deposit</b> usage are offered in the paper, which will sufficiently increase environmental protection measures on the territory of the Tom lower course...|$|R
