5|$|I hemmed and hawed {{about it}} for a while because just for that reason though. Everybody wants to do the theme song of a James Bond movie, and I never liked to do what {{everybody}} else likes to do. It's just some perverse thing in me, right? So, but then <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> and I said, you know what? James Bond needs to get – needs to get techno so...|$|E
500|$|While {{the group}} were {{considering}} {{a replacement for}} Bayley, Rod Smallwood convinced Steve Harris to invite Bruce Dickinson back into the band. Although Harris admits that he [...] "wasn't really into it" [...] at first, he then thought, [...] "'Well, if the change happens, who should we get?' The thing is, we know Bruce {{and we know what}} he's capable of, and you think, 'Well, better the devil you know.' I mean, we got on well professionally for, like, eleven years, and so... after <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I didn't really have a problem with it." ...|$|E
500|$|Wirkola said, [...] "I have {{a strong}} memory from my {{childhood}} of just how dark and gruesome their tale was and I wondered {{what would have happened}} to the two of them when they grew up? They had this dark past and this intense hatred of witches. So as <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> it made sense to me that of course they would be fated to become great witch hunters. We wanted it to feel like this could be happening 300 years ago but at the same time, there is a modern spin on all the action, characters and weaponry. It was a fun way to make a classical world feel fresh." [...] Wirkola said that he originally came with that idea in 2007 while studying film and television at Bond University in Australia, when he wanted to make it as just a short film, and that the film school director Simon Hunter advised him: [...] "Tom, don't ever speak of the idea again until you are in front of a Hollywood producer and I guarantee you will sell it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On February 18, Williams {{announced}} via Twitter {{that his}} second album, Girl {{would be released}} on March 3, 2014. At the 86th Academy Awards on March 2, 2014, Williams's song [...] "Happy" [...] lost to [...] "Let It Go" [...] from Frozen. [...] Afterwards, when GQ magazine asked Williams [...] "how badly" [...] did he want the Oscar, he responded: [...] "When they read the results, my face was...frozen.

2500|$|... "As I {{read the}} utopian socialists, the {{scientific}} socialists, the German Social Democrats and revolutionary socialists—whatever I could in either English or French—I {{came to the}} conclusion that almost all of them, including my grandfather, were engaged in an effort to change human nature. The more <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> the more I thought this was not likely to be a successful effort. So I turned my attention more and more to political philosophy and less and less to socialist activism of any kind." ...|$|E

2500|$|Newsted {{has stated}} {{that he has never}} regretted leaving the band. In a 2009 interview, he said [...] "I tell you very honestly, one billion percent, I have never regretted leaving Metallica. It was the right thing for everyone. It {{was the right thing to}} do for the camp. That's it. I've never told anyone that I wanted to go back or {{anything}} like that—not once. I made up my mind. It was not an easy thing to do, but it was something I had to do. <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> very much before I pulled the trigger and because of that, I have never looked back. The past is where it's supposed to be." [...] It was mentioned in the film Some Kind of Monster that there was a rumor that Newsted would possibly rejoin the band, but it was proven false.|$|E
2500|$|The Bulldogs {{left the}} WWF in 1988, {{in part due}} to {{backstage}} problems between the Bulldogs, specifically the Dynamite Kid, and the Rougeau Brothers over a prank pulled by Curt Hennig. The Bulldogs, noted ribbers (pranksters) in their own right, were blamed for the prank, leading to a series of confrontations that culminated in Jacques Rougeau knocking out four of the Dynamite Kid's teeth with a fist filled with a roll of quarters. Though there are various accounts of this situation, many suggest that Billington drew first blood by bullying Rougeau (among many others including The Honky Tonk Man, whom Dynamite, allegedly, brought to tears) in Miami. While Rougeau was playing cards backstage, from behind, Billington smacked Jacques in the ear and then punched and kicked him in the face several times and also struck Raymond, who was on crutches at the time. It was weeks before Jacques responded. Bret Hart wrote about the incident, in his book HITMAN: My Real Life in the Cartoon World of Wrestling: [...] "At first I was upset, and contemplated getting involved. But the more <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> the more I realized that Tom had been asking for this for years and that everyone who'd been bullied by him would rejoice at the news." [...] After no disciplinary action was taken against Jacques, Billington quit the WWF, and Smith followed suit.|$|E
2500|$|He aroused much {{controversy}} by his {{series of three}} pictures: firstly, of a Roman execution (the Crucifixion by the Romans (1887)); secondly, [...] "Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English" [...] depicting sepoys being blown from cannons; and, thirdly, of the execution of Nihilists in St Petersburg. His picture Suppression of the Indian Revolt by the English depicted executions carried out by tying victims to the barrels of guns. Vereshchagin's detractors argued that such executions had only occurred in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, but the painting depicted modern soldiers of the 1880s, implying that the practice was then current. Because of its photographic style, the painting appeared to present itself as an impartial record of a real event. In the Magazine of Art in December 1887, Vereshchagin defended himself by saying {{that if there were}} another rebellion then the British would use this method again.By the late 19th century, Vereshchagin had gained popularity, not only in Russia, but also abroad and his name never left the pages of the European and American press. From his earliest works, unlike most contemporary battle pieces depicting war as a kind of parade, Vereshchagin graphically depicted the horrors of war. [...] "I loved the sun all my life, and wanted to paint sunshine. When I happened to see warfare and say what <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it,</b> I rejoiced that I would be able to devote myself to the sun once again. But the fury of war continued to pursue me," [...] Vereshchagin wrote. One day, in 1882, Vereshchagin’s exhibition in Berlin was visited by German Field Marshal Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. Vereshchagin brought Moltke to his painting The Apotheosis of War. The picture evoked a sort of confusion in the Field Marshal. After his visit to the exhibition, Moltke issued an order forbidding German soldiers to visit it. The Austrian war minister did the same. He also declined the artist's offer to let Austrian officers see his pictures free of charge at the 1881 exhibition in Vienna.|$|E

2500|$|Coonan's casting as Carl was {{announced}} on 6 May 2013, {{when it was}} revealed that the character is Kirsty Branning's (Kierston Wareing) ex-boyfriend and has been in prison, where he had shared a cell with Derek Branning (Jamie Foreman). Coonan said of his casting, [...] "EastEnders {{has been a part of}} my life since I was 12 years old. I even remember talking about the storylines in school playgrounds in Tottenham and I am very happy and proud to now be a small part of its life." [...] Executive producer Lorraine Newman said: [...] "It's wonderful to have Daniel Coonan joining us in Walford to play Carl White. Oozing confidence and with a dangerous edge, will Kirsty be able to resist his bad boy charms for long, or can [...] Max [...] save her from the lure of the dark side?" [...] This is Coonan's second role in EastEnders, as he played David Priors in 2011. Coonan said the four-episode role helped him prepare for a bigger role in the programme, though describing his first day on set as Carl, he said, [...] "it still hits you when you walk on to the Square for the very first time. It's like walking into your TV." [...] Coonan filmed his first scene on the Bridge Street market set. Heat reported that Carl's introduction was part of a [...] "rescue plan" [...] to increase ratings for EastEnders, especially with the announced departures of popular characters Tanya Branning (Jo Joyner), Jack Branning (Scott Maslen) and Michael Moon (Steve John Shepherd), saying [...] "with ever-dwindling ratings and an unusually bare trophy cabinet, producers have been forced to plan some major shake-ups in an attempt to revive the ailing drama with new characters, returning familiar faces and exciting storylines." [...] Coonan later said of being cast, [...] "When they offered the part of Carl to me, <b>I</b> <b>thought</b> <b>about</b> <b>it</b> as long as it takes to blink your eyelids. I knew it would be a great character and fun to play. Something like this can massively raise your profile. I'm beaming into thousands of people's homes four times a week." [...] Coonan was originally contracted to appear in 28 episodes over a six-month period, but instead filmed over 60 episodes. After Danny Dyer was cast as Mick Carter in the show, he revealed that he was approached to play Carl.|$|E
