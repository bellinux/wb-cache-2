5|$|Inside the elevator, Henry asks Archie why {{he refuses}} {{to believe that he}} is Jiminy Cricket. Archie {{acknowledges}} that he might share Jiminy's personality and in a similar fashion to his alternative past, yearn to be free from being told what to do. Meanwhile, above ground, Emma finds the opening of the elevator shaft and volunteers to go down the shaft, where she succeeds in rescuing Henry and Archie. Archie tells Regina that he will continue to see Henry and that if she attempts to interfere he will take action against Regina and have her declared an unfit mother. Regina backs down after Archie's threat, she looks at the object she <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> pocket and throws it down the shaft, where it lands on top of the rest of Snow White's (Ginnifer Goodwin) glass coffin.|$|E

The first single actually issued from this album was Alone in My Room, a download-only track released on 7 November 2005. 'Alone in My Room' was also the name given to Skin's first solo tour in two years, which commenced in Berlin in November 2005. For this album she shaved her head bald again, returning to the look she <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> Skunk Anansie days.|$|E
25|$|Sulley {{was born}} in Sheffield, UK on 22 March 1963. She was raised and spent all her early years in the Gleadless suburb of the city. For her final {{education}} she attended the city's Frecheville Comprehensive School from the late 1970s until mid 1981. Her best friend {{from the age of}} 13 was fellow lifelong Sheffield resident and Frecheville student Joanne Catherall. By early 1981 she was calling herself 'Susanne Sulley', a familiar amalgamation of her two first names, a nickname by which she had been casually known at school. In 1980 while still at school she had a part-time job in a Sheffield hairdressing salon and a casual summer job selling ice cream at a Sheffield cinema, the only jobs she has <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> life apart from music.|$|E

500|$|On July 1, police {{retrieved}} the items found in Murray's vehicle {{from her family}} for forensic analysis. [...] On July 13, a one-mile radius search was performed by nearly 100 searchers, including state troopers, rescue personnel, and volunteers. It was the fourth search around the crash area and the first search performed without snow on the ground. Authorities were most interested in locating the black backpack Murray <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> possession but not found in her car.

500|$|Much of Sullivan's {{legal work}} after {{independence}} was framed by republican ideals. [...] His republicanism was expressed in wide-ranging support for individual rights, {{including those of}} women, children, and minorities, and manifested in letters to contemporaries including John Adams, cases he argued as a lawyer, and decisions he made as a judge. [...] As attorney general he defended the state in a Loyalist recovery action involving the rights of married women (who at the time had few rights under the common law doctrine of coverture), arguing that Loyalist William Martin's wife <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own right abandoned the property in question.|$|E

She recalled the importance of a council funded youth worker she <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> school years and the use of tax money to incentivise a new business job creation program amongst the working class. She stated that the top forty companies in Britain who banked offshore should be made to pay taxes in the UK and [...] "cut the poor people some slack." ...|$|E
500|$|While Napoleon's mistresses had {{children}} by him, Joséphine {{did not produce}} an heir, possibly because of either the stresses of her imprisonment during the Reign of Terror or an abortion she may have <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> twenties.

And then I'll probably play up until the millennium, New Year's Eve." [...] The tour was delayed until 2001, as she <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> own words, [...] "been distracted by having children and filming movies". She also began a serious relationship with Guy Ritchie in 1999. By 2000, she had become pregnant with her son Rocco Ritchie, released her eighth studio album Music that year, and married Ritchie in December 2000.|$|E
500|$|On 25 May, Warne asked Potter to {{send him}} one of the two dummy books she <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> {{possession}} in order to check the size of the plates before continuing with the printer's blocks. He thought there was [...] "too much bend" [...] about the dog's nose and the division between its legs was unclear. He kept the two plates back for Potter's inspection before sending them off to make the blocks. On 26 May, he received two more originals and the circular portrait of the cat for the cover. He thought the background of the colour illustration of Ribby and Duchess sitting at the table too light, but liked the pen-and-ink sketches. Potter struggled with the dog illustrations, and sent Warne a photograph of her canine model to prove the dog's ruff was as large as she had depicted it.|$|E
500|$|By {{the end of}} the 1930s, Montalban {{was living}} on Grays Inn Road in the Borough of Holborn. In 1939, she married fireman George Edward North in London.

She later informed friends that during the Second World War, George had served in the Royal Navy while she served in the Women's Royal Naval Service (WRNS), although such claims have never been corroborated. Gerald Gardner, founder of Gardnerian Wicca – known for his unreliable stories – claimed that he met Montalban during the war, when she was wearing a WRNS uniform, and that at the time she was working as a [...] "personal clairvoyant and psychic advisor" [...] to Lord Louis Mountbatten.

500|$|Business negotiations, {{allegations}} of sexual impropriety, alcohol and non-prescription drug use were sources of tension between the Maharishi and the Beatles. Aspinall was surprised when he realised the Maharishi was a sophisticated negotiator, knowing {{more than the average}} person about financial percentages. [...] Evans told Saltzman that the Maharishi wanted the band to deposit up to 25% of their next album's profits in his Swiss bank account as a tithe, to which Lennon replied, [...] "Over my dead body". Mardas pointed to the luxury of the facility and the business acumen of the Maharishi and asked Lennon why the Maharishi always had an accountant by his side. Mardas said the Maharishi offered him money to build a high-powered radio station. Lennon later told his wife that he felt that the Maharishi <b>had,</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> words, [...] "too much interest in public recognition, celebrities and money" [...] for a spiritual man. According to her sister, Pattie Boyd had dreamt that [...] "the Maharishi wasn't what he seemed". Cynthia Lennon, Cooke de Herrera and authors such as Barry Miles have blamed Mardas for turning Lennon against the Maharishi but Mardas denied this. Meanwhile, the weather, which had been quite cool in February, was growing hot [...] and the Maharishi was planning to move the whole group to Kashmir, at a higher and cooler altitude in a week.|$|E
500|$|The Telegraphs Nigel Farndale {{praised the}} film's {{balanced}} {{view of the}} director: [...] "ven though he was portrayed in this exquisite drama as a manipulative, vindictive martinet, the portrait was not unsympathetic." [...] The Daily Mirrors Jane Simon echoed this view, praising Jones's Hitchcock and writing that the actor [...] "managed to give [...] touches of humanity, too. There are moments when you feel a real pang of sympathy for Hitchcock, although admittedly they don't last long". [...] "liding gracefully through it all (and with an impeccable American accent) Sienna Miller brings untouchable beauty and icy glamour, but also captures the extraordinary resilience Hedren must have had to withstand everything Hitchcock threw at her." [...] In The Telegraph, Clive James said [...] " [...] better choice [...] {{could not have been}} made than Sienna Miller, who is even lovelier than Hedren was...Toby Jones, quite believably looked stunned". John Doyle of Canada's The Globe and Mail was less impressed with the actors' performances. Of Miller (whom he described as [...] "good but not great") he wrote, [...] "She doesn't have the iciness that Hedren <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> youth and she struggles to convey Hedren's enormous strength of character as a woman unwilling to let Hitchcock have his way". Doyle was equally critical of Jones, describing him as someone who [...] "seems to be imitating Hitchcock rather than inhabiting the role".|$|E
500|$|The music video, {{directed}} by Shaun Silva, was filmed in Paris, London, and Murfreesboro, Tennessee. The Union Station hotel is featured as {{a train station}} in the video. Kelley explained that the director decided to shoot parts of the music video in Europe because he wanted the video to be [...] "as authentic as possible". The video begins with a young woman, Joy, played by actress Danielle Donn, entering a train and discovering an iPad in her backpack. The iPad has a video of her lover with a sign written in French words that mean [...] "Don't forget about me," [...] and also some videos of the couple's travels throughout London, Paris, and Berlin, after which the couple bid each other farewell. A subsequent scene shows Joy's boyfriend finding her sitting on a train seat and they share a kiss. Joy is then seen awoken from sleep as a man named Brady, who looks exactly like the boyfriend in Joy's dream, sits next to her. Brady apologizes for waking her and asks if she minds if he sits next to her. The two make introductions, and Joy mentions her dream. Brady then takes out his iPad case (exactly the same case as the one Joy <b>had</b> <b>in</b> <b>her</b> dream), and smiles at her. Joy smiles back, having experienced this deja vu moment. The group members are seen singing at a Tennessee train station, and on the train itself.|$|E
