40|$|Fluxes of CO₂ and H₂O vapour from dense {{stands of}} the C₄ {{emergent}} macrophyte grass Echinochloa polystachya were measured by eddy covariance {{in both the}} low water (LW) and <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>HW,</b> flooded) phases of the annual Amazon river cycle at Manaus, Brazil. Typical clear-sky midday CO₂ uptake rates by the vegetation stand (including detritus, sediment or water surface) were 30 and 35 μmol CO₂ (ground) m⁻² s⁻¹ in the LW and HW periods, respectively. A rectangular hyperbola model fitted the responses of "instantaneous" (20 - or 30 -min average) net CO₂ exchange rates to incident photosynthetic photon flux densities (PFD) well. Stand evaporation rates were linearly related to PFD. The major difference in CO₂ uptake rates between the two periods was the larger respiration flux during LW due to the CO₂ efflux from sediment, roots and litter. Integrated 20 - or 30 -min fluxes were used to derive relationships between daily CO₂ and H₂O vapour fluxes and incident radiation. The daily CO₂ fluxes were almost linearly related to incident radiation, but there was evidence of saturation at the highest daily radiation totals. Annual productivity estimated from the daily model in 1996 - 1997 agreed closely with that previously estimated for 1985 - 1986 from a leaf-scale photosynthetic model, but were some 15 % less than those derived at that time from biomass harvests. Both CO₂ uptake and water use efficiency were comparable with those found in fertilised maize fields in warm temperate conditions...|$|E

Surface sediments were collected in four hydrological seasons: low water (LW), rising water (RW), <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>HW)</b> and falling water (FW) in 2009 and 2010. We investigated commonly used bulk geochemical tracers such as the C : N ratio and the stable isotopic composition of organic carbon (δ 13 Corg). These results were compared with lignin-phenol parameters {{as an indicator of}} vascular plant detritus and branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs) to trace the input of soil organic matter (OM) from land to the aquatic settings. We also applied the isoprenoid GDGT (iGDGT) crenarchaeol as an indicator of riverine suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM). Our data showed that during the RW and FW seasons, the surface sediments were enriched in lignin and brGDGTs in comparison to other seasons. Our study also indicated that floodplain lake sediments primarily consisted of allochthonous, C 3 plant-derived OM. However, a downstream increase in C 4 macrophyte derived OM contribution was observed along the gradient of increasing open waters, i. e. from upstream to downstream. Accordingly, we attribute temporal and spatial difference in SOM composition to the hydrological dynamics between the floodplain lakes and the surrounding flooded forests. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|Heavy metal {{contamination}} and drought {{are expected to}} increase in large areas worldwide. However, their combined effect on plant performance has been scantly analyzed. This study examines the effect of Zn supply at different water availabilities on morpho-physiological traits of Quercus suber L. in order to analyze the combined effects of both stresses. Seedlings were treated with four levels of zinc from 3 to 150 µM and exposed to low <b>watering</b> (LW) or <b>high</b> <b>watering</b> (<b>HW)</b> frequency in hydroponic culture, using a growth chamber. Under both watering regimes, Zn concentration in leaves and roots increased with Zn increment in nutrient solution. Nevertheless, at the highest Zn doses, Zn tissue concentrations were almost twice in HW than in LW seedlings. Functional traits as leaf photosynthetic rate and root hydraulic conductivity, and morphological traits as root length and root biomass decreased significantly in response to Zn supply. Auxin levels increased with Zn concentrations, suggesting the involvement of this phytohormone in the seedling response to this element. LW seedlings exposed to 150 µM Zn showed higher root length and root biomass than HW seedlings exposed to the same Zn dose. Our results suggest that low water availability could mitigate Zn toxicity by limiting internal accumulation. Morphological traits involved in the response to both stresses probably contributed to this response.

Twenty-four samples were obtained using Surber sampler, and the hydraulic, physical and chemical characterization of the sampling sites was carried out.

No {{significant differences were found between}} the abiotic parameters of each site. A positive correlation of Sperchon, Torrentícola and Neoatractides was observed in relation to flow and current velocity whereas Hygrobates showed a negative correlation. No significant differences were observed in Hydrachnidia abundances among the sites in HW and LW and between the pairs of each site in HW and LW. The genera with the highest densities were Hygrobates, Limnesia and Atractides, of which the first two were widely distributed. The rest only appeared sporadically.

40|$|Objective: To {{determine}} {{the amount of}} triglyceride deposition from a lipid-containing artificial tear eye drop (Endura®) on three different types of contact lenses after one day and one month of simulated use. Methods: Simulated use of artificial tears was performed in vitro on three different types of contact lenses, including: <b>high</b> <b>water</b> content (<b>HW),</b> low <b>water</b> content (LW), and silicone hydrogel (SI) contact lenses. To simulate one day of use, contact lenses were incubated in artificial tear solution for 16 hours. To simulate a one month of use, they underwent repeated cycles of 16 -hour incubation in artificial tear solution, lens cleaning, and 8 -hour storage in a multipurpose solution daily for 30 days. Triglyceride deposited was extracted and determined. Results: After one day of simulated use, amount of deposited triglyceride was significantly different among 3 types of contact lenses with the highest deposition in SI followed by LW and HW contact lenses; the corresponding values (mean ± SD) were 3. 79 ± 0. 35, 0. 84 ± 0. 27, and 0. 26 ± 0. 17 μg/lens, respectively. Only between SI and HW was it found to be statistically different. After one month of simulated use, deposition on SI lenses was slightly increased (6. 56 ± 1. 10 μg/lens) with that on LW and HW lenses remaining low (0. 10 ± 0. 12 and 0. 55 ± 0. 34 μg/lens, respectively). Conclusion: Triglyceride from lipid-containing artificial tears can absorb into contact lenses, particularly those made of silicone hydrogel, most notably after long periods of use.

40|$|Suspended {{particulate}} matter (SPM) was collected along the Amazon River {{in the central}} Amazon basin and in three tributaries during the rising water (RW), <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>HW),</b> falling water (FW) and low water (LW) season. Changes in the concentration {{and the distribution of}} branched glycerol dialkyl glycerol tetraethers (brGDGTs), i. e., the methylation index of branched tetraethers (MBT) and the cyclization of brGDGTs (CBT), were seen in the Amazon main stem. The highest concentration of core lipid (CL) brGDGTs normalized to particulate organic carbon (POC) was found during the HW season. During the HW season the MBT and CBT in the Amazon main stem was also most similar to that of lowland Amazon (terra firme) soils, indicating that the highest input of soil-derived brGDGTs occurred due to increased water runoff. During the other seasons the MBT and CBT indicated an increased influence of in situ production of brGDGTs even though soils remained the main source of brGDGTs. Our results reveal that the influence of seasonal variation is relatively small, but can be clearly detected. Crenarchaeol was mostly produced in the river. Its concentration was lower during the HW season compared to that of the other seasons. Hence, our study shows the complexity of processes that influence the GDGT distribution during the transport from land to ocean. It emphasizes the importance of a detailed study of a river basin to interpret the MBT/CBT and BIT records for paleo reconstructions in adjacent marine setting...|$|E
40|$|International audienceGypsum {{dissolution}} can be {{the cause}} of damage associated with subsidence and collapse. In Paris, the authorities want to refine the current maps of the areas likely to be affected by ground movement due to gypsum dissolution in the Bartonian Saint Ouen Limestone and Beauchamp Sands, and in the Lutetian marl and limestone formation. The proposed method involves assessing separately the probabilities relative to factors that control the ground subsidence, i. e. : thickness of gypsum strata, sulphate-unsaturated water flows, groundwater level, thickness and nature of the overburden. The total susceptibility is represented in a map form by the product of these three values plotted on a grid map with a pixel size of 20 m. For this, we developed a multi-layer 3 D geological model using the same 20 m mesh grid, integrating 21 lithostratigraphic units. The hazard prone areas were calculated by geostatistical methods from the archived descriptions of more than 3900 boreholes and from existing geological maps. At the same time, the analysis of some 300 piezometers made it possible to construct the <b>High</b> <b>Water</b> (<b>HW)</b> and Low Water (LW) levels of the groundwater likely {{to have an impact on}} the dissolution of the gypsum. The obtained results correlate satisfactorily with the Parisian authorities' field knowledge and to the location of the known events.

Zooplankton samples were taken during 2 lunar cycles; during each lunar phase, 4 consecutive tidal cycles were sampled, and for each tidal cycle, 4 hauls were taken (flood, <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>HW),</b> ebb, low water (LW)). Short-term changes in species number, abundance, and biomass were studied. Salinity (mean, 7 ± 3 psu) and water level were positively correlated. Copepods dominated the zooplankton community. Numbers of total zooplankton and copepod species were high at HW and low at LW, irrespective of time of day and tide. In contrast, the abundance and biomass of both total zoo-plankton and copepods were high at LW and low at HW. Copepod species number and the abundances of total zooplankton and copepods were greater during the spring than the neap tide.

40|$|One of the {{greatest}} challenges in understanding the Amazon basin functioning is to ascertain the role played by floodplains in the organic matter (OM) cycle, crucial for a large spectrum of ecological mechanisms. Fatty acids (FAs) were combined with environmental descriptors and analyzed through multivariate and spatial tools (asymmetric eigenvector maps, AEM and principal coordinates of neighbor matrices, PCNM). This challenge allowed investigating the distribution of suspended particulate organic matter (SPOM), in order to trace its seasonal origin and quality, along a 800 km section of the Amazon river-floodplain system. Statistical analysis confirmed that large amounts of saturated FAs (15 : 0, 18 : 0, 24 : 0, 25 : 0 and 26 : 0), an indication of refractory OM, were concomitantly recorded with high pCO 2 in rivers, during the <b>high</b> <b>water</b> season (<b>HW).</b> Contrastingly, FAs marker which may be attributed in this ecosystem to aquatic plants (18 : 2 v 6 and 18 : 3 v 3) and cyanobacteria (16 : 1 v 7), were correlated with higher O 2, chlorophyll a and pheopigments in floodplains, due to a high primary production during low waters (LW). Decreasing concentrations of unsaturated FAs, that characterize labile OM, were recorded during HW, from upstream to downstream. Furthermore, using PCNM and AEM spatial methods, FAs compositions of SPOM displayed an upstream-downstream gradient during HW, which was attributed to OM retention and the extent of flooded forest in floodplains. Discrimination of OM quality between the Amazon River and floodplains corroborate higher autotrophic production in the latter and transfer of OM to rivers at LW season.

OBJETIVO: O objetivo deste trabalho foi conhecer a diversidade de gêneros, os atributos estruturais e a distribuição da comunidade de hidracáridos, como assim também a sua possível influência sobre certos parâmetros abióticos, na sub-bacia do Rio Grande, San Luis; MÉTODOS: estabeleceram-se quatro locais de amostragem (C 1, E 1, E 2 e E 3) em dois períodos hidrológicos: águas altas (AA) e águas baixas (AB). Obtiverem-se 24 amostras com rede Surber e se realizou a caracterização hidráulica, física e química dos locais de amostragem. Calculou-se a densidade (ind. m- 2), a riqueza genérica e o índice da diversidade de Shannon-Wiener; RESULTADOS: registraram-se 16 gêneros de hidracáridos. Não houve diferenças significativas entre cada local com relação aos parâmetros abióticos.

Nutrient concentrations were measured monthly for 2 years within the bed sediments of a 300 m reach located 20 km downstream from the dam. Due to strong hydrological fluctuations hyporheic water was analysed during natural low and <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>HW)</b> periods, and during water reservoir releases. Nutrient concentrations in surface water (SW) increased during water releases and in the HZ during the low water (LW) periods. Surface/hyporheic water interactions were characterized by determining the vertical hydraulic gradient (VHG) and the chemical signature of the ground water (GW). The latter was obtained from regional GW monitoring. Hyporheic chemistry was strongly influenced by patterns of surface flow. Hyporheic and SWs had similar chloride concentrations during high flow when they were significantly lower than those of the regional GW. GWwas generally richer in nitrates and nitrites, but was lower in ammonium concentrations than interstitial and river waters. Nitrates decreased significantly from upstream to downstream within the HZ throughout the hydrological period even though temporal fluctuations were high. Ammonium concentrations in interstitial water (IW) were significantly higher than in SWand generally increased from upstream to downstream. This study demonstrates the importance of the HZ in altering the dissolved inorganic nitrogen composition and concentrations of heavily polluted arid streams.

Typical clear-sky midday CO 2 uptake rates by the vegetation stand (including detritus, sediment or water surface) were 30 and 35 µmol CO 2 (ground) m– 2 s– 1 in the LW and HW periods, respectively. A rectangular hy-perbola model fitted the responses of “instantaneous” (20 - or 30 -min average) net CO 2 exchange rates to inci-dent photosynthetic photon flux densities (PFD) well. Stand evaporation rates were linearly related to PFD. The major difference in CO 2 uptake rates between the two periods was the larger respiration flux during LW due to the CO 2 efflux from sediment, roots and litter. In-tegrated 20 - or 30 -min fluxes were used to derive rela-tionships between daily CO 2 and H 2 O vapour fluxes and incident radiation. The daily CO 2 fluxes were almost lin-early related to incident radiation, but there was evidence of saturation at the highest daily radiation totals.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to {{investigate}} the suspended particle matter behavior and flocculation properties of a shallow mixed-sediment estuarine environment. As a part of the collaborative research project COHBED, this study presents unique results of the temporal and spatial variations of suspended sediment loads in an environment compromising both biologically active cohesive and non-cohesive sediments. The field study was conducted during spring tide in May 2013. Two fields sites representing a mixed-sediment environment with predominance of non-cohesive sediment (Site A) and cohesive sediments (Site B) were selected, and investigations were performed over two tidal cycles. Temporally Sites A and B showed an increase in suspended particle matter concentration (SPMC) (50 - 600 mg/l) with maxima one hour prior and subsequent to <b>high</b> <b>water</b> (<b>HW)</b> and minima at HW. The turbulent shear stress (TSS) (0 - 0. 25 N/m 2) and SPMC are found as the main drivers for floc formation. Site A exhibits a floc size range of 40 - 500 μm. A predominance of microflocs ( 160 μm) dominate the sediment suspension. Site B exhibits a floc size range of 40 - 700 μm. The great floc size range show a bi-modality of both high density macroflocs and low density (16 kg/m 3) microflocs throughout the tidal cycle. The spatial difference in floc size (D), settling velocity (ws) and effective density (⇢eff) is caused by the sand:mud ratio. Site A shows a predominance of dense possibly non-cohesive microflocs, while Site B shows a predominance of cohesive macroflocs. A greater abundance of macroflocs will thus be found at more cohesive sites in a mixed-sediment environment. Ultimately, the formation of flocs depends on the prevalent TSS and SPMC as well as the sand:mud ratio. The mean values of D, ws and ⇢eff during flood or ebb are not representative for the individual floc populations, as the variables show continuously changing developments. These results have implications for the numerical modeling and prediction of sediment transport within mixed-sediment environments...|$|E

The relative contribution to phytoplankton biomass from tributaries (mostly black waters) and from a few permanent lakes was low, and the main confluences resulted in phytoplankton dilution.

40|$|The {{cultivation}} of fast growing trees has high potential for bioenergy production on marginal lands. Information about the water use efficiency {{in combination with}} the ecophysiological response to drought stress is still incomplete. For the study of the transpiration-biomass relations satisfactory results can be obtained under controlled conditions by using lysimeters. Nonetheless, several technical problems related to the manufacturing can bias the outcome. Pan lysimeters are economical and relatively easy to assemble, however, saturation at the lower boundary can happen. On the other hand tension lysimeters, where the suction is applied by a vacuum pump, are effective but expensive and need constant maintenance. To avoid stagnancy and reduce production costs we assembled a tension controlled wick lysimeter, where the tension at the bottom layer is actively exerted by a hanging water column through the wick material (rockwool). We aim to assess the performance of the wick lysimeter coupled with an automatic irrigation system for the study of water use-yield relation black locust (Robinia pseudoacacia L.) under different irrigation regimes. The volumetric soil content for each treatment, namely low water (LW), medium <b>water</b> (MW) and <b>high</b> <b>water</b> amount (<b>HW),</b> was maintained at 0. 07, 0. 14 and 0. 2 m 3 m- 3 respectively. During the vegetation period (161 days) the plants growing at LW reduced their water use by 60 %, their leaf area by 40 % and the total above ground biomass by 46 %. As a result, we found a linear correlation (R 2 = 0. 98) between the relative biomass produced and the relative water use. The calculated relative water use efficiency (RWUE) for black locust total above ground dry biomass is 0. 96. Furthermore, after the harvest we evaluated the effectiveness of the lysimeter and irrigation system: the soil moisture of the treatments was kept up at the predefined values and an unsaturated condition at the boundary layer was maintained throughout the vegetation period. Because of the improved design no roots grew into the drainage extension and no unexpected change of the lysimeters hydraulic property occurred. Considering the relatively low-cost material used and the low maintenance needed, compared to other tension controlled lysimeters, wick lysimeters are effective tools for forestry studies of young trees...|$|R

Hydrogen <b>water</b> (<b>HW)</b> produced by electrolysis of water has characteristics of extremely low oxidation-reduction potential (ORP) value and high dissolved hydrogen (DH). It has been proved to have various beneficial effects including antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects; however, HW effect on atopic dermatitis (AD), an inflammatory skin disorder, is poorly documented. In the present study, we examined the immunological effect of drinking HW on Dermatophagoides farinae-induced AD-like skin in NC/Nga mice. Mice were administered with <b>HW</b> and purified <b>water</b> (PW) for 25 days. We evaluated the serum concentration of pro-inflammatory (TNF...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigated}} weathering performance of an HDPE wood plastic composite reinforced with extracted or delignified wood flour (WF). The wood flour was pre-extracted {{with three different}} solvents, toluene/ethanol (TE), acetone/water (AW), and hot <b>water</b> (<b>HW),</b> or sodium chlorite/acetic acid. The spectral properties of the composites before and after artificial weathering under accelerated conditions were characterized by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy, the surface color parameters were analyzed using colorimetry, and the mechanical properties were determined by a flexural test. Weathering of WPC resulted in a surface lightening {{and a decrease in}} wood index (wood/HDPE) and flexural strength. WPCs that were reinforced with delignified wood flour showed higher ΔL* and ΔE* values, together with lower MOE and MOR retention ratios upon weathering when compared to those with non-extracted control and extracted WF...|$|R

40|$|AbstractAn {{optimization}} {{strategy for}} scheduling various {{thermal energy storage}} capacities in an office building is investigated. An activated building wall (building thermal mass), a phase change material (PCM) tank, a hot <b>water</b> (<b>HW)</b> tank and a thermochemical material (TCM) storage are simulated and their charging and discharging behavior are optimized. Therefore, a case study is performed using a very simplified room model (office) and typical weather data for the Netherlands. To model the storage's scheduling behavior for control and optimization, a resistance capacitance (RC) network is applied. The RC network represents the critical energy storage parameters for optimization and control. The minimization of electricity costs is defined as optimization objective towards the Smart Grid. Cost saving potentials up to 12. 5 % are calculated using an electrical heat pump and a solar collector for heating the room and charging the thermal energy storage capacities...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT- In this study, the veridical {{efficacy}} of an aquatic disinfectant tablet composed to calcium hypochlo-rite against {{red sea bream}} iridovirus (RBIV). A veridical efficacy was determined with the viability of RBIV contacted with the disinfectant in viral stock cultured in fat head minnow cell line. An aquatic disinfectant tablet and RBIV were reacted on the distilled water (DW), hard <b>water</b> (<b>HW)</b> or organic matter suspension (OM) condition. On DW and HW condition, RBIV was inactivated with 25, 000 fold dilutions of an aquatic disinfectant tablet. With {{the investigation of the}} antiviral effect of the disinfectant on OM condition, RBIV was inactivated on 22, 000 fold dilutions of an aquatic disinfectant tablet. As an aquatic disinfectant tablet possesses veridical efficacy against RBIV, the disinfectant solution can be used to limit the spread of cultured marine fish viral disease.

40|$|The thermal {{stability}} of wood polymer composites made with extractive-free wood from four different wood species was studied. Hot <b>water</b> (<b>HW)</b> extractives, ethanol/cyclohexane (E/C) extractives and {{both types of}} extractives were eliminated from A. cyclops, E. grandis, P. radiata and Q. alba. Composites of LLDPE and 10 wt% of wood were prepared, using poly vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene (EVOH) as a compatibilizer. The thermal degradation behavior of the composites was characterized with thermogravimetric analysis (TGA). The obtained results showed that in all cases, the degradation temperatures shifted to higher values after removal of the extractives. The removal of E/C extractives was less effective in its improvement of the {{thermal stability}} than the removal of HW extractives. The largest improvement on the thermal stability of WPCs was achieved when both types of extractives (E/C and HW) were removed. © 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. Articl...|$|R

40|$|We {{examined}} whether {{consumption of}} hydrogen-rich <b>water</b> (<b>HW)</b> could ameliorate {{hematopoietic stem cell}} (HSC) injury in mice with total body irradiation (TBI). The results indicated that HW alleviated TBI-induced HSC injury with respect to cell number alteration and to the self-renewal and differentiation of HSCs. HW specifically decreased hydroxyl radical (OH∙) levels in the c-kit+ cells of 4 [*]Gy irradiated mice. Proliferative bone marrow cells (BMCs) increased and apoptotic c-kit+ cells decreased in irradiated mice uptaken with HW. In addition, the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) of γ-H 2 AX and percentage of 8 -oxoguanine positive cells significantly decreased in HW-treated c-kit+ cells, indicating that HW can alleviate TBI-induced DNA damage and oxidative DNA damage in c-kit+ cells. Finally, the cell cycle (P 21), cell apoptosis (BCL-XL and BAK), and oxidative stress (NRF 2, HO- 1, NQO 1, SOD, and GPX 1) proteins were significantly altered by HW in irradiated mouse c-kit+ cells. Collectively, the present results suggest that HW protects against TBI-induced HSC injury...|$|R
40|$|The {{diffusion}} {{characteristics of}} stable aqueous dispersion of "single-nano buckydiamond" concentration 80 mg/ml, {{average particle size}} 8 nm and pure water as the reference system were investigated by quasielastic neutron scattering. The difference of these spectra were analyzed by two ways. In the first way dispersion water was described as the two-component system, consisted of bulk water and a small additive having presumably the lorentzian form (Hydration <b>water,</b> <b>HW).</b> This additive {{is located in the}} nearest surrounding of nano-diamond particle. The second approach included the direct subtraction of dispersion water and bulk water spectra, properly normalized in the regions of their wings, where the influence of HW can be neglected. For both cases of analysis, the relative fraction HW appeared to be about 3 %. HW was found to have diffusive mobility which is retarded as compared to bulk water due to the weakening of the rotational component of diffusion and the increased residence lifetime of molecules.
