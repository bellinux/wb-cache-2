The latency of the indirect component increased when heart rate and contractility were decreased by burst stimulation (P = 0. 01; n = 7).

40|$|Abstract Background Experimental {{results are}} {{commonly}} fitted by determining parameter values of suitable mathematical expressions. In case a relation exists between different data sets, {{the accuracy of}} the parameters obtained can be increased by incorporating this relationship in the fitting process instead of fitting the recordings separately. Methods An algorithm to fit multiple measured curves simultaneously was developed. The method accounts for parameters that are shared by some curves. It can be applied to either linear or nonlinear equations. Simulated noisy "measurement results" were created to compare the introduced method to the "straight forward" way of fitting the curves separately. Results The analysis of the simulated measurements confirm, that the introduced method yields more accurate parameters compared to the ones gained by fitting the measurements separately. Therefore it needs more computer time. As an example, the new fitting algorithm is applied to the measurements of the <b>evoked</b> <b>compound</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> (ECAP) of the auditory nerve: This leads to promising ideas to reduce artefacts generated by the measuring process.

Animal experiments have shown that cathodic (negative) current flows are more effective than anodic (positive) ones in eliciting neural responses, and this finding has motivated the development of novel speech-processing algorithms.

In this study, we evaluated the statistical properties of the background noise (BN) and the post-average residual noise (RN) in ECAP measurements {{in order to determine}} a more objective detection criterion. For the estimation of the BN and the RN a method currently used in auditory brainstem response (ABR) measurements was applied. The potential benefit of using weighted (Bayesian) averages was also examined. All estimations were performed with a set of approximately 360 ECAP measurements recorded from 5 human CI users of the CII or HiRes 90 K device (Advanced Bionics). Results demonstrate that the BN was normally distributed and the RN decreased accordingly. No additional benefit was observed by using weighted averaging.

40|$|Objectives/Hypothesis: The {{variability}} in speech perception between cochlear implant users {{is thought to}} result from the degeneration of the auditory nerve. Degeneration of the auditory nerve, histologically assessed, correlates with electrophysiologically acquired measures, such as electrically <b>evoked</b> <b>compound</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> (eCAPs) in experimental animals. To predict degeneration of the auditory nerve in humans, where histology is impossible, this paper reviews the correlation between speech perception and eCAP recordings in cochlear implant patients. Data Sources: PubMed and Embase. Review Methods: We performed a systematic search for articles containing the following major themes: cochlear implants, evoked potentials, and speech perception. Two investigators independently conducted title-abstract screening, full-text screening, and critical appraisal. Data were extracted from the remaining articles. Results: Twenty-five of 1, 429 identified articles described a correlation between speech perception and eCAP attributes. Due to study heterogeneity, a meta-analysis was not feasible, and studies were descriptively analyzed. Several studies investigating presence of the eCAP, recovery time constant, slope of the amplitude growth function, and spatial selectivity showed significant correlations with speech perception. In contrast, neural adaptation, eCAP threshold, and change with varying interphase gap did not significantly correlate with speech perception {{in any of the}} identified studies. Conclusions: Significant correlations between speech perception and parameters obtained through eCAP recordings have been documented in literature; however, reporting was ambiguous.

The time necessary for full recovery of the response of the axons and the nerve endings, following stimulation at frequencies above 5 Hz, was not linearly related to the frequency of stimulation.

The latency of the response of axons and nerve endings was inversely proportional to the time interval between bursts. Prolonged stimulation of the isolated neural lobe with 'vasopressin'-like bursts induced the release of vasopressin. Twelve bursts, separated by 3 min intervals, released more hormone than fifty bursts given during the same period of time, but separated by a 21 s interval.

Repetitive nerve stimulation studies showed decremental responses in envenomed patients with post-tetanic potentiation followed by post-tetanic exhaustion. The {{findings are consistent with}} studies in vitro which suggested that the major action of neurotoxins in Australian taipan venom is at the synapse. The observation that electrophysiological data correlate closely with the clinical condition of the patient has potential application in the assessment of interventions in the management of snake bite victims...|$|R
40|$|OBJECTIVE: Electrically <b>evoked</b> <b>compound</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> (ECAPs) {{have been}} {{employed}} {{as a measure of}} neural activation evoked by cochlear implant (CI) stimulation. A forward-masking procedure is commonly used to reduce stimulus artefacts. This method estimates the joint neural activation produced by two electrodes - one acting as probe and the other as masker; as such, the measured ECAPs depend on the activation patterns produced by both. We describe an approach - termed Panoramic ECAP ("PECAP") - that allows reconstruction of the underlying neural activation pattern of individual channels from ECAP amplitudes. METHODS: The proposed approach combines two constrained nonlinear optimization stages. PECAP was validated against simulated and physiological data from CI users. The physiological data consisted of ECAPs measured from four users of Cochlear® devices. For each subject, an 18 × 18 ECAP amplitude matrix was measured using a forward-masking method. RESULTS: The results from computer simulations indicate that our approach can reliably estimate the underlying activation patterns from ECAP amplitudes even for instances of neural "dead regions" or cross-turn stimulation. The operating signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) for the proposed algorithm was 5 dB or higher, which matched well the SNR measured from human physiological data. Human ECAPs were fitted with our procedure to determine neural activation patterns. CONCLUSION: PECAP can be used to identify undesirable features of the neural activation pattern of individual CI users. SIGNIFICANCE: Our approach may have clinical application as an objective measure of electrode-to-neuron interface and may be used to devise ad hoc stimulation strategies...|$|R
40|$|Recent {{behavioral}} {{studies have}} suggested that the human auditory nerve of cochlear implant (CI) users is mainly excited by the positive (anodic) polarity. Those findings were only obtained using asymmetric pseudomonophasic (PS) pulses where the effect of one phase was measured {{in the presence of a}} counteracting phase of opposite polarity, longer duration, and lower amplitude than the former phase. It was assumed that only the short high-amplitude phase was responsible for the excitation. Similarly, it has been shown that electrically <b>evoked</b> <b>compound</b> <b>action</b> <b>potentials</b> could only be obtained in response to the anodic phases of asymmetric pulses. Here, experiment 1 measured electrically evoked auditory brainstem responses to standard symmetric, PS, reversed pseudomonophasic, and reversed pseudomonophasic with inter-phase gap (6 ms) pulses presented for both polarities. Responses were time locked to the short high-amplitude phase of asymmetric pulses and were smaller, but still measurable, when that phase was cathodic than when it was anodic. This provides the first evidence that cathodic stimulation can excite the auditory system of human CI listeners and confirms that this stimulation is nevertheless less effective than for the anodic polarity. A second experiment studied the polarity sensitivity at different intensities by means of a loudness balancing task between pseudomonophasic anodic (PSA) and pseudomonophasic cathodic (PSC) stimuli. Previous studies had demonstrated greater sensitivity to anodic stimulation only for stimuli producing loud percepts. The results showed that PSC stimuli required higher amplitudes than PSA stimuli to reach the same loudness and that this held for current levels ranging from 10 to 100 % of the dynamic range. 19 page(s...|$|R
