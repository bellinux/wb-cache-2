25|$|In revertive pulsing, the pulses {{were sent}} in the reverse {{direction}} to the sender, a complex and sophisticated piece of hardware. If a selector failed to advance, it stopped sending pulses to the sender. A timer in the sender detected the failure, returned a trouble tone to the caller, held the switch train out of service with a <b>grounded</b> <b>sleeve</b> lead so no other caller could use the faulty circuit. An automated alarm alerted maintenance staff.|$|R
50|$|Some {{computers}} {{now include}} a TRRS headset socket, compatible with headsets intended for smartphones. One such pin assignment, with <b>ground</b> on the <b>sleeve,</b> is standardized in OMTP {{and has been}} accepted as a national Chinese standard YDT 1885-2009.|$|R
5000|$|... : Maiko wear special kimono called hikizuri. They {{are usually}} 200 cm long, with a padded hem to create weight {{so it will}} trail beautifully on the floor. When outside a maiko will hold her hikizuri up with her hands, or tie it in place {{so that it does}} not touch the <b>ground.</b> The <b>sleeves</b> are long like a those of a furisode. The kimono can be any color and the motifs and {{patterns}} are seasonal. For formal occasions the maiko will wear a black hikizuri with 5 okiya crests.|$|R
50|$|Army Ground Forces {{survived the}} post-war {{reorganization}} of the War Department. It became Army Field Forces in 1948, Continental Army Command (CONARC) in 1955, and was ultimately divided into United States Army Forces Command (FORSCOM) and United States Army Training and Doctrine Command (TRADOC) in 1973. FORSCOM wears the former Army <b>Ground</b> Forces' shoulder <b>sleeve</b> insignia to this day.|$|R

Skirt is gathered at slightly dropped waist. Dress has a center back zipper, and is unlined. The dress is made of of areas of print. The bodice and {{upper part of the}} skirt has a geometric print of purple diamond/parallelagram shapes on red <b>ground.</b> The <b>sleeves</b> and lower part of the skirt have a print of large purple squares on red ground, forming a checkerboard pattern.

25|$|Supervision (line signaling) was {{supplied}} by a District circuit, {{similar to the}} plug and light cord circuit that plugged into a line jack on a switchboard. It supervised the calling and called party and, when both had gone on-hook, released the <b>ground</b> on the <b>sleeve</b> lead, thus releasing all selectors, which returned down to their start position to make ready for further traffic. Some District frames were equipped with the more complex supervisory and timing circuits required to generate coin collect and return signals for handling calls from payphones.|$|R
40|$|DE 10012487 A UPAB: 20001223 NOVELTY - The mast {{is mounted}} in a sleeve (1) in the <b>ground,</b> the <b>sleeve</b> {{comprising}} a weather-resistant material and containing a straight channel (3) {{with at least}} two entrances (5, 9), the first entrance (5) being wide enough to allow the mast to be inserted. The channel is narrowed at one or more points so that the outside of the mast is in direct contact with or very close {{to the inside of the}} sleeve, positioning the mast radially relative to the sleeve. At least one seal (8) inside the sleeve ensures a liquid-tight seal between the mast and sleeve. The second channel entrance (9) is oriented at 0 - 90 deg. with respect to the channel length axis (4), and at least one seal is provided close to this second entrance. DETAILED DESCRIPTION - INDEPENDENT CLAIMS are also included for (a) the use of the device for mounting round masts, and (b) a mast mounting methof using the device. USE - None given. ADVANTAGE - A mast can be mounted more quickly and corrosion or rotting of the base of the mast is better prevented...|$|R
40|$|We discuss thrust {{measurements}} of Dielectric Barrier Discharge (DBD) plasma actuators devices used for aerodynamic active flow control. After {{a review of}} our experience with conventional thrust measurement and significant non-repeatability of the results, we devised a suspended actuator test setup, and now present a methodology of thrust measurements with decreased uncertainty. The methodology consists of frequency scans at constant voltages. The procedure consists of increasing the frequency in a step-wise fashion from several Hz to the maximum frequency of several kHz, followed by frequency decrease {{back down to the}} start frequency of several Hz. This sequence is performed first at the highest voltage of interest, then repeated at lower voltages. The data in the descending frequency direction is more consistent and selected for reporting. Sample results show strong dependence of thrust on humidity which also affects the consistency and fluctuations of the measurements. We also observed negative values of thrust or "anti-thrust", at low frequencies between 4 Hz and up to 64 Hz. The anti-thrust is proportional to the mean-squared voltage and is frequency independent. Departures from the parabolic anti-thrust curve are correlated with appearance of visible plasma discharges. We propose the anti-thrust hypothesis. It states that the measured thrust is a sum of plasma thrust and anti-thrust, and assumes that the anti-thrust exists at all frequencies and voltages. The anti-thrust depends on actuator geometry and materials and on the test installation. It enables the separation of the plasma thrust from the measured total thrust. This approach enables more meaningful comparisons between actuators at different installations and laboratories. The dependence on test installation was validated by surrounding the actuator with a large diameter, <b>grounded,</b> metal <b>sleeve...</b>|$|R
50|$|LPS {{comprises}} a loose {{sleeve of}} polyethylene that completely wraps the pipe, including the bells of any joints. The sleeving inhibits corrosion {{by a number}} of mechanisms. It physically separates the pipe from soil particles, preventing direct galvanic corrosion. By providing an impermeable barrier to <b>ground</b> water, the <b>sleeve</b> also inhibits the diffusion of oxygen to the ductile iron surface and limits the availability of electrolytes that would accelerate corrosion. It provides a homogeneous environment along the pipe surface so that corrosion occurs evenly over the pipe. The sleeve also restricts the availability of nutrients which could support sulfate-reducing bacteria, inhibiting microbially induced corrosion. LPS is not designed to be completely water-tight but rather to greatly restrict the movement of water to and from the pipe surface. Water present beneath the sleeve and in contact with the pipe surface is rapidly deoxygenated and depleted of nutrients and forms a stable environment in which limited further corrosion occurs. An improperly installed sleeve that continues to allow the free flow of ground water is not effective in inhibiting corrosion.|$|R
40|$|A {{subsurface}} sampler {{including a}} cylindrical casing with portholes {{to provide access}} below ground to sample potentially hazardous substances without contaminating investigative probes that are inserted into the interior cavity of the casing. The sampler has an inner sleeve that seals the portholes on the casing during the insertion operation. After the casing is inserted into the <b>ground,</b> the inner <b>sleeve</b> is rotated such that the windows on the sleeve and casing line up exposing the soil {{to a variety of}} investigative probes. A tab or wiper is attached to the inner sleeve to clear soil blocking the portholes in the casing and to cut through the 2 ̆ 2 smear 2 ̆ 2 zone immediately along side of the outer surface of the casing. Once the sampler casing is in the ground and portholes are open, a sampling probe is inserted into the interior cavity of the casing following a track or guide system. When soil characterization is complete, the portholes can be closed off by turning the inner sleeve and capping the casing for future analyses, or the interior cavity may be filled with grout. The sampler casing is not intended to be removed unless the area is excavated...|$|R
