5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> De Soto {{continued}} {{to serve with}} the Navy, mostly in South American waters, until resold to her original owners in 1868 for resumption of service as a passenger ship. She caught fire and was burned to the waterline in December 1870.|$|E
5|$|After its {{founding}} in 1915, a large source of the Avery Brundage Company's business was wartime government contracts. Brundage, who applied for a commission in the Army Ordnance Corps but was rejected, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> {{became a member of}} the Construction Division Association, composed of men who had built facilities for the military, and later became its president from 1926 to 1928.|$|E
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> {{he served}} {{on a number of}} {{government}} bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. In later life, he became more philosophical, and published The Unreasonable Effectiveness of Mathematics in the Natural Sciences, his best-known work outside technical mathematics and physics.|$|E

25|$|The formal accords at the Yalta Conference, {{attended}} by U.S President Franklin Roosevelt, British Prime Minister Winston Churchill, and Soviet leader Joseph Stalin, were key in shaping Europe's {{balance of power}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b>|$|R
25|$|USS West Loquassuck {{undertook}} several transport missions for <b>the</b> Navy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> {{prior to}} decommission, and subsequently operated as the merchant ship SS West Loquassuck into the 1930s. She was scrapped in Baltimore in 1936.|$|R
5|$|The Regia Marina demobilized {{after the}} end of the war in 1918 and the {{draw-down}} continued into the 1920s in large part due to severe budgetary shortfalls <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> The engines installed on Nino Bixio and her sister proved to be problematic throughout her time in service, which ultimately cut her career short. She was stricken from the naval register on 15 March 1929 and subsequently broken up for scrap; in contrast, the much more efficient Quarto, which had been built before Nino Bixio, remained in service for another decade.|$|E
5|$|After leaving office, Voorhis {{remained}} in his Alexandria, Virginia, house, completing his book, Confessions of a Congressman. In early 1947, {{he was offered}} the job of {{executive director of the}} Cooperative League of the USA. The Voorhis family relocated to Winnetka, Illinois, near the League's Chicago headquarters. The League, which included both consumer and producer cooperatives, had fallen on hard times <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> Under his leadership, the League's financial position gradually improved and some major cooperatives that had remained aloof from the League were persuaded to join. The League expanded its purview, founding the Group Health Association of America and the National Association of Housing Cooperatives.|$|E
5|$|Feeling unsuited to a {{managerial}} role {{in such an}} environment, he left Oak Ridge at the end {{of summer}} in 1947 and returned to Princeton University, although he maintained a consulting role with the facility for many years. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> he served on a number of government bodies, including the National Bureau of Standards from 1947 to 1951, the mathematics panel of the National Research Council from 1951 to 1954, the physics panel of the National Science Foundation, and the influential General Advisory Committee of the Atomic Energy Commission from 1952 to 1957 and again from 1959 to 1964. He also contributed to civil defense.|$|E
50|$|The Percival Prentice {{is a basic}} trainer of the Royal Air Force <b>in</b> <b>the</b> early <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b> It was a low-wing {{monoplane}} with a fixed tailwheel undercarriage. Front seating was in a side-by-side configuration with a {{rear seat}} provided.|$|R
25|$|Edenton briefly served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> U.S. Navy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{immediate}} <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> as USS Edenton (ID-3696), {{participating in}} a famine relief mission to Eastern Europe before decommissioning <b>in</b> 1919.

50|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> {{turbulent}} <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> <b>the</b> 22-year-old Büchner flew against communist revolutionaries but {{was shot}} down and killed {{by members of the}} Spartacus League during a reconnaissance flight near his hometown of Leipzig on March 18, 1920, three days after Berthold was murdered in Harburg.|$|R
5|$|<b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> Lawton {{underwent}} tremendous growth {{during the}} late 1940s and 1950s, leading city officials to seek additional water sources to supplement existing water from Lake Lawtonka. In the late 1950s, the city purchased large parcels of land along East Cache Creek in northern Comanche County {{for the construction of}} a man-made lake with a dam built in 1959 on the creek just north of U.S. 277 west of Elgin. Lake Ellsworth, named for a former Lawton mayor, soft-drink bottler C.R. Ellsworth, was dedicated in the early 1960s. It offered additional water resources, but also recreational opportunities and flood control along Cache Creek.|$|E
5|$|In 1917, {{two summers}} before the Chicago riot, {{extensive}} and deadly race riots {{broke out in}} the expanding, war-time cities of East St. Louis, Illinois, and Houston, Texas, influencing the violent events of Red Summer across the nation and in Chicago. The postwar period also found tensions rising in numerous cities where populations were increasing rapidly. People from different cultures jostled against each other and competed for space. In 1917, the Chicago Real Estate Board established a policy of block by block segregation. New arrivals in the Great Migration generally joined old neighbors on the South Side. By 1920, the area held 85% of Chicago's African Americans--middle and upper class and poor. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> veterans of all groups were looking to re-enter the work force. Some whites resented African-American veterans. At the same time, African-American veterans exhibited greater militancy and pride as a result of having served to protect their country. They expected to be treated as full citizens after fighting for the nation. Meanwhile, younger black men rejected the passivity traditional of the South and promoted armed self-defense and control of their neighborhoods.|$|E

25|$|West Eldara briefly {{served with}} <b>the</b> U.S. Navy <b>in</b> <b>the</b> {{immediate}} <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> as <b>the</b> auxiliary ship USS West Eldara (ID-3704), completing two relief missions to Europe before decommissioning. Between the wars, West Eldara operated as a merchant ship in transatlantic service. In 1936 she was renamed SS Mae.|$|R
25|$|The {{reputation}} of Haj Amin al-Husseini among Jews <b>in</b> <b>the</b> immediate <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> {{is indicated by}} the observation by Raul Hilberg that when culpability {{for the destruction of}} the European Jews was debated in 1945, al-Husseini was the only specific individual singled out to be put on trial.|$|R
25|$|In February 1934, {{some time}} after his {{memorial}} service, his literary friends held an event where they organized his unpublished manuscripts. These were slowly published over the following decade, and his fame increased rapidly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period.</b>|$|E
25|$|Unlike his competitors, John Roach {{had been}} able to {{maintain}} his profits <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period</b> by diversifying his plant into the manufacture of machine tools and selling them to the U.S. Navy, which {{was in the process of}} upgrading its shipyards. By contrast, the Morgan Iron Works, like most other New York engine builders, had struggled <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> building only two engines in the two years following the war. It remained in business only because Morgan could afford to weather the losses, but in 1866 he suffered an additional financial setback when his newly established shipping lines to Mexico were aborted due to the overthrow of Maximilian I of Mexico.|$|E
25|$|The {{steelband}} {{developed during}} wartime. They were preceded by the Tambu Bamboo bands, which used percussion instruments based on bamboo.

25|$|The cutters served {{mostly on}} patrol and convoy escort duty during the war. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>postwar</b> <b>period,</b> some {{were used as}} {{transports}} for government officials {{in addition to their}} normal duties.
