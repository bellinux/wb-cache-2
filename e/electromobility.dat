50|$|Commission {{will provide}} a total of €24 million in funding to support the project. According to the EU Commissioner for Transport, Siim Kallas, Green eMotion aims to link the {{currently}} ongoing regional and national <b>electromobility</b> initiatives, apply their results, and compare the different technology approaches, to support the best possible solutions for the European market. This platform will allow for co-operation among the various players and promote both new, high-quality transportation services and convenient payment systems for the users of electric vehicles. Thus, the Commission is {{paving the way for}} the creation of a mass market for electric vehicles in the EU. In selected demonstration regions, 43 project partners, including industrial enterprises and automotive companies, power utilities, municipal governments and universities, as well as testing and research institutions, are studying the conditions to make that goal a reality. Green eMotion is part of the Transport 2050 Roadmap, an EU strategy paper that strives to bring about a 60% reduction in CO2 emissions from road transportation by the year 2050.|$|E
50|$|The study {{completed}} by Vaishnaw et al. sought {{to identify the}} key region and factors related {{to the efforts of}} gene expression of the C4 gene. Their research concluded {{with the fact that the}} Sp1 binding site (positioned at -59 to -49) plays an important role in accurately starting basal transcription of C4. Utilization of <b>electromobility</b> shift assays and DNase I footprint analyses demonstrated specific DNA-protein correlations of the C4 promoter at the nuclear factor 1, two E box (-98 to -93 and -78 to -73), and Sp1 binding domains. These findings were later added to in another extensive study, that found a third E box site. In addition, the same findings postulated that two physical entities within the gene sequence could have a role in the expression levels of human C4A and C4B, which include the both presence of the endogenous retrovirus that can have positive or negative regulatory influences affecting C4 transcription and the varying genetic environment (dependent on which genetic modular component is present) past position -1524.|$|E
50|$|An analogical {{conclusion}} {{from the}} historical development of automobility {{can be drawn}} for the acceptance of <b>electromobility.</b> Accordingly, the spread of two-wheeled automobiles was a precursor to that of the four-wheeled automobile. This suggests that it would be advisable to devote particular attention to the market development of electric bicycles and motorcycles. The debate on net neutrality calls on the one hand for a network that does not distinguish between communications {{on the basis of their}} content and in which data is treated the same irrespective of the sender and receiver. The aim is to avoid competition-distorting measures that would promote the formation of a monopoly. In the case of a data bottleneck in the Internet, no distinction is made in terms of the content being transported. On the other hand, the debate also calls for an egalitarian net that does not admit differences in service class. This means in turn that there is no way of ensuring the service quality of a particular transmission. In this example, knowledge can be enhanced by drawing analogical conclusions from public road traffic: mechanisms such as special lanes for buses or bicycles in cities, special rights for emergency vehicles of the rescue services, from regulations, such as those controlling oversize transports or convoys, and from a drop in or absence of marginal costs, represented by an Internet flat rate. Each of these displays interesting isomorphic analogies.|$|E
