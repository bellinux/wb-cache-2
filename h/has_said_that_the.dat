5|$|Writer Rhianna Pratchett <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> game's story {{examined}} why citizens {{would accept}} {{a life in}} a society where their personal choices were very limited.

5|$|Because he {{was delayed}} {{in getting the}} website online, Munroe {{had a lot of}} time {{thinking}} about the design of the blog. He eventually chose to display his entries as individual pages rather than using an infinite scrolling page, as he considers the latter more difficult to digest. Munroe usually chooses questions he already knows something interesting about, or after reading a scientific paper, he keeps an eye out for questions in which he can bring it up. Munroe <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> volume of questions has been high enough that it is impossible to read all of them. Answering a question and writing a post takes him about a day of solid work.|$|E

5|$|Collins <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> main {{inspiration}} for The Hunger Games trilogy {{came from the}} classical account of Theseus and the Minotaur. In Greek mythology, as a punishment for the killing of King Minos's son Androgeos, Athens was forced to sacrifice seven youths and seven maidens to Crete, who were then put in the Labyrinth and killed by the Minotaur. After a while, Theseus, {{the son of the}} Athenian king, decided {{to put an end to}} the Minotaur and Minos's terror, so he volunteered to join the third group of victims, ultimately killing the Minotaur and leading his companions out of the monster's Labyrinth.|$|E

5|$|In 2004 {{planning}} applications were submitted {{for a new}} bridge, the Thames Gateway Bridge, close to the Woolwich Ferry; however the project was cancelled in 2008.

The option of a bridge is still popular, with an alternative option of a tunnel in the area.

For the scores that she collaborated on with Eguchi, she was {{responsible for most of}} the jazzy tracks, while Eguchi provided the majority of the electronic music. Matsueda <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> best qualities of a composer are their curiosity and sensitivity, and that watching many things, listening, touching, and feeling are important factors in composition.

5|$|Numerous senior central {{bankers and}} finance ministers issued public warnings, the first being Alexei Ulyukayev, the first deputy {{chairman}} at Russia's central bank. He was later joined by many others including Park Jae-wan, the finance minister for South Korea, and by Jens Weidmann, {{president of the}} Bundesbank. Weidmann held the view that interventions during the 2009–11 period were not intense enough to count as competitive devaluation, but that a genuine currency war is now a real possibility. Japan's economy minister Akira Amari <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Bank of Japan's bond buying programme is intended to combat deflation, and not to weaken the yen.|$|E

5|$|Antichrist Superstar is a rock opera concept album, and {{its title}} {{is based on}} the 1971 Andrew Lloyd Webber musical Jesus Christ Superstar. It is {{primarily}} an industrial metal record, and contains material which has been described as industrial rock and death metal, as well as progressive metal, new wave and gothic rock. The album's central storyline revolves around a supernatural being who seizes power in order to initiate an apocalyptic end event. The record is a social critique which utilizes this premise {{as a metaphor for the}} fascist elements of the Christian right in North America. The band's frontman <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> underlying concept of Antichrist Superstar was both inspired by and a tribute to the work of German philosopher Friedrich Nietzsche, specifically his philosophical concept of an Übermensch.|$|E

5|$|In January 1998, the {{government}} made a Statement of Reconciliation– including an apology {{to those people}} who were sexually or physically abused while attending residential schools– and established the Aboriginal Healing Foundation (AHF). The Foundation was provided with $350million to fund community-based healing projects addressing the legacy of physical and sexual abuse. In its 2005 budget, the Canadian government committed an additional $40million to support the work of the AHF. Federal funding for the foundation was cut in 2010 by the Stephen Harper government, leaving 134 national healing-related initiatives without an operating budget. The AHF closed in 2014. Former AHF executive director Mike DeGagne <b>has</b> <b>said</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> loss of AHF support has created a gap in dealing with mental health crises such as suicides in the Attawapiskat First Nation.|$|E
