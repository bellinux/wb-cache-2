To {{provide with}} an {{effective}} method for non-photorealistic rendering for computer generated images with sketch artistic appearances from 2 D images motivates our {{work in this}} paper. The character of lines, details in the source <b>image</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> smoothed by the technique of guided filter, and then the abstract smooth appearance of the <b>image</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> simulated. In addition, the smooth effect <b>can</b> <b>be</b> enlarged and enhanced by the technique of improved line integral convolution, so the final sketch artistic <b>image</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> obtained. Experimental {{results show that the}} proposed method can simulate the real sketch effect. 1...|$|R

25|$|Because fundoscopic {{images are}} the main sources for {{diagnosis}} of diabetic retinopathy, manually analyzing those <b>images</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> time-consuming and unreliable, as the ability of detecting abnormalities varies by years of experience. Therefore, scientists have explored developing computer-aided diagnosis approaches to automate the process, which involves extracting information about the blood vessels and any abnormal patterns {{from the rest of}} the fundoscopic image and analyzing them.|$|E
25|$|All luminance–chrominance formats {{used in the}} {{different}} TV and video standards such as YIQ for NTSC, YUV for PAL, YDBDR for SECAM, and YPBPR for component video use color difference signals, by which RGB color <b>images</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> encoded for broadcasting/recording and later decoded into RGB again to display them. These intermediate formats were needed for compatibility with pre-existent black-and-white TV formats. Also, those color difference signals need lower data bandwidth compared to full RGB signals.|$|E
25|$|Diabetic {{retinopathy}} is {{a disease}} of the retina that is diagnosed predominantly by fundoscopic images. Diabetic patients in industrialised countries generally undergo regular screening for the condition. Imaging is used to recognize early signs of abnormal retinal blood vessels.

25|$|The {{technique}} {{is limited to}} imaging 1 to 2mm below the surface in biological tissue, because at greater depths the proportion of light that escapes without scattering {{is too small to}} be detected. No special preparation of a biological specimen is required, and <b>images</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> obtained ‘non-contact’ or through a transparent window or membrane. It is also {{important to note that the}} laser output from the instruments is low – eye-safe near-infra-red light is used – and no damage to the sample is therefore likely.|$|E
25|$|Pattern based {{algorithms}} {{compare the}} basic fingerprint patterns (arch, whorl, and loop) between a previously stored template and a candidate fingerprint. This {{requires that the}} <b>images</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> aligned in the same orientation. To do this, the algorithm finds a central point in the fingerprint image and centers on that. In a pattern-based algorithm, the template contains the type, size, and orientation of patterns within the aligned fingerprint image. The candidate fingerprint image is graphically compared with the template to determine {{the degree to which}} they match.|$|E
30|$|In this paper, {{we propose}} a LDSM method for solving {{functional}} MRI sequence reconstruction problem. Based on a key {{assumption that the}} variations of functional MR images are sparse over time in the wavelet domain, our method models an fMRI sequence as a linear dynamic sparse model. By using the linear sparse model, the prior information of the unknown fMRI <b>image</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> extracted from the previous fMRI image and the sparse variations. The prior information, expressing certainty and uncertainty of an unknown <b>image,</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> employed to boost the reconstructed image quality. Firstly, {{the uncertainty of the}} <b>image</b> <b>can</b> <b>be</b> used to guide the measurement so that more useful information <b>can</b> <b>be</b> obtained. Secondly, even when the number of measurements is under-determined, a high quality <b>image</b> <b>can</b> still <b>be</b> generated by involving its prior information in the reconstruction process. For this reason, the reconstruction and measurement design algorithms that adopt the linear dynamic sparse model are preferred.|$|R

When sliding the trapezoid towards lower Hounsfield unit values, more structures with lower attenuation will be included (e.g., smaller vessels), and vice versa.|$|R
