25|$|As {{a result}} of the {{profound}} economic and social changes induced by postwar industrialization, including low birth rates, an aging population and thus a shrinking workforce, during the 1980s Italy became to attract rising flows of foreign immigrants. The present-day figure of about 5 million foreign residents, that make up some 9% of the total population, include 97,000 children born in Italy to foreign nationals (19% of total births in Italy) in 2014, but exclude foreign nationals who have subsequently acquired Italian nationality; this applied to 106,000 people in 2014. The official figures also exclude illegal immigrants, the so-called clandestini, whose numbers are very difficult to determine. In May 2008 The Boston Globe quoted an estimate of 670,000 for this group. Since the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989, and more recently, the 2004 and 2007 enlargements of the European Union, the main waves of migration came from the former socialist countries of Eastern Europe (especially Romania, Albania, Ukraine and Poland). The second most important area of immigration to Italy has always been the neighbouring North Africa (in particular, Morocco, Egypt and Tunisia), with soaring arrivals {{as a consequence of the}} Arab Spring. Furthermore, in recent years, growing migration fluxes from the Far East (notably, China and the Philippines) and Latin America (Ecuador, Peru) have been recorded. Currently, circa one million Romanians (around one tenth of them being Roma) are officially registered as living in Italy, representing thus the most important individual country of origin, followed by Albanians and Moroccans with about 500,000 people each. The number of unregistered Romanians is difficult to estimate, but the Balkan Investigative Reporting Network suggested that in 2007 that there might have been half a million or more.

This study uses mapping software to visually represent risk factor information with areas of known Ae. aegypti populations. This study focused on known demographic risk factors such as race/ethnicity, place of birth, gender as well as socioeconomic status represented by educational attainment and income. This study found that there are several areas, particularly in central Harris County that are at particular risk for dengue transmission. The findings support the hypothesis that in areas of lower socioeconomic status there were increased <b>populations</b> of <b>foreign</b> <b>born</b> <b>populations,</b> Hispanic populations, and identified locations of a competent vector present.

40|$|Background: During the 1920 s {{and early}} 1930 s, U. S. {{fertility}} declined overall but with large regional variations. Changes in <b>foreign</b> <b>born</b> <b>populations</b> explain {{only part of}} this. Differences in public health and poverty relief programs may further help explain these declines because of their potential impact on fertility determinants, in particular on breastfeeding and child mortality. Objective: We investigate whether public health investments in child health (conservation of child life programs) and poverty relief (outdoor care of poor or charity for children and mothers) affected fertility for U. S. cities over 100, 000 persons between 1923 and 1932. Methods: We analyze data covering 64 cities between 1923 - 1932 that include birth information from the U. S. Birth, Stillbirth and Infant Mortality Statistics volumes and city financial information from the Financial Statistics of Cities volumes. Time and city fixed-effects models are used to identify the impact of public investments on fertility. Results: Fixed effects estimates indicating the conservation of child life programs explain about 10 percent of the fertility change between 1923 and 1932. Outdoor care of poor {{did not seem to}} be related to fertility. Investments in charity for children and mothers were associated with fertility increases, possibly because poorer areas experienced relative increases in both higher fertility and charitable spending. Conclusions: Public spending on child health was strongly related to decreasing fertility in the U. S. during the 1920 s, possibly because of increased breastfeeding and decreased child mortality.

40|$|Although {{the civil}} rights era in America is over, there are still {{questions}} about how we can make the system work more efficiently and aggregate preferences of all voters. There is obvious under-representation of minorities relative to their population in many localities. The reasons for this may be a myriad of causes; lack of education, poor voter mobilization, large <b>foreign</b> <b>born</b> <b>populations,</b> or a legal or structural barrier to voting. Specifically in this proposal we seek to end multi member-at large voting districts as a means of election, mobilize voters through political structures/apparatus, and educate voters to participate in the process. This problem affects the Latino population in this region the most, other minorities are also at risk; but, Latinos are the largest underrepresented group. This problem came to my attention through developing a case study on the city politics and voter participation of the Latino community in Sunnyside, Washington. Although, most of their at large election system has been repealed there is still some at-large voting in this community. There is a huge amount of under-representation in this community. This lack of representation comes from not just one source, but many.
