He allegedly absconded before the damages could be settled. According to interviews with China Central Television and Xinhua News Agency, Gui said that he had been consumed with guilt and had returned to China in October to face the consequences of his misdeed.|$|E
5|$|A {{division}} of the U.S. Department of Transportation, the Federal Motor Carrier Safety Administration (FMCSA) regulates nearly {{all aspects of the}} trucking industry. Truck drivers are limited by the number of daily and weekly hours they may drive, the roads and highways they may drive upon, and a lower legal definition of drunkenness. The Federal Highway Administration has established 0.04 percent as the blood alcohol concentration (BAC) level at or above which a CMV driver is deemed to be driving under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> States maintain a BAC level between 0.08 and 0.10 percent for non-CMV drivers. In some states, trucks also have special speed limits, in addition to restrictions on driving in certain lanes (normally the far right lanes of multi-lane highways).|$|E

40|$|In this Thesis, {{we studied}} the stablity of {{lysozyme}} solutions with temperature and the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> (ethanol, propan- 1 -ol, 2 -methoxyethanol) on lysozyme structure. Within {{the limits of}} pH 3 to 10, the protein is rather stable and is not much influenced by concentrations up to 40 % <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> (for ethanol and propanol), or 9 % of 2 -methoxyethanol. Lowering or increase of pH (to 1. 9 or 11, respectively) destabilizes the protein to some extent; this effect is more pronounced for the longer alkyl chain of propanol. The temperature stability of lysozyme up to 55 řC observed for solutions with pH 3 and 7 is {{in accordance with the}} data in literature, as well as the observation of some thermal denaturation starting between 45 an 50 řC in acidic solution (pH 1. 9). Also at alkaline pH, the stability is lowered, and the protein is partially precipitated.

5|$|Much of {{the extant}} {{information}} about {{the last few days}} of Poe's life comes from his attending physician, Dr. John Joseph Moran, though his credibility is questionable. Poe was buried after a small funeral at the back of Westminster Hall and Burying Ground, but his remains were moved to a new grave with a larger monument in 1875. The newer monument also marks the burial place of Poe's wife, Virginia, and his mother-in-law, Maria. Theories as to what caused Poe's death include suicide, murder, cholera, hypoglycemia, rabies, syphilis, influenza, and that Poe was a victim of cooping. Evidence of the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> is strongly disputed.|$|E

Executive producers and writers Carlton Cuse and Damon Lindelof left the identity of the sixth deliberately ambiguous to provoke debate after the episode.|$|E
5|$|Following its {{announcement}} in May 2006, Grand Theft Auto IV was widely anticipated. Upon release, the game received universal critical acclaim, with praise particularly {{directed at the}} game's narrative and open world design. However, the game also generated controversy, with criticism directed at the game's depiction of violence and players' ability to drive under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b> Grand Theft Auto IV broke industry sales records and became the fastest-selling entertainment product in history at the time, earning US $310 million in its first day and US $500 million in its first week. Considered {{one of the most}} significant titles of the seventh generation of video games, and by many critics as one of the greatest video games of all time, it won year-end accolades, including Game of the Year awards from several gaming publications. A sequel, Grand Theft Auto V, was released in September 2013.|$|E
40|$|Experiments with colloid systems {{attempted}} {{to achieve a}} better understanding of biological processes. The <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> on phosphatid coacervates was compared with their influence upon the protoplasmic membrane of living cells of the alga Chara ceratophylla. Some similarity could be seen between the <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> methanol, ethanol and butanol. But the alcohols exerted their influence upon the living membrane at much lower concentration than they did on the phosphatid coacervates (ratio 1 : 10) and on the dielectric medium (1 : 10). Propanol, however, decreased the permeability of the living protoplast, in the opinion of the author by condensation of the membrane, but opened up the phosphatid coacervate. Very low concentrations of propanol could, however, increase the permeability of the protoplasmic membrane in a similar way as it increased the volume of the coacervate. In explaining the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohols</b> on the permeability of the protoplasmic membrane the author considered: action on the carbon chains of the membrane components; action on the dielectric condition of the system; the structure of the system (amorphous or oriented). The use of phosphatid coacervates as a model did not mean that the protoplasmic membrane was thought to be an amorphous system. Alcohols would probably open up a protoplasmic membrane composed of oriented components. <p/...|$|R

5|$|In a 5–4 opinion, the Court {{held that}} forced {{extraction}} {{and analysis of}} a blood sample is not compelled testimony; therefore, it does not violate the Fifth Amendment privilege against self-incrimination. The Court also held that intrusions into the human body ordinarily require a search warrant. However, the Court ruled that the involuntary, warrantless blood sample taken {{in this case was}} justified under the Fourth Amendment's exigent circumstances exception because evidence of blood alcohol would be destroyed by the body's natural metabolic processes if the officers were to wait for a warrant. In 2013, the Supreme Court clarified in Missouri v. McNeely that the natural metabolism of alcohol in the bloodstream is not a per se exigency that would always justify warrantless blood tests of individuals suspected of driving under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{state of}} civil {{disorder}} {{existed in the}} island's mountainous region after {{the invasion of the}} United States. The local Criollo, who now found themselves unemployed and felt that they had been exploited by their former employers, formed bands called 'Partidas". The Partidas, at first attacked and robbed many of the wealthy plantation owners, who were loyal to the Spanish Crown, in vengeance, however they later began to attack the businesses owned by the local natives. One of the most notable leaders of the Partidas was José Maldonado Román a.k.a. 'Aguila Blanca". Maldonado, who operated in the areas of Juana Díaz and Ponce, harassed the Spanish Civil Guard and later did the same to the American Forces. Another factor contributing to the state of civil disorder on the island was the lack of discipline of the American troops who were stationed on the island. These troops were not professional soldiers and were composed of volunteers. Many instances were reported where these men would act disorderly, under the <b>influence</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and get into fights with the local residents. The state of civil disorder came to a halt on the island after the military government began to rebuild Puerto Rico's infrastructure, thereby providing employment for many of the discontented and unemployed population, and when the volunteer troops were replaced by the regular Army.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{negative}} <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> on TB management {{with regard}} to delays in seeking care as well as non compliance for treatment has been well documented. This study {{is part of a}} larger study on the prevalence <b>of</b> AUD (<b>Alcohol</b> Use Disorder) among TB patients which revealed that almost a quarter of TB patients who consumed alcohol could be classified as those who had AUD. However there is dearth <b>of</b> any effective <b>alcohol</b> intervention programme for TB patients with Alcohol Use Disorder (AUD). METHODOLOGY: This qualitative study using the ecological system model was done to gain insights into the perceived effect <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> use on TB treatment and perceived necessity of an intervention programme for TB patients with AUD. We used purposive sampling to select 44 men from 73 TB patients with an AUDIT score > 8. Focus group discussions (FGDs) and interviews were conducted with TB patients with AUD, their family members and health providers. RESULTS: TB patients with AUD report excessive alcohol intake as one of the reasons for their vulnerability for TB. Peer pressure has been reported by many as the main reason for <b>alcohol</b> consumption. The <b>influences</b> <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> use on TB treatment has been elaborated especially {{with regard to}} the fears around the adverse effects <b>of</b> <b>alcohol</b> on TB drugs and the fear of being reprimanded by health providers. The need for alcohol intervention programs was expressed by the TB patients, their families and health providers. Suggestions for the intervention programmes included individual and group sessions, involvement of family members, audiovisual aids and the importance of sensitization by health staff. CONCLUSIONS: The findings call for urgent need based interventions which need to be pilot tested with a randomized control trial to bring out a model intervention programme for TB patients with AUD...|$|R
