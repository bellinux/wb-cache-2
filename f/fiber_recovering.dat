The solid content of the emulsion reached 40 % using reasonable reactive emulsifier contents and feeding modes. Then, two kinds of <b>fibers</b> (<b>recovered</b> and hardwood <b>fiber)</b> were respectively dispersed, coated, and dried with emulsion. Finally, fiber-based water-resistant material was successfully fabricated. The experimental results showed that under the conditions of a mass ratio of polyacrylic emulsion to fiber of 2 : 1, the Cobb value of the material reached 7. 1 g/m 2 and 10. 8 g/m 2 respectively. Cobb value of <b>recovered</b> <b>fiber</b> material was more stable than hardwood fiber, and stayed in a lower variation scope on the whole. Using scanning electron microscopy (SEM) to observe the surface morphology of products. The SEM results proved that, the polyacrylic emulsion filled the gaps between fibers, decreased the porous structure. This filling effect led to a continuous structure, and kept the water from infiltrating inside of the material. On the other hand, for the short <b>fiber</b> in <b>recovered</b> <b>fiber</b> material arranged closer, the water resistance of the material was further enhanced...|$|R

Glass <b>fibers</b> were <b>recovered</b> from glass-polyester composites, and carbon and aramide fibers from epoxy based composites. From the different fractions obtained after grinding, a specific fibrous fraction was selected for reuse. This recycled fraction was first characterized in terms of length and residual matrix content, and then incorporated into virgin polymer matrices to prepare new thermoplastic composites. To evaluate the performance of these composites, tensile tests were initially carried out, and the results were compared with similar measurements performed on pristine composites containing short unused fibers of similar length. In most cases examined, recycling does not adversely affect the mechanical performance of the new composite. This overall behavior is explained in terms of fiber length preservation, fiber dispersion mechanism and fiber-matrix adhesion...|$|R

When Bell’s palsy occurs {{one of the most important}} question is what will the prognosis be. In this study we used EnoG (Electroneuronography) for determining prognosis and used House-Brackmann grading system for measured the recovery. Material and Methods: In this study 87 patient who presented to our clinic with Bell palsy in first three days after the paralysis began was examined. House-Brackmann grading system was used for all patient’s to grading facial paralysis and recovery. For determining the prognosis EnoG was performed to all patient among to third and fourteenth days after the facial paralysis had began.

40|$|Was {{this group}} of target fibers {{transferred}} during a criminal action? Is it possible that it was transferred during another legitimate activity? Acquiring knowledge about the activity, whether legitimate or criminal, leading to the transfer {{of a group of}} fibers is a recurring challenge encountered throughout the evidence interpretation process. Trace evidence such as fibers may assist with generating a reasoning of the activity which produced the trace, but this assumes that one already has a thorough understanding of the transfer phenomenon. How to generate and then use such relevant knowledge? What are the influencing parameters and which ones should (or can) be controlled? The present work focuses on homicides by smothering using a pillow and the transfer of fibers {{on the face of the}} victim in such events. A legitimate activity – represented by a night’s sleep on a pillow – was also investigated since such legitimate, alternative explanations concerning the presence of fibers could likely be formulated by the suspect. The number and distribution of fibers transferred onto the victim’s face in either scenario were investigated and interpreted using a Bayesian approach. Results showed that the shedding capacity of the pillowcase strongly impact the number of <b>fibers</b> <b>recovered.</b> The nature of the action, modus operandi and amount of friction could not be excluded in their influence on the transfer of fibers. Finally, likelihood ratios indicating the number of <b>fibers</b> <b>recovered</b> from the victim’s face can provide relevant information by supporting either criminal or legitimate proposition (i. e., smothering or night’s sleep scenario) ...|$|R

A possible mechanism for the bending behavior is as follow: (1) the fiber is heated upon illumination because of the photothermal effect, (2) the fiber loses water molecules, (3) the fiber shrinks; bending towards the direction of the flat surface of the fiber occurs because of a difference in the shrinkage for the flat surface and {{the other side of the}} fiber.

40|$|Tetrodotoxin, a toxic {{substance}} {{obtained from the}} globe fish, {{has been known to}} paralise the neuromuscular system as well as the central nervous system and recently, it was found to block production of the action potential through its selective inhibition of the sodium-carrying mechanism, but has no effect on the resting potential. In this paper, the effects of tetrodotoxin on the four kinds of skeletal muscle fibers were compared and analysed. Four muscle fibers are tonic and phasic fibers of the extrafusal muscle, and nuclear-bag and nuclear-chain fibers of the intrafusal muscle fibers. The extrafusal muscle is a dynamic source of posture and locomotion, the intrafusal muscle being the regulating source of them. Paralysis of the extrafusal muscle fibers was determined by measuring the decrease in maximum contraction of the soleus (tonic muscle) and tibialis anterior (phasic) produced stimulation of the distal cut end of the ventral root. Paralysis of the intrafusal muscle fibers wasmeasured by a change in the frequency of Group la discharge led from the functionally isolated single filaments of the distal cut end of the dorsal root. By intravenous administration of 4 γ/kg tetrodotoxin, paralysis advaces beginning with the intrafusal muscle fibers, and then on to the tonic muscle and phasic muscle <b>fibers.</b> They <b>recover</b> according to the same order. When the intrafusal muscle <b>fiber</b> <b>recovers</b> during an advance in paralysis of the extrafusal muscle, intrafusal muscle fibers contract by the γ-efferent activated by stimulation of the ventral root, and the Group la discharge increases. Frequency of the Group la discharge increases in proportion to muscle extension, therefore the contraction curve of the intrafusal muscle fiber is measured from augmentation of the discharge frequency. Contraction of the intrafusal muscle fibers lasts for several hundred msec, and the curve has two peaks at about 60 msec, and 110 (Fig. 5). It is clear then that the former corresponds to contraction of the nuclear-bag fiber, and the latter to contraction of the nuclearchain fiber...|$|R

Data analysis allowed the clarification {{of the structure of the}} crystalline phases and their transformations during the aging. In both oriented samples similar structural changes were observed, although they were due to different aging mechanisms. The physical aging led to the crystallization in both samples of an oriented helical form, due to a partial transformation of the mesophase and of the amorphous phase. In the oriented sample aged with fixed ends, a small fraction of the crystalline trans-planar form III became stable even by releasing the tension after 1 year. This last sample did not undergo the large shrinkage, always observed by unloaded sPP after drawing, and therefore was no more elastic. Also, the sample aged with free ends for 1 year showed a reduced elasticity in terms of both dissipated energy and permanent set.

However, on returning to normal Ringer the fibers' ability to twitch or to develop potassium contractures was lost. The return of the fibers to normal Ringer after exposure to these hypertonic solutions causes a transient swelling of the fibers.

40|$|An {{effect of}} {{internal}} citrate ions on excitation-contraction coupling in skeletal muscle is described. The threshold for contraction {{was measured in}} rat extensor digitorum longus, (EDL), and soleus muscle fibers using a two microelectrode voltage clamp technique with either KCl-filled or K 3 citrate-filled current electrodes. Contraction thresholds were stable for many minutes with KCl current electrodes. In contrast, thresholds fell progressively towards the resting membrane potential, {{by as much as}} - 15 mV over a period of 10 to 20 min of voltage-clamp with citrate current electrodes. In addition, prepulse inhibition was suppressed, subthreshold activation enhanced and steady-state inactivation shifted to more negative potentials. <b>Fibers</b> <b>recovered</b> slowly from these effects when the citrate electrode was withdrawn and replaced with a KCl electrode. The changes in contraction threshold suggest that citrate ions act on the muscle activation system at an intracellular site, since the citrate permeability of the surface membrane is probably very low. An internal citrate concentration of 5 mM was calculated to result from citrate diffusion out of the microelectrode into the recording area for 20 min. 5 mM citrate added to an artificial cell lowered the free calcium concentration from 240 to 31 microM.

This paper presents part of this research and examines initially an existing design guideline, developed by RILEM for steel fiber-reinforced concrete (SFRC), {{in order to assess}} the suitability of the guideline for the flexural design of concrete reinforced with RSF (RSFRC). This examination indicates that, although the RILEM guideline is in general suitable for the flexural design of RSFRC, there are some fundamental issues related to the evaluation of the tensile stress-strain behavior of SFRC that affect the accuracy of the guideline. Thus, based on this conclusion, a new approach is outlined for the evaluation of the tensile stress - strain behavior of SFRC and models are derived for different types of RSF and industrially produced fibers. These models are applied to the flexural design of concrete reinforced with RSF (RSFRC) and results are compared with those obtained by using the RILEM tensile stress-strain models. It is concluded that the model proposed in this study is more conservative and accurate than the RILEM models.

The {{objective of this}} research is to investigate whether the use of new coatings (micro or nano TiO 2) and different pulp types could bring savings in wood, energy, GHG emissions and other environmental impacts in comparison with conventional printing and writing paper. We studied three types of pulp, namely i) unbleached virgin kraft pulp, ii) <b>recovered</b> <b>fiber,</b> and iii) high yield virgin chemithermo-mechanical pulp (CTMP). A life cycle assessment (LCA) was conducted from cradle to grave. Applying attributional modeling, we found that wood savings amount to 60 % for the nanoparticle coated <b>recovered</b> <b>fiber</b> paper and 35 % for the micro TiO 2 coated CTMP paper. According to the ReCiPe single score impact assessment method, the new product configurations allow the reduction of the environmental impacts by 10 – 35 % compared to conventional kraft paper. Applying consequential modeling,we found larger energy and GHG emission savings compared to attributional modeling because the saved wood is used for producing energy, thereby replacing fossil fuels. The nanoparticle coated <b>recovered</b> <b>fiber</b> paper offered savings of non-renewable energy use (NREU) by 100 % (13 GJ/ton paper) and GHG emission reduction by 75 % (0. 6 ton CO 2 eq. /ton paper).

Moreover, as a case study, a fracture-based plasticity formulation for simulating the overall pull-out behavior of fibers embedded in cementitious matrices is also employed. This formulation is based on assuming a discontinuous response between interface bond stresses and the corresponding relative displacements. Then, an extensive comparison between numerical predictions and the corresponding experimental results of the pullout behavior of recycled steel fibers embedded in concrete is presented for validating and calibrating the model. A satisfactory agreement was observed between the numerical and experimental results: it demonstrates the soundness of the interface formulation. Fil: Caggiano, Antonio. Universidad de Buenos Aires.

40|$|Abstract—All-optical clock {{recovery}} is demonstrated from pseudo-data patterns at 30 Gb/s. The circuit {{is based on}} the optical gain modulation of a semiconductor optical amplifier <b>fiber</b> laser. The <b>recovered</b> clock is a 2. 7 -ps pulse train, with very low modulation pattern even in the presence of more than 200 consecutive 0 ’s in the data signal. Index Terms—All optical, {{clock recovery}}, ring laser, semicon-ductor optical amplifier. I...|$|R
40|$|The use {{of carbon}} fiber {{reinforced}} thermoset composites {{has doubled in}} the last decade raising questions about the waste generated from manufacturing and at end-of-life, especially in the aircraft industry. In this study, 2. 5 cm long carbon <b>fibers</b> were <b>recovered</b> from thermoset composite waste using a commercial scale pyrolysis process. Scanning electron microscopy, density measurements, single filament tensile testing as well as micro-droplet testing were performed to characterize the morphology, mechanical properties, and surface adhesion of the fibers. The recycled fibers appeared to be mostly undamaged and clean, exhibiting comparable mechanical properties to virgin carbon fibers. A carding process followed by an ultrasound treatment produced randomly aligned recycled fiber mats. These mats were used to fabricate composite plates, with fiber volume fractions up to 40...|$|R
