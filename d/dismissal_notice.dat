40|$|Replaçant la procédure d'injonction dans son contexte sociologique en se référant aux caractéristiques essentielles du droit du travail, l'auteur préconise le rapatriement d'une procédure d'injonction modifiée dans la législation du travail et analyse les nouveaux pouvoirs accordés au Conseil canadien des {{relations}} du travail (CCRT) en matière d'ordre de ne pas faire (cease and desist order). In our days, {{the industrial}} relations field is yet unexplored. It {{would be quite}} an incomplete view to examine the injunction in its judicial context ; it is adequate to re-situate it in its sociological context. It is important to question {{the impact of the}} sociology of labour regarding the evolution of labour laws The free collective bargaining System imposes itself more and more on our occidental democracies as being the rule and the instrument able to assure industrial peace; it is important to rightly recognize its requirements. The face to face pattern, the « rapport de force », and the conflict are the basic elements of the regime. The protection and the promotion of Freedom of Association, which tends to encourage and privilege collective bargaining, is the cornerstone of this System. Furthermore, labour laws are essentially established {{for the protection of the}} workers; this characteristic is largely recognized and implemented. But, there is also a certain particularism attached to labour laws to such an extent that they tend to dissociate from the civil law, and to set up in an independent judicial System. The main reason for this tendency towards autonomy lies in the incompatibility of nature between the two disciplines. For example, notions like the absolute authority of employer regarding dismissals, the civilist theory on risk, the <b>dismissal</b> <b>notice</b> period, the rupture or resiliation of lease of personal service contract, have totally contradictory connotations or applications, as long as you consider them in the civil code perspective, or in the scope of the collective bargaining System. Considering the injunction procedure in the global context of the collective bargaining System, where the right to strike is sanctioned by the law as a « corollaire » of the right to collective bargaining, it is quite easy to realize that the injunction looks like an anachronism, a « cataplasme » artificially imposed and attacking the intergrity of the System. Instead of encouraging or promoting the collective bargaining System, the injunction has the very direct effect of undermining the System itself. Showing the way, and suggesting some guidelines for the future, the author recommends that priority be given to the particularism of labour laws regarding civil law, common law, or criminal law. By doing so, one might contribute to the de-mystification, the de-dramatization or the de-criminalization of the strikes phenomenon. It would be advisable to replace the injunction with an alternative formula. The last amendments recently applied, to the Canada Labour Code, (June, 1978), give new powers to the Canada Labour Relations Board in matters related to illegal strikes, and suggest a new approach. Therefore, at the request of an interested party, the Board, after an investigation, may issue a declaration of illegal strike or lock-out, or an order of « statu quo ante ». But these quasi-judicial decisions may be preceded by an investigation and by mediation efforts, in an attempt to settle the conflicts. The new powers grant considerable pressures and effective means of dissuasion to the C. L. R. B. A judgment of the Supreme Court of Canada, involving a construction union and the Nova Scotia Labour Board reflects this issue. The court established the distinction between the traditional injunction procedure and the new powers given the labour boards. In addition to this, the constitutional aspect concerning the competence of a labour board to issue cease and desist orders was equally decided...|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} the study was to conduct an {{analysis}} of due process held by selected Indiana secondary school principals. Specifically, the study was to provide an overview of the following: 1. The current status of secondary school principals in regard to due process. 2. The desired status of secondary school principals in regard to due process. 3. The procedures necessary for secondary school principals to obtain due process. Data for the study were obtained through a survey questionnaire which was developed and mailed to 100 randomly selected Indiana secondary school principals. Information for the questionnaire was obtained through the study of instruments reared by professional associations, a review of literature, and known concerns of a select panel of secondary school principals. The information was then embodied into the 31 item questionnaire. Ninety-two useable questionnaires were received and used in the study. Major findings of the study were: 1. Forty-three principals were contracted for one year while sixteen principals held three year contracts. 2. Thirty-four principals reported that notification or renewal or non-renewal of contracts was received on or before April 30 th. 3. Fifty-five principals indicated they did not administer under a written job description. 4. While 25 principals indicated a written evaluation of their job was received, 57 principals indicated the evaluation of performance was verbal or non-existent. 5. Thirteen of the principals indicated the non-renewal of a contract had been experienced and twelve of the thirteen indicated a school board hearing was not granted, an opportunity to defend decision was not given, nor were written reasons for the non-renewal of the contract received by the principal. Major conclusions of the study were: Current Due Process 1. The Indiana secondary school principal lacks statutory recognition that provides for early notice of the renewal or non-renewal of contract. 2. The majority of the principals lack a written job description and two thirds were not involved in the development of the job description. 3. The majority of the principals are not involved in the development of the evaluation instrument. 4. The principals usually are not given a hearing nor an opportunity to defend administrative decisions when faced with non-renewal of the contract. 5. Principals are usually dismissed without receiving the reasons in writing. Desired Due Process 1. Indiana secondary school principals solidly indicated that the most important requirement for due process is sound personnel procedures to channel complaints and the right to provide a fair response. 2. Indiana secondary school principals want the right of early notification when faced with the non-renewal of the contract. 3. The principals want the opportunity to a fair and impartial hearing before the school board prior to receiving a <b>dismissal</b> <b>notice.</b> 4. Principals want the right to be furnished with written, documented charges when faced with dismissal. The following recommendations are based upon the evidence established by research findings and conclusions in this study:The Indiana secondary school principal: 1. Should belong to the Indiana Association of Junior and Senior High School Principals for professional support in the position. 2. Should initiate and support strong legislation which will aid in establishing the entity of the principal and provide a legal basis for clearly marking out the bounds of principal rights and responsibilities and asserting his authority. 3. Should be involved in developing a written job description of performance objectives and criteria which will provide a more objective and less subjective review of the work of the principal. 4. Should be given a yearly evaluation in writing based upon a professional evaluation instrument. 5. Should be given early notice based on Indiana principal law when faced with the non-renewal of a contract. 6. Should be given the opportunity for a fair and impartial hearing before the school board to defend administrative decisions when faced with the non-renewal of a contract. 7. Should be given written, documented reasons, non-arbitrary and non-capricious, when faced with the non-renewal of a contract. 8.

40|$|The legal {{relationship}} between civil servants and the state, is not {{governed by the}} theory of sovereignty, which is relevant in the outer relationships {{between the state and}} its citizens, though it has some, limited effect on the inner relationships between the civil servant and the state organ, as well. The inner relationship falls into the category of "dependent work" and therefore civil servants must enjoy the employment rights generally applicable to employees with some alterations. Among such rights, two are investigated more closely in the paper: protection against unjust dismissal and collective rights of workers (right to organise, right to bargain collectively, and right to strike). In 2010 the Hungarian state modified its regulations on civil servants and introduced <b>dismissal</b> without <b>notice</b> referring to the argument that the parties of the {{legal relationship}} must be treated equally and because the civil servant can resign from its position without notice, the same right should be enjoyed by the state, as well. The Hungarian Constitutional Court and European Court of Justice nullified this law because of violating the right to work, the right to human dignity, and the right to hold public positions. The regulations on collective rights of civil servants have been systematically violated by the Hungarian legislator since 1992, when the first regulation on civil servants passed. Until 2011 the right to organise has been enjoyed without disturbance by civil servants but since than the state has organise the Bar of Hungarian Civil Servants into which all civil servants are obliged to enter. Because the Bar has rights which are usually considered to be union rights, therefore the Bar is a competitor of the civil servants' unions; consequently the regulations on the Bar violate the right to organise. The right to bargain collectively has never been enjoyed by unions of civil servants since 1992, despite such right is generally applied in developed countries app. since 1960 - 1970 s and is also accepted by the international conventions on social and economic rights. The right to strike is also restricted by the Agreement on Right to Strike in Civil Service (1994) which prohibits the rights to strike far beyond the limits established by the Fundamental Law and the Act on Right to Strike (Act No. VII of 1989). Alternative methods of collective dispute settlement (mediation, arbitration) are also neglected by the Hungarian legal regime...|$|R
25|$|Even {{with the}} UK's non-frustration {{principle}} directors always {{still have the}} option to persuade their shareholders through informed and reasoned argument that the share price offer is too low, or that the bidder may have ulterior motives that are bad for the company's employees, or for its ethical image. Under common law and the Takeover Code, directors must give out information to shareholders relevant to the bid, but not merely recommend the highest offer. The overriding common law rule, however, is to avoid any possibility of a conflict of interest, which precludes using management powers for the purpose of frustrating takeovers. In Hogg v Cramphorn Ltd the director, purportedly concerned that a takeover bidder would make many workers redundant, issued a block of company shares to a trust, thus ensuring the bidder would remain outvoted. Buckley J held the power to issue shares creates fiduciary duty to only do so for the purpose of raising capital. Directors cannot plead they acted in good faith if a court determines their interests may possibly conflict. The result is that even though directors may wish to protect employees and stakeholders from ominous bidders, the law responds in other ways. UK workers have a minimal measure of job security, with very limited rights to be consulted, and no formal rights outside collective bargaining to participate in elections for the board or codetermine dismissal issues in works councils. Employees do have rights before dismissal or redundancies to reasonable <b>notice,</b> <b>dismissal</b> only for a fair reason, and a redundancy payment, under the Employment Rights Act 1996. Moreover, any changes to workers terms and conditions, or redundancies, following a restructuring through an asset (as opposed to share) sale triggers protection of the Transfer of Undertakings (Protection of Employment) Regulations 2006 meaning good economic, technical or organisational reasons must be given.|$|R
5000|$|Born in Coventry, {{he grew up}} in Wyken, {{a suburb}} {{dominated}} by Morris Motors, where his father was a machine-setter. (The district was often a target in the Coventry Blitz of 1940-41.) At King Henry VIII School, he responded to the maverick style of headmaster A. A. C. Burton, but not to his conventional successor, H.Walker. He trained as a reporter on The Coventry Standard, under the painstakingly prosaic editorship of Edgar Letts, who was prone to ask of Shaw's copy, [...] "Is this true?". He then studied at The University of Leeds, supplementing his grant with work as a correspondent for the Manchester office of Melody Maker and as a freelance for the Yorkshire Evening Post. His honours degree included a [...] "first" [...] in English Literature. (Among his tutors was the much admired scholar G. Wilson Knight,whose tutorial speculations tended to centre on his spiritualist experiences. Another focus of literary interest was the Professor of English, Bonamy Dobree, regarded by many literary critics as the original of Professor Welch in Lucky Jim.) Shaw's two years as a conscript in the Army included periods at the Joint Services School for Linguists run by the Services' Intelligence arm, and, briefly, the Royal Military Academy Sandhurst, on posting from which he reverted to private. His final year's service - at the Cavalry Barracks, York - was marked by offences [...] "against military order and good discipline". For some years he then taught English in schools and adult education for the Workers' Educational Association. From 1964 to 1968 he combined being Head of English and Sixth Form at the Leeds Modern School, with a part-time Tutorship at Leeds University and a Visiting Fellowship at The University of York. From 1968 to 1972 he was Lecturer at The University of Southampton. In 1972 he became a freelance, returning to Yorkshire, to the Pennine village of Haworth where his wife, the studio-potter Anne Shaw, had set up Haworth Pottery. He toured Britain, from the Isle of Wight to Pitlochry, giving [...] "readings" [...] of his poems, sometimes with jazz. Sponsors included W H Smith, The Arts Council of Great Britain, Boots UK, and The Department of Education. He also reviewed, wrote for television and radio, contributed literary criticism and edited The Yorkshire Review for the regional arts association. The magazine was reviewed by Robert Nye in The Times as [...] "distinguished" [...] with [...] "an attractive catholicity". As editor he published many lesser known and previously unpublished writers as well as major figures like Stan Barstow, Barry Hines, Henry Livings, Norman MacCaig, James Kirkup and Douglas Dunn.

3000|$|The {{construction}} of the EPL gap for each country in our sample {{is based on the}} following two pieces of information. On the one hand, OECD (2013) provides a detailed account of EPL rules for permanent contracts in OECD countries during 2012 – 2013. There are 21 items for each country summarizing severance pay, notice periods, rules for fair/unfair and for personal/collective dismissals, etc.; these items become inputs {{in the design of the}} well-known EPL categorical indicators which have been widely used in the literature (see, e.g., Boeri et al. 2017, for an overview). In particular, we choose item 7 where OECD provides a representative/average calculation in terms of monthly wages of “compensation following unfair dismissal of a worker under a permanent contracts with 20 years of tenure”. Following our benchmark comparison of the redundancy costs for a firm which lays off a worker with a permanent contract after 4 years of tenure against hiring four workers in sequence under one-year long temporary contracts, the corresponding figure in item 7 is divided by 5. Column [2] in Table 6 gathers the severance pay for permanent contracts in each country. On the other hand, regarding EPL for temporary contracts, we use information from OECD (2014, Table 4.4), which provides detailed descriptions of difficulty of <b>dismissals,</b> severance and <b>notice</b> period, procedural inconveniences, etc. Specifically we choose the item “notice and severance at end date of contract”, expressed in monthly wages per year of service and multiplied it by 4. In some cases there is no compensation or it is the same as for temporary contracts. Column [3] in Table 6 gathers this temporary contracts non-renewal compensation cost. Finally, column [4] reports the EPL gap. As can be seen, gaps range from about three monthly wages in Spain to zero in Ireland and the UK. If we were interested in the EPL gap at tenure d [...] 4 then the figures reported in column [3] should be multiplied by d /  4. Finally, columns [5]–[9] presents country-specific weighted averages of the variables of interest in this study (share of temporary contracts, training and test scores).|$|R
40|$|Dans cet article, les auteurs se proposent de {{comparer}} la législation québécoise en matière de préavis de licenciement collectif, tant dans ses dispositions que dans son application, aux caractéristiques idéales que devrait revêtir une telle procédure dans le cadre d'une politique active et positive des services de main-d'oeuvre. It is now largely {{recognized that}} preventive measures {{are not only}} useful but necessary to workers' adjustment in cases of mass layoffs. In terms of a genuine policy of manpower services, this is to mean that measures of assistance (essential functions such as intervention over demand for labor, supply of labor and matching) must be efficiently supported by prerequisite functions such as prevention and information. It is within these prerequisite functions that the advance notice of mass layoff may be classified. The province of Québec is the first and sole North American jurisdiction to have included in a law (The Manpower Vocational Training and Qualification Act of 1969) a public compulsory adjustment program for the redundant officially aiming in accordance with ILO recommendation No 119, at finding satisfactory reemployment to redundant workers as soon as possible. The {{purpose of this study}} is to compare Québec advance notice measures (art. 45 a) of Québec's Manpower Vocational Training and Qualification Act) to the "ideal" characteristics such a measure should have within the framework of a genuine policy of manpower services. This paper includes two sections. First, an effort is made to establish from the Canadian, American, French, and English literature what are the characteristics of the "ideal" advance notice of mass layoff. Secondly, following a brief presentation of Québec's advance notice approach, a comparison is made between Québec's experience and what has been established as the "ideal" advance notice. In fact, this comparison is made in two stages: it first focuses on the content of the legislation and, secondly, on the practical application of this measure. For the empirical part of this paper, two different sources of data are used. First, a questionnaire was administered to the advance notices on file at the Québec Department of Labor and Manpower. This first exercice was limited to a sample of 137 different cases (N= 548) of mass layoff which had taken place between August 2 1969 and June 30 1974. Secondly, reference is sometimes made to relevant data collected from 380 redundant blue-collar workers for an evaluative research of the Québec reclassification program in cases of plant shutdowns and whose results have already been published. IDÉAL CHARACTERISTICS OF THE ADVANCE NOTICE OF MASS LAYOFFEventhough the principle of advance notice is largely accepted, differences may exist as to the practical application of this principle. Let us very briefly summarize what experience teaches and that at four different levels: the recipient, the delay, the content and the strategy of the advance notice. a) The recipient of the advance notice: the advance notice should be sent to all workers that will or could be made redundant, to workers representatives and to public manpower authorities. b) The delay of the advance notice: the advance notice should be given as soon as possible ; a minimum compulsory delay of at least two months and payments in lieu of advance notice should be determined by law. c) The content of the advance notice : the advance notice should indicate the date of the layoff, its reasons, its modalities, the action intended to help workers, the length of the layoff if it is to be temporary, the rights and privileges of concerned workers and the list of affected employeesd) The strategy of the advance notice: the advance notice should be sent by official, letter simultaneously to all individuals and organizations concerned. THE QUE'BEC APPROACHBasically, the Québec advance notice legislation requires any employer (except in the case of undertakings of seasonnal or intermittent nature) who, for technological or economic reasons foresees having to make a collective <b>dismissal,</b> to give <b>notice</b> to the Minister of Labor and Manpower within specific delays whose length varies with the number of workers to be laid off: two months if 10 to 99 workers are to be made redundant, three months if the number of employees affected is between 100 and 299, and four months if the layoff is to touch 300 workers or more. Moreover, the specifies of this advance notice is not presented in the law itself but in the Order in Council No 717 of March 7, 1970. Comparing the content of the law and order in council No 717 to the "ideal" characteristics of the advance note, the following shortcomings may be noted: 1 - The employer is not forced to send the advance notice to the individual workers concerned. 2 - The advance notice applies only to cases where at least ten workers are affected. 3 - The scope of the law establishing the advance notice is determined by Order in council 717. This is contrary to usual legislative procedure and may bring the regulation 717 to be ruled "ultra vires". 4 - Payment in lieu of advance notice is not required in the Québec law. 5 - Severance pay is absent from the Québec law. EMPIRICAL OBSERVATIONSFrom the data collected for this paper, the following observations were made: 1 - About 1 / 3 of all cases included in the sample did not contain the advance notice to the minister as the law requires. 2 - The advance notice was more often given by employers whose workers are unionized (69. 6 %) than by employers with no union (56. 5 %) 3 - The advance notice is more present in cases of complete permanent layoffs than in cases of partial permanent layoff. 4 - A statistically significant relationships was observed between the presence of the public compulsory advance notice and the presence of a private advance notice included in the collective agreement. 5 - In only 76. 1 % of the cases studied did the employers respect the advance notice delays imposes by law. 6 - As to the content of the advance notice, only 26. 8 % of the cases studied containedall the information required by regulation 717. Moreover one must note that the most often missing information is the list of workers to be made redundant. This information was given in only 34. 4 % of the cases studied. 7 - Most workers having received an advance notice of mass layoff have received it orally (63. 5 %). 8 - In the Québec approach, the sole official reason for the existence of an advance notice is to trigger the reclassification program. This did so in 70 of the 137 cases studied. Moreover, when the notice is given, there is a high significant positive relation-ship between the presence of the notice and the existence of a reclassification committee. CONCLUSIONThe observed shortcomings of the law and of regulation 717 and the weaknesses derived from the empirical data collected for this study may seriously delay and even make inefficient the actual advance notice procedure within the ideal frame-work of an active and positive search for solutions to problems of reemployment in cases of mass layoff. Eventhough the Québec approach is a significant first step, it remains partial and does not sufficiently take into account the individuals' problems in a redundancy. The time may have come to systematically examine this seven year experience of advance notice and to build a genuine redundancy legislation that would include the ideal characteristics of advance notice and that would be thought in accordance with recommendation 119 of the I.
