40|$|Pyrite (FeS 2) is {{a mineral}} phase often present as {{inclusions}} in temperate soils. Moreover, {{it turns out}} to be a sorption sink for certain radionuclides in deep <b>geological</b> <b>disposals.</b> The present study was thus initiated to determine the capacity of pyrite to immobilize selenide (Se(-II)). Due to the fact that pyrite surface oxidizes readily, potentials were applied in order to minimise its surface evolution, and ensure the reducing conditions necessary for stabilizing Se(-II). The sorption experiments were carried out in NaCl electrolyte and were amperometrically controlled. After only several minutes of reaction, at least 97 % of Se(-II) initially present in solution was disappeared. The Kd values vary from 7 – 65 L/g and the isotherm curve shows site saturation at higher initial selenide concentrations and no pH-dependence. By means of several spectroscopic techniques, the reaction mechanism was investigated. The XRD and in situ XANES results indicate the presence of Se(0) on pyrite surface, which explain the rapid disappearance of Se observed in the sorption experiments. Moreover, XPS results obtained from Se-reacted pyrite particles reveal cleavage of S–S bonding which resulted in formation of S 2 − on pyrite surface. Thus, we conclude that Se(-II) can be immobilized by pyrite via surface redox reaction: ≡FeS 2 + HSe− ⇔ ≡FeS + Se(0) + HS−...|$|R

In a context of storage in deep geological formations or after their release in terrestrial environnements by accidents, it is of paramount importance to quantify their mobility, which is partly ruled by their interaction with the solid surfaces. Usually, experiments are conducted using radiotracers at various scale from laboratory to the field in order to measure retention and retardation parameters. Although this kind of experiment is fundamental to tackle this issue, understanding the natural speciation of stable isotopes as chemical homologues to RN brings useful additional information. In particular, it sheds light on RN isotopic exchange and "irreversible" trapping mechanisms. This approach has already been used successfully to gain a better comprehension of iodine fate in the far-field of <b>geological</b> <b>disposals</b> (Claret et al., 2010), which was debated in the litterature, due to conflicting experimental results (from no retardation to significant retardation, depending on the study).

40|$|The Rupelian clay in the Netherlands is {{currently}} {{the subject of a}} feasibility study with respect to the storage of radioactive waste in the Netherlands (OPERA-project). Many features need to be considered in the assessment of the long-term evolution of the natural environment surrounding a <b>geological</b> waste <b>disposal</b> facility. One of these is permafrost development as it may have an impact on various components of the disposal system, including the natural environment (hydrogeology), the natural barrier (clay) and the engineered barrier. Determining how deep permafrost might develop in the future is desirable in order to properly address the possible impact on the various components. It is expected that periglacial conditions will reappear {{at some point during the}} next several hundred thousands of years, a typical time frame considered in <b>geological</b> waste <b>disposal</b> feasibility studies. In this study, the Weichselian glaciation is used as an analogue for future permafrost development. Permafrost depth modelling using a best estimate temperature curve of the Weichselian indicates that permafrost would reach depths between 155 and 195  m. Without imposing a climatic gradient over the country, deepest permafrost is expected in the south due to the lower geothermal heat flux and higher average sand content of the post-Rupelian overburden. Accounting for various sources of uncertainty, such as type and impact of vegetation, snow cover, surface temperature gradients across the country, possible errors in palaeoclimate reconstructions, porosity, lithology and geothermal heat flux, stochastic calculations point out that permafrost depth during the coldest stages of a glacial cycle such as the Weichselian, for any location in the Netherlands, would be 130 – 210  m at the 2 σ level. In any case, permafrost would not reach depths greater than 270  m. The most sensitive parameters in permafrost development are the mean annual air temperatures and porosity, while the geothermal heat flux is the crucial parameter in permafrost degradation once temperatures start rising again...|$|R

25|$|Asphalt {{was used}} {{starting}} in the 1960s as an hydrophobic matrix aiming to encapsulate radioactive waste such as medium-activity salts (mainly soluble sodium nitrate and sodium sulfate) produced by the reprocessing of spent nuclear fuels or radioactive sludges from sedimentation ponds. Bituminised radioactive waste containing highly radiotoxic alpha-emitting transuranic elements from nuclear reprocessing plants have been produced at industrial scale in France, Belgium and Japan, but this type of waste conditioning has been abandoned because operational safety issues (risks of fire, as occurred in a bituminisation plant at Tokai Works in Japan) and long-term stability problems related to their <b>geological</b> <b>disposal</b> in deep rock formations. One of the main problem is the swelling of asphalt exposed to radiation and to water. Asphalt swelling is first induced by radiation {{because of the presence}} of hydrogen gas bubbles generated by alpha and gamma radiolysis. A second mechanism is the matrix swelling when the encapsulated hygroscopic salts exposed to water or moisture start to rehydrate and to dissolve. The high concentration of salt in the pore solution inside the bituminised matrix is then responsible for osmotic effects inside the bituminised matrix. The water moves in the direction of the concentrated salts, the asphalt acting as a semi-permeable membrane. This also causes the matrix to swell. The swelling pressure due to osmotic effect under constant volume can be as high as 200 bar. If not properly managed, this high pressure can cause fractures in the near field of a disposal gallery of bituminised medium-level waste. When the bituminised matrix has been altered by swelling, encapsulated radionuclides are easily leached by the contact of ground water and released in the geosphere. The high ionic strength of the concentrated saline solution also favours the migration of radionuclides in clay host rocks. The presence of chemically reactive nitrate can also affect the redox conditions prevailing in the host rock by establishing oxidizing conditions, preventing the reduction of redox-sensitive radionuclides. Under their higher valences, radionuclides of elements such as selenium, technetium, uranium, neptunium and plutonium have an higher solubility and are also often present in water as non-retarded anions. This makes the disposal of medium-level bituminised waste very challenging.|$|E
30|$|Bentonite is {{identified}} as potential buffer material in deep <b>geological</b> repositories for <b>disposal</b> of high level radioactive wastes (HLW) owing to its very low hydraulic conductivity, large swelling ability and high adsorptive capacity to retain cations (Pusch 2008).

For investigation of pressure and suction effects on the thermal volumetric behavior of the highly compacted GMZ 01 Bent, a new suction-temperature controlled oedometer was developed. Several suction and pressure controlled cyclic heating and cooling tests have been performed on highly compacted GMZ 01 Bent. Suctions ranging from 4 to 110. MPa, temperatures from 25 to 80. °C and vertical loads from 0. 1 to 5. MPa were applied. Results show that heating at constant suction and pressure induces either swelling or contraction. At high pressure and low suction, heating tends to induce contraction, while at low pressure and high suction, heating induces expansion. Thermal volumetric strain of GMZ 01 Bent tested strongly depends on the overconsolidation ratio (OCR).

40|$|The <b>geological</b> deep <b>disposal</b> of Nuclear High Level Waste (HLW) is {{nowadays}} {{considered the}} most likely option {{to solve the problem}} of nuclear waste in the long term. In most of the countries that have developed nuclear civil programs, three options are considered as potential geological formations to host a repository: Granite, clay and salt, though other alternatives are not excluded. One of the requirements to get the approval from national authorities to operate such kind of facility is the demonstration of compliance with national regulations regarding post-closure safety. Post-closure safety criteria are based on the concept of risk in many countries, and the peak of the mean dose over time is the most widely used measure of risk. Uncertainty is a pervasive factor all over this process. We have to face model uncertainty, scenario uncertainty and parameter uncertainty. Not all our models are validated under all possible physical conditions and in some cases we could be omitting some relevant phenomena. Regarding scenarios, omitting some relevant scenario could be possible and estimating scenario probabilities is not an easy task. Finally, parameter uncertainty is a main issue, mostly when the origin of uncertainty is lack of knowledge instead of intrinsic variability. A trustworthy risk assessment should rely on an accurate assessment of all kinds of uncertainties. In this paper we address the issue of risk dilution in the risk assessment of a HLW repository. Risk dilution consists in getting a lower estimation of risk (peak of the mean dose over time), due to either wrong assessment of input parameter uncertain, or to inadequate treatment of events that could have a high impact on the dose but whose occurrence is stochastic and has a very limited action in time and/or space. The origin of this phenomenon is analysed in this work, its potential negative effects on a risk assessment and possible ways of dealing with it. JRC. F. 4 -Nuclear design safet...|$|R

The United States Academy of Sciences (NAS) has recommended that these surplus fissile materials (SFMs) be processed so they are no more accessible than plutonium in spent nuclear fuel (SNF).

The NAS recommended investigation of three sets of options for disposition of SFMs while meeting the spent fuel standard: (1) incorporate SFMs with highly radioactive materials and dispose of as waste, (2) partly burn the SFMs in reactors with conversion of the SFMs to SNF for disposal, and (3) dispose of the SFMs in deep boreholes.
