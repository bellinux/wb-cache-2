40|$|Organic {{farming is}} practiced in over 100 {{countries}} {{on more than}} 26 million hectares. In the European Union (EU 25), about 5. 6 million hectares of farm land are certified under the EU organic farming regulation 2092 / 91 /EEC. Since 1992, these figures have been increased six times.

40|$|AbstractCurrent {{practices}} in <b>intensive</b> <b>animal</b> production increasingly raise questions {{with respect to}} animal ethics both among the public in Europe and in political circles. This paper integrates three areas of philosophical views in order to formulate a general ethical position with respect to <b>animal</b> <b>husbandry.</b> The first area regards the question to what type of beings animals are. Secondly, an evaluative model of agrarian practices is employed {{in order to obtain}} a better perception on the place of <b>animals</b> in <b>animal</b> <b>husbandry.</b> In these two lines of thinking, reformational philosophy from the school of Dooyeweerd is explicitly employed. In the third view, current thinking regarding normative ethics, in general, and animal ethics, in particular, is utilized to elaborate on the ethical aspect of the practice of <b>animal</b> <b>husbandry.</b> It is argued that the major ethical principles for evaluating the manner in which animals are cared for and treated in <b>animal</b> <b>husbandry</b> are the concepts of the ‘intrinsic value’ of animals, animal welfare, and the principle of care, the latter being the core principle of the ethical aspect. On the basis of the literature, these three concepts are elaborated consistent with reformational philosophy.

Pollutant generation coefficients were average level of major pollutants in livestock and poultry manure, which were more precise at the macro level and were used to predict the amount of pollutants. There were three predic-tion model systems discussed. First, prediction models based on composition of dietary were less accurate than others but were more useful for farms where could get the basic data of the diet to predict rapidly the concentrations of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus of manure for the treatment and utilization of manure. Second, prediction models based on physical and chemical properties of manure were more precise than the first one, which could provide scientific basis for developing instruments determined concentrations of organic matter, nitrogen and phosphorus rapidly. Third, prediction models based on near-infrared spectrum analysis were the most accurate. Those models were likely to finish the on-line analysis of concentrations of organic matter, nitrogen, phosphorus of livestock and poultry manure in the laboratory.

Lodi province is characterized by <b>intensive</b> agriculture, notably <b>animal</b> <b>husbandry.</b> This paper assesses indoor levels of selected airborne pollutants in 60 homes in the province, with special attention to size-fractionated particulate matter (PM). Indoor PM 2. 5 concentrations are frequently higher than current guidelines. PM 10 and nitrogen dioxide also exceed the respective guideline recommendations in some cases, noting that 24 -h nitrogen dioxide levels were compared with an annual limit value. All other studied pollutant levels are below current international guidelines. Among indoor PM size fractions, PM 0. 5 is predominant in terms of mass concentrations corresponding to 57 % of PM 10 in summer and 71 % in winter. A strong seasonal trend is observed for all studied pollutants, with higher levels in winter corresponding to changes in ambient concentrations. The seasonal variation in PM 10 {{is largely due to}} PM 0. 5 increase from summer to winter.

Although in many countries emphasis is put on reduction of environmental pollution by nutrients, ammonia emission and odour nuisance, reduction of the emission of greenhouse gases will become equally important {{in the near future}} to meet integrated sustainability criteria (1997 Kyoto protocol). Emissions of greenhouse gases differ in origin. Methane from <b>animal</b> <b>husbandry</b> is for a large part endogenous, and may be hard to reduce in <b>intensive</b> <b>animal</b> production. Methane emission reduction strategies should focus on its use as fuel or preventing its formation, mainly during on-farm storage (indoor, outside) or treatment through control of critical processes (degradation of organic matter) and critical factors (e. g., temperature). Nitrous oxide is mainly produced during the aerobic storage and treatment of animal excreta, as well as after land spreading.
