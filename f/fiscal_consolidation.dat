5|$|A second {{important}} {{factor is the}} success of the IMF Stand-By-Arrangement in the country since November 2008. The SBA includes three pillars. The first pillar is a program of medium term <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidation,</b> involving painful austerity measures and significant tax hikes. The result has been that central government debts have been stabilised at around 80–90 percent of GDP. A second pillar is the resurrection of a viable but sharply downsized domestic banking system on the ruins of its gargantuan international banking system which the government was unable to bail out. A third pillar is the enactment of capital controls and the work to gradually lift these to restore normal financial linkages with the outside world. An important result of the emergency legislation and the SBA is that the country has not been seriously affected by the European sovereign debt crisis from 2010. Despite a contentious debate with Britain and the Netherlands over the question of a state guarantee on the Icesave deposits of Landsbanki in these countries, credit default swaps on Icelandic sovereign debt have steadily declined from over 1000 points prior to the crash in 2008 to around 200 points in June 2011. The fact that the assets of the failed Landsbanki branches are now estimated to cover most of the depositor claims has had an influence to ease concerns over the situation.|$|E

Both of these latter findings indicate that deterioration in household balance sheets are important to understand private debt-dependent effects of austerity.

These adverse effects are mitigated substantially if consolidations are large, and can be avoided if consolidations are also accompanied with more adaptable macroeconomic policies and implemented by a stable government.

40|$|The {{success of}} a {{consolidation}} in reducing the debt ratio depends crucially {{on the value of}} the multiplier, which measures the impact of consolidation on growth, and on the reaction of sovereign yields to such a consolidation.

We also assess the role of markets confidence to <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidations</b> under al ternative scenarios. We find that with high levels of public debt and sizeable fiscal multipliers, debt ratios are likely to increase in the short term in response to <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidations.</b> Hence, the typical horizon for a consolidation during crises episo des to reduce the debt ratio is two - three years, although this horizon depends critically on the size and persistence of fiscal multipliers and the reaction of financial markets.

The consolidations {{that turned out to be}} expansionary were in general based on expenditure cuts rather than on revenue increases. Simulations with the QUEST model show that expansionary effects from <b>fiscal</b> <b>consolidations</b> can emerge in the short/medium run provided that consolidations are expenditure-based. Irrespective of the type of expenditure cut simulated, non-Keynesian effects in QUEST are associated with a reaction of aggregate consumption to expected future incomes; in the case of cuts to the government wage bill the investment channel is also relevant. fiscal consolidations; fiscal policy in the EU; non-keynesian effects of fiscal policy...|$|R
