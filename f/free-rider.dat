I {{have before}} noticed--though I {{am not sure}} that you have yet {{believed}} my statement of it--the significance of Sir Walter's as of Shakspeare's names; Diana 'Vernon, semper viret,' gives you the conditions of purity and youthful strength or spring which imply the highest state of libertas. By corruption of the idea of purity, you get the modern heroines of London Journal--or perhaps we may more fitly call it 'Cockney-daily'--literature. You have one of them in perfection, for instance, in Mr. Charles Reade's 'Griffith Gaunt'-- [...] "Lithe, and vigorous, and one with her great white gelding;" [...] and liable to be entirely changed in her mind about the destinies of her life by a quarter of an hour's conversation with a gentleman unexpectedly handsome; the hero also being a person who looks at people whom he dislikes, with eyes [...] "like a dog's in the dark;" [...] and both hero and heroine having souls and intellects also precisely corresponding to those of a dog's in the dark, which is indeed the essential picture of the practical English national mind at this moment,--happy if it remains doggish,--Circe not usually being content with changing people into dogs only. For the Diana Vernon of the Greek is Artemis Laphria, who is friendly to the dog; not to the swine. Do you see, by the way, how perfectly the image is carried out by Sir Walter in putting his Diana on the border country? [...] "Yonder blue hill is in Scotland," [...] she says to her cousin,--not in the least thinking less of him for having been concerned, it may be, in one of Bob Roy's forays.

40|$|Free-riding {{is one of}} {{the most}} serious {{problems}} encountered in Peer-to-peer (P 2 P) systems like Bit Torrent. Incentive mechanisms, including those based on reputation have been proposed to deal with this problem, but are still not effective in preventing <b>free-riders</b> from completing a download. This is because they discover the free-riders' behavior during or after the process of trading, giving <b>free-riders</b> the opportunity to download from others. In this paper, we propose PreDiscover, a novel approach to prevent free-riding behavior in Bit Torrent. In PreDiscover, regular peers and <b>free-riders</b> can be recognized before trading.

40|$|A {{well-known}} {{problem in}} peer-to-peer networks is free-riding, where users {{do not share}} resources in return for what they consume. <b>Free-riders</b> can be distinguished in two categories: diehard <b>free-riders</b> {{that are willing to}} subvert the network’s protocol in order to free-ride, and lazy <b>free-riders</b> that are reluctant to share but do follow the protocol. An important body of research focuses on die-hard <b>free-riders</b> in the popular BitTorrent file-sharing network, but in practice diehard free-riding in BitTorrent is not often observed. Lazy free-riding, on the other hand, is often observed, and in this thesis we investigate whether BitTorrent provides lazy <b>free-riders</b> with an incentive to share. Based on a game-theoretical model, we prove that this is the case for some lazy <b>free-riders,</b> but not for all. We then proceed to investigate the same for BarterCast, a new distributed reputation mechanism that is added to the BitTorrent-based Tribler network to provide additional sharing incentives. Based on an extended version of the same model, we prove that BarterCast also provides incentives only to some lazy <b>free-riders,</b> but not for all. We verify these results with simulations, and find that in practice, even fewer incentives are given than our model predicts. However, we show that lazy free-riding can provide a gain but also a loss, and that the net result is difficult to predict, which can be seen as an additional incentive against free-riding.

40|$|Self-interest {{frequently}} causes individuals {{engaged in}} joint enterprises to choose {{actions that are}} counterproductive. <b>Free-riders</b> can invade a society of cooperators, causing a tragedy of the commons. Such social dilemmas can be overcome by positive or negative incentives. Even though an incentive-providing institution may protect a cooperative society from invasion by <b>free-riders,</b> it cannot always convert a society of <b>free-riders</b> to cooperation. In the latter case, both norms, cooperation and defection, are stable: To avoid a collapse to full defection, cooperators must be sufficiently numerous initially. A society of <b>free-riders</b> is then caught in a social trap, and the institution is unable to provide an escape, except at a high, possibly prohibitive cost. Here, we analyze the interplay of (a) incentives provided by institutions and (b) the effects of voluntary participation. We show that this combination fundamentally improves the efficiency of incentives. In particular, optional participation allows institutions punishing <b>free-riders</b> to overcome the social dilemma {{at a much lower}} cost, and to promote a globally stable regime of cooperation. This removes the social trap and implies that whenever a society of cooperators cannot be invaded by <b>free-riders,</b> it will necessarily become established in the long run, through social learning, irrespective of the initial number of cooperators. We also demonstrate that punishing provides a "lighter touch" than rewarding, guaranteeing full cooperation at considerably lower cost...|$|R

In this paper, we have proposed a novel P 2 P live streaming system, called super-peer assisted live streaming architecture (SALSA). In SALSA, super-peers, which have high upload bandwidth and serve many <b>free-riders,</b> are eligible to receive an incentive reward that is the ability to watch high quality videos. The server places high-quality-view-tickets at auction to make the super-peers serve <b>free-riders</b> more efficiently. We have proposed novel auction mechanisms and a heuristic algorithm.

Using a Public Goods Game, we are interested in assessing how cooperation rates change when agents can play one of two different reactive strategies, i. e., they can pay a cost {{in order to reduce the}} payoff of <b>free-riders,</b> or they can know others 2 ̆ 7 reputation and then either play defect with <b>free-riders,</b> or refuse to interact with them.

We assume an idiosyncratic willingness to join the community; cooperation bears a fixed cost while free-riding bears a (moral) idiosyncratic cost proportional to the fraction of cooperators. We show that the system presents two types of equilibria: fixed points (Nash equilibria) with a mixture of cooperators and <b>free-riders</b> and cycles where the size of the community, as well as the proportion of cooperators and <b>free-riders,</b> vary periodically...|$|R

40|$|We examine why {{heterogenous}} communities {{may fail}} to provide public goods. Current work characterizes sanctioning <b>free-riders</b> as an under-supplied public good.

But the power to expropriate defectors {{can also be used}} to expropriate outgroups. Heterogenous societies may be inefficient because minorities, rather than <b>free-riders,</b> are expropriated. Even if this is not so, groups’ different beliefs about the reasons for expropriation may make the threat of punishment less effective at preventing free-riding.

40|$|In {{public goods}} games, {{individuals}} contribute {{to create a}} benefit for a group. However this attracts <b>free-riders,</b> who enjoy the benefits without necessarily contributing. Nonetheless, in real-life scenarios cooperation does not collapse. Several explanations have been proposed in order to explain this phenomenon, such as punishment and signaling. In the present work, we investigate the effects of new elements associated with punishment upon signaling such as gossiping and bribery. Agents may denounce <b>free-riders</b> (who on their turn get punished) or may be bribed to remain silent and even spread rumors of false good behavior. Having a model with richer social mechanisms enable us to test how cooperation develops in situations in which players have social attachments. Our results show that when punishment and bribery are present, the levels of contribution are kept at a relatively higher value compared to the situation when no punishment is exercised. As to what regards gossiping, {{if the number of}} <b>free-riders</b> is high, finding mechanisms to prevent gossiping could be an important step in order to increase the contribution.

50|$|In {{emphasizing}} the injustice frame, culture theory also addresses the <b>free-rider</b> problem. The <b>free-rider</b> problem {{refers to the}} idea that people will not be motivated to participate in a social movement that will use up their personal resources (e.g., time, money, etc.) if they can still receive the benefits without participating. In other words, if person X knows that movement Y is working to improve environmental conditions in his neighborhood, he is presented with a choice: join or not join the movement. If he believes the movement will succeed without him, he can avoid participation in the movement, save his resources, and still reap the benefits - this is free-riding. A significant problem for social movement theory has been to explain why people join movements if they believe the movement can/will succeed without their contribution. Culture theory argues that, in conjunction with social networks being an important contact tool, the injustice frame will provide the motivation for people to contribute to the movement.|$|E

Routing overlay {{networks}} use {{the current}} Internet infrastructure {{to provide support}} {{for a wide range}} of applications, such as content distribution, multiplayer games, search and web services.

In this paper, we approach the problem of increasing the reliability of overlay services by detecting and removing <b>free-riders</b> from the selfish overlay network.

A main {{purpose of this paper is}} to show experimentally that there is indeed a widespread willingness of the cooperators to punish the <b>free-riders.</b> Our results indicate that this holds true even if punishment is costly and does not provide any material benefits for the punisher. In addition, we provide evidence that <b>free-riders</b> are punished the more heavily the more they deviate from the cooperation levels of the cooperators.

40|$|Although {{empirical}} {{and theoretical}} studies affirm that punishment can elevate collaborative efforts, its emergence and stability remain elusive.

By pool-punishment, on the other hand, where resources for sanctioning are committed in advance and at large, the notion of sustainability has greater significance. In a population with <b>free-riders,</b> punishers must be strong in numbers to keep the "punishment pool" from emptying. Failure to do so renders the concept of institutionalized sanctioning futile. We show that pool-punishment in structured populations is sustainable, but only if second-order <b>free-riders</b> are sanctioned as well, and to a such degree that they cannot prevail. A discontinuous phase transition leads to an outbreak of sustainability when punishers subvert second-order <b>free-riders</b> in the competition against defectors.
