5|$|The Annals by Tacitus {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{detailed}} accounts of Germanicus' campaigns against the Germans. He wrote his account in the early years of the second century.

5|$|As the 11th New York Regiment had {{experienced}} first hand, the First Battle of Bull Run in July 1861 <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> heavy toll on Union forces, including those from New York City. As the war dragged on, a military manpower shortage {{occurred in the}} Union and Congress passed the first conscription act in United States history on March 3, 1863, authorizing the President to draft male citizens {{between the ages of}} 18 and 35 for a three-year term of military service.|$|E
5|$|Australia's biggest {{challenge}} in the post-Test tour matches was against the Leveson-Gower's XI. During the last tour in 1938, this team was effectively a full-strength England outfit, but this time Bradman insisted only six current England Test players be allowed to play. After the hosts had complied, Bradman selected a full-strength team, with the only difference from the Fifth Test team being Ring’s omission for Johnson, so McCool was left out. After Australia <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> 312-run first innings lead, the match ended in a draw after multiple rain delays.|$|E
5|$|By {{the early}} years of the 20th century, Boyce had become a multi-millionaire and <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> step back from his {{businesses}} to pursue his interests in civic affairs, devoting more time to traveling and participating in expeditions. In 1909, he embarked on a two-month trip to Europe and a large photographic expedition to Africa with photographer George R. Lawrence and cartoonist John T. McCutcheon. Over the next two decades, Boyce led expeditions to South America, Europe, and North Africa, where he visited the newly discovered tomb of King Tutankhamun.|$|E

5|$|Determined to {{complete}} the destruction of Minnesota, Catesby ap Roger Jones, acting as captain in Buchanan's absence, returned the ship to the fray the next morning, March 9. During the night, however, the ironclad Monitor had arrived and <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> position to defend Minnesota. When Virginia approached, Monitor intercepted her. The two ironclads fought for about three hours, with neither being able to inflict significant damage on the other. The duel ended indecisively, Virginia returning to her home at the Gosport Navy Yard for repairs and strengthening, and Monitor to her station defending Minnesota. The ships did not fight again, and the blockade remained in place.|$|E
5|$|During the investigation, {{unsuccessful}} {{attempts were}} made to match a knife taken from Beauchamp upon his arrest to the type of wound observed on Sharp's body. Efforts to match a footprint found near Sharp's house to Beauchamp were similarly unsuccessful. The posse that arrested Beauchamp <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> bloody handkerchief from the crime scene, but had lost it on the trip back to Frankfort after the arrest. The best evidence presented by the prosecution was the testimony of Sharp's wife Eliza that she heard the killer's voice and that it was distinctly high-pitched. When given the opportunity to hear Beauchamp's voice, she identified it as that of the killer.|$|E
5|$|Edward {{married his}} second wife, Ælfflæd, {{at about the}} time of his father's death, {{probably}} because Ecgwynn had died, although she may have been put aside. The new marriage weakened Æthelstan's position, as his step-mother naturally favoured the interests of her own sons, Ælfweard and Edwin. By 920 Edward <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> third wife, Eadgifu, probably after putting Ælfflæd aside. Eadgifu also had two sons, the future kings Edmund and Eadred. Edward had several daughters, perhaps as many as nine.|$|E

Higginbotham rejected a new contract {{and as a result}} was placed on the transfer list in July 2006. He told the local press that he felt disrespected the way Southampton chairman Rupert Lowe had handled his contract – he <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> pay cut to move from Derby, a 40% pay cut following relegation, and then the new contract offer was lower still than his current contract.|$|E
5|$|Hess was {{discharged}} from the armed forces in December 1918. The family fortunes <b>had</b> <b>taken</b> <b>a</b> serious downturn, as their business interests in Egypt had been expropriated by the British. Hess joined the Thule Society, an antisemitic right-wing Völkisch group, and a Freikorps, one of many such volunteer paramilitary organisations active in Germany at the time. Bavaria witnessed frequent and often bloody conflicts between right-wing {{groups such as the}} Freikorps and left-wing forces as they fought for control of the state during this period. Hess was a participant in street battles in early 1919 and led a group which distributed thousands of antisemitic pamphlets in Munich.|$|E

In 2013, Henry's base salary dropped to $3.75million setting him behind Robbie Keane's $4million base salary.
