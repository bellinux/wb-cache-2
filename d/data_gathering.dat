25|$|Participant-observation {{suggests}} that by immersing oneself {{in the subject}} being studied, a researcher is presumed to gain understanding of the subject. Criticisms of participant-observation as a data-gathering technique are similar to criticisms of other approaches to the paranormal, but also include an increased threat to the objectivity of the researcher, unsystematic gathering of data, reliance on subjective measurement, and possible observer effects (observation may distort the observed behavior). Specific <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> methods, such as recording EMF readings at haunted locations have their own criticisms beyond those attributed to the participant-observation approach itself.|$|E

In psychiatry and community mental health, evidence-based practice guides have been created by such organizations as the Substance Abuse and Mental Health Services Administration and the Robert Wood Johnson Foundation, {{in conjunction with the}} National Alliance on Mental Illness. Evidence-based practice has now spread into a diverse range of areas outside of health where the same principles are known by names such as results-focused policy, managing for outcomes, evidence-informed practice etc.|$|E

25|$|While in {{hibernation}} mode in July 2012, New Horizons started gathering scientific data with SWAP, PEPSSI and VBSDC. Although {{it was originally}} planned to activate just the VBSDC, other instruments were powered on the initiative of principal investigator Alan Stern who decided they could use the opportunity to collect valuable heliospheric data. Before activating the other two instruments, ground tests were conducted {{to make sure that}} the expanded <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> in this phase of the mission would not limit available energy, memory and fuel in the future and that all systems are functioning during the flyby. The first set of data was transmitted in January 2013 during a three-week activation from hibernation.

25|$|The {{previously}} announced mission {{end date}} of July 1, 2008, {{came and went}} but mission operations continued albeit in a reduced capacity. The availability of science <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> was limited to only when Ulysses was in contact with a ground station due to the deteriorating S-band downlink margin no longer being able to support simultaneous real-time data and tape recorder playback. When the spacecraft was out of contact with a ground station, the S-band transmitter was switched off and the power was diverted to the internal heaters {{to add to the}} warming of the hydrazine. On June 30, 2009, ground controllers sent commands to switch to the low gain antennas. This stopped communications with the spacecraft, in combination with previous the commands to set the shut down of its transmitter entirely.|$|E

It asked the National Statistician to ensure sufficient research is undertaken and the feasibility of alternative methods validated in the run up to 2021 to replace the traditional national census and intermediate surveying approach from after that date. The Government also indicated it recognised the implications of greater data-sharing between government departments on public confidence in the security and privacy of their personal information.|$|E

500|$|All <b>data</b> <b>gathering</b> {{involves}} {{difficulties with}} the potential inaccuracy of research subjects' reports. For instance, when [...] "people doing domestic labor {{have no reason to}} pay close attention to the amount of time tasks take ... they [...] often underestimate time spent in familiar activities." [...] Measuring time can also be problematic because [...] "the slowest and most inefficient workers [...] the greatest workload." [...] Time use in assessing childcare is criticized as [...] "easily obscur gender differences in workload. Men and women may both put in {{the same amount of time}} being responsible for children but as participant observation studies have shown, many men are more likely to 'babysit' their children while doing something for themselves, such as watching TV. Men's standards of care may be limited to ensuring the children are not hurt. Dirty diapers may be ignored or deliberately left until the mother returns." [...] A paradoxical aspect of this problem is that those most burdened may not be able to participate in the studies: [...] "It is usually those women with the heaviest work loads who choose not to participate in these studies." [...] In general, measurement of time causes [...] "some of the most demanding aspects of unpaid work [...] and the premise that time is an appropriate tool for measuring women's unpaid work goes unchallenged." [...] Surveys have also been criticized for lacking [...] "depth and complexity" [...] as questions cannot be specifically tailored to particular circumstances.|$|E

50|$|Relatively little current, {{valid data}} exists about today's reservations.

Furthermore, the rural nature of many reservations, the lack of available contact information and telephone numbers, protective rules by tribal councils, and a distrust of outsiders present data collection challenges. Lastly, an overwhelming majority of research focuses on the Pine Ridge and Navajo Reservations, suggesting a need for more comparative analyses of conditions on individual reservations.|$|R
