5|$|Florence Harding became deeply {{involved}} in her husband's career, both at the Star and once he entered politics. Exhibiting her father's determination and business sense, she helped turn the Star into a profitable enterprise through her tight management of the paper's circulation department. She has been credited with helping Harding achieve more than he might have alone; {{some have suggested that}} she pushed <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the White House.|$|E
5|$|Stewie hitches a {{ride with}} a trucker and so Brian follows <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Canada. On the way, Stewie accidentally causes a traffic pileup by {{discharging}} a flare pistol in the cab of the truck, which catches fire and explodes. Crashing his car in a chain reaction, Brian becomes angry and tells Stewie that Santa does not exist. Stewie becomes frustrated and continues to attempt to hitchhike, corecing Brian to join him. The pair then encounter a Canadian who gives them his snowmobile.|$|E
5|$|In a {{memorandum}} of 1908, Scott presented his view that man-hauling to the South Pole was impossible and that motor traction was needed. Snow vehicles {{did not yet}} exist however, and so his engineer Reginald Skelton developed {{the idea of a}} caterpillar track for snow surfaces. In the middle of 1909 Scott realised that motors were unlikely to get <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the Pole, and decided additionally to take horses (based on Shackleton's near success in attaining the Pole, using ponies), and dogs and skis after consultation with Nansen during trials of the motors in Norway in March 1910. Man-hauling would still be needed on the Polar Plateau, on the assumption that motors and animals could not ascend the crevassed Beardmore Glacier.|$|E

25|$|Scotland quickly now capitulated. Edward I deposed King John at Montrose Castle: {{the symbols}} of the Scottish kingship were {{stripped}} from him, including the ripping of the royal coat of arms from his surcoat (thereby earning him the enduring title Toom Tabard ('Empty Coat')). King Edward rode north from Montrose on an extended march that took <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to Elgin, which he reached on 26 July 1296. He remained in the town’s castle for a few days, taking the fealty {{of a number of}} Scots nobles, including Bishop Robert Wishart of Glasgow, before returning to England.|$|E
25|$|In England's first innings, {{the local}} boy was cheered affectionately {{all the way}} to the middle by an avid Oval crowd. Fred Spofforth, however, soon walloped the hero three excruciating blows—one in the ribs, another on the knee and one more on the elbow. Read was {{compelled}} to hold up the game on two of these occasions to take time to convalesce, and it was, by all reports, an exceptionally valiant knock. Read finished unbeaten on nineteen, the second best score of the innings, and the masses cheered <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back to the pavilion just as they had cheered him from it; indeed, they it patently apparent right through this game that he was an authentic darling of the people.|$|E
25|$|A {{man named}} Vance Connor is {{inducted}} into the Springfield Wall of Fame, and Homer recounts how he ran against Vance for class president {{in high school and}} lost. Later, at Moe's Tavern, Lenny and Carl confess to Homer that his old high school principal had ordered them to bury the ballot box containing the votes to the election. After they dig up the ballot box, Lisa counts the votes, and Homer is shocked to see that the votes put him as the winner. Outraged, he meets his old principal, Dondelinger, in a retirement center, who explains why he had to hide the ballot box: two students had talked their classmates into voting for Homer so that, after he had lost, they could laugh at <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> through high school. He revealed it worked out well for them and Vance.|$|E

50|$|A guy {{falls in}} love blindly with a young {{beautiful}} girl. This blind love leads him into deep trouble, and further separates him from other people like one man versus the entire world. In these dark situations, where one surely gives up on everything, he doesn't, and thus keeps on believing and trusting on his blind love, which eventually shows <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>ways</b> to be out from <b>all</b> <b>the</b> difficulties.|$|R
25|$|In 1977 their rivalry {{culminated in}} what became a {{peculiar}} race. Maertens punctured on the Koppenberg {{and was given}} a wheel by a spectator who pushed <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> up. De Vlaeminck broke clear, but punctured shortly after and was caught by a returning Maertens. As both riders were alone {{at the front of}} the race, De Vlaeminck refused to work. For 70km Maertens rode to the finish with De Vlaeminck on his wheel and was easily beaten by the latter in a two-man sprint. It was De Vlaeminck's only win. To this day, both protagonists make contradictory statements about what happened. Maertens stated that the judges had told him he would be disqualified for his illegal wheel-change and that De Vlaeminck had offered him 300.000 francs to keep riding. De Vlaeminck denies this, saying that he tactically stayed on Maertens' wheel, whom he considered the better sprinter. After the race, the controversy heightened even more, when Maertens and third-place finisher Walter Planckaert tested positive for doping and were both disqualified.|$|E
25|$|Early on 16 October, Marie Antoinette was {{declared}} {{guilty of the}} three main charges against her: depletion of the national treasury, conspiracy against {{the internal and external}} security of the State, and high treason because of her intelligence activities {{in the interest of the}} enemy; the latter charge alone was enough to condemn her to death. At worst, she and her lawyers had expected life imprisonment. In the hours left to her, she composed a letter to her sister-in-law, Madame Élisabeth, affirming her clear conscience, her Catholic faith, and her love and concern for her children. The letter did not reach Élisabeth. Preparing for her execution, she had to change clothes in front of her guards. She put on a plain white dress, white being the color worn by widowed queens of France. Her hair was shorn, her hands bound painfully behind her back and she was put on a rope leash. Unlike her husband, who had been taken to his execution in a carriage (carrosse), she had to sit in an open cart (charrette) for the hour it took to convey her from the Conciergerie via the rue Saint-Honoré thoroughfare to reach the guillotine erected in the Place de la Révolution, (the present-day Place de la Concorde). She maintained her composure, despite the insults of the jeering crowd. A constitutional priest was assigned to her to hear her final confession. He sat by her in the cart, but she ignored <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> to the scaffold.|$|E
500|$|During game six, Valeri Kharlamov was {{targeted}} by Team Canada for attention. According to Conacher, [...] "every {{time they get}} a chance, they're taking him for a rough ride along the boards." [...] Kharlamov {{was the target of}} numerous bodychecks by Brad Park. Things started to heat up in the second period. Kharlamov had knocked down Bobby Clarke, who in retaliation, rubbed Kharlamov's face with his glove to raise Kharlamov's temper and the two exchanged punches. Bergman then stepped in and bumped into Kharlamov and harassed <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back to the bench. Peter Mahovlich later elbowed Kharlamov, who retaliated by dumping Mahovlich to the ice. Later, Clarke raced down the ice to catch a streaking Kharlamov and deliberately slashed Kharlamov's already sore ankle, injuring it and according to reports, fracturing it. Kharlamov skated over to the Canadian bench and yelled at the Canadians, before limping off the ice to the dressing room. The referees handed Clarke a minor penalty for slashing and an additional 10-minute misconduct penalty. Later, with Clarke still stuck in the box serving the misconduct, the referees also gave Dennis Hull a slashing penalty, during which Yakushev scored. On his injured ankle, Kharlamov returned to play and very nearly scored on Dryden during a power play later in the second period.|$|E

2500|$|Grant's {{popularity}} was high, but fading. [...] Washburne conjectured {{that had}} Grant stayed abroad longer, {{the wave of}} adulation that greeted him on his return might have carried <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back to the White House. [...] Conkling placed Grant's name in nomination with an elegant speech, his most famous line being: [...] "When asked which state he hails from, our sole reply shall be, he hails from Appomattox and its famous apple tree." [...] With 370 votes needed for nomination, the first ballot had Grant at 304, Blaine at 284, Sherman at 93, and the rest scattered to minor candidates. [...] Subsequent ballots followed, with roughly the same result; neither Grant nor Blaine could win. [...] After thirty-six ballots, Blaine's delegates deserted him and combined {{with those of other}} candidates to nominate a compromise candidate: Representative James A. Garfield of Ohio. [...] Grant received 306 votes on the final ballot, his supporters staying committed to their man to the bitter end. [...] Logan moved that the nomination be made unanimous, and it was, but those 306 Stalwarts were immortalized in Republican myth.|$|E
2500|$|Glitter's career took a {{downturn}} {{towards the end}} of the 1970s, leading him to declare bankruptcy in 1977, though he later blamed the high tax rate in the UK at the time. He entered bankruptcy a second time over unpaid tax in the 1990s. Under financial pressure, not even a pair of Top 40 hit singles ("It Takes All Night Long" [...] and [...] "A Little Boogie Woogie in the Back of My Mind") could lift <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way</b> back. It took the post-punk audience, and some of its artists who still respected Glitter's work, to do that; he had been an influence on post-punk, new wave, Britpop and glam metal, as well as early punk rock itself. Around this time, Glitter settled into being a performer with a niche following that continued until his conviction for possession of child pornography in 1999. This helped provide the opportunity for Glitter to cut a dance medley of his greatest hits, [...] "All That Glitters", which charted in 1981. Within three years, he was playing 80 shows a year at colleges and nightclubs and had chart hits [...] "Dance Me Up" [...] (UK No. 25) and [...] "Another Rock and Roll Christmas" [...] (UK No. 7).|$|E
2500|$|His {{message of}} a {{reformed}} clergy was in great demand (though interestingly, {{he had to}} call for armed help from the Admiral's men to evict an Augustinian friar from the pulpit at Abbéville). Later that year he tried to bring a heretic to see the error of his ways. Jean Langlois was a priest who had travelled widely—in Spain, Provence, Italy and Bohemia where he had picked up some dangerous ideas. On 3 June 1496 he pushed the priest serving Mass at Notre Dame Cathedral and scattered the Hosts from the chalice before stamping all over them and declaring {{the idea of the}} real presence of Christ in them to be a superstition. He was also a brother of one of Standonck's students, so Jan visited him in prison to try to get him to repent, which [...] he did. However, when he learned he was to be handed over to the civil authorities—to be put to death—he retracted his repentance. He was ceremoniously stripped of his priesthood in front of Notre Dame, and the public executioner chopped off the hand that had offensively touched the sacred chalice. He was then put backwards on a donkey and led to the pig market to be burned. Standonck followed <b>him</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> <b>way,</b> preaching and imploring him to repent until he was so exhausted he could not speak. Langlois repented just as he was being burned. Standonck declared that from henceforth he would maintain a strict Lenten fast.|$|E
