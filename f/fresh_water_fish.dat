5|$|Twenty-nine {{species of}} <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>fish</b> are {{recognized}} on {{the territory of}} peninsula, including trout, stickleback, northern pike, and European perch. The rivers are an important habitat for the Atlantic salmon, which return from Greenland and the Faroe Islands to spawn in fresh water. As a result of this, a recreational fishery has been developed, {{with a number of}} remote lodges and camps available to host sport-fishermen. The Kandalaksha Nature Reserve, established in 1932 to protect the population of common eider, is organized in thirteen clusters located in the Kandalaksha Gulf of the Kola Peninsula and along the coasts of the Barents Sea.|$|E

25|$|Orthalicus reses reses {{is listed}} as {{threatened}} on the United States Fish and Wildlife Service list of endangered species, since 2 August 1978. It was originally listed as Orthalicus reses. However, Othalicus reses comprises two recognized taxa, and only Orthalicus reses reses is threatened. In the time of listing, the Florida Game and <b>Fresh</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Fish</b> Commission favored listing, since intensive development has reduced the range to Stock Island. Leslie Hubricht and Alan Solem supported listing. Solem believed that collecting or expansion of tourist facilities could have drastic effects. The primary threat to Orthalicus reses reses {{at the time of}} listing was habitat loss due to development. Additional threats include pesticides, hurricanes, vegetation trimming along utility corridors, over-utilization of the habitat areas, and non-native predators. Trends in those threats are continuing at the same level, except for predation, the threat level for which is unknown. The population trend is unknown in 2009.|$|E

25|$|Dairy {{farming is}} fairly well developed. Also {{there is a}} {{chilling}} plant in the city. Kollam is an important maritime and port city of the state. Fishing has a prominent place in {{the economy of the}} district. Neendakara and Sakthikulangara villages in the suburbs of the city have thriving fisheries. An estimated 134,973 persons are engaged in fishing and allied activities. Cheriazheekkal, Alappad, Pandarathuruthu, Puthenthura, Neendakara, Thangasseri, Eravipuram and Paravur are eight of the 26 important fishing villages. There are 24 inland fishing villages also. Recognizing the unique location and infrastructure available, the Government has initiated steps for establishing a fishing harbour at Neendakara which is expected to increase fish production by 15%. Average fish landing is estimated at 85,275 tonnes per year. One-third of the state's fish catch is from Kollam. Nearly 3000 mechanised boats are operating from the fishing harbour. FFDA and VFFDA promote <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>fish</b> culture and prawn farming respectively. A model fishing village with 100 houses is being built at Eravipuram. A model prawn farm is being built at Ayiramthengu, and several new hatcheries are also planned to cater {{to the needs of the}} aquaculturists. Kerala's only turkey farm and a regional poultry farm are at Kureepuzha.|$|E
25|$|Fishing {{scenes are}} rarely {{represented}} in ancient Greek culture, {{a reflection of}} the low social status of fishing. However, Oppian of Corycus, a Greek author wrote a major treatise on sea fishing, the Halieulica or Halieutika, composed between 177 and 180. This is the earliest such work to have survived to the modern day. The consumption of fish varied in accordance with the wealth and location of the household. In the Greek islands and on the coast, fresh fish and seafood (squid, octopus, and shellfish) were common. They were eaten locally but more often transported inland. Sardines and anchovies were regular fare for the citizens of Athens. They were sometimes sold fresh, but more frequently salted. A stele of the late 3rd century BCE from the small Boeotian city of Akraiphia, on Lake Copais, provides us with a list of fish prices. The cheapest was skaren (probably parrotfish) whereas Atlantic bluefin tuna was three times as expensive. Common salt water fish were yellowfin tuna, red mullet, ray, swordfish or sturgeon, a delicacy which was eaten salted. Lake Copais itself was famous in all Greece for its eels, celebrated by the hero of The Acharnians. Other <b>fresh</b> <b>water</b> <b>fish</b> were pike-fish, carp and the less appreciated catfish.|$|E
500|$|As {{early as}} 1998, the Florida mouse was a federal C2 {{candidate}} taxon, and considered Threatened by the Florida Committee on Rare and Endangered Plants and Animals. The mouse {{was named a}} Species of Special Concern by the Florida Game and <b>Fresh</b> <b>Water</b> <b>Fish</b> Commission. The Florida mouse inhabits a restricted habitat in the United States and that habitat is threatened not only by agricultural and real estate development but by wildfire suppression. Habitat decline {{is expected to continue}} into the future. [...] The mouse is dependent upon gopher tortoise burrows, but disease and habitat loss are responsible for decline in the tortoise population. Red imported fire ants (Solenopsis invicta) threaten both tortoise and mouse populations. The IUCN has listed the species as Vulnerable and recommends further study of the species, maintenance of viable populations of gopher tortoises, and the preservation and management of suitable habitat for the species. The mouse is protected on several conservation lands across central Florida. Occurrences of the Florida mouse are protected at Archbold Biological Station, Ocala National Forest, and others.|$|E

40|$|Background: Given the {{globally}} poor {{protection of}} <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> for their intrinsic ecological values, assessments {{are needed to}} determine how well <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> and supported <b>fish</b> species are incidentally protected within existing terrestrial protected-area networks, and to identify their vulnerability to human-induced disturbances. To date, gaps in data have severely constrained any attempt to explore the representation of <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> in tropical regions. Methodology and Results: We determined the distribution of <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> and <b>fish</b> diversity in the Wet Tropics of Queensland, Australia. We then used distribution data of <b>fresh</b> <b>waters,</b> <b>fish</b> species, human-induced disturbances, and the terrestrial protected-area network to assess the effectiveness of terrestrial protected areas for <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> and <b>fish</b> species. We also identified human-induced disturbances likely to influence the effectiveness of freshwater protection and evaluated the vulnerability of <b>fresh</b> <b>waters</b> to these disturbances within and outside protected areas.
