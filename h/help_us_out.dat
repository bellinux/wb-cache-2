2500|$|The album's {{release date}} {{was once again}} pushed back to January or March 2005 while a final {{recording}} session was held in Mississauga, Ontario to re-record most of the songs {{that would make the}} album.

[...] Coutts recounted the atmosphere of the final recording session. [...] "It was kind of like a musical community, like friends and musicians would stop by and people that were working there, part of the recording team. Bob sang vocals; Bob played guitar.

[...] These sessions brought the whole project back into focus for the band, easing many of the tensions that had arisen earlier. According to Coutts, [...] "I don't know what would have happened if not for that time." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "I don't suppose I {{need to stop}} at the {{intelligence}} office. I presume Mr. Barker will show you how to work the elevator. He <b>helped</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> with it himself at first." ...|$|R

60|$|The {{truth is}} that we had not had very much meaning {{of the sort that}} you stand and deliver, though we were aware of a large, vague wisdom in our words. But we {{perceived}} that our friend had no intention of <b>helping</b> <b>us</b> <b>out,</b> and on the whole we thought it best to temporize.|$|R

6000|$|... "I can't {{make up my}} {{own mind}} about Mr. Lutchester," [...] Pamela sighed.

60|$|At last, our old, never-failing friend, William, <b>helped</b> <b>us</b> <b>out</b> again, as he {{had often}} done at a dead lift.
