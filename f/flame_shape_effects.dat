40|$|Detailed {{numerical}} studies through unsteady simulations {{with detailed}} hydrogen chemistry {{have been reported}} for premixed H- 2 -air flames in straight microtubes to understand the role of flame-wall coupling {{and its effect on}} flame dynamics for a range of wall heat transfer conditions. Depending on the wall heat transfer conditions, and tube diameters, varying <b>flame</b> <b>shapes</b> were observed. These flame modes are represented with <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> angles and corresponding <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> is correlated to wall heat transfer conditions. It has been observed that an increase in wall heat transfer coefficient, h, though it increases the heat loss from a propagating flame, does not necessarily lead to a monotonic decrease in flame propagation speed. A transition regime, where the propagating <b>flame</b> changes its <b>shape,</b> has been identified. The variation of mass flux {{in the vicinity of the}} propagating flame has been used to gain a better understanding of flow-redirection and its impact on <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> and <b>flame</b> propagation speed for premixed H- 2 -air mixtures...|$|R

40|$|This {{research}} program involves {{the study of}} single droplets and linear arrays of droplets in weakly-buoyant and non-bouyant environments. The {{primary purpose of the}} single droplet work was to (1) provide a data base from which to compare droplet array results and (2) to correlate the effects of buoyancy on <b>flame</b> <b>shape.</b> Traditionally convective <b>effects</b> in droplet combustion are represented in terms of the Reynolds number, Re, for forced convection and the Grashof number, Gr, for natural convection. Typically, corrections to the burning rate constant for convective effects are written in terms of Re or Gr(exp 1). The Stefan velocity is not included in these correlations, even though from purely physical reasons, one would expect it to be important, especially at higher burning rates. The flame distortion due to convective effects is less documented quantitatively. Kumagai and Isoda do predict <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> in natural and forced convective flow fields. Their focus, however, was to predict the actual flame dimensions. Law and co-workers used reduced pressure, high oxidizer ambients to obtain spherical flames. This implies that buoyant flows were reduced at the low pressures, as indicated by a very small Grashof number. Ross et al, however, using scaling arguments showed that reducing the pressure does not have a large effect on the magnitude of the buoyant velocity. Struk et al showed elongated <b>flame</b> <b>shapes</b> during simulated (porous sphere) droplet combustion. The elongation of the flames was due to residual gravity levels aboard the reduced gravity aircraft on which the experiments were conducted. These <b>flame</b> <b>shapes,</b> as well as some data from the literature were interpreted based on a dimensionless grouping called the sphericity parameter, Sp. Sp is the ratio of a characteristic computed buoyant velocity to the Stefan velocity at the flame front. One purpose of the droplet arrays work is to extend the database and theories that exist for single droplets into the regime where droplet interactions are important. The eventual goal being to use the results of this work as inputs to models on spray combustion where droplets seldom burn individually; instead the combustion history of a droplet is strongly influenced by the presence of the neighboring droplets. Recently, Annamali and Ryan have summarized he current status of droplet array, cloud and spray combustion. A number of simplified theories led numerical studies of droplet vaporization/combustion where multiple droplet effects are present are now available. These theories all neglect the effect of buoyancy. Experimentally, most studies to date suffer the effects of buoyancy. It is the dominant transport mechanism in the problem. Only the works of Law and co-worker and more recently by Mikami et al were performed in an environment where buoyancy effects were small. Law and co-workers were limited to high oxygen index, low pressure ambient environments since there studies were conducted in normal gravity...|$|R
40|$|Unsteady {{numerical}} simulations {{with detailed}} chemistry {{have been carried}} out for premixed stoichiometric CH 4 -air and H- 2 -air mixtures in straight microtubes to understand the flame-wall coupling and its effect on flame dynamics for a range of wall heat transfer conditions.

These flame modes are represented with <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> angles and the corresponding <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> is correlated to the wall heat transfer conditions. Various similarities in flame propagation characteristics have been observed for both of the fuels. A normalization technique has been adopted to establish the independence of variation of nondimensional flame propagation velocity on fuel type. It has been observed that an increase in convective heat transfer coefficient, h, though increasing the heat loss from a propagating flame, does not necessarily lead to a monotonic decrease in flame propagation speed.

40|$|Numerical {{modeling}} {{results of}} M-and V-shaped methane/air flames with an equivalence ratio of 0. 7 are presented and compared with experimental results in this paper. The numerical model uses a one-step chemistry model and a vorticity-streamfunction formulation for the flow field. The experimental results used {{to validate the}} model consist of <b>flame</b> <b>shapes,</b> stand-off distances, velocity profiles measured with Laser Doppler Velocimetry and critical transition and blowoff gradients. The <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> and the stand-off distance of the M-shaped flame are reproduced well by the model. The values of the vertical velocity are. however, lower than the experimental values. The lower vertical velocities computed with the model are due to relatively small differences between the computed and the experimental <b>flame</b> <b>shape.</b> The shape of the V-shaped flame is also reproduced reasonably well by the model. The stand-off distance predicted by the model differs 0. 8 mm from the experimental value. The vertical velocities predicted by the model are, as for the M-shaped flame, lower than the experimental values. This is also caused by <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> differences. The small differences between the computed and experimental <b>flame</b> <b>shapes</b> is probably related with the absence of highly diffusive radicals in the one-step model. The model {{is also used to}} compute the critical transition (from M-to V-shaped flame) and blowoff (of the V-shaped flame) gradients.

Propane-air flames were imaged and analyzed at equivalence ratios of 0. 6 to 0. 8, mean flow velocities of 3. 5 to 5. 5 m/s and excitation frequencies of 135 Hz to 555 Hz. It was observed that with increasing excitation frequency, mean <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> gradually became wider up to a Strouhal number of about 2. 5 and then slowly reverted back to the unexcited <b>flame</b> <b>shape.</b> Such large changes in mean <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> and possibly flow field under acoustic excitations can significantly affect flame dynamics.

40|$|International audienceThis paper {{focuses on}} the {{experimental}} and numerical investigation of the shape taken by confined turbulent CH 4 /H 2 /air premixed flames stabilized over a bluff-body swirling injector. Two configurations, which correspond to two levels of H 2 enrichment in the CH 4 /H 2 fuel blend, are investigated. Experiments show that high H 2 concentrations promote M <b>flame</b> <b>shapes,</b> whereas V <b>flame</b> <b>shapes</b> are observed for lower values of H 2 enrichment. In both cases, non-reacting and reacting flow Large Eddy Simulation (LES) calculations were performed. Numerical results are compared with detailed velocimetry measurements under non-reacting and reacting conditions, OH-laser induced fluorescence and OH* chemiluminescence measurements. All temperatures of solid walls of the experimental setup including the combustor dump plane, the injector central rod tip, the combustor sidewalls and the quartz windows were also characterized. Assuming a fully adiabatic combustion chamber, LES always predicts an M <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> and does not capture the V to M shape transition observed in the experiments when the hydrogen concentration in the fuel blend is increased. By accounting for non-adiabaticity using measured thermal boundary conditions, simulations predict the correct flame stabilization for both V and M flames and show a good agreement with experiments in terms of <b>flame</b> <b>shape.</b> Key features {{that need to be}} included in non-adiabatic simulations are finally stressed out...|$|R

50|$|Diffusion flames can be laminar {{diffusion}} flames (e.g. Candles and matches {{burning in}} the air etc.) and turbulent diffusion flames (e.g. furnaces, turbo-machinery, some liquid-fuel rocket engines and internal combustion engines) depending {{on the nature of}} mixed gas flow. Further, the <b>flame</b> <b>shapes</b> of this kind of burning are divided into two categories oxygen-rich diffusion flames and oxygen-deficient. <b>Flame</b> <b>shapes</b> also depend on the discharging velocity of fuel and air. Eddies inside the air flow {{plays an important role in}} deciding the <b>flame</b> <b>shapes.</b> With increase in discharging velocity of fuel into the air laminar diffusion flames tends to become turbulent diffusion flames. This leads to an increase in the flame height and finally it gains a maximum height (critical limit). After this limit further increase in the jet velocity of the fuel adds to instability of turbulent flame. The position where laminar flame is changing into turbulent flame is termed as “break-up point”. Increase in jet velocity after critical limit results in decrease of the whole flame height. Beyond this point the height of the break-up point reaches a certain value where even after increasing the jet velocity of fuel the flame height will not change. Studies by Hawthorne et al. prove that the chemical reaction rates in turbulent diffusion flames and in laminar diffusion flames are almost similar.|$|R

In addition, many properties of laminar diffusion flames are directly relevant to turbulent diffusion flames using laminar flamelet concepts. Finally, laminar diffusion <b>flame</b> <b>shapes</b> have been {{of interest}} since the classical study of Burke and Schumann because they involve a simple nonintrusive measurement that is convenient for evaluating <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> predictions. Motivated by these observations, the shapes of round hydrocarbon-fueled laminar jet diffusion flames were considered, emphasizing conditions where effects of buoyancy are small because most practical flames are not buoyant. Earlier studies of shapes of hydrocarbon-fueled nonbuoyant laminar jet diffusion flames considered combustion in still air and have shown that flames at the laminar smoke point are roughly {{twice as long as}} corresponding soot-free (blue) flames and have developed simple ways to estimate their shapes. Corresponding studies of hydrocarbon-fueled weakly-buoyant laminar jet diffusion flames in coflowing air have also been reported. These studies were limited to soot-containing flames at laminar smoke point conditions and also developed simple ways to estimate their shapes but the behavior of corresponding soot-free flames has not been addressed. This is unfortunate because ways of selecting flame flow properties to reduce soot concentrations are of great interest; in addition, soot-free flames are fundamentally important because they are much more computationally tractable than corresponding soot-containing flames.

Equivalence ratio of the butane/air mixture was maintained constantly at unity. The <b>flame</b> <b>shape,</b> the pressure distribution on the impingement plate and the heat transfer from the flame to the plate were greatly influenced by the interference occurred between the two flame jets. This interference caused a sharp pressure peak at the between-jet midpoint and the positive pressures at the between-jet area, which led to the separation of the wall jet from the impingement plate after collision. Such interference became more significant when the non-dimensional jet-to-jet spacing (S/d) and the nozzle-to-plate distance (H/d) were reduced. Heat transfer in the interaction zone between the jets was at the lowest rate due to this interference at the smallest S/d ratio of 2. 6, resulting from the separation of the high-temperature inner reaction zone of the flame from the impingement plate. On the other hand, the interference enhanced the heat transfer in the interaction zone between the jets when the S/d ratio was greater than 5, by enhancing the heat transfer coefficient. The average heat flux of the impingement plate was found to increase significantly with the increasing H/d ratio until H/d= 6.

Resulting from an increase in the Reynolds number, the periodic fluctuation gradually disappears, and a high frequency component appears. Its amplitude becomes high. there is a similarity between the external length and area of the flame. Analyzing the binary image of a flame can reveal the physical characteristics of turbulent diffusion flame behavior...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{discusses}} on {{the dynamic}} {{behavior of the}} flame and smoke inside a compartment fire. The compartment {{can be referred to}} a room, road tunnel, duct, compartment or a building. A series of small scales experiments were carried on four rectangular ducts that have the same height (250 mm) but different widths (125 mm, 250 mm, 500 mm and 1000 mm). Fire simulations on the same compartments were performed to investigate the effectiveness of Computational Fluid Dynamics (CFD) in predicting fire phenomenon. CFD was found capable to predict fire phenomenon such as <b>flame</b> <b>shape,</b> <b>flame</b> height and flame tilt angle similar to the experiment...|$|R
40|$|Swirl {{stabilized}} premixed flames {{are common}} in industrial gas turbines. The <b>flame</b> <b>shape</b> in the combustor is highly related to the combustion stability {{and the performance of}} the gas turbine. In the current paper, the effects of confinement on the time averaged flame structures or flame macrostructures are studied experimentally. Experiments are carried out with swirl number S = 0. 66 in two cylindrical confinements with diameters of d 1 = 39 mm and d 2 = 64 mm and confinement ratio c 1 = 0. 148 and c 2 = 0. 0567. All the experiments were carried out in atmospheric. CH∗ chemiluminescence from the flame was recorded to visualize the flame behavior. An inverse Abel image reconstruction method was employed to better distinguish the flame macrostructures. Different mechanisms forming the time averaged M <b>shape</b> <b>flames</b> are proposed and analyzed. It is found that the confinement wall {{plays an important role in}} determining the flame macrostructures. The flow structures including the inner and outer recirculation zones formed in the confinement are revealed to be the main reasons that affects different flame macrostructures. Meanwhile, the alternation of <b>flame</b> <b>shapes</b> determines the <b>flame</b> stability characteristics. A smaller confinement diameter forced the flame front to bend upstream into the outer recirculation zone hence forming a M <b>shape</b> <b>flame.</b> A strong noise caused by the interaction of the flame front in the outer recirculation zone with the combustor wall was observed. Another unsteady behavior of the flame in the bigger combustor, which was caused by the alternation of the flame root position inside and outside the premixing tube, is also presented. The V <b>shape</b> <b>flame</b> in the two combustors radiated weaker chemiluminescence but the main heat release zone was elongated than the M <b>shape</b> <b>flame.</b> Other operating conditions, i. e. total mass flow rate of the air flow and the equivalence ratio also affect the flame macrostructures. The flame blowout limits were also altered under different test conditions. The bigger confinement has better performance in stabilizing the flame by having lower lean blowout limits...|$|R
