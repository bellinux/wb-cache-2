For if the algorithm requires N steps, then b is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to F'N+1 which in turn is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equal</b> to φ'N1, where φ is the golden ratio. Since b≥φ'N1, then N1≤logφ'b. Since log10φ>1/5, (N1)/5< log10φ logφ'b = log10b. Thus, N ≤ 5 log10b. Thus, the Euclidean algorithm always needs less than O(h) divisions, where h is the number of digits in the smaller number b.|$|E

40|$|Background and Objective: In {{different}} studies, {{the prevalence}} of metabolic syndrome outbreak has been reported as high as 7 - 43 % among the women with polycystic ovary syndrome (PCOS). This study was performed to determine the prevalence and predictors of the metabolic syndrome in PCOS women in Ahvaz. Subjects and Methods: In an epidemiologic descriptive study, a total number of 53 women who attended the endocrinology clinic in Ahvaz from 2007 through 2008, and were diagnosed as PCOS, according to the Rotterdam criteria, {{were enrolled in the}} study. The prevalence of metabolic syndrome was studied {{on the basis of the}} criteria explained by American National Cholesterol Panel (ATP-III criteria) Result: Fifty three women with the mean age of 24 ± 6. 8 years were studied in this research. Prevalence of metabolic syndrome in women of Ahvaz was estimated to be as 13. 5 %, and the prevalence for individual components comprising the metabolic syndrome were: fasting glucose blood concentrations <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 110 mg/dl in 4 patient (7. 7 %), hypertension in 4 patients (7. 7 %), waist circumference <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 88 cm in 14 patients (34. 1 %), HDL less than 40 mg/dl in 12 patients (24 %), triglyceride <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> <b>equals</b> to 150 mg/dl in 5 patients (9. 4 %), IFG in 17 patients (32. 7 %), diabetes in 3 patients (5. 8 %) and dislipidemia in 31 patients (60 %). Conclusions: The Metabolic Syndrome and its elements occur frequently in women with PCOS that places them at risk for cardiovascular diseases, therefore screening for these disturbances is recommended.

40|$|A theory {{explaining}} the high aspect ratios for cloud level convection in the Venusian atmosphere is presented. The apparent flatness of large-scale convection {{cells in the}} Venusian clouds is accounted for by anisotropic eddy diffusion and radiative transfer effects. Horizontal eddy diffusivities {{must be at least}} ten-fold <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> vertical diffusivities. Anisotropy ratios <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to 1, 000 are sufficient to explain the flattening in cases where the vertical eddy diffusivity is <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to 100, 000 sq cm/s and the effects of radiative transfer are negligible. For vertical diffusivity <b>greater</b> <b>than</b> <b>or</b> approximately <b>equal</b> to 100, 000 sq cm/s, radiative transfer contributes to the flattening. Radiative transfer alone can not account for the apparent aspect ratios, as this would require vertical heat diffusivities large enough to give a nonphysically high value of convective heat transport...|$|R

As of 1988, observations ruled out any periodical variations attributable to massive planets around Tau Ceti inside of Jupiter-like distances. Ever-more precise measurements continue to rule out such planets, at least until December 2012. The velocity precision reached is about 11m/s measured over a five-year time span.
