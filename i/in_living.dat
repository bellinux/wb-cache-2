5|$|<b>In</b> <b>living</b> systems, {{selenium}} {{is found}} in the amino acids selenomethionine, selenocysteine, and methylselenocysteine. In these compounds, selenium plays a role analogous to that of sulfur. Another naturally occurring organoselenium compound is dimethyl selenide.|$|E

5|$|Saadanius had {{a longer}} face than living catarrhines, more closely {{resembling}} New World monkeys in appearance, {{although it was}} larger—possibly {{the size of a}} gibbon. Its enlarged, deep-rooted canine teeth, the diastema (space) between its canine teeth and second incisors, and its sagittal crest (ridge of bone running lengthwise down the top of the skull) suggest that the specimen was a male. These features are shared among male Old World monkeys. Saadanius lacks the advanced frontal sinus found <b>in</b> <b>living</b> catarrhines, but it does possess an ectotympanic, or bony ear tube, found <b>in</b> <b>living</b> catarrhines. Propliopithecoids, the oldest stem group of catarrhines, which date back 35 to 30mya, lacked a fully developed ectotympanic.|$|E

50|$|As of the 2010 Census the Penns Valley {{area had}} 12,819 people <b>living</b> <b>in</b> the area.

5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} improved, median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not improved. Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth <b>in</b> <b>living</b> standards.|$|E
5|$|Although the B-DNA form is {{most common}} under the {{conditions}} found in cells, {{it is not}} a well-defined conformation but a family of related DNA conformations that occur at the high hydration levels present <b>in</b> <b>living</b> cells.

5|$|Group 3 {{elements}} are generally hard metals with low aqueous solubility, and have low availability to the biosphere. No group 3 element has any documented biological role <b>in</b> <b>living</b> organisms.

5|$|In 1952, Alan Turing (1912–1954), {{better known}} {{for his work on}} {{computing}} and codebreaking, wrote The Chemical Basis of Morphogenesis, an analysis of the mechanisms that would be needed to create patterns <b>in</b> <b>living</b> organisms, in the process called morphogenesis. He predicted oscillating chemical reactions, in particular the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction. These activator-inhibitor mechanisms can, Turing suggested, generate patterns of stripes and spots in animals, and contribute to the spiral patterns seen in plant phyllotaxis.|$|E
5|$|In biology, natural {{selection}} {{can cause the}} development of patterns <b>in</b> <b>living</b> things for several reasons, including camouflage, sexual selection, and different kinds of signalling, including mimicry and cleaning symbiosis. In plants, the shapes, colours, and patterns of insect-pollinated flowers like the lily have evolved to attract insects such as bees. Radial patterns of colours and stripes, some visible only in ultraviolet light serve as nectar guides {{that can be seen}} at a distance.|$|E
