40|$|The Asia Pacific {{countries}} are both major suppliers and consumers {{of fish and}} fishery products. In the past decade, {{there has been a}} worldwide trend towards demanding safer food and thus a more stringent control of food safety and quality. Governments as key players in food safety control systems have tightened up regulations and introduced new control systems that are applied to imported and exported products. Other players in the system such as industry, buyers and consumers have an increasing role in the control system. Those roles can be identified as monitoring, inspection, verification, audit and education. The purpose of the <b>fish</b> <b>inspection</b> and control system can be identified as providing safe food, increasing market access and protecting consumers. The system is usually based on end product analysis, certification of products and establishment registration. The approaches used are control of GMPs, sanitation, hygiene and HACCP. There are both voluntary and mandatory systems applied. Official bodies responsible for <b>fish</b> <b>inspection</b> and control in most cases involve more than one agency.

On 7 August 2015 the Faroese Court passed sentence upon five activists from Sea Shepherd for disturbing the pilot whale hunt in Bøur and Tórshavn on 23 July 2015. The judge found all five guilty in breaking the Grind law and they were fined 5,000 to 35,000 DKK and the Sea Shepherd Global was fined 75,000 DKK. The five Sea Shepherd activists appealed to the higher court, Østre Landsret, and the Public Prosecutor counter appealed. The case was treated in Østre Landsret in Tórshavn on 9 and 10 March 2016. One week later, on 17 March 2016 the court changed some of the sentences of the Faroese court, some were lowered and the one of 5,000 DKK was raised to 12,500 DKK.

The public prosecutor prepared another case against the Sea Shepherd, where the prosecutor says that people from Sea Shepherd had put several lives at risk, including a 10-year-old boy, two Faroese seamen and two police officers, by sailing recklessly in front of and across of the boats which were driving the pod of whales towards the beach, and colliding with a boat from the <b>fishing</b> <b>inspection</b> authorities.|$|R
40|$|The {{establishment}} of a fish quality control and of a <b>fish</b> <b>inspection</b> service {{has been one of}} the most important contributions of the UNDP/FAO assistance to the Mozambique Fishery Sector through many subsequent projects since 1993. The institutionalization of a national <b>fish</b> <b>inspection</b> service within the Secretariat of State for Fisheries (SEP) was only feasible following the approval of the Fisheries Law in 1991. The project provided assistance during the whole of 1992 for the setting up of the service central nucleus, definition of functions and responsibilities, and preparation of inspection regulations. At the same time, activities focused on training and preparation of training programmes for national staff in all technical, managerial and legal aspects to be applied to inspection/quality certification of products for export. In parallel, the project provided technical assistance to the artisanal fishery sector in the application of methods for fish processing and utilization for the domestic market, definition and quality standards for salted fish, preparation of audio-visual extension material.

Exports of Eritrean fishery products, {{for which}} the European Union is the largest market, has an {{important}} share in the socio-economic development of the country. It {{is very important to}} earn foreign currency and provide employment opportunities by encouraging local and foreign investors in the sector. The export of fish from Eritrea mainly targets markets of developed nations where food quality and safety standards are increasing rapidly. During the last decade there has been more focus on the application of more stringent quality and safety regulations according to international norms. This paper investigates the determinants of quality in global fish businesses. The paper provides an overview of all the factors that characterize international fish market regulations with special emphasis given to the EU markets. It also investigates the general quality and safety policies of the Eritrean Marine Products Company (EMPC).

40|$|Point cloud {{matching}} is {{a central}} problem in Object Modeling with applications in Computer Vision and Computer Graphics. Although the problem is well studied in the case when an initial estimate of the relative pose is known (fine matching), the problem becomes much more difficult when this a priori knowledge is not available (coarse matching). In this paper we introduce a novel technique to speed up coarse matching algorithms for point clouds. This new technique, called Hierarchical Normal Space Sampling (HNSS), extends Normal Space Sampling by grouping points hierarchically according to the distribution of their normal vectors. This hierarchy guides the search for corresponding points while staying free of user intervention. This permits to navigate through the huge search space taking advantage of geometric information and to stop when a sufficiently good initial pose is found. This initial pose can then {{be used as the}} starting point for any fine matching algorithm. Hierarchical Normal Space Sampling is adaptable to different searching strategies and shape descriptors.

Moreover, fish passage assessments could provide important knowledge regarding major causes and capabilities for fish migration (Lucas 2 ̆ 6 Baras, 2001; Roni, 2005). We collected particular spawning periods of freshwater native cyprinid species (Barbus graellsii, Barbus haasi, Barbus meridionalis, Parachondrostoma miegii, Squalius laietanus) from Catalonia between 1987 and 1990 (Casals, 2005), among other periods and species (Salmo trutta, Salaria fluviatilis), including no native species as well. We selected 5 fish pass assessments, at least, with good quality of river connectivity for fish (indicating {{that it allows}} {{the passage of the}} majority or all native fish species potentially present) carried out using methods which permit estimation of barrier effect on <b>fish</b> (direct <b>inspection</b> of <b>fish</b> pass facilities) at different river stretches and river basins from Catalonia (Fluvià, Ter and Ebre) between 2006 and 2014.

40|$|Illegal, unreported, and {{unregulated}} (IUU) fishing {{contributes to}} overexploitation of fisheries, harms {{the recovery of}} fish populations, and causes large financial losses, especially for coastal developing countries with economies heavily reliant on fishing. Illicit fishing operations also are often linked to other crimes, such as tax evasion, money laundering, smuggling, and violation of labour standards, each of which takes an additional toll. The Port State Measures Agreement (PSMA) is a cost-effective tool to combat IUU <b>fishing.</b> Port <b>inspections</b> are less expensive and safer than monitoring, pursuing, and inspecting vessels at sea. At the same time, inspections reduce the incentives for this illicit fishing because they {{make it more difficult}} to sell illegally caught fish. As more nations agree to abide by the treaty and harmonise their port State measures, IUU fishing will no longer be a lowrisk, high-reward business but a high-risk, low-reward enterprise. This is the FAO's ultimate goal for the PSMA. Becoming a party to this international agreement and implementing effective port State measures involves costs, but there are numerous direct and indirect economic benefits as well. At the core of the PSMA is the principle of cooperation; the benefits to individual nations will increase as more States join. Nations have had to make policy changes to implement PSMA requirements, but a review of what has been done so far by States that have ratified the agreement shows clear advantages as well.

40|$|Abstract—X-ray {{testing is}} playing an {{increasingly}} important role in food quality assurance. In the production of fish fillets, however, fish bone detection is performed by human operators using their sense of touch and vision {{which can lead to}} misclassification. In countries where fish is often consumed, fish bones {{are some of the most}} frequently ingested foreign bodies encountered in foods. Effective detection of fish bones in the quality control process would help avoid this problem. For this reason, we developed an X-ray machine vision approach to au-tomatically detect fish bones in fish fillets. This paper describes our approach and the corresponding validation experiments with salmon fillets. The approach consists of six steps: 1) A digital X-ray image is taken of the fish fillet being tested. 2) The X-ray image is filtered and enhanced to facilitate the detection of fish bones. 3) Potential fish bones in the image are segmented using band pass filtering, thresholding and morphological techniques. 4) Intensity features of the enhanced X-ray image are extracted from small detection windows that are defined in those regions where potential fish bones were segmented. 5) A classifier is used to discriminate between ‘bones ’ and ‘no-bones ’ classes in the detection windows. 6) Finally, fish bones in the X-ray image are isolated using morphological operations applied on the corresponding segments classified as ‘bones’. In the experiments we used a high resolution flat panel detector with the capacity to capture up to a 6 million pixel digital X-ray image. In the training phase, we analyzed 20 representative salmon fillets, 7700 detection windows (10 × 10 pixels) and 279 intensity features. Cross validation yielded a detection performance of 95 % using a support vector machine classifier with only 24 selected features. We believe that the proposed approach opens new possibilities in the field of automated visual inspection of salmon and other similar fish.

40|$|AbstractPresence of {{nitrofuran}} and chloramphenicol in farmed prawn {{and shrimp}} {{is a major}} concern in the export sector of Bangladesh. Rejections of consignments by the foreign buyers have been recurrent {{for the last couple of}} years due to detection of these banned antibiotics. The increasingly complex requirements for food safety assurance and traceability set by major export markets represent a threat to the trade of this significant sector. In this study, the status and trends of the presence of nitrofuran and chloramphenicol in freshwater prawn Macrobrachium rosenbergii (De Man) and marine shrimp Penaeus monodon (Fabricius) and in their feeds in the Southwest coastal region of Bangladesh were investigated. The prawn/shrimp farmers, feed manufacturers and feed sellers were interviewed with well structured pre-tested Questionnaires. Antibiotic residues present in the animal muscles, feeds and feed ingredients were detected using LC–MS–MS by the <b>Fish</b> <b>Inspection</b> and Quality Control Wing of the Department of Fisheries. The study reveals that farmers did not deliberately use those banned antibiotics, but these chemicals were detected in many M. rosenbergii and P. monodon samples in 2008, 2009 and 2010, in both fresh muscles, pre-export and post-export consignments. The percentage of contamination with this banned antibiotics in M. rosenbergii samples were 17. 74 %, 22. 89 %, 13. 60 % and in P. monodon samples were 12. 65 %, 15. 79 %, 11. 85 % in 2008, 2009 and 2010 respectively.

40|$|Shrimp {{culture in}} Bangladesh {{has emerged as}} an {{important}} aquaculture industry {{over the last three}} decades although its culture in greater parts of the farming area is done in traditional ways. In the meantime, the government of Bangladesh has taken necessary measures along with the private sectors to increase production, upgrade processing industries and to promote export performance. Long supply chain in raw material collection, inadequate infrastructure facilities, poor level of cool chain and lack of adequate HACCP-based training on hygiene and sanitation of different groups of people involved in the field level are the main problems of quality loss of raw materials. Shortage of raw materials results in poor capacity utilization of the processing plants. The growth of bagda (P. monodon) hatchery has expanded rapidly over the last few years, remaining mostly concentrated in Cox's Bazar region is enough to meet the target production. However, {{there is a shortage of}} pelleted shrimp feed in Bangladesh. A large number of export processors are now producing increasing amounts of value-added products such as individually quick-frozen, peeled and divined, butterfly cut shrimp, as well as cooked products. The export earnings from value added products is about half of the total export value. About 95 % of total fish products are exported to European countries, USA and Japan and the remaining to the Southeast Asia and the Middle East. Most of the EU approved shrimp processing industries have been upgraded with laboratory facilities and provided HACCP training to their workers. As of now, HACCP is applied on the processing plants, but to ensure the quality of raw materials and to reduce risks, shrimp farms are also required to adopt HACCP plan. There is increased pressure time to time from importing countries for fish processors to establish effective quality assurance system in processing plants. <b>Fish</b> <b>Inspection</b> and Quality Control (FIQC) of the Department of Fisheries while having moderately equipped laboratories with chemical, bio-chemical and microbiological testing facilities and qualified technical personnel, the creation of facilities for testing of antibiotics is underway. FIQC mainly supervises quality aspects of the processing plants and has little or no control over raw material supply chains from farm to processing plants. Bangladesh export consignments sometimes face rejection due to reported poor quality of the products. Three types of barriers are reported for export of shrimp to EU countries. These are:(1) government participation in trade and restrictive practices (state aid, countervailing duties, state trading enterprises, government monopoly practices), customs and administrative entry procedures (anti-dumping duties, customs valuation, classification, formalities, rules of origin); (2) technical barriers to trade or TBT (technical regulations, standards, testing, certification arrangement); (3) specific limitations (quantitative restrictions, import licensing, embargoes, exchange control, discriminatory sourcing, export restraints, measures to regulate domestic prices, requirements concerning marking, labeling and packaging) ...|$|E
40|$|This work {{proposes a}} system for {{long-term}} mapping and localization based on the Feature Stability Histogram (FSH) model which is an innovative feature management approach {{able to cope with}} changing environments. FSH is built using a voting schema, where re-observed features are promoted; otherwise the feature progressively decreases its corresponding FSH value. FSH is inspired by the human memory model. This model introduces concepts of Short-Term Memory (STM), which retains information long enough to use it, and Long-Term Memory (LTM), which retains information for longer periods of time. If the entries in STM are continuously rehearsed, they become part of LTM. However, this work proposes a change in the pipeline of this model, allowing any feature to be part of STM or LTM depending on the feature strength. FSH stores the stability values of local features, stable features are only used for localization and mapping. Experimental validation of the FSH model was conducted using the FastSLAM framework and a long-term dataset collected during a period of one year at different environmental conditions. The experiments carried out include qualitative and quantitative results such as: filtering out dynamic objects, increasing map accuracy, scalability, and reducing the data association effort in long-term runThis work has been partially supported by the project RAIMON—Autonomous Underwater Robot for Marine <b>Fish</b> Farms <b>Inspection</b> and Monitoring (Ref.

40|$|Fort McCoy {{biologists}} {{are concerned}} with emerging and invasive pathogens that could colonize fish within {{the waters of the}} military installation. An infectious disease, parasite and diet survey was conducted to document the presence of any invasive species and to establish a baseline of fish parasite communities of brook trout, brown trout, bluegill, largemouth bass, and white suckers. Fish (n = 497) were collected from 10 study sites at Fort McCoy and screened for target pathogens according to the procedures outlined in the AFS Blue Book <b>Fish</b> Health Section <b>Inspection</b> Manual. Parasite and diet data were collected on a sub-sample (n = 10 - 14) of each fish species from each sample site. No target viral or bacterial pathogens were detected. A total of 6, 089 parasites were recovered representing 26 genera. Prevalence of infection ranged from 33 % to 100 % in each fish host. Two new host records were reported. Results indicated host density, water size, diet and sampling time appeared {{to play a role in}} structuring the parasite communities at Fort McCoy Military Installatio...|$|R
40|$|Responses of rainbowfish (Melanotaenia duboulayi) {{from two}} populations towards a) {{an active and}} a passive predatory fish and b) a novel trawl apparatus, were compared. Predator-sympatric fish avoided the fish predators and showed {{stronger}} avoidance behaviour {{in response to the}} active predator. These <b>fish</b> used predator <b>inspection</b> excursions to rapidly assess the potential risk and their escape responses were consistently effective. In contrast the predator-naive fish ignored the passive predator but were continually drawn towards the active predator possibly due to generalized curiosity and the absence of significant negative feedback from the predator, which was restrained by a clear Perspex partition. Despite this attraction, the predator-naive fish did not display typical predator inspection behaviour and showed very poor escape performance when initially confronted by the trawl apparatus. Many of these fish, however, showed rapid improvement in their escape performance through learning. These results suggest that predator-sympatric rainbowfish have the capacity to assess the level of threat posed by a predator and predator-naive rainbowfish learn to implement appropriate escape strategies when forced to evade a threat...|$|R
