5|$|In the {{majority}} of cases the damage results from physical trauma such as car accidents, gunshots, falls, or sports injuries, but it can also result from nontraumatic causes such as infection, insufficient blood flow, and tumors. Efforts to prevent SCI include individual measures such as using safety equipment, societal measures such as safety regulations in sports and traffic, and improvements to equipment. Known since ancient times to be a catastrophic injury and long believed to be untreatable, SCI has seen great improvements in its care since the middle of the 20th century. Treatment of spinal cord injuries starts with stabilizing the spine and controlling inflammation to prevent further damage. Other interventions needed can vary widely depending on the location and extent of the injury, from bed rest to surgery. In many cases, spinal cord injuries require substantial, long-term physical and occupational therapy in rehabilitation, especially if they interfere with activities of daily living. Research into new treatments for spinal cord injuries includes stem cell implantation, <b>engineered</b> <b>materials</b> for tissue support, and wearable robotic exoskeletons.|$|E

2500|$|Avinor {{installed}} a [...] long section of <b>engineered</b> <b>materials</b> arrestor {{system at the}} end of each runway in 2012. Kjevik is the only airport in Norway with this system, as the proximity to vulnerable marine environment prohibits the creation of a conventional safety zone around the runways. The south end was installed in July and the north end later in the year. The installations cost between 70 and 80 million Norwegian krone. The control tower from 1966 was not sufficiently high to give the air traffic controllers full view of the runway. A new [...] tall control tower was therefore opened on 3 June 2013.|$|E
2500|$|McCarran International Airport, Las Vegas, Nevada to Burbank-Glendale-Pasadena Airport, Burbank, California, that overran {{the runway}} during landing on March 5, 2000. The aircraft, a Boeing 737-3T5, {{registration}} [...] {{came to rest}} on a city street adjacent to a gas station. The National Transportation Safety Board found that the incident was due to the pilots attempting to land with excessive speed. They also blamed the air traffic controller for placing them in a position from which their only option was a go around. Two of the flight attendants were seriously injured, and there were many minor injuries. As a result of the incident, the airport installed an <b>Engineered</b> <b>Materials</b> Arrestor System (EMAS) at the east end of the incident runway.|$|E
2500|$|It is now {{recommended}} practice for any new runway {{to have a}} clear area at least [...] long at each end, called a 'runway safety area', to allow additional space for an aircraft that overruns the runway to decelerate and stop in relative safety. [...] As Midway was constructed before these rules were put in place, it does not have this safety area. The accident renewed debates on the need for, and feasibility of, an <b>engineered</b> <b>materials</b> arrestor system, or EMAS, at Chicago Midway, given the lack of adequate overrun areas, and the surrounding residential neighborhoods. Additionally, actions taken by the city to acquire land for a buffer zone around the airport (in apparent recognition of the hazard) came to light after the crash. In 2007, installation began on modified, short-length arrestor beds. The first one was completed at the end of Runway 31C by summer 2007. EMAS beds have also been installed at the end of 04R, 13C and 22L.|$|E

5000|$|An <b>engineered</b> <b>materials</b> {{arrestor}} system, <b>engineered</b> <b>materials</b> arresting system (EMAS), or {{arrester bed}} is {{a bed of}} <b>engineered</b> <b>materials</b> built {{at the end of}} a runway to reduce the risk of a runway excursion. <b>Engineered</b> <b>materials</b> are defined in FAA Advisory Circular No 150/5220-22B as [...] "high energy absorbing materials of selected strength, which will reliably and predictably crush under the weight of an aircraft". While the current technology involves lightweight, crushable concrete blocks, any material that has been approved to meet the FAA Advisory Circular can be used for an EMAS. The purpose of an EMAS is to stop an aircraft overrun with no human injury and minimal aircraft damage. The aircraft is slowed by the loss of energy required to crush the EMAS material. An EMAS is similar in concept to the runaway truck ramp made of gravel or sand. It is intended to stop an aircraft that has overshot a runway when there is an insufficient free space for a standard runway safety area (RSA). Multiple patents have been issued on the construction and design on the materials and process.|$|E
