40|$|Projection factors {{based on}} {{production}} {{on the last}} day of sampling were developed for dairy goat milk and fat records. The 305 -day lactation was divided into 13 stages varying from 10 to 40 days. The shortest stages were in early lactation. Sets of factors were developed for four ages at freshening, two seasons, two levels of herd production, and two breed groups. These classifications were necessary to avoid bias and improve accuracy. Cumulative yield factors also were developed with the same grouping of records. These factors are used when production for the last sample <b>day</b> is <b>not</b> <b>available...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} large baseline bistatic (LBB) techniques testable by the SABRINA (System for Advanced Bistatic and Radar Interferometric Application) {{mission and}} never experimented previously from two spaceborne platforms. The adjective ‘large’ does not identify a specific baseline length, but it simply remarks that phase coherence between bistatic and monostatic echoes is vanished. In a LBB observation geometry different techniques can be experimented, therefore {{a great number}} of applications can be envisaged: topography, target velocity measurements, sea wave spectra definition, bistatic radar cross section investigation, improvement of monostatic data image quality. The main features of LBB observation geometry more suitable for the application of the proposed techniques are also outlined. SABRINA is the sole scheduled mission aiming to conduct a systematic experimentation of the possible large baseline bistatic applications. The first great result of the LBB part of the mission could be the creation of an established database for bistatic scattering of both natural scenes and artificial targets, that at the present <b>day</b> is <b>not</b> <b>available</b> yet...|$|R
40|$|The {{distribution}} of standard time signals via AM and FM broadcasting stations presents the distinct advantages {{to offer a}} wide area coverage and to allow the use of inexpensive receivers, but the signals are radiated {{a limited number of}} times per <b>day,</b> are <b>not</b> usually <b>available</b> during the night, and no full and automatic synchronization of a remote clock is possible. As an attempt to overcome some of these problems, a time coded signal with a complete date information is diffused by the IEN via the national broadcasting networks in Italy. These signals are radiated by some 120 AM and about 3000 FM and TV transmitters around the country. In such a way, a time ordered system with an accuracy of a couple of milliseconds is easily achieved...|$|R
40|$|International audienceSatellite data, {{with their}} spatial and {{temporal}} coverage, are particularly well suited for the analysis and characterization of space-time-varying relationships between geophysical processes. We investigate here the forecasting of a geophysical variable using both satellite observations and model outputs. As example we study the daily concentration of mineral suspended particulate matters estimated from satellite-derived datasets, in coastal waters adjacent to the French Gironde River mouth. We forecast this high resolution dataset using environmental data (wave height, wind strength and direction, tides and river outflow) and four multi-latent-regime models: homogeneous and non-homogeneous Markov-switching models, with and without an autoregressive term, i. e. the suspended matter concentration observed the day before. We clearly show, using a validation dataset, significant improvements with multi-regime models compared to a classical multi-regression and a state-of-the-art non-linear model (Support Vector Regression (SVR) model). The best results are reported for a mixture of 3 regimes for autoregressive model using non-homogeneous transitions. With the autoregressive models, we obtain at day+ 1 forecasting performances of 93 % of the explained variance for the mixture model compared to 83 % for a standard linear model and 85 % using a SVR. These improvements are even {{more important for the}} non-autoregressive models. These results stress the potential of the identification of geophysical regimes to improve the forecasting or the inversion. We also show that for short periods of lack of observations (typically lesser than 15 days), non-homogeneous transition probabilities and estimated autoregressive term, the observation of the previous <b>day</b> <b>not</b> being <b>available,</b> help to enhance forecasting performances...|$|R
40|$|The {{synchrotron}} of the Heidelberg Heavy-Ion Therapy-Centre (HIT) accelerates ions to {{the energies}} required for therapy purposes. In its fast ramped normal-conducting magnets effects like hysteresis and eddy currents occur. This requires time and energy-consuming {{processes in the}} present magnet-by-current control to deliver beams with well-defined energy and spatial focus to the treatment rooms. These additional processes could be avoided by a magnet-by-field control which could improve {{the efficiency of the}} facility by up to 30 %. In the frame of the here-presented work the complete HIT-synchrotron was implemented in the simulation program MAD-X to study the relevant magnet parameter range. In addition, a study on the general feasibility of this novel control principle was carried out with the simulation suite OPERA 3 D, allowing for determining possible sensor positions. As the accelerator is in operation 24 h per <b>day</b> and thus <b>not</b> <b>available</b> for test measurements, an external test bench was designed and built up in the frame of this thesis. This setup was used for analysis and comparison of a number of commercially available Hall-sensors. Based on these results, a sensor for the magnet-by-field control at HIT was selected...|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Two novel agents, dabigatran and rivaroxaban, {{recently}} gained market {{authorisation for}} prevention of venous thromboembolism (VTE) after hip and knee arthroplasty. However, safety {{data of the}} new oral anticoagulants with a long-term use of 42 <b>days</b> are <b>not</b> <b>available</b> for total knee arthroplasty (TKA). Furthermore, there are no clinical trials comparing dabigatran and/or rivaroxaban with nadroparin, which is used in most Dutch departments of orthopaedic surgery. Our aim is to compare the 42 -day use of dabigatran and rivaroxaban versus nadroparin after TKA in a clinical explorative pilot study by assessing the incidence of major bleeding and clinically relevant non-major bleeding using a standardised model of bleeding definitions. Methods and analysis: A randomised open-label pilot study was conducted. Patients >= 18 years and weighing more than 40 kg who were scheduled for a primary elective TKA were included. Patients {{were randomly assigned to}} three groups. Patients took either a daily oral dose of dabigatran etexilate 220 mg (n= 50), 10 mg of oral rivaroxaban (n= 50) or subcutaneous nadroparin 0. 3 ml (n= 50) for 42 days. The primary safety outcome measure was the incidence of bleeding events. Major bleeding events and clinically relevant non-major bleeding events were defined according to accepted guidelines. The secondary measures of this study were the occurrence of VTE, time until the bleeding event, compliance, duration of hospital stay, rehospitalisation, outpatient clinic visits and interventions following complications. Additionally, coagulation monitoring, knee flexion range of motion and Knee injury and Osteoarthritis Outcome Score were evaluated. Dissemination: The results of this trial provided insight into the validity of design for an adequately powered multicentre study investigating the safety of the new oral anticoagulants compared with nadroparin, an anticoagulant applied for prevention of VTE after knee arthroplasty in the Dutch situation. ...|$|R

40|$|Often daily {{prices on}} {{different}} markets {{are not all}} observable. The question is whether we should exclude from modelling the <b>days</b> with prices <b>not</b> <b>available</b> on all markets (thus loosing some information and implicitly modifying the time axis) or somehow complete the missing (non-existing) prices. In order to compare the effects of each of two {{ways of dealing with}} partly available data, one should consider formal procedures of replacing the unavailable prices by their appropriate predictions. We propose a fully Bayesian approach, which amounts to obtaining the marginal posterior (or predictive) distribution for any particular day in question. This procedure takes into account uncertainty on missing prices and can be used to check validity of informal ways of "completing " the data (e. g. linear interpolation). We use the MSF-SBEKK structure, the simplest among hybrid MSV-MGARCH models, which can parsimoniously describe volatility {{of a large number of}} prices or indices. In order to conduct Bayesian inference, the conditional posterior distributions for all unknown quantities are derived and the Gibbs sampler (with Metropolis-Hastings steps) is designed. Our approach is applied to daily prices from six different financial and commodity markets; the data cover the period from December 21, 2005 till September 30, 2011, so the time of the global financial crisis is included. We compare inferences (on individual parameters, conditional correlation coefficients and volatilities), obtained in the cases where incomplete observations are either deleted or forecasted...|$|R
