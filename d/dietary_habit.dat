500|$|The backcountry {{relied heavily}} on a diet based on mush made from soured milk or boiled grains. Clabber, a yogurt-like food made with soured milk, was a {{standard}} breakfast dish and was eaten by backcountry settlers of all ages. This <b>dietary</b> <b>habit</b> was not shared by other British immigrant groups and was equally despised by those still in Britain. The Anglican missionary Charles Woodmason, who spent time among Ulster Irish immigrants, described them as depending [...] "wholly on butter, milk, clabber and what in England is given to hogs". Oatmeal mush was a popular meal in the British borderlands and remained popular in America. The only difference was that the oatmeal was replaced by corn, and is still known today in the South as grits. Cakes of unleavened dough baked on bakestones or circular griddles were common and went by names such as [...] "clapbread", [...] "griddle cakes" [...] and [...] "pancakes". While the potato had originated in South America, it did not become established in North America until it {{was brought to the}} colonies by northern British settlers in the 18th century and became an important backcountry staple along with corn. Pork had been a food taboo among northern Britons and the primary meat had been sheep. In the American colonies the raising of sheep was not as efficient and mutton was therefore replaced with pork. The habit of eating [...] "sallet" [...] or [...] "greens" [...] remained popular, but the vegetables of the Old World were replaced with plants like squashes, gourds, beans, corn, land cress, and pokeweed.

40|$|Background and Objectives: Proper {{nutrition}} has {{a significant}} role in prevention of chronic disease and health promotion. Psychological factors {{play an important role in}} making food choices and subsequently <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> and in this context, personality is considered as a key factor. The present study was performed with the purpose of determining the correlation between personality traits and <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> in female students. Methods: The present research was conducted as a descriptive-correlational study on 224 female students aged 18 - 30 years in Ahvaz Jundishapur University of Medical Sciences (2013 - 2014). Personality traits (neuroticism, extraversion, openness to experience, agreeableness, and conscientiousness) were assessed using NEO Five-Factor Inventory and <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> were were assessed by a <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> questionnaire containing 20 questions about <b>dietary</b> <b>habits.</b> Data were analyzed using Pearson's correlation coefficient and stepwise regression test. The significance level was considered to be p< 0. 05. Results: In this study, high neuroticism and openness were correlated with low score of <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> (p< 0. 01). Higher level of conscientiousness was significantly correlated with high score of <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> (p< 0. 01). Based on the stepwise regression analysis, personality traits can predict the score of <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> (p< 0. 01). Conclusion: The results of this study revealed that neuroticism and openness are correlated with unhealthy <b>dietary</b> <b>habits,</b> and conscientiousness is correlated with healthy <b>dietary</b> <b>habits.</b> Therefore, appropriate nutritional educations based on the personality traits of students are recommended to modify dietary patterns and prevent chronic diseases...|$|R

50|$|Japan {{initially}} received Chinese Buddhism in 6th century. In the 9th century, Emperor Saga made {{a decree}} prohibiting meat consumption except fish and birds. This remained the <b>dietary</b> <b>habit</b> of Japanese until {{the introduction of}} European dietary customs in the 19th century. Again around the 9th century, two Japanese monks (Kūkai and Saichō) introduced Vajrayana Buddhism into Japan and this soon became the dominant Buddhism among the nobility. In particular, Saichō, who founded the Tendai sect of Japanese Buddhism, {{reduced the number of}} vinaya code to 66. (Enkai 円戒) During the 12th century, a number of monks from Tendai sects founded new schools (Zen, Pure Land) and de-emphasised vegetarianism, Nichiren Buddhism today likewise de-emphasises vegetarianism. However, Nichiren himself practiced vegetarianism. Zen does tend generally to look favourably upon vegetarianism. The Shingon sect founded by Kūkai recommends vegetarianism and requires it at certain times, but it is not always strictly required for monks and nuns.|$|E
50|$|The Rajbongshi {{community}} had traditionally been a largely agricultural community, cultivating mainly rice, pulses and maize. Rice is the staple {{food for the}} majority of the population. Even in the 21st century, a large portion of this community still adhere to a rural lifestyle, though urbanization is on constant rise. The food consumed and the diet pattern is not very different from those in other parts of Bengal. Rice and Pulses are consumed on regular basis along with vegetables and bhajis (fries- mainly potatoes). Typical is the Dhékir sāg and naphā sāg, two types of vegetable preparation, mostly boiled with very little added oil, out of newly-born shoots of fern leaves. In lower Assam, a vegetable preparation of bamboo shoots is also consumed. Consumption of stale rice or pantha bhāt is common within Rajbongshi community. Cooking is mainly done using mustard oil, though sunflower oil is sometimes used. As far as non-vegetarian foods are concerned, the Rajbongshi population consumes a large amount of meat and eggs unlike other neighborhood populations from Bengal region, who consume large amount of fish. goat meat and sheep (if available) is generally consumed, and consumption of fowl meat is discouraged, especially by the older generations, though such barriers now cease to exist. Eggs of Ducks and poultry are consumed. Fish is also consumed but not in very large number. The rivers of northern Bengal does not sustain large varieties of fishes because of its non-perennial nature. However, in lower Assam areas, large rivers like the Brahmaputra sustain large varieties of fish which becomes an important part of the <b>dietary</b> <b>habit</b> of the Rajbongshis living there.|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background During {{the last}} decades, global {{migration}} has increased and many immigrant groups {{have a higher}} prevalence than the native born population of several cardiovascular disease risk factors, including poor <b>dietary</b> <b>habits.</b> However, it is uncertain if <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> in immigrant populations reflect <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> in {{their country of origin}} or if the current diet is a consequence of the migration and possible change of <b>dietary</b> <b>habits.</b> The aim {{of this study was to}} examine possible dietary differences between elderly Iranians living in Stockholm, Sweden with elderly Iranians living in Tehran, Iran, taking into account sex, age, marital status, and education. Methods Dietary intakes were assessed by semi - quantitative food frequency questionnaire in a cross-sectional study of 121 Iranians living in Stockholm and 52 Iranians living in Tehran, aged 60 - 80. Differences in <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> between the two groups was analysed by bootstrapped regression analyses with 1000 replications. Results Iranians living in Sweden had significantly higher intake of protein, total fat, fiber than Iranians living in Iran, but lower consumption of carbohydrates. The observed differences in intake of macronutrients were reflected in consumed amount of all food items, which were higher among Iranians living in Iran with the exception of bread and grain consumption which was lower. Conclusions There are general differences in <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> between Iranians living in Iran and Iranians living in Sweden. Parts of observed differences in <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> may reflect a favourable adoption process to the Swedish <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> after migration. Meanwhile other differences are point of concern in light of the high prevalence of overweight, among Iranians living in Sweden and can have unfavourable impact in particular in the context of cardiovascular health. </p...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The {{objective}} of this research {{study was to examine}} the relationship between BMI, physical activity, <b>dietary</b> <b>habits,</b> and student demographic factors (age, ethnicity, income, immigration, and sex). Given the association between overweight and obesity and the inequitable burden of chronic health conditions among ethnic minority populations, a deeper understanding of the socioeconomic, gender, age, and racial/ethnic variation in BMI, physical activity, and <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> is needed. The shifting demographics of urban college populations make urban college campuses an important setting for addressing the lifetime health needs of ethnically diverse urban populations. Methods In this cross-sectional non-experimental study, we used validated self-report questionnaires to survey 1, 184 students about their <b>dietary</b> <b>habits,</b> physical activity, and BMI. Measures included self-reported <b>dietary</b> <b>habits,</b> physical activity, BMI and demographics (age, ethnicity, income, immigrant status, and sex). Results Hispanics and Non-Hispanic Blacks were more likely to be at higher risk for increased BMI, less weekly hours of physical activity, and more unhealthy <b>dietary</b> <b>habits.</b> Female students were at a higher risk of less weekly physical activity. Older age was associated with increased BMI and more healthy <b>dietary</b> <b>habits.</b> Students attending colleges with a predominantly Hispanic student population (Campus B) and a predominantly Black student population (Campus C) had significantly higher BMIs than those attending an ethnically diverse college (Campus A). Immigrants had a lower average BMI and reported consuming less unhealthy foods than non-immigrants. In addition, immigrants from Europe and Asia had a lower BMI and engaged in more healthy <b>dietary</b> <b>habits</b> when compared to immigrants from the Caribbean, Africa, and Central and South America.
