50|$|The key {{interface}} {{in these}} architectures is {{that between the}} <b>femtocell</b> access points and the <b>femtocell</b> gateway. Standardisation enables a wider choice of <b>femtocell</b> products {{to be used with}} any gateway, increasing competitive pressure and driving costs down. For the common WCDMA femtocells, this is defined as the Luh interface. In the Luh architecture, the <b>femtocell</b> gateway sits between the <b>femtocell</b> and the core network and performs the necessary translations to ensure the femtocells appear as a radio network controller to existing mobile switching centres (MSCs). Each <b>femtocell</b> talks to the <b>femtocell</b> gateway and <b>femtocell</b> gateways talk to the Core Network Elements (CNE) (MSC for circuit-switched calls, SGSN for packet-switched calls). This model was proposed by 3GPP and the Femto Forum. New protocols (HNBAP Node B Application Part and RUA User Adaptation) have been derived; HNBAP is used for the control signaling between the HNB and HNB-GW while RUA is a lightweight mechanism to replace the SCCP and M3UA protocols in the RNC; its primary function is transparent transfer of RANAP messages.|$|E
5000|$|The {{most common}} form of small cells are <b>femtocells.</b> They were {{initially}} designed for residential and small business use, with a short range and a limited number of channels. <b>Femtocells</b> with increased range and capacity spawned a proliferation of terms: metrocells, metro <b>femtocells,</b> public access <b>femtocells,</b> enterprise <b>femtocells,</b> super femtos, Class 3 femto, greater femtos and microcells. The term [...] "small cells" [...] is frequently used by analysts and the industry as an umbrella to describe the different implementations of <b>femtocells,</b> and to clear up any confusion that <b>femtocells</b> are limited to residential uses.

However, the dense deployment of <b>femtocells</b> face the main challenge of co channel interference with macrocell users. In this paper, this interference problem is addressed by proposing a novel downlink power control algorithm for <b>femtocells.</b> The proposed algorithm gradually reduces the downlink transmit power of <b>femtocells</b> {{when they are}} informed about a nearby macrocell user under interference. This information {{is given to the}} <b>femtocells</b> by the macrocell base station through a unidirectional downlink broadcast channel.

Though the HUEs in the outer <b>femtocells</b> suffer downlink interference from eNBs, the gain of larger bandwidth in outer <b>femtocells</b> surpasses the drawback of interference such that outer <b>femtocells</b> can still achieve higher downlink capacity with co-channel spectrum usage. Thus, the interference scenario IV has been mitigated with hybrid spectrum arrangement.|$|R

50|$|In most cases, {{the user}} must then declare which mobile phone numbers {{are allowed to}} connect to his <b>femtocell,</b> usually via a web {{interface}} provided by the MNO.

Most MNOs provide a way for the user to know this has happened, for example by having a different network name appear on the mobile phone. All communications will then automatically go through the <b>femtocell.</b> When the user leaves the <b>femtocell</b> coverage (whether in a call or not) area, his phone hands over seamlessly to the macro network.

The Long Term Evolution (LTE) standard was designed to provide these mobile users with a better throughput, coverage and a lower latency. This thesis studies a specific area in Heterogeneous Networks; the subject of <b>femtocells.</b> The aim of <b>femtocells</b> is to provide better indoor coverage so as to allow users to benefit from higher data rates while reducing the load on the macro cell. <b>Femtocells</b> were proposed for Long Term Evolution (LTE) for indoor coverage.

30|$|In this study, {{a network}} is {{considered}} {{that consists of}} a macro base station (BS), terminals that are served via the macro BS and <b>femtocells</b> that are distributed within the coverage area of the macro BS. At some point, the macro BS faces congestion issues due to the high traffic from the terminals. The proposed solution is to offload an amount of the traffic to the <b>femtocells</b> {{through the creation of}} an ON among <b>femtocells</b> and terminals. The target is to specify the minimum transmission power of the <b>femtocells</b> that is needed to cover the terminals. Therefore, two approaches are presented. The dynamic resource allocation (DRA) algorithm that allocates power levels to <b>femtocells</b> in order to acquire as much traffic as possible from the macro BS, and the energy-efficient resource allocation (ERA) that selects the minimum number of <b>femtocells</b> and the minimum power level that are required to cover specific number of terminals. Due to the fact that terminals will be offloaded to the <b>femtocells,</b> the BS will serve fewer terminals and therefore the power consumption will be reduced leading to savings in operational expenditure. In addition, users will experience higher QoS since a part of the terminals will be offloaded to the <b>femtocells,</b> while the remaining terminals will be served by the BS that will have solved its congestion issues.|$|R

In particular, as soon as a macro BS faces congestion issues, nearby <b>femtocells</b> are exploited in order to acquire a proportion of the BS’s terminals. <b>Femtocells</b> and terminals create an ON relieving the problematic BS. The complex optimization problem that raised is mathematically formulated and solved by two algorithms. The first one, namely the DRA can be utilized by the operators that prefer to serve as many terminals as possible by <b>femtocells.</b> The second one, namely the ERA, selects only the <b>femtocells</b> that are needed to cover specific terminals and assigns to the <b>femtocells</b> the minimum possible power-level.

For successful deployment of <b>femtocells</b> in the pre-existing macrocell networks, there are some challenges such as the cell planning for interference management, handoff, and power control. In this paper, we focus on frequency planning which can provide interference avoidance for the co-existence of macrocells and <b>femtocells.</b> We propose a novel frequency planning for <b>femtocells</b> in cellular networks using fractional frequency reuse (FFR). We consider downlink performance of cellular systems based on Orthogonal Frequency Division Multiplexing Access (OFDMA), e. g., WiMAX and 3 GPP Long Term Evaluation (LTE). Simulation results show that our scheme indeed reduces the effect of additional co-channel interference (CCI) between a given macrocell and deployed <b>femtocells</b> as well as neighboring macrocells. ...|$|R
