50|$|With {{the above}} topographic, climatic and soil settings, the {{vegetation}} types which cover the park are categorized under five broad types of open combretaceous shrub savanna, anogeissus leiocarpus woodland, lannea humilis open <b>grass</b> <b>savanna,</b> acacia seyal tree savanna and Yaéré floodplains with perennial grasses. In the desert conditions, with no perennial streams {{flowing through the}} park area, there are no perennial grasses in the park. The water holes are created for animals. The combretaceous shrub savanna consist of Sclerocarya birrea tree savanna, Combretum and Terminalia shrubs and the doum palm Hyphaene thebaica. The Anogeissus leiocarpus woodland is in sandy soils with Mitragyna inermis in pockets near temporary water bodies. Lannea humilis are open <b>grass</b> <b>savanna</b> combined with short annual grasses. Patches of trees and stands of Mitragyna inermis are also reported from small islands near temporary water bodies. In this condition, vegetation reported are in the formations of compact clay. However, the area is very saline due to high evaporation. The fourth category of vegetation comprises Acacia seyal tree savanna growing in black clay soils which gets highly saturated during the rainy months; grasses in these conditions spread very slowly or may even dry up. The last type of vegetation is reported in the Yaéré flood plains, an important area to maintain perennial grasses in the park. The grasses reported are: Vetiveria nigritana, Oryza barthii, Echinochloa pyramidalis and Echinochloa stagnina and a few herbaceous legumes with Sesbania pachycarpa. However, in these conditions, {{where there are no}} trees, forest fires are common. A particular feature in the central and western parts of the park was that substantial areas were of annual grasses and herbs, interspersed by Acacia seyal shrublands. They were subject to seasonal flooding before the construction of the Maga dam.|$|E

This misuse also resulted in degradation of the ecosystem of rare plants and animals. It reached a chronic stage when indigenous multilayered plant communities became extinct in several areas with resultant creation of open fields, shrubs or <b>grass</b> <b>savanna</b> of least value. Thus, degradation of the ecologically rich system necessitated intervention at the Government level through enabling legislation to stop further damage to the ecosystem.

The rules enacted clearly defined that [...] "clearance of wood and shrubs is not allowed within 25 m at both sides of any waterway (article 28).

50|$|Sparse {{trees and}} savanna are forests with lower canopy cover of trees. They occur principally {{in areas of}} {{transition}} from forested to non-forested landscapes. The two major zones in which these ecosystems occur are in the boreal region and in the seasonally dry tropics. At high latitudes, north of the main zone of boreal forest, growing conditions are not adequate to maintain a continuous closed forest cover, so tree cover is both sparse and discontinuous. This vegetation is variously called open taiga, open lichen woodland, and forest tundra. A savanna is a mixed woodland grassland ecosystem characterized by the trees being sufficiently widely spaced so that the canopy does not close. The open canopy allows sufficient light to reach the ground to support an unbroken herbaceous layer consisting primarily of <b>grasses.</b> <b>Savannas</b> maintain an open canopy despite a high tree density.|$|R

40|$|International audienceAim This study {{calibrates}} {{the relationship}} between phytolith indices, modern vegetation structure, and a climate parameter (AET/PET, i. e. the ratio of annual actual evapotranspiration to annual potential evapotranspiration), in order to present new proxies for long-term Quaternary climate and vegetation changes, and model/data comparisons. Location Sixty-two modern soil surface samples from West Africa (Mauritania and Senegal), collected along a latitudinal transect across four bioclimatic zones, were analysed. Methods Two phytolith indices are defined as normalized data: (1) humidity-aridity index [Iph (%) = saddle vs. cross + dumbbell + saddle], and (2) water stress index [fan-shaped index (Fs) (%) = fan-shaped vs. sum of characteristic phytoliths]. Vegetation structures are delimited according to Iph and Fs boundaries. Bootstrapped regression methods are used for evaluating the strength of {{the relationship between}} the two phytolith indices and AET/PET. Additional modern phytolith assemblages, from Mexico, Cameroon and Tanzania are extracted in order to test the calibration established from the West African samples. Accuracy of the AET/PET phytolith proxy is compared with equivalent pollen proxy from the same area. Results Characterization of the grass cover is accurately made through Iph. A boundary of 20 +/- 1. 4 % discriminates tall <b>grass</b> <b>savannas</b> from short <b>grass</b> <b>savannas.</b> Water stress and transpiration experienced by the grass cover can be estimated through Fs. AET/PET is accurately estimated from phytoliths by a transfer function: AET/PET = - 0. 605 Fs - 0. 387 Iph + 0. 272 (Iph - 20) (2) (r = 0. 80 +/- 0. 04) in the application domain (AET/PET ranging from 0. 1 +/- 0. 04 to 0. 45 +/- 0. 04). Phytolith and pollen estimate with similar precision (r(pollen) = 0. 84 +/- 0. 04) the AET/PET in the studied area. Conclusions This study demonstrates that we can rely on the phytolith indices Iph and Fs to distinguish the different grasslands in tropical areas. Moreover, a new phytolith proxy of AET/PET, linked to water availability, is presented. We suggest from these results that combining phytolith and pollen proxies of AET/PET would help to constrain this climate parameter better, especially when phytolith assemblages are dominated by Panicoideae and Chloridoideae C- 4 -grass phytoliths, are devoid of Pooideae C- 3 -grass phytoliths, and occur with a few tropical ligneous woody dicotyledon phytoliths.

We, first, estimate the amount of rainfall required for trees and grasses under a certain atmospheric condition. Here, the variation of rainfall is prescribed to force a similar variation of soil moisture. A 30 % decrease in rainfall is sufficient to simulate grasses at gON. A 100 % increase in rainfall is sufficient to simulate trees at II°N. However, even with a five fold increase in rainfall, the model fails to simulate trees at 13 °N. To study the influences of topography explicitly, a distributed hydrologic modeling is performed using SHE.

40|$|Phytoliths {{are mostly}} formed by {{groundwater}} silica carried upwards in a plant's vascular system and consequently accumulated {{in different parts}} of the plant. After the plant's death, the phytoliths shaped in specific morphotypes are released into the soil. Phytolith assemblages found in the soil can therefore provide information on the previous vegetation cover. The use of phytoliths as a paleoecological tool is based on their high stability in a broad spectrum of environments, even in arid conditions which are usually not suitable for preservation of pollen grains and plant macro-remains. Analysis of surface phytolith assemblages linked to the parallel study of modern vegetation is offering a good opportunity to refine our knowledge of paleoecosystems of NE Africa by evaluating the interpretation value of the fossil data. Modern phytolith assemblages are usually interpreted by using their phytolith ratio to estimate the density of tree cover, the aridity, and the proportion of C 3 and C 4 grasses (Barboni et al. 1999).
