Their characteristics are of interest because they can have a wide pore size distribution with micro- and meso-pores due to the zeolite and geopolymer, respectively. In this study, Zeolite-geopolymer hybrid bulk materials were fabricated using four kinds of <b>kaolinitic</b> <b>clays</b> (a halloysite and three kinds of kaolinite). The <b>kaolinitic</b> <b>clays</b> were first calcined at 700 °C for 3 h to transform into the amorphous aluminosilicate phases. Alkali-activation treatment of the metakaolin yielded bulk materials with different amounts and types of zeolite and different compressive strength.

The <b>kaolinitic</b> <b>clays</b> and their metakaolin were characterized by XRD analysis, chemical composition, crystallite size, 29 Si and 27 Al MAS NMR analysis, and specific surface area measurements. The correlation between the amount of zeolite formed and the compressive strength of the resultant hybrid bulk materials, previously reported by other researchers was not positively observed. In the studied systems, the effects of Si/Al and crystalline size were observed.

In this work, the potential use of two thermically activated <b>kaolinitic</b> <b>clays</b> as pozzolanic materials coming from different deposits of Argentina, is studied. Both <b>Kaolinitic</b> <b>clays</b> have different kaolinite content and a different order-disorder structure.

It was determined that mortars containing calcined clay with a higher percentage of kaolinite and certain disorder degree in its crystallinity previous to calcination, developed higher resistance to compression. This can be attributed to larger quantity of hydration products caused by the pozzolanic reaction, which also produces a better pore size arrangement. To conclude, when <b>kaolinitic</b> <b>clays</b> are used as pozzolana, kaolinitic percentage and structural disorder are variables to be taken into account...|$|R

The physico-chemical bonding mechanisms induced by the stabilization process were studied at a micro-level using various spectroscopic and microscopic techniques, such as X-ray diffractometry (XRD), field emission scanning electron microscopy (FESEM), energy-dispersive X-ray spectrometry (EDAX), Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy (FTIR), Brunauer, Emmett and Teller (BET) surface area analysis and particle size analysis (PSA) using a laser diffraction approach.
