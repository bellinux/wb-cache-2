40|$|The {{new line}} 9 of Barcelona’s subway {{has lots of}} {{constructive}} peculiarities (shaft type stations, depth) and innovations, which make it unique in several senses, like {{also the fact that}} it will become in a near future in the biggest automatic line in Europe when its 48 kilometers will be completed, providing security and regularity in the service to its customers. The automation entails a higher technical complexity, expressed in the integration of new systems, and coordination complexity, which make necessary an adequate management in order to guarantee the set availability of all equipments and therefore, be able to offer an optimal service. For this reason, it is necessary to have a work team that supervise the correct working and be able to carry out the <b>first</b> <b>level</b> <b>maintenance</b> and the recovery of those equipments in case of failure. Thus, at line 9 has been defined a new organizational model in which, in order to solve the new challenges and necessities and guarantee efficiently the availability, a unique category of staff in line, the TOLA (Operation Technician of Automatic Lines), has been created. With a profile with higher technical competences they roam in trains and stations in base to concrete missions with the aim of accomplish these objectives in the fastest and most efficient way. For carrying out a fast resolution of any incidence, with a minimum repercussion in the service, it is necessary to have the TOLA positioned. As a result, their mobilization in front of any incidence will be the most accurate and it will allow a resolution in the minimum time possible. Is so important the location necessity that a provisional system has been defined. Nevertheless, the fact that the scalability is not enough in order to manage the complete line and the problems of active location, which means that users have {{to take part in the}} process by introducing a code, make necessary the approach of a new location system that has to solve these drawbacks. Therefore, the main goal of the project is to design an indoor location system which has to solve these drawbacks and improve the functionalities of the previous system...|$|E

The {{manufacture}} of high precision components requires highly efficient staff and machinery. Oberg machines {{have the ability}} to create parts with tolerances of the order of millionths of an inch. However, the maintenance provided these have not been entirely effective. This is due, among other things, not had molded a maintenance program to the actual operating conditions of the machines. The weaknesses in the organization of maintenance have also been raised by the auditors of the ISO 13485 : 2003. Some of the teams that have been most affected by this reality are flat grinders, which, in fact, are the object of carrying out this work. The project is located in one of two buildings that the company in Costa Rica within the Metropolitan Free Zone, specifically home to the largest amount of surface grinders. It was decided to evaluate the maintenance department with standard COVENIN 2500 - 93 Manual for Evaluating Systems Maintenance Industry. In {{order to be able to}} quantitatively measure the strengths and weaknesses of the department and identify opportunities for improvement. In generating preventive maintenance program took into account the observations derived from the standard and the steps considered by Jorge Valverde in document maintenance strategies.
