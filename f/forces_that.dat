5|$|A replica wooden bridge {{runs from}} the outer defences over the water to an island called a ravelin, which is in turn linked to the inner defences by another replica bridge, {{protected}} with two drawbridges.

5|$|All of {{the forces}} in the {{universe}} are based on four fundamental interactions. The strong and weak forces are nuclear <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> act only at very short distances, and {{are responsible for the}} interactions between subatomic particles, including nucleons and compound nuclei. The electromagnetic force acts between electric charges, and the gravitational force acts between masses. All other forces in nature derive from these four fundamental interactions. For example, friction is a manifestation of the electromagnetic force acting between the atoms of two surfaces, and the Pauli exclusion principle, which does not permit atoms to pass through each other. Similarly, the forces in springs, modeled by Hooke's law, are the result of electromagnetic forces and the Exclusion Principle acting together to return an object to its equilibrium position. Centrifugal forces are acceleration <b>forces</b> <b>that</b> arise simply from the acceleration of rotating frames of reference.|$|E
