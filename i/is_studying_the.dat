In the following months, Peter (Chandler Canterbury) doubts he is from the prime universe, and attempts to drown himself in Reiden Lake, believing it the way to his universe.

500|$|In {{order to}} deal with the high number of {{passengers}} in transfer stations, Metro <b>is</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> possibility of building pedestrian connections between nearby core transfer stations. For example, a [...] passage between Metro Center and Gallery Place stations would allow passengers to transfer between the Orange/Blue/Silver and Yellow/Green Lines without going one stop on the Red Line. Another tunnel between Farragut West and Farragut North stations would allow transfers between the Red and Orange/Blue/Silver lines, decreasing transfer demand at Metro Center by an estimated 11%. The Farragut pedestrian tunnel has yet to be physically implemented, but was added in virtual form effective October 28, 2011. The SmarTrip system now interprets an exit from one Farragut station and entrance to the other as part of a single trip, allowing card holders to transfer on foot without having to pay a second full fare.|$|E
500|$|Many rare {{herbaceous}} {{plants and}} insects {{occur on the}} island. The west coast of the island supports over 200 plant species. Rare species such as Long’s braya (Braya longii) and Fernald’s braya (B. fernaldii), are endemic to Newfoundland. [...] Brayas are small perennial herbs of the brassicaceae family. They are only found on a narrow strip of land extending approximately [...] on the extreme western portion of the Great Northern Peninsula, a limestones barrens habitat. The braya population is low due to habitat loss from gravel quarrying. Researchers have only found three populations of Long's braya, and 14 or 15 populations of Fernald's brayas. Researchers have focused on how various types of disturbances affect the long-term viability of these populations. The Province of Newfoundland and Labrador, with many partners, <b>is</b> <b>studying</b> <b>the</b> rare plant flora of the island of Newfoundland and in 2002 announced a recovery plan for the braya species.|$|E
