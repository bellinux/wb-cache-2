40|$|ABSTRACT. The {{process of}} <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> is an {{important}} step in cultivating land for agricultural production. For this rea-son, the technical process of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> was studied using various methods of scientific research and analysis. The focus was primarily on improving the working principles of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading,</b> using so−called wide−angle manure spreaders. Results of the analysis of material transport along the rotor revealed the most relevant parameters of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading.</b> It was found that friction is not the most important parameter. The initial position of pieces of manure and the rotational frequen-cy of the rotor are far more important. The coefficient of friction between the rotor and pieces of manure has a minimum influ-ence on the tangential speed of a piece on the rotor, which in turn also means a minimum influence on the range of spreading. The initial position of the piece on the rotor has an influence on the tangential speed and travel of the piece on the rotor. The tangential speed of the piece as it departs from the rotor is influenced by the size of rotor and the rotational frequency of the rotor. Included are recommendations regarding the process of constructing a new spreading device or improving existing methods of <b>spreading</b> <b>manure...</b>|$|R

40|$|A need {{exists to}} improve the {{utilization}} of manure nutrients by minimizing NH 3 emissions from land application of manure. Management strategies to reduce NH 3 emissions are available; however, few have been validated under Canadian conditions. A well tested and accurate simulation model, however, can help overcome this challenge by determining appropriate management strategies for a given set of field conditions. The Volt'Air simulation model was utilized to estimate NH 3 volatilization from <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> for various <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> considerations under a range of atmospheric conditions typically encountered in eastern Canada. Considerations included: (i) soil liming, (ii) time of day of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading,</b> (iii) rainfall (timing and amount) and (iv) manure incorporation (timing, depth and manure coverage). Results demonstrated that liming to increase soil pH, increased NH 3 emissions by 3. 3 kg ha- 1 for each increment of 0. 1 pH (up to a 1. 5 total increase), over no liming at 34. 6 kg ha- 1. For each hour delay in <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> past 0800 h, NH 3 losses were reduced by 1. 5 kg ha- 1. Rainfall (10 mm) at least 20 h after manure application reduced losses, with increased reductions at higher rainfall amounts. Incorporation soon (1 h) after application was best for NH 3 mitigation. Increasing the depth of incorporation by 5 cm reduced NH 3 emissions by 4. 4 kg ha- 1; also increasing manure coverage by incorporation reduced losses by 2 kg ha- 1 for each 10 % increase in coverage, compared to surface application at 34. 6 kg ha- 1. This investigation using Volt'Air yielded valuable information about simulating manure management strategies and the magnitude of their effects on NH 3 emissions...|$|R

The land use activities, often developed within these aquifers, are the cattle grazing and <b>manure</b> <b>spreading.</b> Pasture and <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> are able to cause bacterial contamination of drinking water in karst aquifers. The time dependence of microbial contamination is strongly conditioned by the distribution of precipitation versus time, with emphasis on those precipitation which produce effective infiltration and transport of microorganisms from the ground toward both the groundwater and the springs. Both the retardation and the number of microorganisms transported into the subsurface are strongly conditioned by the interaction with soil and aquifer. This interaction often produces significant differences between microorganisms, due to differences in their properties for attachment to solid surface within both media. Significant differences concerning the temporal and spatial distribution of groundwater microbial contamination is expected in the case the system “swallow hole - karst conduits - spring” is partially located within the saturated medium or in the case the same system is entirely located within the unsaturated medium...|$|R

40|$|From July 2002 until September 2003, a {{detailed}} ammonia emission inventory {{was carried out}} in concurrence with detailed measurements of the ammonia concentrations in air in a 3 × 3 km area in the East of the Netherlands. The main goal of the project was to validate the emission inventory by comparing modelled ammonia concentrations based on these emissions to the measured concentrations. It was found that the emissions from animal housings are the dominant source of ammonia over the year. Only incidentally, emissions of <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> were larger. The spatial and temporal variations in the concentrations over the year are well represented by the OPS model based on these emissions. For the entire period, the model shows an underestimation of the concentrations of about 15 % (explained variance of the regression line of 76 %). In the winter period, which is characterized by a dominance of the emissions from animal housings, the underestimation is only 5 %. This most likely indicates that the emissions from animal housings, which in the area is mainly from pigs, are estimated correctly, as well as the modeling of the concentrations, for this period. In both the Spring and August 2003 period, a gap between calculated and measured ammonia concentrations was found. Under spring conditions, this gap is most likely the result of an underestimation of the emission during <b>manure</b> <b>spreading.</b> A part of the underestimation may be attributed to a reduction in the dry deposition process in the successive weeks after spreading which is caused by a saturation of the grassland with ammonium. Taking into account the uncertainty in this dry deposition process, it was estimated that the underestimate of the emissions by <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> could amount from 15 % to 60 %. The gap in August 2003, which was a very warm and dry month, is most probably caused by re-emission of ammonia at a large scale in and around the VELD area.

40|$|Animal {{husbandry}} is a {{major source}} of nutrient loading. Both feed production and <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> cause nutrient emissions into ground and surface waters. In regions where intensive animal husbandry meets soils already rich in phosphorus, risk for eutrophication increases. This article analyses how livestock installations and <b>manure</b> <b>spreading</b> are regulated as potential sources of nutrient loading in Finland. The regulation is a complex mix of economic and command-and-control instruments. The agri-environmental subsidy scheme acts as the primary tool in regulating agricultural water pollution. In Finland, about 90 % of farms have been committed to the agri-environmental scheme and its terms, but as shown in the paper, the share is decreasing and may well continue to do so as agricultural production continues to intensify. For the farms outside the agri-environmental scheme, general legal standards limit fertilisation, but in a less strict manner. Additional local restrictions can be established by municipal regulations. The environmental permit scheme covers vast majority of livestock installations. Stipulations issued in the permits do not only regulate the emissions from the livestock installation as a point source, but extend to regulate even the <b>spreading</b> of <b>manure,</b> which is often contracted out and spread on the fields by other farmers. The analysis indicates that the regulatory system suffers from unnecessary duplication, sometimes even incoherency. As a result, regulation seems to place a relatively high regulatory burden on farmers and authorities. Questions on optimal regulatory approach – and the role of legal standards and environmental permits in particular – are further stressed by ongoing structural development in livestock production: as farm size continues to grow and farms become ever more specialised, manure management will be decoupled from the livestock installation...|$|R
40|$|Matching the agronomic {{limits of}} <b>manure</b> <b>spread</b> lands from housed animal units is an {{international}} concern where receiving lands can become over supplied and lead to water quality problems where eutrophication is a risk. Across the EU, this means establishing policy to export <b>manures</b> to off-farm <b>spread</b> lands under tight regulation. Transitional arrangements across, for example, the Republic of Ireland between 2006 - 2010 allowed pig and poultry <b>manures</b> to be <b>spread</b> subject only to the nitrogen amendment limits of the EU Nitrates Directive and not the phosphorus limits. From 2013 this arrangement is to be phased out, and pig and poultry producers have consequently expressed concerns about the availability of recipient spread lands for these manures.

Considerable amounts of ammonia (NH 3) and greenhouse gases may be emitted during storage, which has deleterious environmental effects.

An experiment was thus set up to study gaseous emissions during storage of the solid fraction, and the effects of the oxygenation of <b>manure</b> <b>heaps</b> on emissions of NH 3 and various greenhouse gases. Emissions of NH 3 and the greenhouse gases methane (CH 4), nitrous oxide (N 2 O), and carbon dioxide (CO 2) from an uncovered and covered heap of solids separated from pig slurry were compared, and related to the oxygenation level inside the <b>manure</b> <b>heap.</b> Approximately 15 % of the initial nitrogen content was lost when separated solids were stored uncovered.

Oxygenation level inside the heap was found to influence the production and emission of greenhouse gases. Covering the heap with an airtight material delayed aeration of the bulk of the stored manure, which reduced the internal heat production, degradation of organic matter, and emission of NH 3 and greenhouse gases.
