40|$|This paper {{uses the}} Kuhn-Tucker demand system {{modeling}} technique {{to investigate the}} capacity of a typical week in capturing rhythms in activity-travel behavior. It considers all possible activity types within a weeklong modeling time frame. Complex interactions in time expenditure between at-home versus out-of-home activities and among different out-of-home activities are captured by introducing behavioral elements in the model in terms of baseline preference, time translation, and satiation effects. The Kuhn-Tucker demand system model used in this paper is a random utility maximization model with the inherent assumption that every individual maximizes his/her total utility in allocating time to the activities under consideration within the modeling time frame. Models are developed for each individual week of a six-week travel diary, the MobiDrive dataset for Karlsruhe and Halle, Germany. Each model contains 83 variables and reveals behavioral details of our complex activity-travel behavior.

40|$|ABSTRACT. The active medium {{with the}} inverse charge carrier {{population}} {{is known to}} {{form the basis of}} up-to-date semiconductor masers and lasers. This population can be created by various actions including electron generation and heating towards the conductivity region by means of electromagnetic radiation (photoheating). The objective of our studies was to find the conditions for formation of regions of hot photoelectron distribution when their lifetime is controlled by trapping by negatively and positively charged impurity centers for different energy relaxation mechanisms, both quasi-elastic and strongly inelastic. © 2009 Bull. Georg. Natl. Acad. Sci. Key words: inverse population, photoelectron distribution. To study the possibility of occurrence of the inverse distribution function at hot photoelectrons trapping by repulsive impurity centers it is, first of all, necessary to establish the analytical form of the energy dependence of the trapping coefficient () εC. For this purpose, a great bulk of the existing experimental data (essentially for Si and Ge), as well as theoretical results have been analyzed to calculate the trapping coefficient.

40|$|Foodborne {{disease is}} a common, but preventable, burden of illness worldwide. Almost {{one-half}} of every dollar spent on food in the United States is spent on food from restaurants. A growing body of data from foodborne disease outbreaks and studies of sporadic (non–outbreak-associated) gastrointestinal disease of various etiologies suggest that eating food prepared in restaurants is {{an important source of}} infection. These data suggest a critical need for action that is focused on preventing disease transmission within the food service industry. Clinicians should report all suspected foodborne disease to public health authorities to ensure appropriate epidemiologic investigation. Restaurants served 170 billion meals in the United States in 2005. Of all the money spent on food in the United States, 47 % is spent in restaurants, and the food service industry employs 19 % of the nation’s workforce [1]. Four in 10 Americans eat in restaurants on any given day, and 1 in 6 eats 15 meals per week in restaurants [2].

We will probe the association between common polymorphisms in {{a large number of}} candidate cancer susceptibility genes and the risk of breast and prostate cancer. Furthermore, we will develop computational and statistical methods that center on the analysis of genetic data from studies of complex diseases. To maximize our likelihood of success, we have chosen to study two European populations with different genetic backgrounds, the homogeneous, well defined population of Iceland and the more mixed population of the Netherlands. The collection of accurate clinical information allows the definition of different clinical phenotypes which is of crucial importance in genetic studies of complex diseases like breast and prostate cancer. The long-term objective of the study is to gain an increased understanding of the genetic underpinnings of the various forms of breast and prostate cancer which may in turn lead to more effective risk assessment, increase the efficiency of screening programs and lead to improved diagnosis and treatment.

40|$|This study {{explores the}} role that a faith-driven {{discourse}} has played in the electoral success of the Tea Party movement. The popularity of the Tea Party movement among conservative Protestant populations has led researchers to depict an emerging theological political ideology. Few have considered the historical and religious influences on the Tea Party brand, {{despite the fact that}} it has garnered support from a segment of the conservative American population which have traditionally used religious rationalisation as the basis for their political opinions. This thesis examines these historical and religious influences by means of a discourse analysis. This allows for the success of Tea Party candidates to be understood in the context of the mobilisation of a “nation at threat” narrative, cast ostensibly in religious language. I find that the linking of political opponents to the concepts of socialism, unconstitutional practices and immoralism allowed for a consistent narrative to emerge, whereby certain conceptions of the American identity were prioritised and deemed “acceptable”. I conclude that the electoral success of the Tea Party can be explained by the mobilisation of a primarily faith-driven discourse that gains traction through the mobilisation of threat to American society. The need for further research to account for the religious and economics aspect of the Tea Party movement <b>is</b> <b>clea...</b>|$|E
40|$|Background: International {{collaboration}} (IC) {{is essential}} for the advance of stem cell research, a field characterized by marked asymmetries in knowledge and capacity between nations. China is emerging as a global leader in the stem cell field. However, knowledge on the extent and characteristics of IC in stem cell science, particularly China’s collaboration with developed economies, is lacking. Methods and Findings: We provide a scientometric analysis of the China–Canada collaboration in stem cell research, placing this in the context of other leading producers in the field. We analyze stem cell research published from 2006 to 2010 from the Scopus database, using co-authored papers as a proxy for collaboration. We examine IC levels, collaboration preferences, scientific impact, the collaborating institutions in China and Canada, areas of mutual interest, and funding sources. Our analysis shows rapid global expansion of the field with 48 % increase in papers from 2006 to 2010. China now ranks second globally after the United States. China has the lowest IC rate of countries examined, while Canada has one of the highest. China–Canada collaboration is rising steadily, more than doubling during 2006 – 2010. China–Canada collaboration enhances impact compared to papers authored solely by China-based researchers This difference remained significant even when comparing only papers published in English.

These complications prompted us to assess the antimicrobial activity of a topical Iseganan HCl mouthwash vs. placebo on the aerobic and facultatively anaerobic oral flora in these patients. Two hundred and twenty-five chemotherapy patients were recruited into a randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial, conducted at multiple centers. The study compared the antimicrobial efficacy of Iseganan HCl vs. placebo (95 % of the Iseganan and 97 % of the control group received myeloablative chemotherapy). Iseganan HCl 9 mg/ 3 ml was administered as a swish and swallow solution, six times daily for 21 - 28 days. Microbial cultures were made {{before and after the}} daily Iseganan mouth rinse on the first and final days of chemotherapy. The reduction in total microbial load after the first day of treatment was statistically significant (1. 59 vs. 0. 18 log 10 CFU for the Iseganan HCl and placebo groups, respectively, P < 0. 0001). Iseganan HCl rinse had a cumulative effect demonstrated by the significant {{difference between the two groups}} on the last day of the study (i. e. completion of Iseganan daily treatment) (P < 0. 05). The reduction was mainly due to decreased densities of viridans streptococci, non-hemolytic streptococci, and yeasts. The minimal inhibitory concentration (MIC) of Iseganan HCl remained the same throughout the course of treatment. Topical Iseganan HCl significantly reduces the total oral aerobic bacterial, streptococcal, and yeast load.

40|$|Mouse macrophages express several {{distinct}} {{plasma membrane}} receptors for the Fc domain of IgG (1). The most numerous and best characterized is the trypsin-resistant Fc receptor (FcR) 1 specific for IgG 1 and IgG 2 b. The receptor is a 60 -kD transmembrane glycoprotein (2, 3) {{involved in a}} variety of macrophage host defense functions, such as the release of potent cytotoxic and inflammatory agents, the pinocytosis of soluble immune complexes, and the phagocytosis of large IgG-coated particles (1). Previous studies of FcR-mediated endocytosis have shown that certain ligands can modulate the cell surface expression of the receptor (4 - 6). Internalization of soluble or particulate IgG-containing immune complexes is accompanied by the net loss of FcR from the cell surface. Both receptor and ligand are degraded, presumably in lysosomes, and de novo synthesis is required to restore the original number of surface FcR (6). On the other hand, when the ligand is a monovalent Fab fragment of the antireceptor antibody 2. 4 G 2 (7), FcR-Fab complexes rapidly recycle between the cell surface and a nonlysosomal endocytic compartment, i. e., endosomes (5). There is no {{decrease in the number of}} surface receptors and no acceleration in the rate of receptor degradation. Many basic questions remain unanswered regarding the control of FcRmediated endocytosis in macrophages. The pathways and organelles involved in the uptake of receptor-ligand complexes have been only superficially characterized (8), and the intracellular fate of the receptor during IgG complex uptake has yet to be directly shown. In addition, the mechanism by which the multivalent antibody-antigen complexes prevent FcR recycling, in contrast to the behavior of the monovalent antireceptor Fab, is of particular interest. While the different valencies of these two iigands have been suggested to play a role (6), it <b>is</b> <b>clea...</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the evolution of}} automatic target de-tection algorithms and their application to the detection of shipping in spaceborne SAR imagery. Evolutionary Computing (EC) techniques are used to gen-erate both Finite State Machines (FSMs) and the math-ematical functions embedded within their states. These mathematical functions are evolved using Genetic Pro-gramming (GP). The GP function set used is F = {+,−,×,÷,¬,max,min}, where ¬ negates its argu-ment, and max, min returns the maximum and minimum of its input arguments respectively. The GP terminal set used is T = {s 0, [...] ., s 15 }, where s 0, [...] ., s 15 are statistical features extracted from the image pixels. In our model, two GPs are embedded within each state of the FSM. The FSM is thus {{a function of the}} GPs embedded within its states, and hence denoted FSM(GP). In addition, each state has an associated transition level τ upon which the state transition function ϑ bases its decisions. Let qi, qj, and qn be arbitrary states, qz be the halt state, and GPm be an arbitrary GP. Assuming that at least one state transition has taken place, the algorithm operates as follows. GPm ∈ qn is evaluated and returns an output vm ∈ R. The state transition function ϑ then generates a transition ϑ: qn × vm 7 → qi if |vm | 0 or as non-target if vm < 0. If the state entered is not terminal, i. e. qz, GPvm is ex-ecuted next. Thus, GPs are given access to results from previous states, allowing evidence to be accumulated dur-ing processing until there is sufficient upon which to base a sound decision.
