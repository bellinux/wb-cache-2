25|$|By {{the time}} of the English Revolution Helwys' stance on {{religious}} toleration was more commonplace. However, whilst accepting their zeal in desiring a 'godly society', some contemporary historians doubt whether the English Puritans during the English Revolution were as committed to religious liberty and pluralism as traditional histories have suggested. However, historian John Coffey's recent work emphasises the contribution of a minority of radical Protestants who steadfastly sought toleration for heresy, blasphemy, Catholicism, non-Christian religions, and even atheism. This minority included the Seekers, as well as the General Baptists and the Levellers. Their collective witness demanded the church be an entirely voluntary, non-coercive community able to evangelise <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> society governed by a purely civil state. Such a demand was {{in sharp contrast to the}} ambitions of the magisterial Protestantism of the Calvinist majority.|$|E

The review of related literature revealed {{a shortage of}} both research and practical applications regarding multicultural approaches in the classroom. Therefore, {{the purpose of this}} project was to develop a curriculum which incorporated appropriate learning activities and strategies designed to enhance positive attitudes toward cultural differences in the elementary classroom. The project was developed for third graders and goals which promoted a multicultural perspective were outlined. An attitudinal survey was developed and administered as a pre test to establish entry level attitudes toward diversity. Activities designed to facilitate the goal of the project were implemented during a six-week period. The attitudinal survey was readministered as a post test to assess potential changes in students 2 ̆ 7 attitudes. The data gathered was analyzed using comparisons of pre and post test responses.

2500|$|However, {{even though}} {{mathematics}}, or studies in logic {{were part of}} the madrasa's curriculum, they were all centred around religion. Even mathematics had a religious impulse behind its teachings. [...] "The Ulema of the Ottoman medreses held the view that hostility to logic and mathematics was futile since these accustomed the mind to correct thinking and thus helped to reveal divine truths" [...] – key word being [...] "divine". İnalcık also mentions that even philosophy was only allowed to be studied so that it helped to confirm the doctrines of Islam." [...] Hence, madaris – schools were basically religious centres for religious teachings and learning in the Ottoman world. Although scholars such as Goffman have argued that the Ottomans were highly tolerant and lived <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> society, it seems that schools that were the main centres for learning were in fact heftily religious and were not religiously pluralistic, but centred around Islam. Similarly, in Europe [...] "Jewish children learned the Hebrew letters and texts of basic prayers at home, and then attended a school organised by the synagogue to study the Torah." [...] Wiesner-Hanks also says that Protestants also wanted to teach [...] "proper religious values." [...] This shows that in the early modern period, Ottomans and Europeans were similar in their ideas about how schools should be managed and what they should be primarily focused on. Thus, Ottoman madaris were very similar to present day schools {{in the sense that they}} offered a wide range of studies; however, these studies, in their ultimate objective, aimed to further solidify and consolidate Islamic practices and theories.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{examines}} Mozambique’s current {{move towards}} {{the development of}} <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> national system of rural extension. The Government’s present agricultural policy framework {{has resulted in the}} development of a National Extension Master Plan that calls for the advancement of an Integrated National Extension System (SISNE). SISNE envisages an institutionally diversified system of extension, utilising both public sector and private sector extension providers to disseminate agricultural information to farmers. This diversified system is to be promoted <b>in</b> part through <b>an</b> outsourcing initiative <b>in</b> two districts of two different provinces, Nampula and Zambezia. Aside from setting the stage for discussion, this paper has two purposes. The first is to examine the problems and challenges that confront Mozambique’s public sector extension service <b>in</b> developing <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> extension system. The second purpose is to consider the consequent role of the public sector and its responsibilities as both a provider of public sector extension services and as a coordinator, overseer and regulator of private sector provision. The paper concludes with a consideration of the meaning of Mozambique’s move towards <b>a</b> <b>pluralistic</b> national rural extension system both for its own purposes and the development of similar purposes in other developing countries Research findings Outsourcing provides the principal avenue for private sector organisations to become involved in agricultura...|$|R

The investigation attempted to discover {{the relative importance of}} goals and the relative level of goal achievement by the school as perceived by teachers, students and lay citizens of four neighboring communities of the Mackenzie Delta. The study also attempted to ascertain the level of meaningful involvement of participants in the goals study exercises. The model was essentially that developed by Birnie (1976) of the University of Saskatchewan. Birnie's model was modified for use in the North and field-tested <b>in</b> <b>a</b> culturally <b>pluralistic</b> community <b>in</b> Saskatchewan. The main features of the instrument were its forced ranking technique and a set of goal statements written in the vernacular of the lay citizens of the communities. The sample consisted of 335 people from the communities of Inuvik, Tuktoyaktuk, Aklavik, and Fort McPherson. Sub-groups included native and non-native respondents, teacher assistants, education committee members and major cultural groups. Variables included highest level of education attained, sex, age, occupation, and duration of life in the North. The goals study model was found to have potential for involving the people of the communities, students and teachers in meaningful dialogue about the important tasks for the school. The study determined that there were similarities and differences in key areas affecting the long term direction of school programming...|$|R
