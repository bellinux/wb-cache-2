500|$|Dibnah {{was praised}} by many notable British people. [...] After {{reporting}} on his death, television presenter Peter Sissons remarked: [...] "They don't make them like that any more". Comedian Peter Kay said: [...] "It's very sad news. He {{was one of}} a kind and now he has gone <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> no one else like him. He was enthusiastic about {{a way of life that}} has virtually disappeared now." [...] Brian Tetlow, chairman of the Bolton and District Civic Trust, said: [...] "He's unique, not just to Bolton but to Britain and the world. Our thoughts are with his wife and children." ...|$|E

"I {{think there}} is an {{obligation}} for the chairman and members of the Scottish Criminal Cases Review Commission to ask Lord Fraser to see them and testify under oath – it's that serious. Fraser should have said this at the time and, if not then, he was under a moral obligation to do so before the trial at Zeist. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> all sorts of consequences," [...] Dalyell declared.|$|E
2500|$|The {{vice-chairman}} of the Hillsborough Family Support Group, Philip Hammond, said {{he wanted}} all football fans to boycott the magazine, saying, [...] "I am going to write to every fanzine in the country – including Liverpool F.C.'s – telling them to ban FHM. People are very upset by it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a real boycott." [...] He added {{it would be like}} making jokes about the 2002 Bali bombings, in which eight fewer Australians were killed. The publication was finally discontinued in 2016, for unrelated reasons.|$|E
6000|$|... "You needn't puzzle {{your brain}} over that," [...] I {{answered}} gloomily, [...] "for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> soon {{be a few}} more skeletons in this beastly cave, that's all. Don't you see that those Abati will believe we are burned in the palace?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... “One cannot foresee everything, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> not {{be another}} {{display of the}} kind,” he said. “Well, I will make an admission. Would it astonish you to hear that, {{in spite of the}} sentence, it was not {{intended}} that you should face the firing party?” ...|$|R
5000|$|In {{response}} {{to the introduction of}} proposed clean coal technology, Flannery has stated: [...] "Globally there has got to be some areas where clean coal will work out, so <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> always be a coal export industry Australia ... Locally in Australia because of particular geological issues and because of the competition from cleaner and cheaper energy alternatives, I'm not 100 per cent sure clean coal is going to work out for our domestic market." ...|$|R
2500|$|In July 2014, Robinson, {{was sacked}} by Yorkshire for [...] "unprofessional actions"; in the 2014 season, {{he had made}} 7 T20 Blast {{appearances}} for Yorkshire, taking 6 wickets. Yorkshire coach Jason Gillespie said of the situation that [...] "When a player consistently displays behaviour that isn’t professional, {{there has to be}} a point in time when you say ‘look, this isn’t really working, you’re obviously not that bothered about playing for the club’. That point came, and it was tough." [...] and that [...] "He’s got to learn about his game and about being a professional sportsman. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a future for him in the professional game, but I think he needs to learn a lot, and I think he can do it." [...] Later in the 2014 season, Robinson made 1 List A appearance for Hampshire.|$|E
6000|$|... "It {{is quite}} possible, mademoiselle; {{we do not}} pretend to be invincible, but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> some tough {{fighting}} first." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It was {{to satisfy}} my own mind,' she said, {{colouring}} a little. 'I didn't want any one {{to act on}} it. Indeed, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> no occasion.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of course not," [...] 'Frisco Kid answered. [...] "And with Nelson {{and his two}} men an' French Pete, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>'ll</b> be {{any need}} for you anyway." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{will try}} not to get into scrapes, Miss Kate," [...] Reuben said. [...] "I don't do it often, you know, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be much chance of it, here." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now," [...] said Leo to me nervously in {{the silence}} that followed, and {{speaking}} in English, [...] "now I wish we were somewhere else, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be trouble." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'Come and see, Lily, for <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{enough to}} reserve a fresh {{lot of things}} for Miss Hacket's affair. By-the-by, Regie, did you say it rained at Darminster?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "With {{the holy}} Tanofir, Master, until I fetch her, {{training}} {{her younger sister}} to be a diviner's worthy Cup. Only perhaps I shall never send, seeing that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> fighting soon." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Of {{course you}} are,--and so will I and Louey. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> room: {{it is so}} large. There is a cab for all the things. Dear Emily, I am {{so glad to see}} you." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is {{high time}} that you were back, Oswald. Rumour is busy, all along the border; but for myself, though I doubt not that their moss troopers {{will be on the}} move, as soon as the truce ends, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> not be any {{invasion}} in force, for some little time. The great lords of the Scotch marches are ill friends with each other; and, until the quarrel between Douglas and Dunbar is patched up, neither will venture to march his forces into England. It may be months, yet, before we see their pennons flying on English soil.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Listen to the drums!' said Wali Dad. 'That is {{the heart}} of the people--empty and making much noise. How, think you, will the Mohurrum go this year? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be trouble.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "The chances are, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> {{be another}} dissolution. If they {{hold their own}} against Mr. Monk's motion, then they will pass an Irish Reform Bill. After that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> they must dissolve." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{for those}} who work in it; and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{something}} {{coming out of it}} for Sarah,--something, but it will be very small. And if so, she must depend for it solely on Mr Rubb." ...|$|E
6000|$|Coulthurst banged {{his hand}} down on the table. [...] "Then <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> an end of the trouble--and the affair could be {{arranged}} to meet your views. But however did you find {{the way into the}} Westerhouse country?" ...|$|E
60|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{the most}} {{extraordinary}} effort ever made to carry New York for Douglas. You and all others who write me from your State think the effort cannot succeed, and I hope you are right. Still, it will require close watching and great efforts on the other side.|$|E
6000|$|... "This is {{a regular}} young wildcat, Desmond. She very nearly got my hand in her mouth, and if she had she would have bitten a piece out. Well, <b>I</b> shouldn't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any more of them." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Listen to the drums!" [...] said Wali Dad. [...] "That is {{the heart}} of the people--empty and making much noise. How, think you, will the Mohurrum go this year? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be trouble." ...|$|R
5000|$|In August 2008, {{when asked}} if any efforts would be made to get {{additional}} federal money for the project, U.S. Senator Chuck Grassley said [...] "Not by this senator, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any by other senators." ...|$|R
60|$|What I chiefly {{propose to}} do to-night is to lay before you {{an account of}} the nature of the {{discovery}} which Harvey made, and which is termed the Discovery of the Circulation of the Blood. And I desire also, with some particularity, to draw your attention to the methods by which that discovery was achieved; for, in both these respects, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> much matter for profitable reflection.|$|E
6000|$|... "I quite think so, Colonel. You see, {{the facts}} will all {{come out at}} the coroner's inquest, and, when they do so, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> {{a good deal of}} strong feeling in the place if it is found that young Wyatt has been killed while bravely trying to capture Faulkner's murderer, {{while at the same time}} our warrant for his {{apprehension}} for the murder was still in force." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It is nature," [...] she said. [...] "It {{is to be}} expected, {{and will}} on that account be the less grievous {{because it has been}} expected. I shall have to devote myself to those Carroll children. I {{sometimes}} think that the work of the world should not be made pleasant to us. What profit will it be to me to have done my duty by you? <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> some profit if I am good to my cousins." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Or an archbishopric or two?" [...] said Julius. [...] "The pony can do it, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> as <b>there</b> <b>will</b> {{be a long}} rest. If {{he seems}} fagged, I can put up at Backsworth and take a fly." ...|$|R
6000|$|To that {{composite}} American {{identity of}} the future, Spanish character will supply {{some of the most}} needed parts. No stock shows a grander historic retrospect--grander in religiousness and loyalty, or for patriotism, courage, decorum, gravity and honor. (It is time to dismiss utterly the illusion-compound, half raw-head-and-bloody-bones and half Mysteries-of-Udolpho, inherited from the English writers of the past 200 years. It is time to realize--for it is certainly true--that <b>there</b> <b>will</b> not be found any more cruelty, tyranny, superstition, &c., in the resume of past Spanish history than in the corresponding resume of Anglo-Norman history. Nay, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> not be found so much.) ...|$|R
6000|$|... "They were {{a strong}} body, but how strong I could not tell. A hundred Prussians marching will {{make as much}} noise as five hundred Frenchmen, but even {{allowing}} for that <b>I</b> should <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be at least one strong battalion, perhaps more." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "There was no {{call for}} you to bring that basket, Master Conway. I know you are fond of a fish fried just when it is {{taken out of the}} water; and I have got bread and a keg of beer, to say nothing of a mouthful of spirits in case we get wet. Not that it looks likely we shall, for I doubts if there will be any rain to-night <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> more wind perhaps, and that it will get thicker; that's my view of the weather." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It may be I may be {{troublesome}} to you, sir," [...] {{said the}} King; [...] "for my fortunes are not such as to {{permit me to}} reject even the most limited offers of assistance; but if I can, I will dispense with applying to you. I would not willingly put any man's compassion at war with his sense of duty on my account.--Doctor, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> no farther tilting to-day, either with sword or cane; so we may as well return to the Lodge, and leave these"--looking at Alice and Everard--"who may have more to say in explanation." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Why should I {{hide the}} truth? Have you no {{eyes to see}} that he is enamoured of her loveliness--like others? Listen; a while ago my master Sinan chanced to lose his queen--how, we need not ask, but it is said that she wearied him. Now, as he must by law, he mourns for her a month, from full moon to full moon. But on the day after the full moon--that is, the third morning from now--he may wed again, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> <b>be</b> a marriage. Till then, however, your sister is as safe as though she yet sat at home in England before Salah-ed-din dreamed his dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|After {{fishing for}} a month, Ben Tripper said one Friday evening, [...] "We will {{run up to}} Leigh to-morrow and spend Sunday at home. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> we shall lose much, for the weather looks bad, and <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any fishing to-morrow." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "By the way, Hartington, I {{have reason}} to believe that you were right that that blow you luckily escaped was meant for me. However, <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any {{recurrence}} of the matter; in fact, I may say that I am sure there won't." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Quiet, {{as far as}} we were concerned. Of course, {{there have}} been a few trifling risings along the {{frontier}} but, as a whole, even the Zakka-Khels have been quiet. <b>I</b> don't <b>think</b> <b>there</b> <b>will</b> be any trouble, on a large scale, for some time to come." ...|$|R
