40|$|Abstract How {{to make a}} {{coordination}} policy between suppliers is one of {{key issues}} in Supply Chain Management. This paper deals with a case where multiple farmers harvest and deliver agricultural <b>fresh</b> <b>products</b> to multiple markets in proportion to each market size provided that the plants related to the <b>fresh</b> <b>products</b> get flowering periodically like tropical fruits such as papaya. A cooperative model is formulated in a mathematical form to obtain the optimal harvesting patterns for multiple farmers who harvest the <b>fresh</b> <b>products</b> cooperatively to maximize the consumption level of <b>fresh</b> <b>products</b> daily used in multiple markets. Although this model {{becomes a kind of}} mixed integer linear programming problem hard to solve in general, this paper reduces it into a simple LP problem easy to solve, exploiting some properties of optimal harvesting patterns analytically obtained in an individual un-cooperative model. Numerical analyses provide optimal harvesting patterns for cooperative multiple farmers, and make it clear that the cooperation effect depends on the delivery lead times from multiple farmers to multiple markets and the shift periods between flowering cycles among farmers. In a two-farm, two-market model, it is also shown that the increment of the consumption level of <b>fresh</b> <b>products</b> in the cooperative model compared with that in the individual un-cooperative model becomes largest when the shift period between flowering cycles among two farmers is just half a flowering cycle...|$|R

40|$|East Java {{is one of}} the {{contributing}} provinces, {{the largest}} in Indonesia, for <b>fresh</b> agricultural <b>products,</b> such as fruits and vegetables. <b>Fresh</b> agricultural <b>products</b> are category of perishable product. Perishable products will decrease the level of quality and value of products in line with increasing time. In order for <b>fresh</b> agricultural <b>products</b> produced by farmers can be consumed by consumers in the right quantity, right quality, right place, right time and right price, it is necessary to design a supply chain network model for <b>fresh</b> agricultural <b>products</b> by taking into account the level of product quality. This paper discussed the model development of supply chain network for <b>fresh</b> agricultural <b>products</b> in East Java by considering the level of product quality. Supply chain of <b>fresh</b> agricultural <b>products</b> consists of farmers, wholesalers, distributors and retailers. Supply chain network optimization model has an objective of maximizing the total supply chain profits. A numerical example is presented as the application of supply chain network optimization model for <b>fresh</b> agricultural <b>products.</b> The optimal result of supply chain network can be a recommendation to the East Java provincial government in the regulation of the distribution system of <b>fresh</b> agricultural <b>product...</b>|$|R

The album experienced commercial success {{similar to their}} debut when it peaked at number 103 on the Billboard 200, and sold {{nearly half a million}} copies. Critical reception was also positive, but some critics thought the album lacked the quality songwriting of its predecessor. Despite Blind's initial appeal with audiences, it drifted off the charts by the summer of 1993. The Sundays toured Britain in winter of 1992. The shows were [...] "rapturously received by fans starved of <b>fresh</b> <b>product</b> or gigs." [...] An American tour was greeted with sold out shows. Gavurin explained that they weren't necessarily attempting to promote the new album: [...] "A lot of people didn't see us the first time we played over here, and they want to hear earlier material.

50|$|Before {{the formal}} 1971 Oregon Bottle Bill, Oregon had already {{set up a}} less formal bottle return system that most stores {{and some of the}} public cooperated with. Inspired by the early Vermont bottle return system before it was repealed, Oregon's limited system paid 1 cent for beer bottles and cans and 3 cents for soda bottles and cans, and was started in the mid-1950s, and lasted {{through the rest of the}} 50s, {{throughout}} the 1960s and into the early 70s until the more formal and expanded Bottle Bill was enacted. The emphasis was on bottles, as bottlers were washed and re-used for <b>fresh</b> <b>product</b> sold to the public before health laws were enacted that stopped the re-wash system. And because of the low payout for the return of bottles and cans, and in spite of various anti-litter PSA advertising campaigns on Oregon television, only a relatively small percentage of Oregonians participated in the return of bottles and cans, and thus many bottles and cans still littered Oregon's highways and scenic areas throughout this entire early bottle-can recycling period.|$|E

40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to {{evaluate}} the properties of pumpkin (Cucurbita maxima L.) exposed to convective air drying and freeze-drying. The samples were analyzed in terms of physical properties (colour and texture). The trials in the convective chamber were done at 40 ºC and 60 ºC, in the drying tunnel at 60 ºC and in the freeze dryer at - 50 ºC. It was concluded that the freeze drying and the air drying at 40 ºC produced smaller changes in the colour while the drying in the tunnel originated more intense colour changes. With respect to texture, {{it was possible to}} deduce that the pulp in the <b>fresh</b> <b>product</b> at 2 cm off from the skin is harder than the pulp at 4 cm off from the skin. As to the effect of drying in the texture of the pumpkin, it was observed that all dryings affected texture considerably when compared to the <b>fresh</b> <b>product.</b> In fact, hardness varied from 75 % in the drying in chamber at 40 ºC to 90 % in the tunnel drying, when compared to the <b>fresh</b> <b>product.</b> As to springiness, it was changed more in the drying at 40 ºC, while cohesiveness showed the higher change in the freeze drying treatment...|$|E
