The Yuni from 2011 is left at Akakura to be rescued by the rescue team in 2011, and to go to SPHIA in 2012 to repeat the loop, making sure that Cocoro, Yomogi, and Mayuzumi survive the week. Satoru reviews his theory regarding Inubushi; <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> that she, too, was experiencing the transfer phenomenon, and that her consciousness ended up at Mount Akakura in the dying body of Hotori. <b>He</b> <b>thinks</b> the consciousness of Hotori inhabited Inubushi's body, rendering it free of homicidal tendencies, but realizes that since both his and Inubushi's consciousnesses remain at the island, Hotori cannot occupy Inubushi's body when he occupies his; Cocoro runs towards Inubushi, who is holding Utsumi's infant child {{over the edge of}} a cliff while singing.

5|$|He {{describes}} {{the range of}} species in each group in some detail, concluding that the birds are unlike those {{of any of the}} surrounding countries and are quite isolated, but are related to those of distant places including New Guinea, Australia, India and Africa; <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> there is nowhere else where so many such species occur in one place. Similarly in the Nymphalidae (he mentions the English member, the purple emperor butterfly), there are 48 species of which 35 are endemic to Celebes. He concludes that the Celebes group of islands is a major faunal division of the archipelago.|$|E

5|$|Later, Homer {{goes back}} to the {{farmhouse}} to think.

5|$|Lucasfilm's Industrial Light & Magic (ILM) {{created the}} visual effects sequences. The script called for Willow to restore Fin Raziel (Patricia Hayes) from a goat to her human form. Willow recites what <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> is the {{appropriate}} spell, but turns the goat into an ostrich, a peacock, a tortoise, and finally a tiger, before returning her to normal. ILM supervisor Dennis Muren considered using stop motion animation for the scene. He also explained that another traditional and practical way in the late-1980s to execute this sequence would have been {{through the use of}} an optical dissolve with cutaways at various stages.|$|E
5|$|When Marge and the {{children}} arrive at El Chemistri, Homer unknowingly arrives at an illegal meth lab that <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> is the actual restaurant. While the trio eat their meal (deconstructed Caesar salad) with other foodies, Marge feels guilty about misdirecting Homer. Meanwhile, Homer meets the meth dealer and other drug addicts, whom he believes to be food hipsters. Just as {{he is about to}} have a taste of the meth (which <b>he</b> <b>thinks</b> is food produced with the help of molecular gastronomy), the police burst in and a gunfight ensues between them and the drug addicts. At El Chemistri, Marge receives a panicked text message from Homer requesting help, and she asks the other foodies to help save her husband. They refuse, so she, Bart, and Lisa head by themselves towards the meth lab after receiving doggie bags from the chef who is angry that they are leaving. After arriving, Marge throws apple pie from her doggie bag into the mouth of the meth dealer. This causes a flashback inside his mind to his childhood days when his mother used to make apple pie. With the help of this distraction, the police subdue him. After Marge apologizes to Homer, they and their children decide to have fun together as a whole family from now on.|$|E
