40|$|Traditionally, {{many economists}} have {{examined}} the models and economics of <b>urban</b> <b>taxi</b> services under various types of regulation such as entry restriction and price control in an aggregate way. Only recently have we modeled <b>urban</b> <b>taxi</b> services in a network context. A realistic method has been proposed to describe vacant and occupied taxi movements in a road network and taxi drivers' search behavior for customers. A few extensions {{have been made to}} deal with demand elasticity and congestion effects together with development of efficient solution algorithms. Calibration and validation of the network taxi service models have been conducted towards their practical applications. This paper presents an overview of the research that has been carried out by the authors to develop network equilibrium models and solution algorithms for <b>urban</b> <b>taxi</b> services, and offers perspectives for future researches. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

Based on the 204 continuous hours of 3198 taxi vehicles’ operation data of Shenzhen, China, this paper analyzed the <b>urban</b> <b>taxi</b> driver’s activity distribution characteristics from different temporal and spatial levels. In the time level, we identified the difference with taxi daily operation pattern (weekday versus weekends), continuous time in one day, passengers in vehicle time, and taxi drivers’ operation frequency; in the space level, we explored the taxi driver’s searching pattern, including searching activity space distribution {{and the relationship between}} the pick-up locations and the drop-off locations. This research can be helpful for <b>urban</b> <b>taxi</b> drivers’ operation and behavior pattern identification, as well as the contribution to the geographical activity space analysis...|$|R

25|$|A taxi {{may have}} an 'Out of Service' sign on {{whenever}} the taxi is not available for hire, e.g., shift-changing. Passengers {{are not permitted to}} hire a taxi displaying an 'Out of Service' sign. Taxi drivers may continue to have a lit roof sign and 'For Hire' flag up if they are looking for customers wishing to head to areas in their service (e.g., an <b>urban</b> <b>taxi</b> in the New Territories, looking for fares heading to the urban area).|$|R
50|$|Taxi fares {{are charged}} {{according}} to the taximeter; however, additional charges on the fare table may apply, such as road tolls and luggage fees. <b>Urban</b> <b>taxis</b> are the most expensive, while Lantau taxis are the cheapest. The standard of service among different kinds of taxis is mostly the same. The reason for having three types of taxis is to ensure service availability in less populated regions, as running in the urban centre {{is considered to be}} more profitable.|$|R

40|$|Hong Kong, with a {{land area}} of only 1091 square {{kilometers}} of which about 15 per cent is built-up, {{has a population}} of more than six million people. We have a very convenient transportation network. Everyday, around 10 million passenger journeys are made on the system which includes two high capacity railways, trams, buses, mini buses, taxis and ferries. There are 266 licensed vehicles for every kilometer of road, and the topography is making it increasingly difficult to provide additional road capacity in the heavily built-up areas. Everyday, 15250 <b>urban</b> <b>taxis,</b> 2838 New Territories taxis and 40 Lantau taxis carry 1. 3 million passengers. The <b>urban</b> <b>taxi</b> operate throughout the territory, while, the others are fundamentally confined to the rural areas of the New Territories and Lantau Island. The study presented in this paper is based on a taxi service situation found in the urban area of Hong Kong. We shall model the demand and supply equilibrium of taxi transportation in a city from a theoretical point of view. Number of taxis, taxi fare and disposable income are important determinants of travel behavior. They are used as exogenous variables in this model. Several equations can be obtained from demand-supply equilibrium between daily passenger taxi trips, passenger waiting time, taxi utilization, average taxi waiting time and taxi availability. These models can be used for policy sensitivity analysis. It can be used by the transport department to allocate the taxis efficiently to cover the entire city in order to attain a better level of service. In this thesis, we will only consider <b>urban</b> <b>taxis.</b> The survey data used was 1986 to 1995 and was provided by the Hong Kong Transport Department and published in the Hong Kong Annual Digest. For example, the model can predict the impacts of taxi fare increase on passenger demand. It can provide valuable recommendations for the government regarding the control of fares and the number of taxis in a given city...|$|R

40|$|Energy {{conservation}} {{is one of}} the key priorities of sustainable development strategy. Transport systems are responsible for about one third of energy consumption. As result, the identification of solutions to reduce energy consumption in these systems is essential for the implementation of the sustainable development strategies. The present work is dedicated to identifying the possibilities for a reduction in the consumption of electric energy in <b>electric</b> <b>urban</b> public transport systems, using the audit of their electricity system. After justifying the importance of these concerns, a mathematical model of the electrical energy balance of the <b>electric</b> <b>urban</b> public transport system and its components is presented. The analysis is applied to determine the losses in the system components and useful energy, based on the evaluation and energy consumption measurements. The measurements to reduce energy losses are identified and characterized under technical and economic aspect, optimal electrical energy balances being done on this basis...|$|R
