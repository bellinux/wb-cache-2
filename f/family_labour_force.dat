We find that while {{the existence of a}} family business attracts remittance inflows, these monetary funds are associated with a reduced likelihood of business entrepreneurship. These results are consistent with various hypotheses regarding remittances and business investments. First, remittances may be motivated by the availability of investment opportunities in the home community. Second, remittances may respond to a bequest motive {{on the part of the}} emigrant, who may wish to lay claim on family assets when returning home. Lastly, remittances may cause an income effect that reduces <b>family</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participation and, correspondingly, the likelihood of family-run business investments.

A total of 175 small scale farmers {{were randomly selected}} and interviewed {{with the use of}} structured questionnaires in five out of the nine autonomous communities that make up the local government area. The data collected were analysed and the results showed that average <b>family</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> of 200 man days was not enough to cultivate the average farm size of 2. 158 hectares. Labour shortage exists. Farmers are making up for this shortage by using communal and hired labour. Each farmer uses on the average 48. 0 mandays of communal labour and 222. 24 mandays of hired labour in order to cultivate the average farm size. Shortage of farm labour was found to be due to increasing rate of migration of rural labour force to the urban centres, non-farm employment, non-availability of saving technologies e. g. fertilizers etc [...] A labour demand function was estimated against the following independent variables: Wage rate, farm size,cost of capital, cost of other inputs, family labour in mandays, communal labour and hired labour in mandays. The result showed that farm size, family labour, communal labour and hired labour were all significant while the other independent variables though not significant, have signs which agree with economic theory. Based on the findings of the analysis, some recommendations were made namely reducing drastically the rate of migration of rural labour force by embarking on rural development projects, provision of labour saving technologies...|$|E

However, there is little information on the production system. Interviews were carried out with 30 Siahjel nomad families of Raen origin in proximity of about 20 km to Baft city in 2010 to characterise the production system in terms of <b>family</b> <b>labour</b> <b>force,</b> work sharing, livestock numbers, management and marketing practices, and diseases. The nomads move their livestock over large distances within the rangelands of the region from May to November, and the majority migrate south during autumn and winter. Of the nomad families, 87 % live with and manage their animals together with one or more other related families. All household heads are males. All family members are involved in raising livestock; males and hired labourers dominate the physically harder jobs like shepherding and breeding, while women are involved in milking and caring. Of the animals, 80 % are owned by adult or young unmarried males, none by daughters. Average proportion of goats and sheep per family flock are 89 % and 8 %, respectively, which indicates that Siahjel nomads mainly rely on goats. Adult breeding females constituted the largest group within the goat herds. The rationale for keeping a high number of male goats may be related to their greater production of cashmere. Diseases accounted for 57 % of adult and 88 % of young animal deaths. The most prevalent diseases were enterotoxaemia, foot-and-mouth disease, pneumonia, agalactia and diarrhoea. Animal sales, meat, cashmere and milk production are the major reasons for keeping goats. Rangeland is considered as the main source of feeding (85 % of total annual feed intake); the remaining 15 % is provided by stubble grazing. However, the herds do not produce enough meat, milk and cashmere to sustain the life of the nomad families, and thus, they often have to sell part of their stock which will further decrease their income.|$|E

The Gender division of <b>labour</b> <b>force,</b> as a sociological aspect of labour market, {{has been the subject of}} extensive research in the past few decades. In this thesis we have formulated three questions which have been essentially derived from the literature on this subject. The questions pose possible gender based differences during the economic hardship of the 1980 s among three groups of <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> participants, namely, unemployed participants, those who held involuntary part-time work, and those who had to leave their jobs due to <b>family</b> responsibilities. The <b>labour</b> <b>force</b> data for 1980 s have been used to examine the questions. Our observations indicate that during the recession of 1983, on the average, men seem to have a higher rate of unemployment than women in the goods-producing sector. While the rate of involuntary part-time work is almost equal for both genders, regardless of sector, during the recession of 1983, the average rate of job leaving is, however, higher for women compared to men. These observations have been discussed from the perspective of Human Capital theory and Feminist theory. Job segregation theory has also been considered, though to a much lesser extent. The data have also been explored for the possible impact of some determinant variables, such as education and occupation, on the observed gender based differences...|$|R

It is being recognised that a sustainable rise in the fertility rate is needed in order to put a break on population ageing. Immigration can postpone but not stem the tide of ageing. In consequence, research into the reasons for the decline in the fertility rate and the role of public policy in promoting fertility gain momentum. There is growing evidence that social and economic policies do have an important role to play in raising fertility.

Event-history analyses are applied to retrospective data from the Spanish Fertility and Family Survey (1995). The results show that there are differences in women's fertility according to their occupational choice and demonstrate that health and teaching professionals show an advantage in harmonizing work and motherhood in Spain. This finding is consistent with the idea that not only the impact of occupational sex-segregation on women's fertility is explicable by each woman's specific attitudes towards motherhood and career but also by her employment conditions at the workplace.
