In time, they would transfer squadrons to accompany him. Voss contravened uniform regulations at times and could often be found in the hangar working on his machine beside the mechanics, dressed in a <b>grubby</b> jacket without insignia. His care extended to his craft's exterior; he adorned his Albatros D.III with both a swastika and a heart for good luck. And although he was a casual dresser around his home airfield, when flying he would be well-dressed with a silk shirt beneath his aviation gear. He joked {{that he wanted to be}} presentable to the girls of Paris if he were captured; however, the shirt's silk collar protected his neck from chafing while he swivelled his head about watching for other aircraft during flight.|$|E

In Melbourne, it was rumoured that Richard Stubbs received some flack for spending time in the Fox FM offices with his brother, announcer Peter Stubbs, better known as <b>Grubby,</b> who was co-hosting a breakfast show on Fox FM at the time). However, over the years the two stations have regularly swapped stars between themselves when an existing role hasn’t suited.|$|E

On the plains he has done a great deal to make the soil fine and rich, as I have already told you, but on hillsides he does a great deal of harm. The water runs down his tunnels and washes away the soil. Because of this and the damage he does to crops, man is his greatest enemy.

According to David Carr the {{political}} environs have such [...] "marbleness" [...] that it belies the clandestine nature of political activities, including those of Underwood who says he is there to [...] "clear the pipes and keep the sludge moving". The fictional newspaper, The Washington Herald, is set with [...] "brutal" [...] lighting and drab furniture, in part because it was filmed at the real life Baltimore Sun offices. Carr uses several pejorative adjectives to describe Barnes' apartment including sad, <b>grubby,</b> dirty, dreary and humble but note that this implies that the digital revolution is dominated by people [...] "on laptops who have no furniture". Similarly, Underwood and his associates are nattily clad, Barnes shows a lack of fashion recognition.|$|E

[...] Nolan noted, [...] "We gave a Francis Bacon spin to [...] This corruption, this decay in {{the texture of the}} look itself. It's <b>grubby.</b> You can almost imagine what he smells like." [...] In creating the [...] "anarchical" [...] look of the Joker, Hemming drew inspiration from such countercultural pop culture artists as Pete Doherty, Iggy Pop, and Johnny Rotten. Ledger described his [...] "clown" [...] mask, made up of three pieces of stamped silicone, as a [...] "new technology," [...] taking less than an hour for the make-up artists to apply, much faster than more-conventional prosthetics usually requires. Ledger also said that he felt he was barely wearing any make-up.|$|E
500|$|Before {{cementing}} {{his creative}} partnership with Anderson, Hoffman appeared {{in one of}} the year's biggest blockbusters, Twister, playing a <b>grubby,</b> hyperactive storm chaser alongside Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton. According to a People [...] survey of Twitter and Facebook users, Twister is the film with which [...] Hoffman is most popularly associated. He then reunited with Anderson for the director's second feature, Boogie Nights, about the Golden Age of Pornography. The ensemble-piece starred Mark Wahlberg, Julianne Moore, and Burt Reynolds; Hoffman played a boom operator, described by David Fear of Rolling Stone as a [...] "complete, unabashed loser", who attempts to seduce Wahlberg's character. Warmly received by critics, the film grew into a cult classic, and it has been cited as the role in which Hoffman first showed his full ability. Fear commended the [...] "naked emotional neediness" [...] of the performance, adding that it made for compulsive viewing. Hoffman later expressed his appreciation for Anderson when he called the director [...] "incomparable".|$|E

500|$|The {{risks of}} Operation Barras were {{acknowledged}} by the MoD and by officers {{involved in the}} planning and the assault. It was described by an SAS soldier as [...] "not a clinical, black balaclava, Princes Gate type operation. It was a very <b>grubby,</b> green operation with lots of potential for things to go wrong". Despite the risks, Richard Connaughton observed in Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed the Blair government was not averse {{to the possibility of}} casualties when they felt the cause was just. During the crisis and its immediate aftermath, the British government came under pressure from opposition politicians to end the deployment to Sierra Leone, and Dorman suggested that {{the success or failure of}} Operation Barras was [...] "inextricably linked" [...] to the fate of the wider British operation. He suggested that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone.|$|E
500|$|Individual Beatles later commented {{about their}} {{memories}} of Hamburg, with Lennon reflecting, [...] "We'd outlived the Hamburg stage {{and wanted to}} pack that up. We hated going back to Hamburg those last two times. We'd had that scene. Brian [...] made us go back to fulfill the contract...". Harrison had positive memories of the period: [...] "I'd have to say with hindsight that Hamburg bordered on the best of Beatles times. We didn't have any luxury, we didn't have any bathrooms or any clothes, we were pretty <b>grubby,</b> we couldn't afford anything, {{but on the other}} hand we weren't yet famous, so we didn't have to contend with the bullshit that comes with fame." [...] McCartney was philosophical: [...] "Hamburg was certainly a great childhood memory. But I think all things are enhanced by time. It was very exciting, though I think it felt better to me a little later in our career, once we'd started to get a bit of success with the records." ...|$|E
500|$|Several Harrison biographers {{likewise}} hold Extra Texture in low esteem, with Alan Clayson {{describing it}} as his [...] "artistic nadir" [...] and [...] "a bedsit record rather than a dancing one". Simon Leng writes that Harrison's post-Dark Horse [...] "rehabilitation disc" [...] came way too soon, resulting in an uncharacteristically passionless work, with its singer sounding [...] "punch drunk". Aside from the uplifting [...] "You", both authors identify [...] "Tired of Midnight Blue" [...] as the only saving grace. Gary Tillery notes the [...] "darkly sarcastic" [...] album title for a collection full of such [...] "downbeat" [...] tracks, the darkest of which is [...] "Grey Cloudy Lies". Harrison himself rated Extra Texture as his worst solo release of the 1970s. Speaking to Musician magazine in 1987, he dismissed it as [...] "a <b>grubby</b> album" [...] and added: [...] "The production left {{a lot to be}} desired, as did my performance... Some songs I like, but in retrospect I wasn't very happy about it." ...|$|E
5000|$|The {{crawlers}} {{were designed}} by Paul Hyett, a makeup and prosthetics creator. Production designer Simon Bowles said that the crawler design had started out as [...] "wide-eyed and more creature-like", but the design shifted toward a more human appearance. Crawlers originally had pure white skin, but the look was adjusted to seem <b>grubbier.</b> The skin was originally phosphorescent in appearance, but the effect was too bright and reflective in the darkened set, so the adjustment was made for them to blend in shadows. The director barred the film's cast from seeing the actors in full crawler make-up until their first appearance on screen. Actress Natalie Mendoza said of the effect, [...] "When the moment came, I nearly wet my pants! I was running around afterwards, laughing in this hysterical way and trying {{to hide the fact}} that I was pretty freaked out. Even after that scene, we never really felt comfortable with them." ...|$|R
500|$|Digby was hanged, {{drawn and}} {{quartered}} early on Thursday 30 January. [...] Throngs of spectators lined {{the streets as}} he was strapped to a wattled hurdle, and alongside Robert Wintour and John Grant was dragged by horse to {{the western end of}} Old St Paul's Cathedral churchyard. [...] Thomas Bates was delivered in a similar fashion, but from the Gatehouse Prison. [...] Armed guards interspersed along the route were there to defend against any possible rescue, but did not keep the miscreants' families from witnessing the fate of the four men. [...] Cold and <b>grubby,</b> Digby {{was the first of the}} four to face the executioner. [...] He mounted the scaffold and addressed the audience, telling them that he knew he had broken the law, but that morally, and in the eyes of his religion, he had committed no offence. [...] He asked for God's forgiveness, and the country's, and protested the Jesuits' and Father Gerard's innocence. [...] He refused the attentions of a Protestant clergyman, speaking to himself in Latin, before saying goodbye to his friends.|$|E

And gosh, it's thrilling stuff." [...] Sal Cinquemani of Slant Magazine called it [...] "a standout cut in which Madonna quite convincingly portrays a jilted bride turned femme fatale in the vein of Beatrix Kiddo," [...] writing that it [...] "plays more like a piss take of Ritchie's gangster fetish than a glorification of it." [...] Melinda Newman of HitFix called it [...] "one of the most compelling tracks, with Madonna singing in a low whispery register, detailing that she’s shot her lover dead in the head and, furthermore, she has no regrets. It’s violent and explicit and it’s what Madonna used to represent: a sense of danger." [...] Jim Farber of New York Daily News called it [...] "historic" [...] and [...] "may be the world’s first murder-ballad-as-disco song." ...|$|E
500|$|The Daily Mirror Beth Neil branded {{the plot}} strand [...] "one of the darkest and most {{disturbing}} storylines EastEnders has ever attempted", with critic Jim Shelley deeming it a [...] "new low" [...] for EastEnders. Shelley wrote of Whitney's abuse: [...] "You've {{really got to}} hand it to EastEnders. Just when you thought the show couldn't get any more miserable, the writers come up trumps and produce a new way of making us depressed - a paedophile storyline. Thanks for that! I realise now this is what the family meal has been missing three nights a week: gathering the telly to watch a <b>grubby,</b> greasyhaired thug drooling over a 15-year-old girl who (as luck would have it) spends her entire life in her school uniform even when she's not at school. And they say family entertainment's dead." [...] Shelley refuted the BBC's claims that the storyline had educational value as [...] "totally bogus", observing that [...] "At 7.30 or 8pm, the [...] "action" [...] has to be so coded as to be pointless". Deborah Orr, writing for The Independent, similarly disagreed with the BBC's statement that the storyline was part of EastEnders [...] "rich heritage of tackling difficult social issues", writing that: ...|$|E
500|$|The Texas Chain Saw Massacre is {{considered}} one of the greatest—and most controversial—of horror films, and a major influence on the genre. In 1999 Richard Zoglin of Time commented that it had [...] "set a new standard for slasher films". The Times listed it as one of the 50 most controversial films of all time. Tony Magistrale believes the film paved the way for horror to be used as a vehicle for social commentary. Describing it as [...] "cheap, <b>grubby</b> and out of control", Mark Olsen of the Los Angeles Times declared that it [...] "both defines and entirely supersedes the very notion of the exploitation picture". In his book Dark Romance: Sexuality in the Horror Film, David Hogan called it [...] "the most affecting gore thriller of all and, in a broader view, among the most effective horror films ever made ... the driving force of The Texas Chainsaw Massacre is something far more horrible than aberrant sexuality: total insanity." [...] According to Bill Nichols, it [...] "achieves the force of authentic art, profoundly disturbing, intensely personal, yet at the same time far more than personal". Leonard Wolf praised the film as [...] "...an exquisite work of art" [...] and compared it to a Greek tragedy, noting the lack of onscreen violence.|$|E
500|$|... "My Heart Is Broken" [...] {{was written}} by Amy Lee, Terry Balsamo, Tim McCord, Will Hunt and Zach Williams, while {{production}} was handled by Nick Raskulinecz. The song was recorded at Blackbird Studio in Nashville, Tennessee. During an interview, Amy Lee stated that she originally wrote the track on a harp. She further added that the band wrote the single along with [...] "What You Want", with the piano part {{at the beginning of}} the track being as well composed on a harp, which Lee considered a slower and easier instrument for her. However, during the pre-production of Evanescence, the band quickened the tempo of the song, so when the group attempted to record the song, playing the harp's part was not feasible. Particularly, Lee confessed that the song sounded better with the piano as it was a stronger and more prominent instrument which made the song [...] "one of the most passionate songs on the whole album". [...] "My Heart Is Broken" [...] portrays a ballad that starts with piano and Lee singing the lines [...] "I will never find a way to heal my soul/ And I will wander 'til the end of time/ Torn away from you/ My heart is broken" [...] during the chorus of the track. Chad Grischow of website IGN noticed [...] "cascading piano and <b>grubby</b> march of guitar and stomping drums" [...] in the single's composition, which was similar to the band's older material.|$|E
500|$|... "Outrageous" [...] {{received}} {{mixed reviews}} from music critics. Mim Udovitch of Blender called the song an [...] "R. Kelly club number, [...] has a hot, odd compulsion and lyrics that are practically big-pimpin', Spears-style". William Shaw of Blender selected {{it as the}} ninth best Spears song, highlighting [...] "the nonsense chants" [...] at 1:10. While reviewing , Ann Powers commented, [...] "'Outrageous' is R. Kelly's dirty little take on the ideal Janet Jackson song". Spence D. of IGN said of the song that [...] "it's a somewhat derivative Egyptian lover groove number. Yet for all [...] repetitiveness, it's still kind of funky and pervasive". Kelefa Sanneh of The New York Times called it [...] " [...] composition that cruises along on autopilot for two minutes and then suddenly switches gears with a delectable Michael Jackson-inspired bridge". Annabel Leathes of BBC Online stated that [...] "R. Kelly transform Britney into a <b>grubby</b> Beyoncé". Caryn Ganz of Spin called [...] "Outrageous" [...] a [...] "go-nowhere homage to living fabulously". Dave de Sylvia of Sputnikmusic called it [...] "a forgettable but nonetheless catchy single". David Browne of Entertainment Weekly said that along with [...] "(I Got That) Boom Boom", [...] " [...] {{are little more than}} wobbly, rhythm-based contraptions intended to advance Spears' sex-princess-on-the-loose image". Jamie Gill of Yahoo! Music Radio commented that, [...] "with its cheap, tinny production– it would take a rather senile and unworldly old lady in Tonbridge Wells [...] to find this even diverting, let alone shocking".|$|E
500|$|Although Gilbert {{announced}} a retirement from the theatre after {{the short run}} of his last work with Sullivan, The Grand Duke (1896) and the poor reception of his 1897 play The Fortune Hunter, he produced at least three more plays over the last dozen years of his life, including an unsuccessful opera, Fallen Fairies (1909), with Edward German. Gilbert also continued to supervise the various revivals of his works by the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company, including its London Repertory seasons in 1906–09. His last play, The Hooligan, produced just four months before his death, is a study of a young condemned thug in a prison cell. [...] Gilbert shows sympathy for his protagonist, {{the son of a}} thief who, brought up among thieves, kills his girlfriend. [...] As in some earlier work, the playwright displays [...] "his conviction that nurture rather than nature often accounted for criminal behaviour". [...] The grim and powerful piece became one of Gilbert's most successful serious dramas, and experts conclude that, in those last months of Gilbert's life, he was developing a new style, a [...] "mixture of irony, of social theme, and of <b>grubby</b> realism," [...] to replace the old [...] "Gilbertianism" [...] of which he had grown weary. In these last years, Gilbert also wrote children's book versions of H.M.S. Pinafore and The Mikado giving, in some cases, backstory that is not found in the librettos.|$|E

Richard Connaughton observed in the journal Small Wars & Insurgencies that the operation showed that Tony Blair's government was not averse {{to the possibility of}} casualties where they felt the cause was just. Geoff Hoon, British Secretary of State for Defence, summed up the effect of the operation at a press conference, stating that [...] " [...] sends a number of powerful messages. Firstly, it is a yet further demonstration of the refusal of successive British governments to do deals with terrorists and hostage takers. Secondly, we hope the West Side Group [...] and other rebel units in Sierra Leone will now [...] accept {{the rule of law and}} the authority of the democratically elected government of Sierra Leone. Thirdly, we hope all those who may in future consider taking similar actions against UK armed forces will think carefully about the possible consequences and realise there is nothing to be gained by such action". Andrew M. Dorman of King's College London suggested that the fate of the wider British operation in Sierra Leone depended heavily on the success or failure of Operation Barras and that, had the British forces been defeated, the United Kingdom would have been forced to withdraw all its forces from Sierra Leone. Dorman also suggests that a defeat would have [...] "raised questions" [...] regarding Tony Blair's policy of using armed force for humanitarian intervention.|$|E
500|$|In {{addition}} to the regular cast members, episodes feature guest voices from many ranges of professions, including actors, athletes, authors, musicians, and artists. American rock band Ween guest starred as themselves in [...] "Your Shoe's Untied". The band performed [...] "Loop de Loop", a song they written for the episode. Before SpongeBob SquarePants aired on television in 1999, Hillenburg had approached band guitarist Dean Ween to compose a song for the show. Dean Ween said [...] " [...] called {{me and told me}} [...] was a marine biologist who was starting a cartoon about underwater sea creatures and that The Mollusk was a big reference point for him creatively and would we like to do a song for the show." [...] The band conceived the song and wrote it in about three minutes. Ween's 1997 song [...] "Ocean Man" [...] would also be used four years later during the end credits sequence in The SpongeBob SquarePants Movie, and as part of the film's soundtrack. In the episode [...] "Bossy Boots", American band The Capsules performed the song [...] "Bossy Boots", which was later released on [...] in 2005. In [...] "Bubble Buddy", professional American surfer Corky Carroll made a vocal cameo as <b>Grubby</b> Grouper, a famous surfer. It also stars Brad Abrell as titular character Bubble Buddy.

In the entry [...] "Pre-Hibernation Week", where Sandy and SpongeBob play extreme sporting games, American heavy metal band Pantera appeared as themselves for a special musical performance. McHale's Navy actors Ernest Borgnine and Tim Conway returned in the episode [...] "Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy III", reprising their roles as Mermaid Man and Barnacle Boy, respectively. John Rhys-Davies also guest starred in the same episode as the heroes' nemesis, Man Ray.

Around this time, Miller moved in the old Wallace Reid mansion in Coldwater Canyon, now {{converted}} into a boarding house for aspiring actresses known as [...] "The House of the Seven Garbos." [...] Among the boarders were Ruth Roman, Suzan Ball and Linda Christian. According to Doris Lilly, a former boarder and later society columnist, [...] "The dignity {{of the house in}} general was presided over and encouraged by Kristine Miller, who was blonde haired, high of cheekbone, grey eyed. Kristine had balance, she would check some of our madder impulses, kept us calm when that was necessary. Her manner was quiet and refined, and she had a way of touching a <b>grubby</b> coffeepot {{as if it were the}} tiara of the Empress Josephine. In spite of her reserve, we all knew that Kristine had a fine future for her somewhere, and we felt that she was an excellent actress." ...|$|E
2500|$|The look of {{the film}} was {{achieved}} through the work of cinematographer John F. Seitz. At the time, Seitz was the premiere director of photography on the Paramount lot; his work extended {{all the way back}} to the silent era. Wilder had worked with Seitz on his previous film, Five Graves to Cairo, in which Seitz was nominated for an Academy Award and Wilder praised Seitz's willingness to experiment and fail. Here Wilder taps into his 1920s Berlin roots, and he and Seitz give the film a look subtly reminiscent of German expressionism, with dramatic deployment of light and shadows. [...] "He was ready for anything," [...] Wilder said. [...] "Sometimes the rushes were so dark that you couldn't see anything. He went to the limits of what could be done." [...] They would contrast the bright sunny Southern California exteriors, shot on location, with dark, gloomy, rotten interiors shot on soundstages to give the audience a sense of what lurks just beneath the facade – and just who is capable of murder. The contrast was heightened, in Wilder's words, by [...] "dirtying up" [...] the sets. Once the set was ready for filming, Wilder would go around and overturn a few ashtrays to give the house an appropriately <b>grubby</b> look. [...] Wilder and Seitz also blew aluminum particles into the air so that, as they floated down, they looked just like dust.|$|E
