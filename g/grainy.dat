5|$|A {{music video}} was also filmed for the So So Def remix. Directed by Diane Martel, it {{was shot in}} a <b>grainy</b> fashion to {{simulate}} a home video. The video features cameo appearances by Dupri, Tariq and Gunz. It begins with scenes of Carey and Dupri at a small in-home gathering, lounging and enjoying each other's company. As the video progresses, the other two featured hip-hop musicians appear at the house, alongside various other guests. They begin to dance to music, while sipping on cocktails by the pool. As the video reaches its climax, scenes of Carey singing in an outdoor garden are shown, while the others join her on the pool deck.|$|E
5|$|A set of {{fourteen}} redesigned Major Arcana tarot cards, {{based on the}} Rider-Waite deck, were commissioned by the singer for the album's artwork. The cards depict band members in surrealistic tableau. Each card was reinterpreted to reflect the iconography of the album's lyrical content: The Fool is stepping off a cliff, with <b>grainy</b> images of Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis and a JFK campaign poster in the background; The Emperor, with prosthetic legs, {{is sitting in a}} wheelchair clutching a rifle in front of an American flag; Justice weighs the Bible against the brain on his balance scale. The album's inner sleeve contains these three images, along with a further nine: The Magician, The High Priestess, The Hierophant, The Hermit, Death, The Devil, The Tower, The Star and The World. The cover itself represents The Hanged Man.|$|E
5|$|Michelle {{undergoes}} a session of regression hypnosis, where she {{claims to be}} twenty-four years old. She suddenly starts screaming in panic about someone trying to kill her, and the session is ended. Mulder reviews the video of the session, and {{is convinced that the}} girl is the reincarnation of Morris, having been conceived right around the time the detective was murdered. The tape contains a brief section of static noise just before Michelle begins screaming, which Mulder has an expert clean up. The noise is found to contain a <b>grainy</b> image of {{what appears to be a}} fish tank ornament of a man in an atmospheric diving suit. Meanwhile, Scully has tracked down Morris' autopsy findings, which show the presence of salt water in his respiratory tract, indicating he died of drowning. The agents realise from these findings that Morris was drowned in the exotic fish tank in Fiore's house.|$|E
50|$|Khoa is {{normally}} white or pale yellow. If prepared in the winter, {{it may be}} saved {{for use in the}} summer, and may acquire a green tinge and <b>grainier</b> texture from a surface mould. This is called hariyali (green khoa) and is used to make gulab jamun.|$|R
50|$|For many years, the {{original}} three-color Technicolor {{version of the}} film was not available for viewing, though a 16 millimeter version was available. This version had been printed (poorly) on two-color Cinecolor stock which did not accurately reproduce the colors of {{the original}} film. The smaller film stock also resulted in a <b>grainier,</b> inferior image.|$|R
5000|$|The Choir is a {{retrospective}} EP by The Choir {{that has been}} released only in 12" [...] format. The cover features the same photograph as Choir Practice, {{although it has been}} cropped and is much <b>grainier.</b> There are actually five songs on the record, even though the cover says that there are only four.|$|R
5|$|When lasers {{were first}} invented, laser speckle was {{considered}} to be a severe drawback in using lasers to illuminate objects, particularly in holographic imaging because of the <b>grainy</b> image produced. It was later realized that speckle patterns could carry information about the object's surface deformations. Butters and Leendertz developed the technique of speckle pattern interferometry in 1970, and since then, speckle has been exploited in a variety of other applications. A photograph is made of the speckle pattern before deformation, and a second photograph is made of the speckle pattern after deformation. Digital subtraction of the two images results in a correlation fringe pattern, where the fringes represent lines of equal deformation. Short laser pulses in the nanosecond range can be used to capture very fast transient events. A phase problem exists: In the absence of other information, one cannot tell the difference between contour lines indicating a peak versus contour lines indicating a trough. To resolve the issue of phase ambiguity, ESPI may be combined with phase shifting methods.|$|E
5|$|The video {{consists}} of multiple scenes with Carey and (now husband) Cannon, who plays her love interest. This is shown along with various behind-the-scenes footage of Carey at various promotional {{events in the}} United Kingdom. The video begins with <b>grainy</b> footage of a plane landing in the Bahamas, with Carey and Cannon exiting the aircraft with her dog. Throughout the video, scenes of Carey laying on a sofa, writing lyrics and tearing, {{as well as the}} singer in a darkened stage are shown. Several behind-the-scenes clips of Carey promoting the album in the United Kingdom are shown, as she arrives at a CD signing, and connects with fans. Following the signing, Carey is shown at a fashion show, as well as modelling in several outfits. Other scenes that intermingle are of Carey looking out of her hotel suite window in London, as well as candles being put out. During the second verse, the couple is seen spending time together on the island, spending time with friends at a small gathering at the pool, as well as moments of Carey modeling for her bikini photo shoot for the June issue of Vibe. The video's final segment is of Carey performing the song at a concert in a large theatre, while several photos are sporadically shown. Photographs of several of Carey's deceased friends and family members are shown, including her dog, Jack, her father Alfred Roy, her grandmother, David Cole, Luciano Pavarotti, Ol' Dirty Bastard, and Luther Vandross, all of whom Carey had collaborated with during her career. Critics complimented the inclusion of the photos with both Pavarotti and Vandross, and considered it Carey's way of honoring them. The music video peaked at #4 on Billboard's Hot Videoclip Tracks chart.|$|E
25|$|Blonde Lager is a light-bodied Munich Helles-style lager with a <b>grainy</b> character, a faint sweetness, and {{a bitter}} finish.|$|E
50|$|The texture is smooth, {{slightly}} {{thicker and}} <b>grainier</b> than clotted cream, while the colour is a pale primrose yellow. The fat content is typically 67-69%, which is comparable with rich continental cream cheeses such as mascarpone. Historically, {{it was a}} cheese for the wealthy, unlike the similarly-aged Crowdie, which is made from the by-products of skimming cream from milk and thus is considered a poor man's cheese.|$|R
5000|$|Kodak {{has defined}} a [...] "Print Grain Index" [...] (PGI) to {{characterize}} film grain (color negative films only), based on perceptual just-noticeable difference of graininess in prints. They also define [...] "granularity", a measurement of grain using an RMS measurement of density fluctuations in uniformly exposed film, {{measured with a}} microdensitometer with 48 micrometre aperture. Granularity varies with exposure — underexposed film looks <b>grainier</b> than overexposed film.|$|R
5000|$|Reviewing the 3DO version, Johnny Ballgame of GamePro commented, [...] "If {{you thought}} golf was boring, think again." [...] He {{was pleased with}} the {{selection}} of modes, accurate controls, and sound, and said that the graphics, though slightly <b>grainier</b> than in the PlayStation version, are stunningly lifelike in absolute terms. A reviewer for Next Generation found the game was an effective [...] "jump in and play" [...] experience, but lacked the realism and level of content that serious golfers would expect from a golf video game.|$|R
25|$|Hours later, {{video cameras}} sent down the {{borehole}} captured the first <b>grainy,</b> black-and-white, silent {{images of the}} miners.|$|E
25|$|Cystodermella cinnabarina is a {{basidiomycete}} fungus of {{the genus}} Cystodermella. Its fruiting body is a small agaric bearing a distinctive reddish-coloured <b>grainy</b> cap. It occurs in coniferous and deciduous forests throughout the world. Prior to 2002, this species belonged to genus Cystoderma, subsection Cinnabarina, under the name Cystoderma cinnabarinum which is still sometimes applied. Another often used synonym is Cystoderma terreyi.|$|E
25|$|Bond's book {{of street}} {{photography}} Point and Shoot, {{was published by}} German fine arts publisher Hatje Cantz Verlag, in 2000; many of the images included imitate forms of photography that are derided or taboo, such as voyeurism and paparazzi photojournalism; other images are <b>grainy</b> and suggest surveillance or CCTV images—the photographer is either an intrusive, prying, nuisance, or else reduced to an automaton-like spectator on daily life.|$|E
5000|$|Stephen Holden of The New York Times {{reviewed}} Black White + Gray, calling it, [...] "a potent {{exercise in}} art-world mythography {{that might be}} nicknamed 'The Prince and the Punk.'" [...] Vince Aletti pronounced the film [...] "fascinating" [...] in The New Yorker's Critic's Notebook, writing [...] "Savvy, charismatic, and devilishly handsome, Wagstaff found the perfect foil and goad in Mapplethorpe, {{but it was the}} collector, not the photographer, who left the most indelible and idiosyncratic mark on the medium they shared." [...] James Christopher declared in The Times of London, [...] "This is a terrific documentary by James Crump about the unsung collector, Wagstaff, and his lopsided relationship with his hungry young lover, Mapplethorpe." [...] Writing for Crave, Sundance Fellow and film critic, Ernest Hardy pronounced, [...] "Crump’s willingness to present a dissenting voice to what might otherwise come off as an almost fairy-tale pairing might seem an obvious directorial choice, but as documentaries slide more and more into blatant hagiography, it’s a relief to find a filmmaker inserting <b>grainier</b> perspectives for a <b>grainier</b> film." [...] Philip Gefter, a biographer of Sam Wagstaff, wrote about the film for The New York Times in anticipation of its premiere at the Tribeca Film Festival.|$|R
30|$|In {{the samples}} {{not exposed to}} light, color change was {{calculated}} relative to the first measurement, and the average of five values was calculated. Color change in exposed samples was calculated {{with respect to the}} average measured L*a*b* of the unexposed swatches. The value of ΔE in each set was almost always smaller than 1, and the average of six measurements was less than 1. Values from two replicates of each preparation were measured. The greatest variation was in the paint-outs of the tin-complexed samples, perhaps due to the <b>grainier</b> paint.|$|R
50|$|Relatively {{insensitive}} film, with a correspondingly {{lower speed}} index, requires more exposure to light {{to produce the}} same image density as a more sensitive film, and is thus commonly termed a slow film. Highly sensitive films are correspondingly termed fast films. In both digital and film photography, the reduction of exposure corresponding to use of higher sensitivities generally leads to reduced image quality (via coarser film grain or higher image noise of other types). In short, the higher the sensitivity, the <b>grainier</b> the image will be. Ultimately sensitivity {{is limited by the}} quantum efficiency of the film or sensor.|$|R
25|$|In 1993, Bond's short video work OTB was {{included}} in Aperto '93 at the Venice Biennale—a survey of international contemporary art. The short—which was looped and shown on a multi-screen system—showed <b>grainy</b> black-and-white footage documenting a flâneur's-eye-view of the day-to-day coming and going aboard the plethora of crowded Vaporetto, the waterbuses, in Venice; Bond's deliberately down-to-earth perspective depicting humdrum daily life in the city was intended to oppose the iconic glamorised images of gondolas, etc.|$|E
25|$|Maverick {{documentary}} filmmaker Kazuo Hara criticises the mores {{and customs}} of Japanese society in an unsentimental portrait of adults {{with cerebral palsy}} in his 1972 film Goodbye CP (Sayonara CP). Focusing on how people with cerebral palsy are generally ignored or disregarded in Japan, Hara challenges his society's taboos about physical handicaps. Using a deliberately harsh style, with <b>grainy</b> black-and-white photography and out-of-sync sound, Hara brings a stark realism to his subject.|$|E
25|$|Sand worms behave {{differently}} in Dune 2000 than in its predecessor. They {{can not be}} selected, nor their health is displayed. Their movement sight is more <b>grainy</b> rather than vibrating, and lightning bolts can be seen where the worm is. Their appearance is constant {{from the very first}} mission to the very end, and every multiplayer/practice map has 3 or more Sand worms (they can be turned off in multiplayer and practice).|$|E
50|$|The film imitates the {{appearance}} of films from Classical Hollywood studio-era. Most of the scenes were shot on soundstages and on Universal Studios' backlot, and were then edited with archival Russian footage and archived film from Corbis. Although the finished film is in black and white, it was shot in color because this allowed the use of faster film than available black-and-white film stocks, and afforded {{the ability to use}} 'green screen' techniques. The color was then reduced in post-production {{through the use of a}} digital intermediate to a <b>grainier</b> black and white, in order to blend with the carefully restored archival material.|$|R
50|$|Eetch (otherwise {{known as}} eech, itch, metch {{or one of}} several other variations) is a {{traditional}} Armenian side dish made principally from bulgur. It is somewhat similar to tabbouleh but much thicker and <b>grainier</b> (with far less parsley), and not as tangy. Its typical red colour is derived from crushed or pureed tomatoes. Common additional ingredients include onion, parsley, olive oil, lemon, paprika, and bell peppers. Eetch can be eaten cold or warm. A similar dish is known as kısır in Turkey {{and can be used}} in a meze. Eetch is colloquially known as mock kheyma due to its characteristics as a vegetarian form of kheyma.|$|R

25|$|The photos, {{taken with}} a cheap Instamatic camera, show {{what appears to be}} a male ivory-billed {{woodpecker}} perched on the trunks of two trees in the Atchafalaya Basin of Louisiana. The bird's distinctive bill is not visible in either photo and the photos– taken from a distance– are very <b>grainy.</b> Lowery presented the photos at the 1971 annual meeting of the American Ornithologists Union. Skeptics dismissed the photos as frauds; seeing that the bird is in roughly the same position in both photos, they suggested they may have been of a mounted specimen.|$|E
25|$|In Mexico, {{particularly}} in the towns and cities, corn tortillas are often made nowadays by machine and are very thin and uniform, but in many places in the country, they are still made by hand, even when the nixtamal is ground into masa by machine. In Belize, El Salvador, Guatemala, or Honduras, they are still often made by hand and are thicker. Corn tortillas are customarily served and eaten warm; when cool, they often become rubbery or <b>grainy</b> as the cooked starches stale. The largest tortilla producer {{in the world is}} the Mexican company Gruma, headquartered in Monterrey.|$|E
25|$|However, {{while it}} has flavor/texture {{components}} {{of each of the}} above, it is not prepared from a meat emulsion. Thus, it has the <b>grainy</b> consistency of cooked salami or kielbasa rather than that of bologna or hot dogs. In fact, smoked kielbasa might be the closest nationwide comparison. But, pork roll is a bit sweeter, and that extra sugar becomes caramelized when it is fried or grilled, which adds to the final flavor. Also, the tangy variety includes lactic acid starter culture in its preparation, which adds a sour flavor component like some dry cured salami's or pepperoni.|$|E

25|$|The regular-length version {{features}} Superfly {{performing the}} song {{with a band}} in an old Western-style stone building, overgrown with creeping vines. This version features a lot of added animation and distorted images, featuring black-and-white flames and bubbles. The art style features many <b>grainy</b> distortions {{in the style of}} a printed comic, and many patterns based on newsprint. Much of the animation focuses of images of soccer balls, which fly out of the television set in the room where the band plays, and out of the building's windows. Occasionally, the animations are only additions to the scenes, while other times the entire shots have been animated. At certain points, Ochi and her back-up band are represented as cartoons, and in others, Ochi performs the song with people in gorilla suits.|$|E
25|$|Brodovitch {{released}} {{a book of}} these photographs in 1945, titled simply Ballet, through a small New York publisher. The book contains 104 photographs of several ballets and is divided into eleven segments, one for each ballet performance. On the contents page, Brodovitch introduces each chapter in a typographic style that emulates {{the feel of the}} dance it is describing. He photographed with a Contax 35mm camera, no flash, and with a slow film speed. The blurred figures of the dancers allow the viewer to not only feel the music, but also to follow the line of the dancer's limbs mid-step. The images beautifully capture the atmosphere on-stage, the frenzied behind-the-scenes action backstage, and the magical moments of the ballet. By bleeding the blurred, <b>grainy</b> pictures off the pages and into the gutters, he communicated the emotional impact of the dance without words.|$|E

"Chuck Versus the Nacho Sampler" [...] {{revealed}} that the Ring was attempting to reverse-engineer the Intersect from damaged components of Intersect 2.0 they stole from the CIA after its destruction by Chuck. As part of this effort, they contracted a software engineer named Manoosh {{to develop a new}} Intersect. The results of the project were a pair of sunglasses that could [...] "flash" [...] an agent with Intersect 2.0 skills. Unlike the full Intersect, the portable version did not download into an agent's brain and was entirely self-contained within the device, however the extent of its capabilities are unknown, as the only flashes they have been seen to produce are on martial arts. The images during flashes were also <b>grainier</b> and not as clean as Chuck's. Manoosh ultimately destroyed his glasses when cornered, hoping that without a functional prototype, the Ring agents he was attempting to cheat would consider him too valuable to kill.|$|R

40|$|Effective forest {{management}} and conservation planning depends upon having accurate and detailed vegetation maps. Remote sensing {{has been an}} invaluable tool for mapping vegetation, but imagery alone often cannot yield detailed information on individual tree species. Because of this mismatch, there is interest in developing new statistical techniques for integrating ancillary information with remote sensing to produce a map. As part of a nationwide study, we are evaluating several variants of imputation mapping. Here, we compare the ability of two methods (gradient nearest neighbor (GNN) and random forest (RFNN)) to produce maps of tree species distributions at regional scales. These two methods make different assumptions about species-environment relationships and thus have differing strengths and weaknesses. We build the imputation models from 1778 vegetation plots from the US Forest Service’s Forest Inventory and Analysis program (annual plots), {{and a set of}} spatial data: a 2006 Landsat image mosaic, modeled climate (PRISM), and topographic variables, for a region that stretches from the Northern Oregon border into California, and encompasses the Cascade Mountains. Preliminary results show that both methods often predict species occurrence at somewhat broader geographic ranges, and a broader range of environmental conditions than they do within our original plot sample. Gradient nearest neighbor is more effective at producing range maps which represent the total area covered by a given species. Random forest predictions track species’ environmental limits more closely with the original data. However, some species are overmapped within their ranges, giving inflated estimates of total area within the mapped region. This tendency also yields different image textures. GNN produces a <b>grainier</b> map with higher edge densities while RFNN produces more compact patches. We conclude that model choice for mapping applications should be based upon intended use of the final map product, because each method has both strengths and weaknesses...|$|R
