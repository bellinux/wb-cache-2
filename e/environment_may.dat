5|$|Styracosaurus {{and other}} horned dinosaurs are often {{depicted}} {{in popular culture}} as herd animals. A bonebed composed of Styracosaurus remains is known from the Dinosaur Park Formation of Alberta, about halfway up the formation. This bonebed is associated with different types of river deposits. The mass deaths {{may have been a}} result of otherwise non-herding animals congregating around a waterhole in a period of drought, with evidence suggesting the <b>environment</b> <b>may</b> have been seasonal and semiarid.|$|E
5|$|Like live action, machinima is {{recorded}} in real-time, and real people can act {{and control the}} camera. Filmmakers are often encouraged to follow traditional cinematic conventions, such as avoiding wide fields of view, the overuse of slow motion, and errors in visual continuity. Unlike live action, machinima involves less expensive, digital special effects and sets, possibly with a science-fiction or historical theme. Explosions and stunts can be tried and repeated without monetary cost and risk of injury, and the host <b>environment</b> <b>may</b> allow unrealistic physical constraints. University of Cambridge experiments in 2002 and 2003 attempted to use machinima to re-create {{a scene from the}} 1942 live-action film Casablanca. Machinima filming differed from traditional cinematography in that character expression was limited, but camera movements were more flexible and improvised. Nitsche compared this experiment to an unpredictable Dogme 95 production.|$|E

5|$|Multifactorial sex {{determination}} occurs in numerous Neotropical species and involves both XY and ZW systems. Multifactorial systems involve rearrangements of sex chromosomes and autosomes. For example, the darter characine has a ZW multifactorial system where the female {{is determined by}} ZW1W2 and the male by ZZ. The wolf fish has a XY multifactorial system where females are determined by X1X1X2X2 and the male by X1X2Y. Some teleosts, such as zebrafish, have a polyfactorial system, where there are several genes which {{play a role in}} determining sex. Environment-dependent {{sex determination}} has been documented in at least 70 species of teleost. Temperature is the main factor, but PH levels, growth rate, density and social <b>environment</b> <b>may</b> also play a role. For the Atlantic silverside, spawning in colder waters creates more females, while warmer waters create more males.|$|E
5|$|The diving {{environment}} {{is limited by}} accessibility and risk, but includes water and occasionally other liquids. Most underwater diving {{is done in the}} shallower coastal parts of the oceans, and inland bodies of fresh water, including lakes, dams, quarries, rivers, springs, flooded caves, reservoirs, tanks, swimming pools, and canals, but may also be done in large bore ducting and sewers, power station cooling systems, cargo and ballast tanks of ships, and liquid-filled industrial equipment. The <b>environment</b> <b>may</b> affect gear configuration: for instance, freshwater is less dense than saltwater, so less added weight is needed to achieve diver neutral buoyancy in freshwater dives. Water temperature, visibility and movement also affect the diver and the dive plan. Diving in liquids other than water may present special problems due to density, viscosity and chemical compatibility of diving equipment, as well as possible environmental hazards to the diving team.|$|E
5|$|As most meat ant colonies {{rarely have}} a second queen, polydomy is not always {{associated}} with polygyny, although the two are frequently associated with each other because polygynous colonies reproduce by budding. This means that the ecological factors that promote polydomy and polygny both differ. Studies show that most meat ants are produced by a single, inseminated queen due to {{the high level of}} relatedness in all but one tested colonies. Colonies that are not closely related are the result of colony fusion (meaning that two unrelated and separate colonies form a single entity). Meat ants also show nest fidelity: in polydomous colonies, workers from different nests will always mingle with others from different nests but never return to a nest they do not originate from. Instead, they return to the nest they enclosed in. This means that colonies may only homogenise through brood transfer. As discussed before, nestmates from different nests will always be aggressive towards each other, but this is due to a number of factors: genetic and spatial distance in nests can correlate with the level of aggression exhibited by the ants. However, they exhibit more aggression to ants of different species from adjoining territories. They are also aggressive to conspecific ants from distant colonies, suggesting that environmental cues {{play a vital role in}} nestmate recognition. An example is that background odours in a particular <b>environment</b> <b>may</b> impair ants from identifying their own nestmates, and may need to make more attempts to determine an ant's identity.|$|E
