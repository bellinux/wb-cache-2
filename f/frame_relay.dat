2500|$|OSPF {{supports}} complex networks {{with multiple}} routers, including backup routers, to balance traffic load on multiple {{links to other}} subnets. Neighboring routers in the same broadcast domain or {{at each end of}} a point-to-point telecommunications communicate with each other via the OSPF protocol. Routers form adjacencies when they have detected each other. This detection is initiated when a router identifies itself in a Hello protocol packet. Upon acknowledgment, this establishes a two-way state and the most basic relationship. The routers in an Ethernet or <b>Frame</b> <b>Relay</b> network select a Designated Router (DR) and a Backup Designated Router (BDR) which act as a hub to reduce traffic between routers. OSPF uses both unicast and multicast transmission modes to send [...] "Hello" [...] packets and link state updates.|$|E
2500|$|DR's {{exist for}} the purpose of {{reducing}} network traffic by providing a source for routing updates. The DR maintains a complete topology table of the network and sends the updates to the other routers via multicast. All routers in a multi-access network segment will form a slave/master relationship with the DR. They will form adjacencies with the DR and BDR only. Every time a router sends an update, it sends it to the DR and BDR on the multicast address 224.0.0.6. The DR will then send the update out to all other routers in the area, to the multicast address 224.0.0.5. This way all the routers do not have to constantly update each other, and can rather get all their updates from a single source. [...] The use of multicasting further reduces the network load. [...] DRs and BDRs are always setup/elected on OSPF broadcast networks. [...] DR's can also be elected on NBMA (Non-Broadcast Multi-Access) networks such as <b>Frame</b> <b>Relay</b> or ATM. [...] DRs or BDRs are not elected on point-to-point links (such as a point-to-point WAN connection) because the two routers on either sides of the link must become fully adjacent and the bandwidth between them cannot be further optimized. DR and non-DR routers evolve from 2-way to full adjacency relationships by exchanging DD, Request, and Update.|$|E

40|$|The {{performance}} {{evaluation of the}} communications networks have been the main focus {{in the analysis of}} data communications in automated office environments. This thesis is aimed at the {{performance evaluation}} of different office communications applications over LANs which are interconnected via one of the latest fast packet switching techniques called <b>frame</b> <b>relaying.</b> Different LAN technologies have been examined, namely Ethernet, Token ring and AppleTalk. The T 1 (1. 544 Mbps) link and the 56 kbps link are used as a public services for inter-site communications. In this study, two main applications were considered: office communications which include different types of documents that pass across an office worker's desk (publications, messages, financial forms, and normal documents), and file transfer activities such as the transfer of X-RAY images or a medium size newsletter. The transfer delay, link utilization, packet size, and the number of workstations interconnected to each LAN are the main parameters used for evaluating the system performance. Results show that the 56 kbps link is best suited for office communications under normal conditions. However as inter-site traffic increases T 1 should be considered. A comparison of the performance of each LAN technology is given for both applications. The results of this study should furnish any office organization with strategic insight for the planning of its communications services...|$|R
