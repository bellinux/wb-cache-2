50|$|Acousto-optic {{modulators}} {{are much}} faster than typical mechanical devices such as tiltable mirrors. The time it takes an AOM to shift the exiting beam in is roughly limited to the transit time of the sound wave across the beam (typically 5 to 100 ns). This is fast enough to create active modelocking in an ultrafast laser. When faster control is necessary electro-optic modulators are used. However, these require very high voltages (e.g. 1...10 kV), whereas AOMs offer more <b>deflection</b> <b>range,</b> simple design, and low power consumption (less than 3 W).|$|E
50|$|Also with {{implications}} for the physical exploration of the Earth's interior is the gravitational field, which can be measured very accurately at the surface and remotely by satellites.

50|$|The {{summary of}} the {{investigation}} said the testing results for the VZ-5 were not favorable:The investigation showed that the airplane was unstable over the speed range {{and could not be}} trimmed about the actual center of gravity at 0.64 chord for the low speed. In order to provide a reasonable degree of longitudinal stability for the basic airplane configuration and a bare capability of trim over the flap <b>deflection</b> <b>range,</b> it would be necessary to ballast the airplane to move the center of gravity far ahead of its actual location. About 700 pounds of weight added to the cockpit area would be necessary to move the center of gravity the required amount. The airplane can develop a hovering lift of about 4,000 pounds which is approximately equal to its weight. The airplane had very high effective dihedral which, coupled with the certain directional instabilities, would be expected to produce highly undesirable flying qualities.”Since the VZ-5 was only ground and wind tunnel tested, exactly how those “undesirable flying qualities” would have become manifest in test fights never became known.|$|E

30|$|On {{the other}} hand, for production-manufactured instruments, current {{practice}} in the industry is to test the acoustic quality of a soundboard by measuring its stiffness across the grain during the manufacturing process (French 2008 a).

Based on the soundboard’s stiffness test, a brace from a collection of pre-dimensioned braces is chosen for that soundboard. A certain quality control is obtained since the manufacturer is aware of the range of soundboard stiffness for which their dimensioned braces produce decent instruments.|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to obtain time-dependent thoracic and abdominal deflections of an anthropomorphic test device, the WorldSID dummy, in oblique impact using sled tests, and compare with post mortem human subject (PMHS) data. To simulate the oblique loading vector, the load wall was configured such that the thorax and abdominal plates were offset by twenty or thirty degrees. Deflections were obtained from a chestband placed at the middle thoracic level and five internal deflection transducers. Data were compared from the chestband and the transducer located at the same level of the thorax. In addition, data were compared with deflections from similar PMHS tests obtained using chestbands placed at the level of the axilla, xyphoid process, and tenth rib, representing the upper thorax, middle thorax, and abdominal region of the biological specimen. Peak <b>deflections</b> <b>ranged</b> from 30 to 85 mm in the dummy tests. Peak <b>deflections</b> <b>ranged</b> from 60 to 115 mm in PMHS. Under both obliquities, dummy deflection-time histories at the location along the chestband in close proximity to the internal deflection transducer demonstrated similar profiles. However, the peak deflection magnitudes from the chestband were approximately 20 mm greater than those from the internal transducer. Acknowledging that the chestband measures external deflections in contrast to the transducer which records internal ribcage deformations, peak deflections match from the two sensors. Deflection time histories were also similar between the dummy and PMHS in terms of morphology, although thoracic deflection magnitudes from the dummy matched more closely with PMHS than abdominal deflection magnitudes. The dummy deformed in such a way that peak deflections occurred along the lateral vector. This was in contrast to PMHS tests wherein maximum deflections occurred along the antero-lateral direction, suggesting differing deformation responses in the two models. In addition, peak deflections occurred earlier in the dummy than in PMHS. These preliminary results are valuable in future crashworthiness studies...|$|R
5000|$|The first ohmmeters {{were based}} on a type of meter {{movement}} known as a 'ratiometer'. [...] These were similar to the galvanometer type movement encountered in later instruments, but instead of hairsprings to supply a restoring force they used conducting 'ligaments'. These provided no net rotational force to the movement. Also, the movement was wound with two coils. One was connected via a series resistor to the battery supply. The second was connected to the same battery supply via a second resistor and the resistor under test. The indication on the meter was proportional to the ratio of the currents through the two coils. This ratio was determined by the magnitude of the resistor under test. The advantages of this arrangement were twofold. First, the indication of the resistance was completely independent of the battery voltage (as long as it actually produced some voltage) and no zero adjustment was required. Second, although the resistance scale was non linear, the scale remained correct over the full <b>deflection</b> <b>range.</b> By interchanging the two coils a second range was provided. This scale was reversed compared to the first. A feature of this type of instrument was that it would continue to indicate a random resistance value once the test leads were disconnected (the action of which disconnected the battery from the movement). Ohmmeters of this type only ever measured resistance as they could not easily be incorporated into a multimeter design. Insulation testers that relied on a hand cranked generator operated on the same principle. This ensured that the indication was wholly independent of the voltage actually produced.|$|E

40|$|Between the 13 and 16 of February 2011 {{a series}} of coronal mass ejections (CMEs) erupted from {{multiple}} polarity inversion lines within active region 11158. For seven of these CMEs we use the Graduated Cylindrical Shell (GCS) flux rope model to determine the CME trajectory using both Solar Terrestrial Relations Observatory (STEREO) extreme ultraviolet (EUV) and coronagraph images. We then use the Forecasting a CME's Altered Trajectory (ForeCAT) model for nonradial CME dynamics driven by magnetic forces, to simulate the deflection and rotation of the seven CMEs. We find good agreement between the ForeCAT results and the reconstructed CME positions and orientations. The CME <b>deflections</b> <b>range</b> in magnitude between 10 degrees and 30 degrees. All CMEs deflect to the north but we find variations {{in the direction of}} the longitudinal <b>deflection.</b> The rotations <b>range</b> between 5 and 50 with both clockwise and counterclockwise rotations occurring. Three of the CMEs begin with initial positions within 2 degrees of one another. These three CMEs all deflect primarily northward, with some minor eastward deflection, and rotate counterclockwise. Their final positions and orientations, however, respectively differ by 20 degrees and 30 degrees. This variation in deflection and rotation results from differences in the CME expansion and radial propagation close to the Sun, as well as the CME mass. Ultimately, only one of these seven CMEs yielded discernible in situ signatures near Earth, despite the active region facing near Earth throughout the eruptions. We suggest that the differences in the deflection and rotation of the CMEs can explain whether each CME impacted or missed the Earth. Comment: 18 pages, 6 figures, accepted in Solar Physic...|$|R

Materials and Methods: Forty-eight cadaver maxillary and mandibular jaw quadrants were obtained Two titanium mini-screws were placed in each jaw quadrant and maximum insertion torque was measured. Each mini-screw was subjected to tangential force application oriented perpendicular to placement of the mini-screw and parallel to the occlusal plane. The force applied at each deflection was measured up to 1. 5 mm, but only the first 0. 60 mm of movement was investigated. This amount of displacement was selected to represent the amount of movement that would result in a clinically mobile mini-screw and potential failure.
