Sound planning strategies should be therefore pursued, employing a multidisciplinary approach that should take into account geographical, environmental and landscape factors as variables interacting among themselves and with the social and economic aspects. In order to simultaneously analyse all these properties, tools able to manage, interpret and integrate several data are necessary. The present research has been developed using a geographical information system applied to historical maps in order to assess the environmental impact of land use transformation, with a special emphasis on the atmospheric carbon dioxide balance. The analysis was focused on the transformation of a rural area in Southern Italy along the last 138 years, due to the change of and use through the introduction of corn and fruit orchards increasingly substituting olive trees and forested surfaces.

Ten patients were in the ''cold'' or atrophic stage of the disease process, whereas 46 were in the ''hot'' or acute phase. The scintigraphic parameters studied were the ratios of tracer activity in the affected side over the healthy side established for blood flow (BF), blood pool (BP), early vasculo-tissular fixation (EF), and late bone fixation (LF). In the controls, blood flow, blood pool, and early fixation showed considerable interindividual variation and only the variation of late fixation remained within narrow limits.

40|$|This Paper {{will focus}} on identifying, and look at {{potential}} ways of quantifying and valuing ecosystem services surrounding the cultivation of macroalgae. More specifically, the kelp species Saccharina latissima {{in the sea of}} Skagerrak at the Seafarm project. This paper is based on a literature review and case studies. Many ecosystem services have been identified and they were divided into the same four categories as in the Millennium Ecosystem Assessment report: provisioning, regulating, supporting and cultural services. To maintain a reasonable scope of this paper the most important ecosystem services were chosen. These ecosystem services were: All the provisioning services, climate and atmospheric regulation, regulation and mitigation of eutrophication and recreation and tourism. All the provisioning services, except reproduction of fish, are related to the amount of harvested kelp. The biomass can be quantified as dry weight (DW) with a relationship between DW and wet weight (WW). The method of quantifying climate and atmospheric regulation is in direct relation to the DW of the biomass. The study shows that the carbon sequestration on a cultivation site can be neglected and carbon stored in kelp used as food, fodder and fertilizer is released back into the atmosphere. Biomass used as biofuel prevents fossil fuel usage and should therefore be quantified. Provisioning ecosystem services are best valuated with the onsite valuation method. The carbon <b>fixation</b> <b>value</b> in climate and atmospheric regulation can be estimated with carbon credits and the oxygen production value can be estimated either with the assumption that it equals the carbon <b>fixation</b> <b>value</b> or with the replacement cost method. The value of mitigation of eutrophication can be estimated with CV and the value of recreation and tourism can also be estimated with CV but also with travel cost.  Den här rapporten kommer att fokusera på att identifiera, och titta på potentiella sätt att kvantifiera och värdera ekosystemtjänster kring odling av makroalger.

The ratios of directly measured nitrate and carbon uptake and the ratios of nitrate to nitrate plus ammonium uptake, i. e., values of f, agree well; values of f calculated from carbon uptake or from nitrate concentration are overestimates for the equatorial upwelling region. Carbon-to-nitrogen uptake ratios measured with C- 14 and N- 15, respectively, approximate the Redfield molar ratio, 6. 6 C:N.

Samples were exposed to fixed and fluctuating radiation regimes in an illuminated chamber at 15 �C (photosynthetically available radiation [PAR] � 66 Wm� 2;UV-A� 15. 3 W m� 2;UV-B� 0. 7 W m� 2), receiving either PAR � UVR or PAR only. A comparison between fixed and rotating systems showed that when ZUML/ZEu � 0. 6 (i. e., 60 % of the euphotic zone [Eu] was mixed), only postbloom assemblages (codominated by nanoplanktonic flagellates and diatoms [Chaetoceros spp. ]) were affected significantly by UVR.

Using a classic immunohistochemical method or ex vivo analysis of heart slices in dogs with acute myocardial infarction subjected to intravenous injection of unlabeled antimyosin antibodies or antimyosin antibodies labeled with indium- 111, {{it was observed that}} all antibody fragments specifically reached the targeted necrotic zone < 2 h after antibody injection and remzaineo bound for up to 24 h. In a limited but significant number of cases (5 of the 12 humans and 11 of 43 dogs), it was possible to image the necrotic zone in vivo as early as 2 to 4 h after antibody injection. In other cases, individual blood clearance variations retarded or even prevented in vivo necrosis detection. Higher antimyosin <b>fixation</b> <b>values</b> were obtained in the necrotic zones in dogs with a rapid blood clearance relative to that of the other dogs. It is concluded that antimyosin antibodies always reached necrotic areas within 2 h.

In some cases, however, uncontrolled individual variations in the timing required for sufficient blood clearance hampered this rapid in vivo detection of myocardial necrosis...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to determine whether genetically differentiated groups of Puccinia triticina are present in Europe. In total, 133 isolates of P. triticina collected from western Europe, central Europe and Turkey were tested for virulence on 20 lines of wheat with single leaf rust resistance genes, and for molecular genotypes with 23 simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. After removal of isolates with identical virulence and SSR genotype within countries, 121 isolates were retained for further analysis. Isolates were grouped based on SSR genotypes using a Bayesian approach and a genetic distance method. Both methods optimally placed the isolates into eight European (EU) groups of P. triticina SSR genotypes. Seven of the groups had virulence characteristics of isolates collected from common hexaploid wheat, and one of the groups had virulence characteristics of isolates from tetraploid durum wheat. There was a significant correlation between the SSR genotypes and virulence phenotypes of the isolates. All EU groups had observed values of heterozygosity greater than expected and significant <b>fixation</b> <b>values,</b> which indicated the clonal reproduction of urediniospores in the overall population. Linkage disequilibria for SSR genotypes were high across the entire population and within countries.

Images of PET/CT scans of the shoulder, hip and knee joints revealed that FDG accumulated at the entheses in SpA and in the synovium in RA patients. The maximum SUVs [mean (S.

40|$|During the {{culmination}} of the phytoplankton spring bloom in the Fladen Ground area in April-Mai 1976, gross primary production was between 1500 and 2000 mg particulate C m**- 2 day**- 1, at a crop density (mainly diatoms of the genus Chaetoceros) of about 1500 - 3500 mg C m**- 2. Estimates of the C:chlorophyll a ratio in living cells were much lower than those reported in the literature, possibly because part of what is measured as "chlorophyll a" by the common fluorometric method is associated with particles that are not reported as cells. Most of the dark 14 C fixation during the bloom's climax was due to abiotic processes. Excretion of 14 C-labeled carbohydrates did not account for a significant fraction of the total photosynthetic rate. The low crop after the bloom period, in June, corresponded with nutrient depletion of the euphotic zone. The low photosynthetic efficiency in June may have been a gross underestimate. The presence of relatively high concentrations of chlorophyll derivatives signifies that the algal crop was consumed by heterotrophs, but at a lower rate in April/May than during the June cruise when particularly high molar ratios of phaeophorbide a and phaeophytin a relative to chlorophyll a were found. The high respiratory rate relative to autotrophic production in June manifested itself also in high dark 14 C <b>fixation</b> <b>values.</b> The high concentration of phaeophorbide a in the upper 40 m and its scarcity below this depth during the spring bloom climax in April/May implies that copepod grazing at that time took place principally in the euphotic zone.

Research on mineral subsoils was carried out on Finnish peat production sites in 1997 – 1998 and 9800 hectares of peat production areas slowly getting exhausted were studied.

The area well suitable for agriculture or energy crop growing covered 26 - 42 % of the study - depending if boulder-poor tills were included or excluded. Even larger areas might be possible for agriculture if for example remaining peat layer was used for compensating physical features of the mineral subsoil. Approximately 11 % was recommended for mire regeneration because of sensitive bottom soils, but much larger areas were possible for mire regeneratio.

In the following article, a country (France is used as an example) without agriculture is studied in order to assess its nitrogen balance. Using a previously published model describing nitrogen input and output of a given country, nitrogen flows are identified. Inputs include deposition, fixation, and products not intended for agricultural use. Outputs are reduced to zero if agriculture disappears (in France, agriculture is the only sector exporting products containing nitrogen). All flows are calculated considering the hypothesis of disappearance of agriculture. Nitrogen requirements to feed people and pets in France are estimated based on medical and veterinary data (recommended daily amounts for proteins and/or usual average consumption). Indeed, most of the food that nourishes the French population is produced nationally. If agriculture stops, {{it will be necessary to}} import food from foreign countries. Results show an unexpectedly high excess (for a country without agriculture having a structure similar to France: number of human beings and pets) of 1. 5 million tons of nitrogen. An attempt to calculate an agricultural balance with the same data gives a result close to 3 million tons. Differences in French agricultural balances found in the literature can mainly be explained by values taken into account for deposition and <b>fixation</b> (<b>values</b> used here are at least 300, 000 tons higher than values used by the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development). In conclusion, nitrogen excess in agriculture is partly due to social demand; agriculture does not only produce food but also includes many other functions (landscape management, employment, and preservation of culture, for example). As a consequence, efforts that do not involve suppressing agriculture should be made to figure out alternative ways of production...|$|R
40|$|Background: People {{with visual}} {{impairment}} have reduced reading performance, which {{is thought to be}} related to unstable or eccentric fixation. New microperimeters such as the MP- 1 offer straightforward analysis of fixation stability. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the relationship between fixation stability and reading speed in a large cohort of people with diverse causes of visual impairment and to verify the correlation between reading speed and different methods for the quantification of fixation. Methods: The better eye of one hundred and twenty subjects was assessed. <b>Fixation</b> <b>values</b> were obtained from the MP- 1 microperimeter. Reading speed was evaluated using newspaper text with magnifiers if required. Results: The poorest fixation stability and reading performance was found in people with age-related macular degeneration while the best fixation was in retinitis pigmentosa subjects. A linear relationship was found between reading speed and the proportion of fixations within 2 ° (r 2 = 0. 51, p < 0. 001) and 4 ° (r 2 = 0. 36, p < 0. 001). A negative correlation was found between reading speed and all three bivariate contour ellipse areas (BCEA; for log transformation of 1 -S. D., 2 -S. D. and 3 -S. D. : r 2 = 0. 39, p < 0. 001). In a multiple regression model, proportion of points falling within 2 ° and 4 ° circle was significantly related to reading speed (r 2 = 0. 55, p < 0. 01; r 2 = 0. 43 p < 0. 01); also BCEAs values were strongly related to reading ability only in patients with central vision loss (r 2 = 0. 62, p < 0. 01 for LogBCEA 68. 2 %; r 2 = 0. 61, p < 0. 01 for LogBCEA 95. 4 % and 99. 6 %) and peripheral defect (r 2 = 0. 52, p < 0. 01 for LogBCEA 68. 2 %; r 2 = 0. 50, p < 0. 01 for LogBCEA 95. 4 %; r 2 = 0. 49, p < 0. 01 for LogBCEA 99. 6 %) but not in combined defect subjects. Conclusions: The study confirms that in people {{with visual impairment}} the reduced reading performance is correlated with fixation instability. Moreover, there is a strong relationship between reading speed and both the proportion of fixations falling within 2 ° and 4 ° and bivariate contour ellipse area values...|$|R

40|$|Margin {{analysis}} in breast surgery {{is an important}} predictor of local recurrence and can have vital impact on the postoperative treatment planning. Objective. The aim {{was to assess the}} mean reduction in the closest tumor-free surgical margin in millimeters of breast cancer specimens following formalin fixation. Materials and Methods. We conducted a cross-sectional study at the Aga Khan University Hospital from March 30, 2010 to January 20, 2011. One hundred consecutive breast tumour surgical specimens which had macroscopically visible tumour were included. The cancer type included both in situ and invasive cancers. Excluded were the patients who had previous surgery or systemic/radiation therapy. The closest tumor-free margin was recorded and compared with the margin after formalin <b>fixation.</b> P <b>value</b> of < 0. 05 was considered significant. Results. The mean age of our 100 patients was 53 years with the majority of the patients having undergone mastectomy for predominantly invasive ductal carcinoma. Following formalin fixation, the mean reduction of the closest tumor-free margin was noted as 2. 14 [*]mm which was found statistically significant. Conclusion. Considerable shrinkage of tumor-free surgical margins of breast cancer specimen was noted after formalin fixation. This inference can have implications on the postoperative management plan...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Allozyme {{variations}} {{were investigated}} by the electrophoretic analysis of 20 gene loci in 5 populations of Mesocricetus brandti and Mesocricetus auratus from Anatolia and Iran. Of the 20 loci analysed, 11 were monomorphic and fixed for the same allele in all 5 populations, 9 loci were polymorphic, and 1 locus differed between M. auratus and M. brandti populations. The overall mean of polymorphic loci for all the populations was 24. 7 % (range: 5. 9 %- 41. 2 %). The mean <b>fixation</b> index <b>value</b> was FST = 0. 0748, indicating a 7 % genetic variation in the M. brandti populations. The obtained FST values indicated that there are moderate genetic differences between the populations of M. brandti. The finding {{that the number of}} migrants (Nm) was 3. 09 also suggests effective gene flow across populations. The overall mean heterozygosity (Ho = direct count) for all populations (M. brandti and M. auratus) was 0. 069 (range: 0. 029 - 0. 118 at different locations). The mean heterozygosity of M. brandti and M. auratus was Ho = 0. 080 and Ho = 0, 029, respectively.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedHuman Systems Integration ReportThis {{study was designed}} to determine if future research into the development of an attention monitoring device based on eye fixation duration is both feasible and warranted. Attentional Drift is an insidious form of distraction where primary task attention is slowly eroded by secondary tasking. It can occur in either very low or very high cognitive demand situations. Recent studies have shown eye fixation duration and glance duration measures have close correlations to attentional demand in visual tasks. In this study, participants completed two 20 -minute driving periods in a STISIMtm based simulator wearing a head-mounted eye-tracking system. Eye fixation measures recorded in a single-task low mental demand test did not show a significant increase in eye fixation duration over time in all participants. A second test incorporating secondary task through varied types of conversation did show that eye <b>fixation</b> duration <b>values</b> were affected by thee added cognitive workload. Eye fixation measures showed statistically significant changes in duration as direct result of varying secondary cognitive demand. It is concluded that further experimentation incorporating eye blink-rate factors, utilization of a fixed-base eye-tracking system with a gaze dwell time function and significantly lengthened test runs is both feasible and warranted.

40|$|Taoyuan pig is {{a native}} Taiwan breed. According to the {{historical}} record, the breed was first introduced to Taiwan from Guangdong province, Southern China, around 1877. The breed {{played an important role}} in Taiwan’s early swine industry. It was classified as an indigenous breed in 1986. After 1987, a conserved population of Taoyuan pig was collected and reared in isolation. In this study, mitochondrial DNA sequences and 18 microsatellite markers were used to investigate maternal lineage and genetic diversity within the Taoyuan pig population. Population differentiation among Taoyuan, Asian type, and European type pig breeds was also evaluated using differentiation indices. Only one D-loop haplotype of the Taoyuan pig was found. It clustered with Lower Changjiang River Basin and Central China Type pig breeds. Based on the polymorphism of microsatellite markers, a positive <b>fixation</b> index <b>value</b> (FIS) indicates that the conserved Taoyuan population suffers from inbreeding. In addition, high FST values (> 0. 2105) were obtained, revealing high differentiation among these breeds. Non-metric multi-dimensional scaling showed a clear geometric structure among 7 breeds. Together these results indicate that maternally Taoyuan pig originated in the Lower Changjiang River Basin and Central China; however, since being introduced to Taiwan differentiation has occurred. In addition, Taoyuan pig has lost genetic diversity in both its mitochondrial and nuclear genomes...|$|R
