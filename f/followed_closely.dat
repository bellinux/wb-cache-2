5|$|The first rural {{cemetery}} in the United States—Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts—was {{developed in the}} 1830s. Rural cemeteries are burial grounds typically located {{on the fringe of}} a city that offer a natural setting for interment of the dead. The development of rural cemeteries <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> with the English garden movement of the early 19thcentury.|$|E
5|$|About {{one percent}} of people who receive {{treatment}} for MTBI need surgery for a brain injury. Observation to monitor for worsening condition {{is an important part of}} treatment. Health care providers recommend that those suffering from concussion return for further medical care and evaluation 24 to 72hours after the concussive event if the symptoms worsen. Athletes, especially intercollegiate or professional, are typically <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> by team athletic trainers during this period but others may not have access to this level of health care and may be sent home with minimal monitoring.|$|E

5|$|Chapman's fame as a cricketer {{made him}} a popular public figure; he and his wife, whom he married in 1925, were well known figures in fashionable society and their {{appearances}} were <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> in the press. Outside of cricket, {{he worked for a}} brewery. In his later years, Chapman increasingly suffered from the effects of alcoholism and was often seen drunk in public. He and his wife divorced in 1942; he spent his final years, mainly alone, suffering from depression, arthritis and a continued dependence on alcohol. Following a fall at his home and a subsequent operation, Chapman died in 1961, aged 61.|$|E
5|$|Garfield {{was carried}} {{back to the}} White House. Although doctors {{told him that he}} would not survive the night, the President {{remained}} conscious and alert. The next morning his vital signs were good and doctors began to hope for recovery. A long vigil began, with Garfield's doctors issuing regular bulletins that the American public <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> throughout the summer of 1881. His condition fluctuated. Fevers came and went. Garfield struggled to keep down solid food and spent most of the summer eating little, and that only liquids.|$|E
5|$|Harding's death {{came as a}} great {{shock to}} the nation.

Nine million people lined the tracks as Harding's body was taken from San Francisco to Washington, D.C., and after services there, home to Marion, Ohio, for burial.|$|E

5|$|Indonesia kept East Timor {{shut off}} from the rest of the world, except for a few years in the late 1980s and early 1990s, {{claiming}} that the vast majority of East Timorese supported integration. This position was <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> by the Indonesian media such that an East Timorese acceptance of their integration with Indonesia was taken for granted by, and was a non-issue for, the majority of Indonesians. East Timor came to be seen as a training ground for the officer corps in tactics of suppression for Aceh and Papua, and was pivotal in ensuring military sector dominance of Indonesia.|$|E
5|$|Integration {{failure is}} rare, {{particularly}} if a dentist's or oral surgeon's instructions are <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> by the patient. Immediate loading implants {{may have a}} higher rate of failure, potentially due to being loaded immediately after trauma or extraction, but the difference with proper care and maintenance is well within statistical variance for this type of procedure. More often, osseointegration failure occurs when a patient is either too unhealthy to receive the implant or engages in behavior that contraindicates proper dental hygiene including smoking or drug use.|$|E

5|$|New editions were readied as {{supplies}} of previously published editions were exhausted, {{even though some}} editions provided little change from the previous, as they were primarily needed to fulfill demand. In the next decade, three editions <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> on: the 3rd (1888), 4th (1891), and 5th (1894). Editions 6 through 11 were published from 1899 to 1922. The 6th edition was published in a record 7,600 copies, although subsequent editions were much lower. During this time, {{the size of the}} volume grew, and edition 12 swelled to 1243 pages, an increase of 25% over the previous edition.|$|E
5|$|Of this list's 90 pitchers, four {{share the}} best win–loss record (10), {{in terms of}} winning percentage: Ben Shields, Wayne Simpson, Paul Stuffel, and Rich Surhoff.

Short's 1,585 strikeouts also lead, and he is followed by Curt Schilling's 1,554. The lowest earned run average (ERA) is shared by Surhoff and Jake Smith; each allowed no earned runs during their Phillies careers for an ERA of 0.00. Two other pitchers have ERAs under 2.00: Frank Scanlan (1.64) and Scott Service (1.69).|$|E

After heavy fighting, Crittenden's division recaptured the Hornet's Nest area by late morning, but the Crittenden and Nelson forces were repulsed by determined counterattacks from Breckinridge. Wallace's and Sherman's {{men on the}} Union right made steady progress, driving Bragg and Polk to the south. As Crittenden and McCook resumed their attacks, Breckinridge was forced to retire. By noon Beauregard's line paralleled the Hamburg-Purdy Road.|$|E

5|$|A 2005 {{survey of}} 10,503 people in England {{over the age}} of 16 found that {{approximately}} 10% (1,049) had body piercings in sites other than the earlobe, with a heavy representation of women aged 16–24 (46.2% piercing in that demographic). Among the most common body sites, the navel was top at 33%, with the nose and ear (other than lobe) following at 19% and 13%. The tongue and nipple tied at 9%. The eyebrow, lip and genitals were 8%, 4% and 2%, respectively. Preference among women <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> on that ranking, though eyebrow piercings were more common than nipple piercings. Among male responders, the order was significantly different, descending in popularity from nipple, eyebrow, ear, tongue, nose, lip and genitals.|$|E

5|$|As a {{constitutional}} monarch, his education was <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> by the National Assembly, which demanded from Itanhaém progress reports concerning his studies. During this time, Pedro II was kept unaware of events occurring outside the palace, including political matters. News which did intrude upon the emperor and his sisters concerned deaths within their family. In December 1834, they {{learned of the}} early and unanticipated death of their father. A few months later their grandfather Francis II, who had shown great interest in his grandchildren, died (June 1835). These losses drew the emperor and his sisters closer together and strengthened their sense of family, {{despite the absence of}} their parents.|$|E
5|$|Aware of the British pursuit, Bompart {{nevertheless}} {{continued to}} the north. Countess <b>followed</b> <b>closely,</b> and was joined on 18 September by HMS Amelia under Captain Charles Herbert. Initially {{north of the}} French, Amelia had spotted the chase the previous day and caught up during the night by passing silently through Bompart's squadron. The next day, Bompart attempted to throw off his pursuers by feinting towards Lorient, and again the following day by feinting south, as if travelling towards the Antilles. However, the British captains remained on track, and by 20 September were only nine miles from Bompart's force, which was continuing south-west as though sailing for the Americas. HMS Anson, a large razee frigate under Captain Philip Charles Durham, joined the British force on 20 September.|$|E
5|$|In 1985, the International Union of Pure and Applied Chemistry (IUPAC) and the International Union of Pure and Applied Physics (IUPAP) {{formed a}} Joint Working Party (JWP) aimed at {{assessing}} discoveries and establishing final {{names for the}} elements in question. The party held numerous meetings with delegates from the three competing institutes; in 1990, they established criteria on recognizing an element and in 1991, they completed the work on assessing discoverer statuses and the party was disbanded. These results were published in 1993. According to the report, the first definitely successful experiment was the April 1970 experiment in Berkeley, <b>followed</b> <b>closely</b> by the June 1970 Dubna experiment; thus, credit for discovery of the element should be shared between the two competing teams.|$|E
