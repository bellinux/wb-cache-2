It is managed by two supervisors and staffed by a handful of <b>forensic</b> <b>identification</b> technicians and includes a fully equipped laboratory. They are now equipped with enough scene examination and evidence gathering supplies to investigate effectively.The <b>forensics</b> <b>identification</b> team is responsible for protecting, collecting, preserving, and analyzing the physical evidence. Their duties include the interpretation of trace evidence and recording of the autopsy process. The team has particular expertise in several areas of forensics, including collision reconstructions, scene mapping, and bloodstain pattern analysis. They also liaise with scientists at the Centre of Forensic Sciences in Ontario and other external experts for DNA analysis and ballistics.|$|R

40|$|Abstract/Summary The {{discovery}} of a cadaver or skeletal remains (hereinafter the "Remains") raises a number of questions, {{one of which is}} the matter of the identity of the remains. The answer to this particular question can be found through <b>forensic</b> <b>identification</b> and utilization of one of the methods thereof. The aim of my thesis is to provide a brief overview of the methods which are currently most commonly used for the purposes of identifying Remains and introduce the reader to their basics, options and limitations. In order to ensure {{a better understanding of the}} subject, I have included a section concerning the Remains and the post-mortem changes thereof. In this thesis, I will focus only on those parts of scientific fields, which are relevant for identification of the Remains, and, similarly with respect to information systems, I target only the information being collected and analyzed by such systems in cases of Remains whose identity is not know. In this thesis, I have chosen to proceed from general terms, division of <b>forensic</b> <b>identification,</b> activities being carried out upon the {{discovery of}} the Remains, to the individual methods of <b>identification,</b> <b>information</b> system and practical case studies. The thesis is divided into ten chapters. In the first chapter, I address the subject of general terms [...] ...|$|R

40|$|The {{ultimate}} issue rule {{has been widely}} criticised and has been abandoned in most common law jurisdictions. While its continuance is questioned in English criminal proceedings, this paper argues that there is scope for its survival {{in the context of}} <b>forensic</b> <b>identification</b> evidence. This paper refers to the standards for the formulation of evaluative forensic expert opinions referred to as ‘Bayesian approach’. The founding principles of this paradigm, initially associated with the successful use of DNA evidence in criminal trials, today are widely applied in many <b>forensic</b> <b>identification</b> disciplines. This paper highlights the major contribution this model makes by shaping up the role of the expert in a criminal trial to pronouncing on the weight of evidence and not to addressing the {{ultimate issue}}. By requiring the expert to evaluate the evidence and report on the probability of the findings under a set of propositions and leaving the determination of the probability of those propositions to the trier of fact, the Bayesian approach conforms not only to logic and reason but to the legal principles too.

40|$|A major {{application}} of Speaker Identification (SI) is suspect identification by voice. This thesis investigates techniques {{that can be}} used to improve SI technology as applied to suspect identification. Speech Coding techniques have become integrated into many of our modern voice communications systems. This prompts the question - how are automatic speaker identification systems and modern <b>forensic</b> <b>identification</b> techniques affected by the introduction of digitally coded speech channels? Presented in this thesis are three separate studies investigating the effects of speech coding and compression on current speaker recognition techniques. A relatively new Spectral Analysis technique - Higher Order Spectral Analysis (HOSA) - has been identified as a potential candidate for improving some aspects of <b>forensic</b> speaker <b>identification</b> tasks. Presented in this thesis is a study investigating the {{application of}} HOSA to improve the robustness of current ASR techniques in the presence of additive Gaussian noise. Results from our investigations reveal that incremental improvements in each of these aspects related to automatic and <b>forensic</b> <b>identification</b> are achievable...|$|R

To avoid miscarriage of justice, these principles need to be understood and safeguards employed so that the legal process is not contaminated by pseudoscience...|$|R
