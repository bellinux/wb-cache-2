2500|$|Flux is a {{reducing}} agent {{designed to help}} reduce (return oxidized metals to their metallic state) metal oxides at the points of contact to improve the electrical connection and mechanical strength. The two principal types of flux are acid flux (sometimes called [...] "active flux"), containing strong acids, used for metal mending and plumbing, and rosin flux (sometimes called [...] "passive flux"), used in electronics. Rosin flux comes {{in a variety of}} [...] "activities", corresponding roughly to the speed and effectiveness of the organic acid components of the rosin in dissolving metallic surface oxides, and consequently the corrosiveness of the <b>flux</b> <b>residue.</b>|$|E
5000|$|Residue tack - the {{stickiness}} of {{the surface}} of the <b>flux</b> <b>residue.</b> When not removed, the <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> should have smooth, hard surface. Tacky surfaces tend to accumulate dust and particulates, which causes issues with electrical resistance; the particles themselves can be conductive or they can be hygroscopic or corrosive.|$|E
5000|$|No-clean fluxes - mild {{enough to}} not [...] "require" [...] removal {{due to their}} {{non-conductive}} and non-corrosive residues. These fluxes are called [...] "no-clean" [...] because the residue left after the solder operation is non-conductive and won't cause electrical shorts; nevertheless they leave a plainly visible white residue that resembles diluted bird-droppings. No-clean <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> is acceptable on all 3 classes of PCBs as defined by IPC-610 provided it does not inhibit visual inspection, access to test points, or have a wet, tacky or excessive residue that may spread onto other areas. Connector mating surfaces must also be free of <b>flux</b> <b>residue.</b> Fingerprints in no-clean residue are a class 3 defect ...|$|E

50|$|In {{some cases}} the {{presence}} of flux is undesirable; flux traces interfere with e.g. precision optics or MEMS assemblies. <b>Flux</b> <b>residues</b> also tend to outgas in vacuum and space applications, and traces of water, ions and organic compounds may adversely affect long-term reliability of non-hermetic packages. Trapped <b>flux</b> <b>residues</b> are also the cause of most voids in the joints. Flux-less techniques are therefore desirable there.|$|R
50|$|For {{successful}} soldering and brazing, the {{oxide layer}} {{has to be}} removed from both the surfaces of the materials and the surface of the filler metal preform; the exposed surfaces also have to be protected against oxidation during heating. Flux-coated preforms {{can also be used to}} eliminate <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> entirely from the soldering process.|$|E
50|$|Ultrasonic {{cleaning}} is used widely {{to remove}} <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> from soldered circuit boards. However, some electronic components, notably MEMS {{devices such as}} gyroscopes, accelerometers and microphones can become damaged or destroyed by the high intensity vibrations they are subjected to during cleaning. Piezoelectric buzzers can work in reverse and produce voltage, which may pose a danger to their drive circuits.|$|E
5000|$|Some {{types of}} flux, called [...] "no-clean" [...] fluxes, {{do not require}} cleaning; their {{residues}} are benign after the soldering process. [...] Typically no-clean fluxes are especially sensitive to process conditions, which may make them undesirable in some applications. [...] Other kinds of flux, however, require a cleaning stage, in which the PCB is washed with solvents and/or deionized water to remove <b>flux</b> <b>residue.</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} mould <b>flux</b> <b>residues</b> on {{descaling}} of type 304 {{austenitic stainless steel}} were investigated, for simulated slab reheating conditions and hydraulic descaling. Several industrial and laboratory mould flux compositions and dosages were tested, {{and all of these}} were found to improve descaling substantially. This effect was associated with the elimination of the subscale containing nickel enriched metal tendrils and chromite (spinel). This subscale is characteristic of reheated austenitic stainless steel which does not have mould <b>flux</b> <b>residues.</b> In the presence of mould <b>flux</b> <b>residues</b> the subscale is absent, and nickel is oxidised and incorporated in a nickel–iron–chromium spinel which is close to the steel/scale interface, but separated from the steel by a layer of chromium oxide and molten silicate...|$|R

5000|$|Other solder defects can be {{detected}} visually as well. Too little solder {{will result in a}} [...] "dry" [...] and unreliable joint; too much solder (the familiar 'solder blob' to beginners) is not necessarily unsound, but tends to mean poor wetting. With some fluxes, <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> remaining on the joint may need to be removed, using water, alcohol or other solvents compatible with the parts involved.|$|E
50|$|Where many {{connections}} {{must be made}} in a {{short period}} of time (such as plumbing of a new building), soldering is quicker and less expensive joinery than compression or flare fittings. A degree of skill is needed to make a number of reliable soldered joints quickly. If <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> is thoroughly cleaned, soldering can produce a long-lasting connection at low cost. However, the use of an open flame for heating joints can present fire and health hazards to building occupants, and requires adequate ventilation.|$|E
50|$|Some fluxes for {{electronics}} {{are designed}} to be stable and inactive when cool and {{do not need to be}} cleaned off, though they still can be if desired, while other fluxes are acidic and must be removed after soldering to prevent corrosion of the circuits. For PCB assembly and rework, either an alcohol or acetone is commonly used with cotton swabs or bristle brushes to remove <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> after soldering. A heavy rag is usually used to remove flux from a plumbing joint before it cools and hardens. A fiberglass brush can also be used.|$|E
5000|$|Cleanability - the {{difficulty}} of removal of <b>flux</b> and its <b>residues</b> after the soldering operation. Fluxes with higher content of solids tend to leave larger amount of residues; thermal decomposition of some vehicles also leads to formation of difficult-to-clean, polymerized and possibly even charred deposits (a problem especially for hand soldering). Some <b>flux</b> <b>residues</b> are soluble in organic solvents, others in water, some in both. Some fluxes are no-clean, as they are sufficiently volatile or undergoing thermal decomposition to volatile products {{that they do not}} require the cleaning step. Other <b>fluxes</b> leave non-corrosive <b>residues</b> that can be left in place. However, <b>flux</b> <b>residues</b> can interfere with subsequent operations; they can impair adhesion of conformal coatings, or act as undesired insulation on connectors and contact pads for test equipment.|$|R
50|$|Salts are ionic {{in nature}} and can cause {{problems}} from metallic leaching or dendrite growth, with possible product failure. In some cases, particularly in high-reliability applications, <b>flux</b> <b>residues</b> must be removed.|$|R
5000|$|After soldering, {{the boards}} may be washed to remove <b>flux</b> <b>residues</b> and any stray solder balls that could short out closely spaced {{component}} leads. Rosin flux is removed with fluorocarbon solvents, high flash point hydrocarbon solvents, or low flash solvents e.g. limonene (derived from orange peels) which require extra rinsing or drying cycles. Water-soluble fluxes are removed with deionized water and detergent, {{followed by an}} air blast to quickly remove residual water. However, most electronic assemblies are made using a [...] "No-Clean" [...] process where the <b>flux</b> <b>residues</b> {{are designed to be}} left on the circuit board benign. This saves the cost of cleaning, speeds up the manufacturing process, and reduces waste.|$|R
50|$|Since {{copper pipe}} quickly conducts heat {{away from a}} joint, great {{care must be taken}} to ensure that the joint is {{properly}} heated through to obtain a good bond. After the joint is properly cleaned, fluxed and fitted, the torch flame is applied to the thickest part of the joint, typically the fitting with the pipe inside it, with the solder applied at the gap between the tube and the fitting. When all the parts are heated through, the solder will melt and flow into the joint by capillary action. The torch may need to be moved around the joint to ensure all areas are wetted out. However, the installer must take care to not overheat the areas being soldered. If the tube begins to discolor it means that the tube has been over-heated and is beginning to oxidize, stopping the flow of the solder and causing the soldered joint not to seal properly. Before oxidation the molten solder will follow the heat of the torch around the joint. When the joint is properly wetted out, the solder and then the heat are removed, and while the joint is still very hot, it is usually wiped with a dry rag. This removes excess solder as well as <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> before it cools down and hardens. With a solder ring joint, the joint is heated until a ring of molten solder is visible {{around the edge of the}} fitting and allowed to cool.|$|E
40|$|The {{cleaning}} {{process in}} the surface mount assembly line of power modules had been found to insufficiently remove solder <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> from printed circuit board (PCB) assemblies after the process of reflow soldering. This thesis details {{the development of an}} optimized cleaning process that effectively removes solder <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> from PCB assemblies. The first stage of this study involves the experimental validation of root cause of process ineffectiveness. A novel visual inspection based grading scale is developed to quantify the amount of residue present. Using the grading scale optimal process parameters were identified and studied. The study finds that power modules are most effectively cleaned in a saponifier based cleaning solution using ultrasonic agitation. Power modules are completely cleaned when washed in an ultrasonic bath at 60 °C for 7 minutes, in a saponifier based cleaning solution that is 5 % concentration by volume. by Ishan Mukherjee.

40|$|Abstract — The {{influence}} of no-clean flux residues on the perfor-mance of acrylic conformal coating used for {{printed circuit board}} (PCB) assemblies was investigated under aggressive exposure conditions using plain coated laminates and PCBs with comb shaped surface insulation resistance (SIR) pattern. Plain laminate substrate and SIR PCBs were cleaned or dosed with no-clean flux residues prior to coatings. Performance {{studies were carried out}} by total immersion in deionized water at 60 °C for 10 days followed by microscopic investigations and potentiostatic studies on coated SIR patterns at 12 V potential bias and by measuring the resulting leakage current. Foe both plain laminates and SIR patterns, detailed investigation of the corrosion morphology was carried out. The amount of water intake by the coating was calculated by the weight-gain method. The amount of no-clean <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> resulting at various temperatures was quantified using ion chromatography by extracting the residue, and sur-face morphology of the residues was investigated using optical microscopy. The <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> in general consists of both resin and activator components such as carboxylic acids.

5000|$|Corrosivity - the {{promotion}} of corrosion by the <b>flux</b> and its <b>residues.</b> Most active <b>fluxes</b> tend to be corrosive at room temperatures and require careful removal. As activity and corrosivity are linked, the preparation of surfaces to be joined should allow use of milder fluxes. Some water-soluble <b>flux</b> <b>residues</b> are hygroscopic, which causes problems with electrical resistance and contributes to corrosion. Fluxes containing halides and mineral acids are highly corrosive and require thorough removal.

40|$|The {{reliability}} of electronic packages is {{strongly influenced by}} the thermomechanical stresses developed during the assembly processes. Understanding the mechanisms of relaxing the high stress concentrations through the selection of materials with appropriate properties, adhesive joint and bump geometry will aid in design improvements for enhanced {{reliability of}} electronic packages. Finite element analysis is conducted to evaluate the stress profiles in a flip chip assembly that contains defects and delaminations at various locations. The residual stresses evolved due to the various temperature excursions during assembly processes are taken into account. Parametric studies are made {{of the effects of}} elastic modulus and coefficient of thermal expansion of underfill resin on residual stress profiles, especially at potential failure sites amongst the various interfaces. It is revealed that the presence of <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> at the bottom corners of solder bump does not impose a significant threat to the generation of stress concentrations, and thus the package reliability during the assembly processes and mechanical loading. On the contrary, the presence of delaminations along the solder-underfill interfaces caused more than twice the stress concentrations than those with perfect interface bonding and with <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> at the bump corners. It is proposed that these stress concentrations can be reduced systematically by optimising the material properties, e. g. by increasing the elastic modulus of underfill resin while decreasing the modulus of solder towards those of the underfill and PCB substrate. The effects of CTEs of package materials are discussed. An experimental study is carried out to measure the interface adhesion between various package components in the flip chip package. Although the adhesive strength of the underfill was found stronger with the passivation surfaces than the soldermask surfaces, from the mechanical loading viewpoint delamination was still prone to occur near the die side. The surface energy measurements indicate that for similar solid surfaces an increase in dipole hydrogen bond resulted in stronger adhesion of the joints...|$|E

40|$|The use of CSPs {{is rapidly}} expanding, {{particularly}} in portable electronic products. Many CSP designs {{will meet the}} thermal cycle or thermal shock requirements for these applications.

Issues of solder paste versus flux only, solder <b>flux</b> <b>residue</b> cleaning and reworkability are investigated with the capillary flow underfills. Fluxing underfills eliminate the issues of flux-underfill compatibility, but require placement into a predispensed underfill. Voiding during placement is discussed.

40|$|In recent years, a {{rapid advance}} in the {{electronic}} packaging and the growing market for faster, lighter, smaller, yet less expensive electronic products, the low cost stencil printing based on flip-chip has attracted attention. The low-cost stencil printing process consists of the electroless NickeI/Gold (Ni/Au) Under Bump Metallurgy (UBM), and the solder paste printing using the metal stencil mask {{on top of the}} UBM. The electroless plating replaces the expensive photolithograph and vaccum sputtering in the UBM formation process as a cost effectiveness consideration.

Because plumbing joints may be done at any angle, even upside down, plumbing fluxes are generally formulated as pastes which stay in place better than liquids.
