While {{the rest}} of Leeds has large open parks, this <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> city centre lacks and most free recreational space is contained within these squares. Since 2000, both City Square and Millennium Square have been redeveloped with hard landscaping. In an interview with Martin Wainwright, the northern editor of The Guardian, architect Irena Bauman, praised City Square for being a well designed and well used public space, however she criticised The Plaza Tower development for its lack of public space, stating that the only space made available was for service vehicles.|$|E

25|$|A September 2012 weapons {{technology}} swap {{deal and}} a July 2014 {{agreement on the}} sharing of defence technology were seen as preliminary steps towards Australian-Japanese collaboration on a submarine design, or towards integrating technologies like the Sōryūs Kockums designed air-independent propulsion Stirling engines and research into incorporating the Japanese boats' hydrodynamic capabilities into a potential SEA 1000 design. Advantages in such a deal between the nations include the attention that securing the SEA 1000 project would bring to Japanese arms manufacturers (particularly after loosening of defence export restrictions in 2014), the provision of a proven high-end submarine design to the Australian military, and improved relations, both directly and as mutual allies of the United States of America. However, it has been noted that co-operation on such a major defence project would be high risk due to Japan's lack of previous arms export experience, and any deal could negatively impact on both nations' relations with China. The close personal relationship between the then-Australian Prime Minister Tony Abbott and Japanese Prime Minister Shinzō Abe had also been cited {{as a factor in}} the likeliness of such a deal, although with the caveat that a change in government in either nation would compromise any potential deal for construction, or the ongoing maintenance support of the submarines: the Australian Labor Party has a greater interest in supporting local shipbuilding than Abbott's Coalition government, while a souring of China-Japan relations <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> Democratic Party of Japan is less likely to risk than the Liberal Democratic government led by Abe.|$|E

500|$|More recently, AllMusic critic Richie Unterberger {{has written}} of Yellow Submarine: [...] "The album {{would have been}} far better value if it had been {{released}} as a four-song EP... {{with the addition of a}} bonus track in [...] "Across the Universe"... No one would argue that there's a huge amount more than meets the eye (or ear) there, but listening to the original album anew 40 years on, one is still struck by how mostly second-rate, and recycled and rejected Beatles material still sounds so good." [...] Writing for Pitchfork Media, Mark Richardson opines that [...] "the Yellow Submarine soundtrack is like the work of a supremely talented band that couldn't really be bothered" [...] and describes [...] "Hey Bulldog" [...] as [...] "a tough and funky piano-driven rocker, [...] by a good margin the best song here". Richardson concludes: [...] "But as an album it's ultimately forgettable, which <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> Beatles so rarely were otherwise." ...|$|E
500|$|Despite this assessment, {{the end of}} the show's {{fourth season}} saw Hahn grow closer to {{orthopedic}} surgeon Callie Torres, in a relationship dubbed [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes has stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry. And watching the story unfold <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> writers are looking forward to. I wanted to illuminate their relationship in the same way we do all relationships on the show— it will be funny, sweet, honest, and a little bit dirty." [...] She has explained that in developing the relationship between the two: [...] "we wanted it to be real– not some stunt to get people talking. [...] We wanted {{to see what would happen}} if a woman suddenly had feelings for another woman." [...] The two characters shared a kiss at the end of season finale, with which After Ellen have noted: [...] "Callie and Erica became the only regular lesbian/bisexual female characters currently on network television. This is also the first time that two regular characters on a network show have begun a lesbian romance, as opposed to one becoming involved with a new lesbian character introduced expressly for that relationship." ...|$|E

In October 2007, National Geographic Cinema Ventures (NGCV), the entertainment division of the National Geographic Society, announced that U2 3D would be the division's first major international release. [...] Two days after the announcement, NGCV was combined into the newly created National Geographic Entertainment, a new unit within the society featuring various entertainment divisions. [...] National Geographic CEO John M. Fahey, Jr. stated that U2 3D was chosen as the new unit's first release because they felt that U2 is [...] "a band of the world" [...] and [...] "world music <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> Geographic as an institution is really interested in". National Geographic chose Best Buy as the film's American sponsor, and offered passes to select members of the retailer's loyalty program to view U2 3D before its wide release.

500|$|During E3 2015, {{the company}} {{announced}} Edge of Nowhere, a third-person action-adventure game for the virtual reality hardware Oculus Rift. In April 2016, {{the company announced}} two new virtual reality titles: Feral Rites, a hack and slash game, and The Unspoken, a fantasy multiplayer game, exclusively for the Rift. According to Price, the company began focusing on virtual reality projects as the team is enthusiastic about the technology, and that it allows the company to develop an expertise in creating VR game. The studio signed exclusive deal with Oculus VR as Insomniac believed that both companies shared the same passion to [...] " [...] games to life", and that they allowed Insomniac to retain the rights of their intellectual properties. Price compared the agreement to their previous first-party deals, and added that having {{the opportunity to develop}} games for the first generation of VR platform <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> team could not reject. Despite the new direction, Price added that they will not give up on making console triple AAA video games. At E3 2016, Insomniac announced their next AAA title, Marvel's Spider-Man, developed exclusively for the PlayStation 4 in conjunction with Marvel Entertainment. Bryan Intihar, producer of Sunset Overdrive, will be the game's creative director.|$|E
500|$|Ramirez {{described}} her character {{as someone who}} [...] "appears {{to be a certain}} way, but has some very complex issues going on behind the scenes. She seems to be a very strong personality, someone who really believes in herself and has worked very hard to get where she is. She's very competitive but does have a sense of self, so she doesn't need to win all the time." [...] At Torres' initial appearance on the show, she was disliked by fans, due to her {{getting in the way of}} O'Malley and Meredith Grey (Ellen Pompeo)'s relationship. When asked of this, Ramirez said: [...] "You do run across a lot of people who are extremely invested in that story line. Obviously, I've heard some negative stuff." [...] The end of the show's fourth season saw Torres grow closer to cardiothoracic surgeon Erica Hahn, in a relationship referred to by the portmanteau [...] "Eri-Cal" [...] and later [...] "Callica" [...] by Michael Ausiello of Entertainment Weekly. Rhimes stated that: [...] "Callie and Erica have an undeniable chemistry, and watching the story unfold <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> writers are looking forward to.

500|$|Even if the {{subject-matter}} {{of a case}} {{is generally}} non-justiciable, there are exceptions where the courts will still review the case. For instance, a dispute may prima facie involve a non-justiciable area but, on a closer look, the courts may decide {{that there is a}} justiciable matter within it. In such a situation, the courts will intervene and review the case. An example of this was given by Judicial Commissioner Menon in Lee Hsien Loong: [...] "here what appears to raise a question of international law in fact bears on the application of domestic law, that <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> court may well find justiciable." [...] In Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, the court similarly distinguished a pronouncement on the interpretation of a treaty generally, which is impermissible, from the consideration of [...] "the application of an international treaty by reference to the facts of an individual case" [...] which is allowed. Also, in R. v. Secretary of State for Foreign and Commonwealth Affairs, ex parte Everett (1988), the Court of Appeal of England and Wales took the view that a decision by the Secretary of State exercised under the royal prerogative to deny a passport to a British citizen residing abroad raised a justiciable issue because it was not a high policy matter involving foreign affairs but [...] "a matter of administrative decision, affecting the rights of individuals and their freedom of travel".|$|E

500|$|The game's {{characters}} {{were designed by}} Kimihiko Fujisaka, who had previously worked on the main Drakengard series. Two character designs for the protagonist were created for Nier. The developers believed that the Japanese audience would respond more strongly to a younger protagonist, while non-Japanese audiences would prefer an adult Nier character. Other than changing Nier's appearance and modifying a few lines of dialogue to fit with Nier being a father rather than a brother to Yonah, the developers made no changes between the two versions; while it was initially believed that the older Nier was the character's original design, an interview with Yoko clarified that the young Nier was the original vision. Many characters underwent changes during development, and some needed to be cut: there were originally thirteen Grimoires, with all but three being cut: those that remained were Weiss, Noir and Rubrum. Emil's character was derived from a female character named Halua, while Kainé was originally a far more feminine type who hid her violent nature. Yonah's original Japanese name {{was derived from the}} Biblical name Jonah: this could not be taken verbatim into its localized form due to the name being associated with a man, so the name was changed to [...] "Yonah". Kainé's character was made intersexual, since the team felt it fitted in with many other aspects of her gritty backstory. Kainé's status as an intersexual caused some commotion in western territories, which <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> team did not actively intend. Yoko attributed the original suggestion to female staff members working on the game.|$|E
500|$|McCarthy's plan to {{gain more}} delegates was {{complicated}} when Senator George McGovern of South Dakota entered the race as the successor to the legacy of Robert Kennedy. The entrance {{had the effect of}} splitting the anti-Humphrey vote. Meanwhile, the McCarthy campaign alleged that Democratic National Chairman John Bailey was giving [...] preferential treatment to Humphrey, to the detriment of McCarthy. They asked for the chairman's resignation, but he rejected the claims and argued that the two candidates were receiving [...] "exactly the same treatment in hotel space, amphitheatre space, telephone service, tickets, transportation and every other phase of convention activity." [...] As the eve of the convention dawned, Humphrey appeared to hold a lead over McCarthy among the delegates with McGovern in a distant third, but with many delegates still uncommitted, the three men battled it out. Meanwhile, on the streets of Chicago, anti-war protests raged as 6,000 federal troops and 18,000 Illinois National Guard defended the premises of the convention. Humphrey won the nomination on the first ballot, despite the fact that McCarthy had won a plurality of the primary vote. Riots intensified, and supporters of McCarthy urged the candidate to run a fourth party campaign against Nixon, Humphrey and George Wallace. He announced that he would not run such a campaign, and stepped down while denying an endorsement to Humphrey. At the end of his campaign, McCarthy stated that he [...] "set out to prove...that {{the people of this country}} could be educated and make a decent judgment...but evidently this <b>is</b> <b>something</b> <b>the</b> politicians were afraid to face up to." ...|$|E
