5|$|Wagner's early {{correspondence}} with Meyerbeer, up to 1846, is cringingly obsequious. However, {{from the early}} 1840s, as Wagner developed Tannhäuser and Lohengrin, his ideas on opera increasingly diverged from Meyerbeerean standards; even in 1843 Wagner had written to Schumann condemning Meyerbeer's work as 'a striving after superficial popularity'. During 1846 Meyerbeer turned down Wagner's application <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of 1,200 thalers, and this may have marked a turning point.|$|E
5|$|Another {{traditionally}} respected {{group which}} Joehana criticizes is the hajjis, those Muslims {{who have been}} on the Hajj pilgrimage to Mecca. The hajjis in Joehana's stories are generally greedy and lustful, without any interest in the good of humanity. In Tjarios Agan Permas, for instance, Hajji Serbanna displays his hypocrisy by damning usury as haraam (sinful) while charging high interest rates <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan,</b> and refuses to complete the mandatory prayers because he is waiting on a guest bearing large gifts. The hajji is portrayed as wearing so much make-up that, in the opinion of Kartini et al., it is as if he is deliberately dressing as a clown.|$|E

5|$|Behan {{testified that}} when he searched Tom McLaury for a weapon prior to the gunfight, he was not thorough, and that Tom {{might have had a}} pistol hidden in his waistband. Behan's {{testimony}} was significant, since he was a prime witness for the prosecution but had equivocated on this point. Behan's sympathy to the Cowboys was well known, and during the trial he firmly denied he had contributed money to help Ike with his defense costs. However, documents were located in 1997 that showed Behan served as guarantor <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to Ike Clanton during the Spicer hearing. Since Wyatt planned to run against Behan for County Sheriff, Behan had an incentive to help convict Wyatt.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{having the}} better chances, York drew 0–0 {{at home with}} Cambridge United, before being beaten 3–1 away by Wrexham, in which Wilkinson scored a late {{consolation}} goal. The club made an attempt to re-sign former striker Clayton Donaldson on loan from Crewe Alexandra, but were told to make an inquiry four weeks later, due to him being injured. York's first double of the season came with a 2–0 away win over Woking, the goals coming from Wilkinson and McBreen. Iyseden Christie's loan spell at Kettering from Stevenage was to be terminated <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> move to York to go ahead, but this deal fell through. Walker revealed {{he was interested in}} signing striker Bruce Dyer, shortly after he played against York's reserve team for Bradford City.|$|E
5|$|In 1902, facing {{cash flow}} problems, John Cleveland Osgood turned to George Jay Gould, a {{principal}} stockholder of the Denver and Rio Grande, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan.</b> Gould, via Frederick Taylor Gates, Rockefeller's financial adviser, brought John D. Rockefeller {{in to help}} finance the loan. Analysis of the company's operations by John D. Rockefeller, Jr. showed a need for substantially more funds which were provided in exchange for acquisition of CF's subsidiaries such as the Colorado and Wyoming Railway Company, the Crystal River Railroad Company, and possibly the Rocky Mountain Coal and Iron Company. Control was passed from the Iowa Group to Gould and Rockefeller interests in 1903 with Gould in control and Rockefeller and Gates representing a minority interests. Osgood left the company in 1904 and devoted his efforts to operating competing coal and coke operations.|$|E

5|$|In return <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> and a {{guarantee}} of Danish protection, Bishop Johann von Münchhausen signed a treaty on 26September 1559 giving Frederick II of Denmark the right to nominate the bishop of Ösel–Wiek, an act which amounted to the sale of these territories for 30,000 thalers. Frederick II nominated his brother, Duke Magnus of Holstein as bishop, who then took possession in April 1560. Lest Danish efforts create more insecurity for Sweden, Denmark made another attempt to mediate a peace in the region. Magnus at once pursued his own interests, purchasing the Bishopric of Courland without Frederick's consent and trying to expand into Harrien–Wierland (Harju and Virumaa). This brought him into direct conflict with Eric.|$|E
5|$|Solidarity lending is a {{cornerstone}} of microcredit, and the system is now used in more than 43 countries. Although each borrower must belong to a five-member group, the group {{is not required to}} give any guarantee <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to its members. Repayment responsibility rests solely on the individual borrower. The group and the centre oversee that everyone behaves responsibly and none gets into a repayment problem. No formal joint liability exists, i.e. group members are not obliged to pay on behalf of a defaulting member. But, in practice the group members often contribute the defaulted amount with an intention to collect the money from the defaulted member at a later time. Such behaviour is encouraged because Grameen does not extend further credit to a group in which a member defaults.|$|E
5|$|Swayamvaram marked several debuts—directorial of Gopalakrishnan, acting of the Malayalam star Bharath Gopi, {{and film}} {{producing}} of the Chitralekha Film Cooperative, an organisation cofounded by Gopalakrishnan himself. The film features an original score by M. B. Sreenivasan, camerawork by Mankada Ravi Varma, and film editing by Ramesan. Writer-director K. P. Kumaran co-scripted the film with Gopalakrishnan. It took seven years for Gopalakrishnan {{to get the}} project rolling when his initial proposal <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> {{to make a film}} was turned down by the Film Finance Corporation (FFC).

5|$|Already, General Douglas MacArthur {{had also}} been ordered to Australia. Brett {{received}} warning from the Chief of Staff, General George Marshall that MacArthur would call on him to send a flight of long-range bombers to Mindanao. The only aircraft that Brett could find were B-17s of the 19th Bombardment Group which had seen hard service in the Philippines and the Dutch East Indies campaigns. Brett approached Vice Admiral Herbert F. Leary, the commander of naval forces in the Anzac Area, to ask <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of some of twelve newly arrived navy B-17s. Leary refused. Brett therefore sent four of the 19th Bombardment Group's old planes. Only one, a B-17 with no brakes piloted by Lieutenant Harl Pease, made it to Mindanao; two turned back with engine trouble, while a fourth ditched in the sea, its crew managing to escape. MacArthur was incensed and {{sent a message to}} Marshall. A message from Washington, D.C. persuaded Leary to release four new B-17s to Brett and these aircraft reached Mindanao on 16 March 1942 and managed to bring MacArthur and his party to Australia. Despite the lack of brakes, Pease also made it back, carrying sixteen refugees.|$|E
5|$|An Ottoman army {{supported}} by Basarab Țepeluș of Wallachia invaded Transylvania and {{set fire to}} Szászváros (now Orăștie in Romania) in late 1479. Stephen Báthory and Paul Kinizsi annihilated the marauders in the Battle of Breadfield on 13 October. Matthias united the command of all forts along the Danube {{to the west of}} Belgrade in the hand of Paul Kinizsi to improve the defence of the southern frontier. Matthias sent reinforcements to Stephen the Great, who invaded pro-Ottoman Wallachia in early 1480; Matthias launched a campaign as far as Sarajevo in Bosnia in November. He set up five defensive provinces, or banates, centred around the forts of Szörényvár (now Drobeta-Turnu Severin in Romania), Belgrade, Šabac, Srebrenik and Jajce. The next year, Matthias initiated a criminal case against the Frankapans, the Zrinskis and other leading Croatian and Slavonian magnates for their alleged participation in the 1471 conspiracy. Most barons were pardoned as soon as they consented to the introduction of a new land tax. In 1481, <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of 100,000 florins, Matthias seized the town of Mautern in Styria and Sankt Pölten in Lower Austria from Friedrich Mauerkircher, one of the two candidates to the Bishopric of Passau.|$|E
5|$|As {{with many}} banks around the world, the Icelandic banks found it {{increasingly}} difficult or impossible to roll over their loans in the interbank market, their creditors insisting on payment while no other banks were willing to make fresh loans. In such a situation, a bank would normally have to ask <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> from the central bank as the lender of last resort. However, in Iceland the banks were so {{much larger than the}} national economy that the Central Bank of Iceland and the Icelandic government could not guarantee the payment of the banks' debts, leading to the collapse of the banks. The official reserves of the Central Bank of Iceland stood at 374.8 billion krónur at the end of September 2008, compared with 350.3 billion krónur of short-term international debt in the Icelandic banking sector, and at least £6.5 billion (1,250 billion krónur) of retail deposits in the UK.|$|E

5|$|He {{returned}} to Notts County {{to work as}} a coach and chief scout from 1968 to 1970.

In May 1970, he wrote to Chelsea chairman Richard Attenborough asking <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> of £250 and for possible employment; Attenborough lent him £100. He was interviewed by Eamonn Andrews on ITV's Today programme on his fall from England star to the unemployment line. After his financial troubles became public knowledge he was offered a lucrative job as director of his own subsidiary furniture company by a large furnishing company on Tottenham Court Road, however the company went into liquidation the following year. He continued to write cheques in the company's name, and in June 1972 pleaded Guilty to seven charges of obtaining goods and cash by deception. He was sentenced to three years probation, and ordered to pay £240 compensation and £100 in costs.|$|E
5|$|In 1927, when Syria was a French mandate, it was {{proposed}} {{to build a}} dam in the Euphrates near the Syro–Turkish border. After Syria became independent in 1946, the feasibility of this proposal was re-investigated, but the plan was not carried out. In 1957, the Syrian government reached {{an agreement with the}} Soviet Union for technical and financial aid {{for the construction of a}} dam in the Euphrates. Syria, as part of the United Arab Republic (UAR), signed an agreement with West Germany in 1960 <b>for</b> <b>a</b> <b>loan</b> to finance the construction of the dam. After Syria left the UAR in 1961, a new agreement about the financing of the dam was reached with the Soviet Union in 1965. A special government department was created in 1961 to oversee the construction of the dam. In the early 1960s Swedish geomorphologist Åke Sundborg worked as advisor in the dam project with the task of estimating the amount and fate of sediments that would enter into the dam. Sundborg developed for this purpose a mathematical model on the prognosed growth of a river delta in the dam.|$|E
