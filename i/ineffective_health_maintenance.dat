Para tanto, desenvolveu-se revisÃo integrativa da literatura, seguindo as etapas preconizadas por Whittemore e Knafl (2005). A busca e seleÃÃo dos estudos foram realizadas nas bases de dados LILACS, CINAHL, MEDLINE e SCOPUS. A amostra foi de 14 estudos nÃo experimentais, com nÃvel de evidÃncia VI. Os estudos foram avaliados e distribuÃdos em trÃs categorias temÃticas: diagnÃsticos de enfermagem em gestantes saudÃveis; diagnÃsticos de enfermagem em gestantes enfermas; e diagnÃsticos de enfermagem especÃficos. Em relaÃÃo aos resultados, os estudos foram publicados entre 1999 e 2010, eram brasileiros, tinham como idioma o portuguÃs, com autores vinculados Ã enfermagem. A primeira categoria foi composta por cinco estudos, dos quais foram relacionados 15 diagnÃsticos mais frequentes, relacionados a alteraÃÃes fisiolÃgicas da gestaÃÃo. Destacaram-se os diagnÃsticos Conhecimento deficiente, PadrÃo de sono prejudicado, NÃusea e Risco de infecÃÃo. A segunda categoria foi composta por sete estudos que investigaram a presenÃa de diagnÃsticos de enfermagem em gestantes com patologias, como a SÃndrome Hipertensiva da GestaÃÃo, a Amniorrexe prematura, o Trabalho de Parto Prematuro, a SÃndrome da ImunodeficÃncia adquirida, a Anemia Ferropriva, ou seja, gestantes de alto risco. Nesta categoria, os diagnÃsticos tenderam aparecer isoladamente em cada estudo, correlacionados com a patologia que a cometia as gestantes que estavam sendo investigadas. Foram destacados 33 diagnÃsticos mais frequentes, com Ãnfase para os diagnÃsticos: Conhecimento deficiente, Risco de infecÃÃo, Dor aguda, ManutenÃÃo do lar prejudicada, Ansiedade, Medo e ManutenÃÃo ineficaz da saÃde. A terceira e Ãltima categoria foi composta por dois estudos que investigaram como os DE Fadiga, PrivaÃÃo de sono e PadrÃo de sono prejudicado aconteciam na gravidez. Os diagnÃsticos retratados na revisÃo se relacionaram a aspectos biolÃgicos, psicolÃgicos, sociais e familiares das gestantes, o que vai ao encontro da necessidade de se investigar a gestante de forma integral, bem como de se prestar cuidado holÃstico a esta populaÃÃo e famÃlia. A presente revisÃo integrativa seguiu o rigor metodolÃgico adequado e identificou e avaliou os DE em gestantes. Ademais, permitiu aprofundamento teÃrico sobre a prÃtica baseada em evidÃncias, os mÃtodos de revisÃo integrativa, os diagnÃsticos de enfermagem e o processo de enfermagem relacionado Ã gravidez. Identificou-se a necessidade de se desenvolverem estudos quase experimentais ou experimentais, envolvendo a temÃtica dos diagnÃsticos de enfermagem em gestantes, visto que os estudos desta revisÃo foram classificados com nÃvel de evidÃncia VI. Entendendo-se com isto que Ã necessÃrio empreender esforÃos para o desenvolvimento de pesquisas com delineamentos que produzam evidÃncias fortes relacionadas ao tema, elevando, assim, o poder de generalizaÃÃo dos achados. Pretende-se com esta revisÃo estimular enfermeiros a consumirem resultados de pesquisa, bem como a produzirem pesquisas que resultem em uma prÃtica clÃnica de qualidade, contribuindo para promoÃÃo da saÃde de gestantes, seus conceptos e familiares. E, sobretudo, para a Enfermagem Baseada em EvidÃncias. This study {{aimed to}} search {{and assess the}} available evidences {{in the literature on}} the Nursing Diagnoses in pregnant women. For this purpose, we performed integrative literature review, following the steps proposed by Whittemore and Knafl (2005). The search and selection of studies were conducted in the LILACS, CINAHL, MEDLINE and SCOPUS databases. The sample consisted of 14 non-experimental studies with evidence level VI. The studies were assessed and divided into three thematic categories: nursing diagnoses in healthy pregnant women; nursing diagnoses in sick pregnant women; and specific nursing diagnoses. Regarding the results, the studies were published between 1999 and 2010, were Brazilians, in Portuguese language, with authors associated to nursing. The first category consisted of five studies, of which the 15 most frequent diagnoses were reported; related to physiological changes of pregnancy. With special reference to the diagnoses Knowledge, deficient; Sleep pattern disturbance; Nausea; and Risk for infection. The second category consisted of seven studies that investigated the presence of nursing diagnoses in patients with diseases such as Hypertension Syndrome of Pregnancy, Premature Rupture of Membranes, Preterm Labor, Acquired Immunodeficiency Syndrome, Iron-deficiency Anemia, i. e. high-risk pregnancies. In this category, diagnoses tended to appear separately in each study, correlated with the pathology that affected the pregnant women who were being investigated. The 33 most frequent diagnoses were highlighted, with emphasis on the diagnoses: Knowledge, deficient; Risk for infection; Acute pain; Impaired home maintenance; Anxiety; Fear; and <b>Ineffective</b> <b>health</b> <b>maintenance.</b> The third and final category consisted of two studies that investigated how the nursing diagnoses Fatigue; Sleep deprivation; and Sleep pattern disturbance occur in pregnancy. The diagnoses portrayed in the review were related to biological, psychological, social and family aspects of the pregnant women, which meets the need to investigate the pregnant woman integrally, as well as to provide holistic care to this population and family. This integrative review followed the appropriate methodological rigor and identified and assessed the nursing diagnoses in pregnant women. Moreover, it allowed the theoretical deepening on the evidence-based practice, the integrative review methods, the nursing diagnoses and the nursing process related to pregnancy. We identified the need to develop experimental or quasi-experimental studies involving the topics of nursing diagnoses in pregnant women, since studies in this review were classified as evidence level VI. Understanding that efforts are needed to develop researches with designs that produce strong evidence related to the issue, thus, raising the generalization of findings. With this review, we aimed to encourage nurses to consume search results, as well as to produce researches that result in a quality clinical practice, helping the health promotion of pregnant women, their fetuses and family. And, above all, for the Evidence-Based Nursing...|$|E
