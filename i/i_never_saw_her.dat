Melba Pattillo had acid thrown into her eyes and also recalled in her book, Warriors Don't Cry, an incident in which a group of white girls trapped her in a stall in the girls' washroom and attempted to burn her by dropping pieces of flaming paper on her from above. Another one of the students, Minnijean Brown, was verbally confronted and abused. She said I was one of the kids 'approved' by the school officials. We were told we would have to take a lot and were warned not to fight back if anything happened. One girl ran up to me and said, 'I'm so glad you're here.

[...] Susannah Wells's neighbours were turned away by the mob and her daughter and half-brother were quickly recognised and stopped. [...] However, three witnesses found in Dorset by George Squires, to testify for his mother, passed by unrecognised. [...] The first, John Gibbons, said that the Squires had visited his house in Abbotsbury [...] "with handkerchiefs, lawns, muslins, and checks, to sell about town" [...] from 1–9January. [...] This was corroborated by his neighbour, William Clarke. [...] Squires's last witness, Thomas Greville, claimed that he had accommodated Mary and [...] "her sister and her brother" [...] under his roof in Coombe, on 14January, where they sold [...] "handkerchiefs, lawns, and such things". [...] This was contradicted by John Iniser, a fishmonger around Waltham Cross and Theobalds. [...] Insier claimed he knew Squires by sight {{and that in the}} three weeks before her arrest he had seen her telling fortunes in the neighbourhood of Wells's house. [...] Wells, whose witnesses had been unable to pass by the mob outside, was able to offer only two sentences in her defence. [...] She told the court that she had not seen Canning before 1February, and that [...] "as to Squires, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> <b>her</b> above a week and a day before we were taken up."

6000|$|Mr. Walby {{proceeded}} to say that, under the circumstances, the trustees had decided on remonstrating by letter, after the examination; {{and it was}} easy to perceive that the reprimand, which might have been wise and moderate from the Squire, had gained a colour from every one concerned, so as to censure what was right and aggravate what was wrong. Mr. Frost's reply had been utterly unexpected; Ramsbotham and the bookseller had caught at the resignation, and so did the butcher, who hated the schoolmaster for having instilled inconveniently high principles into his son. Richardson abstained from voting; Mr. Calcott fought hard for Mr. Frost, but the grocer was ill, and only poor old Mr. Walby supported him, and even they felt that their letter had not deserved such treatment. Alas! had not Fitzjocelyn himself taught Northwold that the Squire was not a dictator? Even then, Mr. Calcott, still hoping that an apology might retrieve the day, had set forth to argue the matter with James Frost, whom he could not suppose serious in his intentions, but thought he meant to threaten the trustees into acquiescence. The doors had been closed against him, and Mr. Walby feared that now the step was known, {{it was too late to}} retract it. 'The ladies would never allow it,' he declared; 'there was no saying how virulent they were against Mr. Frost; and as to consideration for his family, that rather inflamed their dislike. They had rich relations enough! It would be only too good for so fine a lady to be brought down.' Every one had some story of her pride, neglect, or bad housewifery. 'And I can tell you,' said Mr. Walby, 'that I am not in their good books for declaring that <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> anything from <b>her</b> but very pretty, affable manners.' ...|$|R

Somebody [...] says,--a Mr. Soames, I believe it is,--that papa has taken [...] some money that does not belong to him, and he is to be [...] brought before the magistrates and tried. Of course, papa [...] has done nothing wrong. I do think he would be the last [...] man in the world to take a penny that did not belong to [...] him. You know how poor he is; what a life he has had!

To suppose that he [...] would take money [she had tried to write the word [...] "steal," [...] but she could not bring her pen to form the letters] is [...] monstrous. But, somehow, the circumstances have been made [...] to look bad against him, and they say that he must come [...] over here to the magistrates.

Of course, mamma knows that papa has done [...] nothing wrong; but she says that the whole thing is most [...] mysterious, and that she does not know how to account for [...] the money. Papa, you know, is not like other people. He [...] forgets things; and is always thinking, thinking, thinking [...] of his great misfortunes. Poor papa!

In vain did I refuse; in vain did I plead that if I were about to renounce the lady it were unknightly to seize on her inheritance. They would not hear me. They said it would serve as a door to England, and that it must be secured for the King, or the Dacres would hold it for York. They bade me on my allegiance, and commanded me to take it in King Henry's name, as though it were a mere stranger's castle, and gave me a crew of hired men-at-arms, as I verily believe to watch over what I did. But ere I started I made a vow in Dr. Morton's hands, to take it only for the King, and so soon as the troubles be ended to restore it to the lady, when our marriage is dissolved. As it fell out, <b>I</b> <b>never</b> <b>saw</b> the lady. <b>Her</b> mother lay a-dying, and there was no summoning her. I bade them show her all due honour, hoisted my pennon, rode on to my uncle at Wearmouth, and thence to mine own lands, whence I joined the Queen on her way to London. As you well know, all was over with our cause at Towton Moor; and it was on my way northward after the deadly fight that half a dozen of the men-at-arms brought me tidings, not only that the Gilsland Dacres had, as had been feared, claimed the castle, but that this same so-called lady of mine had been shown to deal in sorcery and magic.
