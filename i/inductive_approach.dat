25|$|The Aristotelian {{syllogism}} dominated Western philosophical {{thought for}} many centuries. In the 17th century, Sir Francis Bacon {{rejected the idea}} of syllogism as being {{the best way to}} draw conclusions in nature. Instead, Bacon proposed a more <b>inductive</b> <b>approach</b> to the observation of nature, which involves experimentation and leads to discovering and building on axioms to create a more general conclusion.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{scientific}} method as conceived in the 17th century, natural and artificial circumstances were set aside as a research tradition of systematic experimentation was slowly accepted by {{the scientific}} community. The philosophy of using an <b>inductive</b> <b>approach</b> to obtain knowledge — to abandon assumption and to attempt to observe {{with an open mind}} — was in contrast with the earlier, Aristotelian approach of deduction, by which analysis of known facts produced further understanding. In practice, many scientists and philosophers believed that a healthy mix of both was needed — the willingness to question assumptions, yet also to interpret observations assumed to have some degree of validity.|$|E
2500|$|Challenged by Alfred North Whitehead {{during a}} casual {{discussion}} while at Harvard {{to provide an}} account of a randomly provided piece of verbal behavior, Skinner set about attempting to extend his then-new functional, <b>inductive</b> <b>approach</b> {{to the complexity of}} human verbal behavior. Developed over two decades, his work appeared in the book Verbal Behavior. Although Noam Chomsky was highly critical of Verbal Behavior, he conceded that Skinner's [...] "S-R psychology" [...] was worth a review. (Behavior analysts reject the [...] "S-R" [...] characterization: operant conditioning involves the emission of a response which then becomes more or less likely depending upon its consequence–see above.).|$|E

40|$|We {{study the}} {{standard}} retrieval task of ranking a fixed set of items given a previously unseen query and pose {{it as the}} half transductive ranking problem. The task is transductive as the set of items is fixed. Transductive representations (where the vector representation of each example is learned) allow the generation of highly nonlinear embeddings that capture object relationships without relying on a specific choice of features, and require only relatively simple optimization. Unfortunately, they have no direct outof-sample extension. <b>Inductive</b> <b>approaches</b> {{on the other hand}} allow for the representation of unknown queries. We describe algorithms for this setting which have the advantages of both transductive and <b>inductive</b> <b>approaches,</b> and can be applied in unsupervised (either reconstruction-based or graph-based) and supervised ranking setups. We show empirically that our methods give strong performance on all three tasks. ...|$|R

40|$|Software {{processes}} play {{important role}} in overall business performances of software organizations. However, in many cases processes are not well established, leading to poor performances of software products and services. Since majority of software organizations are small, suffering {{from the lack of}} resources, there is a permanent need for developing lightweight <b>inductive</b> <b>approaches</b> for assessing and improving their processes. These approaches should start from the actual state of the practice in software organizations, and result with the most suitable improvement proposals. This paper presents a short introduction into software processes, process assessment and improvement, and motivation for investigating the field of inductive software process assessment.

We classify existing <b>approaches</b> into <b>inductive</b> and transductive <b>approaches,</b> and into local and global approaches. As of yet, among the group of <b>inductive</b> <b>approaches,</b> only local ones have been proposed. We here introduce a protein description formalism that also includes global information, namely information that locates a protein relative to speciﬁc other proteins in the network. The method is benchmarked on the well-established MIPS dataset {{and we found that}} on this dataset classiﬁcation according to ROC values indeed improves by 5 percent over the benchmark methods employed. status: publishe...|$|R

50|$|Experimental {{aesthetics}} is a {{field of}} psychology founded by Gustav Theodor Fechner in the 19th century. According to Fechner, aesthetics is an experiential perception which is empirically comprehensible {{in light of the}} characteristics of the subject undergoing the experience and those of the object. Experimental aesthetics is thus characterized by a subject-based, <b>inductive</b> <b>approach.</b> It is defined as part of empirical aesthetics, in which causal hypotheses are tested by experiments.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. In {{this work}} 1 we obtain robust category-based {{language}} models {{to be integrated}} into speech recognition systems. Deductive rules are used to select linguistic categories and to match words with categories. Statistical techniques are then used to build n-gram Language Models based on lexicons that consist of sets of categories. The categorization procedure and the language model evaluation were carried out on a taskoriented Spanish corpus. The cooperation between deductive and <b>inductive</b> <b>approaches</b> has proved efficient in building small, reliable language models for speech understanding purposes. ...|$|R

This paper presents the results from an exploratory study on the processes that motivate initial hypothesis-making and their possible repercussions for L 2 instruction. More specifically, the beginner foreign language learners’ ability to infer word meaning based on their overall linguistic knowledge (e. g., knowledge of the first language, knowledge of other foreign languages) was tested in order to draw conclusions about abductive reasoning in L 2 learning...|$|R

We find that politeness triples reply rates in some technical groups, but rudeness is more effective in others.

50|$|Newton's work {{became a}} model that other {{sciences}} sought to emulate, and his <b>inductive</b> <b>approach</b> {{formed the basis for}} much of natural philosophy through the 18th and early 19th centuries. Some methods of reasoning were later systematized by Mill's Methods (or Mill's canon), which are five explicit statements of what can be discarded and what can be kept while building a hypothesis. George Boole and William Stanley Jevons also wrote on the principles of reasoning.|$|E
5000|$|The hypothetico-deductive {{approach}} {{contrasts with}} other research models {{such as the}} <b>inductive</b> <b>approach</b> or grounded theory. In the data percolation methodology, the hypothetico-deductive approach is included in a paradigm of pragmatism by which four types of relations between the variables can exist: descriptive, of influence, longitudinal or causal. The variables are classified in two groups, structural and functional, a classification that drives the formulation of hypotheses and the statistical tests to be perfomed on the data so as {{to increase the efficiency}} of the research.|$|E
50|$|The {{field of}} {{experimental}} aesthetics {{was founded by}} Gustav Theodor Fechner in the 19th century.

In particular, the perception of works of art, music, or modern items such as websites or other IT products is studied. Experimental aesthetics is strongly oriented towards the natural sciences. Modern approaches mostly come from the fields of cognitive psychology or neuroscience (neuroaesthetics).|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT: Teaching grammar {{has been}} {{regarded}} as crucial {{to the ability to}} use language. For this reason, this article introduces a five-step procedure for teaching grammar. I have developed this procedure, which incorporates the notions of practice and consciousness-raising, explicit and implicit knowledge, and deductive and <b>inductive</b> <b>approaches</b> for teaching grammar. This procedure has been derived from my great interest in innovative grammar teaching and my teaching experience in grammar. The proposed steps are expected to be an alternative pathway for English teachers to teach grammar, particularly teaching tenses and modals at college-university levels or even in secondary schools...|$|R
