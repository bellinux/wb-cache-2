25|$|Human {{security}} can {{be defined}} as one of the foundational conditions of being human, including both (1) the sustainable protection and provision of the material conditions for meeting the embodied needs of people, and (2) the protection of the variable existential conditions for maintaining a dignified life. Within this definition it then makes sense that the core focus of human-security endeavours should be on the most vulnerable. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> risk management should be most responsive to immediate events or processes that have both an extensive and intensive impact in producing material and existential vulnerabilities of people in general or a category of persons across a particular locale.|$|E

25|$|There {{are also}} {{important}} differences between the Masoretic and Samaritan version of the Pentateuch in the readings of many sentences. Some distinctions seem motivated by (or reflect) actual philosophical differences between Judaism and Samaritanism. Some of these are glaringly obvious, like {{the inclusion of a}} passage in the Samaritan version of the Ten Commandments that restates the command to build an altar on Mt. Gerizim, and says plainly that Mt. Gerizim is the site where all future sacrifices must be offered. Since the location of God's holy site is probably the central original difference between Judaism and Samaritanism, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> this passage is in one version and not the other.|$|E
25|$|There {{are some}} {{morphological}} differences between queens and workers of P. sericea. Generally, queens {{are larger than}} workers in the abdominal region, but have smaller head width and wing length. Queens {{are the only ones}} with well-developed ovarioles, mature oocytes and sperm-filled spermathecae. Workers' ovaries are either underdeveloped or not developed at all, and so they are not reproductive. Queens perform the reproductive tasks of the colony, while workers forage for resources such as food and nest-building materials. Thus, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> workers would have larger brains and wings because they must hunt and forage for food. The morphological differences seen in this caste differentiation are also seen with the species Protopolybia chartergoides and Polybia rejecta.|$|E
25|$|The migratory {{ability is}} ranked {{tertiary}} > secondary > aryl > primary. Allylic groups {{are more apt}} to migrate than primary alkyl groups but less so than secondary alkyl groups. Electron-withdrawing groups on the substituent decrease the rate of migration. There are two explanations for this trend in migration ability. One explanation relies on the buildup of positive charge in the transition state for breakdown of the Criegee intermediate (illustrated by the carbocation resonance structure of the Criegee intermediate). Keeping this structure in mind, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the substituent that can maintain positive charge the best would be most likely to migrate. The higher the degree of substitution, the more stable a carbocation generally is. Therefore, the tertiary > secondary > primary trend is observed.|$|E

25|$|Considerable {{work has}} been {{published}} {{on the evolution of}} ant dulosis and almost all of it has at least some empirical evidence to defend its positions. Notably, that nearly all raiding ant species have is an adaptation of their mandibles that make them big or piercing or both. <b>It</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the very thing that enables an ant to be a better raider causes that same ant to become dependent on others; the parasite loses the use of its mandibles for actual work. On this and other evidence, it has been proposed that predation is the precursor to slavery. It has also been suggested that colony multiplication by adoption and budding followed by temporary parasitism can lead to dulosis. While observations indicate that colony multiplication can lead to temporary parasitism, it is apparently very questionable that temporary parasitism leads to dulosis.|$|E
25|$|Simultaneously, Mary F. Lyon began {{investigating}} {{manipulations of}} X-linked traits that had phenotypically visible consequences, particularly in mice, whose fur color is a trait intimately {{linked to the}} X chromosome. Building on work done by Ohno and his colleagues, Lyon eventually proved that either the maternal or paternal X chromosome is randomly inactivated in every cell of the female body in the species she was studying, which explained the heterogeneous fur patterns she observed in her mosaic mice. This process is known as X-inactivation, and is {{sometimes referred to as}} “lyonization”. This discovery can be easily extrapolated to explain the mixed color patterns observed in the coats of tortoiseshell cats. The fur patterns characteristic of tortoiseshell cats are found almost exclusively in females, because only they randomly inactivate one X chromosome in every somatic hair cell. Thus, presuming that hair color determining genes are X-linked, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> whether the maternal or paternal X chromosome is inactivated in a particular hair cell can result in differential fur color expression.|$|E
500|$|Drake has a {{distinct}} personality, as the creators did {{not want him to}} appear as a caricature or [...] "cardboard cutout". Hennig constantly elaborated Drake's personality through in-game dialogue and interactions with other characters, rather than exclusively through cutaway scenes. Drake reacts to events in a human-like way, often commenting and complaining on the absurdity or difficulty of his situation. While traveling through chapters, Drake frequently makes sarcastic quips and taunts. Self-educated in history and various languages, Drake is also highly intelligent. Matt Casamassina of IGN commented on the character's interactions during gameplay that reveal Drake's nature: [...] "it's lighthearted and amusing, but it also demonstrates that Nate is aware of how absurd his predicaments sometimes are. It's a small, unimportant communication, but <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the two would behave exactly as they do." ...|$|E

In the 2006 revival, the number was made with Mae (Joyce Chittick), instead of Gladys. Kathleen Marshall explains: [...] "Hines accuses Gladys of being a flirt, and she's not. So does <b>it</b> <b>make</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> she'd go and strut her stuff {{in front of the}} whole union? Hines would say, 'Aha, you floozy, I caught you!' Also, she's the boss's secretary, so why would she be at a union meeting?

That is where I think it stems from with her father leaving her, losing her sister, her mom sleeping with her sister’s boyfriend, etc. There are just so many traumatic things! Explaining her reaction to Steffy killing her cousin Aly Forrester (Ashlyn Pearce) in self-defense, Wood stated in August 2015: [...] "When I first heard about it, I was in major shock, of course. Then I started thinking about how everything bad happens to Steffy and that <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> she's a murderer now. It's kind of perfect, really." ...|$|E
500|$|In First Contact, the {{individually}} inscrutable and faceless Borg {{fulfill the}} role of the similarly unreadable whale in Melville's work. Picard, like Ahab, has been hurt by his nemesis, and author Elizabeth Hinds said <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> Picard should [...] "opt for the perverse alternative of remaining on board ship to fight" [...] the Borg rather than take the only sensible option left, to destroy the ship. Several lines in the film refer to the 21st-century dwellers being primitive, with the people of the 24th century having evolved to a more utopian society. In the end it is Lily (the 21st-century woman) who shows Picard (the 24th-century man) that his quest for revenge is the primitive behavior that humans had evolved to not use. Lily's words cause Picard to reconsider, and he quotes Ahab's words of vengeance, recognizing the death wish embedded therein.|$|E

2500|$|Remark: Some intuition for {{the mean}} ergodic theorem can be {{developed}} by considering the case where complex numbers of unit length are regarded as unitary transformations on the complex plane (by left multiplication). If we pick a single complex number of unit length (which {{we think of as}} U), it is intuitive that its powers will fill up the circle. Since the circle is symmetric around 0, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> the averages of the powers of U will converge to 0.

2500|$|Because {{there is}} this {{apparent}} focus on the absent person, it seems logical that physical descriptions play into the remembrance of the absent. It is quite obvious that the body is the focus in this poem. There are 14 references to body parts (eye and heart). While the body was not an exploited object in Renaissance times, it was a focus of love nonetheless. Lever notes that it was commonplace of romance [...] "entered through the eyes and penetrated to the heart." [...] Furthermore, [...] "Renaissance fancy…developed the conceit, with love engraving upon the heart the lady's image. The engraving became a portrait, with the eyes as windows through which it could be seen." [...] In a time when courtship was more formal and suitors or lovers were viewed from afar, <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> one would struggle with relying on the eye for physical knowledge of the other, but need the heart to fully read and connect to the person.|$|E
2500|$|That is, {{to combine}} n data points with total {{precision}} of nτ (or equivalently, total variance of n/σ2) and mean of values , derive a new total precision simply {{by adding the}} total precision of the data to the prior total precision, and form a new mean through a precision-weighted average, i.e. a weighted average of the data mean and the prior mean, each weighted by the associated total precision. This makes logical sense if the precision is thought of as indicating the certainty of the observations: In {{the distribution of the}} posterior mean, each of the input components is weighted by its certainty, and the certainty of this distribution is the sum of the individual certainties. (For the intuition of this, compare the expression [...] "the whole is (or is not) greater {{than the sum of its}} parts". [...] In addition, consider that the knowledge of the posterior comes from a combination of the knowledge of the prior and likelihood, so <b>it</b> <b>makes</b> <b>sense</b> <b>that</b> we are more certain of it than of either of its components.) ...|$|E
