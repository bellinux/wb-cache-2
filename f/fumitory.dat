60|$|Starting at 10 a.m., we did {{not reach}} the top till 3.30 p.m.; we had halted nowhere, but the last few miles had been most laborious, {{and the three of}} us who gained the summit were utterly knocked up. Fortunately I carried my own barometer; it {{indicated}} 16.206 inches, giving by comparative observations with Calcutta 16,764 feet, and with Dorjiling, 16,748 feet, as the height of the pass. The thermometer stood at 18 degrees, and the sun being now hidden behind rocks, the south-east wind was bitterly cold. Hitherto the sun had appeared as a clearly defined sparkling globe, against a dark- blue sky; but the depth of the azure blue was not so striking as I had been led to suppose, by the accounts of previous travellers, in very lofty regions. The plants gathered {{near the top of the}} pass were species of Compositae, grass, and Arenaria; the most curious was Saussurea gossypina, which forms great clubs of the softest white wool, six inches to a foot high, its flowers and leaves seeming uniformly clothed with the warmest fur that nature can devise. Generally speaking, the alpine plants of the Himalaya are quite unprovided with any special protection of this kind; it is the prevalence and conspicuous nature of the exceptions that mislead, and induce the careless observer to generalise hastily from solitary instances; for the prevailing alpine genera of the Himalaya, Arenarias, primroses, saxifrages, <b>fumitories,</b> Ranunculi, gentians, grasses, sedges, etc., have almost uniformly naked foliage.|$|R
6000|$|Caroline and Annie Cheviot were ladylike, nice-looking girls; {{but when}} they found no croquet mallets in the garden, they seemed at a loss what life had to offer at Stoneborough! Gertrude {{pronounced}} that 'she played at it sometimes at Maplewood, where she had nothing better to do,' and then retreated to her own devices. Ethel's heart sank both with dread of the afternoon, and with self-reproach at her spoilt child's discourtesy, whence she {{knew there would be}} no rousing her without an incapacitating discussion; and on she wandered in the garden with the guests, receiving instruction where the hoops might be planted, and hearing how nice it would be for her sister to have such an object, such a pleasant opportunity of meeting one's friends--an interest for every day. 'No wonder they think I want an object in life,' thought Ethel; 'how awfully tiresome I must be! Poor things, what can I say to make it pleasanter?--Do you know this Dielytra? I think it is the prettiest of modern flowers, but I wish we might call it Japan <b>fumitory,</b> or by some English name.' ...|$|E
60|$|Isolated {{patches of}} {{vegetation}} {{appeared on the}} top of the pass, where I gathered forty kinds of plants, most of them being of a tufted habit characteristic of an extreme climate; some (as species of Caryophylleae) forming hemi-spherical balls on the naked soil; others* [The other plants found on the pass were; of smooth hairless ones, Ranunculus, <b>Fumitory,</b> several species of Stellaria, Arenaria, Cruciferae, Parnassia, Morina, saxifrages, Sedum, primrose, Herminium, Polygonum, Campanula, Umbelliferae, grasses and Carices: of woolly or hairy once, Anemone, Artemisia, Myosotis, Draba, Potentilla, and several Compositae, etc.] growing in matted tufts level with the ground. The greater portion had no woolly covering; nor did I find any of the cottony species of Saussurea, which are so common on the wetter mountains to the southward. Some most delicate-flowered plants even defy the biting winds of these exposed regions; such are a prickly Meconopsis with slender flower-stalks and four large blue poppy-like petals, a Cyananthus with a membranous bell-shaped corolla, and a fritillary. Other curious plants were a little yellow saxifrage with long runners (very like the arctic S. flagellaris, of Spitzbergen and Melville Island), and the strong-scented spikenard (Nardostachys).|$|E
6000|$|... is a {{familiar}} verse from Cymbeline; any {{one can see the}} resemblance to the pale blue of that admired and loved blossom in the blue veins of any person with a delicate skin. Purples and purplish reds in masses are mostly seen in young persons of delicate skins and high colour in frosty weather in winter, when the eyes sparkle and the face glows with the happy sensations natural to the young and healthy during and after outdoor exercise. The skin purples and purple-reds here described are beautiful, and may be matched to a nicety in many flowers; the human purple may be seen (to name a very common wild flower) in purple loosestrife and the large marsh mallow, and in dozens and scores of other familiar purple flowers; and the purple-red hue in many richly coloured skins has its exact shade in common hounds' tongue, and in other dark and purple-red flowers. But we always find, I fancy, that the expression due to human association in a purple flower is greatest when this colour (as in the human face) is placed side by side or fades into some shade of red or pink. I think we may see this even in a small flower like the <b>fumitory,</b> in which one portion is deep purple {{and all the rest of}} the blossoms a delicate pink. Even when the red is very intense, as in the common field poppy, the pleasing expression of purple on red is very evident.|$|E
60|$|Shoals {{of small}} goggled-eyed fish are seen, that spring clear {{out of the}} water; and are preyed upon by terns and other birds; a few insects skim the surface; turtle and {{porpoises}} tumble along, all forming a very busy contrast to the lazy alligator, sunning his green and scaly back near the shore, with his ichthyosaurian snout raised high above the water. Birds are numerous, especially early and late in the day. Along the silent shore the hungry Pariah dog may be seen tearing his meal from some stranded corpse, whilst the adjutant-bird, with his head sunk on his body and one leg tucked up, patiently awaits his turn. At night the beautiful Brahminee geese alight, one by one, and seek total solitude; ever since having disturbed a god in his slumbers, these birds are fated to pass the night in single blessedness. The gulls and terns, again, roost in flocks, as do the wild geese and pelicans,--the latter, however, not till after making a hearty and very noisy supper. These birds congregate by the sides of pools, and beat the water with violence, so as to scare the fish, which thus become an easy prey; a fact which was, I believe, first indicated by Pallas, during his residence {{on the banks of}} the Caspian Sea. Shells are scarce, and consist of a few small bivalves; their comparative absence is probably due to the paucity of limestone in the mountains whence the many feeders flow. The sand is pure white and small-grained, with fragments of hornblende and mica, the latter varying in abundance as a feeder is near or far away. Pink sand* [I have seen the same garnet sand covering the bottom of the Himalayan torrents, where it is the produce of disintegrated gneiss, and whence it is transported to the Ganges.] of garnets is very common, and deposited in layers interstratified with the white quartz sand. Worm-marks, ripple-marks, and the footsteps of alligators, birds and beasts, abound in the wet sand. The vegetation of the banks consists of annuals which find no permanent resting-place. Along the sandy shores the ever-present plants are mostly English, as Dock, a Nasturtium, Ranunculus sceleratus, <b>Fumitory,</b> Juncus bufonius,, Common Vervain, Gnaphalium luteo-album, and very frequently Veronica Anagallise. On the alluvium grow the same, mixed with Tamarisk, Acacia Arabica, and a few other bushes.|$|E

50|$|Rising 150-200 feet (45-60 m) {{above the}} low terrace of Green Bay, the steep {{carbonate}} cliffs and outcrops support numerous rare land snails including the cherrystone drop snail (Hendersonia occulta), a state-threatened species. Aspen, sugar maple, red oak, hemlock, and white cedar {{grow out of}} the talus affording complete shade to the escarpment maintaining the cool and damp conditions, which support a lush growth of mosses. The unique site conditions also support such uncommon species as climbing <b>fumitory,</b> mountain maple, bulbet fern, common polypody, and fragile fern. Above the escarpment is a dry-mesic forest of red and white pine with red oak. The ground layer is dominated by round-leaved dogwood with northern bush honeysuckle, zig-zag goldenrod, big-leaved aster, and bracken fern. The site slowly grades into a richer, more mesic forest containing sugar maple, beech, and red oak with hemlock, and white pine. Also present is a wet-mesic forest of white cedar, big-tooth aspen, and black ash. Several white cedars reach impressive sizes here. Below the escarpment are seasonally flooded forests dominated by silver maple, and green ash with swamp white oak, American bladdernut, and great water-leaf. The site contains many rare plants including dwarf lake iris (Iris lacustris). Other noteworthy species within the SNA are variegated horsetail (Equisetum variegatum), Hooker's orchid (Platanthera hookeri), long-spurred violet (Viola rostrata), and large-flowered ground-cherry (Leucophysalis grandiflora). Rare animals include red-shouldered hawk (Buteo lineatus), Midwest Pleistocene vertigo (Vertigo hubrichti), Iowa Pleistocene vertigo (V. iowaensis) and Four-toed salamander (Hemidactylium scutatum). Significant portions of the Bayshore Blufflands are owned by the Door County Land Trust.|$|E
40|$|The current {{mechanisms}} of herbicide selectivity in poppy (Papaver somniferum L.) {{were examined in}} glasshouse and field experiments. Through measurements of contact angles of diquat solutions it was established that poppy, and the weeds <b>fumitory,</b> fat hen and field poppy are 'hard' to wet, whilst shepherds purse, wild radish, spear thistle and curled dock are relatively 'easy' to wet. It was revealed that diclofop-methyl has properties characteristic of a weak surfactant, compared with Agral®, a finding supported through measurements of dynamic surface tension. The structure of the surface wax on the adaxial surface of poppy, field poppy, <b>fumitory</b> and fat hen leaves are described as seen under the scanning electron microscope. Chemical analysis of these waxes are also given. It appears the wax of <b>fumitory</b> and fat hen are influenced by application of ethofumesate. Chemical analysis shows that ethofumesate can inhibit the deposition of primary alcohols, long chain aldehydes and alkanes on the developing leaves of <b>fumitory</b> and fat hen, making these plants more susceptible than poppy plants to future applications of diquat + diclofop-methyl. Field trials conducted on the east and north-west of Tasmania, highlighted the difficulties that exist in extrapolating results from glasshouse experiments to field conditions. Measurements of spray retention and efficacy, revealed that plant responses to applications of diquat treatments were influenced, in addition to ethofumesate, by environmental conditions. Plant responses at both sites demonstrated that the inert ingredients of the commercial formulation of diclofop-methyl, would, in admixture with diquat produce the same result compared with the current diquat/diclofop-methyl treatmen...|$|E
