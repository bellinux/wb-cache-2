5000|$|In {{the late}} 19th century, Lord Rayleigh {{demonstrated}} that an infinitely long cylindrical rod {{made up of}} dielectric material {{could serve as a}} waveguide. [...] Additional theoretical [...] and experimental [...] work done in Germany in early 20th century, offered further insight into the behavior of electromagnetic waves in <b>dielectic</b> rod waveguides. Since a dielectric resonator {{can be thought of as}} a truncated dielectric rod waveguide, this research was essential for scientific understanding of electromagnetic phenomena in dielectric resonators. In 1939 Robert D. Richtmyer published a study [...] in which he showed that dielectric structures can act just as metallic cavity resonators. He appropriately named these structures dielectric resonators. Richtmyer also demonstrated that, if exposed to free space, <b>dielectic</b> resonators must radiate because of the boundary conditions at the dielectric-to-air interface. These results were later used in development of DRA (Dielectric Resonator Antenna). Due to World War II, lack of advanced materials and adequate manufacturing techniques, dielectric resonators fell in relative obscurity for another two decades after Richtmyer's study was published. However, in the 1960s, as high-frequency electronics and modern communications industry started to take off, dielectric resonators gained in significance. They offered a size-reducing design alternative to bulky waveguide filters and lower-cost alternatives for electronic oscillator, frequency selective limiter [...] and slow-wave [...] circuits. In addition to cost and size, other advantages that dielectric resonators have over conventional metal cavity resonators are lower weight, material availability, and ease of manufacturing. There is a vast availability of different dielectric resonators on the market today with unloaded Q factor on the order of 10000s.|$|E
50|$|Charge in the {{universe}} is conserved. The electrophorus simply separates positive and negative charges. A positive or negative charge ends up on the metal plate (or other storage conductor), and the opposite charge is stored in another object after grounding (in the earth or the person touching the metal plate). This separation takes work since the lowest energy state implies uncharged objects. Work is done by raising the charged metal plate away from the oppositely charged resinous plate. This additional energy put into the system is converted to potential {{energy in the form}} of charge separation (opposite charges that were originally on the plate), so raising the metal plate actually increases its voltage relative to the <b>dielectic</b> plate.|$|E

The phase transition, which starts around TC-R = 385 K, spreads over a large temperature range and some amount of T-phase is still observed at room temperature (RT). The M-T phase mixture, induced below TC-R, is stable after field removal. According to a previous Raman scattering work, a fourfold symmetry of M-domains is proposed; the residual T-phase is stabilized by the coexistence of four symmetry-allowed M-domains arranged around[001].

40|$|ABSTRACT: A three-dimensional, {{electromechanical}} constitutive law {{has been}} formulated for electrostrictive ceramic materials. This fully coupled, phenomenological model relates the key state variables of stress, strain, electric field, polarization and temperature {{in a set of}} compact nonlinear equations. The direct and converse electrostrictive effects are modeled by assuming that the electri-cally induced strain depends on second-order polarization terms. In addition, a simple empirical relationship for the dielectric behavior is used to model the saturation of the induced polarization with increasing electric field. Unlike previous electrostrictive constitutive laws based on polynomial expansions, this consti-tutive law depends on a manageable number of material constants. As an example, material constants for the model were determined from induced strain and <b>dielectic</b> data for a relaxor-ferroelectric based on lead magnesium niobate, Pb(Mg 1 / 3 Nb 2) O 3 -PbTiOBa (PMN-PT-BT).

40|$|SiCxNyOz(H) ceramic {{coatings}} {{become increasingly}} attractive {{because of their}} superior properties as hardness, wear resistance, and chemical stability. The layers are deposited on steel substrates by plasma enhanced chemical vapour deposition (PE-CVD) using Hexamethyldilazane as precursor. The influence of RF power (3 W - 90 W) on structure and optical properties of the coatings has been investigated. On a first glance {{the composition of the}} deposited material seems to be strongly dependent on deposition conditions, e. g. on RF power of the plasma. But because of the appearance of intense interference fringes a straightforward interpretation of the reflectance spectra is virtuallyimpossible. To support the interpretation, the spectra have to be transformed into absorption spectra or into the <b>dielectic</b> function. A specially designed spectra fit procedure has been developed which is based on a Lorentzian shaped set of oscillators to model the dielectric function and a multilayer model which c overs a wide range of different optical configurations. The powerful GSA (generalised simulated annealing) algorithm has been adapted to fit a set (three or more) of measured reflectance spectra with differential angle of incidence and the two polarisations to the established optical model. The GSA procedure has been applied to both fitting the originally measured reflectance spectra and for fitting their derivatives. The latter attempt has been found more convenient in regions of low absorptivity (n > 1800 cm- 1). The imaginary part of the resulting <b>dielectic</b> function indicates the existence of different functional groups within the network structure of the layer: Si-H (2150 cm- 1, 2020 cm- 1), C-H (2890 cm- 1), N-H (3350 cm- 1), SiC (820 cm- 1), Si-N (870 cm- 1, 460 cm- 1), Si-NH-Si (1550 cm- 1) and Si-O (1100 cm- 1). Surprisingly, the network structure does not significantly depend on the RF power applied during deposition. Only small changes of the oscillator strength has been detected. It is concluded that the extremely strong influence of the deposition conditions on the reflectance spectra is mainly an optical effect. It is not the change of chemical structure which caused the observed effect but the dependence of layer thickness on RF power and, to a smaller degree, the change of the (high frequency) refractive index...|$|E

When the ratio A/T sufficiently large the disk will always be in {{one or the other of}} these regimes, T lambda or kA 1.

Polishing of tungsten (W) and interlayer dielectric (SiO₂) films is carried out using alumina (Al₂O₃) based slurries which typically contain acids, complexing and oxidizing agents.

40|$|The main {{aim of the}} investigations, {{described}} in this thesis is to provide data {{which can be used}} to test theories of <b>dielectic</b> phenomena in dilute colloid systems. The possibility of preparing homodisperse polystyrene latices with surfaces uncontaminated by emulsifiers, means that dielectric methods can be applied to these colloid dispersions. The equipment used and the latices which where prepared are {{described in}} chapters two and three respectively. The experimental results for latex A 1 , with KCl as the added electrolyte, are particularly relevant. These results, which are characteristic of the dielectric behaviour of dilute polystyrene latices, are used in chapter five for calculations with different theories. Based on the dependence of the static dielectric increment Δε st on c b, the concentration of added electrolyte, it appears that until now no theory exists, by which the experimental results obtained are explained conclusively. The best agreement between theory and experiment is obtained both with the theory of Dukhin and Shilov and with that of Schurr. Using the calculated relaxation times, it is impossible to discriminate between these two theories, because in both cases a relaxation time is calculated which is of the right order of magnitude compared with the experimental value. Figure (5 - 2) demonstrates that Schurr's theory is the best in accordance with the experimental results. However, in Schurr's theory the diffusion fluxes of the ions in the diffuse part of the double layer are not taken Into account. In view of their theoretical starting points the theory of Dukhin and Shilov must be considered as the best one. The larger discrepancy between the theory of Dukhin and Shilov and the experimental results for Ac st as a function of c h may be caused by an overestimation of the influence of radial fluxes in their theory. In conclusion, based on the established discrepancies between theory and experiment It is thought to be pertinent to perform further dielectric measurements on other colloid model systems such as chromium hydroxide sols. Probably, a part of these discrepancies is due to irregularities in the polystyrene latices used. on the other hand, it is necessary to develop the theory further. In this case special attention must be paid to the role played by the diffusion coefficients and diffusion fluxes around the colloid particles. ...|$|E

In chapter 3 we present the studies of the #alpha# relaxation of poly(vinyl acetate), PVAac, and of the <b>dielectic</b> relaxation of poly(vinyl acetate) /p-nitroaniline mixtures. It is shown that the p-nitroaline, pNA, acts like a normal plasticizer and its amino group interacts with the acetate groups of PVac via hydrogen bond interactions. In chapter 4 we study the effect of the same solute in the following dielectric relaxation processes: the poly(methyl methacrylate), PMMA, the the #beta# and #alpha# #beta# relaxations of the poly(ethyl methacrylate), PEMA, and the #alpha# #beta# relaxation of the poly(n-butyl methacrylate), PnBMA. We also present the study of the dielectric relaxation of the pure polymers. In PNMMA and PEMA the solute acts in a similar manner to a temperature increase. Consequently, the relaxation deviates to an #alpha# #beta# region accompained by a enhancement of the #alpha# relaxation and an inhibition of the #beta# process. In PnBMA/pNA mixturesd the #alpha# characteristics of the relaxation process of the matrix are enhanced. We conclude from the analysis of the different dielectric relaxations spectra, that the solute interacts with the PMMA via hydrogen bonding; this effect is less pronounced in PEMA and it is absent in PnBMA. In chapter 5 we present a preliminary suty of miscibility of poly(vinyl acetate) /poly(ethyl methacrylate) blends. We conclude that the 50 e 75 % (Weight percent in PVac) blends are incompatible and that the 25 % blend between 50 and 100 degrees C is compatible. Another purpose of this work was to apply the dielectric techniques to structural studies. In chapter 6 we accomplish this studying the conformational equilibrium of the trans- 1, 2 -dibromocyclohexane in n-alkanes solvents: n-C_ 5, nC_ 6,n-C_ 8, nC_ 10 and n_C_ 1 _ 2. Long n-dibromocyclohexane in n-alkanes solvents are characterized by a short range molecular order which stabilize the extended conformations. The aim of this work was therefore to check if the anisotropy of the molecular shape of the long n-alkanes could stabilize the diequatorial conformer of the trans- 1, 2 -dibromocyclohexane (wich have a more elongate shape), knowing that the conformers have different dipole moments. The dipole moments mesured in each solvent have been compared with the dipole moment of the trans- 1, 2 -dibromocyclohexane in cyclohexane, a globular solvent, and we observed that the dipole moment in the n-alkane solvents is higher than in the xcyclic solvent. There is also a slight of the dipole moment with the number of carbon atoms. This facts be interpreted as a stabilization effect of the fdiequatorial conformer with the increase of the degree of order of the solventAvailable from Fundacao para a Ciencia e a Tecnologia, Servico de Informacao e Documentacao, Av.
