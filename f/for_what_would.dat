5|$|A strong {{proponent of}} the day fighter force and the defence of Germany, Galland used his {{position}} to improve {{the position of the}} Jagdwaffe. The need was now pressing, as Germany had declared war on the United States on 11 December 1941, and Galland was keen to build up a force that could withstand the resurgence of the Western Allied Air Forces in preparation <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become known as the Defence of the Reich campaign. Galland was outspoken, something that was not often tolerated by Göring. Yet, by earning and cultivating the support of other powerful personalities in the Luftwaffe, like Erhard Milch and Günther Korten, and personalities in the industrial sector such as Albert Speer and even Adolf Hitler, Galland was able to survive in his position for three years.|$|E
5|$|An east–west freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing traffic to access downtown Lansing in the 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become the Interstate Highway System. As originally {{proposed by the}} Michigan State Highway Department in 1958, the freeway was to be called I-296. The department was waiting on approval of a final numbering scheme the next year, before the first Interstates were signed {{in the state in}} 1959. By the time construction started on the Lansing freeway, it was numbered I-496.|$|E

Bochy said he wanted to give Bumgarner a break and also allow Barry Zito a final home start.

5|$|Planning <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become SR 125 {{north of}} I-8 began in 1954. Route 282 {{was defined as}} a route from Brown Field through La Mesa {{extending}} to Route 277 in 1959, and in 1961 the latter terminus was changed to Route 278. The California Highway Commission selected a route for the highway in mid-1963. In the 1964 state highway renumbering, SR 125 was designated as the highway from SR 75 near Brown Field to SR 56. Route198 was renumbered as State Route67; the portion south of I-8 was renumbered as SR 125.|$|E

5|$|Their {{ideas were}} well {{received}} by TSR, whose marketing department {{felt they had}} enough dungeons, but not enough dragons. Hickman suggested a series of twelve modules, each featuring a different dragon. TSR employee Harold Johnson suggested that Hickman should try to get additional support from other TSR staff members and, {{after a period of}} months, Hickman had the support of Jeff Grubb, Larry Elmore, Roger Moore, Doug Niles, Michael Williams, and others with whom they discussed ideas for the project. Meanwhile, Weis was editing and writing various Endless Quest books for TSR. The Dragonlance group decided that novels should accompany the game modules; TSR reluctantly agreed and hired a writer. Hickman became the design coordinator for Project Overlord, the cover name <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> later be known as the Dragonlance saga.|$|E
5|$|A north–south freeway was {{originally}} planned as an Interstate Highway allowing through traffic {{to bypass the}} city of Detroit. This plan {{was included in the}} 1955 General Location of National System of Interstate Highways (Yellow Book), an early proposal <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become the Interstate Highway System. The Yellow Book contained an inset of the proposed freeways in and around the Detroit area including a north–south freeway east of the current I-275 corridor. The 1958 numbering plan for Michigan submitted by the State Highway Department had this route initially marked as I-73. William Swanson in the MDOT Highway Planning Unit later stated that the department also planned to reverse the numbering of I-75 and I-275 between Newport and Davisburg; I-75 would have bypassed downtown Detroit just as it bypassed downtown Flint and downtown Saginaw to the north, and the auxiliary number (I-275) would have been used on the freeway through downtown Detroit.|$|E
5|$|Burge {{moved to}} Championship club Doncaster Rovers on a {{short-term}} deal on transfer deadline day, 31 January 2011.

On 17 March 2011, Burge joined League Two team Oxford United on loan {{for the rest of}} the season, after impressing in a reserve game against Colchester United which Oxford won 2–0. He went straight into the starting line-up for the match against Crewe Alexandra two days later, and provided the assist for James Constable's winning goal. His first performance at Oxford received praise in the local media. A week later, Steve MacLean opened the scoring against Burton Albion, but Burge reportedly claimed the goal after the ball took a deflection off his heel on its way into the net <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have been his first Football League goal. In mid-April 2011 he was recalled by Doncaster, and a few weeks later they offered him a new deal.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{the legal}} action, {{pre-production}} towards Bond 17 still progressed, with some early details unveiled at the Cannes Film Festival {{which took place}} in May 1990. However, delays occurred because of the ongoing legal action with MGM/UA and, in an August 1993 interview, Dalton revealed that Michael France was involved in writing a script for the next Bond film, with Anthony Hopkins as a potential villain, adding that Hopkins had been in discussions with Eon for a number of weeks. Dalton also stated that the earliest production could begin would be in January or February 1994. Dalton's six-year contract expired in 1993, and after reading France's script <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become GoldenEye, he announced on 12 April 1994 {{that he would not be}} returning to play Bond; he was replaced by Pierce Brosnan. After Michael France delivered the original screenplay, Jeffrey Caine was brought in to rework much of the material. Kevin Wade was also brought into the process before Bruce Feirstein gave the final polish to the script.|$|E

Indira {{was sworn in as}} Prime Minister by Reddy <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> become her last term in office in January 1980.

5|$|Olajuwon led the Rockets to a {{championship}} in the 1994 NBA Finals in a seven-game {{series against the}} New York Knicks, the team of one of Olajuwon's perennial rivals since his collegiate days, Patrick Ewing. After being down 2–1, the Knicks took a 3–2 lead into Game 6. The Rockets were defending an 86–84 lead when in the last second, Knicks guard John Starks (who had already scored 27 points) went up <b>for</b> <b>what</b> <b>would</b> have been a Finals-winning three. Olajuwon pulled off a clutch play by blocking the shot as time expired. In Game 7, Olajuwon posted a game–high 25 points and 10 rebounds, which helped defeat the Knicks, bringing the first professional sports championship to Houston since the Houston Oilers won the American Football League championship in 1961. Olajuwon dominated Ewing in their head–to–head match-up, outscoring him in every game of the series and averaging 26.9 points per game on 50% shooting, compared to Ewing's 18.9 and 36.3%.
