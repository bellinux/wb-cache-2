5|$|Etty was {{a regular}} attender at the Royal Academy's life class {{throughout}} his career. Nyssia stands in a pose which Etty had sketched many times, that {{of a woman with}} her knee on a raised plinth and one arm raised holding a <b>hanging</b> <b>rope.</b> (Throughout his career Etty had difficulty painting arms, and generally showed his subjects holding their arms away from their body to expose as much of their torso as possible.) It is possible that Etty intentionally chose the obscure subject of the painting as a pretext to paint a woman in this pose. As with many Etty works the female figure has a far better finish {{than the rest of the}} canvas, and it is likely Etty painted Nyssia directly from a life model, completing the rest of the composition later in a studio.|$|E
25|$|With tiny {{pieces of}} the <b>hanging</b> <b>rope</b> already being sold as souvenirs to a fascinated public, rumors {{immediately}} began to swirl that jail guards planned to dig up Guiteau's corpse to meet demands of this burgeoning new market. Fearing scandal, {{the decision was made}} to disinter the corpse. The body was sent to the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland, which preserved Guiteau's brain as well as his enlarged spleen discovered at autopsy and bleached the skeleton. These were placed in storage by the museum. Parts of Guiteau's brain remain on display in a jar at the Mütter Museum in Philadelphia.|$|E
2500|$|The {{cause of}} death in hanging depends on the {{conditions}} related to the event. When the body is released from a relatively high position, the major {{cause of death}} is severe trauma to the upper cervical spine. The injuries produced are highly variable. One study showed that only a small minority of a series of judicial hangings produced fractures to the cervical spine (6 out of 34 cases studied), with half of these fractures (3 out of 34) being the classic [...] "hangman's fracture" [...] (bilateral fractures of the pars interarticularis of the C2 vertebra). The location of the knot of the <b>hanging</b> <b>rope</b> is a major factor in determining the mechanics of cervical spine injury, with a submental knot (hangman's knot under the chin) being the only location capable of producing the sudden, straightforward hyperextension injury that causes the classic [...] "hangman's fracture".|$|E
50|$|The third {{question}} and second-to-last obstacle awaited the partner, {{with the question}} choice represented by <b>hanging</b> <b>ropes</b> from the regular series' plexiglass wall.

Once eight bags are retrieved, the solvers would then open the bags and attempt to solve the monkey puzzle inside. First tribe to form their monkey puzzle would win immunity.|$|R

50|$|Rope {{culture is}} very similar in {{principle}} to ear hanging with the only difference being the method of attachment.
