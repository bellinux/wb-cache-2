500|$|The {{two parties}} first found {{themselves}} at odds in July 2001, after LeMond expressed public {{concern over the}} relationship between Italian doping doctor Michele Ferrari and Trek's star athlete, Lance Armstrong. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> was working with Michele Ferrari, I was devastated," [...] LeMond {{was quoted as saying}} of Armstrong. [...] "If Lance is clean, it is the greatest comeback in the history of sports. If he isn't, it would be the greatest fraud." ...|$|E
500|$|Pearson's career paralleled Richard Petty's, {{the driver}} {{who won the}} most races in NASCAR history. They {{accounted}} for 63 first/second-place finishes (with the edge going to Pearson). Petty said, [...] "Pearson could beat you on a short track, he could beat you on a superspeedway, he could beat you on a road course, he could beat you on a dirt track. It didn't hurt as bad to lose to Pearson as it did {{to some of the}} others, because I knew how good he was." [...] Pearson said of Petty: [...] "I always felt that if I beat him I beat the best, and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> said the same thing about me." ...|$|E
500|$|I {{definitely}} don't go {{the straight}} and narrow path, and you know, I definitely kinda like to experiment and collaborate. And so, I think it's taken me and Max this long to work together because of that, because what he does is genius and he is a classic hitmaker. But when I was coming out it was {{at a time when we}} had the huge pop explosion, and he was all over radio and I just wanted to work with others like Linda Perry and do that route and do [...] "Beautiful" [...] and songs like that. We built a level of respect for each other. So at this point, coming together, especially embracing my true pop-starness, at this point in my career having come full circle, I was able to really truly embrace it, and embrace him. He gave me the freedom to really sing on these songs, and have a little more creative freedom because <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> is a stickler for melody and a melody king and I was scared, I was like 'Oh my God! I won't be able to collaborate here.' But he couldn't have been more great, and this is a really fun song, super up-tempo. It's probably the most dancey-ish song on my record, but it's called 'Let There Be Love' but it's free and representative of what this album is about.|$|E
6000|$|... "She couldn't 'ave {{a better}} husband," [...] ses Charlie, {{whispering}} again; [...] "but where is Mrs. Jennings's young man? <b>I</b> <b>'eard</b> <b>he</b> {{was to be}} here." ...|$|R

500|$|Jay-Z {{opened his}} set at Glastonbury 2008 {{with a cover}} of Oasis' song [...] "Wonderwall". When Gallagher {{was asked about the}} {{incident}} he replied, [...] "The way it's played itself out is that I said Jay-Z had no right to play Glastonbury, which is a crock of horseshit. I got off a plane and someone asked me about the fact that Glastonbury hadn't sold {{out for the first time}} in years, and if it was because of Jay-Z. From there it grew into this crap that I was standing on an orange crate at Speakers' Corner saying, 'Gather round, brothers and sisters. Have you heard what's happening at Glastonbury this year?' I have a certain turn of phrase. So if I say, [...] "Chicken sandwiches in McDonald's are just plain fucking wrong," [...] it doesn't mean I'm attacking all chickens or all sandwiches. I've hung out with Jay-Z in Tokyo. I've seen his show. It's not my bag, but it's all right. We have a mutual friend in Chris Martin. So I am a guy who doesn't like hip-hop—shock, horror. I don't dislike rappers or hip-hop or people who like it. I went to the Def Jam tour in Manchester in the '80s when rap was inspirational. Public Enemy were awesome. But it's all about status and bling now, and it doesn't say anything to me." [...] When Jay-Z was asked about Gallagher's comments he said [...] "I haven't spoken to him , <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> was reaching out. I don't bear any grudge, it's all good. I just believe in good music and bad music, I've always said that. You look at any interview from the beginning of time, I've always stated that I don't believe in the lines and classifications that people put music in so they can easily define it". When asked who he would be interested in collaborating with in the future, the rapper said, [...] "Anyone. Oasis as well – it doesn't matter to me." ...|$|E
2500|$|As McMahon later stated, [...] "I {{realised}} what I {{wanted to}} do was work with a good synth player [...] – a very good synth player. So I mucked around with a few guys in Sydney but their range was too narrow then I remembered hearing Peter Carolan's playing ten years ago. He was playing a dulcimer in the bush and when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> was now playing synth I knew straight away this was the melody man to compose that key part of Gondwanland." [...] They worked on their first composition, [...] "Pulse," [...] inspired by the sound of a heartbeat.|$|E
2500|$|Relations between Tanzania and Rwanda {{deteriorated}} in 2013 when Tanzanian President Jakaya Kikwete {{said that}} if the Democratic Republic of the Congo (DRC) could negotiate with some of its enemies, Rwanda {{should be able to do}} the same. Rwandan President Paul Kagame then expressed [...] "contempt" [...] for Kikwete's statement. The tension was renewed in May 2014 when, in a speech to the Tanzanian National Assembly, Foreign Affairs Minister Bernard Membe renewed his claim that Rwandans were causing instability in the DRC. Rwandan Foreign Affairs Minister Louise Mushikiwabo responded, [...] "As for Tanzania's foreign minister whose anti-Rwanda rant in parliament <b>I</b> <b>heard,</b> <b>he</b> would benefit from a lesson in the history of the region." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "But why? Perhaps {{you know}} some good reason to the contrary; for <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> admired you very much when he met you last year." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{should have}} thought he had {{two or three of}} them," [...] said Penelope, [...] "by the {{stamping}} round <b>I</b> <b>heard.</b> Isn't <b>he</b> coming to breakfast?" ...|$|R
60|$|The {{messenger}} leapt away, but, as <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> afterwards, <b>he</b> {{never found}} Umbelazi, since {{the poor man}} was killed within five hundred yards of where we stood.|$|R
60|$|LADY HUNSTANTON. I fancy, Caroline, that Diplomacy is what Lord Illingworth {{is aiming}} at. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>he</b> was offered Vienna. But {{that may not}} be true.|$|R
6000|$|... "Drinking tinto!" [...] he remarked. [...] "Well, I guess that's prudent. But how's the Buccaneer? He's {{been looking}} shaky and <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> was ill." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Rawdon Lilly! Why, {{is he in}} Venice? Oh, I've heard SUCH a {{lot about}} him. I should like so much to meet him. But <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> was in Germany--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "It was Larry Grant fixed that, and 'tisn't {{every day}} {{you can find a}} man like him. It 'most made me sick when <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> had gone over to the rabble." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I <b>heard</b> this," [...] <b>I</b> answered, [...] "and I {{have never}} {{mentioned}} it to a soul till to-day. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>he</b> was starting for Solomon's Mines." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'And {{he has to}} pawn {{things to}} live!' Her voice trembled. 'He was at the mont-de-piete today. And {{yesterday}} too. <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> him. <b>He</b> was arguing with M. Gandinot--haggling--' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then that's all right," [...] {{she said}} with a sigh of relief. [...] "You see, <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>he</b> was very ill, which is why I have come back." ...|$|R
60|$|I {{went away}} without seeing the German doctor, but as <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> spoke no English, and as I {{did not know}} German, an {{interview}} with him would have been of no avail.|$|E
60|$|I {{fell on the}} stairs, but I {{saw that}} flaming-faced devil kill four of Durade's men. He got Allie Lee out. Later <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> had been killed and that Durade had caught the girl.|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, well," [...] {{said the}} other, [...] "that just beats me! When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> had his niece with him I {{thought she was}} a plain girl, with short frocks and her hair plaited down her back." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, love, there {{shall be}} an end of it; {{at least for the}} present. When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> that <b>he</b> had gone {{suddenly}} away I thought that something had happened." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "About {{the desert}} island," [...] {{continued}} the old lady, calmly. [...] "The story that <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> was that <b>he</b> went {{off like a}} cur and left his young wife {{to do the best}} she could for herself. <b>I</b> suppose <b>he's</b> <b>heard</b> since that she has come in for a bit of money." ...|$|R
6000|$|RENCH. Didn't I say so? When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> how <b>he</b> {{was when}} he got back, I said to Fred Hillman here,--if anybody can cure him, it's Dr. Jonathan, right here in Foxon Falls! ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Reginald Clavering," [...] she said. [...] "He's {{from the}} prairie where Miss Torrance's father lives, and is staying {{a day or}} two with us. When <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> knew Hetty I ventured to bring him over." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I know it--and I imagine Captain Putnam is {{preparing}} {{to get rid of}} him, for <b>I</b> <b>heard</b> <b>he</b> was corresponding with a teacher in Buffalo--one who has been head master in a military academy out in that vicinity." ...|$|E
