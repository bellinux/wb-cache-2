The glazing gave good views of the sky, and, when flying at low, the sea. The weather officer's task was to observe and record both the visible conditions outside the airplane and the indications on the instruments. The psychrometer and aerograph indicated the relative humidity. The free air thermometer and aerograph gave the air temperature. The radio altimeter gave the altitude, and the pressure altimeter and aerograph gave the air pressure. By using both altimeters, the weather officer determined and recorded the air pressure at standard altitudes, such as 5,000 and 10,000 feet. Wind speed and direction were determined from the aircraft's drift off course. By watching for sharp changes in temperature and humidity on the aerograph chart, the weather officer noted the strength and locations of cold fronts. By having the airplane fly along a constant pressure altitude, the weather officer could map an <b>isobaric</b> <b>surface.</b>|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} a theoretical {{study of the}} disturbed <b>isobaric</b> <b>surface</b> shape in the geostrophic state of the atmosphere. It has been shown that, depending on the overheat sign at the equator, the <b>isobaric</b> <b>surface</b> has {{the shape of an}} oblate or prolate geoid. If the geostrophic wind velocity is nonzero at the poles, the local pressure extrema (minima for oblate geoid and maxima for prolate geoid) appear at the poles in the geostrophic state. This result correlates with the well-known polar vortex phenomenon and possibly can refine our understanding and interpretation of the phenomenon. In other words, the existence of polar minima and maxima of the pressure field can be the peculiarity of the geostrophic state of the atmosphere. It has been found that air must be colder than the surrounding atmosphere for initiation of the zonal eastward transport. For warm air mass, only easterly winds will be observed...|$|E

50|$|In meteorology, a {{barotropic}} atmosphere {{is one that}} for which {{the density of the}} air depends only on pressure, as a result <b>isobaric</b> <b>surfaces</b> (constant-pressure surfaces) are also constant-density <b>surfaces.</b> Such <b>isobaric</b> <b>surfaces</b> will also be isothermal surfaces, hence (from the thermal wind equation) the geostrophic wind will not vary with depth.
