40|$|Oil jet {{lubrication}} on the disengaging {{side of a}} {{gear mesh}} was analyzed. Results of the analysis were computerized and {{used to determine the}} oil jet impingement depth for several gear ratios and oil jet to pitch line velocity ratios. A gear test rig using high speed photography was used to experimentally determine the oil jet impingement depth on the disengaging side of mesh. Impingement depth reached a maximum at gear ratio near 1. 5 where chopping by the leading gear tooth limited impingement depth. The pinion impingement depth is zero above a gear ratio of 1. 172 for a jet velocity to pitch time velocity ration of 1. 0 and is similar for other velocity ratios. The impingement depth for gear and pinion are equal and approximately one half the maximum at a <b>gear</b> <b>ration</b> of 7. 0...|$|E
40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed for selection of gear number and transmission gear ratios in mechanical part of a wheel-type tractor with electro-mechanical transmission containing a propulsion asynchronous electric motor with variablefrequency control. The paper proposes to determine a transmission gear ratio {{on the basis of}} the following: provision of wheel torque dependence on tractor speed which is the best one for a traction process and during transfer from one gear to the other; provision of nominal operational mode of the electric motor for all tractor operations where it is working for a long period of time; provision of minimum possible number of gears; complete realization of internal combustion engine power on the tractor wheels at limit operational mode of the electric motor. As a characteristic of the asynchronous electric motor with variable-frequency control contains various portions which can be used either completely or partially due to operating conditions, the gear number is determined in the process of transmission <b>gear</b> <b>ration</b> finding but not prior to this. A wheel torque of the tractor with electro-mechanical transmission can be limited according to the following factors: grip of wheel with supporting surface; maximum power of an internal combustion engine which can be transferred to the wheels and a torque which is developed by a propulsion electric motor. It is not proposed to exceed nominal operational mode of the propulsion electric motor for all the operations of the tractor if it is working for a long period of time because in the case of significant excess of the nominal operational mode of the asynchronous electric motor its rather long operation leads to low efficiency and high losses in power, large heat liberation and consequently requires to develop more complicated system for electric motor cooling. An excess of nominal electric motor torque can be justified for short-term operational modes because in this case there is no need to select more powerful electric motor and create an additional gear in the gear-box. </p...|$|E

6000|$|I {{had thought}} of encamping near the [...] "Praying-place of Moses," [...] a fine breezy site which storms would have made untenable. As at Sharmá, camels must turn {{off to the right}} over the banks when {{approaching}} the mouth of the Wady Madyan, whose bed is made impassable by rocks and palm-thicket. We then proposed to pitch the tents upon the valley sands within the [...] "Gate," [...] but this was overruled by the Sayyid, who told grisly tales of fever and ague. Finally, we returned to our former ground, near the old conglomerates and the mass of new shells, which ledge the shore of the little harbour. Approaching it, we were delighted to see the gunboat Mukhbir steaming up, despite the contrary wind, from Sharm Yáhárr; she was towing the Sambúk, which brought from 'Aynúnah Bay our heavy <b>gear,</b> <b>rations,</b> and tools. This was a stroke of good luck: already we were on half rations, and provant for men and mules threatened to run short.|$|R
50|$|Having {{prepared}} a possible escape plan for some time, Terry armed {{himself with a}} semi-automatic pistol, borrowed a motorbike from the garage of an expatriate and fled Stanley. His first stop was Long Island Farm, home of Neil and Glenda Watson, where a party {{was in full swing}} celebrating the Queen's birthday. This was nearly his undoing as the party did not hear the approach of a Puma helicopter till too late and the house was already surrounded by Argentine soldiers. Fortunately the search of the house was half-hearted and he escaped detection with the simple expedient of locking himself in the toilet. He left for Green Patch to find the locals expecting him, there he acquired cold weather <b>gear</b> and <b>rations</b> left there by a party of Royal Navy sailors from HMS Endurance. He then spent ten miserable days camping in a remote part of the islands known as Geordie's Valley, where he had fished before the occupation. Eventually the cold sapped his morale and he risked a fire for the chance of a hot meal, unfortunately just as it was ready he accidentally knocked it over. It was the lowest point of his escape and demoralised he sought help from Trudi Morrison at Brookfield Farm. A warm meal and a bath improved his mood {{and with the help of}} other islanders he recovered weapons hidden by Royal Marines who escaped during the invasion.|$|R
25|$|Although SIGINT {{had earlier}} alerted Jackson to the {{possible}} {{presence of a}} strong Viet Cong force {{in the vicinity of}} Nui Dat 2, patrols of the area revealed nothing and as a consequence B Company did not expect to meet significant opposition. Stepping off early on 17 August they believed they would not be out long and were only lightly equipped in patrol order, lacking sleeping <b>gear</b> and <b>rations.</b> With just 80 men—including many due to commence leave in Vung Tau the following day—they were significantly under-strength. Crossing the Suoi Da Bang creek, the firing point of the mortars was soon located as were signs of the Viet Cong withdrawal as they pushed further east. Meanwhile, A Company, 6 RAR under Captain Charles Mollison continued its patrol north of Nui Dat 2, and was involved in three minor clashes, killing one Viet Cong and wounding two. B Company was subsequently tasked to remain in the area to search to the north and east the following day and was met by porters that afternoon to supply them with rations. 9 Platoon, C Company returned to Nui Dat with nothing to report, leaving A and B Company to harbour in their night locations. Speculation {{about the size of the}} Viet Cong in the area increased. Captain Bryan Wickens, the 6 RAR Intelligence Officer, assessed that the presence of medium mortars, RCLs and artillery likely indicated a significant force. Due to growing uncertainty about Viet Cong intentions, Jackson agreed the patrol scheduled for 18 August should be increased from platoon to company size. D Company, 6 RAR under command of Major Harry Smith had previously been detailed for a three-day patrol south-east of Nui Dat and was instead ordered to relieve B Company the next day to continue the search. Despite this, neither Townsend nor Smith were warned of the possible presence of the 275th Regiment.|$|R
500|$|On December1, {{the eye of}} Typhoon Ophelia passed {{directly}} over the small atoll of Ulithi, which has a total land area of 4.6km2 (1.8mi2). [...] The atoll comprises multiple islands, the largest islet being no more than 1.6km (1mi) long and even shorter width-wise. It was regarded as the worst storm to hit the atoll since 1907 when similarly violent typhoon devastated the area. At {{the time of the}} storm, an estimated 450people lived on the island and 16members of the United States Coast Guard were stationed there. Residents and coast guard members were first alerted of the storm on November21 when it was near Enewetak Atoll; however no action was taken. It was not until November28 when Ophelia began intensifying that precautions were taken. By this time, winds had already begun increasing and the commanding officer ordered that all equipment, personal <b>gear,</b> and emergency <b>rations</b> were to be taken into a concrete shelter. Natives were not entirely prepared for the typhoon, with two villages receiving no word of its approach. Three villages that were informed were not given the necessary urgency of the typhoon and did not expect the severity of damage the occurred. A Trust Territory vessel, the MV Errol, was anchored in the lagoon but left without warning nearby natives on November29.|$|R
