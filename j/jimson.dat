5|$|Several weeks later, <b>Jimson</b> {{is fired}} {{from his job}} for {{slapping}} his manager and is deported back to India. The following day, Mahesh and Baby challenge him to a hand-to-hand combat. After {{a few minutes of}} fighting, Mahesh pins down <b>Jimson</b> and Baby declares him the winner. Mahesh visits <b>Jimson</b> in a hospital on the next day and introduces himself to his mother in front of Jimsy. He admits his love for Jimsy and asks <b>Jimson</b> for his sister's hand in marriage, as <b>Jimson</b> and his mother look at each other in disbelief. In the credits, Mahesh is seen joining with Jimsy.|$|E
5|$|Baby becomes {{involved}} in a trivial argument with a loafer in {{the centre of the}} village. The dispute escalates, but passersby calm them down. However, Crispin appears and attacks the man who had argued with Baby. The man, joined by <b>Jimson</b> Augustine, jumps on Crispin in retaliation. Noticing the commotion, Mahesh tries to calm everyone down but <b>Jimson,</b> furious at Mahesh's authoritative stance, beats him up. Vincent breaks up the fight. Embarrassed, Mahesh vows to get back at <b>Jimson</b> and pledges that he will wear slippers only after he has avenged his humiliation.|$|E

It is on the World Health Organization's List of Essential Medicines, the most effective and safe medicines needed in a health system. It is available as a generic medication and is not very expensive. A one-milligram vial costs between US$0.06 and US$0.44, wholesale, in the developing world.|$|E
25|$|The {{lives of}} the Gabrielinos were governed {{by a set of}} {{religious}} and cultural practices that included belief in creative supernatural forces. They worshipped a creator god, Chinigchinix, and a female virgin god, Chukit. Their Great Morning Ceremony was based on a belief in the afterlife. In a purification ritual similar to the Eucharist, they drank tolguache, a hallucinogenic made from <b>jimson</b> weed and salt water. Their language was called Kizh or Kij, and they practiced cremation.|$|E

He first {{discussed}} the film with Fahadh Faasil during the filming of Iyobinte Pusthakam in 2014, in which the director played a minor role. Faasil, enthusiastic about the project, agreed to appear in the film after fulfilling his other commitments. Pothan described Mahesh as a simpleton with a multi-layered character and wanted an actor who would provide much finesse and subtlety to the portrayal. He added that Faasil was chosen for the [...] "natural and spontaneous" [...] actor in him. Pothan and Pushkaran cast Soubin Shahir as Crispin early in the screenwriting process. The director summoned Sujith Shanker, who debuted in Njan Steve Lopez (2015), for a script-briefing section as a possible <b>Jimson.</b> Although Shanker liked the story, he was uncertain whether he would fit in the role; however, Pothan had confidence in him.|$|E

2500|$|Historically, and {{possibly}} {{related to the}} [...] "Reefer Madness" [...] legend, some people (particularly Americans) had confused cannabis with <b>Jimson</b> weed (Datura stramonium). <b>Jimson</b> weed, which grows wild in the United States and several other countries, is a potent deliriant which can cause true hallucinations and delusions that are believed by the user to be real, {{as opposed to the}} pseudohallucinations and perceptual distortions typically caused by cannabis. Confusion could have resulted from the fact that Daturas common name contains the word [...] "weed," [...] which is also a slang term for cannabis, and the fact that both plants (as well as others) have been given the moniker [...] "locoweed" [...] {{in the first half of}} the 20th century. [...] Aside from these superficial similarities, the two plants are not related and have very little to do with one another, and thus should not be confused. [...] <b>Jimson</b> weed is highly toxic and can cause delirium, confusion, hallucinations, blurred vision, photophobia, dry mouth, urinary retention, hyperthermia, incoordination, hypertension, and rapid heartbeat among other effects. [...] An overdose (or suspected overdose) on this substance is a medical emergency, as it can cause seizures, coma, or death by cardiac arrest.|$|E
2500|$|The term nagual {{has been}} used by anthropologists to mean a shaman or sorcerer who claims to be able to change into an animal form, or to metaphorically [...] "shift" [...] into another form through magic rituals, shamanism and {{experiences}} with psychoactive drugs (e.g., peyote and <b>jimson</b> weed – Datura innoxia).|$|E

She painted her first large-scale flower painting, Petunia, No. 2, in 1924 that was first exhibited in 1925. Making magnified depictions of objects imbued a sense of awe and emotional intensity. On November 20, 2014, O'Keeffe's <b>Jimson</b> Weed (1932) sold for $44,405,000, {{more than three times}} the previous world auction record for any female artist.|$|E
2500|$|O'Keeffe and Stieglitz lived {{together}} in New York until 1929, when O'Keeffe began spending {{part of the}} year in the Southwest, which served as inspiration for her paintings of New Mexico landscapes and images of animal skulls, such as [...] and Ram's Head White Hollyhock and Little Hills. After Stieglitz’s death, she lived permanently in New Mexico at Georgia O'Keeffe Home and Studio in Abiquiú, until the last years of her life when she lived in Santa Fe. In 2014, O'Keeffe's 1932 painting <b>Jimson</b> Weed sold for $44,405,000, more than three times the previous world auction record for any woman artist.

2500|$|Psychoactive {{substances}} often {{bring about}} subjective (although {{these may be}} objectively observed) changes in consciousness and mood that the user may find rewarding and pleasant (e.g., euphoria or a sense of relaxation) or advantageous (e.g. increased alertness) and are thus reinforcing. Substances which are both rewarding and positively reinforcing {{have the potential to}} induce a state of addiction– compulsive drug use despite negative consequences. In addition, sustained use of some substances may produce physical or psychological dependence or both, associated with somatic or psychological-emotional withdrawal states respectively. Drug rehabilitation attempts to reduce addiction, through a combination of psychotherapy, support groups, and other psychoactive substances. Conversely, certain psychoactive drugs may be so unpleasant that the person will never use the substance again. This is especially true of certain deliriants (e.g. <b>Jimson</b> weed), powerful dissociatives (e.g. Salvia divinorum), and classic psychedelics (e.g. LSD, psilocybin), {{in the form of a}} [...] "bad trip".|$|E

Another role which is sometimes referred to as one which he considered his best and is so considered by many critics, is that of Colonel Jock Sinclair in Tunes of Glory (1960). Guinness also played the role of Jamessir Bensonmum, the blind butler, in the 1976 Neil Simon film Murder by Death.|$|E

6000|$|... "The whole affair!" [...] cried Gideon. [...] "That man {{has been}} ass enough to steal the cart and the dead body; what he hopes {{to do with it}} I neither know nor care.

60|$|<b>Jimson,</b> {{a man of}} {{inconspicuous}} costume, but insinuating manners, {{had little}} difficulty in finding the hireling who had charge of the houseboat, and still less in persuading him to resign his care.

6000|$|... "Mr. Jimson," [...] she cried, [...] "Mr. <b>Jimson!</b> here, come!--you must come, you know, {{sooner or}} later, for I can't get off without you. O, don't be so {{exceedingly}} silly! O, please, come!" ...|$|E
60|$|He had {{scarcely}} spoken {{when there}} was a movement {{at the door of the}} cell and, by the light of a lantern, the boys found themselves confronted by Sack Todd, Andy <b>Jimson</b> and Dan Baxter.|$|E
60|$|Again {{there was}} silence, {{and once more}} the boys dozed off, not to rouse up until there came the {{unlocking}} of the cell door. Sack Todd stood there, lantern in hand, and beside him Andy <b>Jimson.</b>|$|E
60|$|As {{it would}} have been useless to struggle, the boys did not attempt to get away. Both Sack Todd and <b>Jimson</b> were heavily armed, and Dick and Sam felt that they would shoot upon the {{slightest}} provocation.|$|E
60|$|They {{were just}} {{preparing}} to move for town, {{when they saw}} two of the posse returning with three prisoners, each disarmed and with his hands bound behind him. One of the prisoners was Puller and another Andy <b>Jimson.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "By jingo!" [...] he {{said all}} at once, {{stopping}} short, with the ax on his shoulder. [...] "If I hadn't 'a' been robbed I wouldn't 'a' come here--I never'd met Merry. Thunder and <b>jimson</b> root! Wasn't that a narrow escape?" ...|$|E
60|$|And, sure enough, {{about the}} hour of noon on the {{following}} day, <b>Jimson</b> might have been observed ascending the river-side road that goes from Padwick to Great Haverham, carrying in one hand a basket of provisions, and under the other arm a leather case containing (it is to be conjectured) the score of Orange Pekoe. It was October weather; the stone-grey sky was full of larks, the leaden mirror of the Thames brightened with autumnal foliage, and the fallen leaves of the chestnuts chirped under the composer's footing. There is no {{time of the year}} in England more courageous; and <b>Jimson,</b> though he was not without his troubles, whistled as he went.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{am going}} to run no chances with you," [...] {{continued}} Andy <b>Jimson.</b> [...] "You have got to keep very quiet. Don't you open your mouth once after we get started. I've got a pistol handy, and I {{know how to use}} it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's the thing!" [...] cried Gideon; [...] "and to-morrow {{there will}} be no houseboat, and no <b>Jimson,</b> and no carrier's cart, and no piano; and when Harker awakes on the ditch-side, he may tell himself the whole affair has been a dream." ...|$|E
6000|$|Julia {{began to}} feel a certain interest. [...] "I am afraid you are really quite ill," [...] she said, drawing a little nearer. [...] "Please don't let me put you out, and do not stay under that table, Mr. <b>Jimson.</b> Indeed it cannot be good for you." ...|$|E
60|$|So {{they had}} pork and beans, {{to the great}} {{disappointment}} of Mr. <b>Jimson,</b> who had expected to eat duck instead; and after dinner the little man lay down {{to take a nap}} while his wife went out to tell the neighbors what a great hunter he was.|$|E
