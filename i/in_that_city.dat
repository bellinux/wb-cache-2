Despite this agenda, Ottoi was not employed as a political panelist, but, as a practicing physician, held Searas advice column.|$|E

5|$|The Old Strathcona Foundation {{was running}} a major deficit by 1996, and in April Edmonton City Council {{declined}} to renew a $100,000 annual grant which the Foundation had received since 1985. The Foundation needed cash, and quickly sold the theatre for $450,000 to Calgary’s Brar family, owners of the Plaza Theatre <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>city.</b> The decision was not popular, and even Old Strathcona Foundation member Judy Berghofer called the sale hasty.|$|E
5|$|After {{a vacancy}} of five years, the see of Philadelphia {{found a new}} bishop in Henry Conwell, an Irish-born priest who was {{installed}} in 1819 and arrived the next year, freeing de Barth to return to Conewago.

5|$|Bache {{had long}} {{cherished}} the wish of bringing Liszt to London, which Liszt had last visited in 1841 while still a touring virtuoso, and Liszt knew that whatever standing his music had <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>city</b> had {{in large part}} to do with Bache's efforts. At least in part to repay the debt he felt he owed Bache, Liszt accepted Bache's invitation to attend celebrations in April 1886 to commemorate Liszt's 75th birthday. These celebrations included the foundation of a Liszt piano scholarship at the Royal Academy of Music, a performance of his oratorio The Legend of Saint Elizabeth led by Alexander Mackenzie in St. James's Hall, an audience with Queen Victoria and a public reception in Liszt's honour at the Grosvenor Gallery. Bache was involved in all four of these events, which were highly successful; by popular demand, Saint Elizabeth had to be repeated at the Crystal Palace.|$|E

5|$|By 2006, Oliver {{had held}} 18 solo {{exhibitions}} of her work, {{half of them}} at Roslyn Oxley9 Gallery, which represented her throughout {{her career as a}} sculptor. Only one of those solo exhibitions was held outside Australia: a 1992 exhibition at Auckland City Gallery. However, Oliver was represented in numerous international group shows, including five during the period 1983 to 1984, around the time she completed her master's degree in London. Four of the group shows at that time were in the United Kingdom; the fifth was at the Museum of Traditional Industries in Kyoto. Subsequent international group shows included 'Five Australian Artists' at Brest's Centre Culturale in 1988, the year she undertook an artist's residency <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>city.</b> Later group shows of which Oliver was part included 'Prospect '93' at the Frankfurter Kunstverein, 'Systems End: Contemporary Art in Australia', which exhibited in several east Asian galleries in 1996, and the Beijing International Biennale in 2003.|$|E
5|$|Fed by {{intelligence}} {{from the}} Soviet Union, the North Koreans were aware the UN forces were building {{up along the}} Pusan Perimeter {{and that they had}} to conduct an offensive soon or else forfeit the battle. In planning its new offensive, the North Korean commanders decided that any attempt to flank the UN force was impossible thanks to the support of the UN navy. Instead, they opted to use frontal attacks to breach the perimeter and collapse it. A secondary objective was to surround Taegu and destroy the UN and ROK units <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>city.</b> As part of this mission, the North Korean units would first cut the supply lines to Taegu.|$|E

Among those charged in Goebel's murder was Governor Taylor's Secretary of State, Caleb Powers. Powers employed Brown as his legal counsel during his first trial, which ended in a conviction in July 1900. Brown died January 11, 1904, in Henderson and was buried at the Fernwood Cemetery <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>city.</b> He was the namesake of, but not related to, 20th century Kentucky Congressman John Y. Brown, Sr.|$|E

5|$|Hoping {{to become}} a teacher, Soeman tried out for a course for {{potential}} teachers in Medan, North Sumatra, soon after graduation. After he was accepted, he spent two years studying <b>in</b> <b>that</b> <b>city.</b> Among his teachers was , whose later short story collection Teman Doedoek (1937) became the first such work in the Indonesian literary canon.

After two years in Medan, Soeman continued to a normal school in Langsa, Aceh, where he stayed until 1923. There he met his future wife, Siti Hasnah.|$|E
