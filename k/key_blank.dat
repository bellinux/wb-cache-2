50|$|Key {{duplication}} {{is available}} in many retail hardware stores and as a service of the specialized locksmith, though the correct <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> may not be available. More recently, online services for duplicating keys have become available.|$|E
50|$|A keyhole (or keyway) is a hole or {{aperture}} (as in a door or lock) {{for receiving}} a key. Lock keyway shapes vary widely with lock manufacturer, and many manufacturers {{have a number}} of unique profiles requiring a specifically milled <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> to engage the lock's tumblers.|$|E
50|$|Silca’s core {{business}} {{is represented by}} the production of <b>key</b> <b>blanks,</b> with a product range of over 66,000 items designed for the most diverse uses, from airplanes to mail-boxes keys.|$|R
5000|$|Meanwhile, {{companies}} like Hurd and Briggs and Stratton were making OEM <b>key</b> <b>blanks</b> with automaker's logos on them. These {{became known as}} [...] "Logo Blanks". These <b>key</b> <b>blanks</b> {{were the same as}} the original keys issued by the automaker and allowed an enthusiast to maintain the stock look of his or her keys. Picky car show judges will often score a vehicle down for not having an correct OEM set of keys with the original lock code stamped on them. Unfortunately, many of these original logo blanks are no longer manufactured and are only available from dwindling NOS supplies from internet places such as eBay.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 Kaba Holding AG {{took over}} the Unican Group, {{creating}} {{one of the largest}} companies worldwide operating within the security business.In the first decade of 2000 Silca has increased the functions and technologies applied to its key cutting machines and the launch of customised finishing for <b>key</b> <b>blanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|There {{are seven}} {{different}} keyways: C, CE, E, EF, F, FG, and G. There {{is also a}} special P keyway designed to accept any of the seven sectional keys and a special L <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> (35-101 L) designed to be accepted into all seven keyways. OEM L section blanks are made of stainless steel.|$|E
5000|$|Despite common belief, keys {{stamped with}} [...] "Do not duplicate" [...] or [...] "It is {{unlawful}} to duplicate this key" [...] are, with few exceptions, perfectly legal to duplicate. Some <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> manufacturers strictly restrict {{the sale of}} their own blanks. Some blanks are made only in small volumes and are not widely available.|$|E
50|$|In Unix-like {{operating}} systems, sort is {{a standard}} command line program that prints the lines of its input or concatenation of all files listed in its argument list in sorted order. Sorting is done based on one or more sort keys extracted from each line of input. By default, the entire input is taken as sort <b>key.</b> <b>Blank</b> space is the default field separator.|$|E
50|$|Unican Security Systems Ltd. was a Canadian-based company {{created by}} Aaron Fish in the 1960s {{and sold in}} 2000. At its sale (to Kaba Group), the company had over $800 million in sales {{annually}} and was the largest maker of <b>key</b> <b>blanks</b> and <b>key</b> copying machines in the world.|$|R
50|$|Key control (advantages): Due to the {{magnetic}} cylinder elements {{embedded in the}} keys, {{there is a high}} degree of key control. Unlawful key duplications are minimized by limited access to <b>key</b> <b>blanks</b> (locksmiths) and unique magnetic coding in the key that cannot easily be determined by inspecting the target lock.|$|R
50|$|Because a {{bump key}} must {{only have the}} same blank profile as the lock it is made to open, {{restricted}} or registered key profiles are not any safer from bumping. While the correct <b>key</b> <b>blanks</b> cannot be obtained legally without permission or registration with relevant locksmith associations, regular keys can be filed down to act as bump keys.|$|R
50|$|Additive {{manufacturing}} of keysUnlike most ordinary keys {{which were}} produced by <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> stamping and subsequent hole drilling, the Stealth key is a mechanical key made by additive manufacturing (3D metal printed). It {{was a major}} disruption to the key manufacturing status quo and took {{full advantage of the}} novel manufacturing process, i.e. complex internal features and a batch size of one (each single key in the printed batch is unique).|$|E
5000|$|The bitting {{is usually}} a series of {{integers}} (e.g. 372164) that is usually translated from a key code chart or from a bitting code list to settings on specially designed key machines. In many code systems each digit in the bitting corresponds to a certain location on the <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> where a cut or notch is to be made and also indicates the necessary depth of the cut.|$|E
50|$|A <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> (sometimes spelled keyblank) is a {{key that}} has not been cut to a {{specific}} bitting. The blank has a specific cross-sectional profile to match the keyway in a corresponding lock cylinder. Key blanks can be stamped with a manufacturer name, end-user logo or with a phrase, the most commonly seen being 'Do not duplicate'. Blanks are typically stocked by locksmiths for duplicating keys. The profile of the key bow, or the large, flat end, is often characteristic of an individual manufacturer.|$|E
50|$|No {{two copies}} of keys are exactly the same, {{even if they were}} both made from <b>key</b> <b>blanks</b> that are struck from the same mould or cut from the same duplicating/milling machine with no changes to the bitting {{settings}} in between. Even under these favorable circumstances, there will be minute differences between the two key shapes, though their key relevance is extremely high.|$|R
50|$|Kwikset is an American {{lock and}} lockset {{manufacturer}} owned by Spectrum Brands Hardware and Home Improvement Group (HHI), a Division of Spectrum Brands. Kwikset {{was founded in}} 1946 by Adolf Schoepe and Karl Rhinehart. The name {{was derived from the}} company's first locks, which pioneered the then-revolutionary tubular lock design, which were relatively fast to install. Kwikset <b>key</b> <b>blanks</b> (KW1 or Axxess #66) are available at almost every location where keys can be made.|$|R
50|$|Another way to {{restrict}} keys is trademarking {{the profile of}} the key.For example, {{the profile of the}} key can read the name of the manufacturer.The advantage of a trademark is that the legal protection for a trademark can be longer than the legal protection for a patent.However, usually not all features of the profile are necessary to create a working key.By removing certain unnecessary features, a non restricted profile can be derived, allowing the production and distribution of non restricted <b>key</b> <b>blanks.</b>|$|R
50|$|Duplicating keys by {{this process}} is more labor intense and {{requires}} somewhat better trained personnel. However, keys made in this fashion have clean margins {{and the depth of}} the notches are not subject to wear induced changes encountered when heavily worn keys are duplicated using a pattern grinder. Keys may also be made in this fashion without an original as long as the depth of each notch and the type of <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> are known. This is particularly useful for institutions with a great number of locks for which {{they do not want to}} maintain a wide variety of archived copies.|$|E
50|$|A {{restricted}} keyblank has a keyway {{for which}} a manufacturer {{has set up a}} restricted level of sales and distribution. Restricted keys are often protected by patent, which prohibits other manufacturers from making unauthorized productions of the <b>key</b> <b>blank.</b> In many cases, customers must provide proof of ID before a locksmith will cut additional keys using restricted blanks. Some companies, such as Medeco High Security Locks, have keyways that are restricted to having keys cut in the factory only. This is done to ensure the highest amount of security. These days, many restricted keys have special in-laid features, such as magnets, different types of metal, or even small computer chips to prevent duplication.|$|E
50|$|As {{a benefit}} to keying from blade tip to bow, a six- or seven-pin {{interchangeable}} core <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> can be machined to precisely fit a smaller five-pin system configuration. Although the blade of such keys may be a pin or two longer than need be, this extra length never enters the locking mechanism; therefore, five-, six- and seven-pin interchangeable core systems can be easily integrated to work with one another or to provide different levels of access control within the same system. Conventional cylinder and removable core systems are significantly more limited in this regard since the extra length of their keys must pass through {{to the inside of}} the locking mechanism, which is often just not physically possible.|$|E
5000|$|A {{practical}} attack {{exists to}} create a working master key for an entire system given only access to a single master-keyed lock, its associated change key, a supply of appropriate <b>key</b> <b>blanks,</b> {{and the ability to}} cut new keys. This is described in a 2002 paper by cryptographer Matt Blaze, however for systems with many levels of master keys {{it may be necessary to}} collect information from locks in different [...] "subsystems" [...] in order to deduce the master key.|$|R

50|$|This is a {{large family}} of keyways {{expressed}} as four numbers. Except for zeros, digits in the keyway designation cannot repeat; i.e. 3578, 1358 and 1200 are valid, but 1244 and 3300 are not. Primus cannot be implemented on this series. The digit 9 is not used. Each digit represents {{the presence of a}} notch in the keyway and a corresponding protrusion along the blade of the key. The odd digits 1, 3, 5, and 7 extend along {{the left side of the}} keyway as observed from the lock face from bottom to top. The even digits are likewise, on the right side. Generally, keyways are identified by four non-zero digits in ascending order. In a large masterkey system, keys with fewer than four protrusions can be used to enter more than one keyway. For example, <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> 1460 will fit lock cylinder 1246, 1346, 1467, etc.|$|E
40|$|Several {{attacks against}} {{physical}} pin-tumbler locks re-quire access {{to one or}} more key blanks to perform. These attacks include bumping, impressioning, rights-amplification, and teleduplication. To mitigate these at-tacks, many lock systems rely on restricted keyways and use blanks that are not sold to the general public, making it harder for attackers to obtain them. Often the <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> designs themselves are patented, further discouraging dis-tribution or manufacture by even skilled machinists. In this paper we investigate the impact that emerging rapid prototyping—or 3 D printing—tools have on the se-curity of these restricted keyway systems. We find that commodity 3 D printers are able to produce key blanks and pre-cut keys with enough resolution to work in several commonly used pin-tumbler locks and that their material is strong enough to withstand the requirements to per-form the aforementioned attacks. In addition, in order to demonstrate the low skill requirements necessary to perform these attacks, we develop a tool that automati-cally generates a 3 D printable CAD model of a <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> using only a single picture of a lock’s keyway. This tool allows us to rapidly manufacture key blanks for restricted keyways that were previously difficult to make or buy. Finally, we discuss possible mitigations for these attacks that lock manufacturers, installers, and users can perform to protect their assets. ...|$|E

40|$|Different {{groups of}} pigeons {{received}} discrimination training {{in which the}} reinforcement-associated and extinction-associated stimuli were respectively either (a) a line tilt vs a <b>blank</b> <b>key,</b> (b) a <b>blank</b> <b>key</b> vs a line tilt, or (c) two different line tilts. The high response rates that developed to the positive stimulus in all groups during discrimination learning were maintained over 64 sessions of training. After these sessions, all subjects were tested for stimulus generalization along the line-tilt dimension. Gradients of relative (per cent) generalization around the stimulus associated with reinforcement (so-called excitatory gradients) and around the stimulus associated with extinction (so-called inhibitory gradients) were as steep as they typically are after much briefer training periods. These results do not support several of Terrace's predictions {{on the basis of}} the hypothesis that emotional responses develop to the stimulus associated with extinction during discrimination learning with errors, but eventually dissipate after extended training...|$|R
50|$|The bitting code is the {{translated}} blind code {{which the}} locksmith actually uses to cut each <b>blank</b> <b>key.</b> Example: padlock blind code W123 translates to bitting code 25313, {{to which the}} locksmith would cut the key with his code machine by setting it to 25313.|$|R
40|$|In this paper, {{we develop}} and study a new {{algorithm}} {{to recognize and}} precisely measure keys for the ultimate purpose of physically duplicating them. The main challenge {{comes from the fact}} that the proposed algorithm must use a single picture of the key obtained from a regular desktop scanner without any special preparation. It does not use the special lasers, lighting systems, or camera setups commonly used for the purpose of key measuring, nor does it require that the key be placed in a precise position and orientation. Instead, we propose an algorithm that uses a wide range of image processing methods to discover all the information needed to identify the correct <b>key</b> <b>blank</b> and to find precise measures of the notches of the key shank from the single scanned image alone. Our results show that our algorithm can correctly differentiate between different key models and can measure the dents of the key with a precision of a few tenths of a millimeter...|$|E

Visual layouts vary by language, country, and user preference, and any one mechanical and functional layout can be employed {{with a number of}} different visual layouts. For example, the “ISO” keyboard layout is used throughout Europe, but typical French, German, and UK variants of mechanically identical keyboards appear different because they bear different legends on their <b>keys.</b> Even <b>blank</b> keyboards – with no legends – are sometimes used to learn typing skills or by user preference.|$|R
