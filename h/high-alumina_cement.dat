[...] In response to this growth, St John the Baptist's Roman Catholic church established a small Mass centre, dedicated to St Louis of France, on the estate in 1964. [...] It was in use for just 18 years because it was built with <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cement,</b> a dangerous material which often made buildings structurally unsound.

[...] Eight years later, residents of Portslade (a former urban district which became part of Hove in 1974) lost their 80-year-old church when the site was redeveloped for housing.|$|E
40|$|Corrosion {{characteristics}} of reinforcement in modified <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cement</b> (HAC) containing a conversion-preventing additive (CPA) was studied. An investigation {{was carried out}} using ordinary portland cement, <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cement,</b> and modified <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cement.</b> Results includingcompressive strength, bond strength, porosity, CT permeability, and extent of steel bar corrosion are presented. The effect of a deicing salt, calcium chloride, on formation of hydrogarnet and str 4 tlingite in HAC and modified HAC mortars is also reported. This work indicates that HAC mortar, after conversion, is unable to protect the reinforcement from corrosion in an environment containing chloride ions. Conversion-inhibited <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cement</b> has the capability of protecting the reinforcement fromcorrosion under severe test conditions due to its effective resistance to the penetration of chloride ions.

40|$|The latest {{research}} on the reactivity toward cross-linking of inorganic matrixes formed by cement-based materials, and the associated grafting at the nanoscopic and atomic levels, is highly promising. Macro-defect-free (MDF) materials and technologies were originally comprised of <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cements</b> cross-linked to poly(vinyl alcohol/acetate) or of portland cement with poly(acrylamide). Although the high-alumina system has shown promising results and is the more efficient system, it suffers from economic disadvantages; modern efforts to identify MDF systems focus on portland cement {{and a variety of}} polymer additives. We report recent findings regarding the potential and limitations of portland cement-based MDF materials, considering aspects of the associated chemistry (at the nanoscopic and atomic levels), of the mechanism linking polymer to the surface of cement grains, and of technologically relevant attributes such as moisture resistance of the formed MDF material...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. At low {{temperature}} (T<lO°C), CaAl 201 fio is formed by hydration of <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cements</b> (HACs). HACs {{are used for}} rekactory applications; heat treatments then lead to thermal decomposition of CaAl 201 fio. which first dehydrates to CaAl~ 04 & (X < 10) and finally to the anhydrous phase CaA 1204. In CaAlzOl&, aluminium atoms are 6 -coordinated, whereas they are 4 -coordinated in CaAl 20. 4. Materials heat-treated between 120 °C and 900 °C are amorphous and, therefore, only short-range order techniques {{can be used to}} study the environment of ions, in particular calcium.

Our innovation is then to study the changes in calcium and aluminium environments during CaAl 201 dI 20 dehydration by X-ray absorption spectroscopy (EXAFS and XANES).

The method has been applied to three systems: a model component of portland cement, a <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cement</b> and an ettringite-based cement. The results show how this technique might be used to gather information on the kinetics of the chemical processes involved.

40|$|Refractory lining materials, {{which include}} ceramic {{refractories}} and nonfired heat-resistant concretes, {{have a very}} short lifespan during the turnaround time measured in years and sometimes months. Therefore, increasing the service life of thermal generating units by 1. 5 - 2 times will bring significant economic benefits. The main factor that determines the durability of refractory lining materials is the thermal resistance. It is possible to increase the thermal resistance by improving such physical and mechanical properties as strength and density. As for the ceramic refractory performance improvement, such technological methods as their structural and chemical modification by phosphate binder impregnation, as well as introduction of phosphate components into the ceramic batches during the molding process increase, in particular, their thermal stability. The use of aluminous and <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cements</b> contributes to a significant increase of not only strength, but also physical and thermal performance of heat-resistant concretes with different fillers. Switching {{to the use of}} chemical binders in the compositions of heat-resistant concretes (liquid glass with effective hardeners; silicate-block and phosphate binders) enables to develop high-heat resistant materials which do not soften {{in a wide range of}} heating temperatures from 400 °С to 1600 °С. The positive results on increasing the thermal resistance of heat-resistant composites can be obtained by reinforcing them with high temperature fibers...|$|R

40|$|It {{is known}} that the initial product of {{hydration}} of <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cement</b> at low temperatures, often labeled "CAH(10)," contains both crystalline and amorphous portions.

The DTG signal of the compound was decomposed in four different kinetic processes. The nature of the water liberated in each process was characterized by the shape parameters of the process. The x-ray diffractograms at different temperatures showed two volume variations of the CAH(x) compound, related to contractions in the c parameter before the collapse of the structure to yield an amorphous phase.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In this work, {{we studied}} {{the effect of}} {{carboxylic}} acid on the rheological properties of a <b>high-alumina</b> <b>cement</b> mortar (CH 45) produced by the Algerian firm REFRACTAL. The investigated properties are setting time, water consumption, electrical conductivity, pH, density and the compressive strength. The results show a setting time of about 200 min for the acid free, 180 min with 0. 1 % of carboxylic acid and 18 hours with 2 % of this acid. A significant reduction in water consumption was noticed. The water/cement ratio of the acid free-mortar is reduced from 0. 24 to 0. 16 with 2 % acid. The rheological investigations carried out on the mortar-water mixtures with and without carboxylic acid show a Newtonian behavior.

The samples with polymer latex performed poorly in most tests, while the control and samples with accelerator and superplasticizer performed well in both laboratory exposure conditions and on the maritime site.

5000|$|The cement {{is made by}} fusing {{together}} a mixture of a calcium-bearing material (normally calcium oxide from limestone) and an aluminium-bearing material (normally bauxite for general purposes, or refined alumina for white and refractory cements). The liquified mixture cools to a vesicular, basalt-like clinker which is ground alone to produce the finished product. Because complete melting usually takes place, raw materials in lump-form can be used. A typical kiln arrangement comprises a reverberatory furnace provided with a shaft preheater in which the hot exhaust gases pass upward as the lump raw material mix passes downward. The preheater recuperates most of the heat in the combustion gases, dehydrates and de-hydroxylates the bauxite and de-carbonates the limestone. The calcined material drops into the [...] "cool end" [...] of the melt bath. The melt overflows the hot end of the furnace into molds in which it cools and solidifies. The system is fired with pulverized coal or oil. The cooled clinker ingots are crushed and ground in a ball-mill. In the case of <b>high-alumina</b> refractory <b>cements,</b> where the mix only sinters, a rotary kiln can be used.|$|R

Verificou-se a influência de ambas as distribuições discreta e acumulada, baseadas no modelo de empacotamento de Andreasen. Ensaios de permeabilidade ao ar à temperatura ambiente permitiram correlacionar os tipos de poros presentes no concreto com a facilidade de escoamento de fluidos. Ensaios de permeabilidade em temperaturas elevadas foram utilizados para acompanhar a decomposição de hidratos. A análise termogravimétrica permitiu associar as características da estrutura com a facilidade de eliminação de água durante o processo de secagem.

Part of colloidal silica combines with calcium and aluminum to form cristobalite, which is stabilised in its [MATH]-form. Shrinkage was measured by dilatometry.
