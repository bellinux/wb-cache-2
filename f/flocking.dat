5|$|While some {{birds are}} {{essentially}} territorial or live in small family groups, other birds may form large flocks. The principal benefits of <b>flocking</b> are safety in numbers and increased foraging efficiency. Defence against predators {{is particularly important}} in closed habitats like forests, where ambush predation is common and multiple eyes can provide a valuable early warning system. This {{has led to the}} development of many mixed-species feeding flocks, which are usually composed of small numbers of many species; these flocks provide safety in numbers but increase potential competition for resources. Costs of <b>flocking</b> include bullying of socially subordinate birds by more dominant birds and the reduction of feeding efficiency in certain cases.|$|E
40|$|Habitat {{degradation}} affects mixed-species bird <b>flocks</b> (<b>flock</b> hereafter) {{through two}} mechanisms – {{changes in the}} bird community from which <b>flocks</b> are drawn {{and changes in the}} propensities of species to <b>flock.</b> We determined the relative influence of these two mechanisms by examining variation in <b>flocks</b> across nine rain-forest fragments (range 11 – 2600 ha) in a plantation landscape in the Western Ghats, India. We found differences between fragments in average number of species (range 10. 8 – 15. 2) and individuals (range 19. 0 – 37. 6) per <b>flock,</b> number of species that participated in <b>flocks</b> (range 34 – 59), encounter rates (range 0. 5 – 2. 4 <b>flocks</b> $h^{- 1 }$) and <b>flock</b> composition. Multiple regression and randomization tests revealed that different mechanisms contributed to this variation. Three <b>flock</b> variables (open-forest individuals per <b>flock,</b> total open-forest species that participated in <b>flocks</b> in a fragment, <b>flock</b> composition) mainly reflected changes in the bird communities of fragments. Habitat structure strongly influenced three <b>flock</b> variables (open-forest species per <b>flock,</b> total and rain-forest individuals per <b>flock)</b> and <b>flock</b> composition to a lesser extent. Finally, <b>flock</b> encounter rate was strongly related to fragment area, but not to abundance of <b>flock</b> participants indicating habitat degradation-induced changes in propensities of species to <b>flock...</b>|$|R

The objective in this study was to assess levels of connectedness in the genetic evaluation of weaning weight among Targhee and Suffolk <b>flocks</b> participating in the US National Sheep Improvement Program (NSIP). Among <b>flocks</b> currently participating in the NSIP, a total of 25, 404 weaning weight and 35, 794 pedigree records were available for 16 Targhee <b>flocks,</b> and 14, 017 weaning weight and 18, 311 pedigree records were available for 24 Suffolk <b>flocks.</b> Connectedness was measured by using 2 different methods. First, numbers of progeny with recorded weaning weights from linking sires (defined as sires with progeny in multiple <b>flocks</b> or sires born in one <b>flock</b> with progeny in another <b>flock)</b> were counted. Second, connectedness was measured by calculating the average prediction error correlation of mean <b>flock</b> EBV (<b>flock</b> rij). Benchmarks for <b>flock</b> rij were established, with 0. 10 and 0. 05 representing low and moderate risk of bias associated with comparing EBV among <b>flocks,</b> respectively. From 1995 through 2004, 44 % of Targhee lambs with weaning weights were born to linking sires; in Suffolk lambs, that value was 23 %. In 1990, 1995, and 2005, average <b>flock</b> rij were 0. 10, 0. 19, and 0. 28, respectively, among Targhee <b>flocks,</b> and 0. 02, 0. 02, and 0. 04, respectively, among Suffolk <b>flocks</b> that participated in NSIP in all 3 yr. Among all active <b>flocks</b> in 2005, <b>flock</b> rij averaged 0. 13 in Targhees and 0. 03 in Suffolks. Hierarchical clustering of <b>flocks</b> based on <b>flock</b> rij revealed that all active Targhee <b>flocks</b> connected at a level near or above 0. 10. In Suffolk <b>flocks,</b> 2 distinct clusters had formed, in which connectedness was relatively high within each cluster (<b>flock</b> rij near 0. 10) but was near zero between clusters. Risk of bias in comparing EBV among <b>flocks</b> in the Targhee was low; however, caution should be exercised when comparing EBV between Suffolk <b>flocks</b> from different clusters...|$|R

In the <b>flock</b> with manifested respiratory disorders which was marked as <b>flock</b> number one (<b>flock</b> 1), high seroprevalence of specific antibodies for O. rhinotracheale (46 %) was found in 30 -day-old broiler chickens. The symptoms presented were: depression, reduction in feed consumption and water intake, sneezing, mucosal nasal discharge and facial edema. Production results were below technological standards due to increased mortality, decreased growth range and increased number of stunted chickens. Autopsy found frequent changes in the trachea, air sacs and lungs, which were manifested as: tracheitis catarrhalis, aerosacculitis fibrinosa and pneumonia fibrinosa. In control <b>flocks</b> marked as <b>flock</b> number two (<b>flock</b> 2) and <b>flock</b> number three (<b>flock</b> 3) where 4 % and 8 % of seropositive chickens were found, there were no clinical signs which would indicate illness, and production results were much closer to technological standards as compared with <b>flock</b> 1.

5|$|Some birds, {{especially}} corvids and parrots, {{are among}} the most intelligent animals; several bird species make and use tools, and many social species pass on knowledge across generations, which is considered a form of culture. Many species annually migrate great distances. Birds are social, communicating with visual signals, calls, and bird songs, and participating in such social behaviours as cooperative breeding and hunting, <b>flocking,</b> and mobbing of predators. The vast majority of bird species are socially monogamous (referring to social living arrangement, distinct from genetic monogamy), usually for one breeding season at a time, sometimes for years, but rarely for life. Other species have breeding systems that are polygynous (arrangement of one male with many females) or, rarely, polyandrous (arrangement of one female with many males). Birds produce offspring by laying eggs which are fertilised through sexual reproduction. They are usually laid in a nest and incubated by the parents. Most birds have an extended period of parental care after hatching. Some birds, such as hens, lay eggs even when not fertilised, though unfertilised eggs do not produce offspring.|$|E
5|$|The first {{potential}} {{evidence for}} herding or <b>flocking</b> as a widespread behavior common to many dinosaur groups {{in addition to}} birds was the 1878 discovery of 31Iguanodon bernissartensis, ornithischians that were then thought to have perished together in Bernissart, Belgium, after they fell into a deep, flooded sinkhole and drowned. Other mass-death sites have been discovered subsequently. Those, along with multiple trackways, suggest that gregarious behavior was common in many early dinosaur species. Trackways of hundreds or even thousands of herbivores indicate that duck-bills (hadrosaurids) may have moved in great herds, like the American bison or the African Springbok. Sauropod tracks document that these animals traveled in groups composed of several different species, at least in Oxfordshire, England, {{although there is no}} evidence for specific herd structures. Congregating into herds may have evolved for defense, for migratory purposes, or to provide protection for young. There is evidence that many types of slow-growing dinosaurs, including various theropods, sauropods, ankylosaurians, ornithopods, and ceratopsians, formed aggregations of immature individuals. One example is a site in Inner Mongolia that has yielded the remains of over 20 Sinornithomimus, from one to seven years old. This assemblage is interpreted as a social group that was trapped in mud. The interpretation of dinosaurs as gregarious has also extended to depicting carnivorous theropods as pack hunters working together to bring down large prey. However, this lifestyle is uncommon among modern birds, crocodiles, and other reptiles, and the taphonomic evidence suggesting mammal-like pack hunting in such theropods as Deinonychus and Allosaurus can also be interpreted as the results of fatal disputes between feeding animals, as is seen in many modern diapsid predators.|$|E

Birds flying on very different flight paths were occasionally observed to become temporary close neighbors due to the crossing of the arcs describing the flight paths of the birds. Under such conditions birds could possibly be detected as a physical clump of close neighbors within the overall structure of the <b>flock.</b> Birds in <b>flock</b> performed aerial flight maneuvers while maintaining or increasing the compactness of the <b>flock</b> structure. The relative positions of birds within the <b>flocks</b> were not fixed. The repositioning of birds within the overall structure of turning and wheeling <b>flocks</b> indicates that adaptive strategies for predator avoidance could be based on a bird 2 ̆ 7 s ability to easily reposition within a <b>flock,</b> rather than on the distinctly different advantages of maintaining a peripheral or central location within the <b>flock.</b> Behaviorally dominant and subordinate birds did not maintain specific positions within the airborne <b>flocks.</b> There was a tendency for birds of dissimilar dominance rank to be nearest neighbors within the airborne <b>flocks...</b>|$|R
50|$|Much {{remained}} the same until the First World War, when the Southdown <b>flocks</b> declined with some rapidity, as shepherds and farm workers went off to war. By 1922, the 359 pedigree <b>flocks</b> had shrunk to 245. From then until 1939, the registered Southdown <b>flocks</b> numbered around 200. Folded <b>flocks</b> were no longer economical and smaller <b>flocks</b> averaged only 135 ewes apiece.|$|R
