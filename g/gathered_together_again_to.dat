60|$|The {{first night}} passed without any alarm, the monk and his hosts {{spending}} the dreary hours in watching and waiting. The following day, however, was as stormy {{as the worst}} enemy of the ferry could have wished, and, when night fell, all the dwellers in the cottage, {{as well as the}} silent monk, <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> wait for the cries, but some hours passed without any other sounds having been heard than those caused by the restless wind, as it swept over the lake and among the trees. The Cistercian was beginning to imagine himself the victim of an irreverent practical joke, and that the stories of the spectral crier which had reached the distant abbey long before the ferryman's visit were a pack of falsehoods, when about midnight, he suddenly jumped from the chair upon which he was dozing by the wood fire, hastily made the sign of the cross, and hurriedly commended himself to the protection of his patron saint, for sharp and clear came the dread cry, followed rapidly by a number of shrieks and groans and a smothered appeal for a boat.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "classic" [...] {{lineup of}} the band {{consisting}} of Walsh, Peters and Fox first reunited in July 1991 at Nautica Pavilion in Cleveland when Fox and Peters took to the stage during a Walsh concert to play three songs. The trio then <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> perform at an election rally for President Bill Clinton at the Cleveland State University Convocation Center on November 4, 1996. They also appeared on The Drew Carey Show in the 1998-99 season and at the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and the Allen Theater in Cleveland for three shows in February 2001, joined by keyboardist Mark Avsec (ex-Wild Cherry and Donnie Iris & the Cruisers). And {{in the summer of}} 2005, the group performed another handful of shows (joined again by Avsec) in the Cleveland area.|$|E
50|$|Thirteen friends meet to {{celebrate}} Vicky’s birthday. This {{is the first}} time that most of them <b>gather</b> <b>together</b> <b>again.</b> Resentments, guilt, pain and the fiction of their own memories are being revealed along the night.|$|R
60|$|Elfride looked annoyed and guilty. 'They {{are only}} {{something}} of mine, papa,' she faltered, whilst Stephen leapt out, and, assisted by the lodge-keeper's little boy, crept about round the wheels and horse's hoofs till the papers were all <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> <b>again.</b> He handed {{them back to}} her, and remounted.|$|R
60|$|It may be objected {{that the}} ballast men might do this; that {{as fast as}} the hills are taken away they would <b>gather</b> <b>together</b> <b>again,</b> or that the watermen might do it. To the first, I answer, that ballast men, instead of taking away from these hills, make holes in other places of the river, which is the reason so many young persons are drowned when {{swimming}} or bathing in the river.|$|R
50|$|Remarkably, Tarachodes afzelii {{continues}} {{her care}} of her nymphs after they hatch out in about three weeks. For about two days, they cluster round her, and <b>gather</b> <b>together</b> <b>again</b> in her vicinity after a disturbance. At this stage they are vulnerable to attack by jumping spiders, and ants of the genera Dorylus and Megaponera. It is conceivable that the female might catch prey and allow her offspring to consume it, but such behaviour has not been observed.|$|R
5000|$|In February 828 {{the last}} Friulian dux, Baldric, {{was removed from}} office by Emperor Louis the Pious at the Imperial diet of Aachen, as {{he had not been}} able to defend the Pannonian {{frontier}} against the troops of Khan Omurtag of Bulgaria. The duchy was divided into four counties, which in 846 were <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> <b>again</b> as part of the Middle Frankish realm ruled by Louis' eldest son Emperor Lothair I. He bestowed Friuli on his brother-in-law Eberhard, of the Frankish Unruochings, with the title of dux, though his successors were called marchio: [...] "margrave." ...|$|R
60|$|The Tailor stared and goggled and gaped {{to see so}} much smoke {{come out}} of such a little bottle, and, as he goggled and stared, the smoke began <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> <b>together</b> <b>again,</b> thicker and thicker, and darker and darker, until it was as black as ink. Then out from it there stepped one with eyes that shone like sparks of fire, and who had a countenance so terrible that the Tailor's skin quivered and shrivelled, and his tongue clove {{to the roof of}} his mouth at the sight of it.|$|R
6000|$|... "I am glad," [...] {{said the}} man in black, [...] "that my candor is not sinking me in the {{estimation}} of every one present; {{but even if it}} did, I am obliged to tell the truth. I do not know what would have become of me if I had not had the good-fortune to catch the measles from a family with whom I was spending Sunday in another town. As soon as the disease plainly showed itself upon me my school was broken up, and it was never <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> <b>again,</b> at least under me.|$|R
5000|$|According to the Wakan Sansai Zue {{written in}} the Edo Period, it was a blue light like a pine torchlight, and several onibi would <b>gather</b> <b>together,</b> and humans who come close would have their spirit sucked out. Also, from the {{illustration}} in the same Zue, it has been guessed to have a size from about 2 or 3 centimeters in diameter to about 20 or 30 centimeters, and to float in the air about 1 or 2 meters from the ground. According to Yasumori Negishi, in the essay [...] "Mimibukuro" [...] from the Edo period, in chapter 10 [...] "Onibi no Koto," [...] there was an anecdote about an onibi that appeared above Hakone mountain that split into two and flew around, <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> <b>again,</b> and furthermore split several times.|$|R
50|$|The {{band members}} came <b>together</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> perform in June 2013, at Electric Circus in Edinburgh, {{as part of}} a tribute night to the former venue Cas Rock.|$|R
60|$|Next {{in order}} was the sorrel. As I saw it, he heedlessly went too near the cow, {{which we now}} called Bossy, and she acted {{somewhat}} like a Spanish Bull, {{to the effect that}} the sorrel was scared and angered at once. He began to run and plunge and buck right into the other pack animals, dropping articles from his pack as he dashed along. He stampeded the train, and gave the saddle horses a scare. When order was restored and the whole outfit <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> <b>again</b> a full hour had been lost. By this time all the horses were tired, and that facilitated progress, because there were no more serious breaks.|$|R
50|$|On 1 January 1964, Bjørnskinn, Andenes, and Dverberg {{were all}} merged back <b>together</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> create the new {{municipality}} of Andøy. Before the merger, Dverberg had {{a population of}} 1,719.|$|R
60|$|Berruyer, on {{his arrival}} at Jallais, {{heard of the}} defeat of Leigonyer; and marched back in all haste to Chemille, where {{he had left his}} magazines. On hearing however that Leigonyer, on his arrival at Vihiers, had been deserted during the night by the whole of his troops and, finding himself in the morning with but a hundred and fifty men of the Finisterre regiment, had {{evacuated}} the town and retreated to Doug, Berruyer wrote to him to endeavour <b>to</b> <b>gather</b> his forces <b>together</b> <b>again,</b> and <b>to</b> return to Chemille.|$|R
5|$|While {{she tried}} to involve herself {{in the arts and}} {{sciences}} and distance herself from society protocols, she continued to feel the burden of her duties. Christmas 1877 provided respite for Alice, as all the family <b>gathered</b> <b>together</b> <b>again,</b> and she doted on her youngest daughters Alix and Marie. She was too exhausted to attend the wedding of her niece, Princess Charlotte of Prussia, in Berlin, in January 1878. In the Autumn of 1878, Queen Victoria paid for the Grand Ducal family to holiday in Eastbourne, where they stayed in a house on the Grand Parade. Alice performed various royal duties on this trip and visited her mother at Osborne before returning to the New Palace at Darmstadt in late 1878.|$|R
50|$|Artists such as David Hockney, Christopher Kates and Pep Ventosa have pioneered {{their own}} {{photographic}} mosaic techniques where multiple photographs are taken {{of a scene}} and then pieced <b>together</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> create a cohesive image.|$|R

60|$|She {{felt almost}} happy now, and, drawing the {{curtains}} closely <b>together</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> {{shut out the}} piercing sun, {{she went to bed}} at last, laid her head upon the pillow, and, like a wearied child, soon fell into a peaceful and dreamless sleep.|$|R

60|$|When {{they had}} <b>again</b> <b>gathered</b> {{themselves}} <b>together,</b> the shepherd, {{as the man}} who knew the country best, took the lead, and guided them round these treacherous inclines. The lanterns, which seemed rather to dazzle their eyes and warn the fugitive than to assist them in the exploration, were extinguished, due silence was observed; and in this more rational order they plunged into the vale. It was a grassy, briery, moist defile, affording some shelter to any person who had sought it; but the party perambulated it in vain, and ascended on the other side. Here they wandered apart, and after an interval closed <b>together</b> <b>again</b> <b>to</b> report progress.|$|R
