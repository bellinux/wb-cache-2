Our novel design allows for alternation between photoionization (PI) and EI within the same instrument on a timescale of minutes. Thus, the EI-based quantification capability of the AMS is retained while improved spectral interpretation is made possible by combined analysis of the complementary VUV and EI spectra.

Food wastes (corn, potatoes, and pasta) were converted to ethanol in a two-step process: a two-part enzymatic digestion of starch using alpha-amylase and glucoamylase and then fermentation of the resulting sugars to ethanol using yeast. Because of the low initial composition of starch in the food waste, low ethanol concentrations were achieved: at best 8 mg/ml ethanol (0. 8 % by mass).

Earthquakes may trigger gold precipitation by rapid loss of fluid pressure but their efficiency and time-integrated contribution to gold endowment are poorly constrained. In order to quantify the feedbacks between earthquake-driven fracturing and gold precipitation in the shallow crust, we studied the gold-rich fluids in the active Tolhuaca {{geothermal system}}, located in the highly seismic Southern Andes of Chile. We combined temperature measurements in the deep wells with fluid inclusion data, geochemical analyses of borehole fluids and numerical simulations of coupled heat and fluid flow to reconstruct the physical and chemical evolution of the hydrothermal reservoir. The effect of seismic perturbations on fluid parameters was constrained using a thermo-mechanical piston model that simulates the suction pump mechanism occurring in dilational jogs. Furthermore, we evaluated the impact of fluid parameters on gold precipitation by calculating the solubility of gold in pressure (P) - enthalpy (H) space. The reconstructed fluid conditions at Tolhuaca indicate that single-phase convective fluids feeding the hydrothermal reservoir reach the two-phase boundary with a high gold budget (1 - 5 ppb) at saturated liquid pressures between 20 and 100 bar (210 °C < Tsat < 310 °C). We show that if hydrothermal fluids reach this optimal threshold for gold precipitation at a temperature near 250 °C, small adiabatic pressure drops (10 bar) triggered by transient fault-rupture can produce precipitation of 95...|$|E

This paper focused on investigating the ignition and detonation-initiation performance of kerosene/air based on valveless air-breathing pulse detonation engines (PDEs) with inner diameters of 50 mm and 120 mm. Because of the poor detonability of kerosene/air mixture, a variety of devices and means were used to promote the detonation initiation. A <b>flash</b> <b>vaporization</b> system was designed and used to heat the kerosene and observed the effect of fuel temperature on ignition-detonation performance of PDE. And the centrifugal nozzle and twin-fluid air-assist atomizer were used to investigate the fuel droplet size effect on detonation-initiation performance. The results indicated that increasing ignition energy and fuel temperature was helpful for quick ignition and flame acceleration although detonation didn’t occur when the centrifugal nozzle was used. When air-assisted atomizer was used, detonation was initiated successfully no matter the fuel was heated or not. However, the ignition-detonation times of kerosene/air in air-breathing PDE at several operation frequencies were longer than that of gasoline/air respectively. As the operation frequency increased, the difference between the ignition-detonation times of kerosene/air and gasoline/air decreased. When the PDE inner diameter increased to 120 mm, detonation occurred much more difficultly. Detonation was not initiated until the ignition energy increased to 4 J and the mixing of kerosene and air was enhanced ulteriorly. And each of the ignition-detonation time at different operation frequency increased as the PDE inner diameter increased.

40|$|International audienceIn the {{volatile}} fuel price environment of today, {{the quest for}} alternative fuels has become a heavy and long term trend in power generation worldwide. Incorporating alternative fuels in gas turbine installations raises multiple engineering questions relating to combustion, emissions, on-base and auxiliary hardware capability, safety, etc. In 2008, GE carried out a field test aimed at characterizing the combustion of ethanol in a naphtha fuelled gas turbine plant. The testing strategy has been to locally prepare and burn ethanol-naphtha blends with a fraction of ethanol increasing from 0 % to nearly 100 %. During the engineering phase prior to this field test, it appeared necessary to develop a sufficient knowledge {{on the behavior of}} ethanol-hydrocarbon blends in order to establish the safety analysis and address in particular the risks of (i) potential uncontrolled ignition event in the air blanket of fuel tanks and (ii) <b>flash</b> <b>vaporization</b> of potential fuel pond in a confined environment. Although some results exist in the car engine literature for ethanol-gasoline blends, it was necessary {{to take into account the}} specificities of gas turbine applications, namely, (i) the much greater potential ethanol concentration range (from 0 % to 100 %) and (ii) the vast composition spectrum of naphtha likely to generate a much larger Reid vapor pressure envelope as compared with automotive applications. In order to fulfill the safety needs of this field test, the “Laboratoire de Thermodynamique des Milieux Polyphasés” of Nancy, France has developed a thermodynamic model to approach the vaporization equilibria of ethanol-hydrocarbons mixtures with variable ethanol strength and naphtha composition. This model, named PPR 78, is based on the 1978 Peng–Robinson equation of state and allows the estimation of the thermodynamic properties of a multicomponent mixture made of ethanol and naphtha compounds by using the group contribution concept. The saturation equilibrium partial pressure of such fluids in the various situations of relevance for the safety analysis can thus be calculated.

40|$|The Aerodyne aerosol mass {{spectrometer}} (AMS) is a frequently used instrument for on-line {{measurement of the}} ambient sub-micron aerosol composition. With the help of calibrations {{and a number of}} assumptions on the <b>flash</b> <b>vaporization</b> and electron impact ionization processes, this instrument provides robust quantitative information on various non-refractory ambient aerosol components. However, when measuring close to certain anthropogenic or marine sources of semi-refractory aerosols, several of these assumptions may not be met and measurement results might easily be incorrectly interpreted if not carefully analyzed for unique ions, isotope patterns, and potential slow vaporization associated with semi-refractory species. Here we discuss various aspects of the interaction of aerosol particles with the AMS tungsten vaporizer and the consequences for the measurement results: semi-refractory components – i. e., components that vaporize but do not flash-vaporize at the vaporizer and ionizer temperatures, like metal halides (e. g., chlorides, bromides or iodides of Al, Ba, Cd, Cu, Fe, Hg, K, Na, Pb, Sr, Zn) – can be measured semi-quantitatively despite their relatively slow vaporization from the vaporizer. Even though non-refractory components (e. g., NH 4 NO 3 or (NH 4) 2 SO 4) vaporize quickly, under certain conditions their differences in vaporization kinetics can result in undesired biases in ion collection efficiency in thresholded measurements. Chemical reactions with oxygen from the aerosol flow can have an influence on the mass spectra for certain components (e. g., organic species). Finally, chemical reactions of the aerosol with the vaporizer surface can result in additional signals in the mass spectra (e. g., WO 2 Cl 2 -related signals from particulate Cl) and in conditioning or contamination of the vaporizer, with potential memory effects influencing the mass spectra of subsequent measurements. Laboratory experiments that investigate these particle–vaporizer interactions are presented and are discussed together with field results, showing that measurements of typical continental or urban aerosols are not significantly affected, while measurements of semi-refractory aerosol in the laboratory, close to anthropogenic sources or in marine environments, can be biased by these effects...|$|E

The helium microwave-induced plasma (He-MIP) {{has been shown to be}} an excellent source for nonmetal determination. In this thesis, a description of the analytical characteristics of He-MIPs in different spectral regions using moderate and high power discharges for the determination of nonmetals is presented. Initial investigations using electrothermal vaporization (ETV) for sample introduction showed detection limits in the part-per-billion range for arsenic, selenium and antimony. Samples sizes were 15 μL. A tantalum-coated carbon cup was used to minimize interferences. The determination of metals, nonmetals and metalloids (F, Cl, Br, I, S, P, Se, As, Sb and Pb) in the vacuum ultraviolet (VUV) was accomplished. To observed atomic emission at wavelengths in the VUV region, a system which contained no N 2 and O 2 in the optical path was designed and implemented. This arrangement was produced by using an optical sampler to couple the plasma discharge with a helium purged monochromator. Sample introduction was accomplished with ultrasonic nebulization. Limits of detection, linear ranges, and matrix effects using groups IA and IIA elements were studied. Detection limits ranged from 0. 06 μg/mL for sulfur to 5 μg/mL for selenium. A study involving sulfur-containing compounds in the near infrared region (921. 3 nm) demonstrated the feasibility of the determination of inorganic and organic sulfur using differential electrothermal vaporization sample introduction. Detection limits were between 3 to 5 parts-per-million, and linear responses greater than two orders of magnitude were obtained. Sulfur detection limits were improved when a reductive pyrolysis of the sample was performed. The analyte was passed through a high temperature region (1050 ∘C) in the presence of hydrogen gas to form H 2 S. The resultant H 2 S was condensed in a liquid nitrogen trap. Following preconcentration, <b>flash</b> <b>vaporization</b> into the stream of flowing helium routed the H 2 S to the plasma for atomic emission detection. Results showed linear response and detection limits of 30 parts-per-billion when the 921. 3 nm sulfur emission line was monitored, and 400 parts-per-trillion when the resonant sulfur line at 180. 73 nm was observed...|$|E
