Navigational systems include EFIS 854 TF Electronic Flight Instrumentation System, which includes an Electronic Attitude Director Indicator (EADI) and <b>Electronic</b> <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator</b> (EHSI). Three new sensors have been installed for aircraft position and attitude control: an inertial reference unit (IRU), an attitude and heading reference unit (AHRU), and a global positioning system (GPS). A flight management system with two Gemini 10 computers and a new radio management system have also been installed.|$|E
40|$|Traffic {{symbology}} was encoded {{to provide}} additional information concerning the traffic, which was displayed on the pilot's <b>electronic</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicators</b> (EHSI). A research airplane representing an advanced operational environment {{was used to assess}} the benefit of coded traffic symbology in a realistic work-load environment. Traffic scenarios, involving both conflict-free and conflict situations, were employed. Subjective pilot commentary was obtained {{through the use of a}} questionnaire and extensive pilot debriefings. These results grouped conveniently under two categories: display factors and task performance. A major item under the display factor category was the problem of display clutter. The primary contributors to clutter were the use of large map-scale factors, the use of traffic data blocks, and the presentation of more than a few airplanes. In terms of task performance, the cockpit-displayed traffic information was found to provide excellent overall situation awareness. Additionally, mile separation prescribed during these tests...|$|R

40|$|Increases in {{the volume}} of air traffic around major terminals, {{as well as the}} advent of MLS and other {{sophisticated}} ATC techniques, have prompted the development of aircraft specifically optimized for flight in terminal areas. A modified Boeing 737, developed by NASA, is presented as an illustration of a Terminal Configured Vehicle (TCV). Among the TCV systems discussed are the electronic attitude direction indicator (EADI) and the <b>electronic</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (EHSI), both of which are advanced display systems capable of positioning the runway center line from a variety of glide slope paths, and with reference to time, i. e., the on-board computer can predict where the aircraft will be at a given number of seconds {{from the time of the}} analysis. Thus, 4 -D navigation (time path) can be selected as a control mode, together with vertical and horizontal path modes...|$|E
50|$|The Bendix/King KLN-90B {{controller}} {{is almost}} always linked to a GPS antenna, and may also include connections to other flight instruments such as an external Course Deviation <b>Indicator</b> (CDI) or <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (HSI), radio-magnetic indicator (RMI), fuel management system, air data system, ARTEX ELS-10 emergency locator transmitter (ELT), autopilot, and external annunciators.|$|R
5000|$|According to McDonnell Douglas, a {{short circuit}} or an open circuit in certain models of VOR/ILS {{receivers}} could cause navigation instruments to indicate [...] "zero deviation". Thus, raw data deviation {{information on the}} attitude direction indicator, displayed by the flight director bars, and the <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> could center and remain centered with no failure or warning flag in view.|$|R
50|$|These {{approaches}} {{include a}} localizer approach, localizer/DME approach, localizer back course approach, and a localizer-type directional aid (LDA). In cases where an ILS is installed, a back course {{may be available}} {{in conjunction with the}} localizer. Reverse sensing occurs on the back course using standard VOR equipment. With a <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (HSI) system, reverse sensing is eliminated if it is set appropriately to the front course.|$|R
40|$|It {{is pointed}} out {{that most of the}} modern flight {{simulators}} used for pilot training have included expensive motion bases, while the quantitative justification for motion is lacking. The present investigation is concerned with the effects of flight versus simulator conditions on scan behavior as a function of control mode and {{the presence or absence of}} traffic on the map display. Matching tests conducted in flight and in a fixed-base simulator permitted an evaluation of the differences in scanning behavior in the real world (flight) and in the 'less real' world (simulator). Scanning behavior in flight was found to be significantly different from the simulator. In flight, the dwell percentage increased on the Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator (EADI), and decreased on the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator</b> (EHSI). The average dwell time on all instruments decreased in flight...|$|E
40|$|Long straight-in and close-in, curved, {{descending}} instrument approaches {{were made}} in NASA's fixed-base Terminal Configured Vehicle simulator. The pilot either manually controlled the simulator or monitored the automatic system control of the simulated aircraft during the approach. Tests were performed {{with or without the}} display of traffic. The results indicate that the pilots' use of the <b>Electronic</b> <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator</b> (EHSI) increased appreciably for the close-in, curved, descending approach compared to the conventional straight-in approach. When operating as a monitor of the autopilot system, the pilot scanned around more with less attention devoted to the Electronic Attitude Direction Indicator (EADI). The pilots preferred the manual mode because it kept them in the control loop. The addition of displayed traffic to the EHSI increased the pilots' use of the EHSI with a corresponding reduction in his use of the EADI. Also, the pilot's pupil diameter increased during the landing flare indicating a higher stress level even though the tests were conducted in a fixed-base simulator...|$|E
40|$|Coded symbology, {{based on}} the results of early human factors studies, was {{displayed}} on the <b>electronic</b> <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> and flight tested on an advanced research aircraft in order to subject the coded traffic symbology to a realistic flight environment and to assess its value by means of a direct comparison with simple, uncoded traffic symbology. The tests consisted of 28 curved, decelerating approaches, flown by research-pilot flight crews. The traffic scenarios involved both conflict-free and blunder situations. Subjective pilot commentary was obtained through the use of a questionnaire and extensive pilot debriefing sessions. The results of these debriefing sessions group conveniently under either of two categories: display factors or task performance. A major item under the display factor category was the problem of display clutter. The primary contributors to clutter were the use of large map-scale factors, the use of traffic data blocks, and the presentation of more than a few aircraft.

500|$|The crew used Jeppesen charts dated 21 January 1994. According to procedures, both <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicators</b> (HSI) {{were set}} to 283°, but the {{magnetic}} localizer course of 300° was not set. A global positioning system (GPS) {{was used as a}} back-up. No requests were made for VHF direction finding. From [...] MSL until impact, the flight was carried out in instrument meteorological conditions (IMC) and the flight controlled by automatic stabilization mode, with lateral navigation controlled by the navigator.|$|R
50|$|The heading {{indicator}} (also {{known as the}} directional gyro, or DG) displays the aircraft's heading with respect to magnetic north when set with a compass. Bearing friction causes drift errors from precession, which must be periodically corrected by calibrating the instrument to the magnetic compass. In many advanced aircraft (including almost all jet aircraft), the {{heading indicator}} {{is replaced by a}} <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (HSI) which provides the same heading information, but also assists with navigation.|$|R
50|$|This {{instrument}} display {{can replace}} {{a magnetic compass}} display in the instrument panel, but not necessarily the gyroscopic Heading Indicator. The Heading Indicator can be combined with information from navigation radios (primarily VOR/ILS) in a similar way, to create the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator.</b> The HSI, along with the VOR system, has largely replaced use of the RMI, however the HSI's much higher cost keeps the older combination of an RMI and an Omni Bearing Indicator attractive to cost-conscious pilots.|$|R

50|$|An {{electronic}} {{flight instrument}} system (EFIS) is a flight deck instrument display system that displays flight data electronically rather than electromechanically. An EFIS normally {{consists of a}} primary flight display (PFD), multi-function display (MFD), and an engine indicating and crew alerting system (EICAS) display. Early EFIS models used cathode ray tube (CRT) displays, but liquid crystal displays (LCD) are now more common. The complex electromechanical attitude director <b>indicator</b> (ADI) and <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (HSI) were the first candidates for replacement by EFIS. Now, however, few flight deck instruments cannot be replaced by an electronic display.|$|R
50|$|A {{carrier and}} {{sideband}} (CSB), and sideband only (SBO) signal, transmitted from localizer and glidepath antennas produce a space-modulated signal {{resulting from the}} vectorial addition {{of two or more}} audio signals that vary according to position of the receiving aircraft.The difference between the two modulation depths produce an error current signal in the airborne receiver. When an aircraft follows the course line, {{the difference between the two}} frequencies is zero percent (0%).This difference is traditionally displayed by the deflection of a moving coil indicator or needle/s on an instrument known as a <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator,</b> HSI.|$|R
5000|$|A {{worldwide}} land-based {{network of}} [...] "air highways", {{known in the}} US as Victor airways (below 18000 ft) and [...] "jetways" [...] (at and above 18,000 feet), was set up linking VORs. An aircraft can follow a specific path from station to station by tuning into the successive stations on the VOR receiver, and then either following the desired course on a Radio Magnetic Indicator, or setting it on a Course Deviation Indicator (CDI) or a <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator</b> (HSI, a more sophisticated version of the VOR indicator) and keeping a course pointer centred on the display.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (commonly {{called the}} HSI) is an {{aircraft}} flight instrument normally mounted below the artificial horizon {{in place of}} a conventional heading indicator. It combines a heading indicator with a VHF omnidirectional range-instrument landing system (VOR-ILS) display. This reduces pilot workload by lessening the number of elements in the pilot's instrument scan to the six basic flight instruments. Among other advantages, the HSI offers freedom from the confusion of reverse sensing on an instrument landing system localizer back course approach. As long as the needle is set to the localizer front course, the instrument will indicate whether to fly left or right, in either direction of travel.|$|R
50|$|Honeywell’s Runway Awareness and Advisory System (RAAS) {{was first}} {{approved}} by the FAA in 2004. The basic RAAS system issues audible alerts based on an aircraft’s position {{on the ground in}} respect to runways. SmartRunway and SmartLanding are added to RAAS to add audible and text alert to the <b>horizontal</b> <b>situation</b> <b>indicator</b> (HSI) to indicate problems like a poor landing configuration or coming in too fast. In 2009 the FAA approved the first GPS-based ground navigation service with Honeywell’s Smartpath Landing System. Honeywell engineers are also developing an airport maps application that will display the plane’s position on a runway map, show other traffic and highlight taxi route issues by air traffic control.|$|R
50|$|Another {{method to}} {{intercept}} a VOR radial exists and more closely aligns {{itself with the}} operation of an HSI (<b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator).</b> The first three steps above are the same; tune, identify and twist. At this point, the VOR needle should be displaced to either the left or the right. Looking at the VOR indicator, {{the numbers on the}} same side as the needle will always be the headings needed to return the needle back to centre. The aircraft heading should then be turned to align itself with one of those shaded headings. If done properly, this method will never produce reverse sensing. Using this method will ensure quick understanding of how an HSI works as the HSI visually shows what we are mentally trying to do.|$|R
50|$|Advances in {{aviation}} during World War II {{led to the}} rapid post-war expansion of commercial and private aviation. Collins Radio quickly shifted from war-time projects to building communication equipment for the airlines and corporate fleets. A licensed pilot in his 20s, Arthur Collins led the pioneering development of the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator</b> (HSI) and other integrated flight instruments that combined in one display the pitch, roll, and yaw attitudes of the aircraft {{as well as its}} compass heading. Collins Radio became a world leader in avionics during the 1950s and 1960s. The 618T HF transceiver was a mainstay for the airlines and the ARC-27, with automatic tuning and 1750 channels, was the first practical UHF military transceiver, in service for over two decades.|$|R
5000|$|This theory, {{promoted}} by David Pearson {{in his book}} KAL 007: the Cover-up postulates that the pilots made [...] "a deliberate, carefully planned intrusion into Soviet territory {{with the knowledge of}} US military and intelligence agencies." [...] He argues that it was impossible for the pilots not to know that they were off course. Various mechanisms, such as the <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator,</b> should, assuming that the aircraft's navigation systems were functional and correctly programmed, have alerted the pilots of their course deviation. In addition, VHF transmissions to Anchorage had to be relayed via flight KAL 015 (which should have been a few minutes behind KAL 007, had it been on course), because the plane had travelled too far off course.|$|R
50|$|While First Officer Zille {{was making}} an {{external}} {{inspection of the}} aircraft, Captain Garcez consulted the flight plan for the magnetic heading to Belém; the flight plan read 0270. Garcez interpreted this as 270 degrees, but the intended meaning was 027.0 degrees. Varig's heading notation for the flight plan was changed to four digits from three while Garcez was on vacation, {{and it did not}} explicitly specify the position for the decimal point, which was implicitly located {{to the left of the}} rightmost digit. That confusion was the primary cause for the disaster, along with other minor errors. The captain therefore set the left-side <b>Horizontal</b> <b>Situation</b> <b>Indicator</b> (HSI) to 270 degrees, i.e. a due west course. This heading is clearly inconsistent with a route from Marabá to Belém.|$|R
