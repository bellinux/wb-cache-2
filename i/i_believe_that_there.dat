There were so few of them that I indeed cannot think of a single one south of the Thames when I became king. (Preface: [...] "Gregory the Great's Pastoral Care") ...|$|E
2500|$|He {{had many}} {{things about him}} which served to allure men to the {{gratification}} of their passions; he had also many things which acted as incentives to industry and toil. The vices of lust raged in him; {{but at the same}} time he was conspicuous for great energy and military skill.

2500|$|I {{can tell}} whether a piece is well-made or not, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> are {{conditions}} without which masterpieces cannot be achieved, but I {{also believe that}} what defines a masterpiece cannot be pinned down. I won't say that the criterion for a masterpiece does not exist, but I don't know what it is. She claimed to enjoy all [...] "good music". According to Lennox Berkeley, [...] "A good waltz has just as much value {{to her as a}} good fugue, and this is because she judges a work solely on its aesthetic content." [...] However, her taste has also been described as, [...] "to put it mildly, eclectic": [...] "She was an admirer of Debussy, and a disciple of Ravel. Although she bore little sympathy for Schoenberg and the Viennese dodecaphonicians, she was an ardent champion of Stravinsky".|$|E
2500|$|According to Yushchenko the {{difficulties}} of relations between Ukraine and Russia are because the countries follow different directions and have different system of values. Yushchenko thinks that [...] "the Russia-Georgia war of August 2008 poses a threat that European leaders still haven’t addressed". He {{has called for a}} demarcation of borders between Russia and Ukraine, which has been delayed by Russia since Ukraine won independence from the Soviet Union in 1991. During the campaign for the Ukrainian presidential election, 2010 Yushchenko said Russia's influence was again a factor in the upcoming election and warned of [...] "interference" [...] from Moscow in the distribution of Russian passports to residents of Crimea. He has also stated (on December 10, 2009) [...] "Russia is a friendly country {{and that it would be}} a great mistake for Ukraine to lose these relations or to slow down their development; <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> will appear politicians in Russia, who will respect the rights of all neighbors, including Ukraine".|$|E
2500|$|The {{surrender}} of Takenaga's unit {{was seen as}} an extremely dishonourable act by the Japanese Army. Upon learning of it, Lieutenant General Adachi strongly reprimanded the commanders of the 41st Division, and prayed to the emperor, while shedding tears, apologising for his lack of virtue. Even after the war, Takenaga was mostly considered a disgrace, and {{it was a long time}} before any light was shone on the Takenaga incident. While Takenaga's surrender was recorded in Dai Yonjūichi Nyū Ginia Sakusenshi (History of the 41st Division's New Guinea Operation), compiled by people associated with the 41st Division, and in Senshi Sōsho, a military history of the Pacific War published by the Japanese Defense Agency, there were also histories that recorded the event as though Takenaga's unit had been wiped out. Awareness of the incident gradually increased after the publication of Fumio Takahashi's article in 1986, but even as of 2009 there were still military personnel who denied that the surrender occurred. For example, in an interview for NHK, Masao Horie, who was a staff officer for the 18th Army and a major at the time of the incident, said, [...] "Up until now I have never heard of anything like a surrender, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> were no soldiers who surrendered. If it's true that there was a commander who surrendered, then it is a shame." ...|$|E

40|$|Motivated by {{the desire}} both to explore Palestinian {{schooling}} practices during the past century and to learn about some educational innovations, I carried out a small research project entitled “The History of Mathematics education in Palestine,” which {{was supported by the}} Scientific Research Committee at Birzeit University. Given the paucity of documentation of the educational system in Palestine, <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>there</b> would be significant historical value in understanding how Palestinians have been learning (and teaching) mathematics over time...|$|R

Quick, however, had a different opinion. He said that he had seen two men in this state before from the concussion caused by the bursting of large shells near to them, and that they both recovered although one of them became an idiot.|$|R
