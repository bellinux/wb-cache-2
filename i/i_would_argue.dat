25|$|The Torah's {{story of}} {{creation}} {{is not intended}} as a scientific treatise, worthy of equal time with Darwin's theory of evolution in the curriculum of our public schools. The notes it strikes in its sparse and majestic narrative offer us an orientation to the Torah's entire religious worldview and value system. Creation is taken up first not because the subject has chronological priority but rather to ground basic religious beliefs in {{the very nature of}} things. And <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that their power is quite independent of the scientific context in which they were first enunciated.|$|E

500|$|Atherton sued CHSRA {{again in}} December 2016, stating that using bond money {{intended}} for high-speed rail for CalMod was a material change in usage and therefore was unconstitutional because {{such a change}} would require voter approval first. In response, the California legislature allowed the funding to be redirected by passing Assembly Bill No. 1889, which had been championed by Assemblymember Kevin Mullin in 2015. Mullin noted [...] "this entire Caltrain corridor is {{the epicenter of the}} innovation economy and it's a job creation and economic engine.

It's a devastating end to a beloved character, but <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> with anyone who said it wasn't a fitting end."

500|$|The Flames {{struggled}} in 2009–10, failing {{to qualify for}} the playoffs {{for the first time since}} 2003. Iginla accepted responsibility for the team's failure, admitting that finishing around 70points for the season was [...] "not enough". The Flames' declining fortunes and Iginla's season led to increasing questions on whether he could be traded from the team with whom he has played his entire NHL career. Iginla, who would have to approve any trade the team attempts to make due to a no-movement clause in his contract, expressed that he did not wish to leave Calgary, but would accommodate a trade if the Flames wished to do so. Former Flames' general manager Craig Button argued against trading Iginla, blaming a lack of complementary players for both Iginla and Calgary's failures: [...] "There's nothing easier in hockey than to be able to shut down one player. And the Calgary Flames, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue,</b> have made it really easy for teams to shut down Jarome." [...] The Flames publicly stated that they had no plans to trade him.|$|E

[...] Norris echoed the sentiments of TLC's Lisa Lopes, who told MTV that it's because of Mariah that we have [...] "Hip-Pop." [...] Judnick Mayard, writer of TheFader, wrote that in regarding of R and hip hop collaboration, [...] "The champion of this movement is Mariah Carey." [...] Mayard also expressed that [...] "To this day ODB and Mariah may still be the best and most random hip hop collaboration of all time", citing that due to the record [...] "Fantasy," [...] "R and Hip Hop were the best of step siblings." [...] In the 1998 film Rush Hour, Soo Yong is singing the song while it plays on the car radio, shortly before her kidnapping.

Abrams hinted that because of the alternate timeline created in the first film, reintroducing Khan into Star Trek lore remained a possibility. Abrams told MTV, [...] " [...] exist—and while their history may not be exactly as people are familiar with, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that a person's character is what it is," [...] Abrams said of the notion that his Khan could be just as evil, even if Kirk never stranded him on Ceti Alpha V. [...] "Certain people are destined to cross paths and come together, and Khan is out there... even if he doesn't have the same issues." [...] Writer Damon Lindelof declared that Khan's [...] "intense gravity," [...] particularly regarding the character's delivery of monologues, made him an obligatory character to use, even if its iconic status made the crew afraid of the fan reaction. Lindelof jokingly stated that [...] "it was never really a 'Should we or shouldn't we?' as much as it was 'We really have to do this but if we don't get it right people are going to kill us.'" ...|$|E
500|$|One {{of their}} most notable episodes was [...] "Homer's Enemy", an episode {{designed}} to [...] "push the envelope conceptually." [...] The idea for [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] was first conceived by Oakley, who thought that Homer should have an enemy. This evolved into {{the concept of a}} [...] "real world" [...] co-worker who would either love or hate Homer. The writers chose the latter as they thought it would have funnier results. The result was the character of Frank Grimes, a man who has had to work hard all his life with nothing to show for it and is dismayed and embittered by Homer's success and comfort in spite of his inherent laziness and ignorance. [...] "Homer's Enemy" [...] explores the comic possibilities of a realistic character with a strong work ethic placed alongside Homer in a work environment. In the episode, Homer is portrayed as an everyman and the embodiment of the American spirit; in some scenes, his negative characteristics and silliness are prominently highlighted. By the close of the episode, Grimes, a hard working and persevering [...] "real American hero," [...] is relegated to the role of antagonist; the viewer is intended to be pleased that Homer has emerged victorious.

Although, <b>I</b> <b>would</b> <b>argue</b> that in 'Homer's Enemy' he's not even really even all that excessively stupid or immature, actually." [...] Weinstein said: [...] "We wanted to do an episode where the thinking was 'What if a real life, normal person had to enter Homer's universe and deal with him?' I know this episode is controversial and divisive, but I just love it. It really feels like what would happen if a real, somewhat humorless human had to deal with Homer. There was some talk [...] about the ending—we just did that because (a) it’s really funny and shocking, (2) we like the lesson of 'sometimes, you just can't win'—the whole Frank Grimes episode is a study in frustration and hence Homer has the last laugh and (3) we wanted to show that in real life, being Homer Simpson could be really dangerous and life threatening, as Frank Grimes sadly learned." [...] When the episode was first broadcast, many fans felt it was too dark, unfunny and that Homer was portrayed as overly bad-mannered. On the DVD commentary, Weinstein considers this episode one of the most controversial of the seasons he ran, as it involves sharp observational humor which many fans [...] "didn't get." [...] Weinstein talks about a [...] "generation gap"—the episode was originally panned by viewers, but has since become a favorite among fans who grew up with the show.|$|E
