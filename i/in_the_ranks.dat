5|$|In September 1914, Lord Kitchener {{announced}} that he was looking for volunteers and regular NCOs to provide officers for the expanding army. Most of the volunteers came from the middle class, with the largest group from commercial and clerical occupations (27%), followed by teachers and students (18%) and professional men (15%). In March 1915, it was discovered that 12,290 men serving <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> had been members of a university or public school Officers' Training Corps (OTC). Most applied for and were granted commissions, while others who did not apply were also commissioned. Direct commissioning largely ceased early in 1916, from then most new officers had served <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> first, even if in a unit of potential officers.|$|E

5|$|An {{indication}} of the army's high esteem for barbarian-born troops is that {{they appear to have}} been preferentially recruited to the elite units of the late imperial era's armies. In the auxilia palatina infantry regiments, the proportion of barbarians <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> appears to have numbered anywhere between a third and a half of effectives (compared to a quarter in the army as a whole). From the late 3rd century onwards, barbarian recruitment became crucial to the army's continued existence, by providing a much-needed source of first-rate recruits.|$|E

5|$|Ultimately {{the revolutionary}} {{excesses of the}} period would prove {{disastrous}} for the French Navy. Poor leadership, conflicting and arbitrary orders and the decimation of the experienced seamen <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> promoted a negative attitude in the French officer corps. The French battlefleet did not contest British dominance in Northern European waters again, and their raiding operations repeatedly ended in failure {{at the hands of}} more confident British squadrons and the unforgiving Atlantic weather. By 1805, when the last great French fleet to take to the sea was crushed at the Battle of Trafalgar, poor training and low investment in the Navy had reduced its efficiency to levels unthinkable 20years earlier.|$|E
5|$|A {{month after}} the Spanish Civil War began in 1936, several players from Barcelona enlisted <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>ranks</b> of those who fought against the {{military}} uprising, along with players from Athletic Bilbao. On 6 August, Falangist soldiers near Guadarrama murdered club president Josep Sunyol, {{a representative of the}} pro-independence political party. He was dubbed the martyr of barcelonisme, and his murder was a defining moment in the history of FC Barcelona and Catalan identity. In the summer of 1937, the squad was on tour in Mexico and the United States, where it was received as an ambassador of the Second Spanish Republic. The tour led to the financial security of the club, but also resulted in half of the team seeking asylum in Mexico and France, making it harder for the remaining team to contest for trophies.|$|E
