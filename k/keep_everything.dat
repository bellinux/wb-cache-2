5|$|And by {{the time}} they got it all {{organized}} and figured out, there were really only a couple of songs left for me to do anything on. So I came into L.A. for a couple of days and Kasim... came in, as was the routine, and we did maybe three songs... just so that I’d have a few fingerprints on the record. I think someone, maybe Meat Loaf, said that to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> covered, I had to be in there somewhere... but not necessarily running the whole thing. So my involvement was pretty much peripheral.|$|E
25|$|Centenary Test {{match between}} Australia and England at the Melbourne Cricket Ground in March 1977, {{about two dozen}} players had {{committed}} to Packer's enterprise, which as yet had no grounds to play on, no administration and was secret to all in the cricket world. It was {{a measure of the}} players' dissatisfaction with official cricket that they were prepared to sign up for what was still a vague concept and yet <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> covert.|$|E
25|$|Survival {{opportunities}} open to {{the larger}} Soviet community included bartering and farming on private land. Black markets thrived as private barter and trade became more common, especially between soldiers and civilians. Soldiers, who had more food to spare, were eager to trade with Soviet citizens that had extra warm clothes to trade. Planting vegetable gardens in the spring became popular, primarily because citizens got to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> grown on their own plots. The campaign also had a potent psychological effect and boosted morale, a survival component almost as crucial as bread.|$|E

25|$|In {{cases where}} no reuse is {{possible}} or desired, urine is usually infiltrated {{in the soil}} unless this practice would cause groundwater pollution. In eThekwini municipality in South Africa or in Lima, Peru, for example, urine from UDDTs is safely infiltrated into the soil because the groundwater level is very low there and the groundwater is not used for any particular purpose. Infiltration {{can be done by}} directing the urine to a soak pit or by running a perforated urine pipe from the toilet to an area outside, where the hose is sloping gently downhill (for rural areas). Clogging of the pipe's holes can be avoided by ensuring there are no T-junctions, no joints and that a plastic mesh is installed in the urine funnel of the toilet to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> other than urine out.|$|E
25|$|Both Art and Horace were very, {{very aware}} of {{what they wanted to}} do. They wanted {{to get away from the}} jazz scene of the early '50s, which was the Birdland scene—you hire Phil Woods or Charlie Parker or J. J. Johnson, they come and sit in with the house rhythm section, and they only play blues and {{standards}} that everybody knows. There's no rehearsal, there's no thought given to the audience. Both Horace and Art knew that the only way to get the jazz audience back and make it bigger than ever was to really make music that was memorable and planned, where you consider the audience and <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> short. They really liked digging into blues and gospel, things with universal appeal. So they put together what was to be called the Jazz Messengers.|$|E

Determined to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> for the dwarves, he sends a raven to his cousin Dáin, asking for support. Meanwhile, he tasks Bilbo with finding the Arkenstone, a treasure of great importance. Bilbo does so, but sneaks out of the mountain with it, and, {{in an effort to}} prevent the upcoming battle, gives it to Bard and Thranduil, who are leading the army of men and elves. They offer to return the Arkenstone to Thorin if he gives them their treasures, but he refuses, denouncing Bilbo as a traitor. The next day, Dáin's army arrives, and a battle seems unavoidable. However, before the conflict begins, Gandalf appears, revealing the imminent arrival of an army of goblins and wargs, led by Bolg. Thorin agrees to join with Bard and Thranduil as the Battle of the Five Armies begins.|$|E

[...] Hillenburg had a [...] "clear vision" [...] of what he wanted the show to look like.

The idea for the series was [...] "to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> nautical", so the crew used a great amount of rope, wooden planks, ships' wheels, netting, anchors, boilerplates, and rivets in creating the show's setting. Bubbles filing up the screen is also a nautical technique used to transition from scene to scene.|$|E
500|$|Much of the game's {{criticism}} {{stemmed from}} its substitution of mostly unrelated quests over a main storyline. GamePro, while praising the Land Make system, {{found that the}} [...] "focus of Legend of Mana is obscured by the over-abundance of subplots". Similarly, Game Revolution's Johnny Liu commented that the game lacked depth and felt like {{a collection of short}} quests rather than a single game, while Vestal of GameSpot noted that the game's use of miniquests will likely disappoint those seeking an action-RPG classic, and said that, although fun, the gameplay had a [...] "schizophrenic and disjointed nature". Next Generation agreed, saying that the Land Make system was an [...] "innovative feature" [...] but that it left the game disjointed without a solid plot to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> together. The Japanese Weekly Famitsu reviewers felt that the system was ambitious, but left the game feeling disconnected, and that the divided plotlines kept the beginning of the game from having the charm of the end.|$|E
500|$|... "Part of Me" [...] is a dance-pop {{and power}} pop song set {{to a house}} beat. It is {{composed}} in the key of D minor and set in a 4/4 time signature at a tempo of 130 beats per minute. The melody spans the tonal range of D4 to D5, while the music follows the chord progression of Dm–F–Bb-C. Production was done by Perry's frequent collaborator, Dr. Luke. The song begins with Perry's somber and emotional delivery of the line, [...] "Days like this I want to drive away/ Pack my bags and watch your shadow fade." [...] At the bridge, the beat amplifies and Perry's lyrics become more aggressive as she commands [...] "Now Look at Me!", signalling to her ex that she is still strong, regardless of what he tries to do to bring her down. The beat reaches a peak at the chorus, and Perry's tone and the song's lyrics become more aggressive and prominent as she sings, [...] "This is the Part of me that you're never gonna ever take away from me." [...] As the song continues, Perry's lyrics become strong and empowered: [...] "So {{you can keep the}} diamond ring/ It don't mean nothing anyway/ In fact you can <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> Yeah/ Yeah Except for me". Perry repeats the ending chorus as the beat fades.|$|E

500|$|P.T.s ceaselessly looping hallway {{has been}} a source of {{critical}} discussion. Rob Crossley of GameSpot wrote that it induced [...] "mild claustrophobia" [...] and [...] "a familiarity with your surroundings". He remarked that while the length of the first part of the corridor worked to create tension, the design of the second part intentionally prevented the player from being able to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> in view, causing the player to feel vulnerable. David Houghton of GamesRadar described the looping corridor as [...] "the conduit for everything that it builds", along with saying that [...] "it fills that structure with an unbroken feedback loop of 'horror' ... every time you leave is a monumental relief, and every simultaneous instance of returning is a moment of primal foreboding at how things might, and almost certainly will, escalate, compounded by the knowledge of the seemingly countless iterations before." [...] Houghton felt that the game understood how to evoke horror by working [...] "within the realm of psychology". Polygon quoted a game player who said that [...] "P.T.s greatest asset is its looping hallway", elaborating that it not only invokes fear, but also [...] "curiosity, or a desire to know what will happen next". Matulef said that the claustrophobic and repetitive environment displayed in the game can hypnotize the player into a sense of vulnerability.|$|E
500|$|Research {{was a major}} {{component}} of the developmental stages of Murder on the Orient Express. Most of the research was focused on Yugoslavia in 1934, the game's setting. Sheldon focused on the political and scientific situation of this era, and explained his intensive research, saying [...] "all of the puzzles have to be contextual. They all have to either help character, help story or define period." [...] The developers also drew influence from a train museum outside Miami with an original Pullman carriage - the same as the carriages used on the Orient Express in the 1930s. The museum also contained a locomotive similar to the one the developers were looking for. The developers ended up using the train museum, several books about the Orient Express, the 1974 film version of Christie's novel, and the internet as research resources. With Murder on the Orient Express being the first Poirot game produced, Sheldon was careful that the game fitted into Christie's timeline of Poirot's exploits. The television series often took liberties with the time in which stories were set, but Sheldon was determined to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> in strict accordance with Christie's work. There are several references in the game to Poirot's earlier cases, all of which are chronologically accurate. This was partly so that Sheldon could use the culture of specific eras of time, and also so that in the future other Poirot-based games will be chronologically accurate.|$|E
500|$|Following {{the release}} of Jessica Jones, David Priest at net wrote about how the series rescues [...] "Marvel from itself ... Jessica Jones takes big steps forward in terms of theme, craft and diversity. It's a good story first, and a superhero show second. And for the first time, the MCU seems like it matters. Our culture needs stories like this. Here's hoping Marvel keeps them coming." [...] For Paul Tassi and Erik Kain of Forbes, {{watching}} the series made them question the MCU, with Kain feeling that the [...] "morally complex, violent, dark world of Jessica Jones {{has no place in}} the MCU ... right now, the MCU is holding back shows like Jessica Jones and Daredevil, while those shows are contributing absolutely nothing to the MCU." [...] Tassi {{went so far as to}} wonder what [...] "the point of the Marvel Cinematic Universe" [...] is, lamenting the lack of major crossovers in the franchise since the Winter Soldier reveal on Agents of S.H.I.E.L.D., and saying that Jessica Jones is [...] "so far removed from the world of The Avengers, it might as well not be in the same universe at all ... really don't understand the point of [...] if they're going to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> within it separated off in these little boxes". Conversely, Eric Francisco of Inverse called Jessica Joness lack of overt connections to the MCU [...] "the show's chief advantage. Besides demonstrating how physically wide open the MCU's scope really is, Jessica Jones also proves the MCU's thematic durability." ...|$|E

2500|$|Hisbah ( [...] ḥisb(ah), or hisba) is a {{historic}} Islamic doctrine which means [...] "accountability". Hisbah doctrine holds {{that it is a}} religious obligation of every Muslim that he or she report to the ruler (Sultan, government authorities) any wrong behavior of a neighbor or relative that violates sharia or insults Islam. The doctrine states that it is the divinely sanctioned duty of the ruler to intervene when such charges are made, and coercively [...] "command right and forbid wrong" [...] in order to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> in order according to sharia.

2500|$|Lancashire was {{initially}} unavailable to portray Caroline in the series, due to {{starring in the}} original West End production Betty Blue Eyes. However, due to the musical closing early Lancashire became available to film the series. Lancashire discerned that the series was [...] "very special" [...] within reading two pages of the script. Other factors that persuaded her to commit to the series included the casting of Anne Reid and Derek Jacobi as the series' protagonists, and the juxtaposition of a heart-warming story with elements of humour. In terms of her character, Lancashire identified with Caroline being [...] "a working woman trying to <b>keep</b> <b>everything</b> under control". She stated the series' ensemble cast was [...] "the closest I’ve come to being in a theatre company on television" [...] due to how well the actors worked together.|$|E
