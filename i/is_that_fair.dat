Lenglen, however, described {{her decision}} as [...] "an escape from bondage and slavery" [...] and said in the tour programme, [...] "In the twelve years I have been champion I have earned literally millions of francs for tennis and have paid thousands of francs in entrance fees {{to be allowed to}} do so.... I have worked as hard at my career as any man or woman has worked at any career. And in my whole lifetime I have not earned $5,000 – not one cent of that by my specialty, my life study – tennis.... I am twenty-seven and not wealthy – should I embark on any other career and leave the one for which I have what people call genius? [...] Or should I smile at the prospect of actual poverty and continue to earn a fortune – for whom?" [...] As for the amateur tennis system, Lenglen said, [...] "Under these absurd and antiquated amateur rulings, only a wealthy person can compete, {{and the fact of the}} matter is that only wealthy people do compete. <b>Is</b> <b>that</b> <b>fair?</b> [...] Does it advance the sport?

If you tap my claret first, there are five guineas for you, and I’ll go with you to any squire you choose to mention.

The negroes may {{thoroughly}} identify themselves with England, claim {{a share in}} her greatness, and display abundant lip-loyalty; yet there is the racial aversion to Englishmen in the concrete, and {{to this is added}} the natural jealousy of seeing strangers monopolise the best appointments. The Sá Leonite openly declares that he and his can rule the land much better and more economically than the sickly foreigner, who spends half his service-time on board the steamers and at home. 'Dere goes another white raskel to his grave!' they will exclaim {{at the sight of a}} funeral. 'Wish dey all go and leave colony to US.'

We can hardly blame them. I have shown that the worst and most scandalous display of journalism comes from London.|$|E

"'Little {{men have}} a decided {{inclination}} for big women, and [...] vice versâ; and indeed in a little man the preference for [...] big women will be so much the more passionate if he himself [...] was begotten by a big father, and only remains little through [...] the influence of his mother; because he has inherited from his [...] father the vascular system and its energy which was able to [...] supply a large body with blood. If, on the other hand, his [...] father and grandfather were both little, that inclination will [...] make itself less felt. At {{the foundation of the}} aversion of a [...] big woman to big men lies the intention of Nature to avoid [...] too big a race.... Further, the consideration as to the [...] complexion is very decided. Blondes prefer dark persons or [...] brunettes; but the latter seldom prefer the former. The [...] reason <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>fair</b> hair and blue eyes are in themselves a [...] variation from the type, almost an abnormity, analogous to [...] white mice, or at least to grey horses. In no part of the [...] world, not even {{in the vicinity of the}} Pole, are they [...] indigenous, except in Europe, and are clearly of Scandinavian [...] origin. I may here express my opinion in passing that the [...] white colour of the skin is not natural to man, but that by [...] nature he has a black or brown skin, like our forefathers the [...] Hindus; that consequently a white man has never originally [...] sprung from the womb of Nature, and that thus there is no such [...] thing as a white race, much as this is talked of, but every [...] white man is a faded or bleached one. Forced into this strange [...] world, where he only exists like an exotic plant, and like [...] this requires in winter the hothouse, in the course of [...] thousands of years man became white. The gipsies, an Indian [...] race which immigrated only about four centuries ago, show the [...] transition from the complexion of the Hindu to our own. [...] Therefore in sexual love Nature strives to return to dark [...] hair and brown eyes as the primitive type; but the white [...] colour of the skin has become second nature, though not so [...] that the brown of the Hindu repels us. Finally, each one also [...] seeks in the particular parts of the body the corrective of [...] his own defects and aberrations, and does so the more [...] decidedly the more important the part is. Therefore [...] snub-nosed individuals have an inexpressible liking for [...] hook-noses, parrot-faces; and it is the same with regard to [...] all other parts. Men with excessively slim, long bodies and [...] limbs can find beauty in a body which is even beyond measure [...] stumpy and short.... Whoever is himself in some respects very [...] perfect does not indeed seek and love imperfection in this [...] respect, but is yet more easily reconciled to it than others; [...] because he himself insures the children against great [...] imperfection of this part. For example, whoever is himself [...] very white will not object to a yellow complexion; but whoever [...] has the latter will find dazzling whiteness divinely [...] beautiful.' (You will note that he perceives he has [...] practically contradicted this a few lines before, and that [...] evidently he has gone back and stuck in that saving clause [...] about a white skin being second nature.) 'The rare case in [...] which a man falls in love with a decidedly ugly woman occurs [...] when, beside the exact harmony of the degree of sex explained [...] above, the whole of her abnormities are precisely the [...] opposite, and thus the corrective, of his. The love is then [...] wont to reach a high degree....' ...|$|E

5000|$|One {{reason for}} low prices <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>fair</b> trade imposes an inefficient {{marketing}} system. Farmers {{are forced to}} sell through a monopsonist cooperative, which may be inefficient or corrupt - certainly some private traders are more efficient than some cooperatives. They cannot choose the buyer who offers the best price, or switch when their cooperative is going bankrupt. There are also complaints that fair trade deviates from the free market ideal of some economists.

50|$|Fair dealing {{is to be}} {{examined}} on a case-by-case basis. The purpose of the dealing, character of the dealing, amount of the dealing, alternatives of the dealing, {{nature of the work}} and effect of the dealing are factors that can contribute to fair dealing. Those favouring a broad interpretation of fair dealing argue there ought to be reasonable unauthorized reproduction of works because it facilitates creativity and free expression. They also argue that fair dealing provides reasonable access to existing knowledge. Those arguing that fair dealing ought to be more restrictive and specific state that fair dealing will reduce revenue to those creating works. They also argue the reproduction of works and sends a wrong message to the public that works are free as long as it falls under this banner. Their economic argument <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>fair</b> dealing should not compensate for the market's inability to meet the demand for public knowledge.|$|E

50|$|A common {{criticism}} <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>fair</b> trade {{helps the}} rich {{rather than the}} poorest farmers. Fair trade is profitable for traders in rich countries.It is also aimed at richer farmers. In order to join fair trade, cooperatives must meet quality and political standards which means their farmers must be relatively skilful, educated and well capitalized, and critics point out that these farmers are, therefore, far from the poorest farmers. The majority of fair tradesuppliers are in the higher income or middle income Third World countries, such as Costa Rica and Mexico, with relatively few in the poorest countries. Mexico has 70 times the GNP per head of Sierra Leone. The minimum wage of agricultural workers in Peru is $3 a day and the average income of Fairtrade farmers in Bolivia was US$900/year, very much higher than normal agricultural incomes in Africa and much of Asia. Again, critics say this is diverting money from the poorest farmers.|$|E

50|$|Under IRC § 1014(a), which {{applies to}} an asset {{that a person}} (the beneficiary) {{receives}} from a giver (the benefactor) after the benefactor dies, the general rule is that the beneficiary's basis equals the fair {{market value of the}} asset at the time the benefactor dies. This can result in a stepped-up basis or a stepped-down basis. An example of a stepped-up basis: If Benefactor owned a home that Benefactor purchased for $35,000, then Benefactor's basis in the home would be equal to its purchase price, $35,000, assuming no adjustments under IRC § 1016, which allows for increases in basis such as home improvements, or decreases in basis such as unrepaired windstorm damage. Continuing the example, the fair market value of Benefactor's home was $100,000 on the day Benefactor died. After Beneficiary inherits the home from Benefactor, Beneficiary's basis in the home <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>fair</b> market value, $100,000. In contrast, if Benefactor gives the home to Beneficiary before Benefactor dies, then Beneficiary receives a carryover basis, which is equal to the Beneficiary's purchase price for the home, $35,000, again assuming no adjustments under IRC § 1016.|$|E

The second major idea is based on the close scrutiny of the electoral maps, not only in 2009 but also in 2005 and the years in between. The result is baffling: not only Ahmadinejad's victory was incomprehensible in light of these data but Mousavi's score was also highly unlikely because the two other candidates' votes were disproportionately minored in order to bring about a two-pronged electoral result that nothing seemed to justify, taking into account previous elections, presidential, municipal and parliamentarian...|$|E
