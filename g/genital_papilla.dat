25|$|Sexual {{dimorphism}} {{has been}} reported in Acrochordonichthys. Males have the anus situated immediately in front of a <b>genital</b> <b>papilla,</b> which is located posterior to the pelvic fin base. The genital opening is situated {{at the tip of the}} papilla, covered by a fleshy flap. In females, the anus is situated more posteriorly and the genital opening is located at the tip of a short genital appendage. In A. ischnosoma, males have a long <b>genital</b> <b>papilla</b> located immediately posterior to anus, while females have a conical <b>genital</b> <b>papilla</b> located immediately posterior to anus.|$|E

25|$|The mimicry of egg-spots is {{utilized}} by males for the fertilization process. Mouthbrooding females lay eggs and immediately snatch {{them up with}} their mouths. Over millions of years, male cichlids have evolved egg-spots to initiate the fertilization process more efficiently. When the females are snatching up the eggs into their mouth, the males gyrate their anal fins, which illuminates the egg-spots on his tail. Afterwards, the female, believing these are her eggs, places her mouth to the anal fin (specifically the <b>genital</b> <b>papilla)</b> of the male, which is when he discharges sperm into her mouth and fertilizes the eggs.|$|E

25|$|A. guttatus {{is easily}} {{differentiated}} from {{other members of}} the A. ischnosoma group by a slender (vs. moderately thick) humeral process (maximum width 10.011.8% its length vs. 13.218.4). A. mahakamensis is differentiated from other members of its group by a rounded (vs. angular) anterior margin of the anal fin, and a more slender body. A. septentrionalis can be differentiated by members of the A. ischnoma group by a smaller dorsal to adipose distance (4.45.7% standard length vs. 6.29.8), fewer branchiostegal rays (4 vs. 56) and an almost uniformly cream colour pattern with few very small brown spots (vs. a variegated colour pattern with numerous brown patches). A. strigosus can be differentiated from members of the A. ischnosoma species group by a rounded (vs. angular) posterior margin of the adipose fin and a more slender body; the <b>genital</b> <b>papilla</b> in male A. strigosus is also morphologically different from other members of its species group (short and thick vs. long and thin). A. ischnosoma is distinguished from {{other members of the}} A. ischnosoma group by a greater distance between the dorsal fin and adipose fin (9.010.1% SL vs. 4.48.7) and a greater exposure of the premaxillary teeth when the mouth is closed (one-third vs. less than one-fifth to none). A. gyrinus can be distinguished from its congeners by a concave posterior margin of the pectoral fin.|$|E

40|$|Recent inferences of {{phylogeny}} from molecular characters, {{as well as}} a {{reexamination of}} morphological and biological characters, reject the monophyly of the nematode genus Koerneria Meyl, 1960 (Diplogastridae). Here, Koerneria sensu lato is revised. The genus, which previously consisted of 40 species, is separated into three genera. Almost all of the transferred species are moved to the resurrected genus Allodiplogaster Paramonov & Sobolev in Skrjabin et al. (1954). Koerneria and Allodiplogaster are distinguished from each other by a weakly vs. clearly striated body surface, an undivided vs. divided stomatal cheilostom, and arrangement of the terminal ventral triplet of male <b>genital</b> <b>papillae,</b> namely in that v 5 and v 6 are paired and separated from v 7 vs. v 5 –v 7 being close to each other. Allodiplogaster is further divided into two groups of species, herein called the henrichae and striata groups, based on both morphological and life-history traits. The henrichae group is characterized by papilliform labial sensilla and male <b>genital</b> <b>papillae,</b> a conical tail in both males and females, and an association with terrestrial habitats and insects, whereas the striata group is characterized by setiform labial sensilla and male <b>genital</b> <b>papillae,</b> an elongated conical tail in both sexes, and an association with aquatic habitats. A second genus, Anchidiplogaster Paramonov, 1952, is resurrected to include a single species that is characterized by its miniscule stoma and teeth, unreflexed testis, and a distinct lack of male <b>genital</b> <b>papillae</b> or stomatal apodemes. Lastly, one further species that was previously included in Koerneria sensu lato is transferred to the genus Pristionchus Kreis, 1932. The revision of Koerneria sensu lato is necessitated by the great variability in its subordinate taxa, which occupy a variety of habitats, in addition to the increased attention to Diplogastridae as a model system for comparative mechanistic biology...|$|R

40|$|SEM {{observations}} of the external morphology of populations of Radopholus citrophilus and R. similis revealed several diagnostic differences.

Females of R. citrophilus had four annules {{in the region of}} the vulval opening, but R. similis had five annules in the same region. The labial disc and lateral lips appeared to be of diagnostic significance, but these areas were more susceptible to artifacts due to fixation. An unknown population of Radopholus from Puerto Rico with a chromosome number of n = 4 was morphologically similar to R. similis. These morphological differences provide additional support that R. citrophilus and R. similis are distinct species...|$|R

40|$|The {{scanning}} {{electron microscope}} (SEM) {{has been a major}} tool in detailed morphological observations of plant parasitic nematodes during the last 30 years, efficiently complementing light microscopical (LM) studies. Nematodes are extremely difficult to observe and characterize due to their small size (aprox. 1 mm long) and paucity of morphological characters, so detailed surface observations of several organs and nematode regions are of the highest value. Among plant parasitic nematodes, one of the most devastating species is the “pinewood nematode” (PWN), Bursaphelenchus xylophilus, which has been a major problem for forest species, and in particular pines, in Asia (Japan, China, Korea) and has been recently detected in the European Union (Portugal). B. xylophilus belongs to a closely related, morphologically similar group of species, within the genus Bursaphelenchus, and designated by the “xylophilus group”. SEM has become a crucial tool in observing several genital characters of males and females, such as male <b>genital</b> <b>papillae,</b> male copulatory spicules, female vulval flap and female <b>genital</b> <b>papillae.</b> s In this presentation, we will show how SEM has been utilized to observe and characterize the shape of the vulval flap, the presence/ absence of papillae near the flap, and confirm the presence and the arrangement of the male <b>genital</b> <b>papillae.</b> LM is also used in this work to show its value as a complementary tool to SEM, in both genital characteristics and other, general, characters of the genus Bursaphelenchus, such as the male bursa and cephalic region...|$|R
