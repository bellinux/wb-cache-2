40|$|Abstract. GSM’s {{encryption}} {{function for}} call and SMS privacy, A 5 / 1, {{can be broken}} in seconds with 2 TB of fast storage and two graphics cards. The attack combines several time-memory trade-off techniques and exploits the relatively small effective key size of 61 bits. GSM Basics Scope. <b>GSM</b> <b>telephony</b> is the world’s most popular communication technology spanning most countries and connecting over four billion devices. Besides telephony, GSM is used for text messaging, Internet browsing and device-to-device communication. The standards for voice and text messaging date back to 1990 and have never been overhauled. In particular, vulnerabilities in GSM’s original security design have never been patched. Data capabilities other than SMS messages were later added and use different security measures, which are not covered in this briefing. Encryption. Phone calls and text messages can be encrypted between a phone and a base station. The base station decides whether encryption is used. Operators {{in the developed world}} typically use the original A 5 / 1 encryption function, while a number of operators in the developing world do not use any encryption.

The {{research}} of the effects of electromagnetic fields (EMFs) of different frequencies on its functioning have been carried out for years. This paper presents the results of the scientific literature review on the EMF influence on the functioning of the human nervous system with a particular emphasis on the recent studies of the modern wireless communication and data transmission systems. In the majority of the analyzed areas the published research results do not show EMF effects on the nervous system, except for the influence of <b>GSM</b> <b>telephony</b> signal on resting EEG and EEG during patients’ sleep and the influence of radiofrequency EMF on the cardiovascular regulation. In other analyzed areas (EMF impact on sleep, the evoked potentials and cognitive processes), there are no consistent results supporting any influence of electromagnetic fields. Neurophysiological studies of the effect of radio- and microwaves on the brain functions in humans are still considered inconclusive. This is among others due to, different exposure conditions, a large number of variables tested, deficiencies in repeatability of research and statistical uncertainties. However, methodological guidelines are already available giving a chance of unifying research that definitely needs to be continued in order to identify biophysical mechanisms of interaction between EMFs and the nervous system. One of the EMF research aspects, on which more and more attention is paid, are inter-individual differences. Med Pr 2016; 67 (3) : 411 – 42...|$|E

40|$|Nowadays, most {{mobile phones}} are {{equipped}} with multiple wireless access technologies, which allow the user to maintain connections while moving across networks (e. g. having a telephony service in GSM while moving to a WLAN area). The IEEE 802. 21 Media Independent Handover (MIH) Services is a standard aiming at facilitating handover between these heterogeneous networks. In the current situation, {{in order for the}} mobile device to detect other wireless access network (e. g. WLAN), the user has to keep the WLAN interface continuously on and this will cause battery drain. With IEEE 802. 21, the mobile device will have continuous access to the MIH function via a Service Access Point (SAP) on the GSM network and can hence receive information about the availability of the WLAN hot spot. The WLAN interface can then be turned on and the connection can be established. Unfortunately, the standard only provides the information for network connectivity but is incapable of supporting service continuity. More specifically, the standard does not enable the user to seamlessly change from <b>GSM</b> <b>telephony</b> to IP telephony when entering a WLAN hotspot. To remedy the situation this thesis has analysed future mobile scenarios and proposes a mobile service architecture, which enhances the availability of services {{at the same time as}} service continuity is ensured. The necessary functional entities both on the network and terminal side are identified and described. The thesis has also conducted thorough analysis and realisation of the two main elements of the mobile service architecture, namely Service Continuity and Service Discovery. To realise Service Continuity it is proposed to extend the functionality of the IEEE Media Independent Handover (MIH). More specifically, it is proposed to extend the information database with service information and to include service information in the information exchange between the mobile client and the MIH. Regarding Service Discovery it is an innovative discovery scheme capable of handling the following characteristics: Similar services with different names in different languages Different services with similar names Partially similar services No restriction regarding the name length Anybody can introduce anything as a service anytime To verify the validation of the three proposed items: The future mobile service architecture The Service Continuity The Service Discovery partial but sufficient implementations have been carried out. Consequently, it is possible to conclude that the three proposed items are both sound and feasible. PhD i telematikkPhD in Telematic...|$|E

40|$|In {{the summer}} of 2013, the Nigerian military, {{as part of its}} {{counterinsurgency}} operations against Boko Haram insurgents, shut down <b>GSM</b> mobile <b>telephony</b> in three northeast states – Adamawa, Borno and Yobe.

It draws on focus group discussions with local opinion leaders and in-depth personal interviews with military and security insiders, as well as data of Boko Haram incidences before, during and after the blackout from military sources and conflict databases. It argues that, although the mobile phone shutdown was ‘successful’ from a military- tactical point of view, it angered citizens and engendered negative opinions toward the state and new emergency policies. While citizens developed various coping and circumventing strategies, Boko Haram evolved from an open network model of insurgency to a closed centralized system, shifting the center of its operations to the Sambisa Forest. This fundamentally changed the dynamics of the conflict. The shutdown demonstrated, among others, that while ICTs serve various desirable purposes for developing states, they will be jettisoned when their use challenges the state’s legitimacy and raison d'être, but not without consequences...|$|R

New techniques of generating the Gaussian pulse responses of good precision are approached, proposed and researched in this paper. The second and third order derivatives with regard to the Gaussian pulse response are accurately generated. The third order derivates is composed of four individual rectangular pulses of fixed amplitudes, being easily to be generated by standard techniques. In order to generate pulses able to satisfy the spectral mask requirements, an adequate filter is necessary to be applied.

This means that the wire-tap encoder can indeed provide an information theoretical security level over a period of time, but after a large enough sample is collected the function tends to zero, entering a regime in which a computational security analysis is needed for estimation of the resistance against the secret key recovery...|$|R

40|$|With the popularization of <b>GSM</b> mobile <b>telephony</b> {{now days}} a great {{majority}} of people use their mobile telephones while they are in vehicles. This assumption {{is the basis of}} tracking vehicles through GSM mobile telephones of the users. The idea is a collaboration of mobile telecommunications technology and traffic engineering. To analyze the idea we have to understand how the GSM network works, know its architecture and know the potencial usability of gained information in traffic planning. There are many ways of determining the position of mobile telephone that differ in the accuracy of positioning and difficulty of implementation in the GSM network. The manager of the GSM network is the service provider and is operating with all data that is necessary to maintain its functionality. Responsibility of the service provider is guarantee of anonymity that is defined in the law about personal data protection. Tracking of GSM phone users is possible only with their approval. As s proof of functionality a one week tracking of five candidates was executed. They were using a GPS method of tracking and they were recording all journeys they made during that time period. A few characteristic journeys made with GPS tracking were tracked with a method of cell identification. Additional mobile telephone software applications were used to obtain the tracking and capture the recorded data on mobile telephones of users. GPS tracking was executed with Nokia Sports Tracker. Tracking with cell identification method was executed with CellPos 1. 43. For the survey of the gained data a geographical information program Google Earth was used.

The arising {{and development}} of the Internet made a revolutionary change to communication and interchange of information. Bluetooth wireless technology revolutionizes personal connectivity by providing freedom from wired connections. Combining these technologies together brings the concept of Mobile@Home of Ericsson. Mobile@Home is a fixed-mobile convergence concept using the fixed network to carry present and future mobile services (e. g. voice, video, mail and Internet access) {{all the way to the}} home or office. By combining the high bandwidth of the fixed access network with the wireless technology of Bluetooth, Mobile@Home makes it possible to deliver high bandwidth to the mobile phone. Mobile@Home requires a Bluetooth enabled mobile phone and a Bluetooth enabled HBS (Home Base Station), placed at the home or office. By means of fast IP access (ADSL, cable modem etc.) the HBS connects into the standard mobile core network through a HBSC (Home Base Station Controller). The purpose of this thesis is the generation of simulated traffic between the HBS and HBSC and to analyze its behavior. This primary involves generation of signaling through an internal protocol, provided by Ericsson, for management and call control, and generation of GSM EFR (Enhanced Full Rate) voice streams over the RTP (Real Time Protocol) protocol. The simulation will consist of both the HBS and MS (Mobile Station). A set of HBS: s with attached MS will call one another through the HBSC.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 33). This report intends to investigate the practices of People Quality Management {{in the context of}} GrameenPhone (GP), the leading <b>GSM</b> mobile <b>telephony</b> system in Bangladesh. This report includes all the functions regarding the recruitment, selection and training procedures that helps to find an eligible employee who is best matched for the operations that are conducted in the customer service. Implementation of different management tools are found here. GrameenPhone Ltd (GP) is a fast growing mobile telecommunication. Considering the importance of customer satisfaction, it is very much important to hire and train those candidates who will be giving the services to the customers or the subscribers. So it is a big responsibility to choose the best candidates among the thousands of applicants for the job. It is generally recognized that, although GrameenPhone is leading the market of mobile telecommunication industry, its customer’s are not fully satisfied with their services. Study shows Telecom Industry may lose consumers due to poor Customer Service. So it is undoubtedly important to satisfy the customers with the services and the people who’ll be delivering those services must have the knowledge of the services, sense of satisfying the customers within the company’s process of delivery. Without the good sense and know-how to produce the correct forms of customer service, customers opting to use a company’s products may not want to invest their time and money into a product where they don’t feel completely appreciated and welcomed. So it is a crucial responsibility of the HR people of the customer service division to recruit the best quality managers and provide them training accordingly. In the recruitment process PQM is following only two step process of selection. They are taking voice test which is the first stage and the second step is taking interview of the selected candidates. If candidate passes in both the process they become selected for the job and then send for training for a month. But within two steps of recruitment sometimes candidates are not properly judged or can’t be exemplified by their KSO’s thus the knowledge, skill or attitudes. So there must have some more steps in the recruitment and selection procedures. Some more defined and structured steps can help to identify the most qualified among so many candidates. If GP PQM does not make proper recruitment and selection procedure then they might end up with a bad experience regarding the customer’s experience of getting services from unskilled work force. Thus if other company enters the market with similar offers, it will be difficult for GrameenPhone to keep current market share intact. Tanzila Hashem KhushbuB. Business Administratio...|$|R
