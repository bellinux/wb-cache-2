50|$|Both {{the first}} and second floors {{originally}} housed thirty-four Arkwright water frames which spun 4236 ends simultaneously. This meant that 4236 rovings were continuously twisted together to become threads that were collected on small bobbins. Later mule spinning machines were introduced to produce finer thread types which were in demand. The bobbins were sent to the fifth floor.On the fifth floor, reeling frames wound the spun thread into 'skeins' ready for dyeing at a factory in Milford. <b>Doubling</b> <b>frames</b> <b>twisted</b> two or more single spun thread together to make thicker and stronger thread. The amount of twist imparted determined the thread's properties.|$|R

40|$|We {{present a}} lattice Boltzmann {{algorithm}} {{to solve the}} Beris-Edwards equations of motion for a cholesteric liquid crystal. We use our algorithm to investigate permeative flow. We find that, for helices pinned at the boundary, a small body force leads to a huge viscosity increase whereas larger ones induce no increase. This shear thinning is in agreement with experiments. If instead, the helix lies perpendicular to the plates, {{there is almost no}} viscosity increase. For strong forcing, we identify a flow-induced <b>double</b> <b>twist</b> in the director field. We compare this texture with the static <b>double</b> <b>twist</b> of cubic blue phases...|$|R

50|$|On July 25, at the U.S. Secret Classic, {{competing}} on a recently-injured ankle, Skinner finished 7th in the all-around with a {{score of}} 55.500. On beam, she had a fall on her back-handspring tuck full series. She had a stable routine {{the rest of the}} way and scored a 12.800, placing 12th on the event. On floor exercise, one of her best events, she threw in her Moors (<b>double</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>double</b> layout) and her Silivas (<b>double</b> <b>twisting</b> <b>double</b> tuck), but she watered down her last two tumbling passes to protect her ankle from further injury. She fell on her double tuck and scored a low 13.500 from a 6.3 start value, placing 9th on the event. She scored a 15.100 on her Cheng vault and a 14.800 on her double-twisting Yurchenko, for an average of 14.950 and placed second. She ended on bars with a more difficult routine and scored a respectable 14.100, placing her 10th.|$|R
