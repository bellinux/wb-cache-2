5|$|A February 2000 {{story about}} organic {{vegetables}} on 20/20 included statements by Stossel that tests {{had shown that}} neither organic nor conventional produce samples contained any pesticide residue, and that organic food {{was more likely to}} be contaminated by E. coli bacteria. The Environmental Working Group objected to his report, mainly questioning his statements about bacteria, but also managed to determine that the produce had never been tested for pesticides. They communicated this to Stossel, but after the story's producer backed Stossel's statement that the test results had been as described, the story was rebroadcast months later, unchanged, and with a postscript in which Stossel reiterated his claim. Later, after a report in The New York Times confirmed the Environmental Working Group's claims, ABC News suspended the producer of the segment for a month and reprimanded Stossel. Stossel apologized, saying that he had thought the tests had been conducted as reported. However, he asserted that the <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> his report had been accurate.|$|E
5|$|At {{that time}} Wiśniowiecki also {{engaged in a}} {{political}} conflict over nobility titles, in particular, the title of prince (kniaź). The nobility in the Commonwealth was officially equal, and used different and non-hereditary titles than those found in {{rest of the world}} (see officials of the Polish-Lithuanian Commonwealth); the <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> the conflict, which took much of the Sejm's time around 1638–41, revolved around whether old prince titles (awarded to families before their lands were incorporated into the Commonwealth in the 1569 Union of Lublin), and the new titles, awarded more recently by some foreign courts, should be recognized. Wiśniowiecki was one of the chief participants in this debate, successfully defending the old titles, including that of his own family, and succeeding in abolishing the new titles, which gained him the enmity of another powerful magnate, Jerzy Ossoliński. Other than this conflict, in his years as a deputy (1635–46), Jeremi wasn't involved in any major political issues, and only twice (in 1640 and 1642) he served in the minor function of a commissar for investigating the eastern and southern border disputes.|$|E

The <b>gist</b> <b>of</b> Baer's argument: in addition to Chase's own sources and ideas, some characters, settings, and storylines portrayed in The Sopranos were allegedly inspired by tours and conversations the series creator had with Tony Spirito ("a restaurateur and admitted gambler who says he often did 'favors' such as chauffeuring for wiseguys he had known all his life. His old pals included reputed notorious figure John 'Uncle Johnny' Riggi and Louis 'Fat Lou' LaRasso, a late underboss of the DeCavalcante crime family"), Thomas Koczur (a homicide detective for the Elizabeth Police Department), and people Spirito and Koczur introduced Chase to, in addition to communications and input provided by Baer, who'd introduced Chase to Spirito and Koczur in the first place.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Gastrointestinal stromal tumors (<b>GISTs)</b> <b>of</b> the {{duodenum}} {{are rare}} neoplasms. The optimal surgical procedure is debated and several options ranging from limited resections to pancreaticoduodenectomy have been reported.

We report the case of a localized duodenal GIST that was successfully treated by totally laparoscopic pancreas-preserving subtotal duodenectomy.

30|$|A {{previous}} study {{failed to find}} any correlation between TERT promoter mutations and clinicopathological factors in GISTs (Campanella et al. 2015); however, {{we found that the}} ALT phenotype was significantly associated with extra-gastric tumor origin. Furthermore, although telomere dysregulation was not associated with adverse outcomes in GISTs, {{it should be noted that}} telomere dysregulation was frequently observed in patients with <b>GISTs</b> <b>of</b> non-gastric origin, who have a worse overall survival rate compared to those with gastric <b>GISTs.</b> <b>GISTs</b> <b>of</b> non-gastric origin have commonly a poorer prognosis than those of gastric origin (Joensuu et al. 2012; Miettinen and Lasota 2006). Therefore, these findings suggest that a poorer prognosis <b>of</b> non-gastric <b>GISTs</b> might be affected by telomere dysfunction. Although we found that telomere dysregulation did not have a prognostic impact in <b>GISTs</b> <b>of</b> non-gastric origin (data not shown), some previous studies demonstrated the associations between telomerase activity and malignant or metastatic potential in GISTs by TRAP analysis (Sakurai et al. 1998; Kawai et al. 2005; Wang and Kou 2007). Regarding to our two TERT promoter mutated cases, one case was classified as low-risk and the other case as high-risk. Unfortunately, we cannot examine telomerase activity for those two cases because of lack of frozen section. To affirm association between telomerase activity and TERT promoter mutations in GIST, larger studies with frozen materials are required.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} reports the {{diagnostic}} utility of endoscopic ultrasound-guided fine needle aspiration (EUS-FNAC) in two patients affected by gastrointestinal stromal tumours (<b>GISTs)</b> <b>of</b> the stomach.

The crucial aim <b>of</b> <b>GIST</b> management is to determine a correct diagnosis in early-phase disease in order to realize an adequate curative surgical resection before the tumour becomes unresectable or metastatic.

30|$|In conclusion, TERT {{promoter}} mutations {{were rare}} in Japanese GISTs, {{similar to what}} has been previously shown in a European study (Campanella et al. 2015).

These findings suggest that telomere maintenance by telomerase activation and ALT might not {{play an important role in}} tumor progression <b>of</b> <b>GISTs.</b> However, much larger number of cases by multicenter studies are required to conclude the frequency of telomere dysregulation and its prognostic impacts in GISTs.|$|R

This is full access of the fight or flight mechanism all people have functioning in the brain, but based on what triggers this mechanism will lead to better recall of it.

MethodsRetrospective review from January 1999 to August 2011 of patients with primary <b>GISTs</b> <b>of</b> the duodenum. ResultsForty-one patients underwent resection <b>of</b> duodenal <b>GISTs.</b> All operations were performed with intent to cure with negative margins of resection. The most common location of origin was the second portion of the duodenum. Local excision (n= 19), segmental resection with primary anastomosis (n= 11) and a pancreatoduodenectomy (n= 11) were performed. Two patients underwent an ampullectomy with local excision. Peri-operative mortality and overall morbidity were 0 and 12, respectively. Patients with high-risk GISTs (P= 0. 008) and those who underwent a pancreatoduodenectomy (P= 0. 021) were at a greater risk for morbidity. The median follow-up was 18 months. Eight patients developed recurrence. High-risk GISTs and neoplasms with ulceration had the greatest risk for recurrence (P= 0. 017, P= 0. 029 respectively). The actuarial 3 - and 5 -year survivals were 85 % and 74 %, respectively.
