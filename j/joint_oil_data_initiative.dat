In 2005, the effort was renamed JODI, joined by the International Energy Forum (IEF), and covered more than 90% of the global oil market. The Gas Exporting Countries Forum (GECF) joined as an eighth partner in 2014, enabling JODI also to cover nearly 90% of the global market for natural gas.|$|R

From June 20 to 24, 2005, Gambian President Yahya Jammeh, made a state visit to the Philippines and had bilateral talks with the Philippine President Gloria Macapagal Arroyo. President Jammeh expressed support and advocated for the Philippines bid to the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation (OIC). The Gambian president also proposed to Arroyo a <b>joint</b> <b>oil</b> exploration following the recent discovery of oil in his country. Jammeh offered one block out of the five oil deposits in the Gambia to the Philippines to be developed in the proposed <b>joint</b> <b>oil</b> exploration. The Philippines agreed to conduct a <b>joint</b> <b>oil</b> exploration with the Gambia. The agreement {{was said to be}} the fruits of the New Asian-African Strategic Partnership signed by both countries in Jakarta. The Philippine National Oil Company subsequently said that the first 5 blocks offered did not show much potential, but that they were interested in the sixth block.|$|R

30|$|One {{of the few}} {{solutions}} {{suggested to}} Iran to prevent this wasteful migration was for both countries to start operating the <b>joint</b> <b>oil</b> fields simultaneously (Mehr News 2010). But even this solution will probably {{not be able to}} resolve the issue completely. If there are several operators for a <b>joint</b> <b>oil</b> field, each would try to reach the highest production rate of oil in the shortest time possible. Under such circumstances, since the main focus is on maximizing production, the maintenance of the oil field and production optimization would at least be partly disregarded. Such a policy would damage the entire field {{to the point where the}} interests of all the parties are harmed (Mehr News 2010). In January 2011, the two countries announced that in order to increase their crude output, they have reached an agreement to develop <b>joint</b> <b>oil</b> fields on border areas (Press TV News 2012 b). If they both exploit the fields with an equal and reasonable extraction rate which is less than the maximum rate possible, the conditions of the fields are monitored more accurately; thus, the long-term benefits of proper maintenance of the fields exceed the revenue losses from extracting less than maximum.|$|R

Our key conclusions are that 1) the criticality of the factors depends considerably on the context of the open data initiative; 2) a number of success factors appear to be more universally applicable than others; 3) the factors that are critical to all three cases are derived from many different success factor categories, which suggests that open <b>data</b> <b>initiatives</b> should adopt an interdisciplinary approach, and 4) further work is needed to detail the success factors for open data publication and use in other contexts.

40|$|The thesis {{tried to}} {{understand}} how renowned open <b>data</b> <b>initiatives</b> work, and give an attempt to investigate the relations between actors in an open data ecosystem. This was with ambitions to understand managerial approaches open <b>data</b> <b>initiatives</b> have adopted, to {{develop an understanding of}} actions and relations; where, how and whom initiatives support and facilitate. This is understandably of concern as not all open <b>data</b> <b>initiatives</b> reach a point where they have managed to bring about valuable impacts. The underlying assumption here is {{that it is difficult to}} visualise where and how open data can be beneficial, as such governmental open <b>data</b> <b>initiatives</b> remain stagnant with a limited understanding of strategies to adopt. The method of approach has been semi-structured interviews with international governmental open data officials. The findings suggest that open data management remarkably consist of approaches that are user-orientated and aim for governmental data management capacities. These two measures combined can instigate greater interaction between data users and publishers, which subsequently uncovers degrees of uncertainty and aids in building an open and digital system. Furthermore, the initiatives focus heavily on building awareness and consequently demonstrating value. It is crucial for open <b>data</b> <b>initiatives</b> to build momentum in activities through informing, teaching and engaging data users and publishers. Their end target is to demonstrate value for both sharing and using data. Certain risk is still inherent in opening up data, with that it is recommended to start small and safe - to build on small projects, observe outcomes, and then take directions.  open data initiative; ecosystem; complex; uncertainty; stagnant; change management; simple order-generating rul...|$|R
