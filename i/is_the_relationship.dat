5|$|Another topic <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between brain {{structures}} and language acquisition. Research in first language acquisition has already established that infants from all linguistic environments go through similar and predictable stages (such as babbling), and some neurolinguistics research {{attempts to find}} correlations between stages of language development and stages of brain development, while other research investigates the physical changes (known as neuroplasticity) that the brain undergoes during second language acquisition, when adults learn a new language.|$|E
5|$|Relationships among lemur {{families}} have also {{proven to be}} problematic and {{have yet to be}} definitively resolved. To further complicate the issue, several Paleogene fossil primates from outside Madagascar, such as Bugtilemur, have been classified as lemurs. However, scientific consensus does not accept these assignments based on genetic evidence, and therefore it is generally accepted that the Malagasy primates are monophyletic. Another area of contention <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between the sportive lemurs and the extinct koala lemurs (Megaladapidae). Formerly grouped in the same family due to similarities in dentition, they are no longer considered to be closely related due to genetic studies.|$|E

5|$|When Seymour later arrives {{that morning}} {{suffering}} a toothache, Mushnick sends Seymour to Dr. Farb, {{who tries to}} remove several of his teeth without anesthetic to get even with Seymour for ruining Farb's flowers. Grabbing a sharp tool, Seymour fights back and accidentally stabs and kills Farb. Seymour is horrified that he has now murdered twice, and after posing as a dentist to avoid the suspicion of Farb's masochistic patient Wilbur Force, Seymour feeds Farb's body to Audrey Jr. The unexplained disappearances {{of the two men}} attract the attention of the police and Mushnick finds himself questioned by Sergeant Joe Fink and his assistant Officer Frank Stoolie (take-offs of Dragnet characters Joe Friday and Frank Smith,). Although Mushnick acts suspiciously nervous, Fink and Stoolie conclude that he knows nothing.

25|$|Another {{source of}} {{controversy}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between smoking and sensory gating in schizophrenia.

However, research shows this effect alone cannot account for increased smoking rates.|$|E

Vorian tells Abulurd the truth behind Xavier Harkonnen’s death, {{and how it}} was Iblis Ginjo who betrayed humanity and not Xavier. Abulurd changes his last name back to Harkonnen, which is reviled by most in the League. Though this bogs down Abulurd’s military career, Vorian still manages to promote him to Segundo in the Army of the Jihad, and finally Bashar in the Army of Humanity. Together they vow to win the war against the thinking machines, and once this goal is met, to clear the name of Xavier Harkonnen.|$|E
25|$|Phaedrus {{believes}} {{that one of}} the greatest goods given <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between lover and boy. This relationship brings guidance and love into the boy’s life. Because the boy has a lover as such a valuable role model, he is on his best behavior to not get caught in something shameful. To get caught in something shameful would be like letting down his lover, therefore the boy is consistently acting his best. The absence of shame makes room for a sense of pride to come in; pride from the wealthy feeling of impressing one's own lover. Impressing one's own lover brings more learning and guidance into the boy's life.|$|E
25|$|Dynamic Causal Modeling (DCM) is a Bayesian {{method for}} deducing the {{structure}} of a neural system based on the observed hemodynamic (fMRI) or electrophysiologic (EEG/MEG) signal. The first step is to make a prediction as to the relationships between the brain regions of interest, and formulate a system of ordinary differential equations describing the causal relationship between them, although many parameters (and relationships) will be initially unknown. Using previous results on how neural activity is known to translate into fMRI or EEG signals, one can take the measured signal and determine the likelihood that model parameters have particular values. The elucidated model can then be used to predict relationships between the considered brain regions under different conditions. A key factor to consider during the design of neuroimaging experiments involving DCM <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>relationship</b> between the timing of tasks or stimuli presented to the subject and the ability of DCM to determine the underlying relationships between brain regions, which is partially determined by the temporal resolution of the imaging modality in use.|$|E
