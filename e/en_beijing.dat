En la Tercera Conferencia de la Mujer celebrada en Nairobi en 1985 se reconoció la discriminación de este sexo en la vida económica, política y social, lo que se considera como un hecho natural.

Gender {{emerges from}} a process of social {{construction}} that defines what is masculine and what is feminine {{on the basis of}} biological sexes to the extent of setting the positions of power between them. National political agendas and international bodies have addressed the unfavorable situation of women with respect to men caused by inequalities to which females have been subjected to throughout the history. In the Third Conference on Woman held in Nairobi in 1985, discrimination of females in the economic, political and social contexts was recognized, which is considered as a natural event. The Fourth Conference on Woman held in Beijing in 1995 discussed gender equity and woman empowerment, both accepted as a milestone for the planning of health policies and population programs. The UN General Assembly session held from June to July, 1999 in New York City called upon the scientific community to focus its efforts on the design and use of indicators capable of measuring the real health situation in general and the reproductive health in particular, paying special attention to gender approach.

This {{will serve as}} a case study to elucidate certain aspects of the role played by Jesuit medicine, i. e. Jesuit physicians and Jesuit drugs, at the court of the Kangxi emperor (r. 1662 - 1722), the first of the three great rulers of the Qing dynasty (1644 - 1911). As a first step the network of power, as reflected in the so-called medical palace memorials, will be presented in order to arrive at a more comprehensive evaluation of the medical involvement of the Jesuits, as practising physicians, suppliers of foreign drugs and as patients. It will be shown that the circumstances of Thomas’ illness and death must be based on a political and social analysis of the role of court medicine as patronised by the Kangxi emperor. Secondly, the case study of Antoine Thomas will also allow us to reflect on the delocalisation and appropriation of theriac at the Chinese court - one of the foreign drugs in the supply of which Jesuits might have been participated. Last but not least, I shall introduce a number of references in archival documents which throw some additional light on Thomas’ illness and death, and how they were perceived and dealt with in the imperial court. En el presente artículo me centro en la enfermedad y muerte de Antoine Thomas (28 de Julio, 1709) <b>en</b> <b>Beijing.</b> Lo cual servirá como estudio para aclarar ciertos aspectos del papel jugado por la medicina Jesuita, es decir, médicos Jesuitas y medicinas Jesuitas en la corte del emperador Kangxi (r. 1662 - 1722), el primero de los tres grandes emperadores de la dinastía Qing (1644 - 1911). Primero se presentará la red de poder, según se ve reflejada en los llamados memoriales de palacio de medicina, para poder llegar a una evaluación más profunda de la involucración médica de los Jesuitas, como médicos practicantes, proveedores de medicamentos extranjeros y como pacientes. Se demostrará que las circunstancias de la enfermedad y muerte de Thomas han de basarse en un análisis político y social del papel de la medicina de corte promovida por el emperador Kangxi. En segundo lugar, el estudio sobre Antoine Thomas también nos permitirá reflexionar sobre la deslocalización y apropiación de la teriaca en la corte china - uno de los medicamentos extranjeros en cuyo suministro posiblemente participaran los Jesuitas. Para terminar, presentaré numerosas referencias en documentos de archivo que arrojarán algo más de luz sobre la enfermedad y muerte de Thomas, y cómo fueron percibidas y tratadas en la corte imperial...|$|E

EN 1914 LA ACUPUNTURA FUE PROHIBIDA EN CHINA POR EL GOBIERNO NACIONALISTA Y PERMANECIO ASI DURANTE MUCHOS ANOS 55. A PARTIR DE 1930 SE DESARROLLA UNA CAMPANA A ESCALA NACIONAL CON EL PROPOSITO DE REESTRUCTURAR LA MTCH USANDO LA METODOLOGIA CIENTIFICA. UNO DE LOS GRANDES REPRESENTANTES DE ESTE MOVIMIENTO FUE LU YUANLEI, QUIEN ENFATIZABA QUE PARA PODER ESTABLECER UN PUENTE VERDADERO DE COMUNICACION ENTRE LA MEDICINA OCCIDENTAL Y LA MTCH ERA NECESARIO TENER UN GRAN DOMINIO DE LA CIENCIA, DEL METODO CIENTIFICO Y DE CULTURA MEDICA TANTO DE LA TRADICIONAL CHINA COMO DE LA OCCIDENTAL 53.

ASI, LA LEGITIMIDAD IDEOLOGICA DE LA ACUPUNTURA SE RESTABLECIO Y SE REINCORPORO COMO PARTE DEL SISTEMA DE SALUD PUBLICA DE CHINA. LA ACUPUNTURA ES TAMBIEN UNA PARTE INTEGRAL DE LOS SISTEMAS DE SALUD PUBLICA EN MUCHAS OTRAS NACIONES ASIATICAS ORIENTALES INCLUYENDO EL JAPON, COREA Y VIETNAM 55. LA MAYOR INFLUENCIA PARA EL DESARROLLO DE LA ACUPUNTURA EN EUROPA EN EL SIGLO XX FUE EL TRABAJO DE GEORGE SOULIE DE MORANT, DIPLOMATICO FRANCES ESTABLECIDO EN CHINA DE 1901 A 1917, QUIEN PUBLICO ARTICULOS Y TRADUCCIONES FRANCESAS DE TEXTOS MEDICOS CHINOS Y JAPONESES E INTRODUJO LA TEORIA DE LA ACUPUNTURA DESDE LOS TEXTOS CLASICOS A LA COMUNIDAD MEDICA DE FRANCIA Y EUROPA, COMUNMENTE USANDO LOS TERMINOS DE CANALES Y ENERGIA, AMBOS ORIGINADOS EN SUS TEXTOS COMO TRADUCCIONES PARA LOS DOS PRINCIPIOS FUNDAMENTALES DE LA ACUPUNTURA: LA ANATOMIA Y FISIOLOGIA 21.

40|$|Abstract: In this study, to give {{insight into}} the {{bacterial}} diversity of biofilms from full-scale drinking water distribution sys-tems (DWDSs), the bacterial community compositions of biofilms from two urban DWDSs (Guangzhou and Beijing, China) were determined using a 16 S rRNA gene library technique. Meanwhile, the occurrence and diversity of mycobacteria were also analyzed by a Mycobacterium-specific hsp gene assay. The biofilms from the full-scale DWDSs have complex bacterial populations. Proteobacteria was the common and predominant group in all biofilm samples, in agreement with previous re-ports. The community structures of bacteria at the three sites in Guangzhou DWDS were significantly different, despite the similar physicochemical properties of portable water. Some abundant and peculiar bacterial phylotypes were noteworthy, in-cluding Methylophilus, Massilia, and Planomicrobium, members of which are rarely found in DWDSs and their roles in DWDS biofilms are still unclear. The diversity of Mycobacterium species in biofilm samples was rather low. Mycobacterium arupense and Mycobacterium gordonae were the primary Mycobacterium species in Guangzhou and Beijing biofilms, re-spectively, indicating that M. arupense may be more resistant to chloride than M. gordonae. Key words: biofilm, drinking water distribution systems, bacterial diversity, mycobacteria.

The Kuomintang Xinjiang provincial leaders Tao Zhiyue and Burhan Shahidi led the government and army crossed over to the Communist Party of China (CPC) side in September 1949. By the end of 1949, some Kuomintang officials fled to Afghanistan, India, and Pakistan, but most crossed over or surrendered to the CPC. On August 17, 1949, the Communist Party of China sent Deng Liqun to negotiate with the Three Districts leadership in Ghulja (Yining in Chinese). Mao Zedong invited the leaders of the Three Districts {{to take part in the}} Chinese People's Political Consultative Conference later that year. The leaders of the Three Districts traveled to the Soviet Union on August 22 by automobiles through Horgos, accompanied by Soviet vice-consul in Ghulja Vasiliy Borisov, where they were told to cooperate with the Communist Party of China. Negotiations between Three Districts and Soviet representatives in Alma-Ata continued 3 days and were tough because of unwillingness of leader of Three Districts Ehmetjan Qasimi (who was opposed in his decision by at least 2 members of Three Districts-Abdulkerim Abbas and Luo Zhi) to agree to incorporate the Three Districts into future Chinese communist state, supposedly in 1951 (People's Republic of China was proclaimed 2 years earlier, on October 1, 1949, mostly due to successful testing of atomic weapon by USSR on August 29, 1949, which stripped off the monopoly of USA for this weapon of mass destruction, after this testing Stalin pressed Mao to accelerate the term of Proclamation of PRC). He regarded the current situation as a real chance for centuries for Uyghurs and other people of all Xinjiang to gain freedom and independence, that shouldn't be lost. So, the Three Districts delegation was offered to continue negotiations in Moscow directly with Stalin before departure to Beijing. On August 24, Ehmetjan Qasimi, Abdulkerim Abbas, Ishaq Beg, Luo Zhi, Dalelkhan Sugirbayev and accompanied officers of the Three Districts, total 11 members of delegation, boarded a plane in Alma-Ata, Kazakhstan, headed officially for Beijing, but flight was diverted for Moscow.

Being afraid of prosecution by the Kangxi Emperor of China, Desi Sangye Gyatso explained with fear and trepidation the reason behind his action to the Emperor. In 1705, Desi Sangye Gyatso was killed by Lha-bzang Khan of the Mongol Khoshut tribe because of his actions including his illegal action of selecting the 6th Dalai Lama. Since the Kangxi Emperor was not happy about Desi Sangye Gyatso's action of not reporting, the Emperor gave Lha-bzang Khan additional title and golden seal. The Kangxi Emperor also ordered Lha-bzang Khan to arrest the 6th Dalai Lama and send him to Beijing, the 6th Dalai Lama {{died when he was}} <b>en</b> route to <b>Beijing.</b> Journalist Thomas Laird argues that it was apparently done so that construction of the Potala Palace could be finished, and it was to prevent Tibet's neighbors, the Mongols and the Qing, from taking advantage of an interregnum in the succession of the Dalai Lamas.|$|R
5000|$|When {{the time}} came to {{transport}} the pieces of the statue to the Square, the State Security Bureau, hearing of the students' intention, declared that any truck drivers assisting them would lose their licenses. The students hired six Beijing carts (similar to a bicycle rickshaw except with a flat cart instead of a passenger area). Four carried the statue segments, and two carried the tools required to install it. The students had leaked a false itinerary of the move to throw off the authorities and moved the statue's three segments from the Central Academy of Fine Arts to the Square by another route. Students of the other academies assisting in the construction linked arms around the carts for protection in case the authorities arrived. At dusk on May 29, with fewer than 10,000 protesters remaining in the square the Art Students constructed bamboo scaffolding and then began assembling the statue. Troops called in to disrupt the movement and construction of the statue were [...] "stalled <b>en</b> route by <b>Beijing</b> residents." [...] By the early morning of May 30, the statue was fully assembled in Tiananmen Square. It broke up the north-south axis of the Square, standing between the Monument to the People's Heroes, and the Tiananmen Gate (which it faced looking at its large photograph of Mao Zedong). Whether the students had intended it or not [...] "dozens of television cameras expertly framed the ironic, silent confrontation between Goddess and Chairman." [...] When {{the time came}} for the actual unveiling, On May 30, 1989, two Beijing residents, a woman and a man, were chosen at random from the crowd and invited into the circle to pull the strings that would remove the pieces of red and blue cloth. The crowd burst into cheers and shouted slogans such as [...] "Long live democracy!" ...|$|R
40|$|Urban {{public space}} {{is one of}} the main {{components}} in urban planning because it emphasizes the interaction between people and the city itself. Public space often refers to a place that is open and accessible to all citizens but the idea of public space has changed during time and different cultures. This thesis is an analyse of urban public space in a large scale city, Beijing. The historic capital of China is right now in an intensive development phase where the urban public space is transforming. Although Beijing is more and more influenced by Western urban planning, the city still retains the traditions and symbols of ancient imperial times mixed with communist planning ideals. The analyse focused on three different categories: Form, Activities and Image/Symbols and were done through a field study of four different public spaces. These observations were also combined with literature studies and interviews with Chinese planners. The main questions were: • What perceptions does planners in Beijing hold of the idea of public space? • How is the urban public space in Beijing organized and shaped? • What kinds of activities do the residents of Beijing pursue in the use of urban public space? • How is symbolism used in Chinese planning of the urban public space, and what role does it have? It was found that Beijing has a top-down urban planning system which seems to carry on short-term goals where citizen participation is absent. Because of the rapid development, the relation to the urban context and the design quality is often poor. Chinese public space are generally of large scale, many of them expressing the power of the regime. Another conclusion was that the shape of the space is very different from Europe. Chinese public space can generally be divided into two different categories; spaces of spatiality -rooms within rooms or monumental spaces of symmetry. There is an obvious connection between outdoor quality and outdoor activities. A hypothetical conclusion is that well-defined human scale spaces results in spaces of vitality that encourages people to take part in social activities. It was also found that symbolism is an important part of Chinese culture and urban community. Feng shui is important in the way of avoiding bad elements. Colours, orientation, hierarchy and shape are important factors to consider when planning Chinese urban public spaces. Detta examensarbete är en analys av det offentliga rummet i Kina, med Beijing som exempel. Analysen fokuserar på tre olika kategorier; form, aktiviteter och symbolism och har gjorts genom <b>en</b> fältstudie i <b>Beijing.</b> Fyra olika urbana offentliga rum har studerats och observationerna har kombinerats med litteraturstudier och intervjuer med kinesiska planerare. Följande frågor diskuteras i examensarbetet: • Vad har planerare i Beijing för uppfattning om det offentliga rummet? • Hur är det urbana offentliga rummet i Beijing organiserat och utformat? • Vilka typer av aktiviteter utförs i det urbana offentliga rummet i Beijing? • Hur används symbolism inom kinesisk planering av det offentliga rummet, och vilken roll har den...|$|R
