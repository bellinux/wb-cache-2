5|$|According to writer Devin Grayson, {{the amount}} of {{creative}} freedom allowed by editors in the portrayal of LGBT characters depends upon how popular and established a character already is. Long-standing characters that would require a retcon to change their sexuality {{are less likely to}} be shown as LGBT than newer characters. When such changes to a character's continuity are made, <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> often disgruntled, particularly when sexuality is involved, and Alan Moore suggests that creating a new character is preferable.|$|E
5|$|Curtis Silver, in a {{retrospective}} for Wired, collected anecdotes from They Might Be Giants fans, {{many of whom}} were first exposed to the band through Flood. Silver concluded that new <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> drawn just as much to the band's old material as they are their more recent work, due to its sustaining accessibility. In fact, many fans cite the band's earliest albums as their favorites—though often not Flood, despite (or perhaps due to) its longstanding mainstream success.|$|E

5000|$|A {{post office}} called <b>Fanning</b> <b>was</b> {{established}} in 1887, and remained in operation until 1953. <b>Fanning</b> <b>is</b> named for John Fanning (1821-1906), originally of Limerick, Ireland. [...] John <b>Fanning</b> <b>was</b> the founding railway section foreman {{beginning in the}} mid-19th century when the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway (Frisco) was first built through the region. His home, which still stands in <b>Fanning,</b> <b>was</b> for many decades the railway station, church, post office, and social center of the community.

5|$|The Stamford Bridge freehold, the pitch, the {{turnstiles}} and Chelsea's {{naming rights}} are {{now owned by}} Chelsea Pitch Owners, a non-profit organisation in which <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> the shareholders. The CPO was created to ensure the stadium could never again be sold to developers. As a condition for using the Chelsea FC name, the club has to play its first team matches at Stamford Bridge, which means that if the club moves to a new stadium, {{they may have to}} change their name.|$|E

Toward {{the end of the}} season, <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> invited to vote, either by {{submitting}} a paper slip to the club's Carrow Road offices, or by email or text message, with the winner being the player that polls the most votes. A percentage of the votes from the 'Player of the Month' awards throughout the season also count towards the final votes for Player of the year.|$|E
25|$|Of {{the many}} {{communities}} that {{were affected by}} the disaster, the Caraballeda <b>fan</b> <b>was</b> {{one of the most}} hard-hit. The intensity of the disaster here is a combination of two factors. First, the Caraballeda <b>fan</b> <b>was</b> heavily urbanized, with many high-rise buildings and multistory houses. Second, it lies {{at the mouth of the}} Quebrada San Julián (Saint Julian Ravine), and this watershed produced very large boulders and a massive inundated area. Approximately 1/3 of the Caraballeda <b>fan</b> <b>was</b> inundated by debris flows, and the entire <b>fan</b> <b>is</b> built of past debris flow deposits.|$|R
5000|$|In Europe, <b>fans</b> <b>were</b> not a necessity. They {{were mainly}} {{used as a}} fashion accessory, to {{complement}} {{the rest of the}} lady’s outfit. “Fans were as much an adjunct to a lady of fashion’s attire as were gloves or bags.” By the 18th century <b>fans</b> <b>were</b> used only by females. The <b>fan</b> <b>was</b> described as the “feminine accessory, par excellence.” ...|$|R

5|$|Away <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> {{normally}} accommodated in {{the corner}} of the ground between the Broomloan and Govan Stands. For bigger games, such as the Old Firm derbies, the whole of the Broomloan Stand can be used by the away support. Ibrox is seen as being an intimidating ground for visiting supporters. Rangers banned Celtic fans in 1994 from attending games at Ibrox, citing the damage caused to the Broomloan Stand by the visitors in previous derbies. The ban was lifted after one game, as the Scottish Football League passed a resolution preventing clubs from taking that action. Before the corners were filled in, away fans were accommodated in the lower tier of the Broomloan Stand. Rangers had to take action in 1996 to prevent their fans in the upper deck from throwing items at visitors.|$|E
5|$|F.C. United {{are owned}} by 5,000 of their members and are the largest supporter-owned {{football}} club in the United Kingdom by number of members. Each member can vote on how the club is run, including voting for board members, kit designs and season ticket prices. Most F.C. United supporters still support Manchester United and many were previously season ticket holders at Old Trafford. F.C. United <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> known for the large range of songs that they sing at matches, and the atmosphere created by fans has been praised in the media.|$|E
5|$|Scotland <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> collectively {{known as}} the Tartan Army. During the 1970s, Scotland fans became known for their hooliganism in England, {{particularly}} after they invaded the Wembley pitch and destroyed the goalposts after the England v Scotland match in 1977. Since then, the Tartan Army have won awards from UEFA for their combination of vocal support, friendly nature and charity work. The Tartan Army have been awarded a Fair Play prize by the Belgian Olympic Committee and were named as the best supporters during the 1992 European Championship. The fans were also presented with a trophy for non-violence in sport and were voted by journalists {{to be the best}} supporters for their sense of fair play and sporting spirit at the 1998 World Cup in France.|$|E

5|$|The Ipswich Town Player of the Year {{award is}} voted for {{annually}} by Ipswich Town's supporters {{in recognition of}} the best overall performance by an individual player throughout the football season. Towards the end of each season, <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> invited to cast their votes for this award. They do this by submitting a paper slip to the club's Portman Road offices, with the winner being the player who polls the most votes. The recipient is awarded a rosebowl trophy, presented on the pitch before one of the last home games of the season.|$|E
5|$|The lower tier of the Southern Stand is {{reserved}} for away supporters, {{with most of the}} stand being seated. The western part of the stand, however, is converted into terracing for domestic league games. The area reserved for away supporters varies from game to game depending on how many away <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> expecting: the allocation's size is altered by restricting access to and from the area with large safety nets, which are laid across the seating and supervised by stewards. The away section is small for most Allsvenskan matches, with the most notable exceptions being matches against Helsingborgs IF, AIK, Djurgårdens IF, and IFK Göteborg. These matches tend to draw larger away attendances, and the away area is therefore accordingly expanded across the entire lower tier of the Southern Stand.|$|E
5|$|The northernmost {{stand of}} the ground is the David Longhurst Stand, which is a covered terrace for home {{supporters}} and has a row of supporting pillars across its front. The stand was originally known as the Shipton Street End, but was renamed {{following the death of}} David Longhurst, and has a capacity of 3,062. Opposite is the Grosvenor Road End, an open terrace reserved for away supporters, which holds a capacity of 1,785. As well as this, away <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> permitted to use 332 seats of the Popular Stand, in the section closest to the Grosvenor Road End. The toilet facilities for away supporters consist of open air urinals for men and Portakabins for women.|$|E

5|$|Wodehouse worked {{extensively}} on his books, sometimes having {{two or more}} in preparation simultaneously. He would take {{up to two years}} to build a plot and write a scenario of about thirty thousand words. After the scenario was complete he would write the story. Early in his career he would produce a novel in about three months, but he slowed in old age to around six months. He used a mixture of Edwardian slang, quotations from and allusions to numerous poets, and several literary techniques to produce a prose style that has been compared with comic poetry and musical comedy. Some critics of Wodehouse have considered his work flippant, but among his <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> former British prime ministers and many of his fellow writers.|$|E
5|$|Just {{like the}} {{neighbouring}} Swedbank Stadion, Malmö Stadion is currently served by Malmö bus lines 3, 5, 6 and 34, {{all of which}} stop {{in the vicinity of}} the two stadiums. Local transit authority Skånetrafiken also operates dedicated match-day buses, branded as line 84, which run from different areas of Malmö when Malmö FF play home matches at Swedbank Stadion. Due to the central location of the two stadiums within the city, parking space is limited, and spectators are advised to use public transportation, particularly for more prominent matches at Swedbank Stadion. This does not apply to matchdays for IFK Malmö, as not so many <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> drawn for that club's games. Malmö Stadion is also near the underground railway station Triangeln, which opened in December 2010 as a part of Citytunneln. The station is served by Pågatåg and Öresund Trains, and is reachable non-stop from many parts of the Öresund Region.|$|E
5|$|One hundred {{players were}} chosen {{to be on the}} ballot for the All-Star Game (minimum of two players from each team), but fans were also given the option to write in any player who was not listed. Ballots were all digital for the fourth {{consecutive}} time, giving fans the ability to cast votes online at NHL.com and Facebook. Votes could also be cast via text messages from mobile devices and Smartphone users could vote by way of a mobile ballot feature. The NHL put no limitation on the number of votes an individual could cast. When fan balloting ended, 14.3 million votes had been cast and the top six were named to the All-Star Game. The six top vote recipients were from only two teams, the Pittsburgh Penguins (4) and Chicago Blackhawks (2). Individually, Sidney Crosby led all players with 635,509 votes, while teammate Kris Letang was elected as a write-in candidate. The six players elected by the <b>fans</b> <b>are</b> listed below with their vote totals.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Fans</b> <b>were</b> used {{throughout}} history, {{and can be}} traced back as long as five thousand years ago. They developed in ancient Egypt, India, and China where they were used for ceremonies and practical purposes. In the 12th century, during the Crusades, the <b>fan</b> <b>was</b> brought to Europe. At first, Europeans adopted the rigid fan and feather fans. Queen Elizabeth I of England (1533-1603) owned dozens of these <b>fans,</b> as <b>was</b> shown in her portraits. Later in the 16th century, folding <b>fans</b> <b>were</b> introduced into Europe from Japan where they originated.|$|R
