Deliberate self-harm is common <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world.</b> Research into self-harm <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is however still very limited although an important {{case study is}} that of Sri Lanka, which is a country exhibiting {{a high incidence of}} suicide and self-poisoning with agricultural pesticides or natural poisons. Many people admitted for deliberate self-poisoning during a study by Eddleston et al. were young and few expressed a desire to die, but death was relatively common in the young in these cases. The improvement of medical management of acute poisoning <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>developing</b> <b>world</b> is poor and improvements are required in order to reduce mortality.|$|E
