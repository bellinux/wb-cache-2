5|$|<b>Digestive</b> <b>tract</b> telangiectasias may be {{identified}} on esophagogastroduodenoscopy (endoscopy of the esophagus, stomach and {{first part of}} the small intestine). This procedure will typically only be undertaken if there is anemia that is more marked than expected by the severity of nosebleeds, or if there is evidence of severe bleeding (vomiting blood, black stools). If the number of lesions seen on endoscopy is unexpectedly low, the remainder of the small intestine may be examined with capsule endoscopy, in which the patient swallows a capsule-shaped device containing a miniature camera which transmits images of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> to a portable digital recorder.|$|E
5|$|Neptunium {{does not}} have a {{biological}} role, as it has a short half-life and occurs only in small traces naturally. Animal tests showed that it is not absorbed via the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> When injected it concentrates in the bones, from which it is slowly released.|$|E
5|$|Video {{fluoroscopy}} uses {{x-ray radiation}} to produce moving {{pictures of the}} mouth during articulation or swallowing. It is considered the gold standard in studies of dysphagia because {{of its ability to}} take videos of the entire <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> during swallowing events. It is often used to study and treat aspiration of food, what parts of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> are malfunctioning during swallowing, and positions in which swallowing is easiest. Only limited data is able to be collected as sessions are typically limited to three minutes due to the hazards of radiation exposure. and it does not allow for fine grain analysis of tongue movements.|$|E

5|$|About 20% are {{affected}} by symptomatic <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> lesions, although a higher percentage have lesions that do not cause symptoms. These lesions may bleed intermittently, which is rarely significant enough to be noticed (in the form of bloody vomiting or black stool), but can eventually lead to depletion of iron in the body, resulting in iron-deficiency anemia.|$|E
5|$|Although it has {{not been}} shown {{experimentally}} if the spores can survive the passage through an animal's <b>digestive</b> <b>tract,</b> the regular presence of Cyathus on cow or horse manure strongly suggest that this is true. Alternatively, the hard outer casing of peridioles ejected from splash cups may simply disintegrate over time, eventually releasing the spores within.|$|E
5|$|Brachytherapy {{can also}} be used in the {{treatment}} of tumours of the brain, eye, head and neck region (lip, floor of mouth, tongue, nasopharynx and oropharynx), respiratory tract (trachea and bronchi), <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> (oesophagus, gall bladder, bile-ducts, rectum, anus), urinary tract (bladder, urethra, penis), female reproductive tract (uterus, vagina, vulva), and soft tissues.|$|E

5|$|A {{quarter of}} all people with Guillain–Barré {{syndrome}} develop weakness of the breathing muscles leading to respiratory failure, the inability to breathe adequately to maintain healthy levels of oxygen and/or {{carbon dioxide in the}} blood. This life-threatening scenario is complicated by other medical problems such as pneumonia, severe infections, blood clots in the lungs and bleeding in the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> in 60% of those who require artificial ventilation.|$|E
5|$|In a study, eight addax antelopes {{on a diet}} {{of grass}} hay (Chloris gayana) were studied to {{determine}} the retention time of food from the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> It was found that food retention time was long, taken as an adaptation to a diet including {{a high proportion of}} slow fermenting grasses; while the long fluid retention time could be interpreted to be due to water-saving mechanisms with low water turnover and a roomy rumen.|$|E
5|$|It {{may lead}} to nosebleeds, acute and chronic <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> bleeding, and various {{problems}} due to the involvement of other organs. Treatment focuses on reducing bleeding from blood vessel lesions, and sometimes surgery or other targeted interventions to remove arteriovenous malformations in organs. Chronic bleeding often requires iron supplements and sometimes blood transfusions. HHT is transmitted in an autosomal dominant fashion, and occurs in one in 5,000 people.|$|E
5000|$|The Neocallimastigales, {{originally}} {{an order}} of anaerobic fungi of the class Chytridiomycetes, found in the <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> of herbivores, was later raised to a separate phylum, the Neocallimastigomycota.|$|R
50|$|Brachylaimidae is {{a family}} of {{parasitic}} flukes in the sub-class Digenea. Adults are usually found within the <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> and other organs of mammals or birds and have a complex three-stage life cycle.|$|R
40|$|More than 285 {{specimens}} of Conotheca subcurvata with three-dimensionally preserved <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> were {{recovered from the}} Terreneuvian (early Cambrian) Heraultia Limestone of the northern Montagne Noire, southern France. They represent {{one of the oldest}} occurrences of such preserved guts. The newly discovered operculum of some complete specimens provides additional data allowing emendation of the species diagnosis. Infestation of the U-shaped <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> by smooth uniseriate, branching to anastomosing filaments along with isolated botryoidal coccoids attests to their early, microbially mediated phosphatisation. Apart from taphonomic deformation, C. subcurvata exhibits three different configurations of the digestive tract: (1) anal tube and gut parallel, straight to slightly undulating; (2) anal tube straight and loosely folded gut; and (3) anal tube straight and gut straight with local zigzag folds. The arrangement of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> and its correlation with the mean apertural diameter of the specimens are interpreted as ontogenetically dependent. The simple U-shaped gut, usually considered as characteristic of the Hyolithida, developed in earlier stages of C. subcurvata, whereas the more complex orthothecid type- 3 only appears in largest specimens. This growth pattern suggests a distinc...|$|R
5|$|Jaws allow fish {{to eat a}} {{wide variety}} of food, {{including}} plants and other organisms. Fish ingest food through the mouth and break it down in the esophagus. In the stomach, food is further digested and, in many fish, processed in finger-shaped pouches called pyloric caeca, which secrete digestive enzymes and absorb nutrients. Organs such as the liver and pancreas add enzymes and various chemicals as the food moves through the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> The intestine completes the process of digestion and nutrient absorption.|$|E
5|$|Millipedes breathe {{through two}} pairs of spiracles located ventrally on each segment near {{the base of the}} legs. Each opens into an {{internal}} pouch, and connects to a system of tracheae. The heart runs {{the entire length of the}} body, with an aorta stretching into the head. The excretory organs are {{two pairs of}} malpighian tubules, located near the mid-part of the gut. The <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> is a simple tube with two pairs of salivary glands to help digest the food.|$|E
5|$|On {{the basis}} of symptoms, it is {{possible}} to distinguish HSP from hypersensitivity vasculitis (HV). In a series comparing 85 HSP patients with 93 HV patients, five symptoms were found to be indicative of HSP: palpable purpura, abdominal angina, <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> hemorrhage (not due to intussussception), hematuria and age less than 20. The presence of three or more of these indicators has an 87% sensitivity for predicting HSP.|$|E

40|$|On {{the basis}} of 16 S rRNA gene {{sequence}} analyses, this group comprises {{one of the primary}} lineages in the phylum Verrucomicrobia and is equivalent to subdivision 1 (Hugenholtz etal., 1998) of the phylum. The majority of its members inhabit marine and freshwater habitats or vertebrate <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts,</b> including humans, however, some have been recovered from soils. The Verrucomicrobia currently comprise one order, at present represented by three families, Verrucomicrobiaceae, Akkermansiaceae, and Rubritaleaceae. Each family includes one or more cultivated and taxonomically described genus and is found primarily in a single habitat type, namely, freshwater habitats, vertebrate <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts,</b> and marine habitats, respectively.

50|$|Strains of Wolinella {{have been}} {{isolated}} from feline and canine oral cavities. Only one strain is currently published with Candidatus status: Candidatus Wolinella africanus. This strain was {{isolated from the}} upper <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> of a Venezuelan volunteer.|$|R
5|$|The {{preserved}} {{contents of}} its <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> {{are typical of}} those of other predators', and this lifestyle {{is supported by the}} raptor-like nature of the spiny great appendages {{and the size of the}} eyes. The organism was clearly a competent swimmer, propelling itself with the 'flippers' attached to its head, and using its wing-like lobes on the 11th segment to steer. These lobes presumably derived from the lateral lobes of Cambrian anomalocaridids, ancestors that used lobes along their sides to swim, and lacked the specializations of Schinderhannes.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptomatic}} (determinate) chronic stage {{affects the}} nervous system, digestive system and heart. About two-thirds {{of people with}} chronic symptoms have cardiac damage, including dilated cardiomyopathy, which causes heart rhythm abnormalities and may result in sudden death. About one-third of patients go on to develop digestive system damage, resulting in dilation of the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> (megacolon and megaesophagus), accompanied by severe weight loss. Swallowing difficulties (secondary achalasia) {{may be the first}} symptom of digestive disturbances and may lead to malnutrition.|$|E
5|$|To {{maintain}} a high constant body temperature is energy expensive – mammals therefore need a nutritious and plentiful diet. While the earliest mammals were probably predators, different species have since adapted {{to meet their}} dietary requirements {{in a variety of}} ways. Some eat other animals – this is a carnivorous diet (and includes insectivorous diets). Other mammals, called herbivores, eat plants, which contain complex carbohydrates such as cellulose. An herbivorous diet includes subtypes such as granivory (seed eating), folivory (leaf eating), frugivory (fruit eating), nectarivory (nectar eating), gummivory (gum eating) and mycophagy (fungus eating). The <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> of an herbivore is host to bacteria that ferment these complex substances, and make them available for digestion, which are either housed in the multichambered stomach or in a large cecum. Some mammals are coprophagous, consuming feces to absorb the nutrients not digested when the food was first ingested. An omnivore eats both prey and plants. Carnivorous mammals have a simple <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> because the proteins, lipids and minerals found in meat require {{little in the way of}} specialized digestion. Exceptions to this include baleen whales who also house gut flora in a multi-chambered stomach, like terrestrial herbivores.|$|E

50|$|Hymenolepiasis {{is caused}} by the {{introduction}} of either tapeworm species Hymenolepis nana (H. nana) or Hymenolepis diminuta (H. diminuta) into the human body. A member of the cestode class, tapeworms do not have <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> to absorb nutrients, instead their surface body layer is metabolically active with nutrients and waste passing in and out continuously. In contrast, the nematodes class, such as hookworms, have complete <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts</b> and separate orifices for food ingestion and waste excretion. Although the cestode life cycle requires the cysticercoid, or larval, phase to be developed in an intermediate host, H. nana does not follow this observation and can use an intermediate host or auto infect the human host.|$|R

5|$|After {{the deaths}} of the Gienkes, {{authorities}} began to investigate the cluster of deaths. The county sheriff, Fred Roshon, soon discovered that Martha Wise had signed at a local drug store for a series of purchases of large quantities of arsenic. An autopsy on Lily Gienke confirmed the presence of arsenic in her <b>digestive</b> <b>tract.</b> Brought in for questioning by the sheriff, Wise at first claimed she had obtained the arsenic to kill rats, but eventually confessed that she had used it to poison family members by putting it in water buckets and coffee pots the family drank out of.|$|E
5|$|In February 2009, MOBA {{announced}} a fundraiser {{to assist the}} Rose Art Museum at Brandeis University, which was seriously considering whether to sell masterpieces because of the global financial crisis of 2008–2009, made worse for the university by some of its donors losing money in Bernard Madoff's investment scheme. Current MOBA curator and balloon artist/musician Michael Frank placed Studies in Digestion—a four-panel piece showing four renditions of the human <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> in various media by artist Deborah Grumet—on eBay for a buy-it-now price of $10,000; the first bid was $24.99. It eventually sold for $152.53 and the meager proceeds went to the Rose Art Museum, while both museums gained publicity.|$|E
5|$|LACM 149371 is {{a poorly}} {{preserved}} molar-like tooth that largely lacks a recognizable enamel surface and shows many small grooves and holes on the crown surface. This suggests the tooth {{may have been}} chemically degraded, perhaps by acidic water or because it passed through the <b>digestive</b> <b>tract</b> of a predator. The roots are broken off, but remaining pulp cavities suggest the presence of four main roots, which are partially joined into two pairs. A smaller pulp cavity between those roots suggests the likely presence of a fifth root and a slight depression in the tooth may represent another root.|$|E
50|$|One {{example of}} glycoproteins {{found in the}} body is mucins, which are {{secreted}} in the mucus of the respiratory and <b>digestive</b> <b>tracts.</b> The sugars when attached to mucins give them considerable water-holding capacity and also make them resistant to proteolysis by digestive enzymes.|$|R
