After a short break, he was invited to lead the UFP in Rhodesia, which had recently renamed itself the Rhodesia Party. With the Rhodesian Front pushing for independence for the territory and a new constitution, the Rhodesia Party advocated the same, but with a focus on stemming white emigration and rebuilding the economy (all three territories had slipped <b>into</b> <b>recession</b> {{with the end of the}} federation).|$|E
5|$|By {{the time}} the Voss Line was {{completed}} Norway had plunged <b>into</b> <b>recession.</b> Parliament {{was not willing to}} give more money to railways, and the country had to make do with a transport plan launched in 1886 that did not follow up with any funding. On 1 March 1894 parliament after five days of debate chose, with 60 against 53 votes, to build the Bergen Line. Several different routes had been proposed, including over Krøderen, or down Numedal (which later would get the Numedal Line). In the end Hallingdal was chosen, connecting to Hønefoss and via Sandvika. To save costs a preliminary line would connect Hønefoss to Roa with the branch Roa–Hønefoss Line. The final stage would be along the Gjøvik Line to Oslo. The line would also connect to the system via the Randsfjorden Line at Hønefoss.|$|E

I was chief economist at the World Bank from 1996 until last November, during the gravest global economic crisis in a half-century.

5000|$|Conference Board - Consumer Confidence, Conference Board’s Present Situation Index - Major {{turns in}} the Conference Board’s Present Situation Index tend to precede {{corresponding}} {{turns in the}} unemployment rate—particularly at business cycle peaks (that is, going <b>into</b> <b>recessions).</b> Major upturns in the index also tend to foreshadow cyclical peaks in the unemployment rate, which often occur well {{after the end of}} a recession. Another useful feature of the index that can be gleaned from the charts is its ability to signal sustained downturns in payroll employment. Whenever the year-over-year change in this index has turned negative by more than 15 points, the economy has entered <b>into</b> a <b>recession.</b> The most useful methods to predict business cycle use methods similar to the organization as Eurostat, OECD and Conference Board.|$|R

50|$|Neoclassical {{models of}} the economy tend not to {{incorporate}} the idea of feedback. Feedback is important as it can cause economies that are doing well or badly to undergo positive feedback, making downturns worse and recoveries into bubbles that then burst <b>into</b> <b>recessions.</b> In the presence of positive feedback, shocks become amplified, becoming much more serious than they are. As a result, shock therapy is never the answer to economic recovery, and there is often wisdom to initial government intervention to break the vicious cycle.|$|R

Advances in technology, accumulation of machinery and other capital, and better education and human capital all these factors lead to increased economic output over time. However, output does not always increase consistently. Business cycles can cause short-term drops in output called recessions. Economists look for macroeconomic policies that prevent economies from slipping <b>into</b> <b>recessions</b> and that lead to faster long-term growth.|$|R

This thesis investigates how effective intervention measures are. Do they reduce the duration of recessions? And more specifically, what are the effects of bank recapitalizations?

The authors {{suggest that the}} excessive caution shown by private sector forecasters limits the usefulness of their forecasts in answering these questions. Using growth forecasts for 14 major economies from 1990 onwards, they demonstrate that revisions made to forecast are extremely smooth. An implication of this smoothness is that forecasters do not call a recession until fairly {{late in the year}} in which the recession occurs. They are also slow to absorb news about developments outside their own economies, limiting the ability of the growth forecasts to predict the extent of decoupling. ...|$|R
