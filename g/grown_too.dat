5|$|The fifth {{mission in}} the World Heritage Site, that of San Miguel de Velasco, was {{established}} by the Jesuits Fr. Felipe Suarez and Fr. Francisco Hervás in 1721. San Miguel was {{an offshoot of the}} mission of San Rafael de Velaso, where the population had <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> large. The mission church was built between 1752 and 1759, probably by Fr. Johann Messner, a collaborator with or student of Fr. Martin Schmid. The church was restored by Hans Roth between 1979 and 1983.|$|E
5|$|Connected {{protected}} areas {{are important for}} the conservation of slow lorises because these primates are not adapted to travel long distances on the ground. Training for enforcement officials helps improve identification and the awareness of their legal protection. Sanctuaries and rescue facilities are available to provide both temporary and lifelong care for confiscated slow lorises. Zoo populations of some species have not bred much and have <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> old to reproduce, although the pygmy slow loris is doing well at some facilities, such as the San Diego Zoo.|$|E
5|$|Married couple Jared and Jerusha Hess were co-writers and {{directors}} of the 2004 film Napoleon Dynamite, and had wanted to do an animated version since the film's release. They thought animation {{was the best way}} to continue the world of Napoleon Dynamite as the original actors had <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> old to play teenage characters. Following the film's success, Fox Searchlight Pictures wanted a sequel, but the Hesses delayed due to commitments to other projects and fear that audiences would tire of the Napoleon Dynamite characters.|$|E

5|$|Therefore, the Government {{felt that}} the best way to ensure {{minority}} representation in Parliament was to introduce the GRC scheme. In addition, it took the view that such a scheme would complement the introduction of town councils to manage public housing estates, as it would be economical for a town council to manage a group of three constituencies. Subsequently, in 1991, the Government said that GRCs also minimized the need to redraw the boundaries of constituencies which had <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> big for the MPs serving them, and, in 1996, GRCs were said to provide Community Development Councils with the critical mass of residents that they needed to be effective.|$|E
5|$|Crofting is the {{mainstay}} of island life. Sheep form {{the backbone of the}} agricultural economy but a diversity livestock are kept, including cattle, pigs, goats, chickens, ducks and geese. Vegetable are <b>grown</b> <b>too,</b> often in the shelter of circular walls, such plots being known as 'plantie scrubs'. Fishing is still conducted but on a relatively small scale. There is a post office at the pier, but no shop. Mains electricity only came to the island {{at the close of the}} twentieth century. The Papa Stour Project is a Christian supported housing service offering accommodation to men with drug and alcohol issues. Ferries now sail across the Sound of Papa to West Burrafirth on the Shetland Mainland. The crossing takes 45 minutes, and although the Snolda carries cars, there is only one short road on the island. For visiting yachts the four main voes provide good shelter, but the strong tides in both the Sound of Papa and to the north west require considerable care.|$|E
5|$|For the sequel, Mane, McDowell, Taylor-Compton, Harris, Moon Zombie, and Dourif {{returned}} to the roles of Michael Myers, Dr. Loomis, Laurie Strode, Annie Brackett, Deborah Myers, and Sheriff Brackett, respectively. Daeg Faerch, who portrayed a young Michael Myers in the 2007 remake, was set to reprise his role for Halloween II. By the time production was getting started for the sequel Faerch had <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> big for the part. Zombie had to recast the role, much to his own dismay, because Faerch's physical maturity did not fit {{what was in the}} script. Although Faerch is not in the sequel, the first trailer for Halloween II contained images of Faerch. Zombie pointed out that those images were test shots done and were not intended to be in either the trailer or the film.|$|E

5|$|After that season, coach Alex Hannum {{wanted to}} be closer to his family on the West Coast; he left the Sixers to coach the Oakland Oaks in the newly founded American Basketball Association. Chamberlain then asked for a trade, and Sixers general manager Jack Ramsay traded him to the Los Angeles Lakers for Darrall Imhoff, Archie Clark and Jerry Chambers. The {{motivation}} for this move remains in dispute. According to sportswriter Roland Lazenby, a journalist close to the Lakers, Chamberlain was angry at Kosloff for breaking the alleged Richman-Chamberlain deal, but according to Dr. Jack Ramsay, who was the Sixers general manager then, Chamberlain also threatened to jump to the ABA after Hannum left, and forced the trade himself. Cherry finally adds several personal reasons: the center felt he had <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> big for Philadelphia, sought the presence of fellow celebrities (which were plenty in L.A.) and finally also desired the opportunity to date white women, which was possible for a black man in L.A. but hard to imagine elsewhere back then.|$|E

25|$|The {{only true}} {{break in the}} series dates back to 1917 and the United States entry into World War I. The two {{institutions}} felt that the rivalry had <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> intense, fueled by Georgia's inflammatory accusations that Georgia Tech was cowardly because the school continued its football program during wartime while Georgia suspended its program for the football seasons of 1917 and 1918.

25|$|With {{the end of}} the Civil War, the National Army had <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> big for a peacetime {{role and}} was too {{expensive}} for the new Irish state to maintain. In addition, many of the civil war recruits were badly trained and undisciplined, making them unsuitable material for a full-time professional army. The Special Infantry Corps was established to perform the army's first post-war duty, breaking the strikes of agricultural labourers in Munster and south Leinster, as well as reversing factory seizures by socialists.|$|E
30|$|In short, {{there are}} cases where {{economic}} growth has taken place and formal employment has increased slowly or even decreased.

25|$|By {{the time}} the impact of Mikhail Gorbachev's reform program in the Soviet Union was felt in Bulgaria in the late 1980s, the Communists, like their leader, had <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> feeble to resist the demand for change for long. In November 1989 demonstrations on {{ecological}} issues were staged in Sofia and these soon broadened into a general campaign for political reform. The Communists reacted by deposing the decrepit Zhivkov and replacing him by Petar Mladenov, but this gained them only a short respite.|$|E
25|$|Auditory canal {{decompression}} {{is another}} surgical technique that can prolong usable hearing when a vestibular schwannoma has <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> large to remove without {{damage to the}} cochlear nerve. In the IAC (internal auditory canal) decompression, a middle fossa approach is employed to expose the bony roof of the IAC without any attempt to remove the tumor. The bone overlying the acoustic nerve is removed, allowing the tumour to expand upward into the middle cranial fossa. In this way, pressure on the cochlear nerve is relieved, {{reducing the risk of}} further hearing loss from direct compression or obstruction of vascular supply to the nerve.|$|E
25|$|King Philip IV (r. 1285-1314) reconstructed {{the royal}} {{residence}} on the Île de la Cité, transforming {{it into a}} palace. Two of the great ceremonial halls still remain within {{the structure of the}} Palais de Justice. He also built a more sinister structure, the Gibbet of Montfaucon, near the modern Place du Colonel Fabien and the Parc des Buttes Chaumont, where the corpses of executed criminals were displayed. On 13 October 1307, he used his royal power to arrest the members of the Knights Templar, who, he felt, had <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> powerful, and on 18 March 1314, he had the Grand Master of the Order, Jacques de Molay, burned at the stake on the western point of the Île de la Cité.|$|E

25|$|Swarm {{emigration}} {{occurs when}} a colony moves from the location of one nest to a new nesting site. This may occur for several reasons. One is if the colony sends a reproductive swarm from the original nest. This may happen if the colony has <b>grown</b> <b>too</b> big, and must split into two new colonies. In this situation, part of the colony {{will remain in the}} original nest, with a subgroup leaving to colonize a new nesting site. Other reasons swarm emigration occurs is if an old nest becomes unsuitable, or if the nest is attacked by a predator. At first, when the colony is driven from the nest, individuals assemble in groups of 2 or 3 around the original nest. Wasps will exchange between groups until the entire colony is assembled in one cluster. The colony may remain in this cluster for up to 2 days before migrating to the new site. Once the colony begins to travel, leading individuals will drag their gaster over prominent objects such as branches or tall grass. This releases a pheromone that other workers can follow to the new nesting site.|$|E
