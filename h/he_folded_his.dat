60|$|<b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms {{again and}} raised his sharp chin with a bitter smile.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms complacently; {{he looked}} {{perfectly}} satisfied {{to leave the}} matter there.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> razor neatly {{and with}} {{stroking}} palps of fingers felt the smooth skin.|$|E
6000|$|... "Wolf!" [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>folding</b> <b>his</b> arms again, [...] "Old Orlick's a {{going to}} tell you somethink. It was you as did for your shrew sister." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mr. Draper, {{you suppose}} {{a great deal}} more than you know," [...] says Mr. Warrington, looking very fierce and tall, as <b>he</b> <b>folds</b> <b>his</b> brocade dressing-gown round him.|$|R
6000|$|LIEUTENANT (drawing himself upright). I say it again, {{just wait}} until I catch him. Just wait: that's all. (<b>He</b> <b>folds</b> <b>his</b> arms resolutely, and {{breathes}} hard, with compressed lips.) ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms, {{crossed his}} legs, frowned and {{reasoned}} with himself,--resolved to dismiss post-mortem speculations--absolutely.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms, {{and looked}} like {{the image of a}} man who {{intended}} to keep his word.|$|E
60|$|When Peter had {{finished}} his strawberries <b>he</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> {{arms on the}} table and looked admiringly at Nancy.|$|E
60|$|CHARTERIS (tenderly). Absolutely. (She beams with delight. A sudden revulsion {{comes to}} him at the sight: he recoils, {{dropping}} her hands and crying) Ah no: why should I lie to you? (<b>He</b> <b>folds</b> <b>his</b> arms and adds firmly) My happiness depends on nobody but myself. I can do without you.|$|R
6000|$|... "The eagle sails slowly {{round and}} round, up and up," [...] replied Half King, with majestic gestures, [...] "until his eye sees all, until he knows <b>his</b> time; then <b>he</b> <b>folds</b> <b>his</b> wings and swoops {{down from the}} blue sky like the forked fire. So does White Chief. But Half King is impatient." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "More than that," [...] said <b>he,</b> <b>folding</b> <b>his</b> arms on {{the table}} again, [...] "I won't have a rag of you, I won't have a bone of you, left on earth. I'll put your body in the kiln,--I'd carry two such to it, on my Shoulders,--and, let people suppose what they may of you, they shall never know nothing." ...|$|R
60|$|Hartley cringed {{as if from}} an {{unexpected}} blow. <b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms and paced the carpet once or twice.|$|E
60|$|Murray {{hurried back}} to the bench in the park. <b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms and shrank within his clothes to his ghost-like presentment.|$|E
60|$|There {{was a very}} {{pregnant}} pause. Mr Bethany shrunk back {{a little}} into his chair. His lips moved; <b>he</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> spectacles.|$|E
6000|$|She {{thought it}} would annoy him, but <b>he</b> only <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms under his head, with an imperturbable, [...] "That's not bad. Thank you, ladies." ...|$|R
6000|$|... '"You first," [...] he says, and flings {{the cage}} {{out of the}} window. [...] "Now you," [...] {{he says to the}} yellow dog, putting him out through the door. And then <b>he</b> <b>folds</b> <b>his</b> arms and scowls at us, and we all notice {{suddenly}} that he's very big. We look at one another, and we begins to edge towards the door. All except Jane, who's staring at Jerry as if he's a ghost.|$|R
6000|$|... "'That {{is a very}} {{different}} thing,' and she looked at him with a little shake of the head, for <b>he</b> was <b>folding</b> <b>his</b> hands and doing the passionate pathetic.|$|R
60|$|And he led {{the tired}} Fairy to a little cell, where {{on a bed of}} flower-leaves <b>he</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> wings and fell asleep.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> hands, and murmuring {{something}} more {{they could not}} hear, fell into a sleep--only a sleep at first, for they saw him smile.|$|E
6000|$|... "Chug-a-rum!" [...] said Grandfather Frog, [...] "and now I {{suppose you}} want a story." [...] And <b>he</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> hands across his white and yellow waistcoat.|$|E
6000|$|Mr Haredale {{surveyed}} {{him with}} a look of cold contempt. 'You may evade an explanation, I know,' <b>he</b> said, <b>folding</b> <b>his</b> arms. 'But I must have it. I can wait.' ...|$|R
60|$|His cousin {{bowed his}} head over the {{delicate}} form of Eve, which <b>he</b> <b>folded</b> with <b>his</b> arms, as if to shield it from the blasts and evils of the desert.|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything {{goes well}} with me," [...] <b>he</b> said, <b>folding</b> <b>his</b> arms under him and {{regarding}} Ann Veronica with the slightly projecting eyes wide open. [...] "And I'm not happy. I believe I'm in love." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> {{arms and}} {{regarded}} the pair with a bitter smile; Mrs. Bowman, quite {{unable to meet}} his eyes, still gazed intently at the floor.|$|E
60|$|That, {{he thought}} should humble her. <b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> letter round Ombreval's and having sealed the package, he {{addressed}} it as Ombreval had addressed his own missive.|$|E
60|$|Melchior groaned. <b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> child still {{nearer to}} his heart, while the {{athletic}} Sigismund shielded his drooping sister, as the fowl shelters its young beneath the wing.|$|E
60|$|At {{this point}} Jo {{was arrested by}} the sound of {{footsteps}} behind him. <b>He</b> <b>folded</b> up <b>his</b> letter precipitately, thrust it into his left breast-pocket, and jumped up with a guilty air about him.|$|R
6000|$|... "Pretty good, sir," [...] <b>he</b> replied, <b>folding</b> <b>his</b> arms {{upon his}} broad chest and looking very large. [...] "If Mr. Carstone {{was to give}} his full mind to it, he would come out very good." ...|$|R
60|$|At last <b>he</b> paused, <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> {{hands over}} the head of his cane, and steadfastly gazed upon us. The notes of the nasal {{orchestra}} were rising and falling upon his ear, and a new idea suggested itself.|$|R
6000|$|... 'I will do {{anything}} {{within the limits of}} possibility, for you, Lizzie,' he answered with pleasant gaiety as <b>he</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> arms. 'See here! Napoleon Buonaparte at St Helena.' ...|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> {{arms and}} sat {{looking at me}} with an air of the profoundest astonishment, {{awaiting}} what I should say next. I {{did not know how to}} prepare him.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>folded</b> <b>his</b> {{arms and}} {{stood in front of}} the closed door. Without a collar, his neck bulged unpleasantly behind. There was nothing {{whatever}} left of the suave and genial chef d'orchestra.|$|E
6000|$|... "It's Peter," [...] said Honora, flying downstairs. And {{she caught}} him, astonished, as <b>he</b> was <b>folding</b> <b>his</b> {{umbrella}} on the step. [...] "Oh, Peter, {{if you tried}} until to-morrow morning, you never could guess what has happened." ...|$|R
50|$|During {{the actual}} filming, he {{contracted}} pneumonia and {{was suffering from}} a fever, which intensified his anger over the video. Fenske says he did not notice, but allows that he was nervous and busy since {{it was the first}} video he had directed and he had many other things to pay attention to. According to Hagar, the scene where <b>he</b> <b>folds</b> <b>his</b> arms and refuses to sing, {{and the end of the}} video where he slams the dressing room door were not staged - he was genuinely angry.|$|R
6000|$|... ‘I am unconsciously,’ {{he observes}} with a smile, as <b>he</b> <b>folds</b> <b>his</b> hands upon the sun-dial and leans his chin upon them, {{so that his}} talk would seem from the windows (faces {{occasionally}} come and go there) {{to be of the}} airiest and playfullest—‘I am unconsciously giving offence by questioning again. I will simply make statements, therefore, and not put questions. You do care for your bosom friend’s good name, and you do care for her peace of mind. Then remove the shadow of the gallows from her, dear one!’ ...|$|R
