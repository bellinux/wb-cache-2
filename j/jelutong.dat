25|$|As Penang is {{relatively}} land-scarce, land reclamation {{projects have been}} undertaken to provide suitable low-lying land in high-demand areas such as Tanjung Tokong, <b>Jelutong</b> and Queensbay. These projects were implicated in the change of tidal flow along some coastal areas of Penang Island and the silting of Gurney Drive.|$|E
25|$|The {{expansion}} of George Town has created suburbs to its northwest, west and south. The northwestern suburbs are somewhat more affluent, given their seafront locations which attract tourists and expatriates. The southern suburbs, such as <b>Jelutong,</b> grew due to industrial activities. On the other hand, Air Itam and Paya Terubong emerged {{to the west}} of George Town as a result of agricultural plantations on the central hills of Penang Island.|$|E
25|$|Development of George Town's {{streets and}} roads {{is an ongoing}} process {{that dates back to}} the early years of British rule. The city's oldest streets, {{including}} Light Street, Beach Street, Chulia Street and Pitt Street, were arranged in a grid pattern. Outside the narrow streets of the city centre, more modern roads link the city centre with the surrounding suburbs such as Tanjung Tokong, Air Itam and <b>Jelutong.</b>|$|E
25|$|In {{the early}} 18th century, ethnic Minangkabaus from Sumatra {{opened up a}} {{settlement}} on Penang Island.

Later, the Arabs arrived and settled mainly at <b>Jelutong.</b> The Arabs then intermarried with the Minangkabau; this {{gave rise to the}} Arab-Minangkabau admixture now described as Malay, as they have assimilated into the local Malay community.|$|E
25|$|On July 2008, <b>Jelutong</b> MP Jeff Ooi {{reported}} that the loan for the bridge risked being withdrawn if the shareholder agreement between UEM Builders Berhad and its joint-venture partner CHEC was not inked by August 2008. It was {{reported that}} there were disagreements {{between the two parties}} on the apportionment of the cost of building the bridge although the issue was expected to be resolved quickly due to UEM having a variation on the price on its portion.|$|E
25|$|The {{contiguous}} {{hotel and}} resort belts of Batu Ferringhi and Tanjung Bungah and Tanjung Tokong {{along the northern}} beaches of Penang Island form the northwestern fringes of George Town. The central hills of Penang Island, including Penang Hill, serve as a giant green lung for George Town and an important forested catchment area. While the central hills have somewhat limited the westward urban sprawl, George Town's expansion is more evident southward along the eastern seaboard of Penang Island, creating the suburbs of <b>Jelutong</b> and Gelugor, the latter merging with the northward development of Bayan Lepas.|$|E
25|$|On Penang Island, the Tun Dr Lim Chong Eu Expressway is {{a coastal}} highway that {{runs along the}} eastern coast of the island. It runs between George Town and Batu Maung to the south, passing through the Bayan Lepas Free Industrial Zone and the suburbs of <b>Jelutong</b> and Gelugor; a bypass also links the {{expressway}} with the Penang Bridge. Meanwhile, the Federal Route 6 is a winding trunk road that circles Penang Island, hugging the island's coastline to connect, in clockwise direction, George Town, Bayan Lepas, Balik Pulau and Teluk Bahang.|$|E
500|$|The largest {{model of}} Thunderbird 3, whose design {{was based on}} the Soviet Soyuz rocket, was [...] tall. Thunderbird 4 was {{particularly}} difficult to film: as the scale of the model did not correspond to the water inside the shooting tank, creative camera angles and rapid editing were used to produce a sense of realistic perspective. Thunderbird 5, the most difficult vehicle for Meddings to visualise, {{was based on the}} Tracy Island Round House. Since most of the space station's appearances were provided by stock footage, the model was rarely filmed. Pod Vehicles were designed on an episode-by-episode basis and built from balsa wood, <b>Jelutong</b> wood or fibreglass. To save time and costs, other minor vehicles were built in-house from radio-controlled model kits.|$|E

50|$|Historically, <b>Jelutong</b> Road {{serves as}} the main {{thoroughfare}} within the suburb, allowing motorists from the city centre to head south towards Bayan Lepas.
