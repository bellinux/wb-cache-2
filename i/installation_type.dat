40|$|Summary. In {{operation}} of industrial pyrolysis furnaces, the main task is {{the selection of}} the optimal mode of thermal decomposition of the feedstock, depending on the yield of the desired products under conditions of technological limitations on the process. To solve this problem for an operating reactor, this paper considers the SRT-VI Large-Capacity industrial Furnace, the mathematical model of the pyrolysis process was constructed, using a kinetic scheme which consists of primary reaction of decomposition of raw materials and secondary elementary reactions of interaction of the considered mixture components, the heat balance equation and hydrodynamics of flow in the coil. The raw material for the selected <b>installation</b> <b>type</b> is naphtha (straight-run petrol). Output parameters of the model are the molar costs of marketable hydrocarbons. The reactor is described by the equation of ideal displacement in the static mode of operation. It is assumed that all reactions have a temperature dependence that follows the Arrhenius law. The activation energies of chemical processes were estimated using the PolanyiSemenov equation and identification of pre-exponential factors was carried out using a genetic algorithm (GA). This task requires solving simultaneous system of differential equations describing the pyrolysis process and a search for a large number of unknown parameters, and therefore it is proposed to modify the GA. Optimal scheme includes Gray encoding arithmetic operators, tournament selection, with tournament ranking more than 4, crossover with partial random choice of alleys, mutations with a high probability of occurring and elitism with competitive global competition. Using the proposed approach, the parametric identification of model process is accomplished. The analysis of the simulation results with the data of operating reactor showed its suitability for use in order to control the pyrolysis process...|$|E

40|$|Reinforced {{concrete}} (RC) pipes {{are widely}} used as open channels (non-pressurized pipes) for sewage and storm water conveyance. RC pipes have generally achieved a reliable long-term performance. Depending on multiple parameters (e. g. pipe diameter, pipe wall thickness, required strength, etc.) the pipe may have up to three welded reinforcement cages in order to resist anticipated loads. Each cage is an assembled unit of steel reinforcement consisting of circumferential and longitudinal bars or wires. The fabrication process of a steel cage reinforcement is time and labour consuming. Thus, eliminating the steel cage reinforcement will yield an overall reduction in the production cost of precast concrete pipes. Dispersed steel fibres {{can be an effective}} alternative for the reinforcement of concrete pipes. The aim {{of this study is to}} explore using steel fibres as reinforcement in dry-cast concrete pipes. Mechanical properties of dry-cast steel-fibre reinforced concrete (DCSFRC) fabricated using multiple steel fibre types at various dosages were characterized. Consequently, precast pipes reinforced with Dramix RC- 65 / 35 -CN and Dramix RC- 80 / 60 -CN fibres at various dosages were fabricated. An extensive experimental program was carried out in order to evaluate the structural performance of the full-scale steel fibre-reinforced concrete (SFRC) pipes that were produced in comparison to plain concrete (PC) and RC pipes. Precast pipes had internal diameters of 300, 450, and 600 mm as well as a Type C wall thickness. The structural performance of pipes was characterized using both the continuous and cyclic three-edge-bearing tests (TEBT). Furthermore, the soil-pipe interaction of buried full-scale SFRC pipes was investigated. Finally, a three dimensional non-linear finite element model of the TEBT of SFRC pipes was developed. Subsequently, a parametric study covering multiple pipe configuration and reinforcement parameters was conducted. Results showed that hooked-end fibres with the largest fibre aspect ratio (Dramix RC- 80 / 60 -CN) induced the best flexural performance of DCSFRC specimens while crimped fibres (Novocon XR) were the least effective in enhancing the flexural strength and post-peak behaviour of DCSFRC. The load carrying capacity of SFRC pipes increased with increased fibre dosage. Results of the TEBT for 300 mm diameter pipes showed that the reinforcement specified for Class V pipes in ASTM C 76 “Standard Specification For Reinforced Concrete Culvert, Storm Drain, And Sewer Pipe” could be achieved using a steel fibre dosage of 20 kg/m³, while a fibre dosage of 30 kg/m³ was sufficient for 450 and 600 mm diameter pipes to satisfy the same strength class (Class V). Furthermore, provided using a sufficient fibre dosage, SFRC pipes exhibited higher residual strengths and less deformations than that of RC pipes when subjected to small to moderate loading levels. In addition, results showed that using a hybrid system of short (Dramix RC- 65 / 35 -CN) and long (Dramix RC- 80 / 60 -CN) fibres did not result in synergetic effects. Full-scale testing results of buried SFRC pipes indicated that the pipes could sustain live loads consisting of a fully loaded 625 CL Standard Ontario Truck without exhibiting any cracks or significant deformations, even when the pipe was installed in the least quality <b>installation</b> <b>type</b> (Type IV). This indicated that the current design recommendations for the pipe wall thickness in ASTM C 76 (Type C wall) are overly conservative. Furthermore, it was found that the post-cracking behaviour of buried SFRC pipes was more sensitive to the <b>installation</b> <b>type</b> than to the type of steel fibre reinforcement. Finally, the findings of the parametric study were presented in a tabular form that can be used as a design aid supplementary to the newly released ASTM C 1765 “Standard Specification for Steel Fiber Reinforced Concrete Culvert, Storm Drain, and Sewer Pipe”. The experimental findings of this study should assist the precast concrete industry in producing more economical SFRC pipe without the need for costly and time consuming welded steel cage reinforcement. The numerical and analytical study findings provided a simple and rational tool for the design of such SFRC pipes...|$|E

At present IZTECH Campus has individual fuel boiler heating systems for each faculty building and the Campus is still under development. But the Campus has also a geothermal source. In 2002, 5 gradient wells were drilled. Of these, one well has a geothermal fluid of 33 Â°C is obtained but the actual flowrate of the geothermal fluid has not been measured yet. The aim of this Thesis is to investigate this source whether {{it can be used}} for district heating application for IZTECH Campus. Mainly two heating system types have been considered;. Heat pump heating system (HPHS) (using a renewable energy source, geothermal energy),. Fuel boiler heating system (FBHS) (using a conventional energy source, fuel-oil). HPHS is considered as HPO type since the existing geothermal fluid temperature is low. While HPHS is considered only as district, FBHS is considered as district and individual. Each heating system is simulated using hourly outdoor temperature data. For these heating simulations, the main control parameter is the indoor temperature of the buildings. Mathematical models are derived using Matlab [16] and EES [17] programs. Various heating regime alternatives have been studied for HPHS for the various condenser outlet temperature and geothermal fluid flowrate. Consequently, the heating regime with 35 Â°C condenser inlet and 45 Â°C condenser outlet temperature with 120 kg/s geothermal fluid flowrate considered to be the best option. FBHSs are also simulated for various boiler set temperatures. Boiler set emperatures have been recommended by Demirdöküm [39], is the best alternative with the least fuel consumption and best indoor temperature around 20 Â°C. Besides heating system simulations, piping network simulation is made using the software Pipelab [18]. The piping network of the Campus has been considered with two loops as geothermal and Campus. Each loop contains supply and return main. The location of the heat centre and the pressure loss per unit length are common design parameters for economy of the system. Therefore, several alternatives have been studied and because of the lowest investment and operational cost, Alternative 3, where the heat centre {{is in the middle of}} the Campus, is considered to be the best option with target pressure loss of 150 Pa/m. For <b>installation</b> <b>type</b> of piping network, underground (buried) pipeline installation is selected. Furthermore, economic analysis has also been done for each heating system alternative depending on investment and operational costs. For operational cost, 3 heating scenarios are considered depending on the heating period of the buildings in the Campus. According to the results of economical analyses, while heat pump district heating system (HPDHS) has the biggest investment cost with 3, 040, 125 US$, it has minimum operational cost. The alternatives are evaluated according to internal rate of return (IRR) method, which shows the profit of the investment. The results indicate that, the HPDHS has minimum 3. 02 % profit according to the fuel boiler district heating system (FBDHS) at the end of the 20 -year period. The profit increases with increasing operating period of the heating systems...|$|E

40|$|Adverse {{health effects}} of human {{exposure}} to particulate matter (PM) in indoor environments and the associated costs have been of interest in recent studies conducted outside Canada. It was, therefore, necessary to investigate these effects in a Canadian environment. This study investigated the effects of building construction and Heating, Ventilation, and Air Conditioning (HVAC) systems on the indoor concentration of airborne PM of outdoor origin and the related health impacts and cost savings in Ontario. Due {{to the complexity of}} the investigation, the study has been limited to the metropolitan areas of Toronto and Hamilton which represent much of the population of Ontario and a significant portion of all Canada. The main objective of the cost-benefit analysis (CBA) was to analyze and evaluate the effects of pollution in monetary equivalents. The modeling integrated the various models using the Impact Pathway Approach. The approach consisted of four steps: First, identify the sources and emissions of PM. Although the study focused on indoor environments, outdoor sources such as incomplete combustion from rush hour traffic were identified for the geographical areas of the study. Secondly, evaluate the dispersion or the concentration of PM on the site of interest. In order to achieve this goal, building modeling was first established that was applicable to Ontario. There were three homes and two commercial building scenarios: Existing homes (resExist), new homes constructed under minimum building code requirements (resBC), and under R 2000 standard (resR 2000); commercial buildings with 40 % (school 40) and 85 % (school 85) ASHRAE air filters. Air flow rates were calculated from building and HVAC sizing calculations. These flow rates were used to calculate input parameters for well-established mass balanced indoor PM concentration models. In addition, indoor exposure needed to account for time activity in each micro-environment in Ontario. This was accomplished by using time-weighted exposure modeling. Thirdly and lastly in the Impact Pathway Approach, evaluate the health impact and its monetary equivalent, respectively. In order to evaluate the health effects and monetary equivalents, the study considered fourteen retrofit cases which consisted of improving factors such as building construction, distribution system, and air filtration efficiency. Because input parameters were selected from data applicable to Ontario, the study provided a model setup that could be applied to future work in Canada. The study demonstrated that Canadian building construction provided significant protection from time-weighted PM exposure (Toronto, ambient vs. resExist/school 40 win, PM 2. 5 10. 00 vs. 4. 20 μg/m 3). For this scenario, the prevented attributable number of cases (ANCs) was 721 for Toronto related to equivalent PM 10. Cost savings due to building envelope protection of mortality alone much outweighed costs in investment scenario for new home construction (Toronto, $ 1, 671 million vs. $ 21. 6 million). Therefore, recommendations were made to invest in home construction. Similarly, the morbidity effects were very significant, especially for chronic bronchitis endpoints which were along the same magnitude as mortality for most of the cases. Similar results were obtained for Hamilton in proportion to their relative population at risk. In addition, Canadian building construction and HVAC systems showed larger time-weighted PM exposure in the summer compared to the winter conditions due to the various HVAC operating conditions such as air flow rates (Toronto, resExist/school 40 sum, PM 2. 5 5. 18 μg/m 3; resExist/school 40 win, PM 2. 5 4. 20 μg/m 3). Furthermore, cost savings from retrofits from existing home to forced air with air filtration were very significant. It was demonstrated that the cost savings related to reduction of equivalent PM 10 exposure due to mortality alone much outweighed costs in retrofit investment scenarios (R 2000, Toronto, $ 574 million vs. $ 4. 96 million). Therefore, the government would be wise to promote more energy efficient homes by offering more incentive programs. Factors such as wall insulation, air flow rate changes of less than 600 cfm, and HRV <b>installation</b> <b>type</b> did not played a major role. In addition, the effect of air filtration was more intense in homes compared to commercial buildings. Similarly, the impact of simultaneously retrofitting both, homes and commercial buildings, where children and adults spent most of the daily activities produced the greatest reduction of outdoor PM exposure. Installing high efficient air filtration in both homes and commercial buildings resulted in optimal reduced effects. The cost savings from the retrofit due to mortality alone much outweighed the investment scenario costs justifying the retrofit (Toronto, $ 470 million vs. $ 1. 8 million). This demonstrated that PM concentration exposure reduction is a collective effort that needed to be regulated not only in ambient air level but in the work environment and in homes as well. It was identified that results were limited to model assumptions and input parameter data used. Since some of the parameters used, such as ambient PM concentrations, were average values, the results may not represent the exact actual conditions. Nevertheless, they provided a starting point since they were tailored to Ontario. Therefore, this study provided model simulation data that related to the Canadian environment having many factors in common such as weather, building construction, building systems, and government regulations. Therefore, the results are part of useful data for policy decisions as well {{as a starting point for}} future related work...|$|E
