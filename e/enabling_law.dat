A telling perspective {{of how it}} was viewed at the time is contained in the <b>enabling</b> <b>law</b> (Chapter 375 of the Laws of New York, 1910), which described the Pine Bush as [...] "being a territory lying {{to the west of}} the present boundary line of the city and which is in large part waste and unoccupied land, the ownership of which is uncertain." [...] This law authorized Albany to lay out the newly annexed territory into lots and acquire land for a park system to connect the Rensselaer Lake waterworks property to the old city border.|$|E
2500|$|With {{the passage}} of the Eighteenth Amendment to the United States Constitution and the <b>enabling</b> <b>law</b> known as the Volstead Act, the {{enforcement}} of national prohibition after 16 January 1920 fell to the Treasury Department's Bureau of Internal Revenue. Treasury Secretary David F. Houston created a Prohibition Unit within the bureau, but he did not include the Coast Guard in the unit's makeup. Because the Coast Guard was {{not a part of the}} Prohibition Unit and Congress did not appropriate funds for the Coast Guard to use in prohibition enforcement, Reynolds did little to stop liquor importation before 1922. He suggested that if the Prohibition Unit wanted to pay for the crews and costs of operation of nine Coast Guard-operated [...] submarine chasers, that the Coast Guard would then be interested in more enforcement of the prohibition laws. Reynolds requested in his 1923 budget proposals an increase in personnel manning levels of 3,535 officers and men and the acquisition of twenty new cutters, 200 cabin cruisers, and 91 motorboats Congress thought the request was excessive, but did fund twenty destroyers and two minesweepers as well as 223 cabin cruisers, and 100 smaller motorboats with an additional 4,356 officers and men to operate the vessels. The destroyers [...] and minesweepers were surplus World War I Navy vessels and Congress felt that the older vessels could be overhauled cheaper than new cutters. In addition, some of the officers to command the vessels were given temporary promotions, but without an increase in pay and allowances.|$|E

40|$|A {{national}} {{survey was conducted}} to assess the current status and characteristics of state legislation regulating the practice of lay midwives. As of July 1987, 10 states have prohibitory laws, five states have grandmother clauses authorizing practicing midwives under repealed statutes, five states have <b>enabling</b> <b>laws</b> which are not used, and 10 states explicitly permit lay midwives to practice. In the 21 remaining states, {{the legal status of}} midwives is unclear. Much of the enabling legislation restricts midwifery practice often resulting in situations similar to those in states with prohibitory laws. Given the growth of an extensive grassroots movement of lay midwives committed to quality of care, this outcome suggests that 21 states with no legislation may provide better opportunities for midwifery practice than states with <b>enabling</b> <b>laws...</b>|$|R
