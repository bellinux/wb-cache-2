5|$|In {{common with}} most of the Orkney isles, Shapinsay has a bedrock formed from Old Red Sandstone, which is {{approximately}} 400 million years old and was laid down in the Devonian period. These thick deposits accumulated as earlier Silurian rocks, uplifted by the formation of Pangaea, eroded and then deposited into river deltas. The freshwater Lake Orcadie existed on the edges of these eroding mountains, stretching from Shetland to the southern Moray Firth. The composition of Shapinsay is mostly of the Rousay <b>flagstone</b> group from the Lower Middle Devonian, with some Eday <b>flagstone</b> in the southeast formed in wetter conditions during the later Upper Devonian. The latter is regarded as a better quality building material than the former. At Haco's Ness in the south east corner of the island is a small outcrop of amygdaloidal diabase. The island is overlain with a fertile layer of boulder clay formed during the Pleistocene glaciations.|$|E
5|$|The Middle Devonian {{is divided}} into three main groups. The lower part of the sequence, mostly Eifelian in age, is {{dominated}} by lacustrine beds of the lower and upper Stromness Flagstones that were deposited in Lake Orcadie. The later Rousay <b>flagstone</b> formation is found throughout much of the North and South Isles and East Mainland.|$|E
5|$|The palace is a two-storey {{building}} of seven bays, with three gables over alternating bays, {{two of which}} are supported by buttresses. There is an attic beneath the coped gables and surmounted by octagonal chimney stacks. The interior is laid out with a hall, solar and gallery with an undercroft. It has <b>flagstone</b> floors and a 16th-century stone fireplace.|$|E
2500|$|Most of the Old Red Sandstone of Orkney is of Middle Devonian age. The {{lower part}} of the sequence, mostly Eifelian in age, is {{dominated}} by lacustrine beds of the lower and upper Stromness <b>Flagstones</b> that were deposited in Lake Orcadie. The two <b>flagstones</b> sequences are divided by the Sandwick fish bed, equivalent to the Achanarras formation of Caithness, representing an unusually persistent, deep and widespread lake that filled much of the Orcadian Basin. The sequence continues with the Rousay <b>flagstones</b> deposited in a similar lacustrine environment. The <b>flagstones</b> show a marked cyclicity in their sedimentation, with 86 such cycles being counted for the whole sequence. These are interpreted as representing regular climatically driven changes in lake level caused by Milankovitch cyclicity ...|$|R
40|$|A palaeomagnetic survey {{has been}} made of fluviatile red beds and {{lacustrine}} <b>flagstones</b> in the Orcadian Basin. The results from five facies are all different in important respects and this suggests that the palaeomagnetic history is strongly influenced by short-term and long-term diagenetic processes. Red beds from below the Caithness <b>Flagstones</b> retain much of their original magnetization, probably due to the protection of quartz cementation. Red beds from above the Caithness <b>Flagstones</b> have stable magnetizations but they are apparently random in direction. This is because these porous sand-stones were not protected by extensive cement-ation and had a long history of magnetizatio...|$|R

5|$|The {{interior}} of the hotel was finished in redwood with <b>flagstone</b> flooring. The public space included a registration area, a casino, two bars, a coffee shop, a restaurant, various commercial shops and services, and a broadcasting station for K-RAM radio. Guest rooms were located in wings situated behind the main building, surrounding the figure-eight swimming pool. The hotel originally had 300 rooms, each outfitted with air conditioning with individual thermostats.|$|E
5|$|On 7 June 1971, Murphy {{was buried}} with full {{military}} honors at Arlington National Cemetery. In attendance were Ambassador to the U.N. George H.W. Bush, Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland, {{and many of}} the 3rd Infantry Division. Murphy's gravesite is in Section 46, headstone number 46-366-11, located across Memorial Drive from the Amphitheater. A special <b>flagstone</b> walkway was later constructed to accommodate the large number of people who visit to pay their respects. It is the cemetery's second most-visited gravesite, after that of President John F. Kennedy.|$|E

5|$|The Pond Eddy Bridge is a petit {{truss bridge}} {{spanning}} the Delaware River between the hamlet of Pond Eddy in Lumberland, New York and the settlement informally called Pond Eddy in Shohola Township, Pennsylvania. It is accessible from NY 97 in Lumberland on the New York side and two dead-end local roads, <b>Flagstone</b> Road (State Route 1011) and Rosa Road on the Pennsylvania side. The bridge {{was built in}} 1903 by the Oswego Bridge Company to replace an old suspension bridge that had washed away in a flood earlier in the year. It connected the bluestone quarries in Pennsylvania to New York.|$|E
5|$|PennDOT has {{recently}} begun the Route 1011-Pond Eddy Bridge Replacement Project. Route 1011 is the internal designation for <b>Flagstone</b> Road, {{one of the}} two side roads in Pennsylvania along with the bridge. The state has proposed a four-span bridge with three connecting bridge piers, with four side options: replacing the bridge upstream, buying out the 26 residences on the Pennsylvania side, rehabilitating the structure to handle weights of 16-18 tons or maintain the bridge in its current form. Depending on which project is chosen, the estimated start would be in 2013, when the structure reaches its 110th year in use. The entire project would cost $8.5-11 million. Opponents of demolishing the bridge hope that they can find a place to move the bridge, which would cost $500,000, and have the new owners maintain it.|$|E
5|$|Historians {{believe that}} from the {{beginning}} of the bridge's life, it was toll-free for Lumberland residents. Eventually the town leased the bridge out to private individuals, who collected tolls indiscriminately. During times when bridge could not be leased, the town retained control. The tollhouse was later removed and sold. It is now a home. Originally, the settlement of Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side was named <b>Flagstone,</b> but changed to its current name upon construction. Both Pond Eddys expanded rapidly. A new railroad station was created in Pond Eddy on the Pennsylvania side. The riverfront location on the New York side had two stores, a Methodist church, a telegraph office, eighteen homes and a new hotel with a restaurant. The hotel had new owners around the time of the bridge and eventually became a large stop for travelers. The Pond Eddy Bridge served the town of Lumberland well in the late 19th century, but the area's prosperity did not last. The canal went out of business in 1898, after years of competition from railroads. The Erie station on the Pennsylvania had no roads to go anywhere, and the community began to decline. Decker died at 77 years old in 1900, having lived long enough to experience the rise and fall of Pond Eddy.|$|E

A provenance for the <b>flagstones</b> as coming from the trachyte quarries of the Euganean Hills (Veneto region, northern Italy) is suggested by the similarity of both the fundamental mineral assemblage and the major trace element geochemistry. The location of the quarries of the Euganean Hills next to the harbours of the northern Adriatic Sea strongly supports the hypothesis that the Romans carried the <b>flagstones</b> by ship towards the coasts of the central Adriatic Sea...|$|R
