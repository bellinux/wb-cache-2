5|$|In 2005, 42% of all {{households}} and 76% of {{households in the}} top quintile had two or more income earners. As a result, there was a considerable discrepancy between household and personal income. Recent studies, {{such as the one}} conducted by Harvard professor Elizabeth Warren, <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> average American household needs two incomes in order to live what is commonly perceived as a middle-class lifestyle.|$|E
5|$|Recently, an {{analysis}} of nine different methods for preparing A. muscaria for catching flies in Slovenia <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> release of ibotenic acid and muscimol did {{not depend on the}} solvent (milk or water) and that thermal and mechanical processing led to faster extraction of ibotenic acid and muscimol.|$|E

5|$|Sponges were {{traditionally}} {{distributed in}} three classes: calcareous sponges (Calcarea), glass sponges (Hexactinellida) and demosponges (Demospongiae). However, studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Homoscleromorpha, a group thought {{to belong to}} the Demospongiae, is actually phylogenetically well separated. Therefore, they have recently been recognized as the fourth class of sponges.|$|E
5|$|The Kuiper belt was {{initially}} {{thought to be}} the source of the Solar System's ecliptic comets. However, studies of the region since 1992 <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> orbits within the Kuiper belt are relatively stable, and that ecliptic comets originate from the scattered disc, where orbits are generally less stable.|$|E
5|$|The area drained by Pine Island Glacier {{comprises}} about 10% of the West Antarctic Ice Sheet.

5|$|The exact {{cause of}} Tourette's is unknown, {{but it is}} well {{established}} that both genetic and environmental factors are involved. Genetic epidemiology studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> overwhelming majority of cases of Tourette's are inherited, although the exact mode of inheritance is not yet known and no gene has been identified. In other cases, tics are associated with disorders other than Tourette's, a phenomenon known as tourettism.|$|E
5|$|The trans diastereoselectivity {{observed}} {{results from}} the reversibility of the initial addition, allowing equilibration to the favored anti betaine over the syn betaine. Initial addition of the ylide results in a betaine with adjacent charges; density functional theory calculations <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> rate-limiting step is rotation of the central bond into the conformer necessary for backside attack on the sulfonium.|$|E
5|$|A 2015 {{study of}} the necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus found many {{differences}} between them and other diplodocids, and that these variations may <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> necks of Apatosaurus and Brontosaurus were used for intraspecific combat. Various uses for the single claw on the forelimb of sauropods have been proposed. One suggestion {{is that they were}} used for defense, but their shape and size make this unlikely. It was also possible they were for feeding, but the most probable use for the claw was grasping objects such as tree trunks when rearing.|$|E

5|$|Anxiety {{associated}} with depression {{is responsive to}} alprazolam. Clinical studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> effectiveness is limited to 4 months for anxiety disorders. However, the research into antidepressant properties of alprazolam is poor and has only assessed its short-term effects against depression. In one study, some long term, high-dosage users of alprazolam developed reversible depression. In the US, alprazolam is FDA-approved {{for the management of}} anxiety disorders (a condition corresponding most closely to the APA Diagnostic and Statistical Manual DSM-IV-TR diagnosis of generalized anxiety disorder) or the short-term relief of symptoms of anxiety. In the UK, alprazolam is recommended for the short-term treatment (2–4 weeks) of severe acute anxiety.|$|E
5|$|Gravitational {{interaction}} with nearby stars and galactic tides modified cometary orbits {{to make them}} more circular. This explains the nearly spherical shape of the outer Oort cloud. On the other hand, the Hills cloud, which is bound more strongly to the Sun, has not acquired a spherical shape. Recent studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> formation of the Oort cloud is broadly compatible with the hypothesis that the Solar System formed as part of an embedded cluster of 200–400 stars. These early stars likely {{played a role in the}} cloud's formation, since the number of close stellar passages within the cluster was much higher than today, leading to far more frequent perturbations.|$|E
5|$|Laboratory tests <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> human eyeball {{is far too}} rigid to spontaneously change {{shape to}} a degree that would be {{necessary}} to accomplish what Bates described. Exceedingly small changes in axial length of the eyeball (18.6–19.2 micrometres) are caused by the action of the ciliary muscle during accommodation. However, these changes are far too small to account for the necessary changes in focus, producing changes of only −0.036 dioptres.|$|E

5|$|Lava Fork volcano is {{associated}} {{with a small group of}} related volcanoes called the Iskut-Unuk River Cones. This forms part of the much larger Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province, which extends from the Alaska–Yukon border to near the port city of Prince Rupert, British Columbia. Eruptive activity at The Volcano is relatively young compared to most other volcanoes in the Northern Cordilleran Volcanic Province. Geologic studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>The</b> Volcano and its eruptive products were emplaced in the past 400years; this is well after the last glacial period, which ended about 10,000years ago.|$|E
5|$|Molecular studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> current species {{concept for}} H.repandum may need {{revision}} {{as there is}} a poor overlap between morphological and molecular species concepts. Phylogenetic analysis of European specimens, based on internal transcribed spacer and 5.8S DNA sequences, indicates that H.repandum specimens form two distinct clades, whose only consistent morphological distinction is cap size. These genetic differences may indicate the presence of undescribed cryptic species, and that the taxon may currently be undergoing intensive speciation.|$|E
5|$|Noise as {{high volume}} {{is common for}} musicians from {{classical}} orchestras to rock groups as {{they are exposed to}} high decibel ranges. Although some rock musicians experience noise-induced hearing loss from their music, it is still debated as to whether classical musicians are exposed to enough high-intensity sound to cause hearing impairments. Music-induced hearing loss is still a controversial topic for hearing researchers. While some studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> risk for hearing loss increases as music exposure increases, other studies found little to no correlation between the two.|$|E

5|$|Of note, the atrophic {{effects of}} {{glucocorticoids}} {{are not always}} a disadvantage. The treatment of hyperproliferative diseases like psoriasis makes use of this property. SEGRAMs would likely be less effective in such conditions. Recent advances <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> former striving towards a total separation of GR transrepression and transactivation by using SEGRAMs deserves to be nuanced as the anti-inflammatory genes stimulated by GR transactivation, such as GILZ and DUSP1, do seem {{to play an important}} role. Nevertheless, the more selective nature of these SEGRAMs would still reduce the number of GR-mediated side effects, and deserves further clinical testing.|$|E
5|$|Periodically, {{populations of}} horses in {{isolated}} areas are speculated to be relict populations of wild horses, but generally {{have been proven}} to be feral or domestic. For example, the Riwoche horse of Tibet was proposed as such, but testing did not reveal genetic differences from domesticated horses. Similarly, the Sorraia of Portugal was proposed as a direct descendant of the Tarpan based on shared characteristics, but genetic studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> Sorraia is {{more closely related to}} other horse breeds and that the outward similarity is an unreliable measure of relatedness.|$|E
5|$|Tension {{pneumothorax}} {{may also}} occur in {{someone who is}} receiving mechanical ventilation, in which case {{it may be difficult}} to spot as the person is typically receiving sedation; it is often noted because of a sudden deterioration in condition. Recent studies <b>have</b> <b>shown</b> <b>that</b> <b>the</b> development of tension features may not always be as rapid as previously thought. Deviation of the trachea to one side and the presence of raised jugular venous pressure (distended neck veins) are not reliable as clinical signs.|$|E
