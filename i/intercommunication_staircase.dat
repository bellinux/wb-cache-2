5000|$|The U8 {{station was}} also a ghost station during the {{division}} of Berlin from 13 August 1961 to 1 July 1990. The station master offices were also built; these were shifted and walls were removed. The access at Dierksenstra√üe {{had to be made}} accessible again, just like the connecting stairs to the mall and to the platforms of Line E. Other than that, the <b>intercommunication</b> <b>staircase</b> was also built towards Line E so that it goes through the dimly lit platforms. Stainallee was renamed {{a few months after the}} closure of the stairs. In all cases, the metro stations had to be recognizable as such on the surface [...] The U-Bahn logo has been removed in recent years. This station also had to undergo renovation works from 17 May to 30 June 1990 before the full reopening on 1 July 1990.|$|E
