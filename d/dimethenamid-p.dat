50|$|Since {{the mid-1990s}} the {{commercial}} importance of single-enantiomer fine chemicals has increased steadily. They constitute {{about half of}} both existing and developmental drug APIs. In this context, the ability to synthesize chiral molecules has become an important competency. Two types of processes are used, namely the physical separation of the enantiomers and the stereo specific synthesis, using chiral catalysts. Among the latter, enzymes and synthetic BINAP (2,2´-Bis(diphenylphosphino)-1,1´-binaphthyl) types are used most frequently. Large volume (> 103 mtpa) processes using chiral catalysts include the manufacture of the perfume ingredient l-Menthol and Syngenta’s Dual (metolachlor) as well as BASF’s Outlook (<b>dimethenamid-P)</b> herbicides. Examples of originator drugs, which apply asymmetric technology, are AstraZeneca’s Nexium (esomeprazole) and Merck & Co’s Januvia (sitagliptin). The physical separation of chiral mixtures and purification of the desired enantiomer can be achieved either by classical fractional crystallization (having a “low-tech” image but still widely used), carried-out in standard multipurpose equipment or by various types of chromatographical separation, such as standard column, simulated moving-bed (SMB) or supercritical fluid (SCF) techniques. For peptides three main types of methods are used, namely chemical synthesis, extraction from natural substances, and biosynthesis. Chemical synthesis is used for smaller peptides made of up to 30-40 amino acids. One distinguishes between “liquid phase” and “solid phase” synthesis. In the latter, reagents are incorporated in a resin that is contained in a reactor or column. The synthesis sequence starts by attaching the first amino acid to the reactive group of the resin and then adding the remaining amino acids one after the other. In order to ascertain a full selectivity, the amino groups have to be protected in advance. Most developmental peptides are synthesized by this method, which lends itself to automation. As the intermediate products resulting from individual synthetic steps cannot be purified, a virtually 100% selectivity {{is essential for the}} synthesis of larger-peptide molecules. Even at a selectivity of 99% per reaction step, the purity will drop to less than 75% for a dekapeptide (30 steps). Therefore, for industrial quantities of peptides not more than 10-15 amino acid peptides can be made using the solid-phase method. For laboratory quantities, up to 40 are possible. In order to prepare larger peptides, individual fragments are first produced, purified, and then combined to the final molecule by liquid phase synthesis. Thus, for the production of Roche’s anti-AIDS drug Fuzeon (enfuvirtide), three fragments of 10-12 amino acids are first made by solid-phase synthesis and then linked together by liquid-phase synthesis. The preparation of the whole 35 amino acid peptide requires more than 130 individual steps.|$|E

Sorption {{coefficients were}} determined using a batch equilibrium method to evaluate relative differences in binding among the three herbicides. Based on water solubility values, we would have expected the relative order of binding to be <b>dimethenamid-p</b> (1450  mg L− 1 at 20 °C), s-metolachlor (530  mg L− 1 at 20 °C), and pyroxasulfone (3. 49  mg L− 1 at 20 °C) in order of increasing binding. However, when sorption coefficients were calculated, we observed the order of pyroxasulfone = <b>dimethenamid-p</b> s-metolachlor {{in the order of}} increasing binding. The average Kd (sorption coefficient) values were 1. 7, 2. 3, and 4. 0  L kg− 1 for pyroxasulfone, <b>dimethenamid-p,</b> and s-metolachlor, respectively. Although <b>dimethenamid-p</b> has water solubility values that are over 400 times greater than pyroxasulfone, there was no statistical difference in binding between pyroxasulfone and <b>dimethenamid-p.</b> s-Metolachlor binding was statistically greater than both pyroxasulfone and dimethen-amid-p. Across all soil chemical and physical properties, sorption coefficients for all three herbicides were highly and statistically correlated to soil organic matter. Sand and silt were also statistically correlated to binding, although these correlations could be explained by the high correlation of organic matter to these properties.

Populations were collected from sandy fields with (i) a long-term organic cropping system, (ii) a conventional cropping system with maize in the crop rotation or (iii) a conventional cropping system with long-term monocropping of maize. Each cropping system was represented by six E. crus-galli populations. The effectiveness of three foliar-applied maize herbicides (nicosulfuron, cycloxydim and topramezone) and two soil-applied maize herbicides (S-metolachlor and <b>dimethenamid-P)</b> was tested at three doses and two runs. Foliar-applied herbicides were applied at the three true leaves stage. Soil-applied herbicides were applied immediately after sowing.

Wats.) and common waterhemp (Amaranthus rudis Sauer). Spring-post (SP) treatments with residual control of Palmer amaranth and waterhemp were applied in the winter wheat at Feekes 4 and resulted in less than 50 % control of Palmer amaranth and waterhemp {{at the time of}} double crop soybean planting. Pre-harvest treatments were applied two weeks before winter wheat harvest. 2, 4 -D resulted in highly variable Palmer amaranth and waterhemp control whereas flumioxazin resulted in comparable control to PRE treatments that contained paraquat plus a residual herbicide. Excellent Palmer amaranth and waterhemp control was observed at 1 week after planting (WAP) double crop soybean with a preemergence (PRE) paraquat application; however, reduced control of Palmer amaranth and waterhemp was noted at 8 WAP due to extended emergence. Palmer amaranth and waterhemp control was 85 % or greater at 8 WAP for most PRE treatments that included a combination of paraquat plus residual herbicides. PRE treatments that did not include the combination of paraquat and residual herbicides did not provide acceptable control. A second set of field experiments were established in 2015 and 2016 near Manhattan, Hutchinson, and Ottawa to assess residual Palmer amaranth and waterhemp control with very-long-chain-fatty acid (VLFCA) inhibiting herbicides. Acetochlor (non-encapsulated and encapsulated), alachlor, <b>dimethenamid-P,</b> metolachlor, S-metolachlor, and pyroxasulfone as well as the microtubule inhibiting herbicide pendimethalin were applied at three different field use rates (high, middle, and low) based on labeled rate ranges for soybean as PRE treatments in a non-crop scenario after the plot was clean tilled with a field cultivator. The experiment was conducted one time in 2015 and four times in 2016 at two different locations for a total of five site years of data. PRE applications were made June 1, 2015, near Manhattan.

40|$|Graduation date: 2013 Giant reed (Arundo donax L.) is a {{candidate}} to provide feedstock for the Portland General Electric power plant in Boardman, Oregon. Giant reed is a fast perennial grass, producing 23 - 27 metric tons ha⁻¹ of biomass and {{has the ability to}} adapt to diverse environments making it a good candidate for biomass production. This study tested postemergence and preemergence herbicides for controlling weeds in giant reed during the establishment year in which giant reed plants are more sensitive to weed competition. The greenhouse study demonstrated that among the tested herbicides, bromoxynil plus MCPA at 0. 841 kg ai ha⁻¹, nicosulforun at 0. 035 kg ha⁻¹, and <b>dimethenamid-p</b> at 0. 735 kg ha⁻¹ did not injure giant reed. In a field study, preemergence application of <b>dimethenamid-p</b> at 0. 735 kg ha⁻¹ followed by a postemergence application of 2, 4 -D amine at 0. 560 kg ha⁻¹ and a postemergence application of bromoxynil plus MCPA at 0. 841 kg ha⁻¹ did not injure giant reed. The presence of weeds in a field does not always mean that crop yield will be reduced and there are some periods during the growing season when weeds will not cause considerable yield loss. Therefore, predicting a critical period of weed control (CPWC) that includes the best time for weed control in giant reed could improve weed management in the field. The length of the CPWC could be different depending on the level of acceptable yield loss (AYL). Our results are reported for AYL of 5 and 10 %.

A field trial was conducted to identify alternative herbicides for the management of acetyl coenzyme A carboxylase (ACCase) -inhibiting herbicide-resistant smooth barley in field pea. Preplant (PP) soil applications of pyroxasulfone; prosulfocarb plus S-metolachlor; dimethenamid-P; propyzamide; trifluralin alone or with triallate or with diuron; or imazamox applied POST were evaluated for their effectiveness and crop safety. Propyzamide, pyroxasulfone, or imazamox applied POST provided a high level of smooth barley control, did not cause any crop injury, and increased field pea grain or forage yield compared with the nontreated. Furthermore, propyzamide or pyroxasulfone reduced panicle density and seed production in smooth barley, whereas the effectiveness of POST imazamox varied over the two seasons. <b>Dimethenamid-P</b> reduced the impact of smooth barley on field pea yield, but cause stunting, and was less effective than propyzamide, pyroxasulfone, and imazamox in reducing smooth barley seed production.

A field experiment was conducted in a grower’s field infested with GR common ragweed in Gage County, Nebraska, USA in 2015 and 2016. Preplant herbicide programs containing glufosinate, paraquat, 2, 4 -D, <b>dimethenamid-P,</b> cloransulam-methyl, or high rates of flumioxazin plus chlorimuron-ethyl provided 90 – 99 % control of common ragweed at 21 d after treatment (DAT). The aforementioned PP herbicides fb a POST application of glufosinate alone or in tank-mixture with imazethapyr, acetochlor, or S-metolachlor controlled GR common ragweed 84 – 98 % at soybean harvest, reduced common ragweed density (≤ 20 plants m− 2) and biomass by ≥ 93 %, and secured soybean yield 1, 819 – 2, 158 kg ha− 1. The PP fb POST herbicide programs resulted in the highest gross profit margins (US$ 373 –US$ 506) compared to PP alone (US$ 91) or PRE fb POST programs (US$ 158). The results of this study conclude that effective and economical control of GR common ragweed in glufosinate-resistant soybean is achievable with PP fb POST herbicide programs...|$|E
40|$|Directive 2013 / 39 /EU {{amending}} the Environmental Quality Standards Directive 2008 / 105 /EC under the European Water Framework Directive (WFD) has introduced the new “Watch List” monitoring mechanism {{in order to}} collect high-quality Union-wide monitoring data {{for the purpose of}} supporting future prioritisation exercises. Diclofenac, 17 -beta-estradiol, and 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol were identified in Directive 2013 / 39 /EU for inclusion in the 1 st Watch List. The Joint Research Centre (JRC) has been tasked with proposing seven substances as candidates for the completion of the 1 st Watch List and identifying analytical methods for their monitoring. The procedure and criteria used to identify a short-list of substances for possible inclusion in the Watch List is described in the JRC Science and Policy Report “Development of the 1 st Watch List under the Environmental Quality Standards Directive" (Carvalho et al., 2015). EU Member States and stakeholder groups had the opportunity to comment on the proposed substances and on the analytical methods, whose availability was a criterion for the selection of the compounds. The finally proposed 10 (groups of) substances for inclusion in the 1 st Watch List are diclofenac, 17 -beta-estradiol (E 2) and estrone (E 1), 17 -alpha-ethinylestradiol (EE 2), oxadiazon, methiocarb, 2, 6 -ditert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol, tri-allate, neonicotinoid insecticides as a group (imidacloprid, thiacloprid, thiamethoxam, clothianidin, acetamiprid), macrolide antibiotics (erythromycin, clarithromycin, azithromycin), and 2 -ethylhexyl- 4 -methoxycinnamate. Analytical methods for additional substances were searched and investigated because they were among those considered for inclusion in the list, but either did not fulfil all selection criteria, in some cases because enough monitoring data were found to exist already, or were not ranked highly enough. These substances were trichlorfon, cyclododecane, aminotriazole (amitrole), <b>dimethenamid-P,</b> diflufenican, dichlofluanid, formaldehyde, triphenyl phosphate, tolylfluanid, ciprofloxacin, and free cyanide. Little or no information on analytical methods was found for trichlorfon, aminotriazole, cyclododecane, and tolylfluanid. For the other compounds analytical methods are available and published. Some of them have already been analysed in the aquatic environment. The analysis of free cyanide in water is difficult. The available analytical methods do not reach the proposed PNEC value of 0. 26 µg/l. JRC. H. 1 -Water Resource...|$|E
40|$|Common ragweed (Ambrosia artemisiifolia L.) is a {{competitive}} annual broadleaf weed in soybean (Glycine max) production fields throughout North America. The recent confirmation of glyphosate-resistant common ragweed in Nebraska justified {{the need to}} assess the emergence pattern and competitive ability of common ragweed in soybean and to evaluate alternative herbicide programs for effective management. The objectives of this research were to: 1) evaluate the effect of tillage and develop a predictive model for the emergence pattern of common ragweed in Nebraska; 2) model the competitive interaction between soybean and common ragweed as influenced by density and irrigation levels; 3) characterize the growth response of soybean and common ragweed in mixture and monoculture to varying irrigation levels and increasing common ragweed density; and 4) evaluate the efficacy of preplant herbicides followed by glufosinate applied alone or in tank-mixtures for control of glyphosate-resistant common ragweed in glufosinate-resistant soybean. A field study was conducted for three years to evaluate the effect of tillage timing and develop a predictive model for common ragweed emergence in Nebraska. The {{results of this study}} conclude that spring tillage does not stimulate additional emergence; therefore, tillage {{could be used as a}} component of glyphosate-resistant common ragweed management programs in Nebraska. Additionally, thermal time calculations with a temperature base of 3 C can be used to predict emergence (%). A field study was conducted to model the competitive interaction and assess the growth response of soybean and common ragweed as influenced by density and irrigation level. Soybean yield loss was not altered by irrigation amount and the leaf area ratio model at the soybean R 6 growth stage best fit the data. Common ragweed densities of 1, 6, and 12 m─ 1 row resulted in yield losses of 61, 76, and 95 % in 2015 and 25, 39, and 80 % in 2016, respectively. Soybean growth was affected by common ragweed density however soybean demonstrated no plasticity. Common ragweed growth was affected by common ragweed density and irrigation. Common ragweed demonstrated plasticity by altering specific leaf area and biomass partitioning when in competition with soybean. A field study was conducted to evaluate the efficacy of glufosinate-based herbicide programs for season-long control of glyphosate-resistant common ragweed in glufosinate-resistant soybean. The results of this study conclude that glufosinate, paraquat, 2, 4 -D, <b>dimethenamid-P,</b> cloransulam-methyl, or plus chlorimuron ethyl applied preplant (PP) followed by glufosinate applied POST alone or in tank-mixture provided ≥ 84 % control of glyphosate-resistant common ragweed, reduced density to ≤ 20 plants m─ 2, and secured ≥ 1819 kg ha─ 1 soybean yield. Preplant followed by POST resulted in the highest gross profit margins compared to PP alone or PRE followed by POST treatments...|$|E
