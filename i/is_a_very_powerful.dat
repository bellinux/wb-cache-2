25|$|Spatial {{multiplexing}} requires MIMO antenna configuration. In spatial multiplexing, a high-rate {{signal is}} split into multiple lower-rate streams and each stream {{is transmitted from}} a different transmit antenna in the same frequency channel. If these signals arrive at the receiver antenna array with sufficiently different spatial signatures and the receiver has accurate CSI, it can separate these streams into (almost) parallel channels. Spatial multiplexing <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>powerful</b> technique for increasing channel capacity at higher signal-to-noise ratios (SNR). The maximum number of spatial streams {{is limited by the}} lesser of the number of antennas at the transmitter or receiver. Spatial multiplexing can be used without CSI at the transmitter, but can be combined with precoding if CSI is available. Spatial multiplexing can also be used for simultaneous transmission to multiple receivers, known as space-division multiple access or multi-user MIMO, in which case CSI is required at the transmitter. The scheduling of receivers with different spatial signatures allows good separability.|$|E

In mice, lethal venom doses caused lethargy, flaccid paralysis, and convulsions {{in quick succession}} before death. Dogs injected with lethal doses produced symptoms consistent with fatal hypertension and cyanosis observed in human sea snake bite victims.|$|E

2500|$|Veritaserum <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>powerful</b> truth potion. The name [...] "Veritaserum" [...] {{derives from}} the Latin word Veritas, meaning truth.

In Half-Blood Prince, Harry considers using the potion to get Slughorn to reveal his memories about Voldemort, but thinks better of it; and in Deathly Hallows Rita Skeeter uses the potion to extract the story of Dumbledore's childhood from Bathilda Bagshot.

2500|$|Some of the {{characters}} criticise institutional religion. Ruta Skadi, a witch and friend of Lyra's calling for war against the Magisterium in Lyra's world, says that [...] "For all of [...] history... it's tried to suppress and control every natural impulse. And when it can't control them, it cuts them out". Skadi later extends her criticism to all organised religion: [...] "That's what the Church does, and every church is the same: control, destroy, obliterate every good feeling". By {{this part of the}} book, the witches have made reference to how they are treated criminally by the church in their worlds. Mary Malone, one of Pullman's main characters, states that [...] "the Christian religion... <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>powerful</b> and convincing mistake, that's all". Formerly a Catholic nun, she gave up her vows when the experience of falling in love caused her to doubt her faith. Pullman has warned, however, against equating these views with his own, saying of Malone: [...] "Mary is a character in a book. Mary's not me. It's a story, not a treatise, not a sermon or a work of philosophy". [...] In another inversion, the tenet that the Church can absolve a penitent of sin is subverted when the priest selected to assassinate Lyra has built up sufficient penitential credit before attempting to carry out this sin for the Church.|$|E
2500|$|Quatrain 2 {{continues}} with the poet confessing about his journey on finding false love. In line 5, the phrase [...] "looked on truth" [...] {{is used in}} terms that the poet has seen what is true. Scholar Stephen Booth has interpreted the line: [...] "I have seen truth, but I have not properly regarded it." [...] Booth's interpretation gives insight about the poet's disregard for the lover's affection. Line 5 continuing onto line 6 can be interpreted about the poet's journey of promiscuity and finding new lovers. The {{use of the word}} [...] "askance" [...] is used in this case as the poet's disdain with the affairs he has encountered. [...] "Askance and strangely" [...] are used to describe how none of these loves compare to what he had experienced with this young man. The word blenches can be translated into modern English as a flaw. The interpretation of line 7 can mean that these flawed affairs gave me a blink of youth. Booth has multiple interpretations of what this line could possibly mean. His interpretations is that it [...] "rejuvenated [...] and gave [...] another chance to learn by trial and error" [...] or that it [...] "rejuvenated [...] ". The end of this quatrain ends the poets confession of failed attempts of finding the ideal love and starts his confession of love to the young man. The last line <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>very</b> <b>powerful</b> way to end the quatrain and start the next section. [...] "Worse essays" [...] is used in this line to describe the failed [...] "experiments" [...] of the poet. The failed experiments proved that the young man is the best love that he has encountered.|$|E
