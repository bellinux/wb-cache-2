5|$|Located on the {{property}} of Ambler's Texaco Gas Station, {{just north of the}} station, is a 24-foot (7.3 m) by 16 foot (4.9m) wood clad, wooden frame building that once housed a commercial icehouse. Though its exact dates of operation are unknown, it is believed the icehouse was established by a member of Jack Schore's family during the 1930s. While the icehouse was in business, there was a small pond located about 200feet (61m) east of {{the property}}. Operators cut ice from the pond and stored it in the building until sale. After the icehouse ceased operation, a date that is also unknown, the building was used as a storage shed for the gas station. The building features a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> with sawdust stuffed in between the walls to provide insulation. The wooden roof has asphalt shingles. Ambler's Texaco Station listing on the National Register lists the icehouse building as a contributing property.|$|E

25|$|Metal liners may be {{stainless}} steel, aluminum, or {{galvanized iron}} {{and may be}} flexible or rigid pipes. Stainless steel is made in several types and thicknesses. Type 304 is used with firewood, wood pellet fuel, and non-condensing oil appliances, types 316 and 321 with coal, and type AL 29-4C is used with non-condensing gas appliances. Stainless steel liners must have a cap and be insulated if they service solid fuel appliances, but following the manufacturer's instructions carefully. Aluminum and galvanized steel chimneys are known as class A and class B chimneys. Class A are either an insulated, <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> stainless steel pipe or triple wall, air-insulated pipe often known by its genericized trade name Metalbestos. Class B are uninsulated <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> pipes often called B-vent, and are only used to vent non-condensing gas appliances. These may have an aluminum inside layer and galvanized steel outside layer. Condensing boilers do not need a chimney.|$|E
40|$|AbstractWe {{investigate}} {{the possibility of}} localizing various matter fields on the <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> For spin 0 scalar field, massless zero mode can be normalized on the <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> However, for spin 1 vector field, the zero mode is not localized on the <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> In the paper [C. A. S. Almeida, M. M. Ferreira Jr., A. R. Gomes, R. Casana, arXiv: 0901. 3543 [hep-th]], the authors investigated fermion localization on a Bloch brane, especially, they found fermion resonances on the Bloch brane for both chiralities and related their appearance to branes with internal structure. Inspired by their work, for spin 1 / 2 spinor field, we focus our attention mainly on the fermion resonances, and also found fermion resonances for both left-handed fermions and right-handed ones on the <b>double</b> <b>walls,</b> which further supports the arguments presented in the paper [C.

40|$|Stiff wall {{barriers}} can {{be effective}} in reducing the transmission of environmental ground vibration. Up to now, single wall barriers have mostly been studied. In building acoustics, however, <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> are used in order to realize {{a high level of}} sound insulation. In this paper, the potential of using <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> in reducing ground vibration transmission is investigated by means of numerical simulations. Two cases are studied: jet-grout walls and concrete walls in a homogeneous soil with elastic properties representative of a sandy soil. For both cases, the three-dimensional free field response due to a point load is computed using a 2. 5 D finite element methodology. Subsequently, the free field response is computed for a simplified train load. <b>Double</b> jet-grout <b>wall</b> barriers are found to be slightly more effective than single wall barriers, in particular when the thickness of the walls and the intermediate soil matches a quarter Rayleigh wavelength. The largest increase in vibration reduction is found for the area closest to the vibration source, where the vibration levels have the highest values. The performance of concrete wall barriers, however, is mainly determined by the stiffness of the walls, and almost no difference in performance is found for single and <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|In {{building}} acoustical laboratories, {{the sound}} transmission loss of structures is typically measured {{by placing the}} structure in an aperture between two reverberant rooms. It is known that {{the location of the}} specimen in the aperture can affect the results due to the niche - or tunneling - effect. In this paper, a Wave Based Model is used to numerically investigate the tunneling effect in sound transmission loss determination of single and <b>double</b> <b>walls.</b> The field variables (plate displacements and sound pressures) are expanded in terms of structural and acoustic wave functions. The model is validated with experimental results of lightweight single walls. A parametric study for single and double glazing shows that the position of the wall in the opening can significantly influence sound transmission loss below coincidence. As for single walls, the sound transmission loss of <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> is minimal when placed {{in the center of the}} niche opening and maximal for the edge positions. The difference, however, is greater for <b>double</b> <b>walls</b> in the mid-frequency range, where sound transmission is highly dependent on the angle of incidence. status: publishe...|$|R

25|$|The first combat actions {{showed that}} the fuel {{reservoirs}} were prone to explode when the vehicle was hit by an artillery round.

25|$|Except in {{the case}} of some {{submerged}} aquatic plants, the mature pollen grain has a <b>double</b> <b>wall.</b> The vegetative and generative cells are surrounded by a thin delicate wall of unaltered cellulose called the endospore or intine, and a tough resistant outer cuticularized wall composed largely of sporopollenin called the exospore or exine. The exine often bears spines or warts, or is variously sculptured, and the character of the markings is often of value for identifying genus, species, or even cultivar or individual. The spines may be less than a micron in length (spinulus, plural spinuli) referred to as spinulose (scabrate), or longer than a micron (echina, echinae) referred to as echinate.

25|$|When {{refrigeration}} {{first arrived}} (the 19th century) the equipment was initially used to cool cans of milk, which were filled by hand milking. These cans were placed into a cooled water bath {{to remove heat}} and keep them cool until {{they were able to}} be transported to a collection facility. As more automated methods were developed for harvesting milk, hand milking was replaced and, as a result, the milk can was replaced by a bulk milk cooler. 'Ice banks' were the first type of bulk milk cooler. This was a <b>double</b> <b>wall</b> vessel with evaporator coils and water located between the walls at the bottom and sides of the tank. A small refrigeration compressor was used to remove heat from the evaporator coils. Ice eventually builds up around the coils, until it reaches a thickness of about three inches surrounding each pipe, and the cooling system shuts off. When the milking operation starts, only the milk agitator and the water circulation pump, which flows water across the ice and the steel walls of the tank, are needed to reduce the incoming milk to a temperature below 5 degrees.|$|E
25|$|In {{the spring}} of 360, Shapur II staged a {{campaign}} to capture the city of Singara (probably modern Shingar or Sinjar northwest of Mosul). The town fell {{after a few days}} of siege. From Singara, Shapur directed his march almost due northwards, and leaving Nisibis unassailed upon his left, proceeded to attack the strong fort known indifferently as Pinaca (Phaenicha) or Bezabde. This was a position on the east bank of the Tigris, near the point where that river quits the mountains and debouches upon the plain; though not on the site, it may be considered the representative of the modern Jezireh (Cizre in southeastern Turkey), which commands the passes from the low country into the Kurdish mountains. It was much valued by Rome, was fortified in places with a <b>double</b> <b>wall,</b> and was guarded by three legions and a large body of Kurdish archers. Shapur sent a flag of truce to demand a surrender, joining with the messengers some prisoners of high rank taken at Singara, lest the enemy should open fire upon his envoys. The device was successful; but the garrison proved staunch, and determined on resisting to the last. After a long siege, the wall was at last breached, the city taken, and its defenders indiscriminately massacred.|$|E
