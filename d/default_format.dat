When trying to print a document whose paper size is set to [...] "letter" [...] on A4-sized paper the message occurs. The error [...] "PC LOAD A4" [...] appears in countries using this paper size. However, as many (American-written) programs use [...] "letter" [...] as the <b>default</b> <b>format,</b> the confusing message is often encountered by non-American users who are unaware of the recovery procedure (empty print queue and printer buffer or press [...] "Shift/Continue" [...] and in extreme cases, restart printer and repeat). The LaserJet 5 introduced an easy-to-find [...] "GO" [...] button to override the warning message.|$|E

2500|$|The TeX {{system has}} precise {{knowledge}} of the sizes of all characters and symbols, and using this information, it computes the optimal arrangement of letters per line and lines per page. It then produces a DVI file ("DeVice Independent") containing the final locations of all characters. This dvi file can be printed directly given an appropriate printer driver, {{or it can be}} converted to other formats. Nowadays, pdfTeX is often used, which bypasses DVI generation altogether. The base TeX system understands about 300 commands, called primitives. [...] These low-level commands are rarely used directly by users, and most functionality is provided by format files (predumped memory images of TeX after large macro collections have been loaded). Knuth's original <b>default</b> <b>format,</b> which adds about 600 commands, is Plain TeX. [...] The most widely used format is LaTeX, originally developed by Leslie Lamport, which incorporates document styles for books, letters, slides, etc., and adds support for referencing and automatic numbering of sections and equations. Another widely used format, AMS-TeX, is produced by the American Mathematical Society and provides many more user-friendly commands, which can be altered by journals to fit with their house style. Most of the features of AMS-TeX can be used in LaTeX by using the AMS [...] "packages". This is then referred to as AMS-LaTeX. Other formats include ConTeXt, used primarily for desktop publishing and written mostly by Hans Hagen at Pragma.|$|E
