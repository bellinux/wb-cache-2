40|$|We {{conducted}} the first molecular phylogenetic study of Ficus section Malvanthera (Moraceae; subgenus Urostigma) based on 32 Malvanthera accessions and seven outgroups representing other sections of Ficus subgenus Urostigma. We used DNA sequences from the nuclear ribosomal {{internal and external}} transcribed spacers (ITS and ETS), and the glyceraldehyde- 3 -phosphate dehydrogenase (G 3 pdh) region. Phylogenetic analysis using maximum parsimony, maximum likelihood and Bayesian methods recovered a monophyletic section Malvanthera {{to the exclusion of}} the <b>rubber</b> <b>fig,</b> Ficus elastica. The results of the phylogenetic analyses do not conform to any previously proposed taxonomic subdivision of the section and characters used for previous classification are homoplasious. Geographic distribution, however, is highly conserved and Melanesian Malvanthera are monophyletic. A new subdivision of section Malvanthera reflecting phylogenetic relationships is presented. Section Malvanthera likely diversified during a period of isolation in Australia and subsequently colonized New Guinea. Two Australian series are consistent with a pattern of dispersal out of rainforest habitat into drier habitats accompanied by a reduction in plant height during the transition from hemi-epiphytic trees to lithophytic trees and shrubs. In contradiction with a previous study of Pleistodontes phylogeny suggesting multiple changes in pollination behaviour, reconstruction of changes in pollination behaviour on Malvanthera, suggests only one or a few gains of active pollination within the section.

25|$|The {{flexibility}} of rubber is appealing in hoses, tires and rollers for devices ranging from domestic clothes wringers to printing presses; its elasticity makes it suitable for {{various kinds of}} shock absorbers and for specialized machinery mountings designed to reduce vibration.

40|$|Natural rubber was {{extracted}} from the fig tree (Ficus carica) cultivated in Korea {{as part of a}} survey of rubber producing plants. Fourier transform infrared and 13 C nuclear magnetic resonance analysis of samples prepared by successive extraction with acetone and benzene confirmed that the benzene-soluble residues are natural rubber, cis- 1, 4 -polyisoprene. The rubber content in the latex of fig tree was about 4 %, whereas the rubber content in the bark, leaf, and fruit was 0. 3 %, 0. 1 %, and 0. 1 %, respectively. Gel-permeation chromatography revealed that the molecular size of the natural <b>rubber</b> from <b>fig</b> tree is about 190 kD. Similar to rubber tree (Hevea brasiliensis) and guayule (Parthenium argentatum Gray), <b>rubber</b> biosynthesis in <b>fig</b> tree is tightly associated with rubber particles.
