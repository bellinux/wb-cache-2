5|$|The text {{virtually}} ignores {{his wife}} and family, but Cibber wrote in detail about {{his time in the}} theatre, especially his early years as a young actor at Drury Lane in the 1690s, giving a vivid account of the cut-throat theatre company rivalries and chicanery of the time, as well as providing pen portraits of the actors he knew. The Apology is vain and self-serving, as both his contemporaries and later commentators have pointed out, but it also serves as Cibber's rebuttal to his harshest critics, especially Pope. For the early part of Cibber's career, it is unreliable in respect of chronology and other <b>hard</b> <b>facts,</b> understandably, since it was written 50 years after the events, apparently without the help of a journal or notes. Nevertheless, it is an invaluable source for all aspects of the early 18th-century theatre in London, for which documentation is otherwise scanty. Because he worked with many actors from the early days of Restoration theatre, such as Thomas Betterton and Elizabeth Barry {{at the end of their}} careers, and lived to see David Garrick perform, he is a bridge between the earlier mannered and later more naturalistic styles of performance.|$|E
25|$|A Nielsen {{study shows}} {{consumers}} want {{a more personal}} connection {{in the way they}} gather information. Our brains are far more engaged by storytelling than by cold, <b>hard</b> <b>facts.</b> When reading straight data, only the language parts of our brains work to decode the meaning. But when we read a story, not only do the language parts of our brains light up, but any other part of the brain that we would use if we were actually experiencing what we're reading about becomes activated as well. This means it's far easier for us to remember stories than <b>hard</b> <b>facts.</b>|$|E

25|$|The most {{important}} historical source on Sverre’s life is his biography, Sverris saga, in part written while Sverre was alive. This saga is likely biased, since the foreword states that part was written under Sverre’s direct sponsorship.

The saga and the letters mostly agree about the <b>hard</b> <b>facts.</b>|$|E

The first edition was titled Psychology: a Factual Textbook and was published in 1935. This textbook focused mainly on the <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> and each section was written by a specialist in the field of focus for that chapter. In 1939 the text was much revised and a second edition was published. The third edition published in 1948 was renamed Foundations of Psychology and it was greatly expanded to include new authors, chapters, and format.|$|E

25|$|The Hall of Fame... {{owes its}} {{inception}} {{in large part to}} <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> of physical geography. After the three buildings which were to form {{the west side of the}} quadrangle of the New York University College of Arts and Science at University Heights had been planned, it was decided, in order to enlarge the quadrangle, to push them as near as possible to the avenue above the Harlem River. But since the campus level is 170 feet above high tide, and from 40 to 60 feet above the avenue, it was seen at once that the basement stories would stand out towards the avenue bare and unsightly. In order to conceal their walls, a terrace was suggested by the architect, to be bounded at its outer edge by a parapet or colonnade.|$|E
25|$|The wave {{of direct}} action spread to Alberta when Premier Peter Lougheed and his Conservatives won power in 1971, ending 36 years of Social Credit rule. Lougheed's {{elaborate}} election platform, titled New Directions, sounded themes common among OPEC countries by pledging to create provincial resources and oil growth companies, collect {{a greater share}} of energy revenues, and foster economic diversification to prepare for the day when petroleum reserves ran out. The idea of limited resources emerged from the realm of theory into <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> of policy when the NEB rejected natural-gas export applications in 1970 and 1971, on grounds that there was no surplus and Canada needed the supplies. The strength of the new conservationist sentiment was underlined when the NEB stuck to its guns despite a 1971 declaration by the federal Department of Energy that it thought Canada had a 392-year supply of natural gas and enough oil for 923 years.|$|E
25|$|Finally, {{anger in}} {{infidelity}} is quite inevitable. In the initial stage of infidelity anger {{is not as}} apparent as it is seen in stage two, because there is not <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> or evidence supporting one’s suspicions. Like previously talked about the accuser most likely feels jealous and incompetent {{in the first stage}} of cheating. These emotions can contract into anger and provide a cognitive state of anger, because the accusing person anticipates his or her anger. Unlike jealousy and resentment, it is hard to identify the purpose or cause of the individual’s anger because in reality there is nothing yet to be angry about, there is no proof of their romantic partner’s unfaithfulness. 25% of people surveyed felt angry in the beginning or suspicion stage of infidelity (Johnson, 2017). It is hard to pinpoint the anger emotion in the initial stages due to ambiguity; therefore, it begins to take on other emotions turning into a cognitive state of emotional turmoil. The individual knows they are angry and anticipates it, but cannot logically explain it to their partner {{because of the lack of}} evidence they have.|$|E

25|$|William Shakespeare was an actor, playwright, poet, and theatre {{entrepreneur}} in London {{during the}} late Elizabethan and early Jacobean eras. He was baptised on 26 April 1564 in Stratford-upon-Avon in Warwickshire, England, in the Holy Trinity Church. At age 18 he married Anne Hathaway {{with whom he had}} three children. He died in his home town of Stratford on 23 April 1616 at the age of 52. Though more is known about Shakespeare's life than those of most other Elizabethan and Jacobean writers, few personal biographical facts survive about him, which is unsurprising in the light of his social status as a commoner, the low esteem in which his profession was held, and the general lack of interest of the time in the personal lives of writers. Information about his life derives from public instead of private documents: vital records, real estate and tax records, lawsuits, records of payments, and references to Shakespeare and his works in printed and hand-written texts. Nevertheless, hundreds of biographies have been written and more continue to be, most of which rely on inferences and the historical context of the 70 or so <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> recorded about Shakespeare the man, a technique that sometimes leads to embellishment or unwarranted interpretation of the documented record.|$|E
500|$|These set {{the model}} for flash fiction– fiction that is {{condensed}} without unnecessary descriptive detail. In A Moveable Feast Hemingway wrote that [...] "Out of Season", written in 1924, was the first story where he applied the theory of omission, known as his Iceberg Theory. He explained that the stories in which he left out the most important parts, such as not writing {{about the war in}} [...] "Big Two-Hearted River", are the best of his early fiction. As Carlos Baker describes the technique, the <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Hemingway wrote in the preface to Death in the Afternoon, a writer may choose what to include and what to omit from a story.|$|E
500|$|Hemingway biographer Carlos Baker {{writes that}} Hemingway {{learned from his}} short stories how to [...] "get the most from the least, how to prune language, how to {{multiply}} intensities, and how to tell {{nothing but the truth}} in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". The style has become known as the iceberg theory, because, as Baker describes it, in Hemingway's writing the <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight. Benson believes Hemingway used autobiographical details as framing devices to write about life in general—not only his life. The concept of the iceberg theory is sometimes referred to as the [...] "theory of omission". Hemingway believed the writer could describe one thing though an entirely different thing occurs below the surface.|$|E

60|$|Let {{me point}} out that this is no sentimental or mystical statement. It is <b>hard</b> <b>fact</b> as any <b>hard</b> <b>fact</b> we know. We, you and I, are not only parts in a thought process, but parts of one flow of blood and life. Let me put that in a way that may be new to some readers. Let me remind you of what is {{sometimes}} told as a jest, the fact that the number of one's ancestors increases as we look back in time. Disregarding the chances of intermarriage, each one of us had two parents, four grandparents, eight great-grandparents, and so on backward, until very soon, in less than fifty generations, we should find that, but for the qualification introduced, we should have all the earth's inhabitants of that time as our progenitors. For a hundred generations it must hold absolutely true, that everyone of that time who has issue living now is ancestral to all of us. That brings the thing quite within the historical period. There is not a western European palaeolithic or neolithic relic that is not a family relic for every soul alive. The blood in our veins has handled it.|$|R
60|$|The <b>hard</b> <b>fact</b> is {{that there}} are more idle hands than there is work for them to do, even where honest and capable folk are concerned.

Of course, of such jobs there are not enough to go round, so many poor folk must be sent empty away or supported by charity.|$|R
500|$|Hemingway was {{inspired}} by Ezra Pound's writings and applied the principles of imagism to his own work. Pound's influence {{can be seen in}} the stripped-down, minimalist style [...] characteristic in Hemingway's early fiction. Betraying his admiration for the older writer, he admitted that Pound [...] "taught [...] more about how to write and how not to write than any son of a bitch alive". He also learned from James Joyce, who further instilled the idea of stripped down economic prose. Hemingway's short stories from the 1920s adhere to Pound's tight definition of imagism; biographer Carlos Baker writes that in his short stories Hemingway tried to learn how to [...] "get the most from the least, [...] prune language, [...] multiply intensities, [...] tell nothing but the truth in a way that allowed for telling more than the truth". Hemingway adapted this style into a technique he called his iceberg theory: as Baker describes it, the <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> float above water while the supporting structure, including the symbolism, operates out of sight.|$|E
500|$|Satin {{presents}} Radical Middle as {{a revised}} and evolved {{version of his}} New Age Politics book, {{rather than as a}} rejection of it. [...] Some observers had always seen him as a radical centrist. [...] As early as 1980, author Marilyn Ferguson identified him as part of what she called the [...] "Radical Center". [...] In 1987, culture critic Annie Gottlieb said Satin was trying to prompt the New Age and New Left to evolve into a [...] "New Center". [...] But the revisions Satin introduces are substantial. [...] Instead of defining politics as a means for creating the ideal society, as he did in New Age Politics, he defines radical middle politics as [...] "idealism without illusions"– more creative and future-oriented than politics-as-usual, but willing to face [...] "the <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> on the ground". [...] Rather than arguing that change will be brought about by a third force, he says most Americans are already radical middle– [...] "we're very practical folks, and we're very idealistic and visionary as well." ...|$|E
500|$|While {{he enjoyed}} {{enthusiastic}} {{support from the}} conservative movement, Goldwater was opposed by liberals and moderates in the party, particularly New York Governor Nelson Rockefeller, who was also speculated to run for president. He cast Goldwater as an opponent of civil rights and an isolationist who wanted {{to withdraw from the}} United Nations. He vowed to stop Goldwater from running, [...] "at all costs". There were concerns that Goldwater and the more moderate Rockefeller could divide the Republican party, harming the its chances of winning the general election. Goldwater was the perceived leader of a grassroots movement in the American southern, southwestern, and western states staged by the more conservative wing of the party. Rockefeller, on the other hand, disagreed with most of the fiscal and social positions held by Goldwater, advocating a more progressive, mainstream approach to government for the Republican platform. News of Rockefeller's marriage in May 1963, eighteen months after he divorced his first wife, to a woman with whom he'd had a relationship for over five years spread quickly throughout the nation. Initially, Rockefeller's divorce received little media fanfare; however, news of his remarriage prompted a considerably negative reaction among many. Rockefeller, who had been leading in the polls over other Republican candidates by a comfortable margin just weeks previously, saw a significant decrease in support for his candidacy. In July 1963, he made an attempt to regain lost support by taking aim at what he viewed as [...] "extremist groups," [...] targeting Goldwater specifically. Goldwater responded by accusing Rockefeller of blurring the line separating the Republican and Democratic parties. In attacking Goldwater's politics and advocating his own, more progressive agenda, Rockefeller said to voters [...] "Americans will not and should not respond to a political creed that cherishes the past solely because it offers an excuse for shutting out the <b>hard</b> <b>facts</b> and difficult tasks of the present." ...|$|E
50|$|Gracchan Annalist {{seems to}} refer to the writers of history in annalistic form who began writing after the time of the Gracchi. Compared to other forms of annalistic history, these seem more fictionalized as Roman historians used their {{histories}} to illustrate points about their own time, and were not necessarily out to produce <b>hard</b> <b>fact.</b> Still, Gracchan annalists have produced interesting insight into the writer’s own time, if not necessarily into the time on which they wrote. Sallust and Tacitus are fair examples of Gracchan Annalists.|$|R
