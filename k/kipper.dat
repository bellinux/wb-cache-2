5|$|The {{composing}} {{debut of}} Richard Elfman's younger brother Danny, the film stars Hervé Villechaize, Susan Tyrrell {{and members of}} the Mystic Knights of the Oingo Boingo, and features appearances by Warhol Superstar Viva, Joe Spinell and The <b>Kipper</b> Kids. Villechaize kicked his cheque back into the production and even painted sets on weekends. The only actual paid actor was Phil Gordon, who played Flash; all the other SAG actors kicked their cheques back into the show.|$|E
5|$|Salt {{is present}} in most foods, but in {{naturally}} occurring foodstuffs such as meats, vegetables and fruit, it {{is present in}} very small quantities. It is often added to processed foods (such as canned foods and especially salted foods, pickled foods, and snack foods or other convenience foods), where it functions as both a preservative and a flavoring. Dairy salt {{is used in the}} preparation of butter and cheese products. Before the advent of electrically powered refrigeration, salting {{was one of the main}} methods of food preservation. Thus, herring contains 67mg sodium per 100g, while <b>kipper,</b> its preserved form, contains 990mg. Similarly, pork typically contains 63mg while bacon contains 1,480mg, and potatoes contain 7mg but potato crisps 800mg per 100 g. The main sources of salt in the diet, apart from direct use of sodium chloride, are bread and cereal products, meat products and milk and dairy products.|$|E

50|$|Mallaig, {{once the}} busiest herring port in Europe, {{is famous for}} its {{traditionally}} smoked <b>kippers,</b> as well as Stornoway <b>kippers</b> and Loch Fyne <b>kippers.</b> The harbour village of Craster in Northumberland is famed for Craster <b>kippers,</b> which are prepared in a local smokehouse, sold in the village shop and exported around the world.|$|R
25|$|There was {{a similar}} {{disagreement}} between the PDU and Bukovina's Germans. The Romanian party claimed {{that it had}} supported {{the creation of a}} German constituency, but that the Germans, being spread out between villages, were ungroupable. The National German Council, resentful of early Romanianization attempts, refused to sign for an alliance with Nistor. In this case as well, the PDU was able to enlist a dissident German, Norbert <b>Kipper</b> (Chiper), among its own candidates for the Assembly. The party was even able to affiliate two Ukrainians, Vasily Snyatynchuk of Orășeni (Coțmani) and the Mayor of Ocna. Stanisław (Stanislaus) Kwiatkowski, the first Bukovina Pole to serve in Parliament, was also close to Nistor and, after taking his seat, became a PDU member.|$|E
25|$|Men's {{business}} attire saw {{a return}} of pinstripes {{for the first time}} since the 1970s. The new pinstripes were much wider than in 1930s and 1940s suits but were similar to the 1970s styles. Three-piece suits began their decline in the early 1980s and lapels on suits became very narrow, akin to that of the early 1960s. While vests (waistcoats) in the 1970s had commonly been worn high with six or five buttons, those made in the early 1980s often had only four buttons and were made to be worn low. The thin ties briefly popular in the early '80s were soon replaced by wider, striped neckties, generally in more conservative colors than the <b>kipper</b> ties of the '70s. Double breasted suits inspired by the 1940s were reintroduced in the 1980s by designers like Giorgio Armani, Ralph Lauren, and Anne Klein. They were known as 'power suits', and were typically made in navy blue, charcoal grey or air force blue.|$|E

500|$|Actor Hervé Villechaize was {{a former}} roommate of co-writer and co-star Matthew Bright, Villechaize had {{previously}} dated co-star Susan Tyrrell, but the two had already broken up by the time production on the film began. According to Richard Elfman, Tyrrell and Villechaize fought periodically throughout the production. The Elfmans' grandfather, Herman Bernstein, also appeared in the film, and Richard Elfman's accountant appeared under the name [...] "Hyman Diamond" [...] because Elfman had no idea {{whether or not he}} wanted to be credited.

500|$|The Astros invited Bagwell {{to major}} league camp in spring {{training}} of 1991. [...] Bagwell, expecting for the club to assign him to their AAA affiliate Tucson, enthused them with his play. [...] Because they, too, already had an established major leaguer at third base in Ken Caminiti, they approached Bagwell about shifting to first base, which he accepted. [...] Having not previously played the position as a regular, Bagwell received a crash course, playing minor league games {{in the morning and}} Astros games in the afternoon until Opening Day. [...] Observed The Sporting News: [...] "Rookie Jeff Bagwell never played first base before this spring, but the position is his to lose. [...] It's up to his bat." [...] Thus, Bagwell made the major league club without an assignment to AAA, making the uncommon jump from AA to the major leagues, and made his major league debut on Opening Day. [...] On May 6, he hit the ninth-ever upper-deck home run at Three Rivers Stadium off Bob <b>Kipper</b> in a seventh-inning pinch hit appearance, estimated at [...] [...] Bagwell hit [...]350 in September.

With the increased use of the idiomatic expression [...] "red herring", references to the smoked fish product in this manner declined.

Other smoked fish products from the UK include Finnan Haddie and Bloater.|$|R
