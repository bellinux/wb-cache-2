5|$|Nevertheless, some Han {{literary}} sources provide crucial information. As {{written by}} Yang Xiong in 15 BCE, the belt <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> first {{used for a}} quilling device which wound silk fibers onto the bobbins of weaver shuttles.

5|$|Skyline <b>Drive</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} {{lined with}} miles of chestnut log guardrails. However, the guardrails rotted and were removed in the 1950s and not replaced. The Marys Rock Tunnel was partially lined with concrete in 1958 to prevent icicles {{in the winter}} and water seepage in the summer. In 1983, the Federal Highway Administration began work to replace several of the original stone walls on the drive with concrete walls that used the original stone as a veneer. The road was added to the National Register of Historic Places on April 28, 1997. On September 22, 2005, Skyline <b>Drive</b> <b>was</b> designated a National Scenic Byway. Skyline <b>Drive</b> <b>was</b> designated a National Historic Landmark in October 2008 for its pioneering place in the development of national parks in the eastern United States.|$|E

After Red Dogs release date was pushed up by several days, Drive replaced it as the Melbourne International Film Festival's closing night film. The film was also screened during FilmDistrict's studio panel presentation at the San Diego Comic-Con function.

A <b>drive</b> <b>is</b> a demand that is not caught up in the dialectical mediation of desire; <b>drive</b> <b>is</b> a [...] "mechanical" [...] insistence that is not ensnared in demand's dialectical mediation.|$|R

50|$|According to such theorists as Clark Hull and Kenneth Spence, <b>drive</b> {{reduction}} <b>is</b> a {{major cause}} of learning and behavior. Primary <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> innate <b>drives</b> (e.g. thirst, hunger, and sex), whereas secondary <b>drives</b> <b>are</b> learned by conditioning (e.g. money). Doris Kraeling and Byron Campbell experimented to determine if “reduction would be more effective as a reinforcer if the initial <b>drive</b> <b>were</b> low than if the initial <b>drive</b> <b>were</b> high.” Their findings are quite surprising: “Changes in stimuli are more discriminable at low levels of stimulus intensity than at higher levels of stimulus intensity”.|$|R

Running back David Wilson returned the opening kickoff to the Tech 21-yard line, and the Hokies' offense began the first drive of the second half. The first play of the quarter was a 14-yard pass from Taylor to Coale, beginning a seven-play, 67-yard drive resulting in a touchdown. The culminating play of the <b>drive</b> <b>was</b> a 45-yard pass from Taylor to Coale for the touchdown, which extended Tech's lead to 11 points, 28–17, at the 11:24 mark of the quarter.|$|E
5|$|By 1963, when President John F.

5|$|Sheridan <b>Drive</b> <b>was</b> {{constructed}} {{during the}} early1920s as {{a town of}} Tonawanda project to help alleviate the anticipated growth of the village of Kenmore.

The town also felt that {{the construction of a}} superhighway {{in the middle of the}} country in Tonawanda was unjustified with the average traffic in that area. After construction of Sheridan <b>Drive</b> <b>was</b> completed in 1925, a monument with a statue of General Phillip Sheridan was constructed to commemorate the new road. However, the taxpayers feeling enough money had already been spent on the road, the statue of Sheridan was never constructed and only the monument to the road's construction was completed. In order to give the road a new look, the road had large trees planted throughout what was considered a desolate area at the time.|$|E
