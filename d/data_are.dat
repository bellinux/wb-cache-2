If a form exists but <b>is</b> non-calculable, the <b>data</b> <b>is</b> {{classified as}} semi-structured <b>data.</b> Unstructured <b>data</b> <b>is</b> <b>data</b> that neither has form nor is calculable. In order to analyze unstructured data, additional formalization work is required [13 – 15].|$|R

It is helpful when petroglyphs are associated with existing peoples. This allows ethnoastronomers to question informants as to the meaning of such symbols.|$|E
