Commentators suggested at the time that they represented the possibility of a change in the way in which new bands are promoted and marketed.

From early 2007 to January 2008 Odex took action against {{anyone who had}} downloaded anime through BitTorrent for alleged copyright infringement. Odex tracked their IP addresses without their consent and sought subpoenas to compel the ISPs to disclose the personal details of these subscribers. After rulings from the Subordinate Courts, Odex took personal data from affected ISPs and sent letters demanding payment in place of litigation. More {{than a third of}} the individuals contacted by Odex opted to settle out of court for at least S$3,000 (US$2,000) to S$5,000 (US$4,000) each.|$|E

TorrentFreak estimated that The Interview had been downloaded illegally via torrents at least 1.5 million times in just two days. On December 27, the North Korean National Defence Commission released a statement accusing President Obama of forcing Sony to distribute the film. The film was released on iTunes on December 28.|$|E
5|$|St. Anger is {{the eighth}} studio album by American heavy metal band Metallica, {{released}} on June 5, 2003, by Elektra Records. It was the band's last album released through Elektra, and the second-longest timespan between studio albums from Metallica, with nearly six {{years between the}} release of Reload and this album. It is also the final collaboration between Metallica and producer Bob Rock, whose relationship began with the band's fifth studio album, 1991's Metallica. St. Anger was originally intended for release on June 10, 2003, but was released five days earlier due to concerns over unlicensed distribution through peer-to-peer <b>file</b> <b>sharing</b> networks. The St. Anger sessions also mark the only time Rock played when the music was being recorded, filling in for the departed bassist Jason Newsted.|$|E

First week sales of the album were 417,000 copies, and it debuted at number 1 on the U.S. Billboard 200, as well as in 30 other countries around the world.

5|$|Wilco {{had planned}} on {{releasing}} Yankee Hotel Foxtrot on September 11, 2001, but Tweedy {{did not want}} a change in record labels to significantly delay {{the release of the}} album. Within weeks of being released from the label and Jay Bennett leaving the band, MP3s of all tracks from the album began to appear on <b>file</b> <b>sharing</b> networks. In a decision aimed at discouraging the downloading of lower quality unlicensed MP3s and having some control over how the album was distributed, on September 18, 2001, Wilco began streaming the entirety of the album on their official website. The wilcoworld.net website registered over 50,000 hits that day, eight times as much as typical daily traffic. Traffic to the website quadrupled the normal traffic over the next few months. The following tour was a success financially, and members of Wilco observed that fans sang along with unreleased songs from the album.|$|E

5|$|The Singaporean anime {{community}} considered Odex's {{actions to}} be controversial, sudden, and heavy-handed—especially {{when it was}} discovered that the youngest person threatened was nine years old. In response, Odex dropped its pay-or-be-sued letter approach in favour of cease-and-desist emails to downloaders. Odex halted active enforcement after its third subpoena was rejected by the courts and lost a lawsuit when trying to obtain customer data from another ISP. In January 2008, Odex appealed the decision, and the High Court of Singapore ruled that one ISP was required to release data, but only directly to Japanese anime studios. Subsequently, these studios started their own legal actions against Singaporean downloaders. Some observers predicted that the High Court's decision would set a precedent for online privacy in Singapore by making it more difficult for copyright licensees to take legal action against downloading. The case raised issues of individual privacy, intellectual property, and free use of the Internet. Odex's actions attracted widespread criticism in Singapore and international attention and press coverage, which coincided with similar actions against consumer <b>file</b> <b>sharing</b> of music in the United States.|$|E
