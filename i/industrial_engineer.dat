He was drawn to music at a young age, his first musical {{interests}} developed with classical and jazz influences. His musical odyssey started with an electric guitar he built using a cheap Stella guitar, a Sears amplifier and a low-quality Astatic microphone. Along with learning guitar, Livgren also focused on learning to write songs due to his desire for more creative expression and originality. He attended Washburn University for some time.|$|E

From 1973 to 1979, he served the Society for Computer Simulation as the SIMULATION journal's area editor for combined discrete-continuous simulation. Elected to the National Academy of Engineering in 1985, Alan Pritsker enjoyed the distinction of being the second <b>industrial</b> <b>engineer</b> to join that organization. For over fifteen years, he actively served the National Academy of Engineering in many positions of great responsibility. By his leadership in these various professional societies and governmental organizations over the past forty-five years, Alan Pritsker contributed significantly to the dramatic growth of the field of simulation as well as the larger fields of industrial engineering and operations research.|$|E

40|$|The {{industrial}} engineering discipline in South Africa is examined by introducing {{the context of}} the discipline and by revisiting its history. The drivers influencing the context and future of {{industrial engineering}} in South Africa are also considered, and the discipline is analysed in terms of the following aspects: university qualifications, employment in industry sectors, race and gender profiles, use and competence in industry, and income profiles. The analysis is based on a recent survey sent to practising <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers,</b> on membership data from the Southern African Institute for Industrial Engineering (SAIIE), and on two internal SAIIE investigations. The study concludes that the success of transformation, particularly in terms of race, has been limited. The results also indicate that there are an almost equal number of black and white <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers,</b> yet the majority of black <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers</b> have technical qualifications, while the majority of white <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers</b> have academic qualifications. The results indicate that this limits the use of black <b>industrial</b> <b>engineers</b> in industry and, consequently, the success of their careers. This in turn means that there are fewer black role models to attract young black students to the discipline. Some preliminary opportunities to unlock the increased transformation of the profession are identified...|$|R
