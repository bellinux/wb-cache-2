40|$|This paper {{discusses}} {{policy instruments}} for promoting the market penetration of {{clean coal technologies}} (CCTs) into China's electricity sector and the evaluation of corresponding effects. Based on the reality that coal will remain the predominant fuel to generate electricity and conventional pulverized coal boiler power plants have serious impacts on environment degradation, development of clean coal technologies could be one alternative to meet China's fast growing demand of electricity as well as protect the already fragile environment. A multi-period market equilibrium model is applied and an electricity model of China is established to forecast changes in the electricity system up to 2030 s. Three policy instruments: SO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>charge,</b> CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>charge</b> and implementing subsidies are considered in this research. The results show that all instruments cause a significant shift in China's electricity structure, promote CCTs' competitiveness and lead China to gain great benefit in both resource saving and environment improvement. Since resource security and environment degradation are becoming primary concerns in China, policies that could help to gain generations' market share of advanced coal-based technologies such as CCTs' is suitable for the current situation of China's electricity sector.

Therefore, we examine the effectiveness and impact of CO 2 emission charges using a spatial general equilibrium model of an urban economy, calibrated according to an average German city. Our analyses suggest that the imposition of a Pigouvian type CO 2 <b>emission</b> <b>charge</b> on urban passenger travel may be able to reduce emissions by about 1 %- 11 %, depending on the estimated social damage cost of carbon dioxide. Such a policy increases urban welfare mainly on account of a reduction of congestion costs. However, pricing congestion directly not only provides higher urban welfare but also higher emission reductions. Pricing congestion and CO 2 emissions simultaneously allows to achieve a wide range of emission reduction goals. If, however, the reduction goal is very ambitious the <b>emission</b> <b>charge</b> must be raised to higher levels. Then, distortions in the urban markets and in spatial travel decisions lower labor supply and thus urban production, income of city residents, federal tax revenue, income of landowners outside the city, all together implying losses in welfare.

40|$|We {{consider}} the environmental Leontief model, {{which is an}} input-output model augmented by pollution-generation and pollution-abatement sectors. Two formulations of this model, dating back to Leontief's work in 1970, {{can be found in}} the literature. One formulation treats an exogenously given vector of the tolerated level of pollutants (environmental standards) as a negative variable on the right-hand side of the model. The other formulation supposes that each industry eliminates a given proportion of the pollution that it creates, so that the proportions of gross pollutants which are subject to treatment by each sector enter as given parameters. Even in the case when the levels of production and abatement in the two different model formulations are equal, the solutions of the dual or price model are different for cases where some net pollution is left untreated. First, the analytical relationship between the two price models is established. Secondly, both models formulated in a linear programming framework are extended by imposing <b>emission</b> <b>charges</b> (effluent taxes) for untreated pollution. Finally, it will be shown how to estimate the level of <b>emission</b> <b>charges</b> for both model formulations such that they provide the same levels of production and abatement, as well as the same shadow prices.

30|$|The {{electron}} emission from the NCF cathode is suppressed by the volume charge, which is accumulated above the cathode surface. The volume charge manifests {{itself as a}} saturation-like dependence of the emitted charge on the laser pulse energy when the applied voltage is below 100  V. However if the applied voltage is above 100  V, the emitted charge is nearly linear function of the pulse energy. The dynamics of the {{electron emission}} under femtosecond excitation involves complicated charge redistribution. In particular, repulsion from the cloud of already emitted electrons results in the partial reabsorption of the emitted electrons by the NCF [12]. One can observe from Fig.  3 that by varying the applied voltage and the laser pulse energy one can control the emitted charge from 0.03 nC (it corresponds to the <b>emission</b> <b>charge</b> density of 0.24 nC/cm 2) up to 1.6 nC (13 nC/cm 2).|$|E

Using relatively crude estimates of the marginal costs, we compare the current pricing scheme with a marginal cost pricing scheme.

The empirical results indicate strongly and robustly that better environmental performance improves profitability by driving down costs more than it drives down revenues.

Drawing from both theoretical and empirical research, we explore a broad array of drivers behind corporate environmental strategies: internal characteristics, market pressures, government, and civil society. The empirical findings for developing economies suggest that ineffective regulatory agencies, limited law enforcement capacity, and underdeveloped green pressure groups provide weak incentives for environmental compliance, but foreign ownership and foreign customer pressure improve environmental management practices, and information disclosure schemes offer some promise for improved performance. The empirical findings for transition economies also suggest a positive role, albeit weaker, for foreign ownership and foreign customer pressure, but additionally reveal that government factors – greater enforcement, permit issuance, and higher <b>emission</b> <b>charge</b> rates – are more effective than in developing economies. ...|$|E

The results show that the average carbon emission reduction rates of four policies compared to the business-as-usual (BAU) scenario between 2015 and 2030 are 4. 00 % (Voluntary Agreement), 7. 25 % (Emission Trading System or ETS- 30, 000), 8. 33 % (Carbon Tax or CT- 37, 500), and 8. 48 % (<b>Emission</b> <b>Charge</b> System or EC- 30, 000).

Furthermore, the system responds resonantly to a narrow band of GHz-frequencies and the main resonance can be tuned by changing bias voltages. The effect of electromagnetic fields with frequencies in the resonance regime is also investigated, but, extraordinarily high field strengths are needed to affect the system.
