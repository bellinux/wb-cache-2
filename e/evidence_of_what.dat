5|$|Among the {{earliest}} evidence of chariot use are the burials of horse and chariot remains by the Andronovo (Sintashta-Petrovka) culture in modern Russia and Kazakhstan, dated to approximately 2000 BC. The oldest documentary <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was probably chariot warfare in the Ancient Near East is the Old Hittite Anitta text, of the 18th century BC, which mentioned 40 teams of horses at {{the siege of}} Salatiwara. The Hittites became well known throughout the ancient world for their prowess with the chariot. Widespread use of the chariot in warfare across most of Eurasia coincides approximately {{with the development of}} the composite bow, known from c.1600 BC. Further improvements in wheels and axles, as well as innovations in weaponry, soon resulted in chariots being driven in battle by Bronze Age societies from China to Egypt.|$|E
25|$|The {{first two}} National Monuments in the Department of Agriculture were Lassen Peak and Cinder Cone, created within Lassen Peak National Forest, California, on May 6, 1907, to {{preserve}} <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> {{was then the}} most recent volcanic activity in the United States south of Alaska. In 1916 these two monuments formed the nucleus for Lassen Volcanic National Park.|$|E

25|$|Another {{possible}} explanation concerns the metabolism of serotonin and dopamine. An imbalance in the neurotransmitter pathways of these chemicals {{could play a}} role. Viral infections have also been suggested as a possible cause. Evidence for their role includes lesions found in autopsies. CSF samples from KLS patients indicate that the condition has a different cause than influenza-associated encephalopathy. Triggers of KLS may also affect the blood-brain barrier, which could {{play a role in}} the condition. There is limited <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> role hypocretin may play, although it often influences hypersomnia.|$|E
25|$|In 1961, after Prausnitz's excavation, a large trench was {{cut into}} the tel by the {{national}} water company, Mekorot, so as to incorporate the local springs into the national water system. This inadvertently led {{to the start of}} exploration into the EB and MB archaeological remains at Kabri. The stratigraphy from the Mekorot trench was photographed and revealed the existence of the Bronze Age settlements. It also revealed the plaster floors – the first <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> would later be identified as the MB II palaces. The trench also cut into – and revealed the existence of – the MB II rampart.|$|E

60|$|These {{examples}} {{might be}} almost indefinitely multiplied, but surely they are sufficient {{to prove that}} the only safe and unquestionable testimony we can procure--positive evidence--fails to demonstrate any sort of progressive modification towards a less embryonic, or less generalised, type in a great many groups of animals of long-continued geological existence. In these groups there is abundant <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> variation--none <b>of</b> <b>what</b> is ordinarily understood as progression; and, if the known geological record is to be regarded as even any considerable fragment of the whole, it is inconceivable that any theory of a necessarily progressive development can stand, for the numerous orders and families cited afford no trace of such a process.|$|R
500|$|It {{has been}} speculated by Michael Wood and other historians that Ricberht may have been interred in the Sutton Hoo ship-burial near the Wuffingas centre of {{authority}} at Rendlesham, but most experts consider Rædwald {{to be a more}} likely candidate. Martin Carver has used the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he identifies as iconic pagan practices at Sutton Hoo to theorise that the ship burial represents one example of pagan defiance [...] "provoked by the perceived menace of a predatory Christian mission".|$|E

[...] Over a six-month period, Bell also compiled <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> he alleged was illegal surveillance of him by a government agency. In {{the days leading up to}} his arrest, he claimed that the agency had unlawfully installed a covert listening device in his home and a tracking device in his car, something the ATF admitted doing during the subsequent trial. The ATF stated that it had planted a covert GPS system in Bell's car and that it had tracked the movements of his Nissan Maxima in real time.|$|E
500|$|In late March, VIII Corps {{advanced}} eastward through Eisenach {{and then}} across the Fulda River. Here some of Middleton's infantrymen {{came across the}} concentration camp at Ohrdruf, discovering the sickening <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> had transpired there. Middleton called Patton to come take a look, and Patton was joined by Bradley and Eisenhower. [...] In his diary, Patton described the place as [...] "one of the most appalling sights that I have ever seen." [...] This was the first Nazi concentration camp to be discovered by the United States Army, and Eisenhower cabled Marshall to get a delegation from congress over to witness and communicate what took place there. Middleton later had officials from the town come in to witness {{what was going on}} in their midst. While every one of them denied knowing what was happening, the mayor and his wife both committed suicide that night.|$|E

50|$|The weak form {{alternatives}} to evidence-based anything include hearsay, opinion, rhetoric, discourse, advice (opinion), self deception, bias, belief, fallacy, or advocacy. The stronger forms include concerns about {{what counts as}} <b>evidence,</b> types <b>of</b> <b>evidence,</b> <b>what</b> evidence is available, sought or possible, who decides and pays for what evidence to be collected, and that evidence needs to be interpreted. Also there are the limitations to empiricism as well argued in the historical debate between empiricism and rationalism which is usually assumed to be resolved by Immanuel Kant by saying the two are inextricably interwoven. We reason what evidence is fair and what the <b>evidence</b> means (Critique <b>of</b> Practical Reason).|$|R
5000|$|It was Knutzen who {{introduced}} Kant {{to the scientific}} literature of the era and especially the works of Isaac Newton, who had such a powerful influence {{on the development of}} Kant’s own philosophy. Knutzen, however, did not consider Kant to be one of his best students, and favoured [...] (1722-1786) or Johann Friedrich Weitenkampf (1726-1758). Moreover, the name of Kant never appeared in the profuse correspondence between Knutzen and Leonhard Euler, which is <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> in <b>what</b> little esteem Knutzen held Kant.|$|R
500|$|Sir Francis Dashwood adopted some of {{the ideas}} of Rabelais and invoked the same rule in French, when he founded a group called the Monks of Medmenham (better known as the Hellfire Club).

[...] The group were known as the Franciscans, not after Saint Francis of Assisi, but after its founder, Francis Dashwood, 11th Baron le Despencer. John Wilkes, George Dodington and other politicians were members. [...] There is little direct <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> Dashwood's Hellfire Club practiced or believed. The one direct testimonial comes from John Wilkes, a member who never got into the chapter-room of the inner circle.

In addition to the jackalope, his examples include the sea serpent of Nantucket, which in 1937 led to [...] "stories of armadas hunting the monster, and footprint discoveries by local businessmen", accompanied by wide publicity. In similar fashion, Newport, Arkansas, publicized its White River Monster, and Algiers, Louisiana, claimed to be home to a flying Devil Man. Ware, Massachusetts, drew media attention to its local reputation for alligator sightings. Perry, New York, held Silver Lake Sea Serpent Festivals based on a local hoax. The Hodag Festival in Rhinelander, Wisconsin, celebrates [...] "discovery" [...] of a prehistoric creature in a nearby pit. Willow Creek, California, hosts an annual Bigfoot Festival.

500|$|Belt {{begins to}} act irrationally then collapses {{screaming}} as he hears {{mention of the}} ghostlike entity from the astronauts. Paramedics are called to attend to him, and find him cowering under his desk whimpering and begging for help. Before Belt is taken away, he tells the agents that the shuttle will not survive reentry due to sabotage by 'the face', which had lived inside his body and possessed him since his time in orbit. At his urging, they alert the shuttle to change its trajectory and are just able to land it successfully. In the hospital, Belt continues to wrestle with the presence, telling Mulder he wasn't responsible but also couldn't stop it, as [...] "it came to me, it lives in me". Eventually, in a last wrestle with the re-possessing entity, he shouts [...] "no more" [...] as he leaps from the window to his death - experiencing a lengthy flashback to his last space mission as he falls. Mulder theorizes that, while Belt was compelled to sabotage the launches by the entity possessing him, {{he was also the}} one who sent Generoo the <b>evidence</b> <b>of</b> <b>what</b> was taking place. He lauds Belt's final sacrifice, stating that in the end he gave his life for the mission, as befits a true astronaut.|$|E
