The snowflake schema is represented by centralized fact tables which are connected to multiple dimensions.. [...] "Snowflaking" [...] is a method of normalising the dimension tables in a star schema. When it is completely normalised along all the dimension tables, the resultant structure resembles a snowflake with the fact table in the middle. The principle behind snowflaking is normalisation of the dimension tables by removing low cardinality attributes and forming separate tables.|$|E

30|$|<b>Entity</b> <b>relationships.</b> For simplicity, {{we chose}} to work with single <b>entities</b> {{containing}} no <b>relationships.</b> There {{are a number of}} different ways relationships can be persisted in NoSQL databases: denormalizing to a single entity, storing them as separate entities, etc. This may have a drastic effect on the object-data mapper’s performance. A single <b>entity</b> containing no <b>relationships</b> allows us to monitor the overhead of each platform without unnecessary complexity. The performance overhead of an application that relies extensively on associations between entities may vary from the results obtained in our study.|$|R
40|$|Previous {{models for}} {{learning}} <b>entity</b> and <b>relationship</b> embeddings of knowledge graphs such as TransE, TransH, and TransR aim {{to explore new}} links based on learned representations. However, these models interpret relationships as simple translations on entity embeddings. In this paper, we try to learn more complex connections between <b>entities</b> and <b>relationships.</b> In particular, we use a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) to learn <b>entity</b> and <b>relationship</b> representations in knowledge graphs. In our model, we treat <b>entities</b> and <b>relationships</b> as one-dimensional numerical sequences with the same length. After that, we combine each triplet of head, relationship, and tail together as a matrix with height 3. CNN {{is applied to the}} triplets to get confidence scores. Positive and manually corrupted negative triplets are used to train the embeddings and the CNN model simultaneously. Experimental results on public benchmark datasets show that the proposed model outperforms state-of-the-art models on exploring unseen relationships, which proves that CNN is effective to learn complex interactive patterns between <b>entities</b> and <b>relationships...</b>|$|R

30|$|The second approach, {{which is}} also {{employed}} widely in several question generation systems, is template-based [4]. The template-based approach relies {{on the idea that}} a question template can capture a class of questions, which are context specific. For example, Chen and colleagues [4] developed the following templates: “What would happen if 〈X〉?” for conditional text, “When would 〈X〉?” and “what happens 〈temporal-expression〉?” for temporal context, and “Why 〈auxiliary-verb〉〈X〉?” for linguistic modality, where the place-holder 〈X〉 is mapped to semantic roles annotated by a semantic role labeler. These question templates can only be used for these specific <b>entity</b> <b>relationships.</b> For other kinds of <b>entity</b> <b>relationships,</b> new templates must be defined. Hence, the template-based question generation approach is mostly suitable for applications with a special purpose.|$|R

50|$|Chen's {{original}} {{paper is}} commonly {{cited as the}} definitive reference for <b>entity</b> <b>relationship</b> modeling though the concept of object relationship had been developed a year earlier by Schmid and Swenson {{as reported in the}} 1975 ACM SIGMOD Proceedings http://dl.acm.org/citation.cfm?id=500110. Chen is one of the pioneers of using the <b>entity</b> <b>relationship</b> concepts in software and information system modeling and design. Before Chen's paper, the basic <b>entity</b> <b>relationship</b> ideas were used mostly informally by practitioners. Chen first published an abstract and presented his ER model in the First Very Large Database Conference in September 1975, the same year of a paper with similar concepts written by A. P. G. Brown. Chen's main contributions are formalizing the concepts, developing a theory with a set of data definition and manipulation operations, and specifying the translation rules from the ER model to several major types of databases (including the Relational Database). He also popularized the model and introduced it to the academic literature.|$|E
