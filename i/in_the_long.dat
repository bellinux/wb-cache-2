He {{attempted}} a quad-triple, but {{stepped out of the}} quad and put his hand down, and followed it with a double. He placed fifth in the short program and earned himself his first new short program personal best in two years. <b>In</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> program, he completed a quadruple toe-loop as the first part of a quad-triple combination, but lost control of the landing, adding a three turn after it, and was unable to complete the following triple as intended. He performed a double loop instead of a planned triple loop and placed fifth once again <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> program, placing fifth over all.|$|E

5|$|His {{schedule}} in the Olympics was busy. Along with the decathlon and pentathlon, he competed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> jump and high jump. The first competition was the pentathlon. He won {{four of the}} five events and placed third in the javelin, an event he had not competed in before 1912. Although the pentathlon was primarily decided on place points, points were also earned for the marks achieved in the individual events. He won the gold medal. That same day, he qualified for the high jump final in which he placed fourth, and also took seventh place <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> jump. Even more remarkably, because someone had stolen his shoes just before he was due to compete, he found some discarded ones in a rubbish bin and won his medals wearing them.|$|E

5|$|A lack of {{knowledge}} about the capability of radar to create an effective centralized early warning system also contributed to the over-reliance on the self-defense capabilities of bombers. However Hansell also argued that ignorance of radar was fortuitous <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run.

5|$|A {{project group}} {{with members of}} the Norwegian Public Roads Administration and the National Rail Administration have {{proposed}} that instead of rebuilding the Ulriken Tunnel to double track, a new double-track light rail tunnel could be built from the city center to Arna.

Several politicians, including the majority in Hordaland County Council, have stated that <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>long</b> run they want the light rail line extended northwards to Knarvik and westwards to Straume and Kleppestø.|$|E

40|$|Abstract — In {{this paper}} we propose a novel twodimensional {{clocking}} and timing scheme for systems which permit a reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> line length <b>in</b> each clocking zone. The proposed clocking schemes utilize logic propagation techniques which have been developed for systolic arrays. Placement of QCA cells is modified to ensure correct signal generation and timing. <b>The</b> significant reduction <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>longest</b> line length permits a fast timing and efficient pipelining to occur, while guaranteeing kink-free behavior in switching...|$|R
