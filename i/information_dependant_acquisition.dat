40|$|Exosomes are nanovesicles {{that play}} {{important}} roles in intercellular communication as they carry information to target cells. Isolation of high purity exosomes will aid in studying the exosomal cargo and quantity {{as well as how}} cell-specific messages are carried. We describe a new method incorporating size exclusion chromatography (SEC) to enrich milk-derived exosomes from extracellular vesicles (EVs). This involved the initial isolation of EVs from bovine milk via milk processing and ultracentrifugation; followed by a new method to enrich exosomes using SEC. This method was compared to buoyant density gradient centrifugation, a widely used method of enrichment. Exosomes were characterised by particle concentration and size (nanoparticle tracking analysis, NTA), morphology (transmission electron microscopy, TEM), presence of exosomal markers (immunoblotting) and protein concentration (bicinchoninic acid assay, BCA). Proteomic profiles of exosomal fractions were analyzed by mass spectrometry using <b>Information</b> <b>Dependant</b> <b>Acquisition.</b> Milk exosomal fractions were shown to contain exosomal markers flotillin- 1 (FLOT- 1) and tumor susceptibility gene- 101 (TSG- 101). The new method produced a higher yield of exosomes compared to buoyant density gradient centrifugation. Pooled exosomal fractions exhibited intact morphology by TEM. The use of SEC confirmed the fractionation of exosomes based on size while minimizing the interference with proteins. Tetraspanins CD 9 and CD 81 were observed via mass spectrometry in exosomal fractions. This new and efficient method confirmed the signatures for exosomes derived from unpasteurized bovine milk. Purification of exosomes is a foundational technique in the study of biomarkers for pathological conditions and effective drug delivery systems...|$|E
40|$|Introduction: In {{the middle}} of the 90 's, the {{discovery}} of endogenous ligands for cannabinoid receptors opened a new era in this research field. Amides and esters of arachidonic acid have been identified as these endogenous ligands. Arachidonoylethanolamide (anandamide or AEA) and 2 -Arachidonoylglycerol (2 -AG) seem {{to be the most important}} of these lipid messengers. In addition, virodhamine (VA), noladin ether (2 -AGE), and N-arachidonoyl dopamine (NADA) have been shown to bind to CB receptors with varying affinities. During recent years, it has become more evident that the EC system is part of fundamental regulatory mechanisms in many physiological processes such as stress and anxiety responses, depression, anorexia and bulimia, schizophrenia disorders, neuroprotection, Parkinson disease, anti-proliferative effects on cancer cells, drug addiction, and atherosclerosis. Aims: This work presents the problematic of EC analysis and the input of <b>Information</b> <b>Dependant</b> <b>Acquisition</b> based on hybrid triple quadrupole linear ion trap (QqQLIT) system for the profiling of these lipid mediators. Methods: The method was developed on a LC Ultimate 3000 series (Dionex, Sunnyvale, CA, USA) coupled to a QTrap 4000 system (Applied biosystems, Concord, ON, Canada). The ECs were separated on an XTerra C 18 MS column (50 × 3. 0 mm i. d., 3. 5 μm) with a 5 min gradient elution. For confirmatory analysis, an information-dependant acquisition experiment was performed with selected reaction monitoring (SRM) as survey scan and enhanced produced ion (EPI) as dependant scan. Results: The assay was found to be linear in the concentration range of 0. 1 - 5 ng/mL for AEA, 0. 3 - 5 ng/mL for VA, 2 -AGE, and NADA and 1 - 20 ng/mL for 2 -AG using 0. 5 mL of plasma. Repeatability and intermediate precision were found less than 15 % over the tested concentration ranges. Under non-pathophysiological conditions, only AEA and 2 -AG were actually detected in plasma with concentration ranges going from 104 to 537 pg/mL and from 2160 to 3990 pg/mL respectively. We have particularly focused our scopes on the evaluation of EC level changes in biological matrices through drug addiction and atherosclerosis processes. We will present preliminary data obtained during pilot study after administration of cannabis on human patients. Conclusion: ECs have been shown to play a key role in regulation of many pathophysiological processes. Medical research in these different fields continues to growth in order to understand and to highlight the predominant role of EC in the CNS and peripheral tissues signalisation. The profiling of these lipids needs to develop rapid, highly sensitive and selective analytical methods...|$|E

40|$|The {{formation}} of conjugates between the electrophilic reactive metabolites {{of drugs and}} nucleophilic protein sites {{is known to be}} associated with toxicological risk. At present there is no low cost and high throughput means of reliably detecting the presence of drug-protein adducts in vitro or in vivo. The development of a reliable high throughput methodology would facilitate the study of underlying mechanisms of toxicity and prove useful in early screening of potential drug molecules. Assays using liver microsomes and trapping agents such as glutathione are used to produce and detect a wide range of drug reactive metabolites which are then characterised by mass spectrometry. The glutathione trapping is effective for metabolite identifications but, the modification of proteins by means of electrophilic attack on nucleophilic centres often occurs in an enzyme independent manner and is unlikely to be analogous to the glutathione model. In order to create a more suitable model system, three short polypeptides were designed and synthesised. These peptides were incubated with clozapine and human liver microsomes. The resulting metabolite-peptide conjugates were analysed by nanoLC-MS. Results indicated that a characteristic conjugate specific ion at 359. 1 Da could be detected for each of the peptides. This data was used to create a precursor ion scan specific for the presence of this characteristic ion. Protein separation techniques including SCX, Offgel IEF and 1 d-gel electrophoresis, in conjunction with LC-MS (with the precursor 359 scan), were applied to microsome prep samples in order to identify modified proteins. Using these approaches some 1700 protein identifications were made, more than 1000 of these were unique hits. The precursor ion scan was found to have poor selectivity identifying roughly 1 / 3 as many proteins as the <b>information</b> <b>dependant</b> <b>acquisition</b> approach. No drug-protein adducts were identified. Further to this a novel application of saturation DIGE was applied in order to enrich for the presence of protein adducts. The DiGE approach was used to identify some 15 proteins with apparent change in abundance (fluorescence intensity) between clozapine treated and untreated samples. Spots were excised from the 2 d gel digested and analysed by reversed phase liquid chromatography mass spectrometry. The IDA scans identified some 147 unique protein hits, the precursor ion scans identified 18. Again no drug-protein adducts were found. Biotinylated desmethyl clozapine was metabolised in the human liver microsome assay. Western blotting was carried out on a 2 d gel run from an assay sample. The Western membrane was probed using an HRP-Streptavidin probe. Imaging of the membrane revealed the presence of several biotin bearing proteins, many of which were not present in the negative control sample. A print out of the image was used as a map for the excision of modified proteins from a duplicate gel. Digestion and LCMS analysis of the samples revealed the presence of several proteins but no protein-adducts were found...|$|E

Information and communication technology (ICT) plays a significant role in this respect. As a networked tool, it enables efficient exchanges of video, audio and text data beyond geographical and time constraints. Since this data is exchanged over the worldwide web (www), it can be accessible by anyone in the world using the internet.

40|$|The {{growth in}} lipidomics {{research}} is uncovering {{a need for}} complete and comprehensive workflows for identifying and quantifying lipid species from biological extracts. In choosing analytical methods for lipidomics, different yet complementary mass spectrometry approaches can provide a more complete and comprehensive data set leading to a detailed characterization of lipid molecular species from complex extracts. A preliminary strategy carried out as global “shotgun” tandem mass spectrometry by direct infusion electrospray ionization or LC-MS/MS analysis, uses <b>information</b> <b>dependant</b> MS/MS scanning in both polarities for unbiased lipid profiling. The second approach involves multiple lipid-class-specific precursor ion and neutral loss scanning whose resulting spectra can be used directly to identify and characterize lipids and fatty acids in tissue-derived lipid extracts. The multiple precursor ion scanning (MPIS) methods have been published and recently reviewed by Ekroos et al, describing the advantages of targeted MPIS techniques for generating comprehensive lipid arrays from small sample volumes. Fully characterizing these lipid components by high quality MS/MS for fatty acid chain length and double bond positioning is a critical step for understanding their biological implications in cell signaling and lipid-initiated disease progression. Taking advantage of the speed, selectivity, and sensitivity of hybrid triple quadrupole technology, whole lipid extracts from rat brain tissue can be analyzed by direct nanoESI infusion for in depth glycerophospholipid profiling - achieving both qualitative and quantitative data (with the use of synthetic lipid internal standards) in very fast analysis times. Lipid species identification and quantitation is carried out using LipidView™ Software enabling post acquisition processing of precursor ion, neutral loss, MRM, and MS/MS data via lipid database searching and accurate peak integration.

This paper {{addresses}} {{the issue of}} representing time entities (i. e. instants and intervals) as Linked Data, and how to exploit topological temporal relationships {{in order to increase}} the connectivity degree within Linked Data sets. Describing and efficiently managing temporal information in knowledge management systems is important. <b>Information</b> is volatile, <b>dependant</b> on a number of contexts for its interpretation, among them “time”. Many data sets contain information that is valid only within a given time frame (e. g. roles fulfilled by different people at different times), whereas others describe temporal events. In this paper we present an approach to describe temporal entities as reusable URIs that can be adopted by data publishers as a temporal context for their information resources. The approach identifies a set of discrete temporal entities as relevant for a certain domain (e. g. financial years for the public sector) while a RESTful API is provided to users to dynamically create their own temporal entities. Once a dynamic temporal URI is resolved, information is provided to situate such URI in reference to the domain relevant entities. The URI resolution employs simple topological temporal reasoning in order to exploit the qualitative relationships between entities. We also provide a usage scenario of our approach based on a backlinking service and using Public Sector Information published in Linked Data format within the EnAKTing project...|$|R

Estimating echinoderm contribution to food webs and carbon cycling {{is important to}} our understanding of the functioning of the deep-sea environment and how this may alter in the future as climatic changes take place. Metabolic rate data from deep-sea echinoderm species are however scarce. To obtain such data from abyssal echinoderms a novel in situ respirometer system, the Benthic Incubation Chamber System (BICS), was deployed by ROV at depths ranging from 2200 to 3600 m. Oxygen consumption rates were obtained in situ from four species of abyssal echinoderm (Ophiuroidea and Holothuroidea). The design and operation of two versions of BICS are presented here, together with the in situ respirometry measurements. These results were then incorporated into a larger echinoderm metabolic rate data set, which incorporated the metabolic rates of 84 echinoderm species from all five classes (Asteroidea, Crinoidea, Echinoidea, Holothuroidea and Ophiuroidea). The allometric scaling relationships between metabolic rate and body mass derived in this study for each echinoderm class were found to vary. Analysis of the data set indicated no change in echinoderm metabolic rate with depth (by class or phylum).

The design of textual databases to act as archives or <b>information</b> repositories is <b>dependant</b> {{on a number of}} contributory factors which this paper aims to address.

The agencies involved include both human and non-human factors which interact forming a single network. The two main non-human factors are the information content, primarily text and images, and the software used in the construction. The methods used in designing and constructing the database will decide the number of human agencies involved, whether the different stages are undertaken by the same individual / group or whether each stage is the responsibility of a different agency. Design in this sense refers to both the aesthetic or visual representation of the user interface and the architecture of the database.

40|$|This thesis was {{submitted}} for {{the degree of}} Doctor of Philosophy and awarded by Brunel University. The analysis, parameterization and modeling of voice source estimates obtained via inverse filtering of recorded speech {{are some of the}} most challenging areas of speech processing owing to the fact humans produce a wide range of voice source realizations and that the voice source estimates commonly contain artifacts due to the non-linear time-varying source-filter coupling. Currently, the most widely adopted representation of voice source signal is Liljencrants-Fant's (LF) model which was developed in late 1985. Due to the overly simplistic interpretation of voice source dynamics, LF model can not represent the fine temporal structure of glottal flow derivative realizations nor can it carry the sufficient spectral richness to facilitate a truly natural sounding speech synthesis. In this thesis we have introduced Characteristic Glottal Pulse Waveform Parameterization and Modeling (CGPWPM) which constitutes an entirely novel framework for voice source analysis, parameterization and reconstruction. In comparative evaluation of CGPWPM and LF model we have demonstrated that the proposed method is able to preserve higher levels of speaker <b>dependant</b> <b>information</b> from the voice source estimates and realize a more natural sounding speech synthesis. In general, we have shown that CGPWPM-based speech synthesis rates highly on the scale of absolute perceptual acceptability and that speech signals are faithfully reconstructed on consistent basis, across speakers, gender. We have applied CGPWPM to voice quality profiling and text-independent voice quality conversion method. The proposed voice conversion method is able to achieve the desired perceptual effects and the modified speech remained as natural sounding and intelligible as natural speech. In this thesis, we have also developed an optimal wavelet thresholding strategy for voice source signals which is able to suppress aspiration noise and still retain both the slow and the rapid variations in the voice source estimate...|$|R

Trust deliberation is a soft security approach to the problem of mobile agent security whereby an agent is protected from the malicious behaviour of others within the system. Using a trust approach capitalises on observing malicious behaviour rather than preventing it. We adopt an architectural approach to trust such than we do not provide a model in itself, numerous mathematical models for the calculation of trust based on a history of observations already exist. Rather we look to provide the framework enabling such models to be utilised by mobile agents. As trust is subjective we envisage a system whereby individual agents will use different trust models or different weighting mechanisms. Three architectures are provided. Centralised whereby the platform itself provides all of the services needed by an agent to make observations and calculate trust. Decentralised in which each individual agent is responsible for making observations, communicating trust and the calculation of its own trust in others. A hybrid architecture such that trust mechanisms are provided by the platform and additionally are embedded within the agents themselves. As an optimisation of the architectures proposed in this thesis, we introduce the notion of trust communities. A community is used as a means to represent the trust <b>information</b> in categorisations <b>dependant</b> upon various properties. Optimisation occurs in two ways; firstly with subjective communities and secondly with system communities. A customised implementation framework of the architectures is introduced in the form of our TEMPLE (Trust Enabled Mobile-agent PLatform Environment) and stands as the underpinning of a case-study implementation in order to provide empirical evidence in the form of scenario test-bed data as to the effectiveness of each architecture. The case study chosen for use in a trust based system is that of a fish market' as given the number of interactions, entities, and migration of agents involved in the system thus, providing substantial output data based upon the trust decisions made by agents. Hence, a good indicator of the effectiveness of equipping agents with trust ability using our architectures...|$|R
40|$|Appendix {{end of the}} chapter. Signature {{recognition}} is an area which has been exposed to vast amount of research works, with diversity of directions. Signature recognition {{can be divided into}} two main areas depending on the data acquisition method: on-line and off-line signature recognition. From the subject of machine recognition of handwritten signature methods, the online recognition systems can acquire time <b>dependant</b> <b>information</b> like writing acceleration, pressure and pen moment in addition to the resulting signature. Therefore the online recognition systems give excellent recognition results. But, timely dependant local feature details are not available in the offline systems. Since offline signature recognition remains important in variety of applications. The machine recognition of the signature is a very special and difficult problem. The allied constraints arise due to the complexity of signature patterns, the wide variations in the patterns of a single person (i. e. inter personnel variations) and the forged signatures produced by the alleged forgers. The application areas for signature recognition include all the applications where handwritten signatures are already in use such as in the bank transactions, credit card operations or authentication of a document with important instructions or information. In this study, I proposed a method based on the fuzzy logic and genetic algorithm (GA) methodologies. It consists of two phases; the fuzzy inference system training using GA and the recognition. A sample of signatures is used to represent a particular person. The feature extraction process is followed by a selective preprocessing. The fuzzy inference system is followed by a feature extraction step. The projection profiles, contour profiles, geometric centre, actual dimensions, signature area, local features, and the baseline shift are considered as the feature set in the study. The input feature set is divided into five sections and separate five fuzzy subsystems were used to take the results. Those results are combined using a second stage fuzzy system. The fuzzy membership functions are optimized using the GA. A set of signatures consisting of genuine signatures, random forgeries, skilled forgeries of a particular signature and different signatures were used as the training set. Then, that particular optimized recognition system can be used to identify the particular signature identity. The recognition results authenticate that this is a reliable and accurate system for off-line recognition of handwritten signatures. V...|$|R
40|$|Methane-producing archaea, methanogens, in {{ruminant}} {{animals are}} {{a major source of}} anthropogenic methane. With a global warming potential 23 times greater than carbon dioxide, methane has been targeted for reduction under the Kyoto protocol. In New Zealand methane emissions from ruminant animals are major contributor to the national greenhouse gas inventory. For this reason agricultural industries are challenged with reducing methane emissions from ruminants. This investigation on methanogens in young dairy calves was carried out to obtain information on methanogen colonisation and establishment in the rumen because little is known about this process. In this study, methanogen colonisation occurred within two days after birth in four calves that were raised in the absence of cows. Anaerobic culture techniques were used to enumerate methanogens in gut samples and showed that methanogen numbers increased over time, but dropped below detection limits in two of four calves between six and 11 days after birth. Methanogens in these two calves then reappeared at day 13. By three weeks of age methanogen densities in all four calves were approximately 108 cells ml - 1. These densities are similar to those found by other workers for 3 -week old and mature ruminants. Colonies picked from anaerobic agar roll-tubes prepared from enumeration cultures yielded 31 methanogenic isolates and 28 isolates that utilised hydrogen but did not produce methane. Eleven of the 31 methanogenic isolates were selected for purification. Despite extensive efforts only four methanogens were able to be purified from the eleven isolates because of persistent non-methanogenic eubacteria also present in cultures. A phylogenetic analysis of 16 S rRNA gene sequences from purified and partially-purified methanogen isolates was carried out and dendograms constructed to identify methanogens. Some phenotypic characteristics of purified methanogens were determined. This revealed a number of methanogen species previously not found in the rumen. The results showed Methanofollis liminatans (three isolates), Methanoculleus palmolei (three isolates) or Methanosarcina barkeri (one isolate) were the predominant culturable methanogens colonising the rumen two days after birth. The three isolates identified as M. liminatans were only 96. 0 % identical at the 16 S rRNA gene level to the M. liminatans type strain, DSM 4140, and appear to be a new methanogen species. In gut samples collected 3 - 5 days after birth, Methanobacterium bryantii (three isolates) was found to be a predominant methanogen in some calves apparently replacing the first methanogens colonising the developing rumen. Twenty two days after birth Methanobrevibacter thaueri (one isolate) was identified as a predominant methanogen in one calf. These results are the first to suggest that there is a successional change in the methanogen populations as the rumen develops in young ruminants. Consideration of the colonising species showed that Mcl. palmolei were obtained from only two calves (calves 10 and 12) and that Mfl. liminatans-like isolates were obtained only from a different cohort of calves penned separately to calves 10 and 12. These methanogens, previously found only in terrestrial or aquatic environments, are probably the primary colonising methanogens because there were no mature ruminants to provide alternative inocula. It appears that the developing rumen of young calves provides a niche suitable for opportunistic hydrogenotrophic methanogens. A PCR investigation using targeted primers specific for seven groupings of methanogens was carried out on all rumen samples to obtain <b>information</b> not <b>dependant</b> on culturing. This analysis on DNA extracts showed methanogens belonging to the Methanobacteriales were present in almost every sample. Methanogens belonging to the Methanosarcinales and Methanomicrobiales were not detected in any sample. At the end of the trial (22 days), PCR analysis showed the presence of Methanobacterium spp. and Methanobrevibacter spp. in all four calves. Although there were some disagreements with results for isolates cultured, overall, PCR results confirmed the concept of successional changes in methanogen populations in pre-ruminant calves...|$|R
