A tunable X-band PIN diode switch, {{implemented}} in <b>evanescent</b> <b>mode</b> waveguide, is presented.

Accurate and time-effective modelling of filter and limiter {{states of the}} proposed switch is possible, using an <b>evanescent</b> <b>mode</b> PIN diode and mount model. The model is developed by optimizing an AWR Microwave Office model of a first order switch prototype with embedded PIN diode, to simultaneously fit filter and limiter measurements of four first order prototypes.

We propose novel experimental geometries that provide even more compelling evidence of evanescent waves. We investigate the shot noise generated by evanescent modes in graphene for several experimental setups. For two impurity-free graphene strips kept at the Dirac point by gate potentials, {{separated by a}} long highly doped region, {{we find that the}} Fano factor takes the universal value F= 1 / 4. For a large superlattice consisting of many strips gated to the Dirac point, interspersed among doped regions, we find F= 1 /(8 ln 2). These results differ from the value F= 1 / 3 predicted for a disordered metal, providing an unambiguous experimental signature of <b>evanescent</b> <b>mode</b> transport in graphene. For a graphene nano-ribbon transistor geometry, we explain that the experimentally observed anomalous voltage scale of the shot noise can arise from doping by the contacts to the electrical circuit.

40|$|Negative {{index of}} {{refraction}} has become an accepted part of transformation optics, which is encountered in transformations that change {{the orientation of the}} manifold. Based on this concept, various designs of perfect lenses have been proposed, which all rely on a folding of space or spacetime, where the maps from electromagnetic space to laboratory space are multi-valued. Recently, a new concept for perfect imaging has been proposed by Leonhardt and Philbin, which also uses multi-valued maps, but does neither include negative {{index of refraction}} nor an amplification of <b>evanescent</b> <b>modes.</b> In this context it was speculated that multi-valued maps should be seen as the basis of perfect imaging rather than amplification of <b>evanescent</b> <b>modes.</b> It might be useful to review the standard lens based on negative index of refraction from this point of view. In this paper we show that a negative index of refraction is not an inherent characteristic of transformation optics, but rather appears as a specific choice of a sign ambiguity. Furthermore, we point out that the transformation designed lens does not amplify <b>evanescent</b> <b>modes,</b> in contrast to the Pendry-Veselago lens.
