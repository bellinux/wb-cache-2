50|$|It {{is similar}} to the red-throated pipit Anthus cervinus, which is more heavily {{streaked}} and (in summer only) has an orange-red throat, and to the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> Anthus trivialis, which is slightly larger, less heavily streaked, and has stronger facial markings and a shorter hind claw. The song of the meadow pipit accelerates towards the end while that of the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> slows down.|$|R

50|$|The {{olive-backed pipit}} (Anthus hodgsoni) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird of the pipit (Anthus) genus, which breeds across South, north Central and East Asia, {{as well as in}} the northeast of European Russia. It is a long-distance migrant moving in winter to southern Asia and Indonesia. Sometimes it is also called Indian pipit or Hodgson's pipit, as well as <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> owing to its resemblance with the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit.</b> However, its back is more olive-toned and less streaked than that species, and its head pattern is different with a better-marked supercilium.|$|R
50|$|The Nilgiri pipit {{is closely}} related to the <b>tree</b> <b>pipits</b> and is a sister to the clade {{containing}} Anthus trivialis and Anthus hodgsoni from which it diverged in the Pliocene.|$|R
50|$|The hill is circled by swifts in the summer. Kestrel and buzzard may {{be spotted}} overhead. Breeding birds include skylark, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> and meadow pipit. The green {{woodpecker}} is {{attracted by the}} anthills.|$|R
40|$|Orientation cage {{experiments}} {{were performed on}} Capri in Italy, with a diurnal passerine migrant (<b>Tree</b> <b>Pipit</b> Anthus trivialis), and a nocturnal passerine migrant (Garden Warbler Sylvia borin), to study the use of magnetic compass information during autumn passage migration. The {{experiments were}} performed outdoors at sunset in: (1) the local geomagnetic field under natural clear skies, (2) a shifted magnetic field (mN - 90 [degree]) under clear skies, and (3) a shifted magnetic field (mN - 90 [degree]) under simulated overcast skies. Day migrating <b>Tree</b> <b>Pipits</b> showed a clear shift in orientation compared to controls (i. e. local geomagnetic field and clear sky conditions) corresponding roughly with the magnetic shift (mN - 90 [degree]) under clear as well as overcast skies, while the Garden Warbler migrating at night, {{did not respond to}} the same magnetic manipulations by shifting their preferred directions in the cages. The mean orientation of <b>Tree</b> <b>Pipits</b> did not differ from the sun's position during experiments, while it was clearly different in Garden Warblers. Species-specific orientation responses to experimental manipulations in caged compared to free-flying migrants is discussed...|$|R
50|$|Whitethroat, marsh tit, skylark, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> and {{grey wagtail}} {{are some of}} the birds {{recorded}} at the reserve. The great spotted woodpecker is also present. Over 70 different bird species are recorded for this site.|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Ancient wood-pastures {{are facing}} a major decline in several European countries. These {{habitats}} are of great importance for biodiversity because of their special, semi-natural character that increases landscape variability and connec-tivity. In this paper we examine the habitat preferences of the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> Anthus trivialis in an ancient oak wood-pasture, the Breite Natural Reserve, central Romania, {{with the aim of}} identifying the most significant habitat variables correlated with the presence of this species. In this way, we aim to highlight the need for conservation management of both the species and this particular habitat type, which are both declining across Europe. We found that the number of oaks with a diameter at breast height (d. b. h) > 1. 27 m (equating to a circumference of 4 m) was the only variable with significant positive effect on the presence of the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit.</b> Shrub cover had significant negative effect on presence. Tree canopy cover, the clumping tendency of trees and distance from forest had no effect on the presence of this species in the study area. Our results show that the habitat requirements for the maintenance of the <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> impose the same active management needs as those for the maintenance of the ancient wood-pasture character of the Breite Natural Reserve, namely the control against hornbeam invasion and ensured viability of new oak sapling generations.

50|$|Old Lodge Nature Reserve, {{managed by}} Sussex Wildlife Trust, offers open vistas of the forest's heathland. A well-marked nature trail leads round {{most of the}} hilly 76 hectare reserve, which {{contains}} acidic ponds and areas of pine woodland. The reserve is notable for dragonfly, nightjar, redstart, woodcock, <b>tree</b> <b>pipit,</b> stonechat and adder. It has been designated a Local Nature Reserve.|$|R
50|$|This {{habitat is}} home to badgers, foxes, voles, shrews and weasels, and {{pipistrelle}} and long-eared bats. Jays, green and great spotted woodpeckers are frequently seen, and rarer sightings include yellowhammers, chiffchaffs and <b>tree</b> <b>pipits.</b> Many butterflies, such as the comma and hedge brown thrive here. Also found are turtle doves, nightingales, grey and red-legged partridges, and barn and long-eared owls.|$|R
50|$|This {{is a small}} pipit, which resembles meadow pipit. It is an undistinguished-looking species, {{streaked}} brown {{above and}} with black markings on a white belly and buff breast below. It can be distinguished from the slightly smaller meadow pipit by its heavier bill and greater contrast between its buff breast and white belly. <b>Tree</b> <b>pipits</b> more readily perch in trees.|$|R
50|$|Dragonflies {{include the}} nationally rare white-faced darter Leucorrhinia dubia and the locally {{uncommon}} downy emerald Cordulia aenea and black darter Sympetrum danae. Abbotts Moss {{is one of}} only two sites in Cheshire where adders Vipera berus are found. Eurasian woodcock Scolopax rusticola breed, as do common redstart Phoenicurus phoenicurus and <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> Anthus trivialis. Over 150 species of spider have been recorded within the reserve.|$|R
5000|$|The site is in two {{separate}} areas. The Roman River, after which the site is named, runs along the southern boundary of both of them. There are areas of woodland, grassland, fen, scrub and heath. The woodland it mainly ancient, {{and there are more}} than a thousand species of moths and butterflies, and nearly seventy of breeding birds, including hawfinches, <b>tree</b> <b>pipits</b> and yellow wagtails.|$|R
5000|$|The <b>tree</b> <b>pipit</b> (Anthus trivialis) {{is a small}} {{passerine}} bird which breeds across most of Europe and temperate {{western and}} central Asia. It is a long-distance migrant moving in winter to Africa and southern Asia. The scientific name is from Latin. Anthus is the name for a small bird of grasslands, and the specific [...] trivialis means [...] "common", from trivium, [...] "public street".|$|R
