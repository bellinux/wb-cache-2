40|$|Abstract. Al/SiCp {{composite}} material is rapidly advanced {{due to its}} applications to weapon, military, aeronautics and astronautics. In some cases, fields of research are stagnating for its difficulty in material processing. In this study, we are particularly concerned about the cutting mechanism of Al/SiCp through modeling and simulations on wear rate of the tools. These simulations of tool wear rate and cutting mechanism of Al/SiCp are proved by cutting tests on Al/SiCp with nanocemented carbide tool WC- 7 Co and common cemented carbide tool YG 8. A detailed investigation suggests that the cutting instinct of Al/SiCp is of interrupted cutting process. And the <b>grain</b> <b>loss,</b> less tipping and blade fracture during tool wear results from high frequency intermittent shock by SiC grain. The wear behavior on the tool flank is mainly of <b>grain</b> <b>loss.</b> However, the wear behavior of the rake face is not only of <b>grain</b> <b>loss,</b> but also abrasive wear of WC grain by SiC grain.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to explore into the {{relationships}} between farmers' post-harvest grain management practices/capacities on the one hand, and liquidity constraints and impending risks on the other, in the context of achieving food security objective at household and national levels. The findings are primarily based on a household survey data from 300 randomly selected major food grain producing peasant households in three rural districts of Ethiopia. Results indicate that farmers perceived post-harvest <b>grain</b> <b>loss</b> as an imminent risk, and that instant sales of grains after harvest are triggered by temporary but immediate liquidity preferences to meet various obligations in the absence of or limited sources of cash other than crops sales, and by an impending risk of post-harvest <b>grain</b> <b>loss</b> and the limited capacity to prevent it. While specific considerations are essential, the general policy implication is that post-harvest grain management needs to be taken on board as a matter of strategic policy concern, not just from the perspective of reducing losses but also from the view point of considering it as a viable and dynamic economic activity in terms of generation of employment, value addition and income linkages. post-harvest, liquidity, risk, <b>grain</b> <b>loss,</b> grain sales, price fluctuations, Crop Production/Industries, Food Security and Poverty, Q 12, Q 13, Q 18,...|$|E
40|$|The {{knowledge}} and experience accumulated in over a decade of advisory work by the GTZ Post-Harvest Project has now been collected and summarized in a new handbook, Manual on the prevention of post-harvest <b>grain</b> <b>losses.</b> This has been written to provide practical instruction and assistance to storekeepers, plant protection technicians agricultural extension and quarantine staff and all those who are concerned with store e problems in their daily work. Particular {{attention has been paid}} to the storage of cereals and legumes. Throughout the book, simple, low-cost facilities and storage methods have been described, appropriate to the requirements of developing countries. In recent decades significant changes have taken place as a result of increased crop yields, the cultivation of new varieties that are often more susceptible to attack by storage pests than traditional ones, and the spread of new pests. These changes have diminished the effectiveness of established storage systems and there is now a need to adapt traditional practices and develop new alternatives. This handbook provides a practical link between old and new ideas. The effects on stored produce of different climatic conditions such as temperature and relative humidity, are explained. Farm and village level storage containers and buildings are described and illustrated as well as the construction of larger, centralized storage and stacking systems. There are details of the fungi and insects which damage stored crops, together with methods of control by insecticides, fumigation and integrated pest management techniques. Particular attention is given throughout to the safety measures which must be taken when using chemicals. The manual ends by addressing the problems of dealing with larger pests, such as rats.

40|$|The soybean is {{of great}} {{importance}} in the Brazilian agricultural scenario and both productivity and the areacultivated to each crop are increasing,demanding more speed and quality at harvest. However, losses arerecorded in the mechanical harvesting of soybeans, a fundamental stage in the production process of fieldcrops. Looking to quantify these losses {{was used in this}} study display a loss, and results were compared withthe losses collected manually. Data were collected at Fazenda São Luiz, in the city of Santa Juliana-MG, witha harvester dual-rotor axial, with a platform of 9. 14 m. We assessed 40 points in the day and night periods, andthe variables: water content of grains, travel speed, plant height, height of first pod, <b>grain</b> yield, <b>losses</b> due todisability at the time of cutting, trail system, cleaning system and total <b>grain</b> <b>losses</b> and losses in the separationof clean grain. The soybean harvest at night had higher levels of coincidence between the obtained sensorseparation and the losses measured in the field, while during the day there was a better match for the sensortrack. <b>Losses</b> of <b>grain</b> deficiency in cutting height contribute largely to the loss of soybeans at harvest duringthe day, reducing the correlation between the losses estimated in the field and the losses obtained from thesensors...|$|R
40|$|Early season maize is {{harvested}} {{with high}} moisture content {{that makes it}} impossible to store. The sale of early season maize in green form is uneconomical to the farmer. Experience had shown that farmers could hardly make the cost of production from their sales. Also, <b>grain</b> <b>losses</b> are high when maize is harvested green. To minimize <b>grain</b> <b>losses</b> and thereby increase value and the profit margin of the farmer, a grain dryer is necessary for wet grains. Therefore, this paper presents the design and development of a batch in-bin maize grain dryer. Some properties of maize such as moisture content and bulk density were determined to get information required for design of the dryer. The dimension of drying chamber, amount of moisture to be removed in a batch, quantity of air required to effect drying, volume of air required to effect drying, blower capacity, quantity of heat required to effect drying and actual heat used to effect drying were all designed for. A maize dryer was developed with a batch size of 100 kg of threshed wet maize. The dryer can be used in laboratory for experimental purpose {{as well as on the}} farm for commercial purposes. The dryer can be used to measure drying rates of maize at different initial moisture contents, drying air temperatures, drying air velocities and grain beds. The effects of different drying temperature, air velocity, loading and agitating speed on the quality of dried maize can be investigated with the dryer. </p...|$|R
