500|$|That afternoon, Cole {{attended}} the rally, wearing {{her dress and}} holding her sign. The Nixon train pulled in, and the police lowered the rope which kept the crowd clear of the tracks. In interviews, Cole related that as the crowd surged forward, she dropped her sign amidst the pushing and shoving. Cole stated, [...] "I wanted a sign to wave. <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> own placard and as the crowd moved forward as the train approached I saw this sign lying {{in the street and}} I just picked it up and held it high, hoping Mr. Nixon would see it." ...|$|E

2500|$|On August 9, 1995, at 4:23am, {{eight days}} after his 53rd birthday, Garcia {{was found dead in}} his room at the {{rehabilitation}} clinic. The cause of death was a heart attack. Garcia had long struggled with drug addiction, weight problems, sleep apnea, heavy smoking, and diabetes—all of which contributed to his physical decline. Lesh remarked that upon hearing of Garcia's death, [...] "I was struck numb; <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> oldest surviving friend, my brother." [...] Garcia's funeral was held on August 12, at St. Stephen's Episcopal Church in Belvedere. It was attended by his family, the remaining Grateful Dead members, and their friends, including former basketball player Bill Walton and musician Bob Dylan. Deborah Koons barred Garcia's former wives from the ceremony.|$|E

[...] "Thou hast {{suffered}} much woe {{because of}} the witchcraft of thine enemies. <b>I,</b> <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> mother, and thou, thou hast lost thy wives and children. Weep, my councillors, weep, because <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> mother, and Mopo, <b>my</b> servant, <b>has</b> <b>lost</b> his wives and children, by the witchcraft of our foes!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Have {{a little}} pity for me," [...] she said. [...] "I <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> father; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> mother; <b>I</b> <b>have</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> fortune--and now <b>I</b> am to lose Frank.

2500|$|... "I {{told you}} that <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> innocence and my blind faith in the eternity of love. And that's a pity—truly a pity, because I want to believe in it with my whole being. If I'm skeptical, it's not about now, but about the distant future. We are {{separated}} for too long at a {{time for us to}} be bound together forever. There's something hopeless and very sad about this feeling. You asked me about a child, and I said what I did because I'm not thinking that far ahead—because a child is the most wonderful creation and the final bond {{between a man and a}} woman (at least, that's how I see it, or let's say, that's how it should be and how I'd want it to be). And I'm not thinking that far ahead because I'm not convinced it's eternal. I only wish I could free myself of this doubt." ...|$|E
2500|$|During {{this time}} of her life she also was distant from her family, as she had married without their consent. According to Loveless, [...] "...I think my father thought <b>I</b> <b>had</b> <b>lost</b> <b>my</b> mind. This music is going to just ruin your life... it ruined your life... But it was a music that I learned from again... You wouldn't believe the people that would come to this club. They would get off from work, and they wouldn't go home. They'd come to this club and have a few beers, or ... dance.... I {{learned a lot about}} people and life in those places. I mean there was all walks of life... people who had hit the very bottom. And myself, there was times I felt myself {{becoming}} one of those people too. There was some hard times for us both, my ex-husband and I. And I think at the time, it caused us to be torn apart, and we lost respect for each other. And {{it got to the point}} that we didn't know each other..." [...] A low point of her life was in October 1979, when her father, whom she idolized, died near Louisville while Loveless was in North Carolina.|$|E
