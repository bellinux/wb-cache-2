This paper investigates the potential impact of audit opinion change on the timeliness of financial disclosures, with improvements in audit opinion considered to be “good news. ” We take both the direction and the magnitude of audit opinion change into consideration, with magnitude measuring how far the opinion is from an unqualified opinion (i. e., an unqualified opinion with explanatory paragraph is closer to an unqualified opinion than a qualified opinion is). We find that firms experiencing an improvement in their audit opinions disclose their financial results earlier, while those with audit opinion <b>deteriorations</b> <b>report</b> their financial results later, and that these effects were related to the magnitude of the opinion change. What 2 ̆ 7 s more, there is an asymmetric response to good audit opinion news vs. bad audit opinion news, with bad audit opinion news having a larger effect on earnings timeliness than the effect on earnings timeliness of good audit opinion news. Overall, our results support the “good news early, bad news late” notion. Finally, we also find that overall earnings timeliness has improved in China since the enactment of new reporting regulations in 2006...|$|R

40|$|Davidson et al {{reported}} an excellent study correlating a blunted nocturnal fall in BP with the subsequent decline in renal function. I would like {{to mention that the}} loss or reversal of the physiologic nocturnal fall in BP was demonstrated many years ago in chronic kidney disease, independently from external interfering factors. Patients with chronic nephropathies and patients with essential hypertension were matched by age, sex, and mean 24 -hour BP values. Ambulatory BP monitoring was performed in an open hospital ward for 48 hours at 15 -minute sampling intervals after standardization of diet, meal times, sleep times, and activity schedules. In essential hypertension, the nocturnal fall in BP was preserved as in normal conditions, whereas patients with renal impairment displayed blunted or reversed nocturnal BP and heart rate patterns. Hence, it appeared that casual measurements of BP confined to daytime may underestimate a hypertensive condition associated with chronic kidney disease. Increased sympathetic tone related to renal impairment was proposed {{to play a role in}} such a finding. Some years later, however, a polysomnographic study using continuous BP monitoring with a Finapres device (Finapres Medical Systems BV, Amsterdam, the Netherland) showed that nondipping status is also present in a minority (15 %) of essential hypertensive patients and is strictly associated with undiagnosed sleep-related breathing disorder characterized by apneic snoring. Furthermore, only continuous BP recording during the night allowed the proper identification of the nondipping condition, since a notable proportion of cases were miscategorized as nondipping by ambulatory BP monitoring. It appeared that polysomnography is necessary to differentiate sleep apnea from other possible underlying mechanisms. In view of the higher amount of target organ damage, which is to be expected in patients with nondipping status (including the renal function <b>deterioration</b> <b>reported</b> by Davidson et al), and the high prevalence of undiagnosed sleep-related breathing disorder in the adult population, the recommendation that one should incorporate an assessment of the subject’s sleep history into the routine diagnostic screening of any type of hypertension seems justified...|$|R

40|$|The {{overarching}} {{objective of}} this study is to examine the association between audit committee effectiveness and the level of earnings conservatism exhibited by Australian publicly listed firms. Studying the audit committee effectiveness/earnings conservatism linkage is both important and timely given the <b>deterioration</b> in <b>reported</b> earnings by firms. This study measures audit committee effectiveness based on four prime components underlying its effectiveness (i. e., independence; financial expertise; experience; and diligence) and earnings conservatism is measured following Basu (1997) and Ball and Shivakumar (2005). Using a sample of 494 firm-year observations for the period 2004 to 2008, overall results show that there is no significant association between audit committee effectiveness and earnings conservatism. Further analysis, however, indicates that firms with audit committees comprising financially qualified, experienced and more diligent members are associated with higher earnings conservatism levels.
