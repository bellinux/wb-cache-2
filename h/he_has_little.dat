5|$|To {{understand}} his character's world-view, McEwan {{spent time with}} a neurosurgeon. The novel explores one's engagement with the modern world {{and the meaning of}} existence in it. The main character, though outwardly successful, still struggles to understand meaning in his life, exploring personal satisfaction in the post-modern, developed world. Though intelligent and well read, Perowne feels <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> influence over political events.|$|E

25|$|Martin {{has often}} stated that, while he will allow {{some of his}} work to be optioned for film under the right circumstances, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> {{interest}} in movies and is not overly eager to see his work filmed. In 1999, his short story The Sixth Sentinel (filmed as The Dream Sentinel) comprised one segment of episode 209 of The Hunger, a short-lived horror anthology series on Showtime. Of all his books, only Lost Souls is currently under option, by producer Paul Natale.|$|E
25|$|The third book, which {{contains}} 290 verses, is by a much inferior hand. The writer calls himself Lygdamus {{and the love}} that he sings of Neaera. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> poetical power, and his style is meagre and jejune. He has a good many reminiscences and imitations of Tibullus, Propertius and Ovid (iii. 5, 15-20, and Ovid, Ars. am. ii. 669 seq.; Tr. iv. 10, 6: and Am. xi. 14, 23 seq.); {{and they are not}} always happy.

25|$|Allan Quatermain, an adventurer {{and white}} hunter based in Durban, {{in what is}} now South Africa, is {{approached}} by aristocrat Sir Henry Curtis and his friend Captain Good, seeking his help finding Sir Henry's brother, who was last seen travelling north into the unexplored interior on a quest for the fabled King Solomon's Mines. Quatermain has a mysterious map purporting to lead to the mines, but had never taken it seriously. However, he agrees to lead an expedition in return for a share of the treasure, or a stipend for his son if he is killed along the way. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> hope they will return alive, but reasons that he has already outlived most people in his profession, so dying in this manner at least ensures that his son will be provided for. They also take along a mysterious native, Umbopa, who seems more regal, handsome and well-spoken than most porters of his class, but who is very anxious to join the party.|$|E
25|$|Three months later, Tony {{returns to}} Miami. All of his assets have been frozen, and {{the districts of}} Miami he used to {{dominate}} have been divided among other drug cartels. His first act is to ask George Sheffield (James Woods) to become his lawyer again. Sheffield reluctantly agrees, but at higher wages than before. As Tony has no real power anymore, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> choice. He next travels to see his old friend and contact Felix (Carlos Ferro), who tells him Sosa is working with Gaspar Gomez (Cheech Marin) {{in an effort to}} take over all of Tony's old turf. He also warns Tony there are very few dealers who can be trusted anymore, as most report back to Sosa. Tony says he needs to make some small deals so he can make enough money to buy his mansion back from the Vice Squad, and begin to rebuild his empire. Felix advises him to speak to a bartender named Coco (Willa Holland). She puts him in touch with some dealers, as he slowly begins to re-establish his name, earning enough to re-purchase his mansion. He calls Felix, who tells him that he thinks Gaspar is smuggling cash. Tony steals one of Gaspar's trucks, carrying $50,000, and uses it to open a bank account. Reconnecting with his old banker, Jerry (Michael York), Montana uses the bank to launder his money as he sets out to reclaim control of Little Havana from the Diaz Brothers. As Tony's reputation increases, the brothers attempt to have him killed. He survives the assassination attempt, and one of the killers tells him the Diazes have murdered his mother. Killing them both in retaliation, he regains control of Little Havana.|$|E

500|$|Aware {{of his own}} sex appeal, Asher's {{confidence}} and dance ability mean <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> difficulty in attracting women. Thompson characterises him as having youthful fun, rather than being [...] "dirty". He feels he is easily intimidating, and intelligent enough to use his unpleasant façade to his advantage. This is demonstrated in the first episode, when he threatens Fatboy with a knife despite having no intention of using it.|$|E
500|$|According to the {{director}} of the video for [...] "Pork and Beans", the song is about [...] "the idea of being yourself, of being happy with who you are". In the album notes, Cuomo compares this to Timbaland's music, [...] "It actually sounds like a Timbaland kind of production; <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> baby crying type of sounds." [...] A reference is also made to Timbaland in the second verse with the line [...] "Timbaland knows the way to reach the top of the chart". The song similarly refers to items such as Rogaine and Oakley sunglasses.|$|E
500|$|After the 1966 election, Grimond {{confided to}} senior party {{officials}} {{that he wished}} soon to step down from the leadership. [...] Thorpe was now the senior Liberal MP after Grimond, and the party's highest-profile member, although Timothy Beaumont, chairman of the party's organising committee, noted in his diary: [...] "I am pretty certain that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> popularity within the Parliamentary Party". [...] When Grimond finally resigned, on 17 January 1967, an election to replace him was arranged to take place within 48 hours, leaving little time for manoeuvring. The 12 Liberal MPs formed the whole electorate; after the first ballot, Thorpe had secured six votes against three each for Eric Lubbock, the Orpington MP, and Emlyn Hooson who had succeeded to the Montgomeryshire seat. On 18 January Lubbock and Hooson withdrew their candidacies, and Thorpe was declared the winner.|$|E

500|$|In 2007, Bass {{stated that}} he had faith Timberlake would return after six months off to record another album with NSYNC, and that he felt betrayed by Timberlake's 2004 {{decision}} to pursue his solo career instead. Bass has also said that <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> hope for a reunion, since Timberlake has [...] "made {{it clear that he}} wouldn't be interested in discussing another album any time soon." [...] Despite these statements, Bass has denied that he harbors any ill feelings towards Timberlake, saying: [...] "At that time... it did feel like betrayal. I felt heartbroken. All these emotions went through me. Today, I’m really happy, and Justin and I are really great friends. I don’t hate him at all. And I understand what he was going through, and it was as hard for him as it was for any of us." ...|$|E
500|$|... is a Japanese adult visual novel {{developed}} by Key released on June 4, 1999 for Windows PCs. Key later released versions of Kanon without the erotic content, {{and the game}} was ported to the Dreamcast, PlayStation 2 and PlayStation Portable. The story follows the life of Yuichi Aizawa, {{a high school student}} who returns to a city he last visited seven years prior, and <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> recollection of the events from back then. He meets several girls and slowly regains his lost memories. The gameplay in Kanon follows a branching plot line which offers pre-determined scenarios with courses of interaction, and focuses on the appeal of the five female main characters by the player character. The game once ranked as the second best-selling PC game sold in Japan, and charted in the national top 50 several more times afterwards. Kanon has sold over 300,000 units across several platforms.|$|E
500|$|Santaolalla {{began work}} on The Last of Us early in its development. Druckmann did not give him {{specific}} directions but offered him the game's stories and themes. Santaolalla appreciated this freedom and felt it assisted his process. He {{felt the need to}} [...] "go into some more dark place, more textural and not necessarily melodic", when composing. The composer prefers to compose as he records, as <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> knowledge of reading and writing sheet music. To challenge himself, Santaolalla used a variety of unique instruments that were new to him, giving [...] "an element of danger and innocence". For some tracks, he used a detuned guitar, producing deep noise. To produce unique sounds, Santaolalla recorded in various rooms, including a bathroom and kitchen. The title track was composed on a variety of charango called a ronroco. The team wanted the game's AI to affect the music. They also tried to make the music evoke a reaction from the player, as their familiarization with the sounds would trigger a previous emotion that they felt. Music manager Jonathan Mayer felt that the game's action music was atypical for video game action music, stating that it is [...] "relatively low-key", and that taking it out of context changes the immediate reaction to it. The game's theme, [...] "The Last of Us", was the first piece of music that the team received, and they were very impressed. With the music, the team aimed to [...] "get emotion", as opposed to [...] "horror". Inspired by the sparing use of music in the film No Country for Old Men (2007), the team used music judiciously and tried to find other ways to [...] "make your palms sweaty". The orchestral portions of the score were recorded at Ocean Way Studios in Nashville by the Nashville Scoring Orchestra.|$|E

2500|$|During {{the course}} of the spin-off's run, {{especially}} in scenes at Frasier's apartment, Frasier and Martin regularly argue over the living arrangements and each other's personalities: Frasier is sophisticated, intellectual, and erudite, while Martin is a rugged man of simple tastes who speaks (according to Frasier) in words that no [...] "sophisticated, educated" [...] person could understand. While Frasier has many common interests with Niles and shares adventures (or misadventures) with him, <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> in common with his father, Martin.|$|E
2500|$|A {{similar case}} {{involved}} Clive Wearing, an accomplished musicologist who contracted a cold sore virus that attacked his brain, causing herpes simplex encephalitis. As a result, Wearing developed both anterograde and retrograde amnesia, so <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> {{memory of what}} happened before the virus struck him in 1985, and cannot learn new declarative knowledge after the virus struck him either. As a result of anterograde amnesia, Wearing repeatedly [...] "wakes up" [...] every day usually in 30-second intervals. [...] He {{has a history of}} repeatedly recording these moments of waking up in his journal (e.g., On Sept 2, 2013 I woke up, etc. etc.) and crossing out prior entries, as if the other moments of waking up were not real. [...] His episodic memory is nonfunctional (so he does not consciously recall having woken up 30 seconds prior). [...] Clive is often elated to see his wife, as if he has not seen her for a while. [...] Despite this, however, Wearing maintained his ability to play the piano and conduct choirs. This case is significant because it demonstrates declarative and procedural memory are separate. Therefore, despite anterograde amnesia preventing Wearing from learning new bits of information that can be explained in words (declarative memory), and also preventing him from storing new memories of events or episodes (also part of declarative memory), <b>he</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> trouble in retaining his musical abilities (procedural memory), though he has no conscious memory of having learned music.|$|E
2500|$|Alan Partridge (Steve Coogan) – sports correspondent. Partridge is an old-school lower-middle-class Conservative {{who will}} often say {{the worst thing}} at the worst {{possible}} time. <b>He</b> <b>has</b> <b>little</b> knowledge of the sports he is covering, and frequently makes critical errors on-air which reveal this. Partridge always ends his reports with the words [...] "I'm Alan Partridge, join me", then staring into the camera. Partridge shares an unusual relationship with Morris, who {{makes a point of}} making Partridge appear uncomfortable on-air: in one episode, his sports reports are interrupted three times by Morris; in another, Morris openly humiliates Partridge on-air; and in the final episode, Morris atypically compliments Partridge on his report, and {{goes so far as to}} kiss him on the mouth.|$|E
