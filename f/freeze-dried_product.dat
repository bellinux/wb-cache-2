40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to obtain a {{freeze-dried}} extract with an important antioxidant and antimicrobial effect from Rosmarinus officinalis. The extracts were obtained in a fluidized bed solid extractor and there has resulted that the optimal values of phenols, flavonoids and the highest reduction power were determined when using 70 % ethanol as solvent, the antioxidant activity ranging between 90 - 95 %. In case of the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product,</b> the maximum antioxidant activity was registered when using 0. 2 mg mL - 1 powder and the results were optimal as well in case of determining flavonoids, phenols and the reduction power. The antimicrobial effect of the extracts and of the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product</b> were quantified by using the Colony Quant software on the strains Escherichia coli CBAB 2, Bacillus cereus CMGB 215, Listeria innocua CMGB 218.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{research}} was to develop a stable bladder instillation of EO- 9 for the treatment of superficial bladder cancer. First, stability and dissolution studies were performed. Subsequently, the freeze-drying process was optimized by determination of the freeze-drying characteristics of the selected cosolvent/water system and differential scanning calorimetry analysis of the formulation solution. Furthermore, the influence of the freeze-drying process on crystallinity and morphology of the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product</b> was determined with x-ray diffraction analysis and scanning electron microscopy, respectively. Subsequently, a reconstitution solution was developed. This study revealed that tert-butyl alcohol (TBA) can be used to both dramatically improve the solubility and stability of EO- 9 and to shorten the freeze-drying cycle by increasing the sublimation rate. During freeze drying, 3 TBA crystals were found: TBA hydrate-ice crystals, crystals of TBA hydrate, and a third crystal, probably composed of TBA hydrate crystals containing ≈ 90 % to 95 % TBA. Furthermore, it was shown that crystallization of TBA hydrate was inhibited in the presence of both sodium bicarbonate (NaHCO 3) and mannitol. Addition of an annealing step resulted in a minor increase in the crystallinity of the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product</b> and formation of the δ-polymorph of mannitol. A stable bladder instillation was obtained after reconstitution of the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product</b> (containing 8 mg of EO- 9, 20 mg of NaHCO 3, and 50 mg of mannitol per vial) to 20 mL with a reconstitution solution composed of propylene glycol/water for injection (WfI) /NaHCO 3 /sodium edetate 60 %/ 40 %/ 2 %/ 0. 02 % vol/vol/wt/wt, followed by dilution with Wfl to a final volume of 40 mL...|$|E

40|$|A novel {{formulation}} for amphotericin B (AmB) delivery {{has been}} developed using micelle-forming 5 kDa monomethoxy-polyethylene glycol functionalized with cholanic acid (PEG(5 kDa) -cholane). This polymer was foundto increase 103 timesthe AmB solubilitywith a 12 : 1 AmB/PEG(5 kDa) -cholanemolarratio (2 : 1 w/w ratio). Dynamic light scattering and transmission electron microscopy analyses showed that PEG(5 kDa) -cholane associated with AmB to form 30 nm micelles. Isothermal titration calorimetry analyses performed at different pH showed that PEG(5 kDa) -cholane interacts with AmB according to multiple-site association profiles. Affinity constants and enthalpy and entropy changes were found to depend on pH, suggesting that the polymer interaction depends on the AmB ionization and aggregation. The <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product</b> could be promptly re-dispersed forming a colloidal dispersion with the biopharmaceutical features of the freshly prepared micelles, namely AmB solubility and micelle size. The dispersion was stable over one month incubation at room temperature.

40|$|Oyster {{production}} in Rhode Island accounts for over $ 2. 5 {{million in annual}} revenue, making it the top aquaculture product in the state. However, larval tank infections significantly constrain production and create substantial economic losses for commercial hatcheries. In most cases antibiotics {{may not be used}} to prevent or treat larval tank infections. A probiotic, or beneficial microbe which competes with pathogens, is a safer and “green” approach to preventing infections. Vibriosis, a common cause of oyster larval mortality, is the result of Vibrio species infections. Previous studies have shown that a native Rhode Island microbe, Bacillus pumilus RI 06 - 95, protects oyster larvae against infection by the pathogen Vibrio tubiashii RE 22. In this study, a freeze-dried formulation of this probiotic agent was evaluated for use in commercial hatchery tanks. Stability, dispersion and pilot-scale hatchery studies were performed to evaluate this product. A viability analysis of the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product</b> over time revealed that when stored at 4 ºC, the product will maintain viable probiotic cells at greater than the minimum effective concentration, 108 CFU/mL per single-use tube, for at least two months. The dispersion of this product in seawater was investigated using light microscopy, and qualitatively showed that the product readily and rapidly disperses within 30 seconds, without any shaking or added energy. A pilot-scale hatchery study revealed that the <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product</b> increased survival of three-day-old and eight-day-old larvae after challenged with Vibrio tubiashii RE 22 by 26 % (± 15 %) and 47 % (± 28 %) respectively, compared to larvae which received no probiotic treatment.

Blends of amylodextrin with diazepam or prednisolone were freeze-dried and kneaded at elevated temperatures, respectively. The products were analyzed by DSC, X-ray diffractometry, and FTIR spectroscopy. Complex formation with amylodextrin by freeze-drying was found not to occur for diazepam but for prednisolone at a molar ratio of 1 to 1. The <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product</b> of diazepam with amylodextrin proved to be a solid dispersion. Solid dispersions were formed by both wet (with ethanol) and dry kneading at elevated temperatures of low-melting drugs such as lidocain, diazepam, and methyl-PABA with amylodextrin.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} how the delivery rate of erodible sustained-release hydrophilic matrices intended for the delivery of poorly soluble drugs can be optimized through the incorporation of drug/cyclodextrin binary systems. Carvedilol (CAR), a sparingly water-soluble antihypertensive drug, was selected as a model for the study. As first, we attempted to improve CAR apparent solubility by association with hydroxypropyl-beta-cyclodextrin (HPbetaCD) and then incorporated CAR/HPbetaCD binary systems in sustained-release tablets made of poly(ethyleneoxide) (PEO). Solid CAR/HPbetaCD binary systems were prepared by physical mixing, kneading, co-melting and freeze-drying methods and characterized by DSC and X-ray powder diffractometry. The amount of CAR dissolved from all the HPbetaCD-containing systems was higher than pure CAR, the co-molten and <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>products</b> showing the best dissolution performance. The incorporation of the binary systems in PEO tablets resulted in a CAR release rate much higher than tablets containing only CAR. It was found that the time necessary to achieve complete release from the tablet was linearly related to the dissolution parameters of CAR/HPbetaCD powders. In the case of co-molten and <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>products,</b> all CAR content could be released in about 12 and 10 h, respectively.

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work was to study the stability of freeze-dried blackberry pulp. Firstly, both physical and chemical experiments were carried out on blackberry pulp prior to the freeze-drying process. Secondly, the freezing time for the blackberry pulp, three hours, was determined based on Plank’s method with an initial freezing temperature of - 2, 58 °C. Then, experiments with the frozen pulp were conducted in a freeze-drying equipment with three different temperature degrees: 105 °C, 110 °C and 120 °C, and a pressure factor of 1. 15 ± 0, 5 mmHg.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to develop a {{freeze-drying}} protocol facilitating successful processing of plant material containing the small surface antigen of hepatitis B virus (S-HBsAg) while preserving its VLP structure and immunogenicity. Freeze-drying of the antigen in lettuce leaf tissue, without any isolation or purification step, was investigated. Each process step was consecutively evaluated and the best parameters were applied. Several drying profiles and excipients were tested. The profile of 20 °C for 20 [*]h for primary and 22 °C for 2 [*]h for secondary drying as well as sucrose expressed efficient stabilisation of S-HBsAg during freeze-drying.

It was thus the goal of our study to assess an automated method to monitor reconstitution of a <b>freeze-dried</b> protein drug <b>product</b> in its primary packaging. A newly developed measuring device was used to measure impedance. This was achieved by detecting minor changes in impedance of the reconstitution medium, which occurred because of solid material dissolving during the dissolution process.

The endpoint of reconstitution was defined at an impedance change of less than 1 Ω for at least 7 s. Finally, we compared reconstitution times determined by the automated impedance method with results obtained by a visual method. In contrast to human operators, the new method delivered both accurate and precise results.

40|$|The {{pharmaceutical}} industry is at {{a turning point}} of its history, shifting from a mass production of patented drugs to a more competitive, innovative and highly regulated market. In fact, {{the last few years}} has seen the rapid emergence of the industry of off-patented drugs and the increase of the requirements of quality, safety and efficiency set by regulatory authorities. In addition, in the next years, the production of personalized, ‘on-demand', drugs will replace completely the old, batch, technologies with more flexible systems and continuous processes (Byrn et al. 2015). As the future of the {{pharmaceutical industry}} is continuous manufacturing, also freeze-drying of pharmaceuticals needs to be converted to continuous and integrated into the production chain. In this perspective, the design of freezing step plays a central role to reach the more stringent requirements of quality, homogeneity and standardization of <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>products</b> (Barresi et al. 2009; Pisano et al. 2016). Both trial-and-error and black box approaches, that are widely used to design freeze-drying cycles, become not sufficient anymore. A new mindset toward research and development is required to open and look inside the ‘black box', in order to design freezing protocols that produce dried products with the desired final attributes, to predict its variability within a production and the losses due to undesired off-target products. Of course, the product structure is a key factor in the production of stable and valuable dried products, because it affects the stability of APIs, determines the drying and desorption rate and, finally, the appearance of the product, the residual moisture and the rehydration time.

Sublimation tests were carried out using pure water and 8 combinations of chamber pressure (4 - 50 Pa) and shelf temperature (40 C and 0 C) in 2 freeze-dryers. Kv values were individually determined for 100 vials located in the center of the shelf. Vial bottom curvature depth and contact area between the vial and the shelf were carefully measured for 120 vials and these data were used to calculate Kv distribution due to variability in vial geometry. At low pressures commonly used for sensitive products (below 10 Pa), the vial-shelf contact area appeared crucial for explaining Kv heterogeneity and was found to generate, in our study, a product temperature distribution of approximately 2 C during sublimation. Our approach provides quantitative guidelines for defining vial geometry tolerance specifications and product temperature safety margins...|$|E

However, they suffer from the disadvantage of instability when stored as aqueous dispersions. Cryoprotection of the liposomal systems provides an effective approach to overcome poor stability whilst maintaining formulation characteristics, although, the formulation of a <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>product</b> requires the consideration of not only the selection of an appropriate cryoprotectant, but also needs careful consideration of the processing parameters including pre-freezing conditions, primary and secondary drying protocols along with optimisation of cryoprotectant concentration. This current work investigates the application of amino acids as potential cryoprotectants for the stabilisation of liposomes, and results indicate that amino acids show biphasic nature of stabilisation with 4 mol of cryoprotectant per mole of the lipid exhibiting optimum cryoprotection. The investigations of process parameters showed that the pre-freezing temperatures below the glass transition of the amino acids followed by drying for over 6 h resulted in stable formulations. Studies investigating the efficiency of drug retention showed that the cryoprotection offered by lysine {{was similar to that}} shown by trehalose, suggesting that amino acids act as effective stabilisers.

The results demonstrated that the morphology of <b>freeze-dried</b> <b>products</b> was different, {{depending on the type}} of internal phase; the nanoparticles prepared from chloroform-based nanoemulsions were completely dried and provided a fragile characteristic. The pectin nanoparticles also demonstrated good properties in terms of redispersibility, thermal properties, drug crystallinity and dissolution. The ITZ-loaded pectin nanoparticles showed high percentage of drug dissolved (about 60 – 80 % within 2 [*]h), and maintained their good dissolution properties even after 1 -year storage. The results suggested that freeze-dried pectin nanoparticles prepared from nanoemulsions could be used as an effective carrier for enhancement of ITZ dissolution...|$|R
