We carried out “blind testing” to test the efficacy (% tags found) and accuracy (distance between predicted and true tag location) of a portable antenna system (Texas Instruments) in winter conditions using 23 -mm PIT-tags. Up to 90 cm reading range was achieved and signals penetrated ice, rock, wood and water. In the “blind test” trials, {{a majority of the}} hidden tags (N = 12 – 30) were found indicating high tracking efficacy. PIT-tags that were oriented with their cylindrical axis parallel to the plane of the antenna coil <b>inductor</b> <b>loop</b> resulted in a bimodal detection field that had low detection range in the centre of the loop. The utilization of this bimodal detection field proved to be a very accurate method for identifying tag position (mean ± SE distance from predicted to true tag location 10. 9 ± 1. 4 cm) and thus well suited for microhabitat and activity studies in winter conditions. Aggregations of tags (multiple tags within 1 m 2) and obstacles for the antenna maneuvering (e. g., boulders, logjams) reduced the pinpointing accuracy (mean ± SE 13. 3 ± 1. 8 cm), but the reduction in accuracy was statistically non-significant between the single and aggregated tags...|$|E
40|$|Congestion is {{a problem}} that {{nowadays}} is facing people all over the world. It affects (in different degrees) developed countries as well as undeveloped. Congestion and queues on freeways cost money due to loss of time and therefore productivity. As a result it is considered important to assess it, {{in order to determine the}} severity of the problem faced. In the case of the Netherlands, a clear and accurate review of the causes of congestion and their contribution to vehicle loss hours is missing. For that reason, Rijkswaterstaat [RWS] proposes to investigate this topic. As a result, the main matter of this project is to differentiate diverse types of congestion. Hence the main research objective is to design a method to automatically identify the recurrent and (the most common) non-recurrent delays during single occurrences, on Dutch motorways. To achieve this objective the research question is posed: “Which part of single event delays on the Dutch motorways is caused by the following non-recurrent elements: roadworks, incidents, and adverse weather conditions?”. Besides that, the intention is to answer a set of subquestions and sub researching objectives, which are naturally related with the main research question. To accomplish these goals, it was necessary first to have a clear definition of congestion, which in this study was used travelling below a reference speed. It is also required to have a clear differentiation between recurrent and non-recurrent congestion. These are the elements that will be measured in this report. Reviewing the existing methodologies to assess different congestion, it was found that exist two main approaches to assess different congestion components: simulation-based and data driven. They both were examined in order to determine which would be the most suitable approach to be used in this study. Taking into account several factors, it was decided that the most promising approach is data driven, and thus it is the used in this report. During the checking process it was noticed some gaps in the existing methodologies to assess congestion, which are: explicit assessment of various causes of non-recurrent congestion, possibility to add in the model new causes of non-recurring congestion, different to those originally considered, lack of a structured methodology, and lack of considering network effects. Hence the new proposal fills all these gaps. Bearing in mind these facts and based on the existing methodologies, a new method was proposed to assess and to distinguish the different parts of the congestion: recurrent and non-recurrent, expressed in terms of delays. Given that the data collection process in the Netherlands uses <b>inductor</b> <b>loop</b> sensors spaced approximately 500 m, then the input data are speeds and flows measured by these sensors per motorway sections (space between these detectors) aggregated every 5 min. The remaining inputs are network configuration and databases containing time and locations of the mentioned nonrecurrent events. The outputs are the delays, classified in total, recurrent, non-recurrent with known and unknown (other) causes. The methodology was validated to show that its outcomes are realistic, and they are properly measuring the field conditions. The methodology was applied to a case study with real data. It was chosen a zone in the Randstad area including the A 4, A 13, A 20, and A 12 motorways in the Netherlands. The resulting delays data were analyzed and some conclusions were derived from the case study. It was found that in this area the A 13 and the A 20 present the higher congestion levels. It was also found that recurrent delays represent more than 50 % of the total delays and among the considered causes of non-recurrent congestion, incidents is the one that occur more often. In addition to the goal of measuring non-recurrent delays, it was also considered the existing policies and measures created in the Netherlands to handle them. It was found that they are the result of several years of investments and developments. Therefore, the existing policies and measures to tackle non-recurrent congestion (mainly Incidents Management IM and roadworks planning) have high quality. Nevertheless it is considered that it is required further integration of the above mentioned measures with ITS services, in terms of traffic management measures and an extensive use of the providing information services. The last is especially evident in handling adverse weather conditions, as one of the considered sources of non-recurrent congestion. It was found in the results of non-recurrent delays classified as ‘other causes’ are higher than expected. Part of it is originated in bottlenecks whose cause is not among the databases. Therefore it is considered that although the quality of the existing information is high, it is still necessary more information about different kinds of occurrences, different from those considered in this study. The case study results are promising, however the developed methodology requires more data (in more motorways and considering more time) in order to derive more generic conclusions.

The demonstrated versatile harmonic control approach composes of an inner <b>inductor</b> current <b>loop</b> and a simple voltage loop in the SRF. The inverter is regulated as a current source just by the inner <b>inductor</b> current <b>loop</b> in grid-tied operation and the voltage controller is automatically activated to regulate the load voltage upon the occurrence of islanding. An <b>inductor</b> current control <b>loop</b> is essential for obtaining high power quality in grid connection of inverters. It provides three-phase balanced current injection to the grid. Another advantage of using current control is that non linearities, such as inverter switching and external disturbances such as changes in the dc-link voltage Vdc and disturbance of the grid voltage Vg, are dealt within that loop. Thus, the control approach does not need a forced switching between two distinct sets of controllers. Moreover, the waveforms of the grid current in the grid-tied mode and the load voltage in the islanding mode are distorted due {{to the presence of}} non linear local loads with the conventional control strategies.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the design and practical implementation of a robust digital current controller for a threephase voltage source grid-connected interleaved inverter. Each phase consists of 6 half-bridge channels connected in parallel. Due to the current ripple cancellation of the interleaving topology, only small output filter capacitors are required which provide high impedance to grid voltage harmonics and hence better current quality compared to traditional 2 -level LCL topology. The current in each inductor is controlled via a single feedback loop. A feedforward loop of the grid voltage is incorporated to compensate for the grid disturbance. To control the high resonance frequency of the filter, high sampling and switching frequencies are required. Alternatively, resistors in series with the filter capacitors are used to provide damping. This method becomes practically possible due to the low magnitude of the current of the capacitors and consequently low power dissipation in the damping resistors. The paper also studies in detail the effects of computational time delay and grid impedance variation on system stability.

They are typically used on frequencies between 3 and 30 MHz.

The smaller of these loops show efficiencies well below that of the self resonant loops, but where space is at a premium, can provide effective communications. Loop antennas are relatively easy to build. A small transmitting loop antenna, also known as a magnetic loop,with a circumference 10% of a wavelength or less, will have a relatively constant current distribution along the conductor, and the main lobe will be in the plane of the loop.

Due to {{confidential}} information or other reasons {{only a part}} of the publication is presented in the repository. Wideband Class-B power amplifier is required in Modern communication systems. The bandwidth limitation of Class-B Power amplifier is generally caused by the narrow band 2 nd harmonic short. In this thesis the methods of 2 nd harmonic manipulation in Class-B power amplifier are discussed. In the beginning, the current and voltage waveforms at output of the amplifier are analyzed, and a series of load configurations which can give good performance in Class-B power amplifier is given. In single-ended topology the traditional 2 nd harmonic short networks are band limited and interaction between fundamental impedance and 2 nd harmonic impedance limited the performance of short networks. Introducing varactors into the short networks the bandwidth of amplifier is extended. Performance of commercial varactor is restricted by the breakdown voltage and package parasitic. A 32 % relative bandwidth Class-B power amplifier is realized with the 90 V break down voltage varactors from the Aeroflex central frequency of the amplifier is 1 GHz, the drain efficiency is above 65 % over the frequency band. In differential topology the fundamental signal and 2 nd harmonic are isolated, which provides convenience for wideband design. In practical design the bandwidth limitation is generally caused by the non-idea transformer in fundamental matching, compensation capacitors are required at primary of transformer. In low power condition, the 2 nd harmonic short bandwidth can be extended by using the coupling between primary <b>inductors.</b> Two <b>loops</b> structure is applied in this case. In high power design, the 2 nd harmonic is shorted though the large compensation capacitors. One loop structure is applied in this condition.

30|$|As manual traffic data {{collection}} is deemed infeasible as discussed above, {{the need for}} automated traffic {{data collection}} for roundabouts arises. Unlike relatively developed systems/tools for automated data collection for highways, those for automated traffic data collection for roundabouts are relatively scarce in the literature. The most relevant work to automated traffic data collection for roundabouts is those for signalized/un-signalized intersections [5, 6, 19, 20]. In [5, 6], wireless sensors were designed and used for detection of individual vehicle passing similar to how the <b>loop</b> <b>inductor</b> works for detection and counting of highway traffic. A sensor is typically placed close to the stopping line of each lane (but {{in the middle of}} the lane), and a vehicle was detected and recorded when it drove past it. When a vehicle makes a turn, ideally it is first detected by the sensor from the source lane and then by the sensor from the destination lane. In this way, vehicle turning volumes, which are a very desirable type of traffic data for intersections, can be automatically collected. However, the sensor approach has a fundamental algorithm limitation in that a cross-turning (for instance from North to East) may not be distinguished from a right turn (for instance from South to East), which results in inherent counting errors [19]. Besides, the sensor approach may collect only turning volumes, not other types of traffic data such as vehicle speed, waiting time and accepted/rejected gap sizes. If extending the sensor approach for intersections to roundabouts, the situation would be similar that only vehicle volume from entrances/exits may be collected. Therefore, the senor approach for intersections is not considered acceptable for traffic data collection of roundabouts.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the design, realization and characterization {{of an integrated}} Low Noise Amplifier (LNA) with a bandwidth from 0. 4 to 8 GHz. A very good noise figure is achieved in this frequency band. The design uses a source impedance of 150 ohm in the contrary to the standard of 50 ohm. The load impedance is 50 ohm. The use of a non- 50 input source impedance creates new possibilities {{for the design of}} the power and noise matching circuitry. A combination of a good power and noise match can be achieved for a very broad band, with a minimum of components. This concept requires a non-standard antenna (source) output impedance (150 ohm), which is for most antenna principles easier to realize then 50 ohm [1]. The LNA will be part of an active antenna phased array system, which should operate from 0. 2 to 2 GHz [2]. 2. Design structure Figure 1 gives the schematic of the two stage amplifier. The first stage uses source inductive feedback [3, 4], which moves the input impedance (S 11) of the FET closer to the optimum noise match condition. A minimum noise figure can then be achieved in combination with a good input return loss of the amplifier. Due to the selected input impedance of 150 ohm, a minimum of matching circuitry is required in the first stage. A small integrated inductor in series with the gate is sufficient. The integration of this inductor on the IC does not degrade the performance, which would be the case for a large inductor because of a relatively high series resistance of integrated inductors.

40|$|Strong {{demands for}} smaller, cheaper, and {{multifunction}} wireless systems have put very stringent requirements on passive devices, such as inductors and capacitors. This {{is especially true}} considering the size and weight of most radio frequency (RF) transceivers are mainly due to passives. RF micro-electro-mechanical-systems (MEMS) passives are addressing this issue by offering lower power consumption and losses, higher linearity and quality (Q) -factors, potential for integration and miniaturization, and batch fabrication. These advantages position RF MEMS passives as good candidates to replace conventional passives. Further, they also open an opportunity for using the passives as building blocks for lumped element-based RF circuits (e. g. Flters, couplers, etc.) which could replace the more-bulky distributed-element circuits.

This compatibility issue is crucial {{if they would be}} used to construct more complex RF circuits.

Further, test results reveal that high conductivity metals improve the Q-factors, and that low dielectric-constant substrates increase the SRFs.

This inconsistency was corrected in 1990 when, by international agreement, the constant [...] was assigned the value 483597.9 GHz/V and adopted by all standards laboratories. The assigned value is based on a weighted average of volt realization measurements made prior to 1990 at many national measurement institutions. The uncertainty in [...] is 0.4 ppm. Standards such as the Josephson volt that depend on fundamental constants rather than physical artifacts are known as intrinsic standards. Although the Josephson voltage standard (JVS) does not realize the SI definition of the volt, it provides a very stable reference voltage that can be reproduced anywhere without the need to transfer artifacts such as Weston cells. The accuracy of the Josephson voltage-frequency relation , and its independence from experimental conditions, such as bias current, temperature, and junction materials, have been subjected to many tests.
