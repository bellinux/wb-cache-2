5000|$|Chevrolet {{introduced}} a mechanical fuel injection option, made by General Motors' Rochester Products Division, for its 283 V8 engine in 1956 (1957 U.S. model year). This system directed the inducted engine air across a [...] "spoon shaped" [...] plunger that moved {{in proportion to}} the air volume. The plunger connected to the fuel metering system that mechanically dispensed fuel to the cylinders via distribution tubes. This system was not a [...] "pulse" [...] or intermittent injection, but rather a constant flow system, metering fuel to all cylinders simultaneously from a central [...] "spider" [...] of <b>injection</b> <b>lines.</b> The fuel meter adjusted the amount of flow according to engine speed and load, and included a fuel reservoir, which was similar to a carburetor's float chamber. With its own high-pressure fuel pump driven by a cable from the distributor to the fuel meter, the system supplied the necessary pressure for injection. This was a [...] "port" [...] injection where the injectors are located in the intake manifold, very near the intake valve.|$|E
50|$|In piston {{aircraft}} engines, continuous-flow {{fuel injection}} {{is the most}} common type. In contrast to automotive fuel injection systems, aircraft continuous flow fuel injection is all mechanical, requiring no electricity to operate. Two common types exist: the Bendix RSA system, and the TCM system. The Bendix system is a direct descendant of the pressure carburetor. However, instead of having a discharge valve in the barrel, it uses a flow divider mounted on top of the engine, which controls the discharge rate and evenly distributes the fuel to stainless steel <b>injection</b> <b>lines</b> to the intake ports of each cylinder. The TCM system is even more simple. It has no venturi, no pressure chambers, no diaphragms, and no discharge valve. The control unit is fed by a constant-pressure fuel pump. The control unit simply uses a butterfly valve for the air, which is linked by a mechanical linkage to a rotary valve for the fuel. Inside the control unit is another restriction, which controls the fuel mixture. The pressure drop across the restrictions in the control unit controls the amount of fuel flow, so that fuel flow is directly proportional to the pressure at the flow divider. In fact, most aircraft that use the TCM fuel injection system feature a fuel flow gauge that is actually a pressure gauge calibrated in gallons per hour or pounds per hour of fuel.|$|E

40|$|International audienceThe {{applicability}} of perforated panels {{placed in the}} <b>injection</b> <b>line</b> of a turbulent swirled burner is investigated as a passive control solution for combustion instabilities.

This paper focuses on the implementation of this technology in the <b>injection</b> <b>line</b> of a burner. The system is used to control the inlet acoustic reﬂection coefficient of the burner to stabilize the combustion.

Their behaviors nonetheless largely differ when facing large pressure ﬂuctuations levels (non linear regime) typical of those encountered during self-sustained combustion oscillations. Design criteria are given to control the reﬂection coefficient of perforated panels submitted to high pressure ﬂuctuations levels and damp thermo-acoustic oscillations.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 In {{the event}} of a small break loss of coolant {{accident}} (SBLOCA) in a nuclear reactor, cold fluid is injected through the reactor system high pressure injector to compensate for the coolant loss. When this flow rate is less than a critical value, however, the hot fluid in the cold leg penetrates into the vertical injection line in a process called buoyant backflow. Because the resulting penetrations induce thermal stresses in the pipe, the presence of backflow in the <b>injection</b> <b>lines</b> is potentially significant.

In addition, the experimental trends wi-re modeled theoretically. By matching the theoretical results to the experimental data, it was determined that backflow began below a critical Froude number of. 65 and increased in depth with the negative logarithm of the injection velocity. The agreement between theory and experiment was excellent. For a certain class of reactor systems, the full scale Froude numbers were then compared to the critical value obtained in the analysis. For the systems involved in this comparison, the full scale Froude numbers were shown to be less than. 65 for all practical flow rates.
