40|$|The <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> {{is a novel}} cold-roll forming <b>process</b> that {{involves}} <b>dimpling</b> of a rolled flat strip prior to the roll forming operation. This is a process undertaken to enhance the material properties and subsequent products’ structural performance while maintaining a minimum strip thickness.

In this paper, 3 D non-linear finite element analysis was employed to simulate the <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> and mechanical testing of the subsequent dimpled sheets, in which the dimple geometry and material properties data were directly transferred from the <b>dimpling</b> <b>process.</b> Physical measurements, tensile and bending tests on dimpled sheet steel were conducted to evaluate the simulation results. Simulation of the <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> identified the amount of non-uniform plastic strain introduced {{and the manner in which}} this was distributed through the sheet. The plastic strain resulted in strain hardening which could correlate to the increase in the strength of the dimpled steel when compared to plain steel originating from the same coil material. A parametric study revealed that the amount of plastic strain depends upon on the process parameters such as friction and overlapping gap between the two forming rolls. The results derived from simulations of the tensile and bending tests were in good agreement with the experimental ones. The validation indicates that the finite element analysis was able to successfully simulate the <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> and mechanical properties of the subsequent dimpled steel products...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The UltraSTEELTM process, {{developed}} by Hadley Industries Plc (Hadleys), {{is a novel}} surface <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> used on steel strip prior to cold roll forming. This <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> increases {{the strength of the}} final rolled products and enhances other product properties such as fire test performance and screw retention. Reported in this paper are the results of finite element analysis conducted to simulate the application of the spatially distributed dimple pattern to the metal sheet prior to the cold roll forming process. The model contains a representation of the two rotating rolls that plastically deform, imparting the spatially distributed dimple pattern on the sheet as it moves between them. The simulation results are compared with industrially processed UltraSTEELTM steel sheet. Consideration is given to the plastic region developed in the dimples and the effect of rolling action on the regions. The dimensional change of the metal sheet is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|The <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> {{is a novel}} cold-roll {{forming process}} that can enhance the steel {{material}} and structural performance by plastically deforming the material surface prior to the section forming operation [1]. Owing to the complex and interrelated nonlinear changes in contact, geometry and material properties {{that occur in the}} process and section forming, there have been no existing methods to simulate the <b>process</b> and resultant <b>dimpled</b> products and validate through physical measurements. This paper describes a numerical modelling approach and results into the mechanical properties and structural behaviour of cold-formed dimpled steel. A series of mechanical tests including tensile, plate bending and column compression tests on cold-formed plain and dimpled steel material were conducted for evaluation of numerical results. A finite element approach to practically simulate the <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> and experimental tests was presented. True stress–strain data obtained from tests were incorporated into nonlinear simulations of dimpled steel sheets and sections. The simulation of the <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> revealed that during the process, various levels of plastic strain are developed throughout the thickness of the steel sheet; this could correlate to the increase in the strength of the dimpled steel as observed in experimental tests and simulations. The simulation of the mechanical tests of dimpled specimens predicted similar results to the experiments, in terms of mechanical properties and structural behaviour. Since the finite element approach was able to successfully represent mechanical properties and structural behaviour of dimpled steel, it can be a powerful method in analysis and design of dimpled steel material and completed sections...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{presents}} compression {{tests of}} cold-formed plain and dimpled steel columns. A series of compression and tensile {{tests were conducted}} on plain and dimpled steel of different geometries. For each group of geometries the source of material for both the plain and dimpled steel columns was taken from a single coil. Within each group the sections were fabricated either by press-braking or cold-rolled forming. The buckling and ultimate strength of the columns was investigated. The change in strength of the dimpled columns resulting from the cold working associated with the <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> was also considered. This paper contains the results obtained when comparing the test strengths of short plain and dimpled steel columns using a compression test. In outlining the work the test setup and testing procedure will be described. Enhancements in buckling and ultimate strengths were observed in the dimpled steel columns-caused by the cold-work of the material during the <b>dimpling</b> <b>process.</b> The {{results showed that the}} buckling and ultimate strengths of dimpled steel columns were up to 33 % and 26 % greater than plain steel columns, respectively...|$|R
40|$|Dimpled steel {{products}} are produced from {{the combination of}} an innovative <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> and a traditional forming process such as cold-roll forming or press-braking. The wider use of cold-formed dimpled steel members has promoted considerable interest in the local instability and strength of these members. Of particular interest is their buckling behaviour and ultimate strength capacity in columns under compressive loading. However, the <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> produces cold-formed sections with a complex ‘dimpled’ surface topography and the ‘dimpled’ material is non-uniformly work hardened through the entire thickness. Owing to these complex issues, there are no existing analytical and design methods to calculate the buckling strength of dimpled products and validate against physical measurements. This paper presents {{the analysis of the}} compressive behaviour of cold-formed channel and lipped channel dimpled steel columns using Finite Element techniques. True stress–strain data obtained from physical tests were incorporated into nonlinear simulations of dimpled steel columns. It was found that the predicted buckling and ultimate loads correlated well with the experimental results. Based on the validated Finite Element results for different geometries, standard design formulae for determining buckling and ultimate loads of channel and lipped channel dimpled columns were developed. It is demonstrated that the Finite Element Analysis can therefore be used to analyse and design cold-formed dimpled steel columns...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this paper is}} to analyze the influence of specific laser system parameters on the microstructure of the ring formation process on the hard metal tools surface. The parameters analyzed were: working distance, incident beam power and tool surface treatment, flank and rake. The microstructures were analyzed with regard to its diameter and depth by an optical 3 -D surface metrology instrument. The analyses were made by comparing the rings process formation with the <b>dimples</b> <b>process</b> formation, a well-known process called ablation. The results show that the rings diameter is increased by increasing incident beam power or the distance of the laser beams focus for both surfaces. In addition, increasing the working distance decreases the rings depth for both surfaces...|$|R
40|$|Remote {{laser welding}} {{technology}} offers opportunities for high production throughput {{at a competitive}} cost. However, the remote laser welding process of zinc-coated sheet metal parts in lap joint configuration poses a challenge due {{to the difference between}} the melting temperature of the steel (∼ 1500 C) and the vaporizing temperature of the zinc (~ 907 C). In fact, the zinc layer at the faying surface is vaporized and the vapour might be trapped within the melting pool leading to weld defects. Various solutions have been proposed to overcome this problem over the years. Among them, laser dimpling has been adopted by manufacturers because of its flexibility and effectiveness along with its cost advantages. In essence, the dimple works as a spacer between the two sheets in lap joint and allows the zinc vapour escape during welding process, thereby preventing weld defects. However, {{there is a lack of}} comprehensive characterization of <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> for effective implementation in real manufacturing system taking into consideration inherent changes in variability of process parameters. This paper introduces a methodology to develop (i) surrogate model for <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> characterization considering multiple–inputs (i. e. key control characteristics) and multiple–outputs (i. e. key performance indicators) system by conducting physical experimentation and using multivariate adaptive regression splines; (ii) process capability space (Cp–Space) based on the developed surrogate model that allows the estimation of a desired process fallout rate in the case of violation of process requirements in the presence of stochastic variation; and, (iii) selection and optimization of the process parameters based on the process capability space. The proposed methodology provides a unique capability to: (i) simulate the effect of process variation as generated by manufacturing process; (ii) model quality requirements with multiple and coupled quality requirements; and (iii) optimize process parameters under competing quality requirements such as maximizing the dimple height while minimizing the dimple lower surface area...|$|R
30|$|A novel method, named “ball dimpling”, {{has been}} used to detect {{subsurface}} damage in machining of optical parts. The method was developed by the Optical Manufacturing Center of the University of Rochester [28, 29]. Similar to the traditional taper polishing method, the ball dimpling method polishes a sample part with a steel ball to make a dimple in order to expose the subsurface damage of the part. The depth of the dimple is large enough so as to cross the damage layer to the matrix. The depth of SSD is calculated by measuring the characteristic dimensions of the dimple. There are also some other forms of dimpling [30]. The ball dimpling method is simple in operation and low in cost. However, the scratches in a <b>dimpling</b> <b>process</b> may remain on the part surface, which can result in measurement errors. Additionally, the ball dimpling method is time consuming in SSD measurements for the parts made of hard materials due to a low dimpling efficiency [31].|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} tritium on the {{fracture}} toughness properties of Type 304 L and Type 21 - 6 - 9 stainless steel weldments were measured. Weldments were tritium-charged-and-aged and then tested {{in order to}} measure the effect of the increasing decay helium content on toughness. The results were compared to uncharged and hydrogen-charged samples. For unexposed weldments having 8 - 12 volume percent retained delta ferrite, fracture toughness was higher than base metal toughness. At higher levels of weld ferrite, the fracture toughness decreased to values below that of the base metal. Hydrogen-charged and tritium-charged weldments had lower toughness values than similarly charged base metals and toughness decreased further with increasing weld ferrite content. The effect of decay helium content was inconclusive because of tritium off-gassing losses during handling, storage and testing. Fracture modes were dominated by the <b>dimpled</b> rupture <b>process</b> in unexposed weldments. In hydrogen and tritium-exposed weldments, the fracture modes depended on the weld ferrite content. At high ferrite contents, hydrogen-induced transgranular fracture of the weld ferrite phase was observed...|$|R
40|$|Fractography and {{metallographic}} sectioning {{were used}} to investigate the influence of microstructure and strength on the fracture toughness (KIc) and fracture mechanism of an 18 Ni, 300 grade maraging steel. Increased yield strength from 1442 to 2070 MN/m squared through precipitation hardening results in a KIc loss from 143 to 55 MN/m superscript 3 / 2. Ti (C,N) Ti 2 S, and TiC inclusions in sizes from 1 to 8, 1 to 15, and 0. 1 to 2 microns respectively serve as sites for void nucleation and lead to fracture by the <b>dimpled</b> rupture <b>process</b> in all strength levels considered. TiC nucleated dimples occupy {{more than half the}} fracture in all conditions. Void nucleation rate and resultant number of dimples per unit area of fracture increase with increasing yield strength. Average dimple size decreases with increasing strength and/or overaging which follows from the decreasing amount of stable void growth measured by sectioning tensile specimens. Void growth is assisted by crack branching along a path of TiC inclusions. Coalescence occurs in the highest strength materials by a combination of TiC void nucleation and premature separation at strengthening precipitates...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of micro-dimples {{on the surface}} of workpieces has long been known to {{have a positive impact on}} the friction control and wear resistance at the sliding surfaces. Several manufacturing processes have been used to generate micro-dimples on the surfaces of parts subjected to mechanical contact. Among those methods, metal forming-based techniques have received little attention in the literature mainly due to the challenges present in formation of sub-millimetre <b>dimples</b> using these <b>processes.</b> In this study, a micro-dimple rolling apparatus was developed to rapidly generate dimples with square cross-sections and side dimensions of smaller than 200 μm. The dimples were formed {{on the surface of}} a low-carbon structural steel and the effect of generated texture on friction and wear was studied through pin-on-disc test. In comparison with untextured surfaces, the results proved that the dimples formed by the proposed system could effectively reduce the friction coefficient by up to 23 % and weight loss due to wear by up to 50 %...|$|R
40|$|The {{effects of}} tritium on the {{fracture}} toughness properties of Type 304 L stainless steel and its weldments were measured. Fracture toughness data {{are needed for}} assessing tritium reservoir structural integrity. This report provides data from J-Integral fracture toughness tests on unexposed and tritium-exposed weldments. The effect of tritium on weldment toughness has not been measured until now. The data include tests on tritium-exposed weldments after aging {{for up to three}} years to measure the effect of increasing decay helium concentration on toughness. The results indicate that Type 304 L stainless steel weldments have high fracture toughness and are resistant to tritium aging effects on toughness. For unexposed alloys, weldment fracture toughness was higher than base metal toughness. Tritium-exposed-and-aged base metals and weldments had lower toughness values than unexposed ones but still retained good toughness properties. In both base metals and weldments there was an initial reduction in fracture toughness after tritium exposure but little change in fracture toughness values with increasing helium content in the range tested. Fracture modes occurred by the <b>dimpled</b> rupture <b>process</b> in unexposed and tritium-exposed steels and welds. This corroborates further the resistance of Type 304 L steel to tritium embrittlement. This report fulfills the requirements for the FY 06 Level 3 milestone, TSR 15. 3 ''Issue summary report for tritium reservoir material aging studies'' for the Enhanced Surveillance Campaign (ESC).

40|$|The {{stability}} of shell structures {{has been an}} object of studies {{for more than a}} century. Thin walled cylindrical and conical structures are widely used in aerospace, offshore, marine, civil and other industries. The importance of taking into account geometric imperfections for cylindrical and conical thin-walled structures in buckling had been already recognized a long time ago. In spite of a multitude of publications on buckling of imperfect shells, such structures are still today generally designed at the preliminary design phase according to the NASA SP- 8007 [1] for cylinders and the NASA SP- 8019 [2] for truncated cones. Both guidelines date from 1960 ’s and they are based on a lower bound curve which does not consider important mechanical characteristics of laminated composite shells, such as the stacking sequence, thus producing configurations that are over-conservative or even non-conservative for some cases. Koiter in 1945 [3] was the first who theoretically demonstrated the already experimentally observed imperfection sensitivity that affects the buckling behavior of thin-walled structures. Nowadays, with the everyday increasing computational power, it becomes easier to consider imperfections in numerical simulations. However, in the early design stage the real geometric imperfection pattern of a new type of structure is not available. The Single Perturbation Load Approach (SPLA), a design method developed by Hühne [4], is a deterministic approach where a lateral load is applied prior to the axial compression (Figure 1), stimulating a single dimple. At this <b>dimple</b> the buckling <b>process</b> will start and a single buckle is produced, which will then propagate until the structure collapses. This paper presents investigations to develop an empirical formula for the design load for isotropic conical structures obtained by use of Single Perturbation Load Approach. The study is part of the running European Union (EU) project DESICOS (New Robust DESIgn Guideline for Imperfection Sensitive COmposite Launcher Structures, cf. [5]), which contributes to lighter and cheaper structures by a new design procedure for imperfection sensitive composite launcher structures, combining probabilistic and deterministic approaches...|$|R
