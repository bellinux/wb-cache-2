50|$|<b>Doripenem</b> is an ultra-broad-spectrum {{injectable}} antibiotic. It is a beta-lactam and {{belongs to}} the subgroup of carbapenems. It was launched by Shionogi Co. of Japan under the brand name Finibax in 2005 and is being marketed outside Japan by Johnson & Johnson. It is particularly active against Pseudomonas aeruginosa. The usual form is <b>doripenem</b> monohydrate.|$|E
50|$|In {{young and}} healthy adults, the {{elimination}} half-life of <b>doripenem</b> considering the average plasma terminal is normally around 1 hour.

50|$|The {{carbapenem}} ertapenem is one {{of several}} first-line agents recommended by the Infectious Disease Society of America for the empiric treatment of community-acquired intra-abdominal infections of mild-to-moderate severity.

50|$|Potential {{avenues for}} the {{development}} of resistance to <b>doripenem</b> are: altered PBPs (penicillin-binding protein), reduced activity in the permeability of the outer membrane especially when accepting foreign toxic substances within the cell, and deactivation of the drug by hydrolyzing enzymes from the carbapenem.Beta-lactamases (such as penicillinases) formed by gram-positive and gram-negative bacteria can stabilize <b>doripenem</b> to hydrolysis.

50|$|Ertapenem is a {{carbapenem}} antibiotic marketed by Merck as Invanz. It is structurally {{very similar}} to meropenem in that it possesses a 1-β-methyl group. Other members of the carbapenem group (imipenem, <b>doripenem,</b> and meropenem) are broadly active antibacterials that are used for infections caused by difficult to treat or multidrug-resistant bacteria (such as ESBL expressing Klebsiella pneumonia). They have very short serum half-lives and must be administered by intravenous infusion every 6 to 8 hours. Ertapenem differs from other carbapenems in having a somewhat less broad spectrum of activity (not against Pseudomonas aeruginosa), and in that its extended serum half-life allows it to be administered once every 24 hours.|$|E

An antimicrobial effective against Gram-negative enteric bacilli (i.e. aminoglycoside) or an anti-pseudomonal cephalosporin (i.e. cefepime [...] ) are generally added to metronidazole, and occasionally cefoxitin when treating intra-abdominal infections to provide coverage for these organisms.

It is {{an ideal}} antibiotic for treatment of serious nosocomial infections and severe sepsis for its exceptionally high efficiency and broad antibacterial spectrum of action. <b>Doripenem</b> is eliminated mainly by the kidneys. In cases of acute kidney injury, dosing of <b>doripenem</b> depends on creatinine clearance and requires adjustments. <b>Doripenem</b> is eliminated during hemodialysis because its molecular weight is 300 – 400 Da. The {{aim of this study}} was to establish the impact of continuous renal replacement therapy (CRRT) slow low-efficiency dialysis (SLED) on <b>doripenem</b> serum concentrations in a population of intensive-therapy patients with life-threatening infections and severe sepsis. Ten patients were enrolled in this observational study. Twelve blood samples were collected during the first administration of <b>doripenem</b> in a 1 -hour continuous infusion while CRRT SLED was provided. Fluid chromatography was used for measurement of the concentration of <b>doripenem</b> in serum. In all collected samples, concentration of <b>doripenem</b> was above the minimum inhibition concentration of this antibiotic. Based on these results, we can draw the conclusion that <b>doripenem</b> concentration is above the minimum inhibition ­concentration throughout all of CRRT.
