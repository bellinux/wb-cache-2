25|$|Of {{the nine}} 9F's {{to have survived}} into {{preservation}} {{two members of the}} class have run on the mainline in preservation, no 92203 Black Prince & 92220 Evening Star. Due to the engines <b>flangeless</b> centre driving wheels and the worry that the raised check rails on modern pointwork may cause a derailment the class alongside other 2-10-0 locomotives are presently banned from operating on the mainline including the Esk Valley Line from Battersby to Whitby which is used by the North Yorkshire Moors Railway on their Grosmont to Whitby trains alongside the regular passenger services on the route.|$|E
500|$|The MSC Railway's steam {{locomotives}} {{were designed}} to negotiate the tight-radius curves of the sidings and industrial tracks on which they ran. Originally only hence specifying 0-4-0 wheel arrangements, later 0-6-0 locomotives - purchased to cope with increasing traffic and loads - had <b>flangeless</b> centre axles, whilst the coupling rods had a hinged central section that permitted several inches of lateral play. A long term user of Hudswell Clarke, from their steam through to diesel locomotives, like many industrial railways later motive power was often provided by the purchase of refurbished former [...] "big-four" [...] operated types, with the advantage that crew were hence readily available to operate these types. Post-WWII purchases included several war surplus Hunslet 'Austerity' 0-6-0 saddle tanks; the last steam locomotive types purchased for the MSC Railway. A fleet of diesel locomotives was purchased between 1959 and 1966, including 18 0-4-0 diesels from the Rolls-Royce-owned Sentinel Waggon Works from 1964-66. These enabled the MSC Railways to complete its conversion from steam on 6 July 1966, {{more than three years}} before British Railways.|$|E
2500|$|These {{primitive}} rails were superseded in 1793 {{when the}} then {{superintendent of the}} Cromford Canal, Benjamin Outram, constructed a tramway with 'L'-shaped flanged cast-iron plate rails from the quarry at Crich: {{it was a little}} over a mile in length descending some [...] and had a gauge of [...] Wagons fitted with simple <b>flangeless</b> wheels were kept on the track by vertical ledges, or plates. Cast-iron rails were a significant improvement over wooden rails as they could support a greater weight and the friction between wheel and rail was lower, allowing longer trains to be moved by horses.|$|E
50|$|The tramway also {{introduced}} {{a system to}} allow road-worthy <b>flangeless</b> wheeled wagons on the line, first proposed by Alfred Holt, engineer, and brought into practice by Henry Barcroft of the Bessbrook spinning Co.; the system used a section set of rails, outside the main and slightly lower (7/8 inch), on which the <b>flangeless</b> wheels ran, using the inner main rails as guides.|$|E

5000|$|The Australian Standard Garratt had <b>flangeless</b> leading {{driving wheels}} which tended to cause {{derailments}} on sharp curves.|$|E
50|$|B16.34- Valves-Flanges, Threaded and Welding End. This Standard {{applies to}} new construction. It covers pressure-temperature ratings, dimensions, tolerances, materials, {{nondestructive}} examination requirements, testing, and marking for cast, forged, and fabricated flanged, threaded, and welding end and wafer or <b>flangeless</b> valves of steel, nickel-base alloys, and other alloys shown in Table 1. Wafer or <b>flangeless</b> valves, bolted or through-bolt types that are installed between flanges or against a flange {{are treated as}} flanged-end valves. Alternative rules for NPS 2½ and smaller valves are given in Mandatory Appendix V.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were delivered}} with Type XE1 tenders. Their intermediate and driving coupled wheels were <b>flangeless</b> {{to allow them}} to cope with tight curves, such as in turnouts.|$|E
5000|$|Birkby’s Brickworks, small steel wagon with 4 <b>flangeless</b> {{wheels and}} forked bracket to accept haulage chain. It ran on an 18in gauge plateway made up from lengths of steel angle. Donated 1983.|$|E
50|$|On {{small scale}} models the {{trailing}} wheels of Cartazzi-axled locomotives are often <b>flangeless</b> to allow negotiation of tighter, non-prototypical curves, or the Cartazzi axle {{has been replaced}} with a pony truck for the same reason.|$|E
50|$|The {{first was}} {{delivered}} in May 1896 by Beyer, Peacock and Company with further orders {{over the next}} 20 years seeing the class number 280. Their second and third coupled wheel tyres were <b>flangeless</b> to reduce curve friction.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotive}} had Walschaerts {{valve gear}} and was superheated. Its cast steel frame {{was a single}} casting with separately attached cylinders. As built, the third coupled axle had <b>flangeless</b> wheels to negotiate the tight curves found in docks.|$|E
50|$|During 1937, the Class 16C engines were {{fitted with}} Stone-Deuta speed indicators. As built, the second coupled axle had <b>flangeless</b> wheels, {{but these were}} later retyred with flanges to obtain better {{distribution}} of tyre flange wear and improved running.|$|E
50|$|A {{powerful}} {{steam locomotive}} is problematic {{on a track}} gauge of only 2 ft with a tight minimum radius of about 150 ft which, in practice, restricts powerful rigid-frame locomotives to four-coupled wheels, often {{with at least one}} <b>flangeless</b> coupled wheelset.|$|E
50|$|Beecher was a {{prolific}} inventor. His inventions include {{a type of}} monorail, a portable telephone purposed for the army, and a <b>flangeless</b> system for railways. He was, however, {{best known for his}} roller coaster design—particularly his innovations in looping roller coasters.|$|E
50|$|The {{distinctive}} designs by James Pearson, {{the railway}} company's engineer, featured single large <b>flangeless</b> driving wheels and two supporting bogies. The water was carried in both well and back tanks, leaving the boilers exposed {{in the same}} way as tender locomotives.|$|E
50|$|This {{system was}} not {{suitable}} for steam locomotives so Arnoux invented a separate system for them. The locomotives had a 2-4-2 wheel arrangement and the driving wheels were <b>flangeless.</b> The carrying wheels were arranged to pivot and were controlled by near-horizontal guide wheels.|$|E
50|$|The main {{shortcoming}} of the Reid Tenwheeler was {{a tendency}} to derail while reversing, particularly over points, since the trailing drivers were <b>flangeless.</b> On the NGR, this was overcome by increasing the tyre width of these wheels from 6 in to 7 in.|$|E
50|$|In 1908, Hughes {{produced}} a locomotive {{of this type}} for the Lancashire and Yorkshire. These tank engines {{were based on the}} previous Aspinall Class 30 0-8-0 tender engines, although their similarities have often been over-emphasised. Their coupled wheelbase was extended by two feet to 24 ft, requiring the two centre drivers to be <b>flangeless,</b> with widened tyre treads, to allow them to negotiate a tight radius curve within a marshalling yard. This was more successful than similar <b>flangeless</b> drivers had been with Hoy's Class 26 2-6-2Ts, where they had shown a tendency for the centre drivers to drop between the rails if track in a siding wasn't maintained as well as main-line track. The two inside cylinders were 21+1/2 x 26 in and were the largest in size of any non-compound engine in the country.|$|E
5000|$|The wooden flat-topped waggons had iron <b>flangeless</b> {{wheels and}} ran in trains of usually twelve waggons drawn by around 18 horses in single file, in {{front for the}} upward journey and at the rear for the downward. An old sailor called Thomas Taverner wrote a poem which gives us this information: ...|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} were of {{a standard}} type which was being used on the narrow gauge railroads of Maine in the United States of America. They had bar frames and used Stephenson valve gear. The drivers, the middle wheelset of the coupled wheels, were <b>flangeless</b> to enable the engine to negotiate sharp curves.|$|E
50|$|To {{be able to}} {{negotiate}} sharp curves, both the first and fifth pairs of coupled wheels of the Reid Tenwheeler locomotive were <b>flangeless.</b> The locomotive used saturated steam and was equipped with Allan straight link valve gear. The trailing Bissel truck was of the Cartazzi type, which allowed the axle some lateral movement.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were built}} with plate frames, Walschaerts valve gear, superheaters and Belpaire fireboxes. It {{was designed to}} have as short a fixed wheelbase as possible and the close spacing of the coupled wheels necessitated specially designed brake hangers outside the wheels. As built, the leading coupled axle had <b>flangeless</b> wheels, but it was subsequently retyred with flanges.|$|E
50|$|Jaszczak phantoms {{consist of}} a main {{cylinder}} or tank made of acrylic plastic with several inserts. The circular phantom comes in two varieties: flanged and <b>flangeless.</b> The latter is recommended by the American College of Radiology for accreditation of nuclear medicine departments. All Jaszczak phantoms have six solid spheres and six sets of 'cold' rods. In flanged models, the sizes of the spheres vary. The number of rods in each set depends {{on the size of}} the rod in that set as different models of the phantom have rods of different sizes. In <b>flangeless</b> models, the diameters of the spheres are 9.5, 12.7, 15.9, 19.1, 25.4 and 31.8 mm, while the rod diameters are 4.8, 6.4, 7.9, 9.5, 11.1 and 12.7 mm. Both solid spheres and rod inserts mimic cold lesions in a hot background. Spheres are used to measure the image contrast while the rods are used to investigate the image resolution in SPECT systems.|$|E
50|$|It {{opened in}} 1812, {{and was the}} first railway in Scotland to obtain an authorising Act of Parliament; it was also the first railway in Scotland to use a steam locomotive; the first to carry passengers; and the River Irvine bridge, Laigh Milton Viaduct, is the {{earliest}} railway viaduct in Scotland. It was a plateway, using L-shaped iron plates as rails, to carry wagons with <b>flangeless</b> wheels.|$|E
5000|$|Ten {{more were}} {{delivered}} by NBL in 1915, numbered {{in the range}} from 1789 to 1798. While the first two batches were delivered with all coupled wheels flanged, beginning with this third batch the leading coupled wheels were <b>flangeless</b> to cope with the sharp curves on the Hex River Pass. These and subsequent locomotives had rear end running boards which continued straight through underneath their cabs.|$|E
50|$|The main {{shortcoming}} of the Reid Tenwheeler was {{a tendency}} to derail while reversing, particularly over points, since the trailing coupled wheels were <b>flangeless</b> and tended to drop off the rails in the 1 in 7 turnouts which were in use at the time. This was overcome by increasing the tyre width from 6 in to 7 in, after which the locomotives proved successful in service.|$|E
50|$|Like their Type B 4-6-0 sister engines, the {{locomotives}} had bar frames. The drivers, {{the middle}} wheelset of the coupled wheels, were <b>flangeless</b> {{to enable the}} engine to negotiate sharp curves. The coupled wheels were not spaced equidistant from each other, with 39 in between the wheel centres of the leading wheelset and the drivers and 36 in between the wheel centres of the drivers and the trailing wheelset.|$|E
50|$|The {{first eight}} known 4-2-4 {{locomotives}} entered {{service on the}} broad gauge Bristol and Exeter Railway in 1853 and 1854, numbered {{in the range from}} 39 to 46. They had 9 ft diameter <b>flangeless</b> driving wheels, supported by leading and trailing two-axle bogies. The water was carried in both well- and back-tanks. Two more engines were built in 1859 and 1862, but with much smaller 7 ft diameter driving wheels.|$|E
50|$|The {{reduction}} in axle load was to suit {{some of the}} lighter branch lines and, {{as part of the}} weight reduction, the Class 19A was delivered with a new smaller Type MP tender with a fuel capacity of 9 lt 4 lcwt t, a water capacity of 4250 imp gal and a maximum axle load of 12 lt 17 lcwt 2 qtr kg. The leading coupled wheels had <b>flangeless</b> tyres, but these were later flanged.|$|E
50|$|The {{locomotives}} {{were set}} up to run cab (or bunker) first, effectively as a 4-4-0 (or 6-4-0). The 4-4-0 wheel arrangement, with its three-point suspension, was noted for its good tracking ability, while the <b>flangeless</b> middle wheels allowed the locomotive to round tight curves. Placing the fuel and water over the truck rather than the driving wheels meant the locos had a constant adhesive weight, something other forms of tank locomotive did not.|$|E
50|$|This weapon, the AG-2 Taubina, used a 40.6 mm {{round with}} a {{fragmentation}} grenade {{based on the}} standard Dyakonov, fitted with a <b>flangeless</b> sleeve. The Taubina was magazine-fed and could fire single shots or bursts either in either direct or indirect fire. The rate of fire of earlier models, already substantial at 50 to 60 rounds per minute, was later increased to about 436 rounds per minute, although the magazine was initially just five rounds.|$|E
50|$|The Class NG15 2-8-2 {{locomotive}} was {{a development}} of the Class Hd and Class NG5 locomotives which had been acquired for the Otavi Mining and Railway Company in SWA in 1912 and 1921 respectively. In the 1920s, one of the Class NG5 locomotives {{was sent to the}} Avontuur Railway in South Africa for trials, but since it jammed on the tighter curves in the Langkloof despite having one set of <b>flangeless</b> coupled wheels, it was returned to SWA.|$|E
50|$|The {{trailing}} truck allows a larger, deeper firebox {{than that of}} a 2-10-0. Like all ten-coupled designs, the long rigid wheelbase of the coupled wheels presented a problem on curves, requiring <b>flangeless</b> drivers, lateral motion devices and much sideplay on the outer axles. To limit this problem, the coupled wheels were generally small, up to 64 in in diameter, which in turn generated the problem of insufficient counterweights to balance the weight of the driving rods.|$|E
50|$|A {{number of}} Fairlie {{locomotives}} were built, including Taliesin for the Ffestiniog Railway and Josephine {{one of the}} NZR E class (1872). During 1870 the company supplied the first locos to run in Japan, and a <b>flangeless</b> 0-4-0T for a steelworks in Tredegar which was still using angle rails. A number of Matthew Kirtley's double-framed goods engines were also produced for the Midland Railway. The healthy export trade continued, particularly to India and South America, and continued after World War I.|$|E
