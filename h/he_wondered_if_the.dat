500|$|When it {{was decided}} that Kashimashi: Girl Meets Girl would begin {{serialization}} in MediaWorks' manga magazine Dengeki Daioh, Satoru Akahori wondered what kind of a message he could send to the readers, and eventually decided he wanted to write a steady message of [...] "true love". Akahori noted that up to the creation of Kashimashi, the works that he created were far apart from the concept of true love, and much of his previous work involved a lot of ecchi content which Akahori was attempting to avoid in Kashimashi. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> story would be interesting, and if he could surprise normal readers and fans of his previous works, if he wrote a true love story without much ecchi or fan service.|$|E
500|$|Several celebrities did {{not abide}} by the rules and were banned from the club. Humphrey Bogart was banned after a {{prolonged}} [...] "shouting match" [...] with Billingsley. Milton Berle was officially barred for too much table-hopping, shouting, and doing handsprings in the club; Berle contended that the real reason was because of a Stork Club satire he had recently performed on his television program. Elliott Roosevelt, the so-called [...] "black sheep of the club", became unwelcome at the club through an apparent misunderstanding. [...] Billingsley had planned an engagement party for Roosevelt and his girlfriend, vocalist Gigi Durston, {{on the basis of}} the couple's friends' statements that they were going to be married. [...] Durston had once worked at the Stork Club as a singer and Roosevelt was a longtime customer of the club. [...] Billingsley sent out publicity notices about the party; the couple told him that they had no plans to announce their engagement at that time. Roosevelt was banned from the Stork and the party was canceled. Jackie Gleason, who was a frequent guest of the club with his two daughters, was being seated with a female companion when the couple was asked to leave the premises in March 1957. Billingsley claimed that Gleason's conversation became loud and off-color when he arrived at a table and barred Gleason from the Stork Club for life. [...] Gleason said that he had done nothing wrong. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> problem was because he was a member of the Musicians' Union, since the club's wait and kitchen staff had been on strike since January of that year.|$|E
2500|$|Accordingly, Ribbentrop {{concluded}} that {{the time had come}} for the four powers (Germany, the Soviet Union, Italy and Japan) to define their [...] "spheres of interest." [...] He stated that Hitler had {{concluded that}} all four countries would naturally expand [...] "in a southerly direction." [...] Ribbentrop said <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Soviets might turn southward toward the sea, and when Molotov inquired [...] "which sea?", [...] Ribbentrop stated that [...] "in the long run the most advantageous access to the sea for Russia could be found {{in the direction of the}} Persian Gulf and the Arabian Sea." ...|$|E
50|$|At the funeral, Donald {{stands beside}} Mona. Back {{at his office}} in Brentwood, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> others are aware he is a {{different}} person. He knows that he and Isabel have become strangers.|$|R
50|$|Noureddin is now {{suspicious}} {{that the}} talisman should be preferred to the wealth {{he could have}} offered and feels {{that there is some}} mystery connected to it. <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> slave-owner's tongue might be loosened with wine and, calling his bodyguard Djemil, whispers his orders.|$|R
50|$|The narrator {{thinks the}} man's story might be genuine, {{and gives him}} his {{business}} card, but although he has some communication {{with him for a}} period, he does not see the man again. Reflecting later on <b>the</b> encounter, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> man is dead, or will perhaps re-emerge and become famous; <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> missed a business opportunity.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes, {{it served}} him right," [...] {{answered}} Henry, {{but even as}} he spoke he had to shudder, and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Indian was really dead or only partly choked to death.|$|E
60|$|Sometimes <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{ship had}} crossed the broad Atlantic to deposit him upon some wild South American shore; but the {{presence}} of Numa, the lion, decided him that such could not be the case.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> master {{had seen}} the little episode which had taken place {{immediately}} before his arrival. Then he remembered that it had happened inside the court. It must have been over by the time Mr Spence had come upon the scene.|$|E
60|$|He {{is not a}} man much {{addicted}} to sentiment or speculation, but sometimes when his day's work is done, and he strays to his garden gate and looks out at the dim and peaceful English landscape beyond, and thence to the wide star-strewn heavens above, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> hour will ever come when once more he will see those dark and passionate eyes, and hear that sweet remembered voice.|$|R
60|$|Before {{proceeding}} to this extremity, he listened intently. It must be near three o'clock, and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> all <b>the</b> others had left.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the first}} dream, Willow says to a monkey, [...] "L'hippo a piqué ton pantalon" [...] (French: [...] "The hippo stole your trousers"). This refers {{back to her}} {{conversation}} with Oz {{near the end of}} [...] "What's My Line, Part Two," [...] in which, intentionally absurd, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> hippo animal cracker is jealous because the monkey is the only animal cracker with pants, and asserts, [...] "All monkeys are French." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Rovers {{would gain}} {{possession}} of the treasure before the Baxter party came up, and also wondered what would happen should the two parties come together. He had not been treated very well by Dan Baxter, and so he hardly cared who came out on top {{in the struggle for}} the treasure.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> sun {{shining in}} his eyes made him think he saw more than he really did see, so he {{carefully}} changed his position. It made no difference. Then Spotty was sure that what he saw was real, {{and that he had}} found the cause of the trouble in the Laughing Brook, which had made it stop laughing and the Smiling Pool stop smiling.|$|E
60|$|A thin {{streak of}} light showed {{underneath}} the door. As St. Genis walked rapidly toward it <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> door would be locked. That certainly was a contingency {{which had not}} occurred to him. His design was to surprise a wounded and helpless thief in his sleep and to force him then and there {{to give up the}} stolen money, before he had time to call for help.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> all <b>the</b> {{fighting}} men had sallied forth in one supreme effort to rout the foe, leaving the city all unguarded. He asked their host.|$|R
50|$|Ferdinand leaves town after {{receiving}} a letter from his father. Several months later, he {{send a letter to}} Lewis saying that he has seen his singer, and has found out that she is to marry another man. Upon recognizing Ferdinand, she faints into the arms of Professor X———. Lewis finds this especially strange, since Professor X——— hasn't once left town in <b>the</b> intervening time. <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Turk's prophecy has in fact been fulfilled by psychic bonds making their way into everyday life.|$|R
60|$|As he {{uttered the}} last words, Dan Pickley looked at Ralph closely. <b>He</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> boy had overheard {{much of the}} {{conversation}} which had passed between Squire Paget and himself {{that night in the}} library.|$|R
60|$|But {{again he}} was doomed to be thwarted by one vital weakness--he {{did not know}} the gryf, and before the night was over <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> things never slept, for wheresoever he moved they moved also, and always they barred his road to liberty. Finally, just before dawn, he relinquished his {{immediate}} effort and sought rest in a friendly tree crotch in the safety of the middle terrace.|$|E
60|$|You see Peter {{knew that}} if he had found a strange Rabbit in his dear Old Briar-patch he {{certainly}} would have tried his best to drive him out, for he felt that the Old Briar-patch belonged to him. Now <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> maker of these tracks would {{feel the same way about}} the Old Pasture. Peter looked troubled as he thought it over. Then his face cleared.|$|E
60|$|So shaken was he, however, {{that though}} he tried once and yet again, {{he found it}} {{impossible}} to settle himself down to work till he had taken a couple of glasses of sherry from the decanter in the cupboard. Even as he did so <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> shadow of the sword disturbed him so much, how he would be affected if it ever was his lot to face the glimmer of its naked blade.|$|E
60|$|They {{questioned}} the prisoner closely {{and he said}} he felt certain he was on the right trail. But he was shy about saying more. <b>He</b> was <b>wondering</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> coming night would offer any opportunity of escaping.|$|R
500|$|... "Dwight's Speech" [...] {{received}} mostly positive reviews. Michael Sciannamea of TV Squad {{wrote that}} <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Jim-Pam [...] "will reach {{some sort of}} resolution or become a season-ending cliffhanger". Sciannamea also noted that [...] "you know you're living in a Bizarro World when Dwight wins Dunder Mifflin's salesman of the year award." [...] M. Giant of Television Without Pity graded the episode with an [...] "A–." [...] Francis Rizzo III of DVD Talk felt that Dwight's enlarged role was great, but noted that the episode was not as funny as his [...] "strange behavior" [...] in [...] "The Injury." ...|$|R
50|$|Rusty goes to Benny’s {{and finds}} out that Patty is now dating his friend Smokey. Smokey had set Rusty up by {{inviting}} the other girls to get Patty to break up with him. Instead of being angry, Rusty envies Smokey for being smart enough to think up {{that kind of a}} plan. B. J. tells Rusty that Motorcycle Boy is in the pet store looking at the fish. Rusty goes to the pet store, and the two watch the fish. Motorcycle Boy calls them rumble fish because they would kill each other <b>if</b> they could. <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> fish would still act that way if they were in the river.|$|R
6000|$|... "What do you hear, Yaqui?" [...] asked Gale. He {{laughed a}} little at the mood that had come over him. But {{the sound of his}} voice did not break the spell. He did not want to speak again. He yielded to Yaqui's subtle nameless influence. He listened himself, heard nothing but the scream of an eagle. Often <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Indian could hear things that made no sound. Yaqui was beyond understanding.|$|E
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> {{storm was}} as bad {{on the river}} and in the Boy's Town, and whether the {{lightning}} would strike the boat or the house; the house had a lightning-rod, but the boat could not have one, of course. He felt pretty safe about his father and the older-younger brother who had been left at home with him; {{but he was not}} sure about his mother and sisters, and he tried to imagine what people did on a steamboat in a thunder-storm.|$|E
60|$|The valley was {{an ideal}} retreat for an outlaw band {{operating}} on a big scale. Pursuit scarcely need be feared over the broken trails of the Rim Rock. And the open end of the valley could be defended against almost any number of men coming down the river. Access to Mexico was easy and quick. What puzzled Duane was how Bland got cattle down to the river, and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> rustler really did get rid of his stolen stock by use of boats.|$|E
60|$|He {{laughed at}} her designation, both pleased and taken aback by her praise... But <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> she knew <b>the</b> extent of his {{criticism}} of her father.|$|R
5000|$|In a 1999 {{interview}} to the Vima newspaper, Foskolos said that <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> political reality in Greece has surpassed {{even his own}} screenplays {{and said that he}} thinks that Greek society has [...] "fallen into a vertical aquarium of corruption". He said than in one scene of his film Koinonia, Ora Miden (Society, Hour Zero) a corrupt politician offers millions to Nikos Kourkoulos, who was playing the role of the honest hero of the film, to buy his silence for a crime committed by his cohorts. The politician told the hero that the price they had to pay was selling their conscience for their livelihood. Foskolos then remarked that the story he wrote for the film turned out to be prescient in the years that followed.|$|R
6000|$|... "Alex, {{come back}} here," [...] <b>he</b> said, and <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> lad had good stuff in him. The boatman's face was plain, but not evil, {{and a close}} {{scrutiny}} of it rather prepossessed the colonel.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Hang it,' thought Jim, 'this isn't {{playing the}} game at all. Why talk shop, {{especially}} that particular brand of shop, here?' <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> Head intended to describe the burglary, and then spring to his feet with a dramatic wave of the hand towards him, and say, 'There, Mrs MacArthur, is the criminal! There lies the viper on whom you have lavished your hospitality, the snaky and systematic serpent you have been induced by underhand means to pity. Look upon him, and loathe him. He stole the cups!' ...|$|E
60|$|Her {{companion}} made no answer. With {{the reserve}} {{that must be}} maintained on several points, the story {{would be difficult to}} relate; and it could not fail to be painful to her. The horror she would feel if she ever learned that her brother might have been saved had his cousin shown more resolution was a thing he dare not contemplate, and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> shock the knowledge must bring could be spared her. This depended upon Lisle, whom he had promised to assist. Nasmyth could foresee nothing but trouble, and he was silent for a while as they drove on across the lonely moor.|$|E
60|$|Once more he {{took his}} rope and {{vanished}} into the jungle. This time he hunted nobler quarry--man; although had you asked him his own opinion he could have named a dozen other denizens of the jungle which he considered far the superiors in nobility of the men he hunted. Today Tarzan was in quest of weapons. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> women and children had remained in Mbonga's village after the punitive expedition from the French cruiser had massacred all the warriors in revenge for D'Arnot's supposed death. He hoped that he should find warriors there, for he knew not how long a quest he should have to make were the village deserted.|$|E
50|$|McGavin {{heads the}} other team and goes to Tavurvur, an active volcano on New Britain. He sees a brahminy kite hunting over the grey ash-covered landscape, and finds an adult {{rhinoceros}} beetle {{and one of the}} larva in a tree stump. He sees megapode birds digging in the warm ash to bury eggs, and when they have finished he uncovers and reburies a large oval egg. He finds scavenger crabs before spectacular volcanic activity forces the team to evacuate the area. After this, McGavin goes to New Guinea and a helicopter takes him to the rim of Mount Bosavi. He reports on the dangers of climate warming and of humans to the wildlife as he watches an ornate fruit-dove. He sets up a night-light which attracts hundreds of moths, and he suspects many are not known to science. As the helicopter arrives to collect him from <b>the</b> summit, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>the</b> rainforest and its biodiversity will be destroyed.|$|R
60|$|STEVE. 'Oh, very well.' First {{he thinks}} there is {{something}} innocent about her request, and then <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> 'innocent' is <b>the</b> right word. 'Well, your business, please?' he demands, like {{the man of the}} world he hopes some day to be.|$|R
50|$|When Ellen {{arrives at}} the Cliff of Sidhe, she sees a cloaked figure resting at the edge. Thinking it is her mother, she calls out to the figure, {{but it does not}} reply. Keats arrives on the scene then, and asks Ellen <b>if</b> she was <b>the</b> one who called him. When she, surprised, says no, <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> aloud <b>if</b> <b>the</b> figure at the cliff was the one who called him.|$|R
