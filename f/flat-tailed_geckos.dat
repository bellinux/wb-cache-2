50|$|Uroplatus is a genus of geckos, {{commonly}} referred to as leaf-tail geckos or <b>flat-tailed</b> <b>geckos,</b> which are endemic to Madagascar and its coastal islands, such as Nosy Be. They are nocturnal, insectivorous lizards found exclusively in primary and secondary forest.|$|E

50|$|The <b>flat-tailed</b> day <b>gecko</b> (Phelsuma serraticauda) is a diurnal gecko {{lives in}} eastern Madagascar.

50|$|Then, the <b>Flat-tailed</b> <b>Gecko</b> (Cosymbotus platyuurus), {{a species}} {{strongly}} related to the Frilly Gecko, {{is another example of}} intermediacy. It similarly folds skin along the head, body, limbs, and tail as the Frilly Gecko but not nearly as developed. It lays these flaps out on the trunk of the tree to prevent the curving of the body from a shadow where it meets the trunk, to give away its location. These flaps inertly open up like other geckos do when the gecko jumps from one branch to another and this imparts even a small advantage by extending the length of the jump.|$|R
5000|$|Its adult size is 2.6 to 6 inches (66 to 152 mm) {{in total}} length, {{including}} the tail. As with all Uroplatus geckos the tail is flattened, but the leaf-like appearance is only {{seen in the}} ebenaui complex (U. phantasticus, U. ebenaui, and U. malama; although the tail size is much reduced in U. ebenaui). It has often been debated whether U. phantasticus {{is in fact the}} same species as U. ebenaui (the Nosy BÃ© <b>flat-tailed</b> <b>gecko).</b> However U. phantasticus possesses more, and longer, spines on the head, body and trunk. Other members of the genus Uroplatus have flattened tails that serve more to diminish the profile of the gecko while it is inactive. Some U. phantasticus geckos even have notches in their tails to further mimic a decaying leaf. [...] This is also thought to be a form of sexual dimorphism, as the trait seems more common in the males of the species. In addition, U. phantasticus has an eyelash-like projection above each eye. During daylight hours, these adaptations help the gecko blend into its surroundings. At night it helps the gecko hunt for prey by providing camouflage.|$|R
