For example, the 1961 Pickup <b>kit</b> <b>box</b> illustrated both the Ford and the Chevy, but the kit inside the box was identified by a label affixed to the outside. In the early 1960s AMT's 3-in-1 Trophy kit instructions usually came with short biographies of popular customizers of the day such as Bill Cushenberry, Dean Jeffries, Alex Kraus, Gene Winfield, the Alexander Brothers and of course George Barris, {{most of whom were}} employed by AMT. Gene Winfield even closed his California shop to work with AMT (Cawthon 2002). Also, instruction sheets for some kits had a section with customizing hints by George Barris exclusively. An extreme example was the 1957 Ford Thunderbird kit. The instructions included five pages devoted to “stylizing”, a practice of adding parts by using body putty and sanding which went beyond ordinary customizing. Included in the '57 T-Bird kit were additional street rod, drag and Bonneville styling ideas all suggested by George Barris.|$|E

40|$|El Aissaoui Abdellah (2015). A {{feasibility}} study of direct injection spraying technology for Small Scale Farming: Modeling {{and design of}} a process control system. University of Liege-Gembloux Agro-Bio Tech. Belgium. 175 p., 11 tabl., 75 fig. The study aims to develop a process controller of direct injection spraying system (DIS) that can fit to carry out precise chemical application using variable rate application based on speed sensing {{in the context of}} small scale farming. It has the specific objectives of studying the feasibility of DIS by optimizing the hydraulic system and the process control designs as the main requirements for the best system reactivity and performance. The final design of DIS assessed to implement hydraulic system (hardware) and process controller (software) of a sprayer framework mounted on a rolling chariot propelled by walker operator. A logical approach is used of reviewing the state of art and formulating a specification book to develop a cost effective prototype to eventually adapt DIS expertise to the context of small scale farming. The demarche consists on giving low cost solution of variable rate technology to solve the technical problems related to usage and inefficiency of pesticide application mainly done by portable sprayers. The state of art gives a light on the development process of direct injection spraying technology (DIS) within the scope of precision agriculture progress. It also deals with technical options, advantages and problems related to DIS and control engineering solutions developed for improving spraying application efficiency and safety measures for human and environment. After that we have specified requirements of the researched DIS prototype by referring to existing art of DIS technologies and by diagnosing problems of chemical application in the context of small scale farming. It concerns specifically the technical requirements, setting values and performance of DIS process controller according to the working conditions of intensive cropping in small farming. The materials and methods consist on presenting the approach used for modeling the DIS prototype (splitting the problematic to the two main design aspects of hydraulic system and process control system) and evaluating it in laboratory conditions using simulated velocity data input. The data acquisition system is implemented for assessing the performance of DIS hydraulic and process controller performances. After that, the process controller is implemented in a cost effective electronic <b>kit</b> (<b>box)</b> to be mounted on a small sprayer framework propelled by worker. The hydraulic modeling of DIS served for optimizing the lag transport task as main problem of system reactivity performance and concentration process change. An algorithm is implemented in VB program to assess effect of hydraulic serial boom design (diameter and number of mounted nozzles in serial scheme) on flow dynamic to find compromise between lag transport, mixing ability (turbulence) and friction loss tasks that yield lateral and longitudinal uniformities application of standard boom layout. The modeling results showed lag transport and uniformity of respectively 2 s and 96 % for optimal conventional boom of 6 mm inner diameter having ten tip nozzles (ISO 11003, 1. 2 L/min~ 3 bars). To solve systematic problem of lateral miss uniformity of serial boom layout (standard scheme), improved parallel boom layout (equidistant tubing lines of 4 mm diameter) is adopted for obtaining an even lag transport between nozzles. The test of parallel boom layout showed even lag transport approximating 1. 5 s for ten mounted nozzles. The total response time of DIS is optimally improved to be within 2. 5 s by installing electrical pumps close to boom and injecting chemical in suction side to the carrier pump assumed to perform online mixing without use of static mixer. The PID feedback controller is modeled in MATLABTM software. The process is considered as a first order process having a time constant of 0. 2 s and a delay transport less than 2 s. Two control strategies of constant carrier flow control (CCFC) and total flow control (TFC) are modeled and implemented for test in laboratory conditions. Both strategies were tested and evaluated on the basis of different solicitations of variable speed input within the range of 0 - 2 m/s as a field working condition of walker operating a rolling sprayer chariot. Finally, {{on the basis of the}} results of modeling and experimental assessment, an affordable kit of PLC process controller and PWM modules for actuating carrier pump and metering pump is performed in compact electronic box for potential usage on small sprayer framework to be propelled by walker operator in agricultural field. The controller is based on a PLC microcontroller implemented for carrying out a constant carrier flow rate and a variable chemical injection rate proportionally to the operating speed. The prototype is tested for applying variable rate application using simulated step solicitations within the range of the operator working conditions of 0 - 2 m/s. The study showed the feasibility of implementing a cost effective process controller design for applying variable rate chemical in small farming context. The controller is adaptable for sprayer mounted on wheeled chariot to be propelled by worker assumed to walk at variable velocity...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—The {{automation}} of kitting tasks—collecting a set {{of parts}} for one particular car into a kit—has a huge impact in the automotive industry. It considerably increases the automation levels of tasks typically conducted by human workers. Collecting the parts involves picking up objects from pallets and bins as well as placing them in the respective compartments of the <b>kitting</b> <b>box.</b> In this paper, we present a complete system for automated kitting with a mobile manipulator thereby focusing on depalletizing tasks and placing. In order to allow for low cycle times, we present particularly efficient solutions to object perception as well as motion planning and execution. For easy portability to different platforms, all components are integrated into a skill-based framework that is tightly coupled with a task planning component. We present results of experiments at both a research laboratory environment and at the industrial site of PSA Peugeot Citroën serving as a proof of concept for the overall system design and implementation.

The RAAKS (Rapid or Relaxed Appraisal of Agricultural Knowledge Systems) is a participatory action-research methodology developed by Paul G H Engel to support and enhance innovation processes in agriculture. Shared knowledge, alliances and networking are some of the key words of this methodology, to which many experts and field workers contributed. The textbook entitled The social organization of innovation - a focus on stakeholder interaction describes the concepts and theoretical background, as well as lessons learned from multiple case studies. The manual, Networking for innovation - a participatory actor-oriented methodology, addresses the method itself and gives a brief introduction to building an efficient RAAKS team. The set of laminated cards in a binder, Windows and Tools, is designed to help in gathering, organizing and interpreting information in a participatory manner. Together, the manual and cards provide a menu of field-tested methodological elements for development teams to use in their work to promote innovation. This book will be of interest to researchers, university lecturers, managers and extension agents.
