The series' scheduling was {{a landmark}} for both ABC and Miller/Boyett Productions, as all four TGIF programs that season were produced by Miller/Boyett: Full House, Family Matters, Perfect Strangers, and <b>Going</b> <b>Places.</b> Being a more adult entry into the all-Miller/Boyett lineup of mostly family-oriented shows, <b>Going</b> <b>Places</b> met with a slower audience growth during its first few months. Despite having Perfect Strangers as its lead-in, which remained a Top 20 show, <b>Going</b> <b>Places</b> lost a lot of that audience on a weekly basis, and came in at #50 during November sweeps, which paled in comparison to the other TGIF programs.|$|R

500|$|An {{enthusiastic}} review {{came from}} The Wire, which felt that: [...] "In the end, Vespertine commits its magic by daring to <b>go</b> <b>places</b> more obvious and more human than {{one would have}} ever expected." [...] Calling it [...] "one {{of the most impressive}} and cohesive" [...] albums of the year, Tiny Mix Tapes found Vespertine to be Björk's most effective use of the studio as an instrument. Simon Reynolds, praised it in Uncut saying [...] "Her best yet, {{it reminds me of the}} jackfrost wonderland of Cocteau Twins circa In The Gold Dust Rush, of the bejewelled coldness of Siouxsie and the Banshees circa A Kiss in the Dreamhouse. The glittering sound fits the album's idea of inner riches, the treasure people keep hidden inside." [...] Katy Widder, writer for PopMatters, believed the album was a masterpiece, stating that it challenged the predominant theories of rock music and gender, particularly a statement made by Simon Reynolds and Joy Press in the acclaimed book, The Sex Revolts: Gender, Rebellion, and Rock 'n' Roll: [...] "Women have seized rock 'n' roll and usurped it for their own expressive purposes, but we've yet to see a radical feminization of rock itself." [...] Chris Smith of Stylus Magazine praised the album for its nuance and delicacy, describing its sonic palette as [...] "a breath of fresh air." [...] Noting that Vespertine showed a more mature side of the singer, musicOMH's Michael Hubbard wrote that [...] "It sounds like Björk has grown up while that would be a pity, it is also fascinating for anyone who loves her music. She is a legend in her time." ...|$|E
