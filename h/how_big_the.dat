Without proper graphic scaling, it was unclear <b>how</b> <b>big</b> <b>the</b> map's hazard zones really were. The lahars on the map did not have a distinct ending point, and the main threat seemed to be from pyroclastic flows, not from mudflows. Though the map was colored blue, green, red, and yellow, there was no key to indicate what each color represented, and Armero was located in the green zone (believed to indicate the safest area.|$|E
5|$|Halo 2 {{was officially}} {{announced}} in September 2002 with a cinematic trailer, subsequently packaged with Halo: Combat Evolved DVDs. A real-time gameplay video was shown at E3 2003, {{which was the}} first actual gameplay seen by the public; it showcased new features such as dual-wielding and improved graphics. Many elements of the trailer, however, were not game-ready; the entire graphics engine used in the footage had to be discarded, and the trailer's environment never appeared in the final game due to limitations on <b>how</b> <b>big</b> <b>the</b> game environments could be. The restructuring of the engine meant that there was no playable build of Halo 2 for nearly a year, and assets and environments produced by art and design teams could not be prototyped.|$|E
5|$|Development of Thracia 776 started {{around the}} {{beginning}} of 1998, with the initial plan being for a compact side project to Genealogy of the Holy War. Development was also supposed to end a considerable time prior to its eventual release date, but as the game evolved, the staff {{felt the need to}} keep going and create a full Fire Emblem title. This in turn caused difficulties with keeping the game within the world of Genealogy of the Holy War, with Kaga commenting {{that it would have been}} simpler to create a completely original title if they had known <b>how</b> <b>big</b> <b>the</b> project would become. Characters were intentionally given little buildup or backstory, leaving their individual personalities for players to imagine. As the strategic war simulation elements of Genealogy of the Holy War had suffered due to the goal of creating an intricate story, Kaga this time switched his focus to the gameplay. The basic structure was taken from , with additional elements such as branching pathways within maps and variations in unit movement. This was achieved by giving each map a different algorithm to work with. The fatigue system was introduced to challenge players further.|$|E

Rising upward could be achieved a number of ways, such as by gaining wealth, by gaining skill in some department, by qualifying for a learned profession, by showing conspicuous valour, or by performing some service to the community.

25|$|Little-endian {{representation}} simplifies hardware in processors {{that add}} multi-byte integral values a byte at a time, such as small-scale byte-addressable processors and microcontrollers. As carry propagation must {{start at the}} least significant bit (and thus byte), multi-byte addition can then be carried out with a monotonically-incrementing address sequence, a simple operation already present in hardware. On a big-endian processor, its addressing unit has to be told <b>how</b> <b>big</b> <b>the</b> addition {{is going to be}} so that it can hop forward to the least significant byte, then count back down towards the most significant byte (MSB). On the other hand, arithmetic division is done starting from the MSB, so it is more natural for big-endian processors. However, high-performance processors usually fetch typical multi-byte operands from memory in {{the same amount of time}} they would have fetched a single byte, so the complexity of the hardware is not affected by the byte ordering.|$|E
25|$|In King Henry III's long reign (1216–1272) the short-cross penny {{continued}} in use until 1247. By then, however, {{through no fault}} of the moneyers' there was a problem in that many of the coins in circulation were underweight. This was caused by the illegal practice of clipping silver {{off the edge of the}} coin, which was made easier by the cross on the reverse not extending to the rim thus giving people no clear indication of exactly <b>how</b> <b>big</b> <b>the</b> coin was supposed to be. In 1247 therefore, a new long-cross penny replaced the short-cross coin, which made it more obvious when the coin had been clipped. Apart from the change in the size of the cross, the rest of the design did not substantially change, and the long cross made it easy to cut the coin into halves or quarters for change. Because of the introduction of the new coinage it was necessary to reopen many of the old mints to supply sufficient coins. Short-cross Henry III pennies were minted at Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Durham, London, Winchester and York. Long-cross pennies were produced at Bristol, Bury St Edmunds, Canterbury, Carlisle, Durham, Exeter, Gloucester, Hereford, Ilchester, Lincoln, London, Newcastle, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Shrewsbury, Wallingford, Wilton, Winchester, and York.|$|E

25|$|Oftentimes in {{the natural}} history of a species, large body size confers {{reproductive}} advantage. This raises the question in Hemipepsis ustulata: why do smaller wasps persist? Generation after generation, there is a wide size variation among these tarantula hawks. Wasps do not grow after metamorphosis, so smaller animals are at a permanent disadvantage competing against their larger fellows. John Alcock’s studies emphasize the importance of size variation in claiming desirable territories among male Hemipepsis ustulata wasps. It is hypothesized that female provisioning behavior {{may play a role in}} the maintenance of size variation in this species. In tarantula hawks, the size of the offspring is determined by the mother’s decision on how much to invest in each offspring. The size of the tarantula captured by the mother wasp is a function of <b>how</b> <b>big</b> <b>the</b> larva will become when fully grown. The subduing of a larger tarantula requires a greater energy investment and poses a greater risk to the mother wasp. If the offspring is a large male, it would have to be twice as fit as a smaller male offspring in order to repay the investment of the mother wasp. Thus, in some cases, it may be advantageous for the mother wasp to produce many small male offspring. This would enable them to enjoy the same level of fitness as a female, but with fewer, larger progeny.|$|E

These different districts with different administrations constituted the officially recognised extent of London as a whole. In 1665, he revised his estimate to 'not above 460,000'.

Fitzgerald, in her first major television role, began filming for the soap in May 2006 and made her first on-screen appearance in July. Fitzgerald's mother commented on her daughter's casting: [...] "Personally, I feel I want to show how proud we are of her and to thank everyone who has prayed for her and helped her in any way. At first, it is just the look they go for. Then it is more intensive and she had to read from a script. By the second audition, she was still up against 60 or 70 people. You start thinking about it when she gets to the third audition, but when the agent rang up and said she had got the part it was an overwhelming feeling. You don't know what it means until that point". Fitzgerald was offered the part about three months after her final audition. As Fitzgerald was only 10 years old when she got the part, she was required to balance her filming requirements with schooling in Northampton, and learning lines. In 2012, she told Inside Soap that she thought she had messed up her audition, and did not realise <b>how</b> <b>big</b> <b>the</b> show was until she was older. In 2014, she told BBC Radio 1 that when she met Wood and Joyner, her on-screen parents, she realised it did not matter that she had messed up her lines in her last audition, because she looked like them both. Fitzgerald was required to cry on her first day of filming, and admitted in 2014 that this was embarrassing, and she was unable to produce tears, but was [...] "just making noises".
