40|$|AbstractThe {{synthetic}} peptide GK- 1, derived from Taenia crassiceps, enhances the protection induced by human <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> in both young and aged mice.

25|$|Present {{vaccination}} {{strategies for}} SIV {{control and prevention}} in swine farms typically {{include the use of}} one of several bivalent SIV vaccines commercially available in the United States. Of the 97 recent H3N2 isolates examined, only 41 isolates had strong serologic cross-reactions with antiserum to three commercial SIV vaccines. Since the protective ability of <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> depends primarily on the closeness of the match between the vaccine virus and the epidemic virus, the presence of nonreactive H3N2 SIV variants suggests current commercial vaccines might not effectively protect pigs from infection with a majority of H3N2 viruses. The United States Department of Agriculture researchers say while pig vaccination keeps pigs from getting sick, it does not block infection or shedding of the virus.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the high}} {{lethality}} and virulence of HPAI A(H5N1), its endemic presence, its increasingly large host reservoir, and its significant ongoing mutations, the H5N1 virus has recently been regarded to be the world's largest current pandemic threat, {{and billions of dollars}} are being spent researching H5N1 and preparing for a potential influenza pandemic. At least 12 companies and 17 governments are developing prepandemic <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> in 28 different clinical trials that, if successful, could turn a deadly pandemic infection into a nondeadly one. Full-scale production of a vaccine that could prevent any illness at all from the strain would require at least three months after the virus's emergence to begin, but it is hoped that vaccine production could increase until one billion doses were produced by one year after the initial identification of the virus.|$|E
25|$|High {{levels of}} {{immunity}} in one age group can create herd immunity for other age groups. Vaccinating adults against pertussis reduces pertussis incidence in infants {{too young to}} be vaccinated, who are at the greatest risk of complications from the disease. This is especially important for close family members, who account for most of the transmissions to young infants. In the same manner, children receiving vaccines against pneumococcus reduces pneumococcal disease incidence among younger, unvaccinated siblings. Conversely, vaccinating children against pneumococcus and rotavirus has had the effect of reducing pneumococcus- and rotavirus-attributable hospitalizations for older children and adults, who do not normally receive these vaccines. Influenza (flu) is more severe in the elderly than in younger age groups, but <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> lack effectiveness in this demographic due to a waning of the immune system with age. The prioritization of school-age children for seasonal flu immunization, which is more effective than vaccinating the elderly, however, has shown to create a certain degree of herd immunity for the elderly.|$|E

40|$|Despite {{the fact}} that <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> is an importanthealth resource, the {{structure}} and organization of the USvaccine manufacturing system has produced <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> shortages or distribution delays in five {{out of the last}} six influenza seasons.

In so doing, local health officials are confronted with significant practical and legal constraints associated with allocating a resource that is largely not under direct government control. In the face of an impending <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> shortage, local public health departments endeavor to do three things: (1) assess the local supply of vaccine, (2) assess the local demand from high-risk community members, and (3) ensure that to the greatest extent, the limited local supply of vaccine is used exclusively by those at highest risk within the local jurisdiction.

2500|$|There are two serious {{technical}} {{problems associated with}} the development of a vaccine against H5N1. The first problem is this: seasonal <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> require a single injection of 15 μg haemagluttinin in order to give protection; H5 seems to evoke only a weak immune response and a large multicentre trial found that two injections of 90µg H5 given 28 days apart provided protection in only 54% of people [...] Even if it is considered that 54% is an acceptable level of protection, the world is currently capable of producing only 900million doses at a strength of 15 μg (assuming that all production were immediately converted to manufacturing H5 vaccine); if two injections of 90 μg are needed then this capacity drops to only 70million [...] [...] Trials using adjuvants such as alum, AS03, AS04 or MF59 to try and lower the dose of vaccine are urgently needed. [...] The second problem is this: there are two circulating clades of virus, clade 1 is the virus originally isolated in Vietnam, clade 2 is the virus isolated in Indonesia. Vaccine research has mostly been focused on clade 1 viruses, but the clade 2 virus is antigenically distinct and a clade 1 vaccine will probably not protect against a pandemic caused by clade 2 virus.|$|E
2500|$|In the United States, {{countries}} in the European Union {{and a few other}} affluent countries, thiomersal is no longer used as a preservative in routine childhood vaccination schedules. In the U.S., the only exceptions among vaccines routinely recommended for children are some formulations of the inactivated influenza vaccine for children older than two years. Several vaccines that are not routinely recommended for young children do contain thiomersal, including DT (diphtheria and tetanus), Td (tetanus and diphtheria), and TT (tetanus toxoid); other vaccines may contain a trace of thiomersal from steps in manufacture.. The multi-dose versions of the <b>Influenza</b> <b>vaccines</b> Fluvirin and Fluzone can contain up to 25 micrograms of mercury [...] per dose from Thiomersal. [...] Also, four rarely used treatments for pit viper, coral snake, and black widow venom still contain thiomersal. Outside North America and Europe, many vaccines contain thiomersal; the World Health Organization has concluded that {{there is no evidence of}} toxicity from thiomersal in vaccines and no reason on safety grounds to change to more expensive single-dose administration. [...] The United Nations Environment Program backed away from an earlier proposal of adding thiomersal in vaccines to the list of banned compounds in a treaty aimed at reducing exposure to mercury worldwide. [...] Citing medical and scientific consensus that thiomersal in vaccines posed no safety issues, but that eliminating the preservative in multi-dose vaccines, primarily used in developing countries, will lead to high cost and a requirement for refrigeration which the developing countries can ill afford, the UN’s final decision is to exclude thiomersal from the treaty.|$|E

In investigations published {{in the last ten years}} [21, 23 - 37] the frequency of allergic reactions to vaccine was 2.62 % in 6532 subjects (Table  1).

Therefore, egg allergy of any severity (including anaphylaxis) is not a contraindication to the administration of <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine.</b> However, <b>influenza</b> <b>vaccine</b> should be administrated when resuscitation facilities are available, and the patient should be observed in the office for 30  minutes after immunization [19].
