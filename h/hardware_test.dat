50|$|Generated {{random numbers}} are {{sometimes}} subjected to statistical tests before use {{to ensure that}} the underlying source is still working, and then post-processed to improve their statistical properties. An example would be the TRNG9803 hardware random number generator, which uses an entropy measurement as a <b>hardware</b> <b>test,</b> and then post-processes the random sequence with a shift register stream cipher. It is generally hard to use statistical tests to validate the generated random numbers. Wang and Nicol proposed a distance-based statistical testing technique that is used to identify the weaknesses of several random generators.Li and Wang proposed a method of testing random numbers based on laser chaotic entropy sources using Brownian motion properties.|$|E
50|$|In earlier BIOSes, up {{to around}} the turn of the millennium, the POST would perform a {{thorough}} test of all devices, including a complete memory test. This design by IBM was modeled after their larger (e.g. mainframe) systems, which would perform a complete <b>hardware</b> <b>test</b> as part of their cold-start process. As the PC platform evolved into more of a commodity consumer device, the mainframe- and minicomputer-inspired high-reliability features such as parity memory and the thorough memory test in every POST were dropped from most models. The exponential growth of PC memory sizes, driven by the equally exponential drop in memory prices, was also a factor in this, as the duration of a memory test using a given CPU is directly proportional to the memory size.|$|E
40|$|Abstract—Smart Grid is {{a complex}} cyber-physical system that modernizes the {{traditional}} electric power infrastructure by sensing, control, computation and communication. Validating the functionality, security and reliability of Smart Grid applications within such a system requires the modeling and emulation of both power networks and communication networks, {{as well as the}} interactions between them. In this paper, we present the design, implementation and evaluation of an integrated scalable cyber-physical experiment environment for Smart Grid, called ScorePlus. Compared with previous related works, ScorePlus fills the gap by: 1) Creating and integrating both software emulator and <b>hardware</b> <b>testbed,</b> such that they all follow the same architecture and interface, and the same Smart Grid application program can be tested on either of them without any modification; 2) Providing remote access to the <b>hardware</b> <b>testbed</b> such that users can configure physical devices of the <b>hardware</b> <b>testbed</b> through Internet; 3) Supporting scalable distributed experiments such that multiple software emulators and hardware testbeds running at different locations are able to connect and form a larger Smart Grid system.

40|$|The {{precision}} {{time keeping}} system (TKS) in the Global Positioning System (GPS), Block IIR satellites {{is designed to}} operate under severe natural and man made environmental conditions. The Block IIR TKS provides precise, autonomous time keeping for periods of up to seven months, without {{the intervention of the}} GPS Control Segment. The TKS is implemented using both linear and non-linear controls. The resulting TKS architecture uses a hybrid analog/digital phase locked loop (PLL). The paper provides details of the design and analysis of the TKS. The simulation techniques and the test bed activities used in performing the TKS design trade-offs are described. The effects of non-linear controls are analyzed using a TKS computer simulation of the PLL. The results from a <b>hardware</b> <b>test</b> bed are provided that verify desired TKS operation.

40|$|The <b>Hardware</b> <b>Test</b> Program for {{evaluation}} of the baseline range/range rate sensor concept was initiated 11 September 1984.

The objective of the added program phase is to establish range and range measurement accuracy and radar signature characteristics for a typical spacecraft target. Phase I of the <b>Hardware</b> <b>Test</b> Program was designed to reduce {{the risks associated with}} the Range/Range Rate (R/R) Sensor baseline design approach. These risks are associated with achieving the sensor performance required for the two modes of operation, the Interrupted CW (ICW) mode for initial acquisition and tracking to close-in ranges, and the CW mode, providing coverage during the final docking maneuver. The risks associated with these modes of operation {{have to do with the}} realization of adequate sensitivity to operate to their individual maximum ranges...|$|E
