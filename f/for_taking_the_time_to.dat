5000|$|Parnell {{was first}} elected to the Alaska House of Representatives, in 1992 {{at the age of}} twenty-nine. He {{represented}} a district in Anchorage that included at that time, Independence Park, Dimond Blvd., and the Southport/Bayshore ares of Anchorage. After his first year in the State House, Parnell was named the [...] "Most Effective Freshman Legislator" [...] by his colleagues and those who worked in the State Capitol. This recognition arose because Parnell was known <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> help other legislators hone and pass their legislation and in doing so, learned the legislative process and developed relationships with his colleagues. In 1994, Parnell was re-elected to represent South Anchorage in the Alaska House. Throughout his four years in the Alaska House of Representatives, Parnell was known for his work on the House Finance Committee and in the fight against domestic violence and sexual assault in Alaska. During those years he sponsored and passed seminal legislation known as the Domestic Violence Prevention Act of 1996 that was Alaska’s first consistent, comprehensive statewide policy on this issue.|$|E

5000|$|Thank you {{for your}} {{petition}} regarding the former inhabitants of the Chagos Archipelago. The U.S. recognizes the British Indian Ocean Territories, including the Chagos Archipelago, as the sovereign territory of the United Kingdom. The United States appreciates the difficulties intrinsic to {{the issues raised by}} the Chagossian community.In the decades following the resettlement of Chagossians in the late 1960s and early 1970s, the United Kingdom has taken numerous steps to compensate former inhabitants for the hardships they endured, including cash payments and eligibility for British citizenship. The opportunity to become a British citizen has been accepted by approximately 1,000 individuals now living in the United Kingdom. Today, the United States understands that the United Kingdom remains actively engaged with the Chagossian community. Senior officials from the United Kingdom continue to meet with Chagossian leaders; community trips to the Chagos Archipelago are organized and paid for by the United Kingdom; and the United Kingdom provides support for community projects within the United Kingdom and Mauritius, to include a resource center in Mauritius. The United States supports these efforts and the United Kingdom’s continued engagement with the Chagossian Community.Thank you <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> raise this important issue with us." ...|$|E
5000|$|On {{release of}} the console port, Famicom Tsūshin scored the Sega Saturn version of the game a 30 out of 40, before giving it first an 8 out of 10 and later a 9 out of 10 in their Reader Cross Review. The two sports reviewers of Electronic Gaming Monthly gave the Saturn version scores of 8 and 7.5 out of 10, noting some {{problems}} with the frame rate and animation but declaring it an overall good conversion. One of the reviewers particularly applauded Sega of America <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> <b>to</b> polish up the North American version so that it plays better than the rushed Japanese version. GamePro praised the addition of Saturn mode and mirror mode and the strong gameplay of the core game. They concluded that [...] "Daytona pales in comparison with Ridge Racer for the Japanese PlayStation, which takes an early lead with better features, gameplay, and graphics. ... Regardless, Daytona's intense gameplay and breathtaking graphics will exhilarate any racing fan." [...] Maximum commented on the Saturn version's low-resolution texture mapping, clipping, large borders (in the PAL release), and lack of multiplayer, before adding that [...] "we'd be doing you a disservice by not mentioning {{every one of these}} deficiencies, {{but the truth of the}} matter is: it's not that important. Gameplay is what it's all about and in this respect Daytona USA is an unmitigated triumph." [...] in original They applauded the challenging track design and realistic game mechanics, particularly mentioning the impact of wind resistance, and gave the game 5 out of 5 stars. Sega Saturn Magazine also gave the Saturn version 5 out of 5 stars, saying that the game is graphically impressive aside from the pop up and has strong arcade-style gameplay.|$|E

40|$|When human {{listeners}} tap {{their feet}} in time to music, they are performing beat track-ing. Automatic beat tracking {{has been the subject}} much interest in the the research community, but tracking higher-level metre such as measure has received less atten-tion. This dissertation presents Metanome, which uses an autocorrelation technique to try to determine the boundaries of measure in a musical audio signal for which beat (tactus) locations are known. It achieves a success rate of 81 % for music with time signatures corresponding to metrical groupings of two, but further experimentation is required to see if it can work as effectively for other time signatures. iii Acknowledgements I would like to thank my supervisor, Mark Steedman, <b>for</b> <b>taking</b> <b>the</b> <b>time</b> and trouble to supervise my project, and for his helpful comments.
