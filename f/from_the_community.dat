5|$|In {{its early}} years, the library {{received}} book donations {{from the village}} Sunday school and the Club. In July 1928, the library moved <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>Community</b> Center building to the tower room of the former Briarcliff Farms office building, currently {{a branch of the}} International Union of Operating Engineers. The Community Center building was sold in October 1929 for $16,000; these funds were required to be used for recreational purposes. Thus, the organization gave $11,000 to the village for the construction of the Law Memorial Park pool, and $5,000 to the library. Upon the building's sale and the Club's dissolution, the library was reconstituted as an association library with a 15-member board of trustees.|$|E
5|$|North of Wemple, the {{sporadic}} residences {{along the}} highway are replaced by a string of tank farms serving barges on the Hudson River. The industrial surroundings follow NY144 into the hamlet of Glenmont, centered on the route's junction with Glenmont Road. Here, NY144 crosses over another set of railroad tracks before heading northeastward <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> toward Normans Kill. The route runs alongside the Hudson River tributary and another set of tank farms to an intersection with NY32 (Corning Hill Road) near the Port of Albany–Rensselaer, where the NY144 designation terminates. NY32 continues northward {{from this point on}} NY144's right-of-way, becoming South Pearl Street and immediately crossing Normans Kill to enter the city of Albany.|$|E
5|$|One of Greer Stadium's most {{distinctive}} features was its guitar-shaped scoreboard.

While plans for First Tennessee Park's scoreboard were initially undisclosed, following overwhelming support for Greer's guitar <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> the team announced plans for a larger, more modern guitar-shaped scoreboard for the new ballpark. The new guitar scoreboard, paid for entirely by the Sounds, was designed by TS Sports in conjunction with Panasonic, and was installed beyond the right-center field wall on the concourse.|$|E

5|$|Ruth {{is portrayed}} as being strong-willed, {{determined}} and loyal. She is also a New Woman and a farmer, traits that made her {{stand out from the}} other female characters in The Archers {{at the time of her}} introduction. In later years, Ruth has mellowed and is more open to negotiation. Her storylines have often revolved around her marriage to David and her work on Brookfield Farm. In the early 2000s, the scriptwriters had Ruth and David isolate themselves <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> during a foot-and-mouth outbreak. Ruth was also diagnosed with breast cancer, a storyline which Finch undertook extensive research for and later named as one of her Archers highlights.|$|E

5|$|The {{main purpose}} for kulintang {{music in the}} {{community}} is to function as social entertainment at a nonprofessional, folk level. This music is unique {{in that it is}} considered a public music in the sense everyone is allowed to participate. Not only do the players play, but audience members are also expected to participate. These performances are important in that they bring people in the community and adjacent regions together, helping unify communities that otherwise may not have interacted with one another. Traditionally, when performers play kulintang music, their participation is voluntary. Musicians see performances as an opportunity to receive recognition, prestige and respect <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> and nothing more.|$|E
5|$|All of {{the protagonists}} {{in the novel}} are misfits and social outcasts {{surrounded}} by an impersonal and largely antagonistic rural community, which is represented metonymically through minor or anonymous characters. Joanna Burden and Reverend Hightower are hounded {{by the people of}} Jefferson for years, in a failed effort to make them leave town. Byron Bunch, though more accepted in Jefferson, is still viewed as a mystery or simply overlooked. Both Joe Christmas and Lena Grove are orphans, strangers in town, and social outcasts, though the former draws anger and violence <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> while the latter is looked down upon but receives generous assistance in her travels. According to Cleanth Brooks, this opposition between Joe and Lena is a pastoral reflection of the full spectrum of social alienation in modern society.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, {{planning}} {{continued for}} the construction of the route, as well as modifications to the existing roadway. The City of La Mesa began discussions regarding adding SR 125 from SR 94 to I-8 into the scenic highway system in 1968; the county Planning Commission continued pursuing these plans in 1970. SR 125 was lengthened by the Legislature to extend to the Mexican border in 1972. In 1973, then-governor Ronald Reagan vetoed a bill to delete part of SR 125 from state plans, over concerns that not enough transportation studies had been done on the matter. An improved interchange with SR94 was being planned the next year. Soon after, Caltrans raised concerns about the remainder of SR 125 not being constructed, due to objections <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> relating to freeway construction in general.|$|E

5|$|Indigenous {{people of}} the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes have {{inhabited}} the area for hundreds of years. In pre-contact times, these people lived a nomadic lifestyle. They did not build permanent structures in which to live, as they moved from region to region to find food and resources. Animals such as caribou, martin, moose and caribou were hunted and trapped by the Dakelh and Tsilhqot'in tribes. In summer, these people gathered roots, plants and a volcanic glass called obsidian. Anahim obsidian was traded widely throughout the Interior {{and up and down}} the Coast <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> of Bella Coola. Arrowheads and knives were made from obsidian because when it breaks with a characteristic conchoidal fracture, it creates very sharp edges. A modified form of this lifestyle is practiced by some indigenous people to this day.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the boys}} at St. Mary's played {{baseball}} in organized leagues {{at different levels of}} proficiency. Ruth later estimated that he played 200 games a year as he steadily climbed the ladder of success. Although he played all positions {{at one time or another}} (including infield positions generally reserved for right-handers), he gained stardom as a pitcher. According to Brother Matthias, Ruth was standing to one side laughing at the bumbling pitching efforts of fellow students, and Matthias told him to go in and see if he could do better. Ruth had become the best pitcher at St. Mary's, and when he was 18 in 1913, he was allowed to leave the premises to play weekend games on teams that were drawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community.</b> He was mentioned in several newspaper articles, for both his pitching prowess and ability to hit long home runs.|$|E
5|$|Mukund Raj {{was another}} poet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> {{who lived in}} the 13th century and {{is said to be the}} first poet who {{composed}} in Marathi. He is known for the Viveka-Siddhi and Parammrita which are metaphysical, pantheistic works connected with orthodox Vedantism. Other well known Deshastha literary scholars of the 17th century were Mukteshwar and Shridhar. Mukteshwar was the grandson of Eknath and is the most distinguished poet in the ovi meter. He is most known for translating the Mahabharata and the Ramayana in Marathi but only a part of the Mahabharata translation is available and the entire Ramayana translation is lost. Shridhar Kulkarni came from near Pandharpur and his works are said to have superseded the Sanskrit epics to a certain extent. Other major literary contributors of the 17th and the 18th century were Vaman Pandit, Mahipati, Amritaraya, Anant Phandi and Ramjoshi.|$|E

5|$|On announcing {{its plans}} for Steam Direct, Valve {{suggested}} the fee {{would be in}} the range of $100–5,000, meant to encourage earnest software submissions to the service and weed out poor quality titles that are treated as shovelware, improving the discovery pipeline to Steam's customers. Smaller developers raised concerns about the Direct fee harming them, and excluding potentially good indie games from reaching the Steam marketplace. Valve opted to set the Direct fee at $100 after reviewing concerns <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community,</b> recognizing the need to keep this at a low amount for small developers, and outlining plans to improve their discovery algorithms and inject more human involvement to help these. Valve then refunds the fee should the game exceed $1,000 in sales. In the process of transitioning from Greenlight to Direct, Valve mass-approved most of the 3,400 remaining titles that were still in Greenlight, though the company noted that not all of these were at a state to be published. Valve anticipated that the volume of new games added to the service would further increase with Direct in place. Some groups, such as publisher Raw Fury Games and crowd funding/investment site Fig, have offered to pay the Direct fee for indie developers who can not afford it.|$|E
5|$|The Bureau of Land Management (BLM) administers most {{land in the}} Trout Creek Mountains, {{but there}} are also some private lands and some roads in the area. The private lands are mainly used for {{ranching}} along mountain streams, while the BLM lands include large grazing allotments for local ranchers' cattle. At least 100 mining claims in the mountains have been recorded since 1892, some of which were staked for gold exploration. Commercial mining has occurred in some areas, mostly near the McDermitt Caldera, where uranium and large amounts of mercury have been extracted. Mines in what was called the Opalite Mining District produced 270,000 flasks of mercury—"the richest supply of mercury in the western hemisphere"—from cinnabar extracted from the caldera in the 20thcentury. The two leading mercury-producing mines in North America were the Cordero and McDermitt mines {{on the edge of the}} caldera in Nevada. Together, they operated from 1933 to 1989. The McDermitt Mine, the last mercury mine in the United States, closed three years later, in 1992. However, mineral exploration has continued at the Cordero Mine in the 21stcentury, and waste containing mercury and arsenic was returned there <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>community</b> of McDermitt as part of a U.S. Environmental Protection Agency cleanup project.|$|E
