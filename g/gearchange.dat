25|$|The Chevette's 1.3 litre {{engine and}} {{relatively}} small bodyshell allowed for good performance. The Chevette had a light steering, clutch and <b>gearchange,</b> {{as well as}} good visibility and was spacious inside. The Chevette's success was probably due to its versatility, which compared well with larger cars like the Ford Escort. It was available in three-door hatchback for the single driver, and saloon models which suited families, estate car for the service fleets and the 'Chevanne', van version for all other utility purposes.|$|E
2500|$|A {{different}} type of dual-clutch transmission {{has been used in}} some railcars. The two clutches are placed one on the gearbox input shaft and the other on the gearbox output shaft. To make a gear change, both clutches disengage simultaneously and a brake inside the gearbox engages. [...] The <b>gearchange</b> occurs with all gears stationary, so no synchronizing mechanism is needed. [...] After the gear change, both clutches re-engage. There is a significant break in power transmission, so this system is unsuitable for shunting locomotives.|$|E
2500|$|Both the Roadster and Roadster Coupé are {{available}} in Brabus-tuned versions with power increased to [...] The Brabus versions have a different twin sports exhaust, lower suspension, polished six-spoke aluminum alloy Monoblock VI 17" [...] wheels (205/40 ZR17 at the front and 225/35 ZR17 at the rear), front spoiler, side skirts and radiator grille. Exclusive Brabus (Xclusive) interior includes leather trimmed dashboard, alloy-effect accent parts, instrument graphics, leather/aluminium gearknob with Brabus labelled starter button, aluminium handbrake handle (which fouls the central armrest), aluminium pedals and Brabus labeled floor mats. The Brabus version also features stronger clamping of the clutch plates and a faster <b>gearchange.</b> The Monoblock wheels {{are known to be}} very soft and as a result are very easy to buckle. The lacquer on these wheels is also very poor, and corrosion can occur very early {{in the life of the}} wheel.|$|E
50|$|Most {{competitors}} use normal road cars {{but some}} use specially built vehicles (motorkhana specials) which are much lighter and have specialised braking systems {{to facilitate the}} spin turns. Some motorkhana specials use modified automatic transmissions to facilitate rapid <b>gearchanges</b> between first and reverse gears. They usually use racing slick tyres for bitumen and concrete surfaces.|$|R
50|$|In 1941, LPTB were {{allocated}} ten 'unfrozen'TD7 Titans (STD 101-11), {{which received}} early Ministry of Supply Utility Style bodies by Park Royal Vehicles. Their heavy flywheels and slow <b>gearchanges</b> made them umpopular with drivers. The London Fire Brigade, {{and some other}} Fire Brigades, {{as well as the}} National Fire Service also had Titan TD7s fitted with turntable ladders (see above).|$|R
50|$|The third {{version of}} INVECS was further advanced, and now offered a {{continuously}} variable transmission when in fully automatic mode, or a six-speed clutchless manual if the driver wished to control the up- and down-shift points. A further innovation for Mitsubishi was the introduction of paddle shifters allowing the driver to make manual <b>gearchanges</b> while their hands remain on the steering wheel.|$|R
2500|$|As with {{previous}} Minicars, the Mark C was improved and developed over time with numerous minor changes. Most notably, Villiers replaced the 6E engine with the 8E version in June 1953. This {{had the same}} overall capacity, but slightly increased performance, now [...] In October 1953 a new Triplex windscreen and surround was introduced, the dashboard glove box was removed, a two-roll seat replaced the earlier round top variety and the old <b>gearchange</b> and steering shaft u/j's were eliminated. Steel was sometimes used for rear wings when supplies of aluminium became difficult to obtain. The following October's updates redesigned the braking system, introduced rear bumpers on the Tourer models and front bumpers for all Deluxes. Several more minor changes in October 1955 were marked by a much more notable change {{to the shape of}} the front grille from the familiar oval to a more angular design (designated Type II).|$|E
2500|$|For the 1953 racing season, Amm debuted the {{controversial}} Norton Kneeler 350cc motorcycle at the 1953 North West 200 Race. Despite overheating problems the Norton Kneeler with the nickname the [...] "Amm Sandwich" [...] or [...] "Silver-Fish", Amm finished in 9th {{place in the}} 350cc class that was eventually won by Bob McIntyre at an average race speed of 86.86mph. Despite testing the Norton Kneeler for practice for the 1953 Isle of Man TT Races, Amm reverted to the non-steamlined Norton motorcycles due to handling problems with cross-winds on the Mountain Section of the course and also opposition by the TT Race Scrutineers. It proved a good choice as Amm won the 1953 Junior TT Race at an average race speed of 90.52mph from Ken Kavanagh in 2nd place and Fergus Anderson in 3rd place. [...] Another win in the 1953 Senior TT Race for Amm at an average race speed of 93.85mph completed a prestigious Junior/Senior TT double win for the works Norton team. Following Amm during the 1953 Senior TT Race, Geoff Duke commented on Amm's distinctive riding style;- [...] "After I had caught and passed Ray Amm on the Norton, he passed me at Ballugh when I missed a <b>gearchange!</b> Then there was the frightening experience of following him {{to the end of}} the lap, Ray could be pretty lurid when he was trying!" [...] A fall at the 1953 French Grand Prix at Rouen in the 350cc class broke a collar-bone and brought about a premature end to championship ambitions for Amm for the 1953 Grand Prix motorcycle racing season. However, Amm returned to the abortive Norton Kneeler project in November 1953 to set a number of world speed records at Montlhéry, France rasing the hour speed endurance record to a distance of 133.70miles. Also at Montlhéry in November 1953, Amm shared a streamlined Norton Sidecar outfit with Eric Oliver to set further speed records.|$|E
5000|$|The {{transmission}} {{also featured}} an automatic system. If the [...] "auto-up" [...] button is pressed, {{which could be}} at any time on the circuit, it will do automatic changes until the next time drivers call for a <b>gearchange</b> with the levers. The software is so programmed that it recognises when a driver calls for a <b>gearchange</b> before the automatic system is ready {{to do so and}} immediately hands back control to the manual system.|$|E
50|$|The Viva {{comes with}} 3-cylinder engine choices: 660 cc, 850 cc and 1000 cc. They are {{familiar}} engines but updated with modern technology such as DVVT (Dynamic Variable Valve Timing) and EFI, {{and they all}} have twin overhead camshafts to provide even stronger low-speed pulling power, resulting in fewer <b>gearchanges,</b> yet also manages to increase top end power. Other innovations include a resin port intake manifold and a head cover incorporating an air-cleaner casing.|$|R
50|$|The car was {{unveiled}} {{to the public}} on January 6, 2008. It features a new standard Electronic Control Unit (ECU), which is the electronic system that controls all the cars, produced by McLaren Electronic Systems. This was included {{to comply with the}} new regulations. The ECU also removes most of the driver aids used in previous seasons, including traction control, engine braking and electronically assisted starting system. It also makes the management of the differential, engine and <b>gearchanges</b> easier.|$|R
40|$|Due {{to factors}} such as high power density and efficiency, low torque ripple and maintenance, and {{extremely}} wide operating speed range, permanent magnet AC motors (PMAC) {{are the subject of}} intense development for traction drive applications. Maximum torque production for both traction performance and electronic <b>gearchanging</b> requires the operating condition to be as close to voltage saturation as possible in the flux weakening region. A fully dynamic model reference flux-weakening controller with feedback linearisation decoupling is presented, which allows the maximum torque-speed trajectory to be followed dynamically, without saturation of the current controller...|$|R
50|$|Transmission: 4-speed gearbox, {{synchromesh}} in 3rd and top from 1932. Right hand <b>gearchange.</b> Single {{dry plate}} clutch. Open drive propeller shaft.|$|E
50|$|The Crown Comfort is {{a popular}} taxicab in Japan and Hong Kong. It uses a rear-wheel-drive drivetrain. Some {{versions}} can be licensed to carry five passengers (excluding the driver). The six-seat version uses column <b>gearchange</b> whereas the five-seat version can either have column or floor <b>gearchange.</b> The Japanese model has fender mirrors and an automatic (driver-activated) rear door (also standard in Hong Kong). The Comfort also is used as an instructional vehicle for people learning how to drive.|$|E
50|$|The main Rootes Group {{dealers in}} Leicester, Castles of Leicester, offered a {{conversion}} that moved the <b>gearchange</b> to the transmission tunnel, modified the cylinder head, fitted a bonnet air scoop {{and changed the}} way the boot lid opened. These models were not connected with the Sunbeam factory but are {{sometimes referred to as}} the Mk IIIS. Some 30-40 cars were modified. The revised <b>gearchange</b> was also offered as an after market accessory and was suitable for fitting to earlier models also.|$|E
50|$|The Ten was {{followed}} in its turn in 1957 by the Standard Pennant featuring very prominent tail fins, but otherwise little altered structurally from the 1953 Standard Eight. An {{option for the}} Ten, and standard fitment to the Pennant, was the Gold Star engine, tuned for greater power and torque than the standard 948 cc unit. Another tuning set, featuring a different camshaft and twin carburettors, was available from dealers. As well as an overdrive for the gearbox, an option for the Eight, Ten and Pennant was the Standrive, a semi-manual transmission that automatically operated the clutch during <b>gearchanges.</b>|$|R
50|$|First {{released}} in 2010, all new MC's are delivered race prepared by Maserati technicians. Entrants who use private teams must have their cars homologated {{to meet the}} equal settings of the in-house raced MC's. It features aerodynamic enhancements and weight reduction over the GranTurismo S which it was originally based upon. It has a base price of €155-158.000 excl. VAT, but includes technical support throughout the initial season. The MC can also be run in all GT4 class racing series. It has around 488 bhp and <b>gearchanges</b> are dealt with in 60 ms. For 2012 the MC has a revised aero package encompassing amongst other minor changes a large rear wing.|$|R
50|$|Secondly drivers newly {{allocated}} {{the type}} had not driven a vehicle of equivalent power before and most were not {{trained in the}} use of the semi-automatic gearbox which lacked the engine-braking effect of a 'solid' transmission. This resulted in many engine losses due to overspeeding, there was no easy way to control this as the pure 'fluid flywheel' form of transmission was used rather than a Leyland SCG-style lock-up clutch. Problems with the braking and transmission fed back on one another and exacerbated engine damage. PMT altered the change-speed control on some of its buses from electrical to pneumatic to slow down <b>gearchanges</b> but at the time and with the transmission system fitted there was no way to install an effective secondary braking system.|$|R
5000|$|The 1300/1500 were {{conventional}} cars, with longitudinally, front-mounted engines powering {{the rear}} axle via a four-speed manual transmission with a column <b>gearchange.</b> The engines employed were {{two versions of}} the same design, differing mainly in bore: ...|$|E
5000|$|... 1952 - 1956 - Ape B: {{similar to}} the A model but with a 150 cc engine, a pressed steel cargo bed, front fork mounted {{to the right of}} the wheel hub and cable {{operated}} <b>gearchange.</b>|$|E
50|$|UniTrol (or Uni-Trol) was a {{patented}} Gilson Brothers {{innovation in}} snowblower drive linkage that allows {{operation of the}} clutch and <b>gearchange</b> with a single lever. It was introduced in 1969 and was available on Gilson snowblowers until 1979.|$|E
5000|$|Also in 1993, the Automobile Association road {{tested the}} turbo diesel. Their verdict: [...] "You're hardly likely {{to buy a}} Maestro diesel to improve your street cred! For turning heads, the 218/418 diesel {{is a much better}} proposition. However, disinterested {{passengers}} love the back seat, while the driver can relish the model's marked reluctance to visit filling stations. Here's a hatchback for buyers who are really serious about the substance rather than the image - and with a price tag that's thousands of pounds lower than most of its rivals (shown in our comparison chart), you start saving even before your first forecourt stop. Unless you're averse to <b>gearchanging,</b> this unpretentious Maestro turbo-diesel, at its competitive price, can't seriously be faulted." ...|$|R
5000|$|Larrousse {{began the}} year with drivers Érik Comas, who had raced for the team the {{previous}} year, and Olivier Beretta, an F1 rookie who paid for his seat after experience in Formula 3000. The year began promisingly, with Comas taking 13th place on the grid at the Brazilian Grand Prix, and scoring {{a point in the}} next race at Aida. However, the regulation changes following the San Marino Grand Prix resulted in development work on the car ceasing, which coincided with a run of engine failures for both cars from the Spanish Grand Prix through the middle of the season. Despite the efficient <b>gearchanges</b> provided by the Benetton transmission, which in Comas' words made it [...] "fun to drive the car", the LH94 suffered from abiding understeer and poor traction. As the team's rivals made progress throughout the year, Larrousse gradually sank towards the back of the grid. Comas did, however, manage to score another point at the attritional German Grand Prix.|$|R
5000|$|The Lotus 76 was a Formula One car {{designed}} by Colin Chapman, Tony Rudd and Ralph Bellamy for the 1974 Formula One season. The car {{was intended to}} be a more advanced version of the Lotus 72, powered by the Ford Cosworth DFV and featuring modified aerodynamics, a lighter chassis, longer wheelbase and a narrower, lower monocoque. The car also featured a bi-plane rear wing, designed to increase rear downforce and stability. Additionally it had an electronically operated clutch, which was the precursor to the modern semi automatic gearboxes seen on today's F1 cars, with the control mounted into the gearstick which theoretically speeded up <b>gearchanges.</b> The Lotus 76 was seen as a major technological breakthrough by Team Lotus. Outwardly, the car looked sleek and impressive. Internally, the suspension set up and inboard brake positioning were carried over from the Lotus 72. The car's development had been paid for by title sponsor John Player Special, so the 76 was given the chassis number 'John Player Special Mk I.' ...|$|R
50|$|Also {{standard}} was a chrome mesh front grille, front lip spoiler, quickshift <b>gearchange,</b> side sill plates and RB320-branded gear knob, carpet mats and exclusive exterior badging. Each owner will also receive an individually numbered black alloy tax disc holder.|$|E
50|$|The new seven-speed Instantaneous <b>GearChange</b> (ICG) gearbox is Renault's {{first attempt}} at a {{seamless}} shift gearbox. It proved to be very reliable with Kovalainen making only one retirement all season, which was due to an accident in the Brazilian Grand Prix.|$|E
50|$|An {{overlooked}} {{factor is}} that many TCUs also have a signal from the cruise control module in order to change <b>gearchange</b> behaviour {{to take into account}} the throttle is not being operated by the driver, this eliminates unexpected gearchanges when the cruise control is engaged.|$|E
40|$|Fuel {{consumption}} reduction {{is one of}} the main challenges in the automotiveindustry due to its economical and environmental impacts as well as legalregulations. While fuel {{consumption reduction}} is important for all vehicles,it has larger benefits for commercial ones due to their long operational timesand much higher fuel consumption. Optimal control of multiple energy buffers within the vehicle proves aneffective approach for reducing energy consumption. Energy is temporarilystored in a buffer when its cost is small and released when it is relativelyexpensive. An example of an energy buffer is the vehicle body. Before goingup a hill, the vehicle can accelerate to increase its kinetic energy, which canthen be consumed on the uphill stretch to reduce the engine load. The simplestrategy proves effective for reducing fuel consumption. The thesis generalizes the energy buffer concept to various vehicular componentswith distinct physical disciplines so that they share the same modelstructure reflecting energy flow. The thesis furthermore improves widely appliedcontrol methods and apply them to new applications. The contribution of the thesis can be summarized as follows: • Developing a new function to make the equivalent consumption minimizationstrategy (ECMS) controller (which {{is one of the}} well-knownoptimal energy management methods in hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs)) more robust. • Developing an integrated controller to optimize torque split and gearnumber simultaneously for both reducing fuel consumption and improvingdrivability of HEVs. • Developing a one-step prediction control method for improving the <b>gearchanging</b> decision. • Studying the potential fuel efficiency improvement of using electromechanicalbrake (EMB) on a hybrid electric city bus. • Evaluating the potential improvement of fuel economy of the electricallyactuated engine cooling system through the off-line global optimizationmethod. • Developing a linear time variant model predictive controller (LTV-MPC) for the real-time control of the electric engine cooling system of heavytrucks and implementing it on a real truck.
