This project {{is part of a larger}} project (REFUGIA project) aiming at understanding the effect of pesticide use and agricultural intensity in Denmark on a variety of species using genetic, ecological and simulation tools. The main aim of my part of this project was the investigation of the effects of pesticide use and agricultural intensity on wild animal species in the agricultural landscape, with particular focus on testing the hypothesis that organic fields act as genetic reservoirs for the re-colonization of organic fields...|$|R
40|$|This thesis {{contains}} the main research result that was <b>done</b> during <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D <b>study</b> in Effros’s group.

First, I would like to thank Professor Michelle Effros for her guidance and patience through the work. From her, I learned the spirit of doing high quality research as well as thinking rigorously and originally. She provided support and encouragement in various ways. Her passion for research motivated me to work hard constantly. I gratefully acknowledge Professor Tracey Ho, Mayank Bakshi, and Soumya Jana for providing plenty of ideas from our discussions. Those ideas contributed greatly to this thesis. Professor Ho gave me a broad picture of the whole research topic. I learned from Mayank Bakshi much knowledge in the field of Source Coding.

40|$|The highly ordered TiO 2 {{nanotube}} arrays {{have demonstrated}} remarkable properties that include solar cells, hydrogen sensors, drug eluting surfaces, hydrogen generation, and water purification along with numerous other applications. Built upon a suitable fabrication approach that enable {{significant differences in}} reproducibility {{as well as the}} large scale production with low cost plus investigation of the effective way to increase its visible light response so that create environmental friendly alternative energy sources were the motivations of this work, Since the field has grown so rapidly as to make it difficult to summarize the scope of all related work, some key aspects on this field have been discussed and then mainly focus on the work that has been <b>done</b> during <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D <b>study.</b> This <b>Ph.</b> D work focuses on the most challenging issues: 1) improves the tune quality of highly ordered TiO 2 nanotubes by reproducible manner as well as reduces the cost of fabrication. 2) Investigates the different methods of modification in order to increase photo response of the materials in visible light region. 3) Explore the surface superhydrophobic property of fluorinated TiO 2 nanotubes layer. Following progresses have been made towards the target. An innovative technique of sonication assisted fabrication of highly ordered TiO 2 nanotubes in reproducible manner was proposed and the expensive platinum cathode was replaced by titanium by which the fabrication cost was reduced. A one-step method for the fabrication of Fe–C–N-codoped TiO 2 nanotubes by electrochemical anodization is reported. A maximum photocurrent efficiency of 2. 7 % was achieved. Highly ordered nitrogen-doped titanium dioxide (N-doped TiO 2) nanotube array films with enhanced photo conversion efficiency were reported and the conditions were optimized. The optimized experiment resulted in 7. 42 % PCE which was within 95 % confidence interval of the predicted value by the model. The structural and photo catalytic properties of Pt/ZIF- 8 loaded TiO 2 nanotubes (TiO 2 NTs) are investigated and compared to Pt/TiO 2 NTs. The Pt/ZIF- 8 loaded TiO 2 NTs has shown 18. 6 % oxidation towards phenol in 2 hours under visible light. Finally, a simple process of tailoring the surface wettability of TiO 2 nanotube array surface was proposed by which any desirable degree of hydrophobicity between 100 o to 170 o can be achieved...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{proposes a}} {{generalisation}} of pre-logical predicates to simply typed formal systems and their categorical models. We analyse the three elements involved in pre-logical predicates — syntax, semantics and predicates — within a categorical framework for typed binding syntax and semantics. We then formulate generalised pre-logical predicates and show two distinguishing properties: a) equivalence {{with the basic}} lemma and b) closure of binary pre-logical relations under relational composition. To test the adequacy of this generalisation, we derive pre-logical predicates for various calculi and their categorical models including variations of lambda calculi and non-lambda calculi such as many-sorted algebras as well as first-order logic. We then apply generalised pre-logical predicates to characterising behavioural equivalence. Examples of constructive data refinement of typed formal systems are shown, where behavioural equivalence {{plays a crucial role}} in achieving data abstraction. iii Acknowledgements First of all, I thank my supervisor Don Sannella for all aspects of <b>my</b> <b>Ph.</b> D. <b>study.</b> This thesis would not be here without his continuous support and encouragement.
