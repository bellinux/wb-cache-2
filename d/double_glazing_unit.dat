40|$|AbstractThis paper {{deals with}} the {{experimental}} assessment of the energy performance of two Advanced Integrated Façade modules (AIF) characterized by two very similar configurations. The two AIF modules were installed on the south-exposed façade of an outdoor test cell facility (a real-scale mockup of an office building) and continuous measurements were carried out {{for more than one}} year. Data collected during the experimental campaign were analyzed to evaluate the energy performance and thermo-physical behaviour of the AIF modules. The performances of the two systems were assessed by comparison and by means of conventional and advanced synthetic metrics. The results of the activity point out the different performances of the two configurations, which only differs on the inner-side glazing (a stratified single clear glass pane vs a stratified low-e <b>double</b> <b>glazed</b> <b>unit).</b> It was demonstrated that just a single additional glass layer can contribute to substantially improve the energy performance of a quite complex façade technology. On average, the façade configuration with the stratified low-e <b>double</b> <b>glazed</b> <b>unit</b> shows the abatement of heat loss and of solar gain of about 30 % during the whole year. Moreover, the reliability of some conventional and less conventional metrics in assessing the performance of dynamic façade technologies was also investigated.

40|$|Venetian blinds, {{which were}} {{originally}} designed to provide sun shading and privacy, also {{have the potential to}} reduce heat transfer caused by internal and external temperature difference when integrated within the cavity between the two panes of a <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>unit.</b> In this paper, the thermal performance of a glazing system with and without a Venetian blind with various slat orientation angles under different temperature conditions is investigated through both experiment (undertaken in a large climate chamber) and numerical simulation (obtained via Computational Fluid Dynamic modelling). The thermal resistance of a Venetian blind glazing system varies with the change of slat inclination angle, and it also highly depends on the mean temperature of the glazing and the temperature difference between the indoor and outdoor environment. Inclusion of a Venetian blind modifies both the absolute and relative strengths of convection and radiation. Vertically oriented slats showed the most significant contribution to increasing radiative thermal resistance, which led to the best overall thermal performance. The system achieved up to 28 % improvement of U-value when compared with a glazing unit without a Venetian blind. Empirical correlations generated based on simulations could be used for future building energy simulation...|$|E
40|$|The {{adoption}} of glazed façades in commercial building {{is becoming more}} and more widespread. The main limits of conventional transparent façades related to energy efficiency and IEQ aspects have been overcome developing a new generation of transparent building envelope components called Advanced Integrated Façades This paper evaluates if the thermal behaviour of this kind of technologies can be correctly assessed by means of conventional performance parameters. Data from experimental campaigns on a reflective double glazed unit and on a Climate Façade under actual operating conditions have been used to estimate the correspondent equivalent U-value and g-value. Subsequently, these parameters have been employed to calculate the energy balance of the same glazed façades. The validation of the parameters is then carried out through the comparison between experimental and simulated specific total hourly heat flux and specific total daily energy. The result shows that it is still acceptable to use conventional performance parameters for "simple" glazing technology (e. g. reflective <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>unit).</b> On the contrary, the {{adoption of}} such parameters in case of more advanced façade technologies leads to considerable inaccuracies and makes the predictions based on these metrics not reliabl...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{presents}} some of {{the research}} done during the last 8 years at the Technical University of Denmark developing improved low-energy window solutions. The focus has been on maximizing the net energy gain of windows for residential buildings. The net energy gain of windows is the solar gain minus the heat loss integrated over the heating season. It is assumed that in northern cold climates all of the solar gain during the heating season can be utilized for space heating. Problems with overheating in the summer period must be solved with overhang or moveable solar shading devices. Two windows have already been developed and prototypes constructed for laboratory test and a third generation of the window design is now in the developing and designing phase in a new project. The first window constructed was made of wood profiles and a low-energy <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>unit.</b> The second and third windows are made of fiber-reinforced plastic (plastic reinforced by fine fibers made of glass). This composite material is a weatherproof material with very low thermal conductivity and high mechanical strength. These properties make the material very suitable for frame profiles due to lower heat loss and longer durability of the window. The glazing in these fiber reinforced polyester windows is both unsealed and sealed triple glazing units. To increase the net energy gain slim frame profiles have been developed to increase the glazing area and thereby the solar gain. The challenge when developing slim frame profiles is to make enough space for hinges and fasteners and still maintaining the functionality and strength of the window. Proposals for new hinges and handles are also given in this paper. 1...|$|E

5000|$|Unique tower {{envelope}} made of cold-bent glass {{emphasizes the}} lightness and {{dynamic of the}} form visually denying the gravity force. Two hundred meters high sculpture, crafted of materials traditionally believed to be fragile and inflexible, symbolizes the idea of evolution spiral as the pinnacle of progress {{and the power of}} human intellect, challenging the forces of nature and the laws of physics. Original façade concept and innovative construction technology allow to create visually organic and flowing 3D form. Double curved tower envelope is provided by the cold bending of reflective glass units. The innovative cold-bent glazing in the curtain wall uses flat <b>double</b> <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> cold-formed in 3D within the aluminum frame to avoid stepping in geometry. This approach appeared to be both more energy-efficient and more cost-efficient solution in comparison to the stepped curtain wall units previously applied in some twisted unitized facades. During factory fabrication the glass unit is placed in the twisted aluminum frame horizontally and then takes curved shape by its own weight without any thermal treatment. Maximum corner deformation does not exceed 50 mm relative to the opposite corner of the unit. Finally façade looks like continuously twisted spiral glass surface. Currently this curtain wall is the world’s largest cold bent façade in terms of the area in one building. Organic cold-bent glazed ribbon with constant leaning angle at the corners (approx. 14 degrees vertically) creates a stunning optical illusion reflecting the surrounding cityscape vertically with 90-degree twist.Evolution tower total façade area is 40,500 sq m, including 34,500 sq m of the typical facade areas from 3-rd to 51-st level. On each floor the curtain wall consists of 108 parallelogram façade panels 4.3 m high and 1.5m wide. 27 of them have 2 types of different sizes that vary with twist angle from +14 to -14 that largely complicated the construction logistics. However the implementation of this façade structure was successful due to involvement of German façade company Joseph Gartner (Permasteelisa Group) in design and production of tower curtain wall, atrium glazing and canopies /entrances. The company was selected through the tender with 30 façade manufacturers competing for a prestigious contract. The aluminum profiles were extruded in Russia at a specially arranged production line. Despite glass units fabrication in Germany with all associated delivery and customs duties the overall façade cost per m2 remained within the budget of a ‘standard’ benchmark high-rise tower, that was an achievement of German logistics. <b>Double</b> <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> with energy-efficient multi-functional glass (manufactured by Guardian) provide the energy efficiency and thermal insulation parameters (U-Value) similar to those of standard triple <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> but with less weight in panoramic floor to ceiling application. The units themselves were assembled in Germany by BGT, who provided long-time warranty for cold bent heat-strengthened glass in a result of multiple tests. Transparent <b>double</b> <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> consist of triplex 8+6mm from heat-strengthened glass from the outside and 8mm Guardian Standard HP Neutral 60/40 tempered glass on the inside with application of energy efficient coating, significantly reducing the solar gain whilst providing the <b>double</b> <b>glazed</b> <b>unit</b> thermal performance equal to a standard triple <b>glazed</b> <b>unit</b> normally used in Moscow to withstand harsh winter conditions. Guardian SunGuard production technology allows to create almost perfect combination of transparent and spandrel façade areas. Guardian magnetron coating has a special feature - it is colored outside and transparent on the inside, which does not distort the view color unlike tinted glass in mass. With no color filter (color is from the coating, not from coloured glass) the high color quality provides comfortable environment inside the building given that the glass panel is 3m high (floor to ceiling) the perfect daylighting is provided in the office spaces. Glass unit formula with heat-strengthened triplex outside and tempered glass inside allows bending of the unit in installation position to achieve required façade geometry providing additional safety of envelope structure , as in case of destruction the tempered glass (5 times stronger than usual) is fractured in small pieces and triplex lamination film protects it from falling out. Heat strengthened glass triplex gains additional strength and reduces the risk of glass destruction via associated heat soak tests as part of the production process.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{explores the}} {{potential}} of thermotropic (TT) windows {{as a means of}} improving overall building energy performance. Capitalising on their ability to dynamically alter solar and visible light transmittance and reflectance based on window temperature, they have the ability to reduce solar heat gains and subsequently reduce cooling loads when the external conditions exceed those required for occupant comfort. Conversely when the external conditions fall short of those required for comfort, they maintain a degree of optical transparency thus promoting opportunities afforded by passive solar gains. To test their overall effectiveness, thermotropic layers made of varying hydroxypropyl cellulose (HPC) concentrations (2 wt. %, 4 wt. % and 6 wt. %) were firstly synthesised and their optical properties measured. Building performance predictions were subsequently conducted in EnergyPlus for four window inclinations (90 °, 60 °, 30 ° and 0 ° to the horizontal) based on a small office test cell situated in the hot summer Mediterranean climate of Palermo, Italy. Results from annual predictions show that both incident solar radiation and outdoor ambient temperature {{play a significant role in}} the transmissivity and reflectivity of the <b>glazing</b> <b>unit.</b> If used as a roof light, a 6 wt. % HPC-based thermotropic window has a dynamic average Solar Heat Gain Coefficient (SHGC) between 0. 44 and 0. 56, this lower than that of 0. 74 for <b>double</b> <b>glazing.</b> Predictions also show that in the specific case tested, the 6 wt. % HPC-based thermotropic window provides an overall annual energy saving of 22 % over an equivalent <b>double</b> <b>glazed</b> <b>unit.</b> By maintaining the thermotropic window spectral properties but lowering the associated transition temperature ranges, it was found that the lowest temperature range provided the smallest solar heat gains. Although, this is beneficial during periods where cooling may be needed, in those periods where heating may be required, opportunities gained through passive solar heating are limited. In addition, with lower solar heat gain, there is a possibility that artificial lighting energy demand increases resulting in additional energy consumption...|$|R

Different glazing materials commercially available both in the local and overseas market were compared with a common glass material used in Sri Lanka as the base case {{to investigate the}} energy use and the thermal comfort conditions in the building. The computer software tool, DEROB-LTH (version 99. 02) was used to evaluate the cooling energy use and thermal environment condition of the building. The cooling energy use was evaluated in terms of hourly, daily and monthly basis and the interior climate was evaluated in terms of the operative temperature. The simulation results have shown a positive conclusion towards the feasibility of using <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> with advanced solar-control coatings and it further showed that the common glazing material used in the Sri Lankan building industry; the single-clear glazing is not feasible in terms of energy cost and indoor thermal performances. The study also supports that a single-pane heat-absorbing type solar-control configuration can give comparatively moderate results; better results than that for the single-clear glazing type in local climatic conditions. Finally, an economic/cost-benefit analysis was performed in order to investigate the economic viability of applying the best performing, highly expensive, advanced solar-control glazing over the reference case; ordinary single-clear glazing, and it was found that this glazing is highly cost effective and worth paying for any orientation. However, it is noted that the initial capital cost of these advanced solar-control glass materials as well as the popularisation of this technology in the local scenario was identified as the major barrier for the development of this technology in Sri Lanka...|$|R
40|$|At the {{beginning}} of the planning phase of this project - about four years ago - granular aerogel was a new material produced on a small scale by BASF. Parallel to this product, a high-cost and high-quality material - aerogel in tile form - was under developement. In the course of this project it was shown that granular aerogel filled between <b>double</b> <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> has very interesting characteristics - both thermal and optical - which open up a large range of different applications. The production process was improved and stabilized. Medium-scale production (#propor to# 100 m" 3 /year) is now possible and the next larger plant is beeing discussed. At the same time a lot of work was done outside this project in the field of aerogel tiles. There were some improvements in the optical characteristics but no breakthrough in the costs, which would have to occur if production is to be expected in the future. The competition from high quality windows with low emissivity coatings and gas fillings or even vacuum windows seems to be too strong. By contrast, {{there seems to be a}} market for scattering windows like those filled with granular aerogel in special applications such as roof glazings, wall glazings etc. The test done during this project showed that aerogel windows can be produced with conventional window technology, if the manufacturing is done carefully. Of course there is further potential for improvement, firstly from the material side - lower level of scattering - and secondly from the technical side - better edge sealings and low conductivity frames. Demonstration projects have indicated the large potential. The next step to be taken is mediumscale production of modules by the window industry for demonstrating and testing on a larger scale.

Original doors have been replaced with pairs of single light aluminum storefront-type commercial entry doors. Aluminum panels face the recessed jambs. Windows are generally multipane (12/ 12) aluminum, single-hung except for a series of 1/1 triple <b>glazed,</b> <b>double</b> hung <b>units</b> (these have false muntins between the glazing in a 12/12 pattern) in the third floor, southwest wing judge's suite. A few original double-hung 12/12 wood windows are located at the second floor southwest wing of the original building, and a few small steel windows are in the roof penthouse.|$|R
40|$|Great {{interest}} {{has been shown}} {{over the last couple}} of decades, particularly within industrialised countries, in developing innovative glazing systems for energy-efficient buildings, either to reduce window heat loss in winter or solar heat gain in summer. In highly insulated assemblies, the constraints placed on the former are due to (i) edge-, frame- and spacer-induced heat losses, and (ii) external and internal surface resistances caused by the range of flow regimes found in the built environment. A thermal resistance network model is used to determine the so-called 'night-time' U-values of different assemblies that are typically measured by hot-box techniques. It treats the problem as one involving complex conjugate heat-transfer mechanisms with unknown interfacial temperatures at the glass boundaries of multiple (single, <b>double</b> and triple) <b>glazed</b> <b>units.</b> The present work focuses on 'advanced' glazing systems that have cavities containing low conductivity gases, together with low emissivity coatings on the boundary glass surfaces. Evacuation of the cavities is examined as the ideal or limiting case. The analysis suggests an order of merit for adopting new design features that place triple-glazed systems and the use of low emissivity coatings well ahead of low conductivity gases in terms of thermal performance...|$|R
30|$|Modern office {{buildings}} often have large glazed areas. Depending on the climate zone, {{incident solar radiation}} on fenestration can lead to high cooling demands during hot periods, although solar radiation can help reduce heating demands during cool periods. Previous {{studies have shown that}} {{a large proportion of the}} net energy demand of an office building is related to window heat loss and cooling demands induced by solar irradiance. Some experts [1] found that, even in what traditionally has been considered to be a heating-dominated climate, cooling demands dominate the net energy demand of an office building. Solar shading systems are vital to reduce the cooling demand of an office building and might also be necessary to reduce glare issues. In the tropics, glazed façade is also the cause of large solar heat gains inside buildings, and researchers [2] are focusing on reducing solar heat (infrared) transmittance and daylight (visible light) transmittance. It was also observed [3] that, in the case of <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> <b>units</b> (DGU), the use of a solar control film is highly recommended to increase the separation between the sheet glasses. The energy gain was reduced by 55  % compared to the traditional DGU without solar control film. Fixed shading devices (e.g. vertical fins, diagonal fins and egg crate) are used to protect inner spaces from direct solar gain through openings, windows and large glazed surfaces to control air temperature and improve the illuminance level. The results [4] showed that the temperature in offices with shading devices was reduced to an acceptable level compared to offices without shading devices. The visual environment was improved by controlling the illuminance level, improving uniformity and eliminating glare. Other researchers [5] recommend accurately estimating the optical properties of the different types of dynamic shading devices (such as roller blinds and Venetian blinds) and including their effects in the glazing system analysis. The Venetian blind is an interesting solution because it blocks direct solar radiation, whilst enabling the transmission of diffuse radiation indoors. Further progress is inextricable linked to the dynamic control of sunlight and optimal control of solar heat gains, taking into account the variability in the solar radiation spectra incident on the building’s envelope and the variability in outdoor and indoor air temperature differences. Tuning control [6] of glazing’s transmittance dependence on the solar radiation wavelength is required to optimise daylighting with reference to people’s needs (their health and comfort) and energy (thermal and electrical load minimization). However, the energy-saving potential of regulating solar spectrum response properties is greater than that of regulating the long-wave thermal emission property in summer; the trend is reversed in winter [7]. By properly regulating the NIR spectrum transmission and reflection properties and the long-wave thermal emission property, the performance of ordinary glazing can be improved to approach the perfect window for summer or winter. An advanced fenestration system must combine the functions of daylighting regulation, glare protection and seasonal thermal control.|$|R
40|$|Measurements are {{presented}} of wireless propagation into buildings via standard <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> and via heat isolating (Low Emissivity) <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> {{in the region}} 8 - 12. 5 GHz. Standard <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> attenuates the signal in line with results published elsewhere. Heat energy efficient <b>double</b> <b>glazing,</b> however, at least 20 dB more than the standard glazing of the signal does not pass. The reason for this poor propagation is outlined and a propagation model for the heat isolation window is presented...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} window {{area on the}} energy balance of a {{building}} was investigated by simulations in DEROB-LTH. The glazed area was varied in three types of buildings with different types of glazing and for several climates. One low energy house was compared to a less insulated house but identical in size and layout. Three different types of glazing were used; uncoated <b>double</b> <b>glazing,</b> <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> with one low-e coated pane and triple glazing with two low-e coated panes. Climates with variations in solar radiation, mean temperature, altitude and latitude were chosen. The results show that if energy efficient window alternatives are chosen the flexibility of choosing the glazed area and orientation is higher. Choosing a larger area facing south resulted in a higher heating demand for uncoated <b>double</b> <b>glazing</b> in the standard house. An increased area also resulted in an increased peak load for heating for all the simulated cases. Choosing the energy efficient glazing type gave a decrease in heating demand for increased south facing glazed area in the standard house. In the low energy house the difference in heating demand between different areas was smaller than for the standard house. An office module with two types of switchable glazing and one solar control <b>glazing</b> <b>unit</b> was used in three different climates; Stockholm, Brussels and Rome. Larger window areas increase the cooling demand but if glazing types with lower solar transmittance are used, the difference in cooling demand between different window areas decreases. An extremely large window area, however, increases the peak load both for cooling and for heating and should therefore be avoided. Energy can be saved by using switchable windows instead of solar control or in particular standard glazing...|$|R
40|$|The UK has {{a fairly}} mature {{building}} stock with between 1 and 5 % of new buildings being introduced each year. The {{development of new}} facade solutions which can respond {{to the needs of}} the occupants of both new and refurbished buildings is therefore a key area for development. The built environment is a major consumer of energy across the domestic, industrial and service sectors. The construction and operation of buildings are responsible for about one-third of the energy use and one-half of the electricity use in most industrialised countries. A large share of the energy use is associated with protection from the external climate and operation of systems necessary to give the occupants a comfortable indoor environment. Natural light is seen as a key driver to people’s well being both in the workplace and at a home. However, to realise high daylight factors in offices on overcast days in particular requires highly glazed facades. Single glazed windows result in high winter month heat loads, whereas modern <b>double</b> or triple <b>glazed</b> <b>units</b> could result in summer overheating without additional solar protection or ventilation. This paper discusses the issue of facade refurbishment or replacement in the UK for multi-occupancy buildings in both the commercial and domestic sectors. Sustainability is considered from people, process and product perspectives for traditionally glazed facades in comparison to double skin facades and climatic envelopes...|$|R
