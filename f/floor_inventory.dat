40|$|When {{ramping up}} {{production}} volumes, hardware startups {{are required to}} identify and tackle obstacles in multiple areas of business including finance, sales, engineering, manufacturing, and servicing. NVBOTS, a Boston based 3 D printer manufacturing startup, {{is going through a}} similar phase of production ramp-up of its printers. This thesis documents the process that the MIT M. Eng. team went through to identify such obstacles at NVBOTS. This process provides insights into what other startups in similar positions may explore. The topic of manufacturing systems was identified as a potential area of improvement as NVBOTS ramps up its production. Discrete event manufacturing simulation models are developed to evaluate two base production strategies [...] CONWIP and CONWIP-BtO hybrid. This thesis details the modeling mechanisms used to develop the simulation models. Performance trade-offs that exist for these two production strategies with respect to lead time and production <b>floor</b> <b>inventory</b> levels are analyzed. Effects of various policy levers such as CONWIP and BtO batch sizes are studied, and recommendations for these levers are made. The CONWIP policy is recommended for when lead time requirements for NVBOTS become strict. The CONWIP-Build to Order policy is not recommended given the low lead time benefit it offers compared to a pure Build to Order policy. Following feedback from NVBOTS on these two policies, an advanced Late Stage Differentiation CONWIP-BtO model is developed. This is done to evaluate the potential of late stage differentiation for when NVBOTS expands its product lines. Performance of this policy with respect to lead time and inventory levels is studied for different values of CONWIP and BtO batch sizes, number of workers and worker utilization. Potential plans of action for NVBOTS to tackle higher demands in the future are analyzed. The work described in this thesis covers roughly half of the project on manufacturing systems at NVBOTS. The other half is covered in Alexander Willem Anton van Grootel's thesis [1]. Van Grootel's thesis focuses on capacity estimation of NVBOTS' current facility and variants of the BtO policy. In contrast, this thesis analyzes CONWIP and CONWIP-BtO policies. by Yugal Raj Jain. Thesis: M.

40|$|For {{almost a}} century, the Elwha River has been {{constrained}} by the Elwha and Glines Canyon dams, which have severely restricted the transport of fine sediment downriver. The dams are currently undergoing removal; {{it is the largest}} such project ever attempted in the United States. The purposes of this experiment were to identify the macrobenthos currently living on the subaqueous delta and determine the potential impacts of dam removal, and the ensuing sediment influx, on macrobenthic diversity. Samples of benthic organisms and sediment were collected from the delta <b>floor,</b> <b>inventoried</b> and analyzed, and the results mapped to find correlations between the two. The results showed patterns suggesting a correlation between grain size and diversity, with the greatest diversity at sites with high percentages of gravel, and the lowest diversity at sites with high percentages of mud. These findings demonstrate the importance of sediment size and sorting on the diversity of the Elwha delta. Given that the sediment in Lake Aldwell and Lake Mills is expected to continue traveling downstream, this information can be used to predict how the dam removal will impact macrobenthic communities on the delta, including economically important species such as clams, geoducks and crabs. ...|$|R

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{identify}} {{factors that}} may predict success and satisfaction in women undergoing nonsurgical therapy for stress urinary incontinence. METHODS: Baseline demographic and clinical characteristics of women participating in a multicenter randomized trial of pessary, behavioral, or combined therapy for stress urinary incontinence were evaluated for potential predictors of success and satisfaction. Success and satisfaction outcomes were assessed at 3 months and included the Patient Global Impression of Improvement, stress incontinence subscale of the Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Distress <b>Inventory,</b> and Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire. Logistic regression was performed to identify predictors, adjusting for treatment and other important clinical covariates. Adjusted odds ratios (ORs), 95 % confidence intervals (CIs), and associated P values are presented. RESULTS: Four hundred forty-six women were randomized. College education or more and no previous urinary incontinence surgery predicted success based on the stress subscale of the Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Distress <b>Inventory</b> (adjusted OR 1. 61, 95 % CI 1. 01 - 2. 55, P=. 04 and adjusted OR 3. 15, 95 % CI 1. 04 - 9. 53, P=. 04, respectively). Menopausal status predicted success using the Patient Global Impression of Improvement (adjusted OR 2. 52 postmenopausal compared with premenopausal, 95 % CI 1. 29 - 4. 95; adjusted OR 1. 32 unsure menopausal status compared with premenopausal, 95 % CI 0. 65 - 2. 66; P=. 03 across all three groups). Fewer than 14 incontinence episodes per week predicted satisfaction with the Patient Satisfaction Questionnaire (adjusted OR 1. 97, 95 % CI 1. 21 - 3. 19; P=. 01). These predictors did not differ across the three treatment groups. CONCLUSION: Menopause, higher education, no previous urinary incontinence surgery, and lower incontinence frequency {{were found to be}} predictors of success and satisfaction with nonsurgical therapy for stress urinary incontinence.

40|$|Laparoscopic radical prostatectomy (LRP) {{is one of}} the {{surgical}} options for localized prostate cancer. The main goal is cancer control, but due to a migration to earlier detection and younger age of patients, there is more attention to the postoperative quality of life. One of the most well-known comorbidities of a LRP is erectile dysfunction (ED). Nerve-sparing during the surgery {{is one of the}} aspects which have influence on the postoperative ED. A total of 130 patients underwent a LRP. Before surgery and one year postoperative, the Pelvic <b>Floor</b> <b>Inventories</b> (PelFIs) is administrated. This is a validated questionnaire and during the development the International Index of Erectile Function (IIEF) was added. In addition to the PelFIs, the patients were asked to fill in the Kings Health Questionnaire (KHQ) preoperative, 6 weeks, 3 months, 6 months, 9 months and 1 year after surgery. The KHQ is a validated questionnaire concerning quality of life (QOL). During surgery the surgeon decided to perform a bilateral, unilateral or non-nerve sparring LRP. For 83 patients we received data preoperative and one year after surgery. The mean IIEF before surgery was 19. 0 and 42. 4 % of the patients already had ED. One year after surgery the mean IIEF was 7. 5 and 91. 6 % had ED. Bilateral nerve-sparring surgery is performed at 26 % of all patients. These patients scored significantly better on the IIEF postoperative than patients who underwent non-nerve sparring (P= 0. 009). Patients younger than 60 years also score significantly better compared to elder patient groups (P= 0. 004). Patients with no ED before surgery, scored postoperative also significantly higher on the IIEF than patients who already had ED before surgery (P= 0. 002). The first three months after surgery, patients scored worse on the QOL (P= 0. 001 and P= 0. 028).

40|$|Background/Aim. Pelvic floor {{dysfunction}} is {{a frequent}} problem affecting more than 50 % of women in peri- and postmenopause. Considering that ageing and menopause befall in the significant factors causing this issue, {{as well as the}} expected longevity of women in the world and in our country, pelvic floor dysfunction prevelence is foreseen to be even higher. The aim {{of the study was to}} evaluate impact of the symptoms of pelvic dysfunction on quality of life and examine body image satisfaction in adult women with pelvic organ prolapse presenting to tertiary care clinic for surgical treatment. Methods. This prospective case-control study included 50 patients who presented to tertiary care gynecology clinic for surgical treatment and 50 controls with normal pelvic floor support and without urinary incontinence who presented tertiary care gynecology clinic for other reasons. Both, patients and controls, completed two quastionnaires recommended for the evaluation of symptoms (Pelvic <b>floor</b> distress <b>inventory</b> - short forms) and quality of life impact (Pelvic floor impact questionnaire - short form) of pelvic organ prolapse, and Body Image Scale. Results. The patients scored significantly worse on the prolapse, urinary, colorectal scales and overall score of Pelvic <b>floor</b> distress <b>inventory</b> - 20 than controls subjects (134. 91 vs 78. 08; p < 0. 01). The patients also measured significant decrease in condition- specific quality of life (89. 23 vs 3. 1; p < 0. 01). They were more likely to feel self-conscious (78 % vs 42 %; p < 0. 01), less likely to feel physically attractive (78 % vs 22 %; p < 0. 01), more likely to have difficulty looking at themselves naked (70 % vs 42 %; p < 0. 01), less likely to feel sexually attractive (64 % vs 32 %; p < 0. 01), and less likely to feel feminine (56 % vs 16 %; p < 0. 05), than controls.

This retrospective, long-term follow-up (28. 17 ± 20. 7 months) comprised 113 women who underwent surgical reconstructive surgery with vaginal polypropylene mesh in a high parity rate population medical center. The women were divided into 2 groups (multiparous and grand multiparous) and each group was evaluated for objective and subjective surgical outcome. Patient demographics and surgical data were retrieved from electronic medical records. Outcome measure included POP-Q exam as objective outcome and validated Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Distress <b>Inventory</b> questionnaire (PFDI) to assess subjective outcome. Average age of patients was 62 ± 7. 9 (range 42 - 83) years. Average parity was 5. 6 ± 3. 1 (range 1 - 14). There were 54 (47. 7 %) multiparous women and 59 (52. 3 %) grand multiparous women. The grand multiparous women were younger than the multiparous women and had a significantly higher degree of prolapse.

Methods: This was a case-control study of 202 women who were recruited in an infertility clinic in Hormozgan, Iran: PCOS (n= 103) and control groups who were healthy women whose husbands were diagnosed with male infertility (n= 99). According to {{the presence or absence}} of menstrual dysfunction (M), hyperandrogenism (HA) and polycystic ovaries on ultrasonoghraphy (PCO), patients with PCOS were divided into three phenotypes: HA+PCO, M+PCO and M+HA+PCO. PFMD was assessed by the Pelvic Floor Distress Inventory- 20 (PFDI- 20. Results: The reported PFMD symptoms were higher in PCOS (P= 0. 05) than the non-PCOS group. The mean PFDI score in the HA+M+PCO was higher compared to other phenotypes, although the difference did not reach significance level (P> 0. 05). The mean LH level was higher in HA+M+PCO than the two other phenotypes. There was a significant positive correlation between LH level and PFDI score (P< 0. 04). Conclusion: The findings suggest that a high level of LH may cause PFMD. Further studies are needed to determine the precise role of LH levels and potential treatment options in women with PCOS and PFMD.

40|$|Abstract Background Pelvic organ {{prolapse}} (POP) is {{a silent}} disorder {{with a huge}} impact on women's quality of life. There is limited data from community-based studies conducted to determine the prevalence of POP as its assessment needs a pelvic examination. We aimed to develop a simple screening inventory for identification of pelvic organ prolapse and then evaluate its sensitivity and specificity. Methods This study had two phases. In the first phase in order to develop a simple inventory for assessment of POP, the Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Disorder <b>Inventory</b> (PFDI) was completed for a convenience sample of 200 women, aged 18 - 45 years, referred for annual gynecologic examination, and their pelvic organ prolapse was assessed using the standard protocol. The most sensitive and specific questions were selected as pelvic organ prolapse simple screening inventory (POPSSI). In the second phase, using a stratified multistage probability cluster sampling method, the sensitivity and specificity of the POPSSI was investigated in a non selected sample of 954 women recruited from among reproductive aged women living in four randomly selected provinces of Iran. Results The sensitivity and specificity of POPSSI for identification of pelvic organ prolapse in the general population were 45. 5 and 87. 4 % respectively; these values were 96. 7 and 20 % among those women who were aware of their pelvic dysfunction. Conclusion Community based screening studies on pelvic organ prolapse could be facilitated by using the POPSSI, the sensitivity of which would be enhanced through conducting of public awareness programs. </p...|$|R
40|$|BackgroundThere is no {{consensus}} {{on the relationship between}} depressive symptoms (DS) and pelvic organ prolapse (POP) symptoms and quality of life (QoL). Our hypothesis was that women with DS and POP have worse symptoms and QoL than those without DS and POP. AimOur aim was to compare two groups of POP patients, those with depressive symptoms and those without, and evaluate the association of symptoms and QoL. Materials and methodsThis planned report is part of a prospective study evaluating the impact of pessary use among symptomatic POP patients. Patients were evaluated by POP quantification (POP-Q), pelvic ultrasound (US), voiding diaries, stress test, pad test, Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Distress <b>Inventory</b> (PFDI- 20), Prolapse QoL (P-QoL) and the Goldberg Health Questionnaire (GHQ- 12) (psychological health screening for DS when score 5). A sample size of 78 patients was required to demonstrate a 50 -point difference in the global PFDI- 20 score with 80 % power and 95 % probability. ResultsNinety-one women with POP were included. GHQ- 12 was positive in 47 (51. 6 %) patients. No differences were found in POP-Q, pad and stress test between those with a positive GHQ- 12 and those without. However, GHQ- 12 was associated with higher PFDI- 20 scores and higher scores in seven of nine P-QoL domains. GHQ- 12 persisted as an independent risk factor for worse P-QoL scores after multivariable analysis. ConclusionA positive' screening for DS was associated with worse PFDI- 20 and P-QoL scores despite no difference in objective measurements. It may be that depressed patients interpret their symptoms differently...|$|R
40|$|To compare {{perioperative}} {{morbidity and}} 1 -year outcomes of {{older and younger}} women undergoing surgery for pelvic organ prolapse (POP). DESIGN : Prospective ancillary analysis. SETTING : Academic medical centers in National Institutes of Health, National Institute of Child Health and Human Development Colpopexy and Urinary Reduction Study. PARTICIPANTS : Women with POP and no symptoms of stress incontinence. INTERVENTION : Abdominal sacrocolpopexy with randomization to receive Burch colposuspension for treatment of possible occult incontinence or not. MEASUREMENTS : Perioperative complications and Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification and quality-of-life (QOL) questionnaires (Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Distress <b>Inventory,</b> Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Impact Questionnaire, and Medical Outcomes Study Short-Form Health Survey (SF- 36) preoperatively, immediately postoperatively, and 6 weeks and 3 and 12 months postoperatively). RESULTS : Three hundred twenty-two women aged 31 to 82 (21 % aged ≥ 70), 93 % white. Older women had higher baseline comorbidity (P <. 001) and more severe POP (P=. 003). Controlling for prolapse stage and whether Burch was performed, there were no age differences in complication rates. Older women had longer hospital stays (3. 1 ± 1. 0 vs 2. 7 ± 1. 5 days, P=. 02) and higher prevalence of incontinence at 6 weeks (54. 7 % vs 37. 2 %, P=. 005). At 3 and 12 months, {{there were no differences}} in self-reported incontinence, stress testing for incontinence, or prolapse stage. Improvements from baseline were significant on all QOL measures but with no age differences. CONCLUSION : Outcomes of prolapse surgery were comparable between older and younger women except that older women had slightly longer hospital stays...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} was to assess safety and clinical outcomes in women operated on using the Uphold (TM) Lite Vaginal Support System. We carried out a 1 -year, multicenter, prospective, single cohort study of 207 women with symptomatic Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) stage aeyen 2 apical pelvic organ prolapse, with or without concomitant anterior vaginal wall prolapse. Safety data were collected using a standardized questionnaire. Anatomical outcome was assessed by the POP-Q and subjective outcomes by the Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Distress <b>Inventory</b> after 2 months and 1 year using a one-way repeated measures analysis of variance. Pain was evaluated using a visual analog scale. The overall rate of serious complications was 4. 3 % (9 out of 207 patients), including 3 patients with bladder perforations, 1 with bleeding > 1, 000 ml, 2 who had undergone re-operations with complete mesh removal because of pain, and 3 surgical interventions during follow-up because of mesh exposure. POP-Q stage aecurrency sign 1 after 1 year was 94 % and subjective symptom relief was reported by 91 % of patients (p < 0. 001). Pain after 2 months and 1 year was 60 % lower compared with the preoperative mean (p < 0. 001). Minor complications occurred in 20 women (9. 7 %) and were dominated by lower urinary tract dysfunction. No predisposing risk factors for complications were found. The Uphold (TM) Lite procedure in women with apical pelvic organ prolapse provided satisfactory restoration of vaginal topography and symptom relief. However, serious complication rates were largely comparable {{with those of other}} transvaginal mesh kits...|$|R
40|$|A Rather Unknown Natural Heritage : The Cloudforest (Subtropical Montane Forest). "Tierra Viva", an Ecuadorian {{ecologist}} association {{have developed}} the "Bosques Nativos" Project since 1989, the purpose of which is : 1) to identify and to inventory andean native forests in Southern Ecuador; 2) to experiment methods for a sustainable and balanced forest management, e. g., agroforestry, silvo-pastoral systems; 3) to develop a consulting and educational activity about nature conservancy. What characterizes the Andean environment is that the ecological factors mainly depend on an obvious altitudinal gradient. The ubication of this region within the intertropical zone allows a development of very diverse forms of life, up to very high altitudes (above 5000 m). The cloudforests stretch between 1000 and 3000 m. Its development and its physionomy are produced by a very strong and constant humidity, {{which is due to}} the acumulation of clouds against the colossal barrier of the Andes. These clouds corne from the huge Amazon basin in the East, or from the Pacific Ocean in the West. From 1989 to 1991, the "Bosques Nativos" Project carried out inventories in three areas in Southern Ecuador. The inventories were made on 1 ha - sample parcels, dispersed throughout the studies areas, so that each valley or subvalley would be represented, as well as each altitudinal <b>floor.</b> These <b>inventories</b> mainly have forestal orientation : they only involve the adult trees, the diameter of which is superior to 10 centimeter at 1. 50 meter from the ground. Besides species identifying, several qualitative and quantitative data are consideree, {{to be able to get}} interpretation about floristic diversity and structural complexity. All this information should be the base of developing criteria for protection and type of forest management which is needed in these wide areas...|$|R
40|$|Objectives: The primary {{objective}} was to evaluate the ability of different anatomic cut-off points, as established in specialist urogynecology populations, to identify clinically relevant prolapse in a population of postmenopausal women with pelvic floor symptoms recruited from primary care. Study design: Cross-sectional study among 890 women (>= 55 years) screened for pelvic floor symptoms. Main outcome measures: The Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Distress <b>Inventory</b> 20 {{was used to measure}} symptoms, and the Pelvic Organ Prolapse Quantification (POP-Q) system was used to assess prolapse. Areas under the curves, sensitivity, and specificity were calculated for the hymen as a cut-off point for symptomatic prolapse of the anterior and posterior vaginal wall. For the apical compartment, a cut-off point of - 5 cm relative to the hymen was used. Results: Vaginal bulging was the only symptom reported more often with increasing POP-Q stages. Areas under the curves (95 % confidence intervals) to discriminate between women with and without vaginal bulging symptoms were 0. 66 (0. 61 - 0. 72), 0. 56 (0. 50 - 0. 63), and 0. 61 (0. 55 - 0. 66) for the anterior (Ba), posterior (Bp) and apical (C) compartment, respectively. When the hymen was used as the cut-off point, Ba had a sensitivity of 38. 1 % and a specificity of 82. 4 %, and Bp had a sensitivity of 13. 3 % and a specificity of 96. 5 %. For C, the cut-off point of - 5 cm relative to the hymen had a sensitivity of 37. 9 % and a specificity of 73. 1 %. Conclusions: The anatomic cut-off points for clinically relevant prolapse established in the specialist urogynecology population cannot adequately identify symptomatic prolapse in a population of postmenopausal women with pelvic floor symptoms recruited from primary care.

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{determine}} whether vaginal descent changes {{are associated with}} pelvic floor symptoms in postmenopausal women. METHODS: This 4 -year prospective study included 260 postmenopausal women with an intact uterus enrolled at one Women 2 ̆ 7 s Health Initiative (WHI) clinical trial site. All completed at least two annual pelvic organ prolapse quantification (POP-Q) examinations and symptom questionnaires (30 bladder, bowel, and prolapse symptom items, modified from the Pelvic <b>Floor</b> Distress <b>Inventory).</b> Symptoms were grouped, and group scores categorized into two or three evenly distributed levels. Year 4 data collection was incomplete because the overall WHI study halted. Generalized logistic linear models and generalized estimating equation methods were used to measure associations between vaginal descent and a symptom or symptom score, controlling for time, age, and body mass index (BMI). RESULTS: Mean age was 68 +/- 5 years, BMI 30 +/- 6 kg/m(2), and median parity 4. Ninety-five percent of women had POP-Q stages I-II prolapse. Increasing maximal vaginal descent was associated with 2 ̆ 2 see/feel a bulge 2 ̆ 2 and 2 ̆ 2 sensation of protrusion or bulging, 2 ̆ 2 and with obstructive bladder, prolapse, and obstructive bowel scores. Increasing apical descent (POP-Q point C) was associated with 2 ̆ 2 see/feel a bulge, 2 ̆ 2 increasing anterior descent (POP-Q point Ba) with bladder pain and obstructive bladder scores, and increasing posterior descent (POP-Q point Bp) with the bowel incontinence score. CONCLUSION: Although previous work showed that most pelvic floor symptoms correlated poorly with levels of early prolapse, longitudinal analysis suggests that vaginal descent progression over time is positively associated with various bladder, bowel, and prolapse symptoms in postmenopausal women with stages I-II prolapse.
