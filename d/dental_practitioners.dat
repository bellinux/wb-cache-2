Oncology patients have additional requirements for their outpatient care in the dental office.

This paper provides an overview {{of the role of the}} <b>dental</b> <b>practitioner</b> in the pre-treatment workup and post-treatment maintenance of oncology patients, and discusses the complications which occur during the intensive and in-hospital phases of care, in the context of approaches that show promise for reducing or preventing these.

40|$|At {{the moment}} {{there are no}} clear {{protocols}} {{for the assessment of}} bad breath. An organoleptic evaluation is still the reference. To date there are several tools available to detect and quantify specific compounds related to halitosis. This paper reviews the available information on three sulphur monitors (OralChroma™ (CHM- 1), Halimeter® and Breathtron®), in order to suggest guidance for the general <b>dental</b> <b>practitioner.</b> All three devices showed an acceptable correlation with organoleptic scores. The Halimeter® and Breathtron® seem the most appropriate devices for a general <b>dental</b> <b>practitioner,</b> because they are easy to handle. Because of its capacity of distinguishing between different sulphur compounds and due to its time-consuming and complicated use, the OralChroma™ (CHM- 1) seems more suitable in a research environment. status: publishe...|$|R
