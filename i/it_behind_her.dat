500|$|Although Northrup did {{not speak}} out {{publicly}} against her ex-husband following their divorce, she broke her silence in 1972. She wrote privately to Paulette Cooper, {{the author of the}} book The Scandal of Scientology who was subsequently targeted by the Church's Operation Freakout. Northrup told Cooper that Hubbard was a dangerous lunatic, and that although her own life had been transformed when she left him, she was still afraid both of him and of his followers, whom she later described as looking [...] "like Mormons, but with bad complexions." [...] In July 1986 she was interviewed by the ex-Scientologist Bent Corydon several months after Hubbard's death, which had reduced her fear of retaliation. Excerpts from the interview were published in Corydon's 1987 book, [...] She died of breast cancer in 1997 but in the last few months of her life she dictated a tape-recorded account of her relationship with Hubbard. It is now in the Stephen A. Kent Collection on Alternative Religions at the University of Alberta. Rejecting any suggestion that she was some kind of [...] "pathetic person who has suffered through the years because of my time with Ron", Northrup spoke of her relief that she had been able to put <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b> She stated that she was [...] "not interested in revenge; I'm interested in the truth" ...|$|E
500|$|Matthew Rolston {{directed}} the music video for [...] "The Climb", which premiered on Cyrus's Myspace page on February 11, 2009. The video commences {{with a shot}} of Cyrus holding a guitar and a suitcase as she begins to walk down a long path extending through a valley. At {{the end of the}} valley, the sun breaks out over a distant mountain. The entire scene is enhanced with computer-generated imagery. Cyrus has her hair tied in a bun and wears a traveling jacket, a gray tank top and cowboy boots. In a separate setting, Cyrus, wearing a gray short sleeve shirt and her hair loose, begins to sing [...] "The Climb" [...] beneath a blue spotlight in a purple room. The two settings alternate throughout the video. A vignetted scene from Hannah Montana: The Movie appears in front of Cyrus as she walks on the path. The video zooms into the scene and a montage of film clips plays, featuring Cyrus's character and her love interest, Travis Brody (played by Lucas Till) horseback riding. The video returns to Cyrus walking; she picks up a rose fallen on the path, then throws <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b> As the video progresses, she also sees things such as a herd of horses and a shooting star cross her path. A new setting enters the video in which Cyrus dances in a purple room with a countdown or, occasionally, film clips projected on the wall behind her. Rain begins to pour in the path setting. Cyrus puts down her jacket, guitar case, suitcase and boots, and continues onwards with only her guitar strapped to her shoulder. More film clip montages play {{in the same manner as}} the first. As the last montage ends, Cyrus finally reaches the summit of a reddish, CGI mountain and triumphantly looks over the cliff's edge to watch the sun shining over a shimmering lake. An alternate version of the music video excluding the Hannah Montana: The Movie clips exists and was sent to several channels, including VH1.|$|E

60|$|She {{passed in}} through the dingy door. <b>It</b> closed <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> and Wally stood for some moments staring at it with a gloomy repulsion. He thought {{he had never seen}} a dingier door.|$|R
60|$|Still {{surrounded}} by bewilderment, she wished the stranger good-night, hoping that when next they met {{she would be}} more herself. The stranger, hoping so also, {{opened the door and}} closed <b>it</b> again <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R

60|$|Still singing, he took Dan's {{hand and}} wheeled him round to face Una {{as she came}} out of the gate. <b>It</b> shut <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> {{at the same time as}} Puck threw the memory-magicking Oak, Ash and Thorn leaves over their heads.|$|R
60|$|At {{that moment}} {{she heard a}} sound in the court, as of some one approaching, and to avoid letting others know of this {{fascinating}} secret the girl thoughtlessly grasped the adobe door {{with her free hand}} and swung <b>it</b> shut <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
60|$|Louise {{glanced at}} the door that communicated with Beth's room. It stood open, but Eliza had not noticed that, as <b>it</b> was <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b> Just now a shadow cast {{from the other room}} wavered an instant over the rug, and Louise's quick eyes caught it.|$|R
60|$|Jane's {{only answer}} to this remark was {{to pass through the}} door and slam <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b> Clearly the {{prospect}} of the advent of this guest was not agreeable to her.|$|E
6000|$|Willems {{made for}} the revolver. Aissa passed swiftly, giving him an {{unexpected}} push that sent him staggering away from the tree. She caught up the weapon, put <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> back, and cried-- ...|$|E

60|$|A hastening car swept shameful past, I saw her {{hid in the}} shadow, I saw her step to the curb, {{and fast}} Run to the silent door, where last I had stood with my hand uplifted.

60|$|The {{whispering}} of {{the rain}} about them sank and died, and the sunlight struck vividly across the distant woods beyond Immering. Just then they had fallen on a silence again that was full of daring thoughts for Mr. Lewisham. He moved his arm suddenly and placed it so that <b>it</b> was <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> on {{the frame of the}} harrow.|$|R
60|$|She felt {{it would}} be a step towards defeat if she did so, but he brought up the chair in which she had before been sitting and placed <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her,</b> and quietly {{assisted}} her into it.|$|E
60|$|He {{pushed her}} {{on to the}} entrance, and held her firmly in his grasp while he lifted the latch of the door. Then {{he opened the door}} a little way, thrust her out, and slammed <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E

60|$|She strode without {{hesitation}} to the instrument, explored its ribs {{with a firm}} finger, pushed something, and the orchestrion broke off {{in the middle of}} a bar. Then, walking serenely to the door, she passed out and closed <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Mrs. Brook had {{recovered}} the volume from Mr. Longdon's relaxed hand and now, without another glance at it, held <b>it</b> <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> {{with an unusual}} air of firmness. [...] "Oh {{how can you say}} that, my dear man, of anything so revolting?" ...|$|E

60|$|Softly she stirred {{from the}} chair where she had sat before the piano, {{and opened the door}} of the outer office. A clock in a steeple near by was {{striking}} twelve.

Then <b>it</b> closed <b>behind</b> <b>her.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "Not {{as women}} are--except {{now and then}} some fool like Alford."

50|$|Mrs. Ozolins, {{an elderly}} widow from Latvia in her seventies {{decided to sell}} {{three of the four}} {{sections}} that were <b>behind</b> <b>her</b> house in Albert Street in Palmerston North.

This fourth section was separated from the three other sections by a six foot high fence. The other three sections formed a bare paddock.|$|R
