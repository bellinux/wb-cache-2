40|$|Since {{its first}} {{measurement}} in 1679, {{the usefulness of}} the location of whole body centre of mass (COM) data has progressed from having largely theoretical value into being an instrument with several diagnostic and applied scientific uses. This thesis describes first the biomechanical and measurement theory foundation of COM research and then details the historical development of methods to measure COM location and the various applied uses of this variable. Original research data presented in this thesis then go on to provide the first direct measurements of COM movement in walking humans. A second study quantifies the accuracy of the most commonly used current technique to quantify COM location (the kinematic segmental method) by determining the limits of agreement between it and a direct measurement method (the reaction-board), in lying and running subjects. In the latter studies a novel reaction-board measurement method is developed making use of life-sized projections of subjects in various stride positions and used to place runners into recumbent static running positions. These data demonstrate that reaction-board and segmental methods report COM locations with a mean difference of 1. 6 cm and agree to within limits of 6. 0 cm for the location of COM in recumbent individuals. The final study described in this thesis compares single COM measurements made using two kinematic segmental methods (models) to a <b>direct</b> <b>suspension</b> technique of measuring COM location. The suspension technique used is adapted from the original method of determining COM location upon which kinematic segmental methods derive their origin. The data show that both cadaver-derived kinematic models of COM, and kinematic models derived from live human data, differ from a direct COM suspension method, and that cadaver based estimates display greater accuracy (agreement with the <b>direct</b> <b>suspension</b> method). This study also uniquely provides information on the effect of whole body mass, body fat or body water on the accuracy of segmental models in male subjects...|$|E

40|$|Wind erosion {{modeling}} efforts, both {{field and}} wind tunnel studies, have traditionally focused on saltation-based processes for estimating dust emissions from high wind events. This approach gives generally good results when saltation-sized particles, 90 μm to 2 mm mean diameter, are prevalent on the exposed soil surface. The Columbia Plateau, located in north-central Oregon and south-central Washington, is a region with extensive loess deposits where up to 90 % of sieved particles (by mass) {{are less than}} 100 μm mean diameter. During high wind events, large amounts of soil and fine particulate matter are suspended.

40|$|Present {{methods of}} {{antimicrobial}} susceptibility testing of Bordetella pertussis are time consuming and require specialized media that are not commercially available. We tested 52 isolates of B. pertussis for resistance to erythromycin, trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole, chloramphenicol, and rifampin by agar dilution with Bordet-Gengou agar (BGA) containing 20 % horse blood (reference method), Etest using BGA and Regan-Lowe agar without cephalexin (RL−C), and disk diffusion using BGA and RL−C. The organisms tested included four erythromycin-resistant isolates of B. pertussis from a single patient, a second erythromycin-resistant strain of B. pertussis from an unrelated patient in another state, and 47 nasopharyngeal surveillance isolates of B. pertussis from children in the western United States. The results of agar dilution testing using direct inoculation of the organisms suspended in Mueller-Hinton broth were within ± 1 dilution of those obtained after overnight passage of the inoculum in Stainer-Scholte medium, which is the traditional method of testing B. pertussis. The Etest method produced MICs {{similar to those of}} the agar dilution reference method for three of the four antimicrobial agents tested; the trimethoprim-sulfamethoxazole results were lower with Etest, particularly when the <b>direct</b> <b>suspension</b> method was used. Most of the Etest MICs, except for that of erythromycin, were on scale. Disk diffusion testing using RL−C medium was helpful in identifying the erythromycin-resistant strains, which produced no zone of inhibition around the disk; susceptible isolates produced zones of at least 42 mm. Thus, the {{antimicrobial susceptibility testing}} of B. pertussis can be simplified by using the Etest or disk diffusion on RL−C to screen for erythromycin-resistant isolates of B. pertussis...|$|E
40|$|In moving {{pyroclastic}} systems, {{particles are}} sorted {{as a function}} of their sizes, densities and shapes. The analysis of the distribution of these characteristics in particle populations of pyroclastic deposits is a major tool in evaluating properties and regimes of parent transport systems. This paper reports a study of size-density relationships of component subpopulations from selected Quaternary pyroclastic deposits of the Latera Volcanic Complex (Vulsini, Italy), by means of integrated field and laboratory investigations, including grain-size and component analyses, density measurements and SEM crystal morphoscopy. Three kinds of particle size-density relationships characterize the studied deposits, as follows: (1) a significant correlation of decreasing sizes with increasing component densities exists for <b>direct</b> <b>suspension</b> sedimentation products, including Plinian fall and pyroclastic surge deposits; (2) a wide data dispersion with poor correlation normally occurs for the main zones of deposits from (high-concentration) pyroclastic flows; and (3) component subpopulations occur in a narrow size range irrespective of density in granular systems dominated by grain collisions, such as traction zones beneath (low-concentration) pyroclastic surges and sheared basal layers of pyroclastic flows. The regression coefficients of size-density relationships appear as a comparative measure of particle concentration in the parent systems, consistent with that inferred from the degree of sorting and abrasion of crystal subpopulations from sequential fragmentation/transport analysis of grain-size data, and quantitative morphoscopy. The crystal component becomes less sorted and more abraded as the fit to the size-density relationship decreases from Plinian fall to pyroclastic surge to pyroclastic flow, consistent with increasing particle concentration in the transporting current...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} ground-hugging, gas-pyroclast {{currents}} from explosive volcanic eruptions and their deposits. Key field observations and laboratory determinations are proposed to relate specific deposit types with flow regimes and particle {{concentration in the}} transport and depositional systems. Three relevant flow scenarios and corresponding deposit types have been recognized from a survey of pyroclastic successions of the Vulsini Volcanic District (central Italy) : (1) dilute, turbulent, pyroclastic currents producing normally or multiply graded beds by <b>direct</b> <b>suspension</b> sedimentation; (2) concentrated bedload regions beneath suspension currents, depositing inversely graded beds by traction carpet sedimentation; (3) self-sustained, high particle concentration, laminar, mass flows developing massive, poorly sorted bodies, with opposite grading of coarse lithic and pumice clasts, overlying fine-grained, inversely graded, basal layers. Main distinguishing criteria include the occurrence and pattern of clast grading, clast-thickness relationships, grain size, ash matrix componentry and pyroclast size-density relationships. Downcurrent and temporal transitions among identified flow scenarios are likely to occur for changing energy conditions and gas-pyroclast ratio both on regional and local scales. The nature and efficiency of magma fragmentation, volatile content, conduit geometry (which determine {{the characteristics of the}} erupted mixture and possible lateral blast component at the vent), and the angle of incidence of the column collapse, are suggested as the main factors controlling the generation of one type over the other at flow inception. Dilute, fine-grained, overpressured eruption clouds are thought to favor the formation of low particle concentration turbulent currents. Column collapse over slightly inclined volcano slopes, causing a high degree of compression of the collapsing mixture and of gas expulsion, would favor the generation of high particle concentration pyroclastic currents.

Absorption and elution experiments in two patients showed that his was probably not due to the presence of a combination of anti-Zwa and anti-Zwb antibodies.

40|$|The northern, James Ross Island {{region of}} the Larsen Basin, on the eastern, back-arc margin of the Antarctic Peninsula magmatic arc, {{includes}} one of the thickest and most complete Upper Cretaceous sedimentary successions exposed in the Southern Hemisphere. However, {{the southern part of}} the basin remains poorly known, mainly owing to inaccessibility and lack of exposure. Table Nunatak, an isolated, 1 -km-long, 400 -m-wide outcrop at the tip of Kenyon Peninsula, is the only known exposure of Upper Cretaceous or younger strata in this region. The 62 -m-thick succession exposed there is assigned to the newly defined Table Nunatak Formation. It consists mainly of sharp-based, amalgamated beds of fine-grained sandstone up to 2. 8 m thick, with subordinate intervals of intensely bioturbated mudstone. Wave ripples are present at some levels, and locally developed swaley cross-stratification provides evidence for storm-generated combined-flow deposition. However, most sandstone beds appear to be internally structureless apart from normal grading, and are interpreted as the <b>direct</b> <b>suspension</b> deposits of highly sediment-charged storm- and/or flood-related flows. The succession represents relatively nearshore deposition, probably at the mouth of a river or deltaic distributary channel. Charcoalified plant debris, abundant at the tops of some sandstone beds, suggests a periodically wildfire-swept hinterland forested largely by coniferous trees. Dinoflagellate cyst assemblages indicate a late Santonian age, and suggest correlation with the basal part of the Lachman Crags Member of the Santa Marta Formation (Marambio Group) on James Ross Island. Palaeocurrents, sandstone petrography and the high sediment supply rate proposed for the Table Nunatak Formation, suggest a relatively high-relief source area to the west, with large-scale erosion of granitoid plutons and metamorphic rocks, possibly related to arc uplift during a mid-Cretaceous compressional episode. The formation is evidence of a major southward extension of the Upper Cretaceous strata exposed in the northern Larsen Basin, and suggests lateral continuity of shallow-marine deposition for at least 500 – 600 km along the Weddell Sea margin of the Antarctic Peninsula in Santonian times...|$|E
40|$|The {{ever-increasing}} {{requirements in}} drive dynamics, comfort and efficiency are challenges that {{the automotive industry}} faces when designing new vehicles. Development of advanced suspension systems and drive dynamics control systems are opportunities to meet these challenges. This thesis examines the optimal control problem of a new active suspension system that is being developed at Daimler AG. Several different control structures are tested {{with the goal of}} finding the one that has the best comfort and energy-efficiency qualities. The thesis is divided into two main topics. The first one discusses suspension systems and introduces a new active suspension actuator that is being developed at Daimler. The actuator is modeled, linearized and combined with a quarter-car model to create a complete system model. In the second main section optimal and robust control is discussed with a focus on the H-infinity-method. This method aims to find the controller that stabilizes the system and minimizes the worst-case gain from disturbance inputs to system outputs. Six different controllers are designed, discretized and tested by applying them to a detailed nonlinear model of the system. Three of the configurations control the system in a cascaded manner and the rest control the system directly based on the vehicle body acceleration and road level signals. An advanced nonlinear two-degree-of-freedom (2 DOF) controller serves as a benchmark system that helps to assess the performance of the new controllers. The study indicates that all six controllers are able to stabilize the system and increase comfort. Comfort performance was assessed with power spectral density (PSD) graphs of vehicle body acceleration data that was measured during test track simulations. The best cascaded control structure has a near identical performance with the 2 DOF controller while the best <b>direct</b> <b>suspension</b> controller is able to improve comfort on low frequencies even more than the other systems without increasing the power consumption. Additionally, utilizing preview measurements of the road level further increases the bandwidth of the controller. Implementing the controllers on a testbed would be the next step of the project but it is outside the scope of this work. Future work also includes studying and improving the robustness properties of the controller by using parameter variation during control design...|$|E

The results were compared to the population analysis profile-area under the curve ratio method (PAP-AUC ratio {{compared to that of}} Mu 3) as described by Wootton et al. The agar screening method using brain heart infusion agar (6 μg of vancomycin per ml) gave a sensitivity of 22 % and a specificity of 97 %. A similar method using Mueller-Hinton agar (5 μg of vancomycin per ml) gave a sensitivity of 20 % and a specificity of 99 %. The PS method detected 34 false positives (12 %) and gave a sensitivity of 71 % and a specificity of 88 %. Etest using 0. 5 and 2. 0 McF inocula gave sensitivities and specificities of 82 and 93 % and of 96 and 97 %, respectively. The best Etest interpretative criteria for the 2. 0 McF inoculum was ≥ 8 mg of vancomycin per liter and ≥ 8 μg teicoplanin per ml or ≥ 12 μg of teicoplanin per ml.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the <b>directed</b> sedimentation of <b>suspension</b> particles {{in a thin}} layer of liquid (≤ 1 mm) onto a featureless glass substrate by Marangoni flows. A programmable 16 _ 8 array of surface mount resistors suspended 0. 1 – 2 mm above the liquid provides dynamic millimeter-sized heat sources to locally heat the liquid surface to temperatures from approximately 28. 5 to 36. 5 °C. The heaters in this array can be activated independently by a graphical user interface, creating surface tension gradients along the liquid surface. The resulting Marangoni flows direct spatially localized particle sedimentation on the substrate. The resultant sedimentation patterns and accumulation levels depend on factors such as the temperature gradient at the liquid surface, number of active heaters and type of liquid used. For example, when a single heater is activated, a liquid surface temperature elevation of 6. 9 °C results in a localized sedimentation of suspended weed pollen Kochia scoparia (_ = 25 µm) in silicone oil DC- 704 over a region of 2. 9 mm 2 that is centered directly beneath the active heater.

To find out the side effect of application of P. fumosoroseuson black ant, Dolichoderus thoracicus, a series of observations were carried out at the Laboratory of Pest and Diseases Indonesian Coffee and Cocoa Research Institute (ICCRI) and in a cocoa plantation of Glenmore, Banyuwangi district, since June until October, 2004. Laboratory research used four concentrations of P. fumosoroseusnamely 105, 106, 107 and 108 spores/ml, while in the field used concentration 2, 4, 6, 8 g dry spores/ml. Each trial as compared with spraying of carbamate and synthetic pyrethroid insecticides as control and untreated This research was designed by randomized block design and four replications. The results showed that in the laboratory, <b>direct</b> spraying <b>suspension</b> of P. fumosoroseuskilled black ant between 20 — 39 % which infected fungi about 2. 5 — 12. 5 %. The relationship between log of spores concentration of P. fumosoroseus and probit of ant mortality followed the regression equation Y = 3. 653 + 0. 097 X with LC 50 was 8 x 10 13 spore/ml. The period needed to kill a half of ant population at the laboratory (LT 50) at concentration 107 spores/ml followed the regression equation Y = 1. 851 + 1. 522 X, with LT 50 is 12, 01 days. The effect of pyrethroid and carbamate insecticide on ants mortality were 91. 25 % and 98. 75 % respectively. In the field, the effect of P. fumosoroseusspray on black ant population was very low, with the percentage of ant mortality at cocoa leaf nest were 0. 25 – 0. 46 % and at cocoa leaf nest in plastic bag were 0. 06 – 0. 21 %, while carbamate and pyrethroid synthetic effect were 37. 35 % and 52. 37 % at cocoa leaf nest, and 19. 15 % and 46. 67 % at cocoa leaf nest in plastic bags.

Transient increase in heart rate and mean arterial pressure commonly occur during manipulation of the airway via direct laryngoscopy. This phenomenon is understood {{to be due to}} a sympathetic nervous system reflex causing an increase in plasma catecholamines. Rarely, severe bradycardia and possible asystole can occur following laryngoscopy. One previous report described asystole during suspension laryngoscopy after uneventful direct laryngoscopy. Here we report a case of asystole occurring at the time of reinsertion and cuff inflation of an endotracheal tube in a patient who had been hemodynamically stable during initial direct laryngoscopy and the ensuing suspension laryngoscopy. The asystole was immediately recognized and successful cardiopul-monary resuscitation was performed with the patient returning to baseline sinus rhythm. Cardiac arrest following laryngoscopy is rare. This case highlights the importance of continued vigilance even after the initial manipulations of the airway by both <b>direct</b> laryngoscopy and <b>suspension</b> laryngoscopy are to be performed. Identifying patients who may benefit from premedication with a vagolytic drug may prevent adversity. Preoperative heart rate analysis can identify patients with strong vagal tone. 1...|$|R
40|$|Compost teas are {{fermented}} extracts of composted {{materials that}} are used to control plant diseases. A compost extractor in liquid phase, with forced air blowing system and assembled using farmer facilities, was used to produce “on farm” aerated compost teas (CTs) from five types of compost, in a 14 -day fermentation cycle. Solid feed stocks, including one biowaste compost and four composted tomato residues, were extracted in water (waCTs) and whey (whCTs), separately. The ten teas showed high biological control ability, both in vitro and in vivo, against three tomato pathogens: Alternaria alternata, Botrytis cinerea and Pyrenochaeta lycopersici. In in vitro trials, the suppressive ability of raw CTs was lost with sterilization, suggesting an antibiotic-like antagonism effect due to active microorganisms in <b>suspension.</b> <b>Direct</b> application of teas on tomato plants significantly reduced disease symptoms caused by tested pathogens. In vivo suppressiveness was more significant using the liquid phase fermentation (whey or water) than the compost. Whey could be considered a viable extractant for suppressive compost-tea production, although further dilution in dechlorinated water at a ratio of at least 1 : 5 proved a necessary method to avoid occurrence of root or foliar phytotoxicity, probably due to high salt concentrations and sub-acid pH of the relative teas...|$|R
40|$|A dual track {{approach}} {{has been applied to}} the study of oxygen transport behavior of erythrocyte/hemoglobin mixtures flowing in microvessels. The method includes experimental and theoretical modeling of the microcirculation. An experimental in vitro 27 μm diameter capillary model was developed to provide detailed oxygen flux measurements for homeglobin solutions, erythrocyte suspensions, and erythrocyte/hemoglobin solution mixtures. The experimental apparatus includes computerized data acquisiton and control coupled to a Leitz Toolmaker Microscope-based, dual wavelength microspectrophotomer. Fractional oxygen saturation may be determined for various axial positions, and the resulting experimental data have been shown to agree well with simulations calculated from previously developed theoretical models of oxygen transport in hemoglobin solutions and rbc <b>suspensions.</b> <b>Direct</b> comparison of hemoglobin solutions with rbc suspensions of the same overall hemoglobin concentration and oxygen affinity shows that hemoglobin solutions are more efficient transporters of oxygen. Experiments on polymerized hemoglobin suggests that some heme pockets may have not be available for oxygen transport. The quality and quantity of the experimental data represent a significant improvement over previous experimental designs, and the results confirm existing oxygen transport models. Ultrapurified, native and polymerized bovine hemoglobin/red blood cell mixtures were studied in the capillary. Dose response plots were generated by varying the extracellular to intracellular hemoglobin distribution ratio. Increased extracellular hemoglobin concentration increased oxygen transport efficiency for both uptake and release. When only 10...|$|R
40|$|Cultures were {{initiated}} with peripheral leukocytes from individuals: (i) in the acute stage of infectious mononucleosis (IM); (ii) with past histories of IM; and (iii) without histories of IM and without antibodies to EB virus (EBV). In confirmation of other reports, {{the first group}} of cultures developed readily and rapidly into lines of blastoid cells. Cellular replication commenced in 24 of 25 attempts within 17 to 28 days, regardless of the technique employed; i. e., initial seeding of the leukocytes with or without addition of phytohemagglutinin onto monolayers of human diploid cells (WI- 38) or <b>direct</b> establishment of <b>suspension</b> cultures. EBV was detected in all cultures by immunofluorescence and also by electron microscopy when tested. Furthermore, the nine cultures which were examined cytogenetically revealed the C-group (# 10) chromosomal marker previously found in cultured Burkitt tumor cells. These findings supported the earlier conclusion that EBV is related to, if not identical with, the causative agent of IM. Cultures of the second group commenced growth only within 30 to 60 days in five of seven attempts, depending apparently upon the early presence of WI- 38 cells. These cultures also revealed the presence of EBV and, in the three examined, the C-group chromosomal marker. Leukocytes of the third group, seeded onto WI- 38 monolayers, failed to become established in four attempts. The possible implications of these findings are discussed...|$|R
