30|$|With {{regard to}} the BR schemes, a <b>fixed</b> <b>guard</b> channel scheme [13] is {{proposed}} to reserve {{a certain amount of}} bandwidth for upcoming handoff connections to assure seamless handoff processes. When the total bandwidth utilization of existing users reaches the threshold, no more new connections can be admitted into the network. Nevertheless, when a fixed amount of bandwidth can never be used for new connections, a certain portion of network resources may be wasted. The study [10] proposes to dynamically adjust the quantity of reserved bandwidth based on the arrival and departure behavior of handoff connections to make the resource utilization more efficient. However, if handoff connections occur infrequently, the quantity of reserved bandwidth for handoffs is almost fixed and this approach would be similar to the <b>fixed</b> <b>guard</b> channel scheme and cause a waste of network resources as well.|$|E

40|$|One of the {{prevalent}} method to achieve clock synchronization in star topology based wireless network, is by periodic transmission of a ``Beacon'' {{message from the}} controller. Using this message other nodes locate {{the start of the}} time frame established by the controller. This technique has not been energy efficient in case of low duty cycle applications, where the nodes have to receive the Beacon at the start of every frame even when they don't have any data to transmit. Few of existing works solve this problem by introducing a larger fixed size guard time between the transmission slots allocated to the devices. This allows the devices to skip multiple Beacons and still transmit in their allocated time slot without any collision. In such methods amount of bandwidth which remain unutilized due to <b>fixed</b> <b>guard</b> time becomes a considerably large fraction of the total available bandwidth. In this paper, we propose a novel technique to allow the nodes to skip the Beacon for certain number of frames by introducing the concept called Variable Guard Time (VGT). The number of frames that a node can remain synchronized with the coordinator without receiving the Beacon depends upon the number of Guard Slots allocated to it. This is decided based upon factors like the node's energy saving requirement, the actual clock drift rate between the devices and the available bandwidth. Simulation results show that, in terms of bandwidth utilization, the proposed idea of VGT outperforms the traditional approach of <b>fixed</b> <b>guard</b> time scheme...|$|E
40|$|Provisioning {{of quality}} of service (QoS) is a key issue in visible light {{communication}} (VLC) system {{as well as in}} other wireless communication systems. Due to the fact that QoS requirements are not as strict for all traffic types, more calls of higher priority traffic classes can be accommodated by blocking some more calls of lower priority traffic classes. Diverse types of high data rate traffic are supported by existing wireless communication systems while the resource is limited. Hence, priority based resource allocation can ensure the service quality for the calls of important traffic class. The <b>fixed</b> <b>guard</b> channels to prioritize any class of calls always reduce the channel utilization. In this paper we propose a priority based dynamic channel reservation scheme for higher priority calls that does not reduce the channel utilization significantly. The number of reserved channels for each of the individual traffic classes is calculated using real-time observation of the call arrival rates of all the traffic classes. The features of the scheme allow reduction of the call blocking probability of higher priority calls along with the increase of the channel utilization. The proposed Markov Chain model is expected to be very much effective for the queuing analysis especially for the priority scheme of any number of traffic classes. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme is able to attain reasonable call blocking probability of higher priority calls without sacrificing channel utilization...|$|E
40|$|Currently {{radio network}} {{resource}} is rigidly partitioned for dedicated purposes. Most {{of the spectrum}} is already allocated, but {{a large part of}} it is underutilized and the utilization varies greatly in time and space. The exclusive license of fixed size spectrum blocks separated by <b>fixed</b> <b>guard</b> bands easily solves the interference problems; however the fixed allocation of spectrum is clearly inadequate for providing optimal spectrum efficiency for spatially and temporarily varying loads. Dynamic spectrum allocation is a new and promising alternative to fixed allocation schemes. In Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) networks the assigned spectrum block may vary in time and space, too. We describe a new spectrum management model for Dynamic Spectrum Access (DSA) networks. We also propose an architecture that splits the complex problem into Temporal and Spatial Dynamic Spectrum Allocation (TDSA and SDSA). In our model Regional Spectrum Brokers (RSB) coordinate the temporal dynamic spectrum allocation for a given region within which we assume that the spatial distribution of the spectrum demand is homogeneous. To coordinate the spatial dynamic spectrum allocation between the neighboring regions, the Regional Spectrum Brokers need to communicate {{to take into account the}} overlapping regions. One solution is to deploy a centralized entity also, called Spectrum Broker Coordinator (SBC), which stores the spectrum demands of the regions, and the spectrum management at the borders of the regions is realized based on this information. A more robust and scalable solution is to build the network without the central SBC where the regional brokers communicate peer-to-peer and on demand. We propose algorithms for managing at the region-borders and brokering inside the regions and between the regions 1. ...|$|E

40|$|The {{increasing}} demand for advanced services in wireless networks raises {{the problem for}} quality of service (QoS) provisioning with proper resource management. In this research, such a provisioning technique for wireless networks is performed by Call Admission Control (CAC). A new approach in CAC named by Uniform Fractional Band (UFB) is proposed in this work for the wireless networks for providing proper priority between new calls and handover calls. This UFB scheme is basically a new style of handover priority scheme. Handover priority is provided by two stages in this scheme which help the network to utilize more resources. In addition, the handover call rate estimation {{and its impact on}} QoS provisioning is discussed widely to attain the optimum QoS in proposed handover priority scheme. In multiple services providing wireless network, excessive call blocking of lower priority traffic is very often event at very high traffic rate which is a concerning issue for QoS provisioning. To attain such QoS provisioning for multiple services, another CAC scheme is proposed in this research work. This scheme is recognized by Uniform Band Thinning (UBT) scheme which is based on uniform thinning technique (UTT) and this is quite similar idea as UFB scheme. In this scheme, a set of channels experiences the fractionizing policy. This scheme reduces the call blocking probabilities (CBP) of lower priority traffic classes without notably increasing the CBP of the higher priority traffic classes. The analytical functions of this scheme are deduced in general form which is useful to deduce for any number of traffic classes. In addition, numerical analysis of the proposed UBT scheme shows that the performances in terms of call blocking probability, overall call blocking probability, and channel utilization are improved and optimized compared to the conventional <b>fixed</b> <b>guard</b> channel scheme.
