5|$|In 1414, {{six years}} before the Treaty of Troyes, a statute of Henry V of England gave {{directions}} to the goldsmiths {{in terms of the}} troy pound. (In 1304 it had apparently not yet been introduced, since it did not appear in the statute of weights and measures.) There is evidence from the 15th century that the troy pound was used <b>for</b> <b>weighing</b> metals and spices. After the abolishment of the Tower pound in 1527 by Henry VIII of England, the troy pound was the official basis for English coin weights. The British apothecaries' system was based on the troy pound until metrication, and it survived in the United States and Australia well into the 20th century.|$|E
5|$|To unify all weight systems used by apothecaries, the Irish pharmacopœia of 1850 {{introduced}} a new variant of the apothecaries' system which subdivided a new apothecaries' pound of 12 avoirdupois ounces instead of the troy pound. To allow effective use of the new system, new weight pieces were produced. Since an avoirdupois ounce corresponds to 28.35g, the proposed system was {{very similar to that}} in use in Portugal and Spain, and in some locations in Italy. But it would have doubled the value of the avoirdupois drachm (an existing unit, but by then only used <b>for</b> <b>weighing</b> silk). Therefore, it conflicted with other non-standard variations that were based on that nearly obsolete unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{national}} French standard until 1799 {{was based}} on a famous artefact called the , which probably dates back to {{the second half of the}} 15th century. It is an elaborate set of nesting weight pieces, with a total metric weight of 12.238kg. The set is now shown in the Musée des Arts et Métiers in Paris. The total nominal value of the set is 50 marcs de Troyes or marcs de Paris, a mark being 8ounces. The ounce poids de marc had therefore a metric equivalent of 30.59g. The poids de marc was used as a national French standard for trading, for gold, silver and jewels, and <b>for</b> <b>weighing</b> medicine. It was also used in international communications between scientists. In the time before the French Revolution, the civil pound also played the role of the apothecaries' pound in the French apothecaries' system, which otherwise remained a standard system of the Romance (24 grains per scruple) type.|$|E

25|$|Following his father's death, Henry bought {{another house}} {{in town and}} also a house in Clapham Common, {{at that time to}} the south of London. The London house {{contained}} the bulk of his library, while he kept most of his instruments at Clapham Common, where he carried out most of his experiments. The most famous of those experiments, published in 1798, was to determine the density of the Earth and became known as the Cavendish experiment. The apparatus Cavendish used <b>for</b> <b>weighing</b> the Earth was a modification of the torsion balance built by Englishman and geologist John Michell, who died before he could begin the experiment. The apparatus was sent in crates to Cavendish, who completed the experiment in 1797–1798 and published the results.|$|E
25|$|Craig {{argues that}} the best {{explanation}} of these three events is that God raised Jesus from the dead. He rejects alternative theories such as Lüdemann's hallucination hypothesis as lacking explanatory scope, explanatory power, and sufficient historical knowledge to support the psychoanalysis Lüdemann performs. Craig's historical case for the resurrection employ's standard historical practices <b>for</b> <b>weighing</b> historical hypotheses concluding that the resurrection is a better match to the available historical data. Specifically, Craig argues, that if one does not begin {{with the assumption that}} there is no God, there is a higher probability of the resurrection hypothesis than of its negation, so the resurrection hypothesis is improbable only if one begins with unsupported assumptions. Craig also notes that a miraculous explanation of the evidence is increased when one locates the resurrection of Jesus in the context of Jesus' ministry and personal statements. This context, Craig argues, provides the interpretive key to the meaning of Jesus' resurrection as the divine vindication of the allegedly blasphemous statements for which Jesus was tried and executed.|$|E

25|$|Marion M. Ganey, S.J., {{was largely}} {{responsible}} for introducing cooperatives and credit unions to Belize beginning in 1943, in response to Pius XI’s social encyclical Quadragesimo anno. Within 10 years of the first credit union, the colony had 22 credit unions and the “various cooperatives embraced consumer, marketing, housing, hog, chicle, and farmers co-operatives.” The religious sisters did their part, the Pallottines in Punta Gorda in the 1940s teaching girls the canning of produce. In 1951 Jesuit Fr. William Ulrich gave the Maya of San Antonio village a scale <b>for</b> <b>weighing</b> their hogs, protecting them from sharkers who grossly underestimated the weight. From increased revenue the villagers bought a truck to carry their hogs and other produce to market, and a hog cooperative was formed. Ulrich’s action also impacted village politics. By encouraging “the election of younger and more progressive men to the Alcalde’s Council which {{had been set up}} by Fr. Knopp” this “irretrievably altered the traditional relationship between the old and the young.” The credit union movement included Jesuit Henry Sutti, the first priest to come out of Boys Town, Nebraska, and in 1943 founder of the Holy Redeemer Credit Union, which in 2009 was capitalized at Bz$322.7 million with 42,262 members. Since 1956, the Director of the Credit union has been Jane Ellen Usher.|$|E
500|$|The {{works of}} Archimedes {{were written in}} Doric Greek, the dialect of ancient Syracuse. The written work of Archimedes has not survived {{as well as that}} of Euclid, and seven of his treatises are known to have existed only through {{references}} made to them by other authors. Pappus of Alexandria mentions On Sphere-Making and another work on polyhedra, while Theon of Alexandria quotes a remark about refraction from the [...] Catoptrica. During his lifetime, Archimedes made his work known through correspondence with the mathematicians in Alexandria. The writings of Archimedes were first collected by the Byzantine Greek architect Isidore of Miletus (c. 530AD), while commentaries on the works of Archimedes written by Eutocius in the sixth century AD helped to bring his work a wider audience. Archimedes' work was translated into Arabic by Thābit ibn Qurra (836–901AD), and Latin by Gerard of Cremona (c. 1114–1187AD). During the Renaissance, the Editio Princeps (First Edition) was published in Basel in 1544 by Johann Herwagen with the works of Archimedes in Greek and Latin. Around the year 1586 Galileo Galilei invented a hydrostatic balance <b>for</b> <b>weighing</b> metals in air and water after apparently being inspired by the work of Archimedes.|$|E
500|$|Rosberg {{was again}} fastest {{in the second}} {{practice}} session on Friday evening. His time of 1:31.001 {{was more than one}} and a half seconds faster than the pole position time in the previous year's event. Lewis Hamilton finished second fastest, 0.241 seconds adrift of Rosberg. Jenson Button set the third fastest time for McLaren, although he was more than a second off the fastest time. Several drivers voiced surprise over McLaren's pace during Friday's practice sessions, described by Button as the team's best [...] "for a couple of years". Max Verstappen followed in fourth, ahead of the two Ferrari cars of Räikkönen and Vettel. The latter had set the third-fastest time on the soft tyre compound, but mistakes during his runs on the super-soft tyres meant that he was unable to place higher than sixth. He had to end his session fifteen minutes early when his rear-left wheel nut came loose. Vandoorne was eleventh fastest in his second session, while Sergio Pérez, who took back the car from Celis, was fifteenth, two places ahead of his teammate Nico Hülkenberg. Vibrations from running over the kerbs caused the front wing on Romain Grosjean's car to dislodge, forcing him off track. He was able {{to get back into the}} pitlane and had the wing replaced. At the end of the session, Renault's Kevin Magnussen failed to stop <b>for</b> <b>weighing,</b> instead returning to his garage, where work was conducted on his car. As a consequence, he was forced to start the race from the pitlane.|$|E
