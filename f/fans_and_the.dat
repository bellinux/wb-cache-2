5|$|During the 1970s and '80s (the main era for {{organised}} football-related violence), West Ham gained further notoriety for {{the levels}} of hooliganism in their fan base and antagonistic behaviour towards both their own and rival <b>fans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> police. During the '70s in particular, rival groups of West Ham fans from neighbouring areas often did battle with each other at games, most often groups from the neighbouring districts of Barking and Dagenham.|$|E

5|$|In December 1990, the NHL held {{a meeting}} in Palm Beach, Florida, to {{consider}} expansion applications. The NHL executives were reportedly impressed by the Ottawa presentation, including Finnigan's participation, the several hundred <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> marching band who traveled to Palm Beach, but apparently were more impressed {{at the fact that}} the group {{was one of the few}} applicants willing to pay the $50 million franchise fee without reservations. On December 6, 1990, the Terrace group was approved to purchase one of the two franchises (along with the Tampa Bay Lightning) to start play in the 1992–93 season.|$|E
5|$|In {{the closing}} {{stages of the}} first half, Van Nistelrooy got his first shot on goal, turning Senderos only to send the ball {{trickling}} along the floor for Lehmann to save comfortably. The first half finished with a foul on Rooney, who had done well to break free of challenges from Cole, Vieira and Senderos, who eventually brought Rooney down. The English forward took the free kick himself, but it went over the bar to cheers from the Arsenal <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> sound of the referee's half-time whistle.|$|E

5|$|By this time, Led Zeppelin {{were the}} world's number one rock attraction, having outsold most bands of the time, {{including}} the Rolling Stones. Presence, released in March 1976, marked {{a change in}} the Led Zeppelin sound towards more straightforward, guitar-based jams, departing from the acoustic ballads and intricate arrangements featured on their previous albums. Though it was a platinum seller, Presence received a mixed reaction among <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> music press, with some critics suggesting that the band's excesses may have caught up with them. Page had begun using heroin during recording sessions for the album, a habit which may have affected the band's later live shows and studio recordings, although this has been denied by Page.|$|E

5|$|It {{was these}} 1986 Giants that popularized the {{football}} tradition of dousing {{the head coach}} with a cooler of Gatorade {{near the end of}} a victorious game. This originally started in 1985 when Jim Burt, incensed by what he thought was mistreatment he received in practice the week leading up to a game, exacted revenge on Bill Parcells by dumping a cooler of Gatorade on him after the Giants won that week's game. Lawrence Taylor and Harry Carson later picked up on the ploy and would often sneak up on Coach Parcells near the end of games to dump the remaining Gatorade over his head. The dousing was a big hit with <b>fans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Gatorade dumping would continue on throughout the season after each win, with Taylor, Carson, and several other players (Burt had since ceased doing it) concocting increasingly elaborate, sneaky and playful ruses, so as to at least attempt to keep the inevitable dousing a surprise.|$|E
5|$|On 7 July 2011 Fowler {{agreed to}} play with Muangthong United, signing a one-year contract. In a press conference he stated that the weather {{conditions}} of Nonthaburi {{should not be a}} problem as he had played in Townsville and Perth. He was quickly a hit with Muangthong <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Thai public in general; he attended Thailand's World Cup Qualifier against Oman wearing the national team's shirt. He has since played a handful of scoreless games, both at the Yamaha Stadium and on the road in the AFC Cup, until the Twin Qilins were eliminated from the competition by Al-Kuwait. After the sacking of Henrique Calisto as head coach, Fowler was made player/coach.|$|E
5|$|The All-Americans had the Akron Pros {{as their}} next opponent. The All-Americans were tired from their {{victory against the}} Canton Bulldogs the day before. Before {{the start of the}} game, Bob Nash of Akron was sold to the All-Americans for $300 and 5% of the Akron-Buffalo gate, making the first deal in APFA history. The reason for the trade was because rain caused a low amount of <b>fans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> game would not have been {{profitable}} for the Pros. However, Nash did not appear in the game for either team, and Scotty Bierce replaced Nash for the Pros. The rain caused sloppy game play as well as a small crowd of 3,000 people. The All-Americans had an opportunity to score in the final minutes of the game. Fritz Pollard fumbled the ball, and Heinie Miller recovered it. Buffalo had the ball on the 12-yard-line, but the officials called the end of the game. It resulted in a 0–0 tie.|$|E

5|$|The {{following}} week, United traveled up the Interstate 95 {{corridor to}} take on their Atlantic Cup rivals, Red Bull New York. The Red Bulls, previously thrashed United 4–0 in April, and looked to be heavy favorites by <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> media alike, especially coming off a 5–0 home win over Toronto. During the 61st minute of play, De Rosario scored against his former club to give United a 1–0 advantage, which ended up being the match-winning goal. The win means that the Red Bulls have failed to defeat United at home since 2008. In spite of the win, United failed to win the Atlantic Cup trophy {{for the second consecutive}} year, losing 4–1 on aggregate. However, despite winning the Cup for the second straight year, Red Bulls players found the consolation prize as nothing worth meriting about. D.C. continued their streak the following week, drawing 0–0 to FC Dallas at Pizza Hut Park.|$|E
5|$|Virginia Tech's {{turnaround}} from a 281 {{season in}} 1992 {{was the largest}} single-season turnaround in school history and was the second-best {{in the country that}} year. Tech hoped to improve upon a 14 all-time record in bowl games, while Indiana hoped to do likewise for its 34 historical bowl-game record. In the week prior to the game, bad weather in Virginia caused travel delays that prevented many <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> Virginia Tech marching band from arriving at the game early. Two days prior to the Independence Bowl, Tech was shocked by the death of Dr. Richard Bullock, who served as the team's physician from 1971 to 1988. Bullock designed a special football neck protector worn by players during the 1980s and 1990s before being phased out in favor of more advanced padding.|$|E
5|$|With two clubs from Edinburgh {{qualifying}} for the final, some City of Edinburgh Council members {{called for the}} match to be played at Murrayfield Stadium instead of Hampden Park, the traditional venue for Scottish Cup Finals. A survey by the Edinburgh Evening News found that 37 of 58 councillors favoured Murrayfield, with nine favouring Hampden. Supporters of moving the game to Murrayfield cited its greater capacity, convenience {{for the majority of}} <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> precedent of the 1896 Scottish Cup Final. The Scottish Football Association stated that no venue other than Hampden would be considered. Supporters of keeping the game at Hampden cited that the players would prefer to play at the national football stadium and that some fans had already begun to make arrangements for the tie being in Glasgow. First ScotRail provided additional capacity on their routes between Edinburgh and Glasgow.|$|E

5|$|After his {{baseball}} career ended, Paciorek {{returned to school}} and {{earned a degree in}} physical education from the University of Houston, a degree that he began to pursue while recovering from back surgery. While acquiring his degree, he became a Christian Scientist and married Linda Cupp. After graduating from college, he spent several years as an instructor at a Jewish community center, then became a physical education teacher after inquiring about a Christian Science Monitor advertisement for a teaching position at Clairbourn School in San Gabriel, California. Linda died of breast cancer in 1987, and Paciorek married Karen Purdy two years later. Paciorek has four sons and four daughters. His nephew, Joey Paciorek, played in the Milwaukee Brewers minor league organization, and his sons, Pete and Mack, had minor league careers as well. While watching his son in training camp, Paciorek became an author after watching what he felt was improper instruction given to the players. He has since written two books, Plato & Socrates, Baseball's Wisest <b>Fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>The</b> Principle of Baseball, and All There is to Know About Hitting.|$|E
5|$|Although Taylor {{recorded}} nine {{sacks and}} made the All-Pro team {{for the third consecutive}} season in 1983, the Giants struggled. The team went 3–12–1, and Parcells received heavy criticism from <b>fans</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> media. Taylor was forced to play inside linebacker for part of the season, a position which allowed him less pass rushing opportunities, when Carson was injured. Frustrated by the losing, Taylor began acting out by arriving late for meetings, and not participating in conditioning drills in practice. After the season, Taylor was involved in a fight for his services between the Giants and the New Jersey Generals of the United States Football League. Taylor was given a $1 million interest-free, 25-year loan by Generals owner Donald Trump on December 14, 1983, with the provision that he begin playing in the USFL in 1988. Taylor regretted the decision, and less than a month later attempted to renege. His agent was able to negotiate by meeting with Trump personally and then the Giants which resulted in allowing Taylor to go with the Giants. Taylor got a 6-year $6.55-million package that also included a $1 million interest-free loan. The main results of these negotiations were threefold: 1) Taylor returned the $1 million to Trump, 2) the Giants paid Trump $750,000 over the next five seasons, and 3) the Giants gave Taylor a new six-year, $6.2-million-dollar contract.|$|E
5|$|Arsenal played league challengers Manchester United on 11 April 1999. Neither {{team was}} able to score even after extra time had been played, {{therefore}} the match was decided in a replay four days later. David Beckham opened the scoring for United from a long range shot, but Bergkamp equalised with a shot that deflected off United's centre back Jaap Stam. United captain Roy Keane was red-carded for two bookable offences, with his team playing the last thirty minutes of normal time a man down. In injury time, Phil Neville fouled Parlour in the penalty area, conceding a penalty. Peter Schmeichel parried away Bergkamp's resultant spot kick and the game went into extra time. Giggs scored partway through {{the second half of}} extra time. Picking up possession on the halfway line after a loose pass from Patrick Vieira, he dribbled past the entire Arsenal back line before shooting just under Seaman's bar. Giggs ran celebrating towards the United <b>fans,</b> <b>and</b> <b>the</b> team held on win 2–1. The goal was the last ever scored in a FA Cup semi-final replay; it was to be abolished from the following season.|$|E
