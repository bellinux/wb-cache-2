40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe RAH- 66 Comanche's stealth design requires {{the use of}} radar- absorbing material (RAM) on the <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> of the aircraft. The reduced stiffness properties of RAM produce insufficient tail torsional stiffness, necessitating the use of non-radar-absorbing graphite on the <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> of the tail section. This thesis investigates structural design modifications to increase the tail section's stiffness to allow the use of RAM on the <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> and still meet all structural requirements. An original model represents the prototype aircraft at first flight. The goal is to create a model using RAM on the <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> that watches the structural stiffness of the original model. This thesis builds on earlier work conducted at the Naval Postgraduate School (NPS). Two new design modifications to the tailbone are developed. The best modification increases the torsional stiffness of a baseline model by six percent. Integrating earlier NPS modifications increases torsional stiffness by 12 percent. When RAM is applied to the <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> of the modified model, torsional stiffness is reduced by only six percent from the baseline as compared to a 24 percent reduction with no modifications. Additional modifications to the vertical and horizontal stabilizers further increase structural stiffness and reduce weight[URL] United States Arm...|$|R

Transmission electron microscopy images of Pt/C replicas of the membrane's outer surfaces revealed that the pore sizes and shapes in the <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> could be altered by the use of polymers of different intrinsic viscosities as a precursor material as well as changing the stabilization atmosphere and carbonization temperature.

40|$|State {{of the art}} HLFC suction {{panels are}} {{designed}} with an internal chambering to provide the cordspecific suction distribution on the <b>outer</b> <b>skin.</b> This leads {{to a number of}} constraints between aerodynamic, structural design and manufacturing. Also the manufacturing itself is highly complex due to a large number of internal chambers. Current activities of the German Aerospace Center DLR have the goal to simplify this suction nose layout by omitting the internal chambers. For this reason the so called Tailored Skin Single Duct (TSSD) concept was developed. The TSSD is based on a multilayered tailored <b>outer</b> <b>skin</b> with an intrinsic pressure drop distribution. The outer surface is realized by a micro-perforated metallic foil to ensure a homogeneous control of the boundary layer. A specific laminate on the backside of the outer layer provides the necessary cord-wise suction distribution. By the use of this tailored <b>outer</b> <b>skin,</b> only one internal collector duct with a fixed plenum pressure is necessary...|$|R
