40|$|The EHLASS {{survey was}} set up in April 1986 as a five-year {{demonstration}} project. The objective was to monitor home and leisure accidents in a harmonised manner, throughout the EU, to determine their causes, the circumstances of their occurrence, their consequences and, most importantly, to provide information on consumer products involved. Armed with accurate information, it was felt that consumer policy could be directed at the most serious problems andthe best use could be made of available resources. Â  Data collection systems were set up for the collection of EHLASS data in the casualty departments of selected hospitals in each of the member states. The information was subsequently gathered together by the European Commission in Brussels. Extensive analysis was undertaken on 778, 838 accidents reported throughout the EU. Centralised analysis of EHLASS data proved problematic due to lack ofÃ‚Â  co-ordination in data quality. In 1989 it was decided that each member state shouldÃ‚Â  produce its own annual EHLASS report in a <b>harmonised</b> <b>format</b> specified by the European Commission. This report is the ninth such report for Ireland. Download the Report her...|$|E
40|$|To {{what extent}} are governments drawing on {{relevant}} international standards in their technical regulations, as {{mandated by the}} WTO TBT Agreement? A number of sources of data exist, including electronic databases maintained by governments, but they cannot be used to obtain systematic, international perspective, {{because there is no}} harmonised international format and they are incomplete. This study develops an analytical frame for collecting and presenting data on the use of standards in regulation in any sector, as a basis for effective monitoring of the actual extent of use of international standards in regulation and for empirical analysis of the trade effects. This template is then applied to collect and report for five OECD countries detailed factual information on technical regulations, their objectives and standards use in three sectors – electrical household appliances, equipment for natural gas and telephony. The research finds that core government policies confirm the receptiveness of policy and regulation to the use of international standards. It illustrates the difficulty of identifying, for a given sector, which standards are used, for which regulatory objectives, and with which links – direct or indirect – to standards used internationally. The data collected in the <b>harmonised</b> <b>format</b> of the template show how transparency of data on standards use could be improved. Improved transparency can facilitate efforts to improve harmonisation where this can help to remove barriers to trade. Explicit identification of regulatory objectives can ensure that attempts to promote wider harmonisation take account of those objectives. Also, the range of non-national standards actually used as a basis for technical regulation is greater than sometimes acknowledged, and wider knowledge of their availability and use could be helpful to regulators. Another benefit of transparency is that factual presentations of the use of standards in technical regulations provide a source of rich and accurate data for use in empirical work on how regulatory use of standards influences international trade.

50|$|It is {{unlikely}} that California will ever adopt the ABA Model Rules apart beyond <b>harmonising</b> the <b>format</b> and existing California rules that are identical or nearly identical to ABA Model Rules. Reasons for this reluctance include the fact {{there are more than}} 280,000 attorneys licensed in California, so a drastic change from the existing rules to completely different rules would shock the profession and, ultimately, would most likely fail. Additionally, many of California's rules of professional conduct are established by statute and, thus, would require action by the California Legislature to change them; or, alternatively, action by the people of California through the voter initiative process.|$|R
40|$|European Commission has {{established}} an important initiative {{to put in}} place a harmonisation framework for the testing and the health-based evaluation of emissions from building products in the European Union (EU). This will allow overcome the discrepancies present among the various existing national systems that have been put into place to define acceptable levels of chemical pollutants via labelling of indoor product emissions. Moreover, this will also help towards the efficient implementation of the The Construction Products Directive (CPD) / Construction Products Regulation (CPR) as “market tool” to remove “barriers to trade” and allow CE marking as “information tool” to provide a <b>harmonised</b> information <b>format</b> concerning the product emissions performance classes.

30|$|The new {{requirements}} concerning {{communication in}} the supply chain and downstream user compliance are sources of non-compliance with REACH (see a non-exhaustive summary in column 3 of Additional file 4). As a rule, the attached exposure scenarios are neither available in a <b>harmonised</b> and structured <b>format</b> nor aggregated into predictive descriptions that are representative {{for the majority of}} workplaces at the moment. These problems clearly show the need to create a common format for the exposure scenarios and to clearly define and structure the relevant information that has to be transferred from the CSR to the exposure scenario annexed to the SDS. In addition, even though it is legally acceptable to attach all exposure scenarios (see column 2 of Additional file 4), recipients would benefit more if suppliers provided only those exposure scenarios relevant to the recipient.|$|R
40|$|Regarding current {{as well as}} future {{commercial}} {{space transportation}} (CST) projects, new re-entry trajectory profiles, differing from capsule and shuttle-like approaches, {{have to be taken}} into account. These characteristics are mainly ruled by the principle of “landing like an aircraft at an airport” (XCOR, 2015) (DreamChaser, 2015) (Spaceliner, 2015). This directly generates the need to be taken in a system wide information management (SWIM) consideration because of the fact, that all the future air traffic participants are requested to act as SWIM communicating sub-systems by the future Single European Sky Air Traffic Manamement Research (SESAR) SWIM "Intranet for ATM" concept. The presented solution is a SpacecraftReentryHazardAreaService via SWIM whereby an interested client submits the data of an approaching spacecraft in Flight Information eXchange Model (FIXM) format and gets back the potential hazard area as an Aeronautical Information Exchange Model (AIXM) formatted Temporary Flight Restriction (TFR) providing information on the airspace affected and the associated dimensions. This information can then be used for map display purposes, as an assistance information layer on Controller Work Positions (CWP) as well as via Aircraft Access to SWIM (AAtS) on on-board Electronic Flight Bag (EFB) solutions. Against the background of the global character of future CST operations and the associated SWIM harmonisation need referring the U. S. Next Generation Air Transportation System (NextGen) and SESAR, the solution bases on the already <b>harmonised</b> data <b>format</b> standards AIXM and FIXM...|$|R
