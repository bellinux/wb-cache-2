40|$|Studies of tracer {{transport}} in {{the stratosphere}} have shown that adiabatic quasi-horizontal tracer evolution is controlled primarily by the large-scale low-frequency component of the flow. This behavior {{is consistent with the}} concept of chaotic advection, wherein the Eulerian velocity field is spatially coherent and temporally quasi-regular on timescales over which the Lagrangian evolution is chaotic. In this study, winds from a middle atmosphere general circulation model (the Canadian Middle Atmosphere Model) are used to compare and contrast the nature of tracer evolution {{in the stratosphere}} and mesosphere. It is found that the concept of chaotic advection is relevant in the stratosphere but not in the mesosphere. The explanation for this behavior is the increased strength of gravity wave activity in the mesosphere as compared with the stratosphere, which leads to shallower kinetic energy spectra on synoptic scales and a much shorter <b>Eulerian</b> <b>correlation</b> time. The shallower kinetic energy spectra imply that tracer evolution in the mesosphere is spectrally local, in contrast with the spectrally nonlocal regime that prevails in the stratosphere.

40|$|Dynamics of a {{one-dimensional}} {{system of}} Brownian particles with short-range repulsive interaction (diameter sigma) is studied with a liquid-theoretical approach. The mean square displacement, the two-particle displacement correlation, and the overlap-density-based generalized susceptibility are calculated analytically {{by way of}} the Lagrangian correlation of the interparticulate space, instead of the <b>Eulerian</b> <b>correlation</b> of density that is commonly used in the standard mode-coupling theory. In regard to the mean square displacement, the linear analysis reproduces the established result on the asymptotic subdiffusive behavior of the system. A finite-time correction is given by incorporating the effect of entropic nonlinearity with a Lagrangian version of mode-coupling theory. The notorious difficulty in derivation of the mode-coupling theory concerning violation of the fluctuation-dissipation theorem is found to disappear by virtue of the Lagrangian description. The Lagrangian description also facilitates analytical calculation of four-point correlations in the space-time, such as the two-particle displacement correlation. The two-particle displacement correlation, which is asymptotically self-similar in the space-time, illustrates how the cage effect confines each particle within a short radius on one hand and creates collective motion of numerous particles on the other hand. As the time elapses, the correlation length grows unlimitedly, and the generalized susceptibility based on the overlap density converges to a finite value which is an increasing function of the density. The distribution function behind these dynamical four-point correlations and its extension to three-dimensional cases, respecting the tensorial character of the two-particle displacement correlation, are also discussed.

40|$|Simultaneous {{multiple}} point {{measurements of}} the magnetic field from seven spacecraft are employed to estimate the <b>Eulerian</b> <b>correlation</b> function and decorrelation time scales in the near Earth solar wind for two different solar wind speed ranges. We find that the Eulerian decorrelation time scale differs significantly in the slow solar wind (600 km/s) wind, where slab-type turbulence dominates. In slow solar wind, the decorrelation time is 215 ± 43 min, and in fast solar wind, the decorrelation time scale is 114 ± 23 min, which indicates that decorrelation times vary {{with the nature of}} the turbulence. The values reported here are comparable to estimates of decorrelation times based on a number of different models, but do not clearly support or refute any specific solar wind turbulence model. These results may be useful in magnetohydrodynamic modeling of the solar wind and can contribute to our understanding of solar and galactic cosmic ray diffusion in the heliosphere.

Analytical results are derived using linear theory for the <b>Eulerian</b> velocity <b>correlations</b> (single-point, two-time) in the vertical and the horizontal directions, and Lagrangian ones are assumed to be equivalent, in agreement with an additional Corrsin assumption used by Kaneda (2000). They are compared with results from the kinematic simulation model (KS) by Nicolleau & Vassilicos (2000), which also incorporates the wave–vortex dynamics inherited from linear theory, and directly yields Lagrangian correlations as well as Eulerian ones.

The presence of this effect is confirmed numerically, away from the perturbative limit.

Recent applications of large eddy simulation to the evaluation of sound sources in turbulent ows, a problem in which time correlations determine the frequency distribution of acoustic radiation, suggest that subgrid models should also be evaluated by their ability to predict time correlations in turbulent ows. This paper compares the two-point, two-time <b>Eulerian</b> velocity <b>correlation</b> evaluated from direct numerical simulation (DNS) with that evaluated from LES, using a spectral eddy viscosity, for isotropic homogeneous turbulence.

40|$|This {{paper is}} {{concerned}} with the evaluation of two Lagrangian measures which arise in oscillatory or fluctuating shear flows when the fluctuating field is rotational and the spectrum of wave numbers which comprise it is continuous. The measures are the drift and pseudomomentum. Phillips (J. Fluid Mech. 430, 209 (2001)) has shown that the measures are, in such instances, succinctly expressed in terms of Lagrangian integrals of <b>Eulerian</b> space-time <b>correlations.</b> But they are difficult to interpret, and the present work begins by expressing them in a more insightful form. This is achieved by assuming the space-time correlations are separable as magnitude, determined by one-point velocity correlations, and spatial diminution. The measures then parse into terms comprised of the mean Eulerian velocity, one-point velocity correlations, and a family of integrals of spatial diminution, which in turn define a series of Lagrangian time and velocity scales. The pseudomomentum is seen to be strictly negative and related to the turbulence kinetic energy, while the drift is mixed and strongly influenced by the Reynolds stress. Both are calculated for turbulent channel flow for a range of Reynolds numbers and appear, as the Reynolds number increases, to approach a terminal form. At all Reynolds numbers studied, the pseudomomentum has a sole peak located in wall units in the low teens, while at the highest Reynolds number studied, Re&# 0964;= 5200, the drift is negative in the vicinity of that peak, positive elsewhere, and largest near the rigid boundary. In contrast, the time and velocity scales grow almost logarithmically over much of the layer.

40|$|At the epoch of decoupling, cosmic baryons had {{supersonic}} velocities {{relative to}} the dark matter that were coherent on large scales. These velocities subsequently slow the growth of small-scale structure and, via feedback processes, can influence the formation of larger galaxies. We {{examine the effect of}} streaming velocities on the galaxy correlation function, including all leading-order contributions for the first time. We find that the impact on the BAO peak is dramatically enhanced (by a factor of ~ 5) over the results of previous investigations, with the primary new effect due to advection: if a galaxy retains memory of the primordial streaming velocity, it does so at its Lagrangian, rather than <b>Eulerian,</b> position. Since <b>correlations</b> in the streaming velocity change rapidly at the BAO scale, this advection term can cause a significant shift in the observed BAO position. If streaming velocities impact tracer density at the 1 % level, compared to the linear bias, the recovered BAO scale is shifted by approximately 0. 5 %. This new effect, which is required to preserve Galilean invariance, greatly increases the importance of including streaming velocities in the analysis of upcoming BAO measurements and opens a new window to the astrophysics of galaxy formation.

Integral expressions are derived for the modal time-correlation functions of the velocity and scalar fields using the stretched-spiral vortex model.

If {{the motion of the}} centres of the vortex structures is neglected, then an inertial time scaling (#k) - 1 / 3, where # is the energy dissipation rate and k the wavenumber, is found to collapse the velocity and scalar modal time-correlation functions to universal forms. Allowing the centres of the vortex structures to move introduces a sweeping time scale, (uk) - 1, where u is the rms velocity of the centres of the vortex structures. The sweeping time scale dominates the inertial time scale for su#ciently large wavenumbers. Results are also reported for a direct numerical simulation of passive scalar mixing by a turbulent velocity field at a Taylor Reynolds number of 265.

40|$|A {{methodology}} {{has been}} developed to extend the incremental (<b>Eulerian)</b> Digital Image <b>Correlation</b> (DIC) technique to enable a Lagrangian-based large-strain analysis framework to examine the nature of strain and kinematic nonuniformity within shear bands in sands. Plane strain compression tests are performed on dense sands in an apparatus that promotes unconstrained persistent shear band formation. DIC is used to capture incremental, grain-scale displacements in and around shear bands. The performance of the developed accumulation algorithm is validated by comparing accumulated displacements with two sources of reference measurements. A comparison between large and infinitesimal rotation is performed, demonstrating the nature of straining within shear bands in sands {{and the necessity of}} using a finite strain formulation to characterize ensuing behavior. Volumetric strain variation along the shear band is analyzed throughout macroscopic postpeak deformation. During softening, volumetric activity within the shear band is purely dilative. During the global critical state, the shear band material is seen on the average to deform at zero volumetric strain; however, locally, the sand is seen to exhibit significant nonzero volumetric strain, putting into question the current definition of critical state.

40|$|It {{has been}} phenomenologically shown and widely {{supported}} by experiments that statistical properties in small scales of turbulence of incompressible fluids exhibit some universality {{irrespective of the}} kinds of fluids, boundary condition and the Reynolds number. On the other hand, this system is believed to be governed by the Navier-Stokes equations which consist of the equations of motion and of continuity. However, relationships between these equations and phenomenologies on statistical properties of small-scale motions have not been clearly understood primarily because such a statistical theory is hard to construct due to the nonlinearity of the basic equations. Since the nonlinearity causes an infinite hierarchy of moments, we never obtain a closed set of equations for a finite number of statistical quantities without any assumptions. This is the so-called closure problem in the statistical theory of turbulence. We adopt the direct-interaction approximation (DIA), which was originally proposed by Kraichnan (1959), to attack and solve the closure problem. 　　　The DIA is an excellent approximation {{in the sense that the}} nonlinearity is never neglected and no adjustable parameter is introduced in the formulation. Unfortunately, however, it is known that a closed set of equations obtained by a naive application of DIA (Kraichnan 1959) to the Navier-Stokes system is inconsistent with experimental observation. Especially, it is E(k) α k- 3 / 2 that the closure equations predict as the energy spectrum E(k) in the inertial range, where the k- 5 / 3 power law is observed by many experiments. This inconsistency implies incompleteness of the application of DIA to the Navier-Stokes system. Although Kraichnan (1965) improved the application method of DIA and succeeded in deriving the k- 5 / 3 power law, the formulations are too complicated to be justified. Moreover, in spite of its long history and important role in the field of the statistical theory of turbulence, the essence of DIA may have been misunderstood by many researchers. This is due to the fact that validity conditions and applicability of DIA were not clear. 　　　We introduce a model equation, consisting of quadratic nonlinear and linear dissipative terms, which is simpler than the Navier-Stokes equation but still possesses its important mathematical structures. Then, it is shown that DIA is valid for such a system that has weak nonlinear couplings and large numbers of degrees of freedom even if nonlinearity of the system is strong (i. e., the nonlinear terms are larger than the linear ones in magnitude). Furthermore, we clarify similarities and differences between DIA and a Reynolds-number expansion so-called RRE (Reynolds-number reversed expansion). For some known systems, including the Navier-Stokes system and the present model, these two approximations yield an identical set of equations for the correlation and the response functions. Owing to this fact, these two approximations have sometimes been identified erroneously. It must be stressed, however, that DIA and RRE are based upon completely different ideas and working assumptions. Hence, we should distinguish these two theories. This is reasonable because the validity conditions of DIA depend on the strength of nonlinear couplings and the number of degrees of freedom, but not on the Reynolds number, while the validity of RRE depends crucially on magnitude of the Reynolds number. 　　　We further investigate the validity condition of DIA and the relationships between DIA and RRE from a viewpoint of the strength of nonlinear couplings by extending the model equation. It is then shown that DIA is valid for systems such that the average number of direct interactions between a pair of modes is much smaller than the square root of the number of degrees of freedom, and that RRE may be regarded as an approximation under which the nonlinear terms are replaced by a joint-Gaussian random variables. The last approximation, called normal nonlinear term approximation, has the same validity conditions as DIA. 　　　Small-scale motions of turbulence may be statistically homogeneous, and the number of degrees of freedom of this system increases in proportion to the 9 / 4 power of the Reynolds number. Hence, small-scale motions of turbulent fields at high Reynolds number satisfy the two validity conditions of DIA, i. e., weakness of nonlinear couplings and largeness of the degrees of freedom. This implies that DIA is applicable to this system. As mentioned above, however, when we apply DIA to the <b>Eulerian</b> velocity <b>correlation</b> function and the Eulerian velocity response function (Kraichnan 1959), we encounter the difficulty that the resultant closure equations are incompatible with experiments. Here, we instead apply DIA to the Lagrangian velocity correlation function and the Lagrangian response function with the help of the position function (Kaneda 1981), which is a map between the Eulerian and the Lagrangian fields. The resultant equations yield not only the well-known k- 5 / 3 power law predicted phenomenologically by Kolmogorov (1941) of the energy spectrum, but also the functional form in the entire universal range, which excellently agrees with experimental data. 　　　We next apply DIA to passive scalar fields (temperature, particle concentration, smoke, and so on) advected by turbulence without affecting fluid motions. Then it is systematically shown that solutions to the resultant closure equations by DIA for the Lagrangian correlation and the response functions for the velocity and the passive scalar fields are completely consistent with the phenomenologies on the scalar spectrum by Obukhov (1949) and Corrsin (1951) in the inertial-advective range, Batchelor, Howells & Townsend (1959) in the inertial-diffusive range, and Batchelor (1959) in the viscous-advective range...|$|R
