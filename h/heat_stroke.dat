5|$|Being a brachycephalic breed, King Charles Spaniels can be {{sensitive}} to anesthesia. This is because in brachycephalic dogs, there is additional tissue in the throat directly behind the mouth and nasal cavity, known as the pharynx, and anesthesia acts as a muscle relaxant causing this tissue to obstruct the dogs' narrow airways. These narrow airways can decrease the dogs' ability to exercise properly and increase their susceptibility to <b>heat</b> <b>stroke.</b> Other congenital and hereditary disorders found in the King Charles Spaniel are hanging tongue, where a neurological defect prevents the tongue from retracting into the mouth; diabetes mellitus, which {{may be associated with}} cataracts; cleft palate and umbilical hernia. The English Toy Spaniel Club of America recommends that umbilical hernias be corrected only if other surgery is required, due to the risk of surgery in brachycephalic breeds. In another study conducted by the OFA, the King Charles Spaniel was the 38th worst of 99 breeds for patella luxation; of 75 animals tested, 4% were found to have the ailment. However, surveys conducted by the Finnish breed club between 1988 and 2007 found that the occurrences were higher in some years, ranging from 5.3% to 50%.|$|E

He was exposed to politics from an early age; his father took him to several political rallies, including an 1895 speech by Democratic Party leader William Jennings Bryan. His father was a day laborer for the New Albany and St. Louis Air Line Railway. In 1898, he became disabled when he suffered <b>heat</b> <b>stroke</b> while working. His condition meant he could not work; the family became impoverished and had to subsist on the limited yield of their small farm. Minton's mother developed breast cancer in 1899. A traveling doctor attempted to remove her tumors in April 1900, performing the operation with her laid on the family dinner table, but she died during the procedure. The death was an emotional blow to Minton; thereafter, he refused to attend church and spoke against God, whom he blamed for his mother's death. Minton's father married Sarah Montague on December 3, 1901.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Threshold {{limit values}} (TLVs) are {{intended}} to protect workers from the severest effects of thermal stress and to establish the exposures to heat in working conditions. Earlier, acute <b>heat</b> <b>strokes</b> often occurred {{as a result of}} working in hot environments in Japan. However, acute <b>heat</b> <b>strokes</b> recently sometimes occurred in outdoor work environments such as industrial constructions and agriculture. Seasonal variations in weather are significant and the climatic conditions vary. The criteria are mainly set for working in mines, factories, and so on. WBGT is a useful evaluation index for hot environments; however, it is not commonly used for work practices. WBGT could be calculated and should be commonly used as a standard during summer. Japan mainly has a very hot and humid climate during summer. With regard to the thermal standard for offices, humidity also creates a problem in the indoor thermal conditions. Therefore, it is better to decide the TLVs of the thermal conditions according to seasons and activity levels. Inadequate thermal stress may cause discomfort and adversely affect the performance, safety, and harm to health. Further, thermal factors in the work environment must be measured and evaluated under light workload conditions like deskwork for safety and work efficiency...|$|R

25|$|<b>Heat</b> <b>stroke</b> {{can occur}} in dogs, {{especially}} in flat-faced breeds such as the Bulldog or in giant breeds. Breed, lack of water, exercise, and high ambient temperature predispose dogs to <b>heat</b> <b>stroke.</b> Signs include vomiting, diarrhea, collapse, difficulty breathing, and body temperature approaching 42°C to 43°C. Treatment includes cooling the dogs with wet towels and fans, intravenous fluid therapy, and other supportive care. If a dog's temperature begin to drop to around 40°C, stop the cooling process. Once a dog’s body begins to cool, it can drop quickly and getting them too cool can create different problems. Allow the dog {{only a couple of}} laps of water until their temperature begins to drop to a more normal level. Do not allow a dog to gulp large quantities of water. If a dog is panting excessively and then drinks a lot of water, he will swallow large amounts of air with the water and this can cause an equally life-threatening case of gastric dilatation volvulus (bloat) in their stomach.|$|E

The incident was explained away as <b>heat</b> <b>stroke</b> thanks to sympathetic media and team management. Returning from the tour of Australia in 1975, Greig had another epileptic fit at Heathrow Airport. His affliction became public during the Packer furore, when a number of commentators questioned his judgement in the matter and speculated that epilepsy impaired his ability to make decisions.|$|E
25|$|The heavy {{personal}} {{equipment and}} wool {{uniform of the}} regular infantrymen were wholly unsuitable for combat in America, and the outfit was especially ill-suited to comfort and agile movement. During the Battle of Monmouth in late June 1778, the temperature exceeded 100°F (37.8°C) and {{is said to have}} claimed more lives through <b>heat</b> <b>stroke</b> than through actual combat. The standard-issue firearm of the British Army was the Land Pattern Musket. Some officers preferred their troops to fire careful, measured shots (around two per minute), rather than rapid firing. A bayonet made firing difficult, as its cumbersome shape hampered ramming down the charge into the barrel. British troops had a tendency to fire impetuously, resulting in inaccurate fire, a trait for which John Burgoyne criticized them during the Saratoga campaign. Burgoyne instead encouraged bayonet charges to break up enemy formations, which was a preferred tactic in most European armies at the time.|$|E

This combined effect is causing {{a serious threat to}} the health of people because of the changing climate. With climate change, climate variability and thus the occurrence of heat waves is likely to increase. Evidence is emerging from the analysis of long-term climate records of an increase in the frequency and duration of extreme temperature events in all over Bangladesh particularly during summer. Summer season has prolonged while winters have become short in Bangladesh. Summers have become hotter and thus affecting {{the lives of the people}} engaged in outdoor activities during scorching sun hours. In 2003 around 62 people died due to heat wave across the country. In this paper Bangladesh is divided in four regions and heat index has been calculated from 1960 to 2010 in these regions of the country. The aim of this paper is to identify the spots most vulnerable to <b>heat</b> <b>strokes</b> and <b>heat</b> waves due to high heat index. The results show upward trend of heat index in almost all the regions of Bangladesh. The highest increase in heat index value has been observed in areas of South-west region and North-west Region.

40|$|The {{co-occurrence of}} {{consecutive}} {{hot and humid}} days during a heat wave can strongly affect human health. Here, we quantify humid heat wave hazard {{in the recent past}} and at different levels of global warming. We find that the magnitude and apparent temperature peak of heat waves, such as the ones observed in Chicago in 1995 and China in 2003, have been strongly amplified by humidity. Climate model projections suggest that the percentage of area where heat wave magnitude and peak are amplified by humidity increases with increasing warming levels. Considering the effect of humidity at 1. 5 o and 2 o global warming, highly populated regions, such as the Eastern US and China, could experience heat waves with magnitude greater than the one in Russia in 2010 (the most severe of the present era). The apparent temperature peak during such humid-heat waves can be greater than 55 oC. According to the US Weather Service, at this temperature humans are very likely to suffer from <b>heat</b> <b>strokes.</b> Humid-heat waves with these conditions were never exceeded in the present climate, but are expected to occur every other year at 4 o global warming.
