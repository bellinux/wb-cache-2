5000|$|The Hall <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> (also {{called a}} [...] "banjo" [...] signal) {{was the first}} {{electrically}} operated signal to be widely adopted by American railroads. Thomas Hall patented his <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> design in 1867.|$|E
50|$|During 1988, {{the former}} No. 4 and No. 5 tracks were abolished, {{along with a}} number of <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> posts.|$|E
50|$|The {{all-metal}} US&S Enclosed <b>Disc</b> <b>Signal</b> {{was introduced}} in 1896 and had one version that employed both a red and a green banner (as well as both colored glasses) that were mechanically arranged {{in such a way}} as to have the banners and glass roundels exchange places within the signal case as the indication required.|$|E
50|$|The Hall Signal Company {{installed}} the <b>disc</b> <b>signals</b> {{as part of}} automatic block signal systems, initially utilizing line wire circuits, running on poles alongside the tracks, connecting the track treadle devices. One of the earliest such systems was installed in 1871 on the Eastern Railroad (later the Boston & Maine). About 1500 <b>disc</b> <b>signals</b> were operational by 1896.|$|R

5000|$|An {{accident}} {{took place}} at Irongray in 1911 when a passenger train ran into a goods train that {{was sitting in the}} passing loop. No serious injuries were incurred. After 1936 the passing loop was not necessary as the line was operated on a 'one engine in steam' principal; it was removed, however the signal box remained. A level crossing with gates was nearby, interlocked with the signals so that trains could not enter the station unless the gates were closed against road traffic. A electrical ground <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> controlled the movement of tarins from the siding onto the main line.|$|E
5000|$|A banjo-shaped {{wooden case}} housed a large iron wire hoop with red silk {{stretched}} and glued over it. The opposite end {{had a much}} smaller hoop in which a very thin disc of colored glass was secured. This entire iron wire assembly was pivoted inside an electromagnet on what {{was known as a}} [...] "Z" [...] armature which was wound with copper magnet wire. When the coil was energized, the wire hoops were moved away from the large glass opening {{in the front of the}} wooden [...] "banjo" [...] case exposing its white painted insides. The colored glass disc at the same time moving away from a clear primitive Fresnel lens at the top of the case which was backed up on the rear side of the case with a kerosene lamp. The <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> was first placed into service in 1870 on the New York and New Haven Railroad at Stamford, Connecticut, using a track treadle device to activate it, as the revolutionary track circuit was not developed until 1872 by Dr. William Robinson.|$|E
5000|$|Hall's {{response}} to this (for them) dire situation was to buy the 1918 filed patents from one Mr. Blake for his [...] "Searchlight" [...] signal. In reality, the searchlight signal was an updated and modernized variation of the old Hall enclosed <b>disc</b> <b>signal.</b> What Blake had done was to harness the standard railroad three position polarized vane relay, add a miniature spectacle and Pyrex, low expansion Borosilicate glass roundels, and couple that with a very efficient elliptical reflector and optical lens system with a very large 10-1/2 diameter stepped outer lens. This revolutionary development, provided a signal with a visible indication of over {{a mile from the}} signal in broad daylight, when the signal was located on tangent track. The early color light signals were visible for only about half that distance (2,500 feet) while using about the same current consumption, then a major concern in [...] "Primary Battery Territory." [...] By 1925, the development of [...] "High Transmission Colors" [...] of railroad glassware by Churchill and Corning Glass improved this limited distance to an acceptably competitive 3,500 feet on tangent track.|$|E
5000|$|In August 1988, former sidings [...] "A", [...] "B" [...] and [...] "C" [...] and {{associated}} point work were abolished. Also abolished were the Up and Down end crossovers, {{and a number}} of <b>disc</b> <b>signals.</b>|$|R
50|$|Further {{alterations}} {{occurred in}} May 1991, including {{the removal of}} a number of sidings, crossovers, <b>disc</b> <b>signals</b> and signal posts, and the sleeving {{of a number of}} levers. Also during 1991, the electric staff sections Benalla - Glenrowan - Wangaratta were abolished, and were replaced with electric staff section Benalla 'B' Box - Wangaratta.|$|R
5000|$|There {{is also a}} Low speed aspect for calling-on, {{shunting}} or {{entering a}} low speed area such as a goods siding. This is indicated by a small yellow light beneath the two main lights, i.e. Red-over-Red-over-Yellow. Dwarf signals are also used to show Low speed aspects. These were originally upper quadrant <b>disc</b> <b>signals</b> but are now all of the colour light or searchlight variety. The aspects (and indications) are: ...|$|R
50|$|Manuel's track layout {{features}} a long curving loop {{with a short}} headshunt at the west end. The link-line leaves the loop approximately 13 BR Mk1 coach lengths {{from the end of}} the headshunt. A small trap point is located some way up the link line and further up, a gate, signifying the edge of the SRPS's ground. On the approach to Manuel, a fixed distant signal is encountered shortly before the line curves and climbs steeply up to the junction itself. The points at the north-west end of the loop are controlled by a 3-lever ground frame known as Manuel North. The east-facing link line is controlled by a 5-lever ground frame which includes mechanical control of two signals: a raised yellow <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> reads up the link line and up onto Network Rail and a small arm signal prevents moves onto the B&KR. The points at the west end are hand points. Both ground frames are controlled by the train staff using Annett's locks and all signals are tubular upper quadrant in design. The points at the Network Rail end of the link-line are controlled from a ground frame released from Edinburgh SC.|$|E
5000|$|When the GWR goods passed Button's 'clearing point' signal (the {{end of the}} section) at 5:13 am, it {{released}} the treadle and thus allowed the section from Berkeley road to Charfield to be cleared. He then shouted to Gilbert and Sutton of the goods train to shunt and 'pulled off' his shunting <b>disc</b> <b>signal.</b> At this time, nothing {{was out of the}} ordinary. It was less than an hour before dawn, and the railway tracks were shrouded with fog. Due to the fog, Button could not see his down distant signal or his down outer home signal (both were connected to electrical repeaters which showed the signal position via an instrument in his box), but he could see his 'fog object' and therefore saw no need to call out fogmen. The section from Berkeley Road to Charfield was clear, and therefore Button could accept the LMS night mail from Smith. He was perfectly justified in doing so, given that had {{a quarter of a mile}} clear between the clearing point signal and his outer home signal (the first [...] "stop" [...] signal controlled by Charfield box)- there was plenty of space for the mail to stop. The station, however, was occupied by the shunting goods train and therefore his signals stood at danger. He accepted the mail at 5:14 am.|$|E
30|$|The {{distribution}} {{and intensity of}} the AF signal differ in BAF and GAF and cannot be used interchangeably. In BAF, optic <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> is always weaker than in other areas, which was not true for GAF where optic <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> was stronger than fovea and hypoautofluorescent point in both groups.|$|E
5000|$|The Hall Signal Company was an American {{manufacturer}} of railway signaling {{equipment in the}} 19th and 20th centuries. Hall's equipment was widely used by American railroad companies. The company's founder, Thomas S. Hall, was an inventor who developed several important devices {{in the history of}} railway signalling. The company manufactured automatic block <b>signaling</b> systems, <b>disc</b> <b>signals</b> (also called [...] "banjo" [...] signals), a rotating semaphore signal, grade crossing signals, and the first searchlight-style signal.|$|R
50|$|The OS maps of 1896 and 1910 show {{a fairly}} {{significant}} infrastructure {{for such a}} remote location with the double track main line and three sidings running off to a loading dock and {{what may have been}} a goods shed. A brick built 16 lever (in 1919) signal box was situated on the main line with six semaphore signal posts, two ground <b>disc</b> <b>signals,</b> a weighing machine, a cistern, a row of three workers cottages and a square outside toilet block and coal shed. Nearby Lylestone siding had a two lever groundframe.|$|R
5000|$|The first Snow Hill {{station was}} open on 1 October 1852. A special [...] "Eve of Opening" [...] train left Paddington pulled by Daniel Gooches [...] "Lord of the Isles" [...] {{which had been}} on show at the Great Exhibition. This was derailed at Aynho but {{successfully}} completed the journey the following day after a change of engine. Nine years later narrow gauge was extended to Paddington providing a 3 hour 20 minute express service. Unheated carriages were lit by oil pot lamps and bar and <b>disc</b> <b>signals</b> were operated from trackside capstans.|$|R
30|$|Therefore, {{the primary}} {{aim of the}} current study was to assess the {{relationship}} between quantitative measures of disc height and <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity with Pfirrmann scores and to investigate whether different methods of assessing these variables influenced the relationship. We also wished to investigate the inter-rater reliability of the quantitative measures of disc height and <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity.|$|E
30|$|We also {{investigated}} 3 different {{measures of}} <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity. These included (1) a raw <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity measure (2) a ratio adjusted for brightness of CSF (Battié et al. 1995; Videman et al. 1994) {{at the same}} level (ratio 1) and (3) a ratio adjusted for brightest level of CSF at any of the 5 spinal levels (ratio 2). Raw signal intensity was recorded for each disc area as defined above for measurement of disc height. All measurements of signal intensity were made using primary DICOM data, preserving the full dynamic range of the raw data. Ratio 1 was calculated by dividing the raw <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity for each vertebral level by the signal intensity of the CSF at the adjacent level. Ratio 2 was calculated by dividing the raw <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity by the signal intensity of the most intense CSF at any of the 5 spinal levels. A clean sample of CSF adjacent to vertebra levels was used as the intra-body reference standard, accept at stenotic levels where it was difficult to obtain a clean sample so the level of the vertebral body above was used.|$|E
30|$|Our {{results showed}} a linear {{association}} between signal intensity and Pfirrmann scores. The signal intensity decreases {{with the increasing}} extent of disc degeneration according to Pfirrmann scores, except for between grade 4 and 5 where the decrease was not statistically significant. In contrast quantitative measures of disc height were only statistically reduced for the most degenerative discs (Pfirrmann grade 5). Whether we used raw or adjusted measures of <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity or disc height did not substantially change the relationship between disc height or signal intensity with Pfirrmann scores. The quantitative measures of <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity and height had excellent inter-tester reliability.|$|E

5|$|Each passing loop is {{controlled}} by a small signal box, known as a block-post. These house the lever frames that control the points, the token equipment and telephones. The railway has few signals; instead it has stop boards at Pendre, Brynglas, Quarry Siding and Nant Gwernol, and the blockman allows trains to proceed by use of flags. There are colour light signals located at Tywyn Wharf, operated from the Control Office and <b>disc</b> <b>signals</b> controlled from the ground frame. Abergynolwyn has colour light signals, which are operated from the blockpost. When the block-post is unmanned, {{it is the responsibility}} of the locomotive crew to change the token before proceeding.|$|R
30|$|Quantitative {{measures}} of <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity were {{strongly related to}} Pfirrmann scores from grade 1 to 4; however disc height only differentiated between grade 4 and 5 Pfirrmann scores. Using adjusted ratios for quantitative {{measures of}} disc height or signal intensity did not significantly alter the relationship with Pfirrmann scores.|$|E
30|$|There was {{a strong}} linear {{relationship}} between quantitative <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity and Pfirrmann scores for grades 1 – 4, but not for grades 4 and 5. For disc height only, Pfirrmann grade 5 had significantly reduced disc height compared to all other grades. Results were similar regardless of whether raw or adjusted scores were used. Inter-rater reliability for the quantitative measures was excellent (ICC >  0.97).|$|E

Hieatt's motorcycle had sufficient fuel for the race, but a leaking tank forced him into the pits 8 laps from the finish. During the refuelling pitstop, Hieatt also swapped his goggles for a new pair, as the ones he was wearing were covered in mud.After rejoining the race, Hieatt was leading by a lap and a half when an official went out on to the track with a large red <b>disc,</b> <b>signalling</b> Hieatt to slow down to 5 mph, although it seemed Hieatt did not see him.|$|R
30|$|An {{alternative}} approach to measuring <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity, {{which was not}} used in the current study, is T 2 relaxation time mapping (Watanabe et al. 2007). This approach may be more accurate and does not require normalisation to CSF as performed in the current study; however, this approach requires a longer scanning time and a more complex and time consuming analysis making it less practical for routine clinical use.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Recent {{reported}} {{results have}} added to the weight of evidence supporting association between disc degeneration and Modic changes. Endplate or Modic changes are also associated with increased body mass index. The most recent study from Teichtahl et al. titled 'Modic changes in the lumbar spine and their association with body composition, fat distribution and intervertebral disc height - a 3. 0 T-MRI study' showed associations of Modic changes with quantitatively measured reduced disc height and fat mass index. However, there were some facts, which {{we would like to}} address in this Correspondence to their article. DISCUSSION: The different components of intervertebral disc degeneration such as loss of disc height and <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity have already been shown associated with endplate changes - but not disc height if it is assessed using newer more precise methods of quantitation of disc height. A possible protective effect of different adiposity distribution in the body to Modic change development would be of interest if observed in a longitudinal study in the future. Modic changes have been associated with different components of intervertebral disc degeneration such as loss of disc height and <b>disc</b> <b>signal</b> intensity previously. The influence of body fat distribution on endplate changes would be interesting to study longitudinally...|$|E
40|$|Death ligands such as CD 95 L and TRAIL {{initiate}} the extrinsic apoptotic signalling cascade by {{activation of the}} death-inducing <b>signalling</b> complex (<b>DISC).</b> Upon ligand binding to the receptor, the adaptor protein FADD is subsequently recruited to the receptor, thereby allowing for further recruitment of caspase- 8 and its negative regulator cFLIP. In addition to the well-known caspase- 8 -mediated cell death induction, DISC-induced gene expression via the activation of NF-κB ruled {{out to be an}} important signalling pathway. Even if the major key players in <b>DISC</b> <b>signalling</b> have been described, the molecular mechanisms in DISC formation remain to be elucidated. In addition, the function of some DISC-associated proteins is unknown to date. To this day, the role of caspase- 10, a homologue of caspase- 8, in <b>DISC</b> <b>signalling</b> remains unknown and is controversially discussed. In this study, we elucidated the function of caspase 10 in DISC-induced cell death signalling and unexpectedly observed anti-apoptotic features under endogenous protein conditions. In contrast to previous thoughts, our data reveal that caspase- 10 negatively regulates caspase 8 -mediated cell death <b>signalling</b> in the <b>DISC</b> by blocking the recruitment to the complex and thereby the activation of caspase- 8. Furthermore, we demonstrate that caspase 10 functions independent of cFLIP for inhibition of caspase- 8 activation in the DISC. In addition, we show that caspase- 8 does not compete with other tandem DED proteins such as cFLIP or caspase- 10 in binding via FADD to the receptor as current models suggest. By utilising CRISPR-Cas 9 mediated homologous recombination, we generated caspase- 8 knockout cell lines and were able to demonstrate that caspase- 8 has to be placed upstream of both cFLIP and caspase- 10 in the DISC. We found that even FADD association with the DISC was drastically reduced in the absence of caspase- 8. Interestingly, reconstitution of wild type caspase- 8 and its active site mutant rescued the phenotype, indicating that caspase- 8 is indispensable for the formation and/or stability of the DISC independent from its enzymatic activity. Moreover, we identified caspase 10 to promote DISC-mediated NF-κB activation. Caspase- 10 favours at least the degradation of IκBα upon DISC stimulation resulting in enhanced NF-κB activation and inflammatory gene expression. Therefore, our data are consistent with a model in which caspase- 10 rewires <b>DISC</b> <b>signalling</b> to NF-κB activation and cell survival. As a consequence, caspase- 10 and cFLIP co-ordinately regulate caspase- 8 -mediated cell death signalling whereas both proteins contrast in their ability to induce gene expression upon death receptor activation...|$|R
50|$|LaserDisc was a {{composite}} video format: the luminance (black and white) and chrominance (color) information were transmitted in one signal, separated by the receiver. While good comb filters {{can do so}} adequately, these two signals cannot be completely separated. On DVDs, data is stored {{in the form of}} digital blocks which make up each independent frame. The signal produced is dependent on the equipment used to master the <b>disc.</b> <b>Signals</b> range from composite and split, to YUV and RGB. Depending upon which format is used, this can result in far higher fidelity, particularly at strong color borders or regions of high detail (especially if there is moderate movement in the picture) and low-contrast details like skin tones, where comb filters almost inevitably smudge some detail.|$|R
40|$|AbstractApoptosis is {{mediated}} by a highly regulated signal transduction cascade that eventually leads to precisely directed cell death. The death-inducing <b>signaling</b> complex (<b>DISC),</b> composed of Fas, FADD, and caspase- 8, is an apical signaling complex that mediates receptor-induced apoptosis. We have docked the experimentally determined {{structures of the}} Fas and FADD death domains into {{a model of a}} partial <b>DISC</b> <b>signaling</b> complex. The arrangement of Fas and FADD was determined using the interaction modes of the two heterodimer crystal structures determined to date, Pelle/Tube and Apaf- 1 /procaspase- 9. The proposed model reveals that both interactions can be accommodated in a single multimeric complex. Importantly, the model is consistent with reported site-directed mutagenesis data indicating residues throughout the domain are critical for function. These results imply that members of the death domain superfamily have the potential for multivalent interactions, offering novel possibilities for regulation of apoptotic signaling...|$|R
