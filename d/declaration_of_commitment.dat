40|$|Background The aim of {{the study}} was to {{ascertain}} the use <b>of</b> <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> ethical <b>commitment</b> made by medical students graduating from the final-year class of 2006 in Australia and New Zealand, the extent of student contribution to the process and the manner in which those declarations were declared. Methods Information was obtained, by telephone interview and email, from officers or responsible academic staff of faculties of medicine (or medicine and health sciences) in Australia and New Zealand. Results Of 20 medical faculties in Australia and New Zealand, seven were established recently and are yet to graduate students. Thirteen faculties graduated medical students in 2006 and students in 10 of those faculties made <b>declarations</b> on graduating. <b>Of</b> those, six faculties consulted with students in formulating and/or in deciding on the declaration and four gave students major responsibility for writing the declaration. Three faculties invited graduating students to modify the declaration each year. Students in two of those faculties had done so on occasion and, in the third, they had rewritten the declaration each year. Conclusion An increasing proportion of faculties of medicine in Australia and New Zealand provide for a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> ethical values on graduating. We emphasize educational opportunities for reinforcing these values by encouraging students to formulate their 'own' declaration, modify the declaration each year, read the declaration in a formal ceremony and by presenting graduating students with a plaque or printed declaration suitable for framing, which is signed by the Dean and graduating student. 6 page(s...|$|R

5000|$|Willi Bleicher {{remained}} a consistent advocate of trades union unity. This, for him, {{was one of}} the most important lessons from Germany's recently catastrophic history. The Communist Party's anti-trades union policies must accordingly have played a decisive role in triggering his (second) resignation from it in April 1950, even though it was not till the [...] "Munich Party Conference" [...] (actually, and confusingly, held in Weimar in East Germany) of March 1951 that the Communist Party in West Germany (heavily influence by the Soviet backed [...] "communists" [...] in East Germany) were savagely attacked in the grotesque [...] "Thesis 37", accused of running their organisation [...] "at the direction and in the interests of American imperialism and in collusion with German monopolists ... in service to preparation for the next war". In the end the IG Metall union executive reacted very forcefully to the clear threat of factionalism inside the union generated by Communist Party actions. In May 1951 all union officers who were Communist Party members were invited to conform to a <b>declaration</b> <b>of</b> <b>commitment</b> to distance themselves from [...] "Thesis 37".

40|$|The {{fight against}} {{trafficking}} {{in human beings}} (THB) is now part of the French political agenda. Yet the priority is given to the fight against sexual exploitation while labour exploitation is still regarded as a minor phenomenon. The particular issue of exploitation in domestic work has not been considered on its own even if France has been condemned twice by the European Court of Human Rights for failing to protect victims in two cases of exploitation in domestic work. Since then, the law has been amended, and we have to wait until we can assess the effectivity of this new legal framework. The issue of demand remains a blind spot in terms of how THB is understood. The public <b>declarations</b> <b>of</b> government’s <b>commitment</b> to the fight against THB provide a contrast with the low number of convictions actually brought down by the courts. The research highlights the difficulties faced by labor inspectorates and legal actors in establishing cases of THB in domestic work. This is linked with the characteristic of this work sector, but also with confusions in the understanding of what is THB, what are the victims and perpetrators profiles and the tensions between the fight against illegal immigration and the mission to protect victims of THB.
