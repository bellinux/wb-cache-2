Although most of researchers believe that MC are common findings in patients with spinal <b>degenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> and have an association with discogenic LBP, different results between studies may be produced from the differences in study design, inclusion criteria, and sample size. How the present knowledge of MC affects the management of spinal <b>degenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> remains unclear.

40|$|The {{molecular}} {{processes that}} contribute to <b>degenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> are not well understood. Recent observations suggest that some <b>degenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> are promoted by the accumulation of nuclear or cytoplasmic RNA-protein (RNP) aggregates, which {{can be related to}} endogenous RNP granules. RNP aggregates arise commonly in <b>degenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> because RNA-binding proteins commonly self-assemble, in part through prion-like domains, which can form self-propagating amyloids. RNP aggregates may be toxic due to multiple perturbations of posttranscriptional control, thereby disrupting the normal "ribostasis" of the cell. This suggests that understanding and modulating RNP assembly or clearance may be effective approaches to developing therapies for these diseases...|$|R

2500|$|The body {{reacts to}} this in several ways. First, the joint itself is {{continually}} repairing itself and laying down new cartilage. However, cartilage repair {{is a relatively}} slow process, the tissue being avascular, so the joint may suffer degradation due to the abnormal wear and tear, or may not support the body weight as intended. The joint becomes inflamed and a cycle of cartilage damage, inflammation and pain commences. This is a self-fueling process, in that the more the joint becomes damaged, the less able it is to resist further damage. The inflammation causes further damage. The bones of the joint may also develop osteoarthritis, visible on an X-ray as small outcrops of bone, which further degrade the joint. Osteoarthritis is a <b>degenerative</b> <b>disease</b> marked by the breakdown of cartilage between joints resulting in painful bone-to-bone contact.|$|E

40|$|The current {{delay in}} {{retirement}} {{age and the}} changing job opportunities {{have led to a}} progressive aging of the working population with a subsequent increase in work related and chronic <b>degenerative</b> <b>diseases.</b> To assess the relationship between occupational categories and chronic <b>degenerative</b> <b>diseases,</b> the prevalence of respiratory, cardiovascular and musculo-skeletal diseases was evaluated in a sample of 7, 199 male workers. The results indicate that compared to the general population there is a greater prevalence of chronic <b>degenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> among blue-collar workers, porters, and drivers while the prevalence in white-collar workers was not different. The higher prevalence of chronic <b>degenerative</b> <b>diseases</b> in drivers, porters and in blue-collar workers, already at younger ages, suggests that these occupations are wearing jobs and could accelerate the aging process.

2500|$|Age is {{the most}} {{dominant}} factor in hip fracture injuries, with most cases occurring in people over 75. The increase of age {{is related to the}} increase of the incidence of hip fracture, which {{is the most}} frequent cause of hospitalization in centenarians, overcoming congestive heart failure and respiratory infection. Falls are {{the most common cause of}} hip fractures, around 30-60% of older adults fall each year. This increases the risk for hip fracture and leads to the increase risk of death in older individuals, the rate of one year mortality is seen from 12-37%. For those remaining patients who do not suffer from mortality, half of them need assistance and cannot live independently. Also, older adults sustain hip fractures because of osteoporosis, which is a <b>degenerative</b> <b>disease</b> due to age and decrease in bone mass. [...] The average age for suffering a hip fracture is 77 years old for women and 72 years old for men. This shows how closely age is related to hip fractures.|$|E
2500|$|Epitope {{modification}} or Cryptic epitope exposure – {{this mechanism}} of autoimmune disease {{is unique in}} {{that it does not}} result from a defect in the hematopoietic system. [...] Instead, disease results from the exposure of cryptic N-glycan (polysaccharide) linkages common to lower eukaryotes and prokaryotes on the glycoproteins of mammalian non-hematopoietic cells and organs [...] This exposure of phylogenically primitive glycans activates one or more mammalian innate immune cell receptors to induce a chronic sterile inflammatory state. [...] In the presence of chronic and inflammatory cell damage, the adaptive immune system is recruited and self–tolerance is lost with increased autoantibody production. [...] In this form of the disease, the absence of lymphocytes can accelerate organ damage, and intravenous IgG administration can be therapeutic. [...] Although this route to autoimmune disease may underlie various <b>degenerative</b> <b>disease</b> states, no diagnostics for this disease mechanism exist at present, and thus its role in human autoimmunity is currently unknown.|$|E
2500|$|As discussed, {{stem cells}} are used to treat {{degenerative}} diseases. One form of a <b>degenerative</b> <b>disease</b> that can occur in the brain as well as throughout the body is an autoimmune disease. Autoimmune diseases cause the body to [...] "attack" [...] its own cells and therefore destroys those cells as well as whatever functional purpose those cells have or contribute to. One form of an autoimmune disease that affects {{the central nervous system}} is multiple sclerosis. In this disease the body attacks the glial cells that form myelin coats around the axons on neurons. This causes the nervous system to essentially [...] "short circuit" [...] and pass information very slowly. Stem cells therapy has been used to try to cure some of the damage caused by the body in MS. Hematopoietic stem cell transplantation has been used to try and cure MS patients by essentially [...] "reprogramming" [...] their immune system. The main risk encountered with this form of treatment is the possibility of rejection of the stem cells. If the hematopoetic stem cells can be harvested from the individual, risk of rejection is much lower. But, there can be the risk of those cells being programmed to induce MS. However, if the tissue is donated from another individual there is high risk of rejection leading to possibly fatal toxicity in the recipient's body. Considering that there are fairly good treatments for MS, the use of stem cells in this case may have a higher cost than the benefits they produce. However, as research continues perhaps stem cells will truly become a viable treatment for MS as well as other autoimmune diseases.|$|E
