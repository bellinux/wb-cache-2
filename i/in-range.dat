Each one had its own audio track playing on a loop and as visitors approached each one, they became <b>in-range</b> of the infrared signal for that exhibit and their headphones switched to this audio track automatically.

The tracks featured narration by Paul Gambaccini, and who discussed the performer the exhibit was for, along with short sections of their music, background, or history, with these typically lasting {{no more than a few}} minutes each. In practice, the system worked well, but there were a few areas where the signal would be lost or erroneous sounds or drop-outs would be heard. One notable point was that the entire attraction was silent in this respect; originally, all narration, music, and the theatre show sound was delivered entirely to the headphones with no audio being played externally. One side effect of this decision was that visitors in pairs or groups could be heard shouting to each other, as they tried to [...] "talk over" [...] the audio being played via their headphones.|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: Warfarin {{is used as}} an oral anticoagulant. However, {{there is}} wide {{variation}} in patient response to warfarin dose. This variation, {{as well as the}} necessity of keeping within a narrow therapeutic range, means that selection of the correct warfarin dose at the outset of treatment is not straightforward. OBJECTIVES: To assess the effectiveness of different initiation doses of warfarin in terms of time <b>in-range,</b> time to INR <b>in-range</b> and effect on serious adverse events. SEARCH METHODS: We searched CENTRAL, DARE and the NHS Health economics database on The Cochrane Library (2012, Issue 4); MEDLINE (1950 to April 2012) and EMBASE (1974 to April 2012). SELECTION CRITERIA: All randomised controlled trials which compared different initiation regimens of warfarin. DATA COLLECTION AND ANALYSIS: Review authors independently assessed studies for inclusion. Authors also assessed the risk of bias and extracted data from the included studies. MAIN RESULTS: We identified 12 studies of patients commencing warfarin for inclusion in the review. The overall risk of bias was found to be variable, with most studies reporting adequate methods for randomisation but only two studies reporting adequate data on allocation concealment. Four studies (355 patients) compared 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses. All four studies reported INR <b>in-range</b> by day five. Although there was notable heterogeneity, pooling of these four studies showed no overall difference between 5 mg versus 10 mg loading doses (RR 1. 17, 95 % CI 0. 77 to 1. 77, P = 0. 46, I(2) = 83 %). Two of these studies used two consecutive INRs <b>in-range</b> as the outcome and showed no difference between a 5 mg and 10 mg dose by day five (RR 0. 86, 95 % CI 0. 62 to 1. 19, P = 0. 37, I(2  ) = 22 %); two other studies used a single INR <b>in-range</b> as the outcome and showed a benefit for the 10 mg initiation dose by day 5 (RR 1. 49, 95 % CI 1. 01 to 2. 21, P = 0. 05, I(2  ) = 72 %). Two studies compared a 5 mg dose to other doses: a 2. 5 mg initiation dose took longer to achieve the therapeutic range (2. 7 versus 2. 0 days; P < 0. 0001), but those receiving a calculated initiation dose achieved a target range quicker (4. 2 days versus 5 days, P = 0. 007). Two studies compared age adjusted doses to 10 mg initiation doses. More elderly patients receiving an age adjusted dose achieved a stable INR compared to those receiving a 10 mg initial dose (and Fennerty regimen). Four studies used genotype guided dosing in one arm of each trial. Three studies reported no overall differences; the fourth study, which reported that the genotype group spent significantly more time <b>in-range</b> (P < 0. 001), had a control group whose INRs were significantly lower than expected. No clear impacts from adverse events were found in either arm to make an overall conclusion. AUTHORS' CONCLUSIONS: The studies in this review compared loading doses in several different situations. There is still considerable uncertainty between the use of a 5 mg and a 10 mg loading dose for the initiation of warfarin. In the elderly, {{there is some evidence that}} lower initiation doses or age adjusted doses are more appropriate, leading to fewer high INRs. However, there is insufficient evidence to warrant genotype guided initiation...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Intravenous unfractionated heparin {{remains a}} {{cornerstone}} of anticoagulation therapy for patients with acute coronary syndromes, but regulation to a target aPTT is challenging. We assessed unfractionated heparin infusion regulation by bedside, whole-blood aPTT testing and computerized, algorithmic infusion adjustment, and further evaluated the relationship of achieving the target aPTT with clinical outcomes. METHODS AND RESULTS: We studied 1, 275 patients randomized to unfractionated heparin in PARAGON-A, which tested lamifiban with or without unfractionated heparin versus unfractionated heparin. All patients had baseline and 6 -hour blinded, bedside aPTTs, then aPTTs per algorithm. A central computer translated encrypted values to algorithmic dose-adjustment commands. We assessed the ability to achieve and maintain aPTTs of 50 - 70 seconds and associations of 6 - and 12 -hour aPTTs and time-to-target with 30 -day outcomes. Overall, the median 6 -hour aPTT was 50 - 70 seconds and remained so throughout infusion. Individually, only 33. 6 % of patients achieved 6 -hour target-range aPTTs, and only 40 % of all aPTTs were <b>in-range.</b> After achieving target, only 42 % of subsequent measures were <b>in-range.</b> Thirty-day death or myocardial infarction (death/MI) increased non-significantly as time-to-target increased (p = 0. 08). Thirty-day mortality was similar if target aPTT was reached, regardless of timing. Death/MI trended lower if target aPTT was reached by 8 hours (p = 0. 10). The best clinical outcomes were associated with <b>in-range</b> aPTTs. CONCLUSIONS: This study represents the most systematic monitoring and regulation of unfractionated heparin anticoagulation to date. Although average anticoagulation achieved target range, wide inter- and intra-patient variability may {{have important implications for}} clinical outcomes. status: publishe...|$|E

40|$|This study investigates {{application}} of analytical sensor redundancy to improve reliability of gas turbine control system. Analytical redundancy, {{which uses a}} reference engine model to provide redundant estimates of a measured engine variables, has been utilized {{as a basis for}} the proposed sensor fault detection and accommodation method. Model-based compensation of measurement fault is usually resolved by introducing virtual engine sensors, which are obtained via accurate engine modelling. In this paper, a real-time dynamic gas turbine engine model is used in order to generate the redundant virtual measurements. The engine model accuracy directly determines the validity of the modelbased approach for sensor fault diagnosis, and hence a model with auto-tuning capability is deployed as a reference for the gas turbine. The proposed fault detection technique examines the residuals between the redundant channels. Once the discrepancy between the virtual and the sensor measurement exceeds the prescribed tolerance levels, the sensor fault diagnosis determines the state of the switching logic in the dual lane control configuration. The deployed logic is also used for reconfiguration of the auto-tuning process. When a sensor fault occurs, the estimation process is affected, and hence the tuning process must be adjusted to account for this deficiency. Single and multiple sensor failures are simulated during the gas turbine transient manoeuvre to assess capability of the proposed model-based detection and accommodation method. Hard (large <b>in-range)</b> and soft sensor failures (small <b>in-range</b> or drift) are injected during the numerical simulation and results are presented...|$|E

30|$|A {{number of}} studies have been {{conducted}} in the Veterans Affairs anticoagulation clinics around the New England area. The studies mainly focus on the effect of other diseases on the quality of anticoagulation control, comparison of different patient groups (e.g., based on race) on the INR and therapeutic time in range (TTR), predictors of anticoagulation control, and the comparison of performance among ACCs. In particular, Razouki et al. (2014 a, b) examine the prediction of adverse events by using the variability of INR and TTR. They conclude that the variability in INR, independent of TTR, can be used to predict Warfarin adverse effects. Rose et al. (2011) examine the relationship between anticoagulation control and follow-up intervals after obtaining an <b>in-range</b> INR. Although shorter intervals are generally associated with better anticoagulation control, some long intervals such as 28  days after obtaining the first or second <b>in-range</b> value and a longer interval after obtaining the third in-value range may be considered as appropriate. Therefore, frequent monitoring of patients in terms of INR is necessary. Efird et al. (2014) focus on identifying which patients with liver disease might safely receive Warfarin. They show that patients with liver disease have lower TTR and more hemorrhages. Rao et al. (2014) discuss racial disparity in the anticoagulation control. They report that the mean unadjusted TTR for black patients is 6.5 % lower than that for white patients. However, the process of care measures has minimal additional effect on the racial disparity. Therefore, anticoagulation treatments need to be individualized, which calls for the consistent interactions between patients and their care providers.|$|E

40|$|This work {{considers}} {{the problem of}} causing multiple (100 `s) autonomous mobile robots to converge to a target and provides a follow-the-leader approach to the problem. Each robot has only a limited-range sensor for sending the target and also larger but also limited-range robot-to-robot communication capability. Because of {{the small amount of}} information available to the robots, a practical approach to improve convergence to the target is to have a robot follow the robot with the best quality of information. Specifically, each robot emits a signal that informs <b>in-range</b> robots what its status is. A robot has a status value of 0 if it is itself in range of the target. A robot has a status of 1 if it is not in range of the target but is in communication range of a robot that is in range of the target. A robot has a status of 2 if it is not in range of the target but is within range of another robot that has status 1, and so on. Of all the mobile robots that any given robot is in range of, it follows the one with the best status. The emergent behavior is the ant-like trails of robots following each other toward the target. If the robot is not in range of another robot that is either in range of the target or following another robot, the robot will assign- 1 to its quality-of-information, and will execute an exhaustive search. The exhaustive search will continue until it encounters either the target or another robot with a nonnegative quality-of-information. The quality of information approach was extended to the case where each robot only has two-bit signals informing it of distance to <b>in-range</b> robots...|$|E
