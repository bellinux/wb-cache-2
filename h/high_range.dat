5|$|Hard rock {{is a form}} of loud, {{aggressive}} rock music. The {{electric guitar}} is often emphasised, used with distortion and other effects, both as a rhythm instrument using repetitive riffs with a varying degree of complexity, and as a solo lead instrument. Drumming characteristically focuses on driving rhythms, strong bass drum and a backbeat on snare, sometimes using cymbals for emphasis. The bass guitar works in conjunction with the drums, occasionally playing riffs, but usually providing a backing for the rhythm and lead guitars. Vocals are often growling, raspy, or involve screaming or wailing, sometimes in a <b>high</b> <b>range,</b> or even falsetto voice.|$|E
5|$|Deaths during {{training}} accidents {{make up the}} majority of the SASR's fatalities. The worst accident in the regiment's history occurred on the evening of 12 June 1996 when two S-70-A9 Black Hawk helicopters from the 5th Aviation Regiment carrying SASR troopers collided during a live-fire counter-terrorism/special-recovery operation exercise at Fire Support Base Barbara in the <b>High</b> <b>Range</b> Training Area near Townsville, Queensland. This activity was part of Exercise Day Rotor 96 and took place {{on the second day of}} the exercise, sometime after 18:30, requiring the pilots to use night vision goggles. Six aircraft had been approaching the target area when, 30 seconds from the landing zone, one of the helicopters veered to the right, clipping the tail rotor of another helicopter. One Black Hawk crashed immediately killing 12 personnel on board, while the other was able to make a crash landing but burst into flames, killing six. Crash survivors, soldiers from the other helicopters and exercise staff risked the flames and exploding ammunition to rescue their comrades and retrieve the bodies of the dead. Fifteen members of the SASR and three from the 5th Aviation Regiment lost their lives in the accident. Fourteen personnel were later officially recognised for their part in the rescue and evacuation operation.|$|E

25|$|The {{increase}} in respiration rate {{from the low}} range to the <b>high</b> <b>range</b> is sudden and occurs in response to hyperthermia. Birds lack sweat glands, so when placed under stress due to heat, they heavily rely upon increased evaporation from the respiratory system for heat transfer. This rise in respiration rate however is not necessarily associated with a greater rate of oxygen consumption. Therefore, unlike other birds, the common ostrich is able to dissipate heat through panting without experiencing respiratory alkalosis by modifying ventilation of the respiratory medium. During hyperpnea ostriches pant at a respiratory rate of 40–60 cycles per minute, versus their resting rate of 6–12 cycles per minute. Hot, dry and moisture lacking properties of the common ostrich respiratory medium affects oxygen's diffusion rate (Henry's Law).|$|E

25|$|The {{input to}} a belt press filter is {{generally}} measured as {{the rate of}} dry solids loading (mass of dry solids per time per belt width). Again, the input solids loading {{is dependent on the}} sludge type and filter media, thus there is great variation in the dry solids loading rates of operating belt press filters. Typically, lower range solids loading rates fall in the range of 40–230kg/h/m belt width and <b>high</b> <b>range</b> solids loading rates fall in the range of 300–910kg/h/m belt width. Whilst loading is important for measuring production rate, {{it is also important to}} consider the thickness of the cake that forms in the gravity drainage section. Cake thickness affects the permeability of the filtration media and the filtration rate. Testing for the particular sludge type must be conducted to determine the optimum cake thickness. In some cases where filtrate recovery is important, it may be necessary to introduce a cake washing step.|$|E
500|$|... "Love On Top" [...] {{is a song}} {{recorded}} by American singer Beyoncé for her fourth studio album 4 (2011). Inspired from her state of mind while playing Etta James in the 2008 musical biopic Cadillac Records, Beyoncé wrote the song alongside Terius Nash and Shea Taylor; its production was handled by Taylor and Beyoncé. A throw-back to 1980s music, the uptempo R song exhibits style {{similar to that of}} Stevie Wonder, Whitney Houston and The Jackson 5, among others. While incorporating four key changes, Beyoncé adopts a <b>high</b> <b>range</b> when repeating the song's chorus {{towards the end of the}} song. She sings about a man whom she can always call, even after facing grief and hard work, finally earning his love and respect.|$|E
500|$|Hindustan Times writer Robin Bansal was {{impressed}} with the song, and called it [...] "eclectic, peppy, and electrifying from the start... The song explodes after a point in its massiveness and stays in the head. The impeccable notes and pitch makes one wonder if it's really Priyanka." [...] He added that the song had a high tempo and pitch, making it more like a track by The Black Eyed Peas. Chopra refuted the claims that her voice was digitally modulated, and said she has a <b>high</b> <b>range</b> in her voice, and that she always had an accent while speaking English. Perdy Mohindru from The Times of India described the lyrics as simple and beautiful, and complemented Chopra's accent and voice.|$|E

500|$|The role of Mopsa was {{originally}} {{performed by a}} soprano; however, a later revision by Purcell stated that {{it was to be}} performed by [...] "Mr. Pate in woman's habit", presumably to have a grotesque effect and highlight the refrain [...] "No, no, no, no, no; no kissing at all" [...] in the dialogue between Corydon and Mopsa. Also, it is not entirely clear what the word [...] "countertenor" [...] means in this context. The record is ambivalent as to whether Purcell (himself a countertenor) used a tenor with a particularly <b>high</b> <b>range</b> (though lighter at the top) and tessitura (known sometimes as a haute-contre, the descendants of the contratenors alti of medieval polyphony) or a falsettist. It seems that throughout his career he used both. [...] However, purely for reasons of dramatic verisimilitude, it is more likely than not that the travesty role of Mopsa was taken by a falsettist, and the presence of a duet for two male altos ("Let the fifes and the clarions") makes it seem more probable that for this work falsettists were employed.|$|E
500|$|Becky Bain of {{the website}} Idolator viewed [...] "Love On Top" [...] as [...] "joyful tune {{that doubles as}} a throwback to a simpler time" [...] and added that Beyoncé's energy is [...] "infectious". Conrad Tao of Sputnikmusic showed high favoritism towards [...] "Love On Top", writing: [...] " [...] as she forces herself into a rarely used <b>high</b> <b>range,</b> she sets for a perfect {{catharsis}} for the burgeoning sexual passions of the album's first two thirds", and describing the outcome as [...] "absolutely magnificent". Melinda Newman of HitFix commented [...] "the soulful, exuberant, mid-tempo finger snapper, 'Love On Top' is deliciously sunny and sweet." [...] James Reed of The Boston Globe wrote that [...] "Love on Top' sounds like the pretty young thing of Michael Jackson's 'P.Y.T.' grew up to make a sequel to that 1983 hit." [...] Similarly, Joanne Dorken of MTV UK who described [...] "Love On Top" [...] as [...] "scream 'classic disco', catchy, [...] more uptempo and differing {{from the rest of the}} album", concluded that the song shows Beyoncé's versatility and that it is [...] "very Jackson 5". Ben Cardew of Music Week stated that [...] "Love On Top" [...] is summery and [...] "laidback, rather than massively immediate". However, he added that it proves to be a grower as it [...] "ratchets up the key changes on the final third", further writing that Beyoncé's voice sounds [...] "particularly impressive". A mixed review came from Adam Markovitz of Entertainment Weekly, who compared Beyoncé's work on [...] "Love On Top" [...] to that of past idols such as Luther Vandross and Diana Ross, but felt the tone overshadowed her style, stating [...] "she gets lost in her idols' polyester-swathed shadows." [...] Jon Caramanica of The New York Times noted that the song was [...] "slinky but nowhere near sexy" [...] adding that it sounds like a song young Brandy Norwood would release.|$|E
