5|$|People {{identifying}} with Asperger syndrome may refer to themselves in casual conversation as aspies (a term first used in print by Liane Holliday Willey in 1999). The word neurotypical (abbreviated NT) describes a person whose neurological development and state are typical, {{and is often}} used to refer to non-autistic people. The Internet has allowed individuals with AS {{to communicate with each other}} in a way that was not previously possible because of their rarity and geographic dispersal, forming a subculture composed of people with Asperger's. <b>Internet</b> <b>sites</b> like Wrong Planet have made it easier for individuals to connect.|$|E
5|$|A {{different}} {{school of}} thought developed {{almost half a century}} later, with palaeontologist David Weishampel suggesting that the skeletons from the lower layers stemmed from a herd that died catastrophically in a mudflow, while those in the upper layers accumulated over time. Weishampel explained the curious monospecific assemblage by theorizing that Plateosaurus were common during this period. This theory was erroneously attributed to Seemann in a popular account of the plateosaurs {{in the collection of the}} Institute and Museum for Geology and Palaeontology, University of Tübingen, and has since become the standard explanation on most <b>internet</b> <b>sites</b> and in popular books on dinosaurs. Rieber proposed a more elaborate scenario, which included the animals dying of thirst or starvation, and being concentrated by mudflows.|$|E

A recent trend is the increased availability of pre-school educational CDs and DVDs. Such media also prove popular with the extensive Afrikaans-speaking expatriate communities who seek to retain language proficiency in a household context.|$|E
