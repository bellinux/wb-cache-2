40|$|Stochastic convex {{programs}} <b>with</b> <b>recourse</b> can equivalently be formulated as nonlinear convex programming problems. These possess {{some rather}} marked characteristics. Firstly, {{the proportion of}} linear to nonlinear variables is often large and leads to a natural partition of the constraints and objective. Secondly, the objective function corresponding to the nonlinear variables can vary {{over a wide range}} of possibilities; under appropriate assumptions about the underlying stochastic program it could be, for example, a smooth function, a separable polyhedral function or a nonsmooth function whose values and gradients are very expensive to compute. Thirdly, the problems are often large-scale and linearly constrained with special structure in the constraints. This paper is a comprehensive study of solution methods for stochastic programs <b>with</b> <b>recourse</b> viewed from the above standpoint. We describe a number of promising algorithmic approaches that are derived from methods of nonlinear programming. The discussion is a fairly general one, but the solution of two classes of stochastic programs <b>with</b> <b>recourse</b> are of particular interest. The first corresponds to stochastic linear programs <b>with</b> simple <b>recourse</b> and stochastic right-hand-side elements with given discrete probability distribution. The second corresponds to stochastic linear programs <b>with</b> complete <b>recourse</b> and stochastic right-hand-side vectors defined by a limited number of scenarios, each with given probability.

40|$|Abstract—Long design cycles {{due to the}} {{inability}} to predict silicon realities are a well-known problem that plagues analog/RF integrated circuit product development. As this problem worsens for nanoscale IC technologies, {{the high cost of}} design and multiple manufacturing spins causes fewer products to have the volume required to support full-custom implementation. Design reuse and analog synthesis make analog/RF design more affordable; however, the increasing process variability and lack of modeling accuracy remain extremely challenging for nanoscale analog/RF design. We propose a regular analog/RF IC using metal-mask configurability design methodology Optimization <b>with</b> <b>Recourse</b> of Analog Circuits including Layout Extraction (ORACLE), which is a combination of reuse and shared-use by formulating the synthesis problem as an optimization <b>with</b> <b>recourse</b> problem. Using a two-stage geometric programming <b>with</b> <b>recourse</b> approach, ORACLE solves for both the globally optimal shared and application-specific variables. Furthermore, robust optimization is proposed to treat the design with variability problem, further enhancing the ORACLE methodology by providing yield bound for each configuration of regular designs. The statistical variations of the process parameters are captured by a confidence ellipsoid. We demonstrate ORACLE for regular Low Noise Amplifier designs using metal-mask configurability, where a range of applications share common underlying structure and application-specific customization is performed using the metal-mask layers. Two RF oscillator design examples are shown to achieve robust designs with guaranteed yield bound.

In this article, {{we will look at}} a new variant of it, called the two-stage optimization <b>with</b> <b>recourse</b> and revocation model. This new model differs from the traditional one in that one is allowed to revoke some of his earlier decisions and withdraw part of the earlier costs, which is not unlikely in many real applications, and is therefore considered to be more realistic under many situations. We will adopt several approaches to study this model. In fact, we will develop an LP rounding scheme for some cover problems and show that they can be solved using this scheme and an adaptation of the rounding approach for the deterministic counterpart, provided the polynomial scenario assumption. Stochastic uncapacitated facility location problem will also be studied to show that the approximation algorithm that worked for the two-stage <b>with</b> <b>recourse</b> model worked for this model as well.
