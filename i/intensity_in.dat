5|$|About thirty-five {{natural forest}} fires are ignited {{each year by}} lightning, while another six to ten are started by people— in most cases by accident. Yellowstone National Park has three fire lookout towers, each staffed by trained fire fighters. The easiest one to reach is atop Mount Washburn, which has interpretive {{exhibits}} and an observation deck open to the public. The park also monitors fire from the air and relies on visitor reports of smoke and/or flames. Fire towers are staffed almost continuously from late June to mid-September— the primary fire season. Fires burn with the greatest <b>intensity</b> <b>in</b> the late afternoon and evening. Few fires burn more than , {{and the vast majority}} of fires reach only a little over an acre (0.5ha) before they burn themselves out. Fire management focuses on monitoring dead and down wood quantities, soil and tree moisture, and the weather, to determine those areas most vulnerable to fire should one ignite. Current policy is to suppress all human caused fires and to evaluate natural fires, examining the benefit or detriment they may pose on the ecosystem. If a fire is considered to be an immediate threat to people and structures, or will burn out of control, then fire suppression is performed.|$|E
5|$|Although the Seven Years' War was {{a global}} conflict, {{it took on}} a {{specific}} <b>intensity</b> <b>in</b> the European theater based on the recently concluded War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). The 1748 Treaty of Aix-la-Chapelle gave FrederickII of Prussia, known as Frederick the Great, the prosperous province of Silesia. Empress Maria Theresa of Austria had signed the treaty to gain time to rebuild her military forces and forge new alliances; she was intent upon regaining ascendancy in the Holy Roman Empire as well as reacquiring Silesia. In 1754, escalating tensions between Great Britain and France in North America offered France an opportunity to break the British dominance of Atlantic trade. Recognizing the opportunity to regain her lost territories and to limit Prussia's growing power, the Empress put aside the old rivalry with France {{to form a new}} coalition. Faced with this turn of events, Britain aligned herself with the Kingdom of Prussia; this alliance drew in not only the British king's territories held in personal union, including Hanover, but also those of his and Frederick's relatives in the Electorate of Brunswick-Lüneburg and the Landgraviate of Hesse-Kassel. This series of political maneuvers became known as the Diplomatic Revolution.|$|E

5|$|Around 05:00UTC on November9, the cyclone made {{landfall}} at peak <b>intensity</b> <b>in</b> eastern India, {{near the}} state borders of Andhra Pradesh and Odisha, {{and close to}} the city of Ichchapuram.

After moving ashore, the storm turned more to the north and rapidly weakened over land. By 12:00UTC on November9, the JTWC discontinued advisories. The storm weakened into a depression over the northern Bihar state early on November10. On the next day, the system degenerated into a remnant low, by which time the system had turned to the northeast and spread into Nepal.

5|$|During {{the evening}} of June24, Hurricane Celia {{intensified}} into a powerful Category5 storm, further solidifying it as the strongest of the 2010 Pacific hurricane season. At its peak, the cyclone attained winds of 160mph (260km/h) along with a minimum pressure of 921mbar (hPa; 27.2inHg). This ranks it as the second-strongest June hurricane on record, {{as well as the}} eleventh-strongest in the basin, and the second known Category5 to develop during the month on record. The strongest and first known storm of this <b>intensity</b> <b>in</b> June was Hurricane Ava in 1973. Additionally, it also marked the first time on record that two consecutive seasons featured Category5 hurricanes, with Hurricane Rick in October 2009 reaching this intensity, the second time two consecutive seasons had a category 5 hurricane was when hurricanes Marie and Patricia formed in 2014 and 2015 respectively. In the National Hurricane Center's monthly tropical weather summary for June 2010, it was stated that the accumulated cyclone energy (ACE) for the month was the highest on record, most of which is attributed to Hurricane Celia.|$|E
5|$|Early on October8, {{after turning}} west-southwestward {{away from the}} Greater Antilles, Iris began {{strengthening}} again, with warm waters and an absence of significant wind shear. The NHC predicted peak winds of 105mph (165km/h) before the storm would hit Belize. It rapidly intensified with the favorable conditions, intensifying from 95mph (150km/h) to 140mph (225km/h) in a 12-hour period on October8, making Iris a Category 4 hurricane on the Saffir-Simpson scale; in the same duration, the minimum central pressure dropped 38mbar (1.12inHg). While intensifying, the hurricane developed concentric eyewalls, with an innermost eye having a diameter of 7mi (11km). For comparison, the smallest known eye diameter on record for an Atlantic hurricane was about 3mi (5km), during Hurricane Wilma in 2005. With such a small eye, a Hurricane Hunters flight could not deploy a dropsonde {{into the center of}} Iris, and shortly after the flight, the innermost eye collapsed as the core paralleled the Honduras coastline just offshore. This resulted in a temporary and slight weakening during an eyewall replacement cycle, but within a few hours Iris re-intensified to attain peak winds of 145mph (230km/h) just off Belize. At 02:00UTC on October9, it made landfall at peak <b>intensity</b> <b>in</b> Monkey River Town in the southern portion of Belize.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. This paper {{presents}} a variational level set approach to joint segmentation and bias correction of images with intensity inhomogeneities. Our method {{is based on}} an observation that <b>intensities</b> <b>in</b> a relatively small local region are separable, despite of the inseparability of the <b>intensities</b> <b>in</b> the whole image caused by the intensity inhomogeneity. We first define a weighted K-means clustering objective function for image <b>intensities</b> <b>in</b> a neighborhood around each point, with the cluster centers having a multiplicative factor that estimates the bias within the neighborhood. The objective function is then integrated over the entire domain and incorporated into a variational level set formulation. The energy minimization is performed via a level set evolution process. Our method is able to capture bias of quite general profiles. Moreover, it is robust to initialization, and thereby allows automatic applications. The proposed method has been used for images of various modalities with promising results. ...|$|R
