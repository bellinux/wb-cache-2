5|$|Many {{landmarks}} {{have been}} designated with National Historic Landmark status by the United States Secretary of the Interior for historical significance. All of those {{and a number}} of other districts, sites, buildings, structures, and objects worthy of preservation have been listed on the National Register of Historic Places. Not all Chicago Landmarks have been listed on the National Register, and not all Registered Historic Places (not <b>even</b> <b>all</b> of those that are further designated National Historic Landmarks) have been designated Chicago Landmarks. No Chicago Landmarks are classified as any other type of National Park System protected area including National Parks, National Monuments, or National Preserves. The charts below detail these designations for the city of Chicago-designated sites and the National Historic Landmarks.|$|E
5|$|The historiography of Vithoba and his cult {{is an area}} of {{continuing}} debate, even regarding his name. Various Indologists have proposed a prehistory for Vithoba worship where he was previously: a hero stone, a pastoral deity, a manifestation of Shiva, a Jain saint, or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> of these at various times for various devotees. Though the origins of both his cult and his main temple are likewise debated, there is clear evidence that they already existed by the 13th century.|$|E
5|$|After {{the other}} {{candidates}} had been nominated, the first ballot showed Grant leading with 304 votes and Blaine in second with 284; Sherman's 93 placed him in a distant third, and no candidate had the required majority of 379. Sherman's delegates could swing the nomination to either Grant or Blaine, {{but he refused to}} release them through twenty-eight ballots {{in the hope that the}} anti-Grant forces would desert Blaine and flock to him. By the end of the first day, it was clear that neither Grant nor Blaine could muster a majority; a compromise candidate would be necessary. Sherman held out hope that he would be that compromise candidate, but while his vote tally reached as high as 120, he never commanded <b>even</b> <b>all</b> of Ohio's delegates. His divided home-state support was likely fatal to his cause, as Blaine delegates, searching for a new champion, did not think Sherman would make a popular candidate. After several days of balloting, Blaine's men found their compromise candidate, but instead of Sherman they shifted their votes to his fellow Ohioan, Garfield. By the thirty-sixth ballot, Garfield had 399 votes, enough for victory.|$|E

5|$|As in all Norwegian {{national}} parks, motorized {{land transport}} is banned. However, on Svalbard {{this does not}} include snowmobiles. On the other hand, cycling is banned. The Governor can, however, enforce temporary bans on snowmobiles or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> travel within the national park. Use of helicopters and aircraft for sight-seeing are also prohibited. Polar bears are protected, but anyone outside of settlements is required to carry a rifle to kill polar bears in self-defense, as a last resort, should they attack. Most flora and fauna are protected; the right to gather established with the freedom to roam does not apply in national parks, although there are some exceptions. Hunting is permitted after explicit permit from the Governor, and locals have more access to hunting rights than tourists. Fishing is not permitted, although dispensations can be given.|$|E
25|$|Many or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> of {{the stands}} may be {{replaced}} by a drum rack, particularly useful for large drum kits.|$|E

25|$|The Baconian {{hypothesis}} of Shakespearean authorship, first {{proposed in the}} mid-19th century, contends that Francis Bacon wrote some or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> of the plays conventionally attributed to William Shakespeare.|$|E
25|$|The {{number of}} Torah-scrolls taken {{out for the}} Kol Nidrei varied {{according}} to different customs. In some places it was one; in others, two, three, seven, or <b>even</b> <b>all.</b> The first Torah-scroll taken out is called the Sefer Kol Nidrei.|$|E
25|$|Flowering begins {{within the}} first six months after planting. In {{seasonally}} cool regions, flowering only occurs once a year between April and June. In more constant seasonal temperatures and with constant rainfall, flowering can happen twice or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> year-round.|$|E

25|$|Chemical {{structures}} may {{be written}} in more compact forms, particularly when showing organic molecules. In condensed structural formulas, many or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> of the covalent bonds may be left out, with subscripts indicating the number of identical groups attached to a particular atom.|$|E
25|$|Scrap metals {{were needed}} to build tanks and aircraft, so {{hundreds}} of Penarth homes lost their traditional Victorian iron railings from the front gardens during the war years. <b>Even</b> <b>All</b> Saints' Church in Victoria Square lost its magnificently ornate gates and the railing fence that surrounded the square's green.|$|E

25|$|Much {{sophisticated}} and important thought {{has taken place}} after the writing of Marx and Engels; much or perhaps <b>even</b> <b>all</b> {{of it has been}} influenced, subtly or overtly, by Marxism. Simply dismissing all philosophy as sophistry might condemn Marxism to a simplistic empiricism or economism, crippling it in practice and making it comically simplistic at the level of theory.|$|E
25|$|It can {{separate}} many or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> actinides {{at once and}} produce highly radioactive fuel which is harder to manipulate for theft or making nuclear weapons. (However, the difficulty has been questioned.) In contrast the PUREX process was designed to separate plutonium only for weapons, and it also leaves the minor actinides (americium and curium) behind, producing waste with more long-lived radioactivity.|$|E
25|$|Clubs are not {{required}} to close at a fixed time during the weekends, and many parties last well into the morning, or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> weekend. The Berghain features the well-known Panorama Bar, a bar that opens its shades at daybreak, allowing party-goers a panorama view of Berlin after dancing through the night. The Weekend Club near Alexanderplatz features a roof terrace that allows partying at night. Several venues have become a popular stage for the Neo-Burlesque scene.|$|E

60|$|It was <b>evening.</b> <b>All</b> sail was set. Not {{a puff of}} wind {{rendered}} {{that display}} available. The reef-points pattered as the yacht rolled gracefully {{from side to side}} on the gentle heave of the Mediterranean's bosom.|$|R

25|$|After the Hillsborough Disaster, the British {{government}} {{commissioned the}} Taylor Report {{which resulted in}} standing being banned from many stadiums, including every top league stadium. Groups such as Stand Up Sit Down are campaigning for its return. This {{is very different from}} the situation in British non-league football and other leagues around the world where it is common to see terracing (standing areas) making up some, or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> of the room for fans.|$|E
25|$|At {{the same}} time, {{some of the}} criticisms that have been {{directed}} at the ABC methods, in particular {{within the field of}} phylogeography, are not specific to ABC and apply to all Bayesian methods or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> statistical methods (e.g., the choice of prior distribution and parameter ranges). However, because of the ability of ABC-methods to handle much more complex models, some of these general pitfalls are of particular relevance in the context of ABC analyses.|$|E
25|$|Set {{theory is}} also a {{promising}} foundational system for much of mathematics. Since {{the publication of the}} first volume of Principia Mathematica, it has been claimed that most or <b>even</b> <b>all</b> mathematical theorems can be derived using an aptly designed set of axioms for set theory, augmented with many definitions, using first or second order logic. For example, properties of the natural and real numbers can be derived within set theory, as each number system can be identified with a set of equivalence classes under a suitable equivalence relation whose field is some infinite set.|$|E
60|$|At last, at {{six in the}} <b>evening,</b> <b>all</b> {{opposition}} ceased, and {{the troops}} marched into the old parade ground of Cawnpore, having performed a twenty- two miles' march, and fought for five hours, beneath a sun of tremendous power.|$|R

50|$|At this {{workshop}} {{staff and}} students reviewed 33 experiments {{submitted by the}} different participating universities.
