50|$|Curcuminoids form a {{more stable}} complex with {{solutions}} which contain cyclodextrin towards <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradations.</b> The stability differs between size and characterization of the cyclodextrins that are used. Dissolution of demethoxycurcumin, bisdemethoxycurcumin and curcumin are greatest in the hydroxypropyl-γ-cyclodextrin (HPγCD) cavity. The curcuminoids which have a substituent connected to the phenyl groups show more affinity for the HPγCD compound. Degradation rate is depended on pH of the solution and how much protection the cyclodextrins provide the curcuminoids. The derivatives are usually more stable than curcumin against hydrolysis in cyclodextrin solution. No covalent bonds are present between the cyclodextrins and the curcuminoids so they are easily released from the complex by simple solvent effects.|$|R
40|$|Polymeric and lipid nanocapsules {{suspensions}} of {{the natural}} compound curcumin were prepared in order to overcome limitations associated with its clinical applications, such as poor aqueous solubility and susceptibility to <b>hydrolytic</b> and photochemical <b>degradation.</b> Nanocapsule suspensions were prepared by nanoprecipitation and phase inversion methods, respectively. The curcumin formulations were investigated for physicochemical characteristics and in vitro drug release. The <b>hydrolytic</b> and photochemical <b>degradation</b> of the drug associated with the nanocarriers was also determined. For all formulations, the entrapment efficiency values were higher than 99 %. The aqueous colloidal suspensions of curcumin resulted {{in an increase in}} drug concentration by a factor of up to 46. 103 times. Moreover, stability studies indicated that nanoencapsulation slows down the <b>hydrolytic</b> and photochemical <b>degradations</b> of curcumin. The strategy of nanoencapsulation into polymeric and lipid nanocapsules produced a formulation of curcumin with high drug loading and improved stability, representing a good strategy for the delivery of this drug...|$|R
40|$|Aim: Water insolubility, low potency, and {{instability}} are inherent problems of several herbal medicines. Identity, strength, quality, and purity of herbal products are further compromised during manufacturing and storage. The aim of present work was to evaluate solubility {{and stability of}} curcumin, a pigment obtained from dried rhizomes of plant Cucrcuma longa. Materials and Methods: The stoichiometric ratios for inclusion complexation of curcumin with various cyclodextrins (CDs) were determined by phase solubility analysis. Grinding, kneading, and freeze-drying were employed to determine optimum complexation. Complexes were evaluated for drug inclusion, solubility, and stability. Results: Stability constants were 11200 M− 1, 1557 M− 1, 2858 M− 1, and 2206 M− 1 for α-, β-, γ-CD, and dimethyl β-CD (DIMEB), respectively, thus indicating good complex formation. Theoretical amounts of curcumin in binary products were between 80 % and 97 % with a maximum of 96. 8 % in curcumin-β-CD freeze-dried product. The complexation resulted in a marked improvement in the solubility of curcumin up to 60, 55, 56, and 1500 folds by α-, β-, γ-CD, and DIMEB, respectively. Inclusion complexation protected the drug from <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradations</b> as only 20 - 40 % degradation was observed {{at the end of}} 8 h as opposed to > 70 % for pure curcumin. Conclusion: A significant improvement in the solubility and stability was observed with curcumin-CD complex as compared to pure curcumin...|$|R
50|$|Aliphatic polyesters are {{a diverse}} family of {{synthetic}} polymers {{of which are}} biocompatible, biodegradable, and non-toxic. Specifically, poly (lactic acid) has low melt strength and low viscosity properties {{that are similar to}} EVA midsoles in athletic shoes. Poly (lactic acid) (PLA) is part of the poly (amide-enamine) group and can go through thermoplastic and foaming processes. Along with its good mechanical properties, its popularity is based on the non-toxic products that it becomes when it decomposes through <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation.</b> <b>Hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of PLA generates the monomer lactic acid, which is metabolized via the tri-carboxylic acid cycle and eliminated as carbon dioxide.|$|E
50|$|Together with methacrylic acid, bis-HPPP is {{released}} following the CE-catalyzed hydrolysis of 2,2-3-methacryloxypropoxy)-phenylpropane (bis-GMA). This reaction {{is very common}} in <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of the dental resin since salivary esterases are able to cleave the ester bonds in acrylic polymers of dental composites.|$|E
50|$|PET polymer is very {{sensitive}} to <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation,</b> resulting in severe reduction in its molecular weight, thereby adversely affecting its subsequent melt processability.

40|$|The {{sustained}} release of alprenolol, a ß-adrenergic antagonist, could {{be beneficial for}} the treatment of various heart diseases while reducing the side effects resulting from its continuous use. The novel and branched copolymers uniquely composed of biodegradable components (lactide and glycolide) have been synthesized using natural and therapeutically-efficient ß-aescin-initiator, and consequently characterized to determine their structures and physicochemical properties. The obtained matrices were not cyto- and genotoxic towards bacterial luminescence, protozoan, and Salmonella typhimurium TA 1535. The copolymers release the drug in vitro in a sustained manner and without burst release. The value of the drug released was strongly dependent on the copolymer composition and highly correlated with the <b>hydrolytic</b> matrices’ <b>degradation</b> results...|$|R

In {{agreement with the}} conclusions from related studies of ABS/PC blends, it appears that catalytic impurities in the ABS accentuate the propensity of PET for chain scission. Due to the cocontinuous structure of the blend, the <b>hydrolytic</b> or thermomechanical <b>degradation</b> of the PET results in a dramatic loss in mechanical properties which {{can be explained by}} the entanglement theory for fracture and the Orowan brittle-ductile hypothesis...|$|R

50|$|Ethion {{remains a}} major {{contaminant}} {{of the environment}} in among others Australia because of (former) usage in agriculture. However, there are some microbes that can convert ethion. The Pseudomonas and Azospirillum species were able to digest ethion when cultivated in minimal salts medium. A significant decrease of the Ethion concentration was observed. On top of that, ethion was the only available source of carbon. After analysis of the compounds present in the media after digestion of ethion through bacteria, {{it turned out that}} no abiotic <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> products of Ethion (like ethion dioxon and ethion monoxon) were present. The biodigestion of ethion is probably used to support rapid growth.|$|E
5000|$|The {{erosion and}} {{degradation}} of a polymer describe how the polymer physically loses mass (degrades). The two common erosion mechanisms are surface and bulk erosion. Polyanhydrides are surface eroding polymers. Surface eroding polymers {{do not allow}} water to penetrate into the material. They erode layer by layer, like a lollipop. The hydrophobic backbone with hydrolytically labile anhydride linkages allows <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> {{to be controlled by}} manipulating the polymer composition. This manipulation can occur by adding a hydrophilic group to the polyanhydride to make a copolymer. Polyanhydride copolymers with hydrophilic groups exhibit bulk eroding characteristics. Bulk eroding polymers take in water like a sponge (throughout the material) and erode inside and {{on the surface of the}} polymer.|$|E
40|$|Novel poly(ester–ether) s {{based on}} poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) as the hard {{segments}} and 30 mass % of poly(propylene oxide) (PPO) as the soft segments were synthesized with varying {{amount of the}} antioxidant (N,N'-diphenyl-p-phenylenediamine, DPPD). The influences of the addition of DPPD {{and the impact of}} post-synthetic treatment by precipitation on the molecular structure, thermal and physical properties, {{as well as on the}} storage stability of the biodegradable aliphatic copolyesters, were investigated. The structure and composition of the copolymers were determined by means of 1 H-NMR spectroscopy. The molecular weight and polydispersity of the poly(ester–ether) s were evaluated from solution viscosity and GPC measurements. The thermal properties and stability were evaluated, respecttively, by means of DSC and non-isothermal thermogravimetry in an inert nitrogen atmosphere. The biodegradability potential of the polymers was studied in <b>hydrolytic</b> and enzymatic <b>degradation</b> tests with Candida cylindracea lipase by monitoring the weight loss of polymer films after incubation. The weight losses of the samples increased with time and were in the range from 1 to 5 mass % after 4 weeks. GPC analysis confirmed that there were changes in the molecular weight of the copolyesters during both <b>hydrolytic</b> and enzymatic <b>degradation</b> tests, leading to the conclusion that the degradation mechanism of poly(butylenes succinate) modified with PPO occurred through surface erosion and bulk degradation...|$|R

Scaffolds with a different molar ratio between PAHy repeating units and HA repeating units have been prepared and characterized from a chemical and physicochemical point of view.

The availability of autologous grafts is limited and artificial grafts tend to fail {{when applied to}} small calibre vessels (<; 6 mm) due to graft thrombosis and mechanical mismatch between artery and graft. Tissue engineering offers a promising approach to overcome these shortcomings. With porosity as a fundamental prerequisite for tissue ingrowth, several techniques have been introduced for producing porous scaffolds including electro-spinning. This study involved the development and optimisation of electro-spun biodegradable scaffolds for vascular tissue regeneration by tailoring parameters of the electro-spinning process and investigating the change in mechanical and physical properties of the scaffolds associated with <b>hydrolytic</b> in vitro <b>degradation...</b>|$|R
50|$|Bacteria {{communicate}} {{among themselves}} and with other living forms in their environment via nano-scale membrane vesicles in their bacterial outer membranes. These vesicles are involved in trafficking bacterial cell signaling biochemicals, which may include DNA, RNA, proteins, endotoxins and allied virulence molecules. This communication happens in microbial cultures to oceans, inside animal/plant hosts and wherever bacteria may thrive. Gram negative microorganisms deploy their periplasm to secrete bacterial outer membrane vesicles (OMVs) for trafficking bacterial biochemicals to target cells in their environment (Fig. 1); OMVs also carry endotoxic lipopolysaccharide initiating disease process in their host. This mechanism imparts a variety of benefits like, long-distance delivery of bacterial secretory cargo with minimized <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> and extra-cellular dilution, also supplemented with other supportive molecules (e.g., virulence factors) to accomplish a specific job and yet, keeping a safe-distance from the defense arsenal of the targeted cells. Biochemical signals trafficked by OMVs may vary largely during 'war and peace' situations. In 'complacent' bacterial colonies, OMVs {{may be used to}} carry DNA to 'related' microbes for genetic transformations, and also translocate cell signaling molecules for quorum sensing and biofilm formation. During 'challenge' from other cell types around, OMVs may be preferred to carry degradation and subversion enzymes. Likewise, OMVs may contain more of invasion proteins at the host-pathogen interface (Fig. 1). It is expected, that environmental factors around the secretory microbes are responsible for inducing these bacteria to synthesize and secrete specifically-enriched OMVs, physiologically suiting the immediate task. Thus, bacterial OMVs, being strong immunomodulators, can be manipulated for their immunogenic contents and utilized as potent pathogen-free vaccines for immunizing humans and animals against threatening infections.|$|E
40|$|Objective: To {{investigate}} the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of the kinetic characteristics of Potassium Dehydroandrographolidi Succinas (DAS-K) in aqueous solution. Methods: The HPLC method {{was used to}} determine the degradation kinetic parameters of DAS-K aqueous solution at different initial concentration, different pH, different ionic strength, various temperatures and in different buffer solutions. Results: DAS-K <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> followed first-order kinetics as measured by HPLC. From pH 8, the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> rate of DAS-K markedly increased with pH. DAS-K was unstable in alkaline pH solution. The species of buffer solutions seem to have different impact on the catalytic process. The ionic strength did not have significant effect on the stability of the drug. According to the Arrhenius plot, the dependence of the decomposition on temperature was a determining factor, the activation energy was estimated to be 95. 68 KJ/mol in phosphate buffer solution at pH 8 and temperature from 60 to 90 °C. Conclusion: It was found that the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of DAS-K complied with first-order kinetics. The rate of <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of DAS-K depended on the pH of solution, the buffer concentration, the buffer species and the temperature. Especially, pH value was an important factor in determining the rate of the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of the drug. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|E
40|$|In this work, silane {{crosslinking}} of poly (lactic acid) (PLA) was studied. PLA was {{grafted with}} vinyl-trimethoxysilane (VTMO) via melt mixing in an internal mixer, {{followed by a}} crosslinking reaction in hot water for different times. The effect of simultaneous <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> in hot water (70 °C) during crosslinking was monitored. Silane grafting of PLA was characterized using mixing torque and gel permeation chromatography (GPC) analysis. The results revealed that by increasing the silane (0 – 7 wt%) and peroxide (0 – 0. 5 wt%) contents, the degree of grafting was increased. A peak corresponding to higher molecular weight in GPC chromatograms appeared in comparison to pure PLA due to the grafting reaction. Gel content, swelling test, GPC and thermal gravimetric analysis (TGA) were performed to monitor gel structure and concurrent <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation.</b> Results confirmed that the occurrence of <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> during crosslinking and gel content of some samples tended to zero over 10 hr of immersion in hot water. The effect of <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> was not significant up to 10 hr and a tight gel structure was obtained. However, at longer crosslinking times, <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> was the dominant mechanism that leads to network defects...|$|E

Repeated irradiation and subsequent re-conditioning cycles did result in a significant decrease in the concentration of the TBP and CMPO extractants in the TRUEX solvent and a corresponding decrease in americium and europium extraction distributions. However, the build-up of solvent degradation products upon {gamma}-irradiation, had little impact upon the efficiency of the stripping section of the TRUEX flowsheet. Operation of the TRUEX flowsheet would require careful monitoring to ensure extraction distributions are maintained at acceptable levels...|$|R

40|$|AbstractThis paper {{reports the}} {{development}} of a new method for quantification of the <b>hydrolytic</b> surface <b>degradation</b> kinetics of biodegradable poly(α-hydroxy acid) s using time-of-flight secondary ion mass spectrometry (TOF-SIMS). We report results from static SIMS spectra of a series of poly(α-hydroxy acid) s including poly(glycolic acid), poly(L-lactic acid), and random poly(D,L-lactic acid-co-glycolic acid) hydrolyzed in various buffer systems. The distribution of the most intense peak intensities of ions generated in high mass range of the spectrum reflects the intact degradation products (oligomeric hydrolysis products) of each biodegradable polymer. First, a detailed analysis of the oligomeric ions is given based on rearrangement of the intact hydrolysis products. The pattern of ions can distinguish both degradation-generated intact oligomers and their fragment ion peaks with a variety of combinations of each repeat unit. Then, the integration and summation of the area of all ion peaks with the same number of repeat units is proposed as a measurement that provides a more accurate MW average than the typically used method which counts only the most intense peak. The multiple ion summation method described in this paper would be practical in the improvement of quantitative TOF-SIMS studies as a better data reduction method, especially in the surface degradation kinetics of biodegradable polymers...|$|R

Henry's constant for NO dissolved in water-dimethylsulfoxide (DMSO) (1 : 1) solution has been measured. The temperature dependence of <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> rate constant of complex 1 has been determined. High enough rates of the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of these complexes at high negative entropy of activation {{can be explained by}} the low value of activation energy...|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this work}} was to use the HPSEC {{analysis}} of polar compounds to assess the level of oxidative and <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of the lipid fraction of mortadella. The results indicated high primary oxidative degradation of the lipid fraction in the samples, with a mean value for oxidized triacylglycerols of 1. 77 %, and low secondary oxidation, with a mean value for triacylglycerol oligopolymers of 0. 16 %. In addition, in some cases, significant <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> was found. HPSEC analysis of polar compounds, to evaluate the level of oxidative and <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of the mortadella lipid fraction, {{could be used as}} an alternative to commonly used techniques, some of which are not always reliable...|$|E
40|$|Copolyesters of {{glycolic acid}} (G) {{combined}} with sebacic acid (S) and ethylene glycol were synthesized in different molar ratios (G: 0 - 100 % and S: 100 - 0 %) and their <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> was studied and correlated with their structures. Based on the FTIR spectra of the homopolyesters and copolyesters and the normalized peak {{intensity of the}} I 2918, I 2848 and I 1087 for the corresponding wavenumbers, it is concluded that the I 2918 and the I 2848 are {{in accordance with the}} mean number degree of polymerization of ethylene sebacate units and the I 1087 is in accordance with the mean number degree of polymerization of glycolate units. Based on the XRD diffractograms, poly(ethylene sebacate) and poly(glycolic acid) belong to the monoclinic and the orthorhombic crystal system, respectively and both have higher crystallinity than the copolyesters. The experimental data of the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> were fitted with exponential rise to maximum type functions using two-parameter model and four-parameter model. Three regions can been distinguished for the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> by decreasing the molar feed ratio of sebacic acid, which are correlated with the changes of crystallinity. Two copolyesters are proposed: first the copolyester with high amount of glycolate units (S 10 G 90) having higher <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> than G 100 and second the copolyester with equal amount of glycolate and ethylene sebacate units (S 50 G 50), having lower <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> than G 100.

40|$|The intraocular {{degradation}} {{behavior of}} poly(trimethylene carbonate) (PTMC) networks and poly(-D,L-lactic acid) (PDLLA) networks and of linear {{high molecular weight}} PTMC and PDLLA was evaluated. PTMC is known to degrade by enzymatic surface erosion in vivo, whereas PDLLA degrades by <b>hydrolytic</b> bulk <b>degradation.</b> Rod shaped specimens were implanted in the vitreous of New Zealand white rabbits for 6 or 13 wk. All materials were well tolerated in the rabbit vitreous. The degradation of linear high molecular weight PTMC and PTMC networks was very slow and no significant mass loss was observed within 13 wk. Only some minor signs of macrophage mediated erosion were found. The fact that no significant enzymatic surface erosion occurs {{can be related to}} the avascularity of the vitreous and the limited number of cells it contains. PDLLA samples showed more evident signs of degradation. For linear PDLLA significant swelling and a large decrease in molecular weight in time was observed and PDLLA network implants started to lose mass within 13 wk. Of the tested materials, PDLLA networks seem to be most promising for long term degradation controlled intravitreal drug delivery since this material degrades without significant swelling. Furthermore the preparation method of these networks allows easy and efficient incorporation of drugs. (C) 2011 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

By means of these electrochemical techniques, the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of CP was successfully followed. The pH effect on this degradation was also investigated. In darkness, the decrease in the peak current of CP was not practically observed at the acidic and physiological pHs (2. 5, 5. 0 and 7. 4). But, in the basic medium (pH 9. 0 and 11. 0), a decrease in the peak current was detected. On the other hand, UV irradiation caused a decrease in the peak current of CP and a positive shift in its cathodic peak potential. Under the UV irradiation, the maximum stability of CP was observed in B-R buffer of pH 5. It has been determined that UV irradiation has a great effect on <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of CP at basic medium. On the other hand, at pHs  7. 4, a new peak has been also obtained at more positive potential than that of the first reduction peak of CP. The current of this peak increases by increasing UV irradiation time.

Hydrolysis of each drug were carried out in ethanol/Britton-Robinson buffer at different pHs, stored into amber vials at controlled temperatures of 40, 60 and 80 degreesC and periodically sampled and assayed by HPLC. Nitrendipine degradation in different parenteral solutions was also evaluated. The HPLC procedure exhibited an adequate selectivity, repeatability (pH 8) with a first order kinetic for both drugs. At pH 12, 80 degreesC, k values of 3. 56 x 10 (- 2) h(- 1) and 2. 22 x 10 (- 2) for nitrendipine and nisoldipine, respectively were obtained.

40|$|The autocatalytic {{equation}} derived in {{this study}} describes and even predicts {{the evolution of the}} number average molecular weight of aliphatic polyesters upon <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation.</b> The main reaction in the degradation of aliphatic polyesters is autocatalytic hydrolysis of ester bonds, which causes the molecular weight to decrease. During hydrolysis of the ester bonds in the main chain of the polyester, the chains are cleaved and the end group concentrations will rise. The fundamentals of this equation are based on that principle. To validate the derived equation, the <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of poly(4 -methylcaprolactone), poly(e-caprolactone), poly(d,l-lactide), and two different poly(d,l-lactide-co-glycolide) copolymers was monitored after immersion in a PBS buffer (pH = 7. 4) at 37 °C. The number average molecular weight, mass loss, and crystallinity were determined after different time intervals. The experimental results confirm that <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> of aliphatic polyesters is a bulk erosion process. When comparing the Mn, calculated with the new autocatalytic equation, with the experimental results, {{it was found that the}} new model can predict the decrease of the Mn upon <b>hydrolytic</b> <b>degradation</b> for semicrystalline and amorphous polymers, as well as for copolymers, without the need for complicated mathematics and excessive input parameters.

40|$|The biosynthetic {{origin of}} the dichloroimine {{functional}} group in the marine sponge terpene metabolites stylotellanes A (3) and B (4) was probed {{by the use of}} [C- 14]-labelled precursor experiments. Incubation of the sponge Stylotella aurantium with [C- 14]-labelled cyanide or thiocyanate resulted in radioactive terpenes in which the radiolabel was shown by <b>hydrolytic</b> chemical <b>degradation</b> to be associated specifically with the dichloroimine carbons. Additionally, label from both precursors was incorporated into farnesyl isothiocyanate (2). A time course experiment with [14 C]cyanide revealed that the specific activity for farnesyl isothiocyanate decreases over time, but increases for stylotellane B (4), consistent with the rapid formation of farnesyl isothiocyanate (2) from inorganic precursors followed by a slower conversion to stylotellane B (4). The advanced precursors farnesyl isothiocyanate (2) and farnesyl isocyanide (5) were supplied to S. aurantium, and shown to be incorporated efficiently into stylotellane A (3) and B (4). Feeding of [C- 14]-farnesyl isothiocyanate (2) resulted in a higher incorporation of label than with [C- 14]-farnesyl isocyanide (5). Farnesyl isocyanide was incorporated into farnesyl isothiocyanate in agreement with labelling studies in other marine sponges. Both farnesyl isocyanide and isothiocyanate were further incorporated into axinyssamide A (11) as well as the cyclized dichloroimines (12) -(14), (16) that represent more advanced biosynthetic products of this pathway. These results identify the likely biosynthetic pathway leading to the major metabolites of S. aurantium...|$|R
