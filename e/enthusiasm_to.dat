5|$|According to Michel Beluet, {{the former}} {{director}} of a Raëlian-built museum called UFOland, the only pressure exerted on members is to attend annual Raëlian seminars, which allows members convinced of Raël's <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> voluntarily tithe. Palmer cited Raël, who claimed that more than 60% of the Raëlian Movement's members do not tithe. Dawson College students conducted a survey of the membership in Canada 1991 which found that only one-third of respondents tithed.|$|E
5|$|O'Connell {{was born}} to {{distinguished}} lawyer Charles O'Connell in 1849 in Ennis, County Clare, Ireland, some {{two years after the}} death of his famed grand-uncle Daniel O'Connell. Young O'Connell attended Belvedere College, a Jesuit school in Dublin, but was called home at the deaths of his mother and sister in a coach accident. This tragic event was later judged to be the source of O'Connell's sense of the impermanence of the world. After the funeral, he was transferred without <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> Clongowes Wood College where he studied the classics for three years. O'Connell signed on with the Royal Navy as a midshipman. He travelled around Cape Horn to California in 1868.|$|E

The date goes well, but Theodore hesitates to promise when he will see her again, so she insults him and leaves. Theodore {{mentions}} this to Samantha, and they talk about relationships. Theodore explains that, although he and Amy (Amy Adams) dated briefly in college, they are only good friends, and that Amy is married. Theodore and Samantha's intimacy grows through a verbal sexual encounter. They develop a relationship that reflects positively in Theodore's writing and well-being, and in Samantha's <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> grow and learn.|$|E

25|$|The Cane Beetles March was {{a snowball}} march in April 1916 in North Queensland, Australia, to recruit men into the Australian Imperial Force during World War I {{at a time}} when <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> enlist had waned after the loss of life in the Gallipoli campaign.

25|$|Michigan's economy {{underwent}} a transformation {{at the turn}} of the 20th century. Many individuals, including Ransom E. Olds, John and Horace Dodge, Henry Leland, David Dunbar Buick, Henry Joy, Charles King, and Henry Ford, provided the concentration of engineering know-how and technological <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> start the birth of the automotive industry. Ford's development of the moving assembly line in Highland Park marked the beginning of a new era in transportation. Like the steamship and railroad, it was a far-reaching development. More than the forms of public transportation, the automobile transformed private life. It became the major industry of Detroit and Michigan, and permanently altered the socio-economic life of the United States and much of the world.|$|E

25|$|To ensure {{against a}} student uprising, the {{president}} combined {{the two major}} youth organizations in Dahomey, chapters of the World Federation of Youth and the World Federation of Democratic Youth, into the National Union of Dahomeyan Youth. It was to remain a nationally run organization, unaffiliated with any international institution. Nonetheless, he would do nothing more than reprimand students who protested him, not even revoke their scholarships. On December 31, 1961 the Maga administration raised certain taxes, including those on income, transportation, and permits {{in an attempt to}} balance his country's budget. He nonetheless ran into trouble in the enforcement of his plan. Throughout his first term as president, Maga toured various parts of Dahomey to bring <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> his plan, offering undeveloped land to its supporters.|$|E

After the President and his entourage had been welcomed aboard, Savannah departed under steam around 8 a.m. for Tybee Lighthouse, arriving there at 10:30a.m., and departing for town again at 11. Monroe dined on board, expressing <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> the ship's owner, Mr. Scarborough, over {{the prospect of an}} American vessel inaugurating the world's first transatlantic steamship service. The President was also greatly impressed by Savannahs machinery, and invited Scarborough to bring the ship to Washington after her transatlantic crossing so that Congress could inspect the vessel with a view to purchasing her for use as a cruiser against Cuban pirates.|$|E
25|$|It {{was widely}} felt that Delhi's lack of <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> host {{the event was}} {{the primary reason for}} its loss. Then Union Sports Minister of India, Mani Shankar Aiyar, spoke {{strongly}} against Delhi hosting the games and argued that it was better if the money allocated by India's government for organizing the sporting event was spent on building facilities for the poor. The Indian Olympic Association (IOA) president revealed that India's Sports Minister remarks against hosting the Games was the main reason for New Delhi's loss. The IOA delegation also added that the bids evaluation committee was concerned about pollution and traffic in Delhi. Delhi offering US$200,000 to each team for games support against Incheon's offer of US$20 million to all 45 nations participating in the event could also have contributed to the defeat.|$|E

25|$|By the mid 19th century {{there was}} much <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> rebuild the church in a Victorian Gothic style. A new {{building}} would {{also serve as a}} memorial to the former Vicar Rev. Henry Lonsdale, brother of Bishop Lonsdale who died in 1851 and was buried beneath the west tower. In 1853 the tower was lowered and remodelled in a Victorian Gothic style, complete with steeple under a design by George Edmund Street. The architect also submitted a design for {{the main body of the}} church, but due to lack of funds rebuilding of the main church did not commence until 1868. For the last 15 years of the neoclassical style church it consisted of a gothic tower with spire and neoclassical style main body encased in stucco, the body of the church was demolished in 1868 after standing for 147 years.|$|E
25|$|Beginning in the 1890s, C {{land agent}} Carl M. Bergh, a Norwegian-American who had earlier farmed in the mid-western states, {{realized}} that the gentler climate of eastern Virginia and depressed post-Civil War land prices would be attractive to his fellow Scandinavians who were farming in other northern parts of the country. He began sending out notices, and selling land. Soon there was a substantial concentration of relocated Americans of Norwegian, Swedish, and Danish descent in the area. The location earlier known as Vaiden's Siding on the railroad just west of Williamsburg in James City County, was renamed Norge. These citizens and their descendants found the area conditions favorable as described by Bergh, and many became leading merchants, tradespersons, and farmers in the community. These transplanted Americans brought some new blood and <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> the old colonial capitol area.|$|E
25|$|Isaac Titsingh can be {{described}} as being the only philosophique employed by the VOC in its almost two hundred years existence and the most sophisticated of all VOC employees in the trading post history of the VOC in Japan (1600-1853). Due to his extensive private correspondence on religious as well as human topics and his endeavours in the exchanges between the outside world and his own, he can be considered as a true philosopher of the 18th century. Compared to the other VOC employees he was a polyglot, who spoke eight languages (Dutch, Latin, French, English, German, Portuguese, Japanese and Chinese). His <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> introduce the European society to Japanese customs and culture was rooted in his overall passion for Japan and everything Japanese. Therefore, he became a prominent figure, transmitter and interpreter in a two-way cultural, learning and knowledge exchange between the Japanese and the Europeans. For example, he imported Dutch books on European knowledge to Japan. In addition, he collected authentic source materials on Japan, which consisted of the first ever European collection on Japan, entailing printed books, manuscripts, prints, maps, city plans and coins. This collection was thus to form the basis of a then unique history of Japan.|$|E

25|$|With the {{exception}} of a Preface to the Sermons of Dr Whichcote, one of the Cambridge Platonists or latitudinarians, published in 1698, Shaftesbury appears to have printed nothing himself till 1708. About this time the French Camisards attracted much attention. The Camisard revolts against the persecution of their Protestant religion were being severely repressed by the royal forces. In this context, Shaftesbury maintained that fanaticism was best defeated by raillery and good-humour. In support of this view he wrote a letter Concerning <b>Enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> Lord Somers, dated September 1707, which was published anonymously in the following year, and provoked several replies. In May 1709, he returned to the subject, and printed another letter, entitled , an Essay on the Freedom of Wit and Humour. In the same year he also published The Moralists, a Philosophical Rhapsody, and in the following year Soliloquy, or Advice to an Author. None of these pieces seems to have been printed either with his name or his initials. In 1711, the Characteristics of Men, Manners, Opinions, Times appeared in three volumes, also without any name or initials on the title-page, and without even the name of a printer. These volumes contain in addition to the four treatises already mentioned, Miscellaneous Reflections, now first printed, and the Inquiry concerning Virtue and Merit, described as formerly printed from an imperfect copy, now corrected and published intire, and as printed first in 1699.|$|E
25|$|Due to the {{importance}} of the Dutch Baltic trade for Amsterdam and the northern Holland port cities, the Dutch were always keenly interested in what happened around the Sound. Already in the 1640s the Republic had intervened in the Torstenson War of king Christian IV of Denmark with Sweden, putting its thumb in the scales, both by military intervention in favor of the Swedes, and by favoring that country in the subsequent peace mediation that resulted in the Treaty of Brömsebro. Denmark had made itself unpopular in Dutch eyes by siding with Spain in the war and by unilaterally increasing the toll on Dutch shipping. At first there was little the Dutch could do, but when Christian provoked the Swedes to invade Jutland in 1643, the Dutch applauded, but did little more than offer diplomatic support, because the Zeeland and Rotterdam interests were loth to spend good money to defend the Amsterdam interests (the Orangists still being in the ascendant in this period). When the Swedes in consequence showed little <b>enthusiasm</b> <b>to</b> help lower tolls for the Dutch in the peace negotiations of 1644, the States General were finally forced to put their money where their mouth was. A Dutch fleet of 48 warships was assembled that in July, 1645, escorted three hundred Dutch merchant vessels through the Sound, making a show of not paying any toll at all. The Danish monarch watched the imposing spectacle in person from the ramparts of the castle of Helsingør, being politely saluted by the Dutch. The king made no response. A few months later a treaty was signed with the Dutch that formed the basis for their commercial ascendancy throughout the 17th century in the Baltic trade. Tolls for the Dutch were lowered; Dutch shipping would be exempt from visitation by Danish officials; Dutch shipping would be totally exempt from the toll at Glückstadt.|$|E
