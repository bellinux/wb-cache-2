40|$|Charge carrier mobilities {{of organic}} {{semiconductors}} are often characterized using steady-state measurements of space charge limited diodes. These measurements assume that charge carriers {{are in a}} steady-state equilibrium. In reality, however, energetically <b>hot</b> <b>carriers</b> are introduces by photo-excitation and injection into highly energetic sites from the electrodes. These carriers perturb the equilibrium density of occupied states, and therefore change the overall charge transport properties. In this paper, we look into the effect of energetically <b>hot</b> <b>carriers</b> on the charge transport in organic semiconductors using steady state kinetic Monte Carlo simulations. For injected <b>hot</b> <b>carriers</b> in a typical organic semiconductor, rapid energetic relaxation occurs {{in the order of}} tens of nanoseconds, which is much faster than the typical transit time of a charge carrier throught the device. Furthermore, we investigate the impact of photo-generated carriers on the steady-state mobility. For a typical organic voltaic material, an increase in mobility of a factor of 1. 1 is found. Therefore, we conclude that the impact of energetically <b>hot</b> <b>carriers</b> on normal device operation is limited...|$|R

5000|$|Total {{ionizing}} dose effects: The {{cumulative damage}} of the semiconductor lattice (lattice displacement damage) caused by ionizing radiation over the exposition time. It {{is measured in}} rads and causes slow gradual degradation of the device's performance. A total dose greater than 5000 rads delivered to silicon-based devices in seconds to minutes will cause long-term degradation. In CMOS devices, the radiation creates electron-hole pairs in the gate insulation layers, which cause photocurrents during their recombination, and the holes trapped in the lattice defects in the insulator create a persistent gate biasing and influence the transistors' threshold voltage, making the N-type MOSFET transistors easier and the P-type ones more difficult to switch on. The accumulated charge can be high {{enough to keep the}} transistors permanently open (or closed), leading to device failure. Some self-healing takes place over time, but this effect is not too significant. This effect is the same as <b>hot</b> <b>carrier</b> degradation in high-integration high-speed electronics.
