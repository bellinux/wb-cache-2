40|$|This paper {{develops}} a criterion to assess <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity {{that is consistent}} with theoretical views of equality of opportunity. We characterize inequality of opportunity as a situation where some groups in society enjoy an illegitimate advantage. In this context, <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity requires that the extent of the illegitimate advantage enjoyed by the privileged groups falls. Robustness requires that this judgement be supported by the broadest class of individual preferences. We formalize this criterion in a decision theoretic framework, and derive an empirical condition for <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> opportunity based on observed opportunity distributions. The criterion is used to assess the effectiveness of child care at equalizing opportunity among children, using quantile treatment effects estimates of a major child care reform in Norway...|$|R

60|$|For these reasons, <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> wealth without <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> power {{seems to}} me a rather small and {{unstable}} achievement. But <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> power is not a thing that can be achieved in a day. It requires a considerable level of moral, intellectual, and technical education. It requires a long period without extreme crises, in order that habits of tolerance and good nature may become common. It requires vigour {{on the part of those}} who are acquiring power, without a too desperate resistance on the part of those whose share is diminishing. This is only possible if those who are acquiring power are not very fierce, and do not terrify their opponents by threats of ruin and death. It cannot be done quickly, because quick methods require that very mechanism and subordination of the individual which we should struggle to prevent.|$|R
40|$|The study {{deals with}} Huerta de Soto’s thesis about the “mistaken {{doctrine}} of common law”, {{which is based}} on the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> depositum irregulare and mutuum contracts. He concluded that <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> these contracts resulted in the creation of business cycles. According to this study, Huerta de Soto made a mistake when considering contracts inspired by the continental law based on Roman law. The study shows that mutuum was even in Roman law an ancient contract that was not codified, and that Huerta de Soto’s interpretation of this contract in the Anglo-American legal system is based more on civil law, not on common law as he stated in his work. Finally, the problem of common law did not lie in the <b>equalization</b> <b>of</b> the mentioned contracts, but rather in the absence of depositum irregulare contracts applied to monetary questions...|$|R
