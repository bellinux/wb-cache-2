Eurogamer called XIII [...] "a flawed masterpiece. A game brimming with variety and a freshness lacking {{from most of the}} factory farmed franchise exercises that pass through our offices with crushing regularity". Game Revolution complimented the game's story, graphical style, voice acting and soundtrack, while criticising the gameplay as [...] "about as straightforward – and in some cases boring – as it gets for an FPS". Electronic Gaming Monthly scored the game 6.5/6.5/6.5: Joe Fielder, the first reviewer, said, [...] "You'd be hard-pressed to find a more visually stunning game than XIII", but complained that [...] "numerous frustrations pile up to make XIII more chore than thrill". The magazine's Greg Ford, who provided the third review, said that its [...] "style, cut-scenes, and story are all great, [...] the actual gameplay is pretty mundane"; he concluded, [...] "But <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> need is a solid shooter fix, XIII will do just fine. It has no fatal flaws, and the conspiracy-laced story should keep you going".|$|E

The series's first champion Nelson Piquet Jr. (NextEV NIO) spoke of his excitement for the eRace and believed Formula E combining the worlds of simulation and real-life racing was a positive step: [...] "I think this is going to be really fun with all the drivers together." [...] Andretti driver Robin Frijns revealed his interest in how he would compare against sim drivers: [...] "I don’t really know what to expect, maybe the sim drivers or the fans are really good, maybe not, we don’t know. <b>If</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> do is race on simulators at home, then maybe they are pretty good!” Hans-Jürgen Abt, the team principal of Audi Sport ABT, felt the Vegas eRace was [...] "a good example" [...] of how the series was moving farther than several other sporting championships: [...] "For more than six decades, we have been racing in motorsport on all of the world’s race tracks – but this event is a total first for us." ...|$|E

60|$|Down in Bleeding Heart Yard, {{where there}} was not one {{unappropriated}} halfpenny, as lively an interest was taken in this paragon of men as on the Stock Exchange. Mrs Plornish, now established in the small grocery and general trade in a snug little shop at the crack end of the Yard, {{at the top of the}} steps, with her little old father and Maggy acting as assistants, habitually held forth about him over the counter in conversation with her customers. Mr Plornish, who had a small share in a small builder's business in the neighbourhood, said, trowel in hand, on the tops of scaffolds and on the tiles of houses, that people did tell him as Mr Merdle was the one, mind you, to put us all to rights in respects of that which all on us looked to, and to bring us all safe home as much as we needed, mind you, fur toe be brought. Mr Baptist, sole lodger of Mr and Mrs Plornish was reputed in whispers to lay by the savings which were the result of his simple and moderate life, for investment in one of Mr Merdle's certain enterprises. The female Bleeding Hearts, when they came for ounces of tea, and hundredweights of talk, gave Mrs Plornish to understand, That how, ma'am, they had heard from their cousin Mary Anne, which worked in the line, that his lady's dresses would fill three waggons. That how she was as handsome a lady, ma'am, as lived, no matter wheres, and a busk like marble itself. That how, according to what they was told, ma'am, it was her son by a former husband as was took into the Government; and a General he had been, and armies he had marched again and victory crowned, <b>if</b> <b>all</b> <b>you</b> heard was to be believed. That how it was reported that Mr Merdle's words had been, that if they could have made it worth his while to take the whole Government he would have took it without a profit, but that take it he could not and stand a loss. That how it was not to be expected, ma'am, that he should lose by it, his ways being, as you might say and utter no falsehood, paved with gold; but that how it was much to be regretted that something handsome hadn't been got up to make it worth his while; for it was such and only such that knowed the heighth to which the bread and butchers' meat had rose, and it was such and only such that both could and would bring that heighth down.|$|E
