40|$|This thesis {{demonstrates}} {{the influence of}} guideway design on overall high speed maglev system performance characteristics and suggests methods for improved, high performance maglev guideway design. The research focuses on three areas: * advanced material design and application of a hybrid fiber reinforced plastic, FRP, non-magnetic concrete reinforcing rod · hollow-box, narrow beam reinforced concrete guideway design and analysis, using both steel and hybrid FRP reinforcement · dynamic beam analysis showing the interactions between beam length and frequency, and vehicle velocity and loading pad configuration Structural requirements for a maglev <b>guideway</b> <b>beam,</b> including criteria for geometry, loads, deflections, durability, toughness, fatigue, and magnetic inertness, are defined and developed. Proposed construction methods are analyzed to determine the impact that the choice of method has on both the cost and structural design of the guideway. A conceptual design follows in which candidate cross-sectional shapes an...|$|E
3000|$|INNOVIA Monorail 300 {{switches}} {{are either}} beam replacement or multi-position pivot switches. The beam replacement switches are {{used on the}} mainline and multi-position pivot switches are used in storage yard areas. In both cases, they are structural steel assemblies incorporating steel <b>guideway</b> <b>beams</b> that pivot to provide guidance and support, routing the train from one lane to another. Power rails are continuous throughout the switches to maintain vehicle propulsion.|$|R

By {{approving}} citizens Initiative 53, Seattle voters asked for an alternative to traffic congestion through a new, expanded monorail system that would speed travelers up and over the cars below. The Elevated Transportation Company was asked to plan the new monorail and develop a proposal to build it. This document, the ETC Seattle Popular Monorail Plan, is our response. In it, we call {{for the creation of a}} 5 -line, 58 -mile citywide monorail system, and present a detailed proposal for the first line to be built, the 14 -mile Green Line from Ballard and West Seattle to Downtown. The Plan includes a proposed route for the Green Line as well as cost, revenue, and ridership estimates, together with a proposal to fund Green Line construction and start-up. As we present this Plan today, we do so with great enthusiasm for the promise of monorail transportation in 21 st century Seattle. A monorail system will give us a fast, elevated alternative to traffic congestion, and seamless mobility between Downtown and the neighborhoods. It will be safe, separated from cars and pedestrians. And it will be good for the environment, with its nonpolluting electric cars running quietly along the <b>guideway</b> <b>beams.</b> Our work has undergone extensive public review and comment as well as rigorous technical analysis from independent experts. The Plan has been refined and strengthened over the months and we are confident that it not only proposes a viable and efficien...|$|R
5000|$|The Diesel/hydraulic powered [...] "work tractors" [...] are {{primarily}} used each morning for beam inspection and maintenance-of-way which includes trimming vegetation {{beyond the reach}} of guests, cleaning and repairing the electrical commutator rails as well as periodically scheduled servicing and painting of the concrete <b>beam</b> <b>guideway.</b> They are powerful enough to return a fully loaded train fitted with tow-bars to a station platform, then to the Monorail Shop, independent of 600V track power.|$|R
25|$|There is {{some debate}} over the best type of <b>guideway.</b> Proposals include <b>beams</b> similar to monorails, bridge-like trusses {{supporting}} internal tracks, and cables embedded in a roadway. Most designs put the vehicle {{on top of the}} track, which reduces visual intrusion and cost as well as easing ground-level installation. An overhead track is necessarily higher, but may also be narrower. Most designs use the guideway to distribute power and data communications, including to the vehicles. The Morgantown PRT failed its cost targets because of its steam-heated track, so most proposals plan to resist snow and ice in ways that should be less expensive. Masdar's system has been limited because it attempted to dedicate ground-level to PRT guideways. This led to unrealistically expensive buildings and roads.|$|R
