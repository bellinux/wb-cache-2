500|$|Cody {{said she}} wanted the film to speak to female {{empowerment}} and explore the complex relationships between best friends. [...] "(Director) Karyn Kusama and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> outspoken feminists", she said. [...] "We wanted to subvert the classic horror model of women being terrorized. I want to write roles that service women. I want to tell stories from a female perspective. I want to create good parts for actresses where they're not just accessories to men." [...] Addressing [...] "the male-dominated" [...] horror genre, Cody said [...] "a key reason for writing the film was {{to bring to the}} screen a new way of expressing the intensity of female bonds" [...] and that the adolescent female friendships she experienced were unparalleled in their intensity. She wanted to show the [...] "almost horrific" [...] aspect of such devotion and its relation to parasitism.|$|E

[...] "Soon you guys will hear a song I wrote called When I Was Your Man. I've never been this nervous. Can't explain it," [...] he tweeted. Philip Lawrence explained the inspiration of the song: [...] "I think Bruno and <b>I</b> <b>are</b> <b>both</b> huge fans of older music, like Billy Joel and Elton John. We always loved those moments where you can sit at the piano and emote. Those intimate moments when an artist is so naked and vulnerable; you can’t help but be drawn to it. We always wanted to find a stripped down song like that, which is how that song came to be. The subject matter was real life; Bruno had experienced that, so we tried to say it in the best and catchiest way we could." ...|$|E
