40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of the analysis of 10 years of information 1957 - 1966 on three phases [...] begin, peak and end bloom [...] of the purple common lilac (Syringa vulgaris L.) using data recorded at approximately 1, 000 locations throughout the Western Region of the United States. The pattern of geographical advance of the various bloom phases is determined by both a manual mapping procedure developed by the author and by standard statistical methods. Manually drawn <b>isophanes</b> for the various elevations for begin bloom phase are based entirely upon the first 5 years of record, 1957 - 1961. A Zones of Adjustment map to convert the 5 -year equal level maps to the 10 -year 1957 - 1966 normal is also manually drawn. Statistical analyses to ascertain the geographical pattern of advance were made for begin bloom phase for the 5 -year period and for all three bloom phases for the 10 -year period. Both the manual and statistical analyses indicate a very definite pattern of geographical advance of begin bloom phase of the lilac which is characterized by the Early Ridge. Statistical analyses of all three phases indicate a parallel geographical advance of the three phases with average regional time displacement of about 10 days from begin to peak bloom and 10 days between peak and end bloom. Only the eastern third of the Western Region corresponds closely with Hopkins 2 ̆ 7 Bioclimatic Law. A measure of temporal variation of dates of bloom for each of all three phases indicate a parallel geographical advance of the three phases with average regional time displacement of about 10 days from begin to peak bloom and 10 days between peak and end bloom. Only the eastern third of the Western Region corresponds closely with Hopkins 2 ̆ 7 Bioclimatic Law. A measure of temporal variation of dates of bloom {{for each of the three}} phases was determined by computing standard deviations for every station having at least 5 years of record. A map was drawn showing the temporal variability of begin bloom phase throughout the Western Region. Medians of standard deviations for stat ions within each state were also determined. Large differences in standard deviation prevail throughout the region with a general tendency for variability to be highest in the southeastern part of the region and lowest in northeastern areas. A comparison is made between the normal dates of occurrence of bloom phases and temperature data throughout the Western Region. This is achieved by comparing isophanal and isothermal charts and by statistical analysis of data at 360 stations where both phenological and temperature records are available. Comparison of isophanal patterns of equal-level isophanal maps and isotherms at given elevations (or pressure lvels) on given dates indicate very similar patterns; both are characterized by the Early Ridge. Statistical Analyses of mean begin bloom dates and monthly mean maximum and minimum temperatures indicate that about 90 percent of the variance of bloom dates can be accounted for by maximum and minimum temperature measurements...|$|R

40|$|Aims. To study {{influence}} of combined treatment with human insulin analogues (insulin aspart and insulin detemir) on glycemic control, insulin resistance {{and development of}} ischaemic heart disease (IHD) in patients with type 2 diabetes mellitus (T 2 DM) and frequent hypoglycemic events in comparison with that of human insulins (soluble and <b>isophane).</b> Materials and methods. 54 patients (mean age 61. 2 ± 0. 7) with T 2 DM and IHD participated in this study. All included patients experienced frequent mild and moderate hypoglycemic events (3 + episodes per week). We analyzed frequency and severity of hypoglycemia, parameters of glycemic and lipid metabolism, number of ischaemic episodes per day, duration and depth of ST depression, circadian index, incidence {{of different types of}} arrhythmia and conduction abnormalities as measured by Holter ECG monitoring. All patients were subdivided into two groups by random sampling: 21 patient (first group) carried on with human soluble insulin and <b>isophane</b> in an optimized basal-bolus regimen. In 33 patients, comprising second group, treatment was changed for combination of insulin aspart (NovoRapid®, Novo Nordisk, Denmark) and insulin detemir (Levemir®, Novo Nordisk, Denmark). Follow-up period was set to 6 months. Results. In patients with frequent hypoglycemic experience different types of arrhythmia and heart conduction abnormalities were observed in 75. 9 % of cases. Most patients had complex types of arrhythmic disorders (70. 4 %) with ventricular extrasystole being the most common one. Signs of myocardial ischaemia were registered in 48. 1 % of patients. After 6 months of follow-up patients from the second group demonstrated a statistically significant decrease in fasting and postprandial levels of glycemia (p= 0. 000001). Both groups also had a significantly lower rate of hypoglycemic events. Moreover, in the second group all episodes of hypoglycemia were mild and occurred only in 36. 4 % of cases. Additionally, after 6 months of treatment with human insulin analogues ventricular extrasystoles were registered only in 24. 2 % of patients, while rate and duration of ischaemic episodes dropped to 4. 25 ± 1. 51 (p= 0. 012, comparing with first group). Conclusion. Treatment with human insulin analogues NovoRapid® and Levemir® is associated with 1. 6 % decrease in HbA 1 c levels. Mild hypoglycemia was 72. 2 % less frequent, as compared with rates in the group on human soluble and <b>isophane</b> insulin, while moderate and severe hypoglycemic events were not observed at all.

40|$|Background: Attaining optimal glucose {{control in}} type 2 {{diabetes}} (T 2 DM) is essential to minimise complications, but difficult to achieve in practice with declining β-cell function in patients. Aim: To evaluate the efficacy and feasibility of a protocol-led, treat-to-target approach emphasising earlier oral hypoglycaemic agent (OHA) combination and insulin use to target basal and prandial glucose in primary care. Methods: T 2 DM patients aged 40 - 75 years, with glycosylated haemoglobin (HbA 1 C) 6. 4 - 10. 0 % on diet or oral monotherapy in 7 practices were asked {{to participate in a}} protocol-led, target-driven programme of care using early OHA and insulin therapy combinations to target basal and prandial glucose. Recruited patients were randomised to pre-specified algorithms with monthly therapy adjustment aiming for fasting plasma glucose values (FPG) < 6 mmol/L and 2 -hour post-prandial (PPG) < 8 mmol/L. <b>Isophane</b> or humalog insulin was added where glucose targets were not attained. All patients were reviewed at one year. Glucose, weight and cardiovascular (CVS) risk factor outcomes were measured and the feasibility, acceptability and safety of the programme evaluated with validated questionnaires. Results: 345 patients were studied. 60 participated in the glucose study and 285 received standard care. 65 % of recruited patients were male, with mean (SD) age 61. 0 (8. 2) years, BMI 29. 8 (5. 3) kg/m 2, HbA 1 C 7. 5 (0. 9) % and median (IQR) T 2 DM duration 3 (1 - 5) years. 41 completed the study. Glucose control was significantly improved in recruited compared to non-recruited patients with a mean overall 0. 8 % HbA 1 C reduction and 72 % patients achieving HbA 1 C < 7 % and 64 % < 6. 5 % at 1 year. Therapy use was also significantly increased with 50 % requiring 3 therapies, 30 % 2 and 10 % monotherapy. 24 (59 %) of recruited patients received <b>isophane</b> and 16 (39 %) humalog to achieve targets. Glucose optimisation was achieved without significant hypoglycaemia or adverse events and patient quality of life (QoL) and therapy satisfaction remained high. CVS risk was reduced in recruited patients. Conclusions: A more structured, target-driven approach to glucose optimisation can successfully achieve normoglycaemia in a selected primary care T 2 DM population without significant adverse events, hypoglycaemia. or QoL impairment in patients.

40|$|L ipohypertrophy is {{a common}} side ef-fect of {{subcutaneous}} insulin therapy,occurring in up to 50 % of patients with type 1 diabetes (1 – 3). It is generally held that absorption of insulin from such palpably abnormal sites is erratic, al-though the consequence thereof on glu-cose control has been considered controversial (1, 4, 5). Notably, a recent study using the continuous glucose mon-itoring system to monitor swings of blood glucose documented a significant correla-tion between the mean of daily differences of glucose and the severity of injection site lipohypertrophy (6). Few studies have in-vestigated insulin uptake from lipohyper-trophic tissue. Absorption of <b>isophane</b> (NPH) insulin, as determined by plasma free insulin, {{was found to be}} markedly defective at abnormal injection sites (7), and absorption of regular insulin (Ac-trapid) was delayed as determined by the clearance of 125 I-insulin (8).

Glycated haemoglobin A 1 (HbA 1 c), measured at the same time each year, fell from a mean (SD) of 15. 8 (4. 7) % to 9. 9 (2. 6) % over the three years. A similar degree of improvement was seen when newly diagnosed patients were excluded from the analysis. This improvement was associated with a rise in mean (SD) insulin dosage from 0. 89 (0. 29) U/kg/day to 1. 17 (0. 35) U/kg/day. Good control was achieved more easily in children who had been diabetic for less than two years and in those who were prepubertal (particularly boys).

40|$|When diet {{therapy is}} no longer {{effective}} in keeping the fasting plasma glucose level < 6 mmol l- 1, a basal insulin supplement from a long-acting insulin such as ultralente can be added instead of using a sulphonylurea or metformin. The dose of insulin required can be predicted from {{the level of the}} fasting plasma glucose and the degree of obesity, which provides an index of the accompanying insulin resistance. The risk of hypoglycaemia is minimal provided that the dose is adjusted according to the fasting plasma glucose concentration and the patient can continue a normal life-style without restrictions concerning exercise or the size of individual meals. If given in appropriate doses a basal insulin supplement does not induce marked weight gain and insulin therapy is equally appropriate in patients with insulin deficiency and insulin resistance. Maintaining near-normal glucose concentrations probably outweights a putative risk of hyperinsulinaemia. In more severely affected patients, such as those with sulphonylurea failure, soluble insulin to cover meals in addition to a basal insulin supplement is needed. At this stage it is usual to stop tablet therapy and treat patients with either a basal and prandial insulin regimen or with twice daily soluble and <b>isophane</b> mixtures. Nevertheless, in elderly patients in whom regular meals cannot be guaranteed, continuing with sulphonylurea therapy and adding a basal insulin supplement can be a safe and effective way of preventing hyperglycaemic symptoms...|$|E
