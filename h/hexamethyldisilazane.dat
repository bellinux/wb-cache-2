50|$|Early {{attempts}} to prepare tris(trimethylsilyl)amine from ammonia and trimethylchlorosilane (TMS-Cl) were unsuccessful even at temperatures of 500 °C {{and in the}} presence of the base pyridine. The reaction of ammonia and trimethylchlorosilane stops at the stage of the doubly silylated product bis(dimethylsilyl)amine (usually referred to as <b>hexamethyldisilazane,</b> HMDS).|$|E
50|$|Bis(trimethylsilyl)amine (also {{known as}} <b>hexamethyldisilazane,</b> or HMDS) is an {{organosilicon}} compound with the molecular formula (CH3)3Si2NH. The molecule is a derivative of ammonia with trimethylsilyl groups {{in place of}} two hydrogen atoms. This colorless liquid is a reagent and a precursor to bases that are popular in organic synthesis and organometallic chemistry.|$|E
5000|$|A common {{method to}} {{increase}} adhesion of photoresist on the silicon wafer surface {{is to treat}} the wafer with <b>Hexamethyldisilazane</b> (HMDS). A new silicon wafer has a polar surface and has some adsorbed water on the surface. The wafer can undergo a dehydration bake to remove adsorbed water, and followed by the HMDS treatment {{also known as the}} priming stage. HMDS can be dispensed in liquid form onto the wafer using a syringe while the wafer is attached to a vacuum chuck in a spin coater. HMDS can also be applied in gas form in the process known as the vapor prime. The HMDS promotes good photoresist-to-wafer adhesion because it ensures the wafer surface is hydrophobic. After HMDS treatment the silicon surface oxide becomes silated, leaving a non-polar surface. The pristine silicon (100) face has a surface energy value of 56.9 mN/m, which is reduced to a value of 44.1 mN/m after HMDS treatment The molecular formula for <b>hexamethyldisilazane</b> is C6H19NSi2.|$|E
50|$|To obtain DNA sequence, the DNA nanoballs are {{attached}} to a microarray flow cell (Figure 5). The flow cell is a 25 mm by 75 mm silicon wafer coated with silicon dioxide, titanium, <b>hexamethyldisilazane</b> (HMDS), and a photoresist material. The DNA nanoballs {{are added to the}} flow cell and selectively bind to the aminosilane in a highly ordered pattern, allowing a very high density of DNA nanoballs to be sequenced.|$|E
50|$|A silazane is any hydride {{of silicon}} and {{nitrogen}} having a straight or branched chain of silicon and nitrogen atoms joined by covalent bonds. By extension, {{the word is}} also used for any organic derivative of such compounds. They are analogous to siloxanes, with -NH- replacing -O-. Their individual name {{is dependent on the}} number of silicon atoms in the chemical structure. <b>Hexamethyldisilazane</b> contains two silicon atoms bonded to the nitrogen atom.The majority of silazanes are moisture sensitive.|$|E
50|$|If <b>hexamethyldisilazane</b> (HMDS) {{is used as}} a {{nitrogen}} source {{instead of}} ammonia, transamination takes place. The chlorine atoms liberated from the chlorosilane are tied to the trimethylsilyl groups of HMDS so that no chlorine-containing solid salts are formed. This procedure was used by Dow Corning to manufacture the hydridopolysilazane HPZ.Numerous additional procedures for the synthesis of Si-N based polymers have been described in the literature (for example a dehydrogenation coupling between Si-H and N-H or ring-opening polymerizations) but none are currently employed commercially.|$|E
50|$|Photolithography is {{a process}} in {{removing}} select portions of thin films used in microfabrication. Microfabrication is the production of parts on the micro- and nano- scale, typically {{on the surface of}} silicon wafers for the production of microelectromechanical systems (MEMS). Photolithography makes this process possible through the combined used of <b>hexamethyldisilazane</b> (HMDS), photoresist (positive or negative), a spin coater, photomask, an exposure system and other various chemicals. By carefully manipulating these factors it is possible to create nearly any geometry microstructure on the surface of a silicon wafer. The chemical interaction between all the different components and the surface of the silicon wafer makes photolithography an interesting chemistry problem. Current science has been able to create features on the surface of silicon wafers between 1 and 100 µm.|$|E
50|$|Silicon-nitrogen {{compounds}} with alternating silicon- ("sila") {{and nitrogen}} atoms ("aza") are designated as silazanes. Simple examples of silazanes are disilazane H3Si-NH-SiH3 and <b>hexamethyldisilazane</b> (H3C) 3Si-NH-Si(CH3)3. If only one silicon atom {{is bound to}} the nitrogen atom, the materials are known as silylamines or aminosilanes (for example triethylsilylamine (H5C2)3Si-NH2). If three silicon atoms are bound to each nitrogen atom, the materials are called silsesquiazanes. Small ring-shaped molecules with a basic network of Si-N are named cyclosilazanes (for example cyclotrisilazane H2Si-NH 3). In contrast to this, polysilazanes are silazane polymers consisting of both large chains and rings showing a range of molecular masses. A polymer with the general formula (CH3)3Si-NH-(CH3)2Si-NH n-Si(CH3)3 is designated as poly(dimethylsilazane). According to the IUPAC rules for the designation of linear organic polymers, the compound would actually be named polyaza(dimethylsilylene), {{and according to the}} preliminary rules for inorganic macromolecules catena-poly(dimethylsilicon)-m-aza. The labels normally used to describe the structure of silicones (M, D, T, and Q) are rarely employed for polysilazanes.|$|E
50|$|A key {{drawback}} to using a metallic magnesium anode is {{the tendency to}} form a passivating (non conducting) layer when recharging, blocking further charging (in contrast to lithium's behaviour); The passivating layers were thought to originate from decomposition of the electrolyte during magnesium ion reduction. Common counter ions such as perchlorate and tetrafluoroborate were found to contribute to passivation, as were some common polar aprotic solvents such as carbonates and nitriles. Grignard based ethereal electrolytes have been shown not to passivate; Magnesium organoborates also showed electroplating without passivation. The compound Mg(BPh2Bu2)2 {{was used in the}} first demonstrated rechargeable magnesium battery, its usefulness was limited by electrochemical oxidation. Other electrolytes researched include mixed grignard/aluminium trichloride compounds, borohydrides, phenolates, alkoxides, mixed magnesium chloride/aluminium chloride systems in THF, amido based complexes (e.g. based on <b>hexamethyldisilazane),</b> carborane salts, a Mg(BH4)(NH2) solid state electrolyte, and gel polymers containing Mg(AlCl2EtBu)2 in tetraglyme/PVDF. Fluorinated alkoxyborate anions have also been investigated as potential electrolyte counter ions (2017). For solvent based systems ethers have been generally used in research (2014).|$|E

The reaction is believed to take place through a consecutive series of intramolecular reactions in a cascade to first generate a highly reactive carbene intermediate 3 (a–i) from 1 -chloroacetylisatin and n-butyl lithium which is simultaneously trapped by <b>hexamethyldisilazane</b> before undergoing its in situ hydrolysis with methanol to initiate its concomitant cyclocondensation to produce 4 (a–i) in high yield and purity...|$|E

40|$|We {{report on}} the {{influence}} of the dielectric/organic interface properties on the electrical characteristics of field-effect transistors based on polyphenylenevinylene derivatives. Through a systematic investigation of the most common dielectric surface treatments, a direct correlation of their effect on the field-effect electrical parameters, such as charge carrier mobility, On/Off current ratio, threshold voltage, and current hysteresis, has been established. It is found that the presence of OH groups at the dielectric surface, already known to act as carrier traps for electrons, decreases the hole mobility whereas it does not substantially affect the other electrical characteristics. The treatment of silicon dioxide surfaces with gas phase molecules such as octadecyltrichlorosilane and <b>hexamethyldisilazane</b> leads to an improvement in hole mobility as well as to a decrease in current hysteresis. The effects of a dielectric polymer layer spin coated onto silicon dioxide substrates before deposition of the semiconductor polymer can be related not only to the OH groups density but also to the interaction between the dielectric and the semiconductor molecules. Specifically, the elimination of the OH groups produces the same effect observed with <b>hexamethyldisilazane.</b> The hole mobility values obtained with <b>hexamethyldisilazane</b> and polymer dielectrics are the highest reported to date for PPV-based field-effect transistors...|$|E
