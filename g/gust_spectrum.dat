2500|$|The {{retirement}} {{life of the}} wing spar of a transport category aeroplane type-certificated to the safe-life principle {{is based on a}} safety factor applied to data obtained from flight tests and information about properties of the spar material. [...] The life of 11,400 flights for the Viscount inner lower boom was based on safety factors of 3.5 for the ground-air-ground cycle and 5.0 for fatigue damage due to atmospheric gusts. These safety factors were typical for this class of aeroplane. [...] A 50% reduction of mean time to failure does not adequately explain why the inner lower boom in VH-RMQ should have failed before reaching its {{retirement life}}. In anticipation that the atmospheric <b>gust</b> <b>spectrum</b> in Australia may be more severe on the Viscount than the spectrum in some other climatic zones the <b>gust</b> <b>spectrum</b> was measured during 14,000 Viscount flights in Australia before 1961. [...] The Department of Civil Aviation accepted the Viscount retirement lives as compatible with the atmospheric <b>gust</b> <b>spectrum</b> these aircraft would encounter during operations in Australia.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} an {{analytical}} study of a system using stability derivatives determined in static wind tunnel tests of a 1 / 6 scale model of a popular, high wing, light airplane equipped with the gust alleviation system are reported. The longitudinal short period mode dynamics of the system are analyzed, and include the following: (1) root loci, (2) airplane frequency responses to vertical gusts, (3) power spectra of the airplane responses in a <b>gust</b> <b>spectrum,</b> (4) time history responses to vertical gusts, and (5) handling characteristics. The system reduces the airplane's normal acceleration response to vertical gusts while simultaneously increasing the pitching response and reducing the damping of the longitudinal short period mode. The normal acceleration response can be minimized by using the proper amount of static alleviation and a fast response system with a moderate amount of damping. The addition of a flap elevator interconnect or a pitch damper system further increases the alleviation while moderating the simultaneous increase in pitching response. The system provides direct lift control and may reduce the stick fixed longitudinal static stability...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the design of}} optimal constant gain output feedback based controllers for a nonlinear aeroelastic system. Controllers are designed for flutter suppression as well as gust-load alleviation. This controller architecture {{is one of the}} simplest, using direct feedback of the sensor outputs, but its performance is highly dependent on sensor selection and placement. Also, optimal design of such controllers require an accurate knowledge of the expected disturbance mode and <b>gust</b> <b>spectrum.</b> This paper presents results pertaining to the performance of SOF controllers for aeroelastic control (linear and nonlinear) and compares it to that of LQR and LQG controllers. Controllers are designed for various sensor placement. The gain and phase margins of the various controllers are also presented to understand the robustness characteristics. For optimal sensor placement and with knowledge of the disturbance, the constant gain output feedback controller performance and robustness was found to be equivalent to that of linear quadratic regulator and linear quadratic Gaussian controllers for the example considered. These controllers were also shown to be very easy to alter and combine with other controllers/filters for better overall system response...|$|E
40|$|A {{flexible}} aircraft {{or space}} structure with active control is typically modeled by a large-order state space {{system of equations}} in order to accurately represent the rigid and flexible body modes, unsteady aerodynamic forces, actuator dynamics and <b>gust</b> <b>spectra.</b> The control law of this multi-input/multi-output (MIMO) system is expected to satisfy multiple design requirements on the dynamic loads, responses, actuator deflection and rate limitations, as well as maintain certain stability margins, yet should be simple enough to be implemented on an onboard digital microprocessor. A software package for performing an analog or digital control law synthesis for such a system, using optimal control theory and constrained optimization techniques is described...|$|R

K. -Europe and Africa, representing some 427, 000 and lr. 95, 000 miles respectively, Comparison {{has been made}} of these results Prom aircraft operated by two airlines and, although the overall variations in gust frequency were found to be 'ihe usual ones with gust magnitude and altitude, there were differences between the <b>gust</b> <b>spectra</b> of the two aircraft due to their different mcdes of operation The reduction in turbulence encountered by the Hermes 4 during cruise was largely due to its having cruised at IL?- 13, 000 feet whilst the Hermes 4 -A cruised at g- 10, 000 feet, but the relatively gradual climb and descent of the Hermes &A enabled its pilots to avoid more gusts {{during the rest of the}} flights.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a formulation for synthesis of digital active control laws for aeroservoelastic systems, which are typically modeled by large order equations {{in order to}} accurately represent the rigid and flexible body modes, unsteady aerodynamic forces, actuator dynamics, and <b>gust</b> <b>spectra.</b> The control law is expected to satisfy multiple design requirements on the dynamic loads, responses, actuator deflection and rate limitations, as well as maintain certain stability margins, yet should be simple enough to be implemented by an onboard digital microprocessor. The synthesis procedure minimizes a linear quadratic Gaussian type cost function, by updating selected free parameters of the control law, while satisfying a set of inequality constraints on the design loads, responses and stability margins. A stable classical control law or an estimator based full or reduced order control law {{can be used as}} an initial design starting point. The gradients of the cost function and the constraints, with respect to the digital control law design variables are derived analytically, to facilitate rapid convergence. Selected design responses can be treated as constraints instead of lumping them into the cost function, in order to satisfy individual root-mean-square load and response limitations. Constraints are also imposed on the minimum singular value requirements for stability robustness improvement...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MEng (Civil Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2005. Previous {{studies on}} the solar chimney have shown that its {{structural}} integrity might be compromised by the occurrence of resonance. A structure may displace excessively when a load of the same frequency as a structural eigen-frequency is applied. The wind <b>gust</b> <b>spectrum</b> peaks near the solar chimneyâ€™s fundamental resonance frequency. This phenomenon poses a reliability threat, {{not only to the}} solar chimney, but also to all high-rise, slender structures. Structural dynamics describe the response of a structure to a varying load. The dynamic equation incorporates four terms that bind the factors responsible for resonance: kinetic energy, dissipated energy (damping), stiffness energy and input energy (loading). After a brief literature study on classical chimney design procedures, the study scrutinises each of these terms individually {{in the context of the}} solar chimney as designed to date. A dynamic analysis is undertaken with all the above-mentioned parameters as defined and estimated by the study. The results from the analysis show amplifications of approximately three times the static displacements. In load cases where the wind direction inverts along the height, higher eigen-modes are excited. However, the most severe dynamic amplification occurs at the fundamental eigen-mode. In the context of solar chimney research, this study brings valuable new insights regarding the dynamic behaviour of the chimney structure to the fore...|$|E
40|$|The paper {{presents}} a methodology for calculating the flight dynamic characteristics and gust response of highly flexible aircraft. The aeroelastic model {{is based on}} a geometrically-exact, nonlinear beam model coupled with large angle aerodynamic model. The gust response is calculated based on various gust models. It is shown that the calculated <b>gust</b> response <b>spectrum</b> as well as the RMS values can be very different for different models. For a high-aspect-ratio flying wing example the spanwise non-uniform gust model predicts much higher response as compared to a uniform gust model. I...|$|R
40|$|The fatigue {{properties}} of 2024 aluminum alloy {{under the influence}} of TWIST on the aviation load spectrum were studied. The aircraft load spectrum was simplified, and the fatigue life of the aircraft was predicted by theoretical analysis, MATLAB program simulation and fatigue was test, and the failure mechanism was observed. The results show that the predicted values of fatigue life are 163800, 158280 and 134249 respectively. Aircraft cruise loads during actual <b>gust</b> load <b>spectrum</b> is simulated, the minimal fluctuation spectrum is ignored. The flight cycles are 92314 and 92321 times respectively. Crack initiation nucleation is originated in the test piece near the surface. Fatigue crack is propagated between intergranular and transcrystalline rupture. Instantaneous, rupture zone and crack propagation can be observed...|$|R
40|$|Natural environments were {{determined}} {{for each of}} the Shuttle mission phases as a guide to design and operational decisions. The phases were categorized as mission planning, prelaunch, launch/ascent, booster recovery, on-orbit, and descent and landing. The wind criteria included magnitude/height, <b>gust</b> factors, turbulence <b>spectra,</b> wind shear, and vector properties for all flight and ground phases. A maximum design risk of 1 percent was permitted for the windiest two weeks the Shuttle would have to stay on the pad at either KSC or Vandenberg. The ascent wind profile was determined with the Jimsphere Vector Wind profiles, which cover the wind speeds, shears, gusts, and turbulence up to 18 km altitude. The models used to define the environmental situations of the Shuttle comprised wind, thermodynamic, space, lightning, sea state, mission analysis, and ET ice data base formulations...|$|R
40|$|Unsteady {{aerodynamic}} {{forces on}} a wing {{due to a}} uniform step gust are expressed as a sine transform of those due to sinusoidal <b>gusts</b> over the <b>spectrum</b> of wavelength. The sinusoidal gusts are treated by subsonic lifting-surface theory until the wavelength becomes so small as to demand excessive terms in the chordwise loading. Beyond this, the subptitution of piston theory is discussed for a wing representative of design for subsonic cruise. Lift and pitching moment are calculated for normal entry into a step gust at Mach numbers 0. 4 and 0. 8, with reasonable success in the latter case. The results for small distances of penetration are examined critically. It is recommended that the proportional growth of aerodynamc force be taken between the results of piston theory and the present method for small distances before approaching the latter result, {{which leads to the}} correct asymptotic behaviour soon after the wing is completely umnersed in the gust. The investigation ends with some calculations by the present method for normal entry into a ramp gust and by piston theory for obliqu...|$|R
40|$|US-Korea Worshop on New Frontier in Infrastructural/Seismic Engineering, Seoul, South Korea, 24 - 25 August 1999 A Wind and Structural Health Monitoring System (WASHMS) {{has been}} {{installed}} in the Tsing Ma suspension Bridge in Hong Kong {{with one of the}} objectives being the verification of analytical processes used in wind-resistant design. On 2 August 1997, Typhoon Victor just crossed over the Bridge and the WASHMS timely recorded both wind and structural response. The measurement data are analysed in this paper to obtain the mean wind speed, mean wind direction, mean wind inclination, turbulence intensity, integral scale, <b>gust</b> factor, wind <b>spectrum,</b> and the acceleration response and natural frequency of the Bridge. It is found that some features of wind structure and bridge response are difficult to be considered in the currently used analytical process for predicting buffeting response of long suspension bridges, for the Bridge is surrounded by a complex topography and the wind direction of Typhoon Victor changes during its crossing. It seems to be necessary to improve the prediction model so that a reasonable comparison can be performed between the measurement and prediction for long suspension bridges in typhoon prone regions.
