5|$|Reports were {{received}} in January 1849 that some Aboriginal {{people had been}} killed near Guichen Bay. On 19 February, the Protector of Aborigines, Matthew Moorhouse arrived in the district to investigate. He began his inquiries, assisted by a mounted policeman, an interpreter, and an Aboriginal guide. An Aboriginal witness, Leandermin, took Moorhouse {{to the site of}} the alleged crime. He told Moorhouse that he and a white man named Parker were walking along a road when they heard shots. He went to see what was happening, and from behind some trees, saw four or five Aboriginal women lying on the ground with fresh wounds. He also saw others on the ground, who he presumed were dead because they were not moving. Two white men were present, Leandermin identified Brown as one of them, and stated that Brown had a <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
500|$|In a DVD {{review of}} the third series of Spooks, Michael Mackenzie of Home Cinema had mixed views of Adam's introduction, stating [...] "despite ardent protests from both cast and crew, Tom and Adam are {{almost exactly the same}} character." [...] In the fifth series, Mackenzie felt more open towards Adam, stating Adam Carter [...] "isn't exactly James Bond [...] he doesn't jet around the world, bedding {{multiple}} women and engaging in fisticuffs atop precarious construction rigs, but he does rush around London with a <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> and occasionally ends up {{on the receiving end of}} the odd beating." [...] David Blackwell of Enterline Media was receptive of Adam in the fourth series, as he felt Adam became [...] "more fleshed out and interesting." [...] However, Blackwell was critical of Adam's role in the following fifth series, stating it is [...] "too much" [...] about him.|$|E
2500|$|At {{some point}} (Richardson's journal is unclear on when), Richardson and Hood {{began to suspect}} that Terohaute had killed the three missing voyageurs, and was disappearing from camp to feed on their corpses. The [...] "wolf meat" [...] they had eaten was {{probably}} human flesh. Then, on 20 October while Richardson and Hepburn were foraging, they heard a shot from the camp. They found Hood dead, and Terohaute standing with a <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b>|$|E
6000|$|Conger {{weighed the}} <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> [...] "It feels good," [...] he said. [...] "I know this gun--that is, I've seen them before, but I never used one." ...|$|R
60|$|Pan hurried {{through the}} dance hall, where the windows gave dim light, found the doorway, gained the side {{entrance}} to the street. Blinky waited there, smoking <b>guns</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
60|$|It was a {{call from}} close at hand and it made Dave jump as though stung by a snake. He whirled around, to behold a man behind a tree, a leveled <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Benavides {{waited in}} his truck until the gunman {{disappeared}} before assisting Tippit. He then reported the shooting to police headquarters, using the radio in Tippit's car. Helen Markham witnessed the shooting and then saw {{a man with a}} <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand</b> leave the scene. Markham identified Lee Harvey Oswald as Tippit's killer in a police lineup she viewed that evening. Barbara Davis and her sister-in-law Virginia Davis heard the shots and saw a man crossing their lawn, shaking his revolver, as if he were emptying it of cartridge cases. Later, the women found two cartridge cases near the crime scene and handed the cases over to police.|$|E
2500|$|TWA Flight 741 (type Boeing 707, serial 18917/460, {{registration}} [...] ) was a round-the-world flight carrying 144 {{passengers and}} {{a crew of}} 11. The flight on this day was flying from Tel Aviv, Israel to Athens, Frankfurt am Main and then to New York City, and was hijacked on the Frankfurt-New York leg. In an interview for the film Hijacked, Flight 741's purser, Rudi Swinkles, recalled, [...] "I saw a passenger running toward first class. I ran after him, {{and when he came}} to first class to the cockpit, he turned around, had a <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> and pointed the gun at me, and said, 'Get back, get back.' So right away, I dove behind the bulkhead first class divider, and I hid behind it, over here." ...|$|E
2500|$|On {{the evening}} of November 10, 1912, just {{three days after the}} finish of Eugene V. Debs' 4th — and arguably most {{successful}} — campaign as the Socialist Party's candidate for President of the United States, [...] Wayland retired upstairs to his bedroom. There he opened a drawer and removed a loaded handgun. He carefully wrapped the revolver with a sheet to muffle the sound of the explosion. He drew a breath, placed the <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> raised it to his open mouth, and shot himself in the brain. Wayland never regained consciousness, dying shortly after midnight, November 11, 1912. Harried by the government, despondent over the failure of the Socialist movement to win the support of more than {{a small fraction of the}} laboring classes, tired of life, Wayland left an epitaph tucked into a book on his bedside table: [...] "The struggle under the competitive system is not worth the effort; let it pass." ...|$|E
25|$|None of the {{defendants}} {{took part in the}} shooting. None was seen with a <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands.</b> None advised or abetted violence. Nothing in the evidence points to a conspiracy — much less proves it.|$|R
6000|$|... "There is a gun laid {{against a}} gate which leads into the field," [...] she said--"a gun, and by its side {{a bag of}} cartridges. Someone has been hiding behind the wall.

60|$|I {{dropped the}} handle. Ukridge dropped the jug. Mrs. Ukridge dropped her tea-cup. At the window, with a double-barrelled <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> stood a short, square, {{red-headed}} man. The muzzle of his gun, which {{rested on the}} sill, was pointing {{in a straight line}} at the third button of my waistcoat.|$|R
2500|$|When matters quieted down, Frank Grouard and [...] asked American Horse {{again if}} they {{would come out of}} the hole before any more were shot, telling them they would be safe if they surrendered. “After a few minutes deliberation, the chief, American Horse, a fine looking, broad-chested Sioux, with a {{handsome}} face and a neck like a bull, showed himself {{at the mouth of the}} cave, presenting the butt end of his rifle toward the General. He had just been shot in the abdomen, and said in his native language, that he would yield if the lives of the warriors who fought with him were spared. Chief American Horse had been shot through the bowels and was holding his entrails in his hands as he came out and presented the butt end of his rifle to General Crook. [...] Pourier recalled that he first saw American Horse kneeling with a <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> in a hole on the side of the ravine that he had scooped out with a butcher knife. Two of the squaws were also wounded. [...] Eleven were killed in the hole. Grouard recognized Chief American Horse, “but you would not have thought he was shot from his appearance and his looks, except for the paleness of his face. [...] He came marching out of that death trap as straight as an arrow. [...] Holding out one of his blood-stained hands he shook hands with me.” [...] When Chief American Horse presented the butt end of his rifle, General Crook, who took the proffered rifle, instructed Grouard to ask his name. [...] The Indian replied in Lakota, “American Horse.” [...] Some of the soldiers who lost their comrades in the skirmish shouted, “No quarter!’, but not a man was base enough to attempt shooting down the disabled chief. Crook hesitated for a minute and then said,‘Two or three Sioux, more or less, can make no difference. [...] I can yet use them to good advantage. [...] "Tell the chief,“ he said turning to Grouard, [...] "that neither he nor his young men will be harmed further.” [...] “This message having been interpreted to Chief American Horse, he beckoned to his surviving followers, and two strapping Indians, with their long, but quick and graceful stride, followed him out of the gully. [...] The chieftain’s intestines protruded from his wound, but a squaw, his wife perhaps, tied her shawl around the injured part, and then the poor, fearless savage, never uttering a complaint, walked slowly to a little camp fire, occupied by his people about 20 yards away, and sat down among the women and children.” ...|$|E

5000|$|Some {{people believe}} that the {{soldiers}} went up the forested hills and tried to shoot Devasahayam, but were unable to fire; after which he took the <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> blessed it and gave {{it back to the}} soldiers to shoot him to death, if they wished to. The soldiers took the gun back and fired at him five times. His body was then carelessly thrown out near the foothills at Kattadimalai.|$|R
60|$|On and on {{swept the}} little body of {{determined}} whites, each with <b>his</b> <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands,</b> and <b>his</b> {{eyes on the}} alert for {{the first sign of}} danger. The trail was still along the river, but presently it branched off, and entered an arrayo, or gully, thick with thorny plants and entangling vines. At the end of the arrayo was a rocky plateau, and here for the time being the trail was lost.|$|R

60|$|Someone thrust Marais forward, {{and there}} he stood quite silent, staring at us with a queer look upon his face and his <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand,</b> for he, too, was ready to ride.|$|E

As he stood with the <b>gun</b> <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hands</b> he received a fatal burst <b>in</b> <b>his</b> abdomen and fell to the ground with the <b>gun</b> still <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>hand.</b> He was awarded a posthumous Maha Vir Chakra.

60|$|Not {{five minutes}} later Blacky saw {{something}} that made him, oh, so glad he had kept watch.
