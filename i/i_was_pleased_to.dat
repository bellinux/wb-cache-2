Cherniss remarked once that all it amounted to was having one’s pay cut in half.) He {{spent most of his}} time maintaining his elaborate bibliography of Plato, carefully entering the information on each new book and article on an index card. He was still sharp and <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> be able to discuss Plato with him … ...|$|E
2500|$|...There are, in fact, two {{monitoring}} collections for 1948: one {{compiled by}} the BBC, the other by the CIA, both from Cyprus.

2500|$|When {{you lose}} your {{confidence}} you don't want to bowl again. When I went on the West Indies tour I had no confidence, even though I got 17 wickets {{at an average of}} about 25, and 10 of them were in first-class games. I only bowled about 78 overs on tour. When {{you lose your}} confidence it's not a nice feeling – you can't do what you used to do, but I'm only sorry it was the wrong day at the wrong time , because if I was myself, I assure you, in my opinion, I would have played more Test cricket, but that's only my assumption. I appreciated the experience , but after three months with no confidence [...] <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>pleased</b> <b>to</b> get back home.|$|E
