If the <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> is larger, the encoder emits a 1 bit and adds the step size to the reference sample. If the <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> is smaller, the encoder emits a 0 bit and subtracts the step size from the reference sample. The encoder also keeps the previous N bits of output (N = 3 or N = 4 are very common) to determine adjustments to the step size; if the previous N bits are all 1s or 0s, the step size is increased. Otherwise, the step size is decreased (usually in an exponential manner, with [...] being {{in the range of}} 5 ms). The step size is adjusted for every <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> processed.|$|E

40|$|Weighted Myriad Smoothers have {{recently}} been proposed as a class of nonlinear filters for robust non-Gaussian signal processing in impulsive noise environments. However, weighted myriad smoothers are severely limited, since their weights are restricted to be non-negative. This constraint makes them unusable in bandpass or highpass filtering applications which require negative filter weights. Further, they are incapable of amplifying selected frequency components of an input signal, since the output of a weighted myriad smoother always lies within the dynamic range of its <b>input</b> <b>samples.</b> In this paper, we generalize the weighted myriad smoother to a richer structure, a weighted myriad filter admitting real-valued weights.

40|$|Abstract: This paper {{presents}} a new structural method for {{the recognition of}} handwritten numerals. Contour shape features, such as convex arcs, concave arcs, line segments, end-point arcs and holes from the contours of numeric characters, are used to describe numeral characters. A new method of measuring the similarity between a sample and class is proposed. A two-stage recognition methodology is also presented, in which two rejection criteria are introduced. In {{the first stage of}} recognition, an <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> is given an identity or categorised as either first class or second class rejection, based on similarity measures between the <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> and each of the ten numeral classes. In the second stage of recognition, strategies are introduced to modify the structural description of the <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> if it is in first class rejection and a classifier focused on pairwise discrimination is applied if the <b>input</b> <b>sample</b> is in second class rejection. Experimental results indicate that the overall performance of the proposed method compares favourably with those achieved by other methods found in the literature...|$|E

40|$|Convolution sparse coding (CSC) has {{attracted}} much attention recently due to its advantages in image reconstruction and enhancement. However, the coding process suffers from perturbations caused by variations of <b>input</b> <b>samples,</b> as the consistence of features from similar <b>input</b> <b>samples</b> are not well addressed in the existing literature. In this paper, we will tackle this feature consistence problem from a set of samples via a proposed manifold constrained convolutional sparse coding (MCSC) method. The core idea of MCSC {{is to use the}} intrinsic manifold (Laplacian) structure of the input data to regularize the traditional CSC such that the consistence between features extracted from <b>input</b> <b>samples</b> can be well preserved. To implement the proposed MCSC method efficiently, the alternating direction method of multipliers (ADMM) approach is employed, which can consistently integrate the underlying Laplacian constraints during the optimization process. With this regularized data structure constraint, the MCSC can achieve a much better solution which is robust to the variance of the <b>input</b> <b>samples</b> against over-complete filters. We demonstrate the capacity of MCSC by providing the state-of-the-art results when applied it to the task of reconstructing light fields. Finally, we show that the proposed MCSC is a generic approach as it also achieves better results than the state-of-the-art approaches based on convolutional sparse coding in other image reconstruction tasks, such as face reconstruction, digit reconstruction and image restoration...|$|R
