Li and Wang proposed an algebra (SoDA) for specifying SoD requirements, {{in that it}} is not bound to any specific workflow model. In this paper, we both generalize SoDA and map it to enforcement mechanisms. First, we increase SoDA’s expressiveness by extending its semantics to mul-tisets. This better suits policy enforcement over workflows, where users may execute multiple tasks. Second, we further generalize SoDA to allow for changing role assignments. This lifts the strong restriction that au-thorizations do not change during workflow execution. Finally, we map SoDA terms to CSP processes, taking advantage of CSP’s operational semantics to provide the critical link between abstract specifications of SoD requirements by SoDA terms and runtime-enforcement mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Separation-of-Duty (SoD) {{policy is}} a {{fundamental}} security principle for prevention of <b>fraud</b> <b>and</b> <b>errors</b> in computer security. The research of static SoD (SSoD) policy in recently presented usage control (UCON) model has not been explored. Consequently, this paper attempts to address two important issues: the specification and enforcement of SSoD in UCON. We give a set-based specification scheme, which is simpler and more general than existing approaches. As for the enforcement, we study the problem of determining whether an SSoD policy is enforceable, and show that directly enforcing an SSoD {{policy is a}} coNP-complete problem. In indirect enforcement, we generate the least restrictive static mutually exclusive attribute (SMEA) constraints to enforce SSoD policies, by using the attribute level SSoD requirement as an intermediate step. The results are fundamental to understanding the effectiveness of using constraints to enforce SSoD policies in UCON...|$|R

Separation of duties is a time honored and universally practised principle for this purpose. That is, no individual is given sufficient authority within the system to perpetrate fraud on his own.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{significant}} difficulties with developing Service-Oriented Architecture (SOA) involves meeting its security challenges. Access control is an important security mechanism for organizations to protect their resources in collaborative environments and processes. In these processes, shared resources are often used and there are complex relationships between activities and users, so the definition and administration of different security levels (tasks, users, resources, etc.) is necessary. Different access control models and mechanisms have been proposed in recent years. However, under the new collaborative paradigm based on Web services and workflow technologies, some specific access control requirements should be addressed to support the various processes. In this paper, an access control model is proposed that considers the necessary elements to represent authentication, authorization and access control aspects in SOA environment.
