Asked if {{she might}} one day be lured back to mainstream stage, film or television, Harris said in the 2002 interview: Well, if someone handed me something fantastic for 10 million dollars, I'd work again. But I haven't worked {{in a long time}} as an actor. I don't miss it. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> thing that drew me to acting in the first place was the group of people I was working with: Ed Asner, Paul Sills, Mike Nichols, Elaine May. And all I really wanted to do back then was rehearsal. I was in it for the process, and I really resented having {{to go out and do}} a performance for an audience, because the process stopped; it had to freeze and be the same every night. It wasn't as interesting." ...|$|E
2500|$|On September 12, 2012, Def Jam France {{announced}} via Twitter that Rihanna {{would release}} a new single the upcoming week while her seventh studio album {{was scheduled to}} be released in November 2012. However, the tweet was shortly deleted and replaced with another clarifying that [...] "more information will be made available tomorrow, Thursday, September 13". To further promote the announcement for her seventh upcoming studio album, Rihanna launched a promotional website rihanna7.com. Via her official Twitter account, Rihanna posted series of [...] "teasing" [...] tweets announcing her seventh studio album. On October 11, 2012, she revealed the cover art and title of her new album, Unapologetic. VH1 ranked the cover at number one on their list of The 30 Hottest Naked Album Covers Ever. Regarding the title of the album, Rihanna explained that she named it because she wanted to express how honest she is, [...] "I named my album 'Unapologetic' because there is only one truth, and you can't apologise for that. It's honest. I'm always evolving of course, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> motto I have is to be true to myself." ...|$|E
2500|$|In their 1962 book Self-Portrait, Harish Booch and Karing Doyle {{commented that}} [...] "Unlike other stars, Madhubala prefers a veiled secrecy {{around her and}} is seldom seen in social gatherings or public functions." [...] (p.76), {{and went on to}} say that [...] "Contrary to general belief, Madhubala is rather simple and unassuming" [...] (p.78). This is echoed in Madhubala's sister's {{interview}} with Filmfare: [...] "(Madhubala) became a craze because she was never seen in public. She wasn't allowed to attend any function, any premiere. She had no friends. But she never resisted, she was obedient. Being protective, my father earned the reputation of being domineering". Dilip Kumar added: [...] "She was extremely popular... and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> star for whom people thronged outside the gates. Very often when shooting was over, there’d be a vast crowd standing at the gates just to have a look at Madhu... It wasn’t so for anyone else. That was her personal effect on fans. Her personality was vivacious." [...] But, [...] "She was aware of her beauty," [...] reminisces B. K. Karanjia, former Filmfare editor and a close friend of both Madhubala and her father, [...] "and because there were so many in love with her, she used to play one against the other. But it was out of innocence rather than shrewd calculation." [...] Dev Anand recalled in a similar way: [...] "She liked to flirt innocently and was great fun." [...] However, with Dilip Kumar she had a long association.|$|E

60|$|There {{are some}} who believe that our mental life is built up out of sensations alone.

[...] "I {{never knew}} her really to cut up. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> trouble she ever gave me was when I was {{training}} her to open gates. She was afraid when they swung back upon her--the animal's {{fear of the}} trap, perhaps. But she bravely got over it. And she never was vicious. She never bolted, nor bucked, nor cut up in all her life--never, not once." ...|$|E
60|$|To such, therefore, I am so {{far from}} moving for any favour, either from the law, or from their creditors, that <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{deficiency}} of the law at this time is, {{that it does not}} reach to inflict a corporal punishment in such a case, but leaves such insolvents to fare well, in common with those whose disasters are greater, and who, being honest and conscientious, merit more favour, but do not often find it.|$|E

60|$|Inasmuch as--in my belief--the {{very first}} {{editions of the}} book Science and Health were far above the reach of Mrs. Eddy's mental and {{literary}} abilities, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> she has {{from the very beginning}} been claiming as her own another person's book, and wearing as her own property laurels rightfully belonging to that person--the real author of Science and Health. And <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> reason--and <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason--that he has not protested is because his work was not exposed to print until after he was safely dead.|$|R
5000|$|The Thuggery Affair was {{relatively}} unsuccessful {{compared to other}} books in the series, being printed in only one hardback and one paperback edition during Forest's lifetime; it was finally reprinted by Girls Gone By in 2005. Commenting on the book, Antonia Forest explained it was, 'written during that long-dead period when teenagers talked self-invented languages, incomprehensible to any other age-group. Unfortunately, <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>I</b> was <b>the</b> <b>only</b> person who did understand what my characters were saying.' ...|$|R
6000|$|While this lively {{work had}} been doing in the center, {{there had been no}} lack of {{diligence}} elsewhere, and now all were as busy as bees. I have read of many [...] "successive attacks"--"charge after charge"--but <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> assaults after the first were those of the second Confederate lines and possibly some of the reserves; certainly there were no visible abatement and renewal of effort anywhere except where the men who had been pushed out of the works backward tried to reenter. And all the time there was fighting.|$|E
6000|$|There still {{hangs in}} his room in Mortimer Street an old Flemish picture, which he had picked up somewhere, of {{horsemen}} in doublets and plumed hats, fighting beneath {{the walls of a}} city. It was, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> painting in his possession. Perhaps it was this picture that represented to him the romance of which he spoke; but he did not hide from himself the terrible side of war. Happily thoughts about war can be given in his own words.

6000|$|... [104] This {{state of}} mind {{appears to have been}} the only one which Wordsworth had been able to discern in men of science; and in disdain of which, he wrote that {{short-sighted}} passage in the Excursion, Book III. l. 165-190, which is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one in the whole range of his works which his true friends would have desired to see blotted out. What else has been found fault with as feeble or superfluous, is not so in the intense distinctive relief which it gives to his character. But these lines are written in mere ignorance of the matter they treat; in mere want of sympathy with the men they describe; for, observe, though the passage is put into the mouth of the Solitary, it is fully confirmed, and even rendered more scornful, by the speech which follows.|$|E
2500|$|Grohl stated {{this song}} was, [...] "Just another pop song. It {{was the one}} song that nobody wanted {{to put on the}} record, but it's my {{favourite}} song. <b>I</b> <b>think</b> that <b>the</b> <b>only</b> reason it ended up on the record was that I re-did the drum track to make it sound like 'Crazy Little Thing Called Love' by Queen." ...|$|R
5000|$|I never {{realized}} that when I was a student. But {{there were no}} real jobs except in advertising as sketch artists or whatever.

60|$|These {{certainly}} were great encouragements {{to the study}} of historical jurisprudence, particularly of our own. Nor was there a want of materials or help for such an undertaking. Yet we have had few attempts in that province. Lord Chief Justice Hale's History of the Common Law is, <b>I</b> <b>think,</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one, good or bad, which we have. But with all the deference justly due to so great a name, we may venture to assert that this performance, though not without merit, is wholly unworthy of the high reputation of its author. The sources of our English law are not well, nor indeed fairly, laid open; the ancient judicial proceedings are touched in a very slight and transient manner; and the great changes and remarkable revolutions in the law, together with their causes, down to his time, are scarcely mentioned.|$|E
6000|$|... 691. Periodide {{of mercury}} being {{examined}} in the same manner, was found most distinctly to insulate whilst solid, but conduct when fluid, {{according to the law}} of liquido-conduction (402.); but there was no appearance of decomposition. No iodine appeared at the anode, nor mercury or other substance at the cathode. The case is, therefore, no exception to the rule, that only compounds of single proportionals are decomposable; but it is an exception, and <b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> one, to the statement, that all bodies subject to the law of liquido-conduction are decomposable. I incline, however, to believe, that a portion of protiodide of mercury is retained dissolved in the periodide, and that to its slow decomposition the feeble conducting power is due. Periodide would be formed, as a secondary result, at the anode; and the mercury at the cathode would also form, as a secondary result, protiodide. Both these bodies would mingle with the fluid mass, and thus no final separation appear, notwithstanding the continued decomposition.|$|E
6000|$|<b>I</b> <b>think</b> <b>the</b> <b>only</b> {{other point}} of Futurism is {{contained}} in this sentence: [...] "It is in Italy that we hurl this overthrowing and inflammatory Declaration, with which to-day we found Futurism, for we will free Italy from her numberless museums which cover her with countless cemeteries." [...] I think that rather sums it up. The best way, one would think, of freeing oneself from a museum would be not to go there. Mr. Marinetti's fathers and grandfathers freed Italy from prisons and torture chambers, places where people were held by force. They, being in the bondage of [...] "moralism," [...] attacked Governments as unjust, real Governments, with real guns. Such was their utilitarian cowardice that they would die in hundreds upon the bayonets of Austria. I can well imagine why Mr. Marinetti in his motor-car {{does not wish to}} look back at the past. If there was one thing that could make him look smaller even than before it is that roll of dead men's drums and that dream of Garibaldi going by. The old Radical ghosts go by, more real than the living men, to assault I know not what ramparted city in hell. And meanwhile the Futurist stands outside a museum in a warlike attitude, and defiantly tells the official at the turnstile that he will never, never come in.|$|E
