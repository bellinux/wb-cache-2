Numerous utility functions {{can be derived}}, one for each point on the production possibility frontier (PQ in the diagram above). A social utility frontier (also called a grand utility frontier) can be obtained from the outer envelope of all these utility functions. Each point on a social utility frontier represents an efficient allocation of an economy's resources; that is, it is a Pareto optimum in factor allocation, in production, in consumption, and in the interaction of production and consumption (supply and demand). In the diagram below, the curve MN is a social utility <b>frontier.</b> <b>Point</b> D corresponds with point C from the earlier diagram. Point D is on the social utility frontier because the marginal rate of substitution at point C is equal to the marginal rate of transformation at point A.

This paper addresses the problem of estimating both the full Euclidean surface structure and the camera motion from a dense set of silhouettes captured under orthographic or scaled orthographic projection. The approach relies on a viewpoint-invariant representation of curves swept by viewpoint-dependent features such as bitangents, inflections and contour points with parallel tangents. Feature points, which form stereo <b>frontier</b> <b>points</b> between non-consecutive images, are matched using this representation.

40|$|We {{study the}} problem of {{estimating}} the epipolar geometry from apparent contours of smooth curved surfaces with affine camera models. Since apparent contours are viewpoint dependent, the only true image correspondences are projections of the <b>frontier</b> <b>points,</b> i. e., surface points whose tangent planes are also their epipolar planes. However, <b>frontier</b> <b>points</b> are unknown a priori and must be estimated simultaneously with epipolar geometry.

We propose the first algorithm that guarantees global optimality for this problem. We first reformulate the problem using a separable form {{that allows us to}} search effectively in a 2 D space, instead of on a 5 D hypersphere in the classical formulation.

We extend this idea to treat pairs of images simultaneously to obtain more stable results and to recover the full motion of the camera in an image sequence.

40|$|Abstract: In DEA, {{there are}} {{typically}} two schemes for measuring efficiency of DMUs; radial and non-radial. Radial models assume proportional change of inputs/outputs and usually remaining slacks {{are not directly}} accounted for inefficiency. On the other hand, non-radial models deal with slacks of each input/output individually and independently, and integrate them into an efficiency measure, called slacks-based measure (SBM). In this paper, we point out shortcomings of the SBM and propose 4 variants of the SBM model. The original SBM model evaluates efficiency of DMUs referring to the furthest <b>frontier</b> <b>point</b> within a range. This results in the hardest score for the objective DMU and the projection may go to a remote point on the efficient frontier which may be inappropriate as the reference. In an effort to overcome this shortcoming, we first investigate frontier (facet) structure of the production possibility set. Then we propose Variation I that evaluates each DMU by the nearest point on the same frontier as the SBM found. However, there exist other potential facets for evaluating DMUs. Therefore we propose Variation II that evaluates each DMU from all facets. We then employ clustering methods to classify DMUs into several groups, and apply Variation II within each cluster. This Variation III gives more reasonable efficiency scores with less effort. Lastly we propose a random search method (Variation IV) for reducing the burden of enumeration of facets.

40|$|Purpose – In {{real estate}} industry, managers’ choices in {{portfolio}} construction impact {{directly on the}} performance of real estate fund. Looking at the literature, real estate diversification criteria are related to tenants’ characteristics, to endogenous and exogenous risk and to financial choices. The aim of the paper is to study the role of different risk profiles in the investment selection and in the construction of an efficient real estate portfolio. Design/methodology/approach – The first step is to find out an investment selection model based on the main risk factors. The aim was to check the ability of qualitative criteria (tenant, exogenous, endogenous and financial risks) to identify ex ante the best investment opportunities. The observation of the portfolios’ composition on the efficient frontier and the proximity of individual property to the efficient <b>frontier</b> <b>point</b> out which risk factors are more important. The second step is to define a model to construct a portfolio, with non correlated investments, based on the main risk factors. This ability was tested by comparing the classifications made according to quality criteria, which can potentially be used ex ante to construct a diversified portfolio, with the results of cluster analysis. The results from the cluster analysis, free from quality profiles, are therefore considered as the best diversification strategy. Findings – The results stemming from the use of a real estate database supplied by Fimit SGR (Unicredit banking group) showed that an ex ante study of risk profiles can help to identify those investment opportunities which are more or less near to the efficient frontier, although there is no prevailing criterion to identify a portfolio able to maximise investment diversification benefits. To identify more efficient portfolio is necessary to define an evaluation approach that considers simultaneously different risk profiles of real estate investments. Originality/value – The paper considers the Italian market, a young market for institutional real estate investments characterised by high growing opportunities. The value added of the paper is to study the relationship of different real estate specific risks considered in literature (tenant risk, endogenous and exogenous risk) and financing choices in order to define a more complete model to evaluate real estate portfolios...|$|E
