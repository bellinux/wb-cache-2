5000|$|Tanks for a {{particular}} fluid are chosen according to the flash-point of that substance. Generally in refineries and especially for liquid fuels, there are <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tanks,</b> and floating roof tanks.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> are {{typically}} used with products that have relatively low volatilities and flash points. Using a fixed roof tank to store a product with high volatility {{can lead to}} product losses as vapors escape the enclosure.|$|E
50|$|The roof has {{support legs}} hanging {{down into the}} liquid. At low liquid levels the roof {{eventually}} lands and a vapor space forms between the liquid surface and the roof, similar to a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b> The support legs are usually retractable to increase the working volume of the tank.|$|R
50|$|An {{external}} floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> is {{a storage}} tank {{commonly used to}} store large quantities of petroleum products such as crude oil or condensate. It comprises an open- topped cylindrical steel shell equipped with a roof that floats {{on the surface of}} the stored liquid. The roof rises and falls with the liquid level in the tank. As opposed to a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> there is no vapor space (ullage) in the floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> (except for very low liquid level situations). In principle, this eliminates breathing losses and greatly reduces the evaporative loss of the stored liquid. There is a rim seal system between the <b>tank</b> shell and <b>roof</b> to reduce rim evaporation.|$|R
40|$|Storage {{of crude}} oil and {{petroleum}} products inevitably leads to evaporative losses. Those losses are important for the industrial plants mass balances, {{as well as for}} the environmental protection. In this paper, estimation of evaporative losses was performed using software program TANKS 409 d which was developed by the Agency for Environmental Protection of the United States - US EPA. Emissions were estimated for the following types of storage tanks: <b>fixed</b> conical <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> <b>fixed</b> dome <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> external floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> internal floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> and domed external floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b> Obtained results show quantities of evaporated losses per tone of stored liquid. Crude oil <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> storage <b>tank</b> losses are cca 0. 5 kg per tone {{of crude oil}}. For floating roof, crude oil losses are 0. 001 kg/t. Fuel oil (diesel fuel and heating oil) have the smallest evaporation losses, which are in order of magnitude 10 - 3 kg/tone. Liquids with higher Reid Vapour Pressure have very high evaporative losses for <b>tanks</b> with <b>fixed</b> <b>roof,</b> up to 2. 07 kg/tone. In case of external floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> losses are 0. 32 kg/tone. The smallest losses are for internal floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> and domed external floating roof tank: 0. 072 and 0. 044, respectively. Finally, it can be concluded that the liquid with low volatility of low BTEX amount can be stored in <b>tanks</b> with <b>fixed</b> <b>roof.</b> In this case, the prevailing economic aspect, because the total amount of evaporative loss does not significantly affect the environment. On the other hand, storage of volatile derivatives with high levels of BTEX is not justified from the economic point of view or from the standpoint of the environment protection...|$|R
50|$|A {{fixed roof}} tank {{is a type}} of storage tank, used to store liquids, {{consisting}} of a cone- or dome-shaped roof that is permanently affixed to a cylindrical shell. Newer storage tanks are typically fully welded and designed to be both liquid- and vapor-tight. Older tanks, however, are often riveted or bolted, and are not vapor tight. A breather valve (pressure-vacuum valve), commonly installed on many <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tanks,</b> allows the tank to operate at a slight internal pressure or vacuum. This valve prevents the release of vapors during very small changes in temperature, barometric pressure, or liquid level. <b>Fixed</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> without breather valves will generally be freely vented; thus the emissions from a fixed roof tank can be non-trivial. Gauge hatches, sample wells, float gauges, and roof manholes provide accessibility to these tanks, and also act as potential sources of volatile emissions.|$|E
50|$|<b>Fixed</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> {{are meant}} for liquids with very high flash points, (e.g. fuel oil, water, bitumen etc.) Cone roofs, dome roofs and {{umbrella}} roofs are usual. These are insulated {{to prevent the}} clogging of certain materials, wherein the heat is provided by steam coils within the tanks. Dome roof tanks are meant for tanks having slightly higher storage pressure than that of atmosphere (e.g. slop oil).|$|E
40|$|This study {{applied a}} pilot-scale trickle-bed air {{biofilter}} (TBAB) system for treating waste gas emitted from the breather vent of a vertical <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> storage <b>tank</b> containing p-xylene (p-X) liquid. The {{volatile organic compound}} (VOC) concentration of the waste gas was related to ambient temperature as well as solar radiation, peaking at above 6300 ppmv of p-X and 25000 ppmv of total hydrocarbons during the hours of 8 AM to 3 PM. When the activated carbon adsorber was employed as a VOC buffer, the peak waste gas VOC concentration was significantly reduced resulting in a stably and efficiently performing TBAB system. The pressure drop appeared to be low, reflecting that the TBAB system could be employed in the prolonged operation with a low running penalty. These advantages suggest that the TBAB system is a cost-effective treatment technology for VOC emission from a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> storage <b>tank...</b>|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{settlement}} data of {{oil storage}} tanks {{made of steel}} are measured by the measurement points located {{around the base of}} the tank wall. The measured settlement data need to be curve fitted in order to reflect the settlement distribution around the whole tank wall base. Considering about the disadvantage of measured settlement data treatment methods on tanks in current standards, an optimization method of curve fitting on the measured settlement data is presented. The Fourier series expansion is used to analyze the measured settlement data, the fitting curves and mean square error according to different order are obtained. The fitting curve with minimum mean square error is selected as the most appropriate one that reflects the actual displacement of the tank base. The optimization method of curve fitting present is applied to analyze the measured settlement data obtained from the floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> and the <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b> Results show that different effects can be obtained with different order of the fitting curve. Curve fitting referring to different order is necessary to the measured settlement data in actual engineering in order to find the most appropriate one that reflects the real tank base displacement distribution...|$|R
40|$|Storage tanks {{have been}} widely used in many {{industrial}} particularly in the oil refinery and petrochemical industry which are to store a multitude of different product with crude oil as one if it. There are different types of <b>tank</b> such as <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> open <b>roof</b> <b>tank,</b> floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> etc. Floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> is which the roof floats directly on top of the product, with no vapour space and eliminating the possibility of flammable atmosphere. There are various industrial code and standard available for the basic requirement for tank design and construction. Commercial software are also available in the market for the basic design, hence tank designer would rely wholly on the software without detail understanding. Despite of the various standard and code, there is limited procedure and rules in designing the floating roof which result lots of floating roof failure and caused injuries and fatalities accident. Design and safety concern has been a great concern for the increasing case of fire and explosion due the tank failure. The main objective of this project is “How to design a new floating roof tank”. The aim of this project is to develop basic rules and procedures, highlighting the concerns in designing, construction and operation of a floating roof by taking an existing Oil Development Project with it’s readily available information as a base, to design the tank, and identify the problematic and lesson learnt throughout the projec...|$|R

40|$|International audienceWhen a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> storage <b>tank</b> is {{surrounded}} by a pool fire, and when the vents are not correctly dimensioned, the inside pressure can raise until the mechanical limits of the structure. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a tool that will allow to follow the variations of the pressure and temperature in the gas phase, as a function of the size of the vent. This will help the sizing of new tank's vents or evaluating the risk of already build structures. The model also gives the temperature's distribution in the liquid phase, at each time step. In case of undersized vents, this information will be convenient to describe the phenomenological aspect of the accident after the rupture of the tank i. e., to qualify and quantify the fire ball generated and its effect on persons and structures. Currently, if few analytical models exist to quantify the fire ball and its effects after the rupture, none are able to describe with accuracy the prerupture phenomena.

40|$|There {{are about}} 500, 000 crude oil storage tanks in the United States. These tanks {{are used to}} hold oil for brief periods of {{time in order to}} {{stabilize}} flow between production wells and pipeline or trucking transportation sites. In addition, the condensate liquids contained in produced gas that are captured by a mist eliminator filter/ coalescer ahead of the first compressor station in transmission pipelines are often directed to a storage tank as well. During storage, light hydrocarbons dissolved in the crude oil or condensate—including methane and other volatile organic compounds (VOC), natural gas liquids (NGLs), hazardous air pollutants (HAP), and some inert gases—vaporize or "flash out " and collect in the space between the liquid and the <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> of the <b>tank.</b> As the liquid level in the tank fluctuates, these vapors are ofte...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThis study {{deals with}} one of the {{phenomena}} which is able to generate fire balls like the one which was observed during the 1987 Edouard Herriot port of Lyon fire. Reflections led on this accident have pushed to consider the phenomenon of tank pressurization as a potential initiating event of the fire ball observed. In concrete terms, when a <b>fixed</b> <b>roof</b> storage <b>tank</b> is surrounded by a pool fire, and when the vents or the insulation are not correctly designed, the inside pressure can raise until the mechanical limits of the structure are reached. The aim {{of this study is to}} develop a tool which will allow to follow the variations of the pressure and temperature in the gas phase, highlighting if a pressure increase is possible or not. This will help the sizing of new tank vents and insulation of the walls, or evaluating the risk of already build structures, by solving the question occurrence of the accident, regarding the estimated external fire duration. The model also gives the temperature distribution in the liquid phase, at each time step. In case of rupture, this information will be useful to describe the phenomenological aspect of the accident after the rupture of the tank. It means that qualifying and quantifying the fire ball generated and its effect on persons and structures will be possible. Currently, although a few analytical models exist to quantify the fire ball and its effects after the rupture, none is able to describe with accuracy the pre-rupture phenomena. This model is a work in progress, and at the end, the tool will take into account the two phases of the accident and will allow to study complete and consistent scenarios.

40|$|Abstract: The {{heat loss}} and surface {{temperature}} of the top surface and sidewall of large-scale floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> is tested by the heat flow meter and surface temperature method. Based on the test data, the heat loss from the top surface is about twice more {{than that of the}} sidewall which means the top surface is the weakest insulation part of the floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b> On the surface, the heat loss profile is in accord with the surface temperature distribution. Special attention is given on the calculation of thermal conductivity for the top surface and sidewall which finally deduced the total heat transfer coeffi-cient of large floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank.</b> Moreover, the heat loss of floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> in different working conditions is predicted.

40|$|AbstractThe basic {{characteristics}} of full surface fires of large scale floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> are briefed. It is {{pointed out that}} the present fire fighting systems of large scale crude oil storage depots cannot meet the need to extinguish full surface fires of large scale floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks.</b> Adequate data of successful extinguishment of large scale tanks full surface fires and full scale tank fire experiments in the world are badly needed to design fire fighting system to extinguish full surface fires of large scale tanks in large scale crude oil storage depots. According to “Code of design for low expansion foam extinguishing system” and relative study results abroad, the fire fighting systems are calculated and designed to deal with full surface fires of large scale floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks.</b> It is shown that designing parameters provided by API are more credible and large foam monitors act as the main fire extinguish facilities. The fire water supplying system is designed according to “Fire prevention code of petrochemical enterprise design”.

40|$|Floating roofs {{are widely}} used to prevent {{evaporation}} of content in large cylindrical aboveground oil storage tanks. The 2003 Hokkaido Earthquake caused severe damages to the floating roofs due to sloshing.

40|$|The {{subject of}} {{petroleum}} storage tank fires {{has gained a}} great deal of attention due to the high cost of petroleum, and the consequent disruption of petroleum production; therefore, much of the current research has focused on petroleum storage tank fires. Also, the number of petroleum tank fires is oscillating between 15 and 20 fires per year. About 33 % of all tank fires are attributed to lightning. Floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> (FRT’s) are especially vulnerable to lightning. To minimize the likelihood of a fire, the API RP 545 recommends three major modifications to floating <b>roof</b> <b>tanks.</b> This paper was inspired by a stroke of lightning that ignited a fire in a crude oil storage tank belonging to an Egyptian oil company, and is aimed at providing an efficient lightning protection system to the tank under study, in order to avoid the occurrence of such phenomena in the future and also, to give valuable recommendations to be applied to floating <b>roof</b> <b>tank</b> projects...|$|R

5000|$|In the UK, {{prior to}} the use of sealed {{expansion}} tanks, [...] "open" [...] tanks were installed in the roof space to accommodate the water's expansion; these had the disadvantage of being exposed to the cold air in the roof space. This, without effective loft insulation, could fall below freezing, and could cause the pipework supplying the tank to freeze. However, with good pipe and tank insulation, this was in practice quite rare. Although such systems were remarkably trouble free, there are concerns about the potability of water from <b>roof</b> <b>tanks</b> due to the possibility of contamination.
