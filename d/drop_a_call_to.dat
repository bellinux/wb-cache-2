50|$|Optimization is an {{important}} step in the life cycle of a wireless network. Drive testing {{is the first step in}} the process, with the goal of collecting measurement data as a function of location. Once the data has been collected over the desired RF coverage area, it is output to post-processing software. Engineers can use the collection and post-processing software to identify the causes of RF coverage or interference problems and determine how these problems can be solved. When the problems, causes and solutions have been identified, steps are performed to solve the problems. Network statistics are also {{an important}} step in analysis and troubleshooting of RF issues. Every node (BTS, BSC, MSC) has its own counters some of which are incremented/decremented on occurrence of different events e.g. <b>a</b> <b>dropped</b> <b>call</b> due <b>to</b> low signal strength. These statistics are analysed using different graphs and reports and when KPI from the statistics exceed the limit, extensive analysis is carried out to identify and troubleshoot the problem.|$|R
40|$|Third Generation (3 G) Mobile Communication {{systems will}} provide {{enhanced}} high-speed data, multimedia, and voice services to mobile users. Beam forming techniques {{have been proposed}} to increase the spectral efficiency of the wireless channel In a commercially deployed 3 G system, it is Hkely that the two techniques will co-exist. Resource management in a wireless system should take care of channel impairements and non-ideal antenna patterns. Mobile users moving from one beam to another give rise to resource reallocation issues. In this paper, we propose a resource allocation and management scheme tailored to systems with smart antennas supporting heterogeneous users. The algorithm works by comparing the received power in each beam. Elasticity of user requirements for data services is exploited to provide adaptive QoS to the users, thereby preventing <b>dropping</b> of <b>a</b> <b>call</b> due <b>to</b> user mobility. Simulation results showing the channel and MAI effects on system performance are presented. The throughput advantage obtained using the management scheme is compared to a system without resource management. It is also seen that the throughput of the system increases for a user population exhibiting higher elasticity. In addition the algorithm can be modified <b>to</b> also handle <b>call</b> hand-off...|$|R

40|$|Provisioning of Quality of Service (QoS) is a {{key issue}} in any {{multi-media}} system. However, in wireless systems, supporting QoS requirements of different traffic types is more challenging due {{to the need to}} minimize two performance metrics - the probability of <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> handover <b>call</b> and the probability of blocking <b>a</b> new <b>call.</b> Since QoS requirements are not as stringent for non-real-time traffic types, as opposed to real-time traffic, more calls can be accommodated by releasing some bandwidth from the already admitted non-real-time traffic calls. If we require that such a released bandwidth <b>to</b> accept <b>a</b> handover <b>call</b> ought <b>to</b> be larger than the bandwidth <b>to</b> accept <b>a</b> new <b>call,</b> then the resulting probability of <b>dropping</b> <b>a</b> handover <b>call</b> will be smaller than the probability of blocking <b>a</b> new <b>call.</b> In this paper we propose <b>an</b> efficient <b>Call</b> Admission Control (CAC) that relies on adaptive multi-level bandwidth-allocation scheme for non-real-time calls. The scheme allows reduction of the call dropping probability along with increase of the bandwidth utilization. The numerical results show that the proposed scheme is capable of attaining negligible handover call dropping probability without sacrificing bandwidth utilization...|$|R
