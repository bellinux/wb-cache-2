40|$|This {{research}} project {{stems from a}} single puzzle: how can constitutional amendments be unconstitutional? Adopting a combination of theoretical and comparative enquiries, this thesis establishes the nature and scope <b>of</b> constitutional <b>amendment</b> powers {{by focusing on the}} question of substantive limitations on the amendment power, looking at both their prevalence in practice and the conceptual coherence of the very idea <b>of</b> limitations to <b>amendment</b> powers. The thesis is composed of three parts. The first part is comparative. It examines substantive explicit and implicit limitations on constitutional amendment powers through manifold <b>descriptions</b> <b>of</b> a similar constitutional phenomenon across countries, demonstrating a comprehensive pattern of a constitutional behaviour. This process is theory-driven, and {{the second part of the}} thesis constructs a general theory of unamendability, which explains the nature and scope <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> powers. The third part explains how judicial review <b>of</b> <b>amendments</b> is to be conceived in light of the theory of unamendability, and further assesses the possible objections to the theory of unamendability. The theory of unamendability identifies and develops a middle ground between constituent power and pure constituted power, a middle ground that is suggested by the French literature on ‘derived constituent power’. Undergirding the discussion, therefore, is a simple yet fundamental distinction between primary constituent (constitution-making) power and secondary constituent (constitution-amending) power. This distinction, understood in terms of an act of delegation of powers, enables the construction of a theory of the limited (explicitly or implicitly) scope of secondary constituent powers. This distinction is supplemented by a further one, between various shades of secondary constituent powers along a ‘spectrum’, a theoretical construct that links amendment procedures to limitations on amendment powers. The theory of unamendability explicates the limited nature <b>of</b> <b>amendment</b> powers and the practice of judicial review <b>of</b> <b>amendments,</b> thus clarifying the puzzle <b>of</b> unconstitutional constitutional <b>amendments...</b>|$|R
