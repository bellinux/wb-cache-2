These factors can be broadly divided into two categories, namely, the personal factors and the environmental fac-tors (Stone and Colella, 1996). This case also touches upon issues like due diligent efforts that need to be made to accommodate the <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability,</b> the acceptance of the <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> into organization and into main stream society, and stere-otyping of <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> This case can also be extended to sensitize individuals and managers to other forms of disability and to educate them about the legal provisions made both nationally and internationally.

40|$|This study explores how {{exposure}} to disability portrayal on television {{is related to}} beliefs about <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> This study uses show-specific cultivation theory and its discussion of how television viewing can influence perceptions and beliefs {{as well as social}} cognitive theory and the process of media identification. An online survey was conducted to examine respondents' viewing habits of the television program Glee, which featured several characters who had varying disabilities (wheelchair use, down syndrome and many others), and how viewing these mediated representations related to beliefs about <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> The results showed that identification with Artie, a main character on Glee <b>with</b> a <b>disability,</b> is correlated <b>with</b> frequency of viewing as well as more positive beliefs about <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> In addition, any viewing of Glee, rather than frequency, was also related to more positive beliefs about <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> While social cognitive theory, in particular identification, showed strong relationships with findings, results did not line up with cultivation as frequency of viewing did not correlate with more positive beliefs. Overall, the research demonstrated that portrayal of disability in the media relates to beliefs about <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> and hopes to encourage more inclusion in the media landscape as well as additional research related to disability in the media...|$|R
40|$|Increased {{risk for}} chronic disease is closely {{associated}} <b>with</b> <b>individual</b> nutrition, tobacco use, and physical inactivity. This thesis focuses on physical activity {{as a means}} of preventing select chronic diseases. A major barrier preventing engagement in physical activity is the built environment. Populations residing in rural environment are not afforded the abundance of opportunities for physical activity prevalent in most urban networks. Of the demographic living in rural environments, <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> face additional barriers to physical activity than those without disability. This leads to a higher prevalence of chronic diseases associated with sedentary lifestyles among populations <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> Few studies address the correlation between physical activity, chronic disease, and the built environment as they relate to <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> This thesis utilized independent samples t tests to evaluate variation among physical activity levels and the prevalence of chronic disease. In the first paper, four research objectives defined the parameters for comparison: (1) physical activity for <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in rural versus urban environments; (2) physical activity in rural environments for <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> and without disability; (3) prevalence of chronic disease for <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> in rural versus urban areas; and (4) prevalence of chronic disease in rural environments for <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> and without <b>disability.</b> The four research objectives of the second paper are: (1) rural and urban physical activity comparison for the highest disability classification; (2) rural and urban physical activity comparison for <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> using equipment; (3) rural and urban physical activity comparison for <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability</b> resulting from physical, mental, or emotional impairments; and (4) rural and urban physical activity comparison for individuals not reporting disability. The 2011 Behavioral Risk Factor Surveillance System (BRFSS) provided the data used to evaluate the correlation between these variables. The results of both studies indicate important statistical significance relating the rural built environment to lower levels of physical activity for <b>individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>disability.</b> The varied statistical significance and small effect sizes, however, were contrary to the hypothesis and warrants further exploration of the complex relationship regarding the built environment, physical activity, and chronic disease...|$|R

25|$|In the United States, {{there have}} been three major {{policies}} addressing special education in the United States. These policies were the Education for All Handicapped Children Act in 1975, the <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> Education Act in 1997, and the No Child Left Behind in 2001. The development of these policies showed increased guidelines for special education and requirements; such as requiring states to fund special education, equality of opportunities, help with transitions after secondary schooling, requiring extra qualifications for special education teachers, and creating a more specific class setting for those with disabilities. The <b>Individuals</b> <b>with</b> <b>Disabilities</b> Education Act, specifically had a large impact on special education as public schools were then required to employ high qualified staff.
