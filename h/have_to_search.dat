25|$|Lois Lane {{appears in}} the Atari 2600 Superman video game. If Superman is hit by one of Lex Luthor's roving Kryptonite satellites, he loses his powers. Touching Lois will restore them. Depending on the {{difficulty}} setting, she will either appear immediately when Superman is hit or the player will <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> for her.|$|E
25|$|Yet they cannot boil it all, for – first, fuel is very scarce; {{that which}} is {{supplied}} weekly would not cook a meal a day…and they <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> the already bare kopjes for a supply. There is hardly a bit to be had. Second, they have no extra utensil to hold the water when boiled. I propose, therefore, to give each tent a pail or crock, and get a proclamation issued that all drinking water must be boiled.|$|E
25|$|Anti-hunting campaigners long urged hunts {{to retain}} their {{tradition}} and equestrian sport by drag hunting, following an artificial scent. Drag hunting involves hunting a scent that has been laid (dragged) over a course with a defined beginning and end, before the day's hunting. The scent, usually a combination of aniseed oils and possibly animal meats or fox urine, is dragged along the terrain for distances usually of 10 or more miles. However, drag hunting is disliked by some advocates of quarry hunting because the trail is pre-determined, thereby eliminating the uncertainty present in the live quarry hunt and {{because they tend to}} be faster. Supporters contend that while drag hunts can be fast, this need not be the case if the scent line is broken up so that the hounds <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> an area to pick up the line.|$|E

25|$|As {{the vast}} rail network spread above ground, {{an even larger}} network of {{railways}} served the rapidly expanding system of coal veins underground. Miners, who {{in the early years}} were typically Welsh and Irish, were hired as cheaply as possible by the coal barons. The workers endured low pay, long hours and unsafe working conditions. Children as young as eight or nine worked 14-hour days separating slate from coal in the breakers. Often, the workers were forced to use company-provided housing and purchase food and other goods from stores owned by the coal companies. With hundreds of thousands of immigrants arriving in the industrial cities, mine owners did not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> for labor and workers struggled to keep their positions. Later miners came from Italy and eastern Europe, which people fled because of poverty and lack of jobs.|$|E
25|$|A {{significant}} improvement {{can be made}} with an index. In the example above, initial disk reads narrowed the search range by a factor of two. That can be improved substantially by creating an auxiliary index that contains the first record in each disk block (sometimes called a sparse index). This auxiliary index would be 1% {{of the size of the}} original database, but it can be searched more quickly. Finding an entry in the auxiliary index would tell us which block to search in the main database; after searching the auxiliary index, we would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> only that one block of the main database—at a cost of one more disk read. The index would hold 10,000 entries, so it would take at most 14 comparisons. Like the main database, the last 6 or so comparisons in the aux index would be on the same disk block. The index could be searched in about 8 disk reads, and the desired record could be accessed in 9 disk reads.|$|E
500|$|In 1910, Horace Avory {{became a}} judge. Hastings first found {{out when he}} read the report in the morning newspapers, and was dismayed that he would again <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> for a tenancy at another {{chambers}}. He instead {{had the idea that}} he could take over Avory's chambers himself, allowing him to avoid the trouble of finding a new tenancy. Maintaining a set of chambers was very expensive, however; as well as paying the rent, the head of chambers would be expected to pay the clerks. Hastings suggested to Avory that Avory could pay the rent, and Hastings would then pay him back when he had the money. Despite Avory's reputation as [...] "cold and hard" [...] he agreed to this idea, and even let Hastings keep the furniture, including Avory's valuable chair which had once belonged to Harry Poland.|$|E

2500|$|The {{oxidizing}} flame {{is the third}} possible flame adjustment. It occurs when the ratio of oxygen to acetylene required for a neutral flame has been changed to give an excess of oxygen. This flame type is observed when welders add more oxygen to the neutral flame. This flame is hotter {{than the other two}} flames because the combustible gases will not <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> so far to find the necessary amount of oxygen, nor heat up as much thermally inert carbon. It is called an {{oxidizing flame}} because of its effect on metal. This flame adjustment is generally not preferred. The oxidizing flame creates undesirable oxides to the structural and mechanical detriment of most metals. In an oxidizing flame, the inner cone acquires a purplish tinge, gets pinched and smaller at the tip, {{and the sound of the}} flame gets harsh. A slightly oxidizing flame is used in braze-welding and bronze-surfacing while a more strongly oxidizing flame is used in fusion welding certain brasses and bronzes ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{the glacier}} melted, {{the area was}} cold and wet. The area was a [...] Tundra Biome which grasses grew slowly. [...] This is when Paleo Indians came into the area around 11,000 B.C. [...] After several {{thousand}} years, the area became warmer. As the climate warmed, vegetation patterns changed. [...] With change in plant life, [...] herbivore megafauna slowly died out. [...] Or were concentrated in certain areas which allowed for over hunting by Paleo-Indians. [...] Coniferous forests of spruce and pine began to grow. [...] The area then became a Taiga Biome. [...] Paleo Indians carried spears with fluted points made of black chert or jasper. [...] They used Culver's Gap to travel from the Flatbrook Valley to the Kittatinny Valley. [...] This route was later used by Native Americans. [...] Paleo Indians made temporary camps and traveled often as they were hunter gatherers. [...] It is difficult to locate their camps as they are located many feet below the present ground surface of today. One would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> the Pleistocene gravels.|$|E
2500|$|... "Witness" [...] is not {{the only}} episode to be altered from its {{original}} concept. [...] "Dichotic" [...] began, in its early stages, as a story about a news reporter who had the ability—thanks to kryptonite—to split himself in half. The reporter would create the news {{at the same time that}} he was filming it. Ken Biller and Mark Verheiden discussed a teaser that involved the reporter pushing someone out of a window and as the body plummeted to the ground the audience saw the same person reporting the news as it happened. The main story would focus on the reporter attempting to assassinate Lex Luthor, but it eventually evolved into what Biller refers to as [...] "a metaphor on trying to super-achieve at high school". In the revamped version, a high school student uses his ability to duplicate himself so that he can take classes in high school and at the community college at the same time, in an effort to win a LuthorCorp scholarship and go to the university of his dreams. With Jonathan Taylor Thomas playing the over-achieving student, the character of Ian Randall was also used to stir up the Lana-Clark-Chloe triangle. Beeman explains that a problem exists in developing new storylines involving the characters: [...] "We want the characters we're familiar with, and on the other , you <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>search</b> for ways to change them up." [...] Even the ending was altered during filming, as both copies of Ian were to fall over the edge of a bridge; then, as the two Ians fall they touch each other's fingers slowly fusing together before hitting the ground. The team was so impressed with Thomas's performance they opted to keep the character alive.|$|E
