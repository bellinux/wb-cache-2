30|$|Two {{additional}} studies investigated the potential effects of Canephron® N on {{the rates of}} congenital malformations [38, 39]. Repina et al. followed up 115 children (aged 5  months– 3.5  years) born to women who were treated with Canephron® N during {{the second or third}} trimester of pregnancy. The study reported no adverse effects on the fetus during pregnancy and no post-partum effects on the children born to mothers who had been treated with the drug while pregnant [39]. A large prospective-retrospective study evaluating the teratogenic, embryotoxic and <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of Canephron® N in 1647 women indicated no evidence of any developmental or congenital effects [38]. Our data builds on the findings from these studies, suggesting that the use of Canephron® N during the first trimester of pregnancy is not associated with teratogenic effects in the fetus.|$|R
40|$|Cancer is {{diagnosed}} in approximately 1 in 1, 000 pregnancies, 1 constituting a major disruption {{in the life}} of the pregnant woman and her family. Advanced disease stages requiring systemic therapy invariably lead the treating physicians into an ethical dilemma: two lives are at risk. Administering the cancer treatment to themothermayharm the unborn child as it is exposed to cytostatic drugs. On the contrary, omitting therapy will deny necessary treatment to the mother, but the unborn child will also carry the risk of prematurity if the disease progresses rapidly. Once the decision is taken to accept this risk and to start chemotherapy, the choice of possible regimens will not only be based on their expected anticancer activity but also on available experience regarding <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Due to the typical age distribution and standardized examination protocols in pregnancy, gynecologic cancer...|$|R

To evaluate the cytogenetics and developmental effects of cipralex throughout major organgenesis, mice were administrated orally with a doses of 0. 06, 0. 12 and 0. 24 mg/kg/day cipralex on gestation days 1 - 18 and examined on the 19 th day of gestation for evidence of maternal and fetal toxicity. Cipralex at different doses tested produce significant toxic effects in reproductive parameters. Significant embryo <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> were observed at tested dose levels as evidenced by total number of implantations, post. Implantation loss and embryo malformations. There were increases in the frequencies of micronuclei and chromosomal aberrations in both maternal and embryonic cells treated with cipalex, these increases were dose dependent.

40|$|The aim of {{the present}} study was to explore the <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of {{cypermethrin}} (CY) in female rabbits with low and high doses. For this purpose, 32 adult female rabbits were divided in to four equal groups A, B, C and D. Rabbits of groups A, B and C were treated with different levels of CY at the dose rate of 25, 50 and 75 mg/kg body weight intraperitoneally, while the group D served as a control and was given equal volume of normal saline intraperitoneally. The clinical signs exhibited by the rabbits treated with CY included salivation, licking of different body parts, muscular tremors, ataxia and convulsions. There was a significant difference in the numbers of CL and number of fetuses which mean the early embryonic death and post implantation loses at the high dose. There were microscopic changes in the ovaries and uteri of animals treated with CY...|$|R
40|$|A single {{intraperitoneal}} injection (0. 6 ml/kg) of dimethoxyethyl phthalate (DMEP) {{was given to}} groups of Wistar strain rats on day 10, 11, 12, 13 or 14 of gestation. Control rats received 0. 6 ml/kg of physiological saline intraperitoneally. In phthalate-treated rats, embryopathy was manifested by a high incidence (12 - 79 %) of fetal deaths and fetal resorptions. <b>Fetotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> were expressed by {{a significant reduction in}} fetal weights. Hydrocephalus interna, a congenital malformation of the brain, was caused by DMEP. Congenital skeletal deformities (66 - 96 %), with multiple skeletal (14 - 64 %) and appendicular malformations (25 - 57 %), were also induced by DMEP. Control rats exhibited no congenital malformations of the brain and no appendicular or multiple skeletal deformities. DMEP caused a significant decrease in the zinc content of the fetus. Fetoplacental metabolism 1 and 4 hr after intravenous administration of 14 C-DMEP suggested rapid transfer of the parent compound to the fetus across the placenta and that DMEP is a teratogenic moiety. The possible role of zinc in phthalate-induced teratogenesis in rats is also discussed...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: The {{potential}} embryotoxic and <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> ofpolychlorobiphenyls (PCBs) {{have been}} reported only in rabbits,rats, mice, mink and gerbils. No data are available concerning the effectsof PCBs (in particular, Aroclor 1254) on ovine reproduction andoffspring growth rate and the ultrastructural modifications of blastocystsdue to exposure to these toxic compounds. The aim of this studywas to analyze ultrastructural anomalies induced in ovine blastocystsby different concentrations of PCB (Aroclor 1254). Materials and Methods: Ovine blastocysts were fixed in 2. 5 %glutaraldehyde, post-fixed in OsO 4, dehydrated, rinsed in propyleneoxide and embedded in epoxy resin. Semi-thin and ultrathin sectionswere stained with toluidine blue and uranyl acetate and lead citrate,respectively. Results: All treated blastocysts were characterized by increased lipiddroplets, severe cytoplasmic vacuolation (single membrane-boundvacuoles and empty lacunae containing whorled membrane, granularosmiophilic material or laminated membranes), marked mitochondrialswelling with loss of cristae and pyknosis, and a few autolysosomescontaining mitochondrial remnants. Conclusions: Embryos treated with PCBs show severe ultrastructuralmodifications not dependent on PCB concentration and correlatedto the progressive increase of cell mortality rate indicated bystudies in vitro. These results contribute to knowledge of the harmfuleffects of these compounds on reproduction and embryonal growthrate. [ [...] . ...|$|R
40|$|Both {{ethylene}} and {{propylene glycol}} alkyl ethers (EGAEs and PGAEs, respectively) are widely used, mainly as solvents, in industrial and household products. Some EGAEs demonstrate gonadotoxic, embriotoxic, <b>fetotoxic</b> and teratogenic <b>effects</b> in both humans and experimental animals. Due to the noxious {{impact of these}} ethers on reproduction and development of organisms EGAEs are replaced for considerably less toxic PGAEs. The data on the mechanisms of testicular, embriotoxic, <b>fetotoxic</b> and teratogenic <b>effects</b> of EGAEs are presented in this paper.

40|$|Mono(2 -ethylhexyl) {{phthalate}} (MEHP), one of {{the main}} metabolites of di(2 -ethylhexyl) phthalate (DEHP), exerted embryo/fetotoxic effects similar to those of DEHP at lower doses. Oral administration of MEHP (1 mL/kg) to the mice of 8 days gestation resulted in less than 32 % of live fetuses, all of which were deformed. When DEHP (10 mL/kg) was given to the pregnant mice of 8 days gestation, approximately 0. 03 % and 0. 003 % of the administered dose was found in fetuses as DEHP and MEHP, respectively, after 12 hr. The presence of the MEHP in fetuses is probably due to the transplacental crossing of the MEHP formed in the maternal body, since the fetuses of mice up to day 9 of pregnancy showed no hydrolytic activity of DEHP to MEHP. Crossing of MEHP through the placenta was proven by an experiment in which MEHP was administered in pregnant mice. A single injection of MEHP (25 or 50 mg/kg), but not DEHP (500 mg/kg) into pregnant mice, induced a significantly high incidence of somatic mutations in the coat hair of offspring of mice (KYG, 9 x PW, d; C 57 BL/ 6 Crj, 9 x PW, 6). All these data suggest that MEHP could be responsible for the embryotoxic/ <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> observed with DEHP...|$|R
40|$|Pregnant Quackenbush Special mice {{were exposed}} to ethanol under semiacute (3. 0 g/kg body weight intragastrically, days 7 to 12 of pregnancy), and chronic {{conditions}} (15 % ethanol in drinking water for 5 weeks before and during pregnancy) to assess whether embryo-fetotoxic actions of the drug involve oxidative stress effects. Effects were monitored both in the maternal system and embryo. Alcohol compromised the maternal system by increasing the generation of lipid peroxides in the liver. It also decreased glutathione and vitamin E levels, and glutathione peroxidase and superoxide dismutase activities in this organ. Glutathione peroxidase activity in the maternal blood decreased. Only minor alcohol-induced changes occurred in the uterine endometrium, including decreased xanthine oxidase and increased gamma-glutamyl transpeptidase. Similarly, only few changes were induced in day- 12 embryos by alcohol. In this case, glutathione content and xanthine oxidase activity decreased while glutathione reductase activity increased following exposure to the chronic regime. With {{the possible exception of}} the maternal liver where evidence of oxidative damage was detected, these results do not reflect substantial changes in the antioxidant defences of either the pregnant mouse or embryo. However, the changes may contribute to the growth retarding and other <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of alcohol when they are totalled into the multifactorial actions of the drug...|$|R
40|$|Toluene is {{a widely}} used {{industrial}} solvent, and humans may also have high exposures to toluene from the deliberate inhalation ("sniffing") of paint reducer, paint thinner, or paint for their narcotic effects. A number of case reports describe neonatal effects that {{have been attributed to}} toluene abuse during pregnancy. These effects may include intrauterine growth retardation, premature delivery, congenital malformations, and postnatal developmental retardation. The possibility of exposures to other fetotoxic agents, either as impurities or admixtures in toluene-containing products, or by deliberate or accidental exposures to other chemicals or drugs, cannot be excluded in these cases. The <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects</b> of toluene have been demonstrated in controlled studies in animals and are comparable to those observed in humans who have abused toluene-containing products before or during pregnancy. Intrauterine developmental retardation is the most clearly established effect in animals, as evidenced by decreased late fetal weight and retarded skeletal development. There is also limited evidence in rodents for skeletal and kidney abnormalities, as well as some evidence for effects on postnatal physical and possibly neurobehavioral development. Estimated daily exposures from experimental studies in animals are compared to estimated human daily intakes at the occupational permissible exposure level and at the level reported to produce euphoria in humans. Acceptable human intakes under California's Proposition 65 and under U. S. Environmental Protection Agency procedures are discussed...|$|R
40|$|Heavy metals are omnipresent in the environment, and {{industrial}} use has greatly increased {{their presence in}} soil, water and air. Their inevitable transfer to the human food chain remains an important environmental issue as many heavy metals cause a range of toxic effects, including developmental toxicity. Administration of chromium VI (1 and 2 mg/kg as potassium dichromate) through intraperitoneal (i. p.) injection during organogenesis (days 6 to 15 of gestation) in rats revealed embryo- and <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects.</b> Reduced fetal weight, retarded fetal development, number of fetuses per mother and high incidences of dead fetuses and resorptions in treated mothers were also observed. Gross morphological abnormalities, such as displayed form of edema, facial defect, lack of tail, hypotrophy, severs subdermal haemorrhage patches and hypotrophy of placenta were observed in fetuses after chromium VI-treated mothers. A skeletal development of fetuses presented an incomplete ossification in nasal, cranium, abdominal or caudal bones in rats treated with 1 mg/kg of chromium, whereas rats treated with 2 mg/kg showed ossification and absence of the sacral vertebrae compared with the control. At a higher dose of chromium, histological changes were found in fetuses with atrophy of theirs vital organs. Placental histological observations revealed a pronounced morphological alteration, with atrophy of decidual cells, a degenerated of chorionic villi and hypertrophy of blood lacuna.

40|$|Kurt G NaberTechnical University, Munich, GermanyAbstract: This review evaluates 17 {{clinical}} studies from 18 selected publications concerning the safety, tolerability, and additional {{effects of the}} phytotherapeutic drug, Canephron&reg; N (CAN, containing the medicinal plants, Centaurium erythraea, Levisticum officinale, and Rosmarinus officinalis) as standard therapy in various clinical settings. Its role in the prophylaxis and treatment of urinary tract infections in adults and in children, therapy and prophylaxis in adult patients with renal stones, treatment and prevention of urinary tract infections and other gestational diseases in pregnancy, and also its safety and tolerability. The dosage was as recommended and over a varying duration. Overall, CAN was shown {{to be effective in}} the treatment and prophylaxis of UTI compared with standard therapy, both in adults and children, and there was a reduced number of relapses. Children undergoing surgical correction of vesicoureteral reflux benefited from a prophylactic course of CAN. Ten-day add on therapy increased the rate of spontaneous elimination of kidney stones compared with standard therapy alone and may also have had a positive effect on stone prevention. Pregnant women showed earlier relief of symptoms and normalization of pyuria on additional treatment with the herbal combination. Only one adverse effect was reported (skin rash) in the 3115 patients included in this review. No teratogenic, embryotoxic, or <b>fetotoxic</b> <b>effects,</b> or negative interference with the psychological development or health of children born of mothers treated with the drug were reported.

40|$|Surveillance of {{drug safety}} in {{pregnancy}} often draws on administrative prescription registries. Noncompliance {{in the use}} of prescribed medication may be frequent among pregnant women owing to their fear of <b>fetotoxic</b> side <b>effects.</b> To estimate compliance {{in the use of}} prescription drugs dispensed during pregnancy, we compared prescription data from the North Jutland Prescription Database with information on drug use provided by pregnant women to the Danish National Birth Cohort (DNBC), which is a health inter-view survey. We used the North Jutland Prescription Database to identify all prescription drugs dispensed during pregnancy for the 2, 041 women who were enrolled in the DNBC in the County of North Jutland, Denmark. Compliance was defined as the probability of reporting drug use in DNBC after purchasing a dispensed prescription drug. The overall compliance to drugs purchased within 120 days before the interview was 43 % (95 % confidence interval = 40 - 46). Drugs used for treating chronic diseases, for example, beta-blockers, insulin, thyroid hormones, and diuretic and antiepileptic drugs, were always reported to be used, but compliance was low for drugs used for local or short-term treatment such as antihistamines, antibiotics, antacids, nonsteroid anti-inflammatory drugs, and gynecologic drugs. Thus, for the latter drug groups the prescription database may provide an incomplete identification of exposure, Neither data source is unbiased regarding actual drug intake. Nevertheless, our results indicate that for some drug groups risk assessment studies based on prescription data may produce false negative results as a result of noncompliance...|$|R
40|$|Commonly used as flame retardants, polybrominated {{diphenyl}} ethers (PBDEs) {{are routinely}} {{detected in the}} environment, animals, and humans. Although these persistent organic pollutants are increasingly recognized as having serious health implications, particularly for children, {{this is the first}} study, to our knowledge, to investigate an intervention for human elimination of bioaccumulated PBDEs. Objectives. To determine the efficacy of blood, urine, and perspiration as PBDE biomonitoring mediums; assess excretion of five common PBDE congeners (28, 47, 99, 100, and 153) in urine and perspiration; and explore the potential of induced sweating for decreasing bioaccumulated PBDEs. Results. PBDE congeners were not found in urine samples; findings focus on blood and perspiration. 80 % of participants tested positive in one or more body fluids for PBDE 28, 100 % for PBDE 47, 95 % for PBDE 99, and 90 % for PBDE 100 and PBDE 153. Induced perspiration facilitated excretion of the five congeners, with different rates of excretion for different congeners. Conclusion. Blood testing provides only a partial understanding of human PBDE bioaccumulation; testing of both blood and perspiration provides a better understanding. This study provides important baseline evidence for regular induced perspiration as a potential means for therapeutic PBDE elimination. <b>Fetotoxic</b> and reproductive <b>effects</b> of PBDE exposure highlight the importance of further detoxification research...|$|R

In the present study ethylene glycol monoethyl ether acetate (EGEEA), ethylene glycol monobutyl ether (EGBE), and diethylene glycol monoethyl ether (diEGEE) were tested in the same experimental model, using distilled water as the negative control and EGEE as a positive control. Water or undiluted glycols were applied four times daily on days 7 to 16 of gestation to the shaved interscapular skin with an automatic pipetter. Volumes of EGEE (0. 25 mL), EGEEA (0. 35 mL), and diEGEE (0. 35 mL) were approximately equimolar (2. 6 mmole per treatment). EGBE at 0. 35 mL four times daily (approximately 2. 7 mmole per treatment) killed 10 of 11 treated rats, and was subsequently tested at 0. 12 mL (0. 9 mmole) per treatment. EGEE- and EGEEAtreated rats showed a reduction in body weight relative to water controls that was associated with completely resorbed litters and significantly fewer live fetuses per litter.

40|$|Introduction: The {{current number}} of women in the {{reproductive}} phase (from 15 to 45 years) in Europe is estimated at about 105 million, with about 5 million children annually born in average. About 1 % of pregnancies among women in Europe are complicated by heart disease, the risk of cardiovascular disease in pregnant women being further increased by the fact that ever older women are giving birth. Methods: Preparing this paper is based on a systematic PubMed search of existing professional databases and accessible medical journals and textbooks dealing with this subject matter. Topic: Being certainly drugs with the best anticoagulant effect in situations of high risk for thrombosis, especially in patients with mechanical prosthetic heart valves during pregnancy, vitamin K antagonists (VKA) on the other hand also entail a well-known dose-related risk of embryo toxicity, genotoxicity, and hemorrhage in the fetus and in the mother. The choice of appropriate anticoagulant depends on the stage of pregnancy. In accordance with the North-American guidelines (American College of Chest Physicians - ACCP) for women already on oral vitamin K antagonists actively trying to conceive frequent pregnancy tests, and substitution of VKA with heparin drugs when pregnant are recommended rather than VKA replacement with low molecular weight heparin (Low Molecular Weight Heparin - LMWH) when planning a pregnancy. Heparin derivatives have no embryo toxic and <b>fetotoxic</b> characteristic <b>effects</b> of VKA but they are less effective at preventing valve thrombosis, due to which they have recently been superseded by improved techniques for monitoring effects of heparin, with a mentioned made that low molecular weight heparin used in high therapeutic doses requires obligatory (on a weekly basis) monitoring of anti-factor Xa coagulation activities. Conclusion: Adequate anticoagulant therapy during pregnancy requires an analysis of risk factors for thrombosis, hemorrhage risk, consideration of comorbidities in pregnant women, especially renal function, especially taking into account the gestational age. Though it must be admitted that there is no absolutely safe anticoagulant therapy during pregnancy, a choice of the safest option regarding the stated risks for the mother and the child is of paramount importance...|$|R
40|$|PURPOSE: To provide {{information}} on the prevalence of use of cardiovascular drugs, {{some of which may}} have <b>fetotoxic</b> or teratogenic <b>effects,</b> in the outpatient setting among pregnant women in the United States. METHODS: A retrospective study was conducted using the automated databases of seven health plans participating in the HMO Research Network Center for Education and Research on Therapeutics (CERT). Women who delivered an infant from 1 January 2001 to 31 December 2005 were identified. Cardiovascular drug use was evaluated assuming a gestational duration of 270 days. RESULTS: During the period 2001 through 2005, 118, 935 deliveries were identified that met the criteria for study; 3. 1 % of women (N = 3672) were dispensed an antihypertensive medication and 0. 12 % of women (N = 146) were dispensed an antihyperlipidemic medication at any time during pregnancy. The most common antihypertensive drugs dispensed during pregnancy were nifedipine (1219 deliveries; 1. 0 %), methyldopa (961 deliveries; 0. 8 %), atenolol (593 deliveries; 0. 5 %), and labetalol (576 deliveries; 0. 5 %). Overall, 134 women (0. 11 %) received an angiotensin converting enzyme (ACE) inhibitor and 7 women (0. 006 %) received an angiotensin II receptor blocker (ARB) during pregnancy. Statins were the most commonly dispensed antihyperlipidemic drugs (71 deliveries; 0. 06 %). CONCLUSIONS: The prevalence of use of cardiovascular drugs that are suspected to be fetotoxic or teratogenic (ACE inhibitors, ARBs, and statins) was low in this cohort of pregnant women. Differing patterns of use across health plans suggests that {{further research is needed to}} evaluate the potential differential effects of cardiovascular drugs to assist prescribers and patients in making informed treatment decisions...|$|R
