5|$|On November 9, 2000, the WWF filed {{a lawsuit}} against the PTC in the U.S. District Court for the Southern District of New York, {{claiming}} that the PTC's statements were false and constituted defamation. The WWF also filed a copyright infringement lawsuit against the PTC for using clips from WWF programs in their promotional videos. The PTC filed for dismissal of the suit, but on May 24, 2001, U.S. district court Judge Denny Chin denied the PTC's motion on the basis that the WWF's lawsuit had merit. The PTC and the WWF settled out of court and, as part of the settlement agreement, the PTC paid the WWF $3.5 million USD and Bozell issued a public apology, stating that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> blame the World Wrestling Federation or any of its programs for the deaths of children and that the original statements had been based on what was later found to be false information designed by people close to the Lionel Tate case to blame the death of Tiffany Eunick on the WWF.|$|E

25|$|On September 14, Jean-Jacques Viseur (CDH), {{mayor of}} Charleroi, said that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> keep the socialists {{out of the}} government.

Hay Red Bell (born July 22, 1862 in Illinois; died November 16, 1917 in Missouri), a graduate of Moody Bible Institute. By November 1906 Wedge {{came to believe that}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> fight except in self-defense, and that he should devote his life to Christian service. Other factors in his decision to retire were that he may have been the loser of several of his more recent bouts, and was also remorseful over the death of an opponent in San Francisco. and was encouraged to do so by Prudence Tracy.|$|E

25|$|In 1969, the band's {{performance}} at the Woodstock festival introduced them to an international audience and garnered critical acclaim, although the band's sudden success {{put pressure on the}} group, highlighting the different musical directions in which Rolie and Santana were starting to go. Rolie, along with some of the other band members, wanted to emphasize a basic hard rock sound which had been a key component in establishing the band from the start. Santana, however, was increasingly interested in moving beyond his love of blues and rock and wanted more jazzy, ethereal elements in the music, which were influenced by his fascination with Gábor Szabó, Miles Davis, Pharoah Sanders, and John Coltrane, as well as his growing interest in spirituality. At the same time, Chepito Areas was stricken with a near-fatal brain hemorrhage, and Santana hoped to continue by finding a temporary replacement (first Willie Bobo, then Coke Escovedo), while others in the band, especially Michael Carabello, felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> perform publicly without Areas. Cliques formed, and the band started to disintegrate.|$|E
25|$|The {{format of}} the {{competition}} changed from 1954: 16 teams still competed in four groups of four, but this time each team played {{each of the other}} teams in its group at least once, without extra time {{in the event of a}} draw. Two points were awarded for a win and one point for a draw. If the first two teams finished on equal points then goal average would decide who was placed first and second. As in 1954, if the second and third placed teams finished on the same points, then there would be a play-off with the winner going through. If a play-off resulted in a draw, goal average from the group games would be used to determine who went through to the next round. If the goal averages were equal then lots would have been drawn. These arrangements had not been finalised by the time the tournament started and were still being debated as it progressed. Some teams complained that a play-off match, meaning three games in five days, was too much, and before the second round of group matches FIFA informed the teams that goal average would be used before resorting to a play-off. This was overturned when the Swedish Football Association complained, ostensibly that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> change the rules mid-tournament, but also because it wanted the extra revenue from playoff matches.|$|E
500|$|At a 1931 Bible Student {{assembly}} in Columbus, Ohio Rutherford proposed {{a new name}} for the organization, Jehovah's witnesses, to differentiate them from the proliferation of other groups that followed Russell's teachings. Bible Students who opposed or abandoned Rutherford to form new groups were increasingly described as the [...] "evil servant class" [...] by The Watchtower, which said <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> pray {{for those who were}} [...] "unfaithful". Four years later the term [...] "Kingdom Hall" [...] was introduced for the local meeting place of congregations.|$|E

500|$|Rather than {{discouraging}} the protesters, {{this event}} {{served as a}} catalyst for the movement. Within hours, news of the bombing had spread throughout the community. Around noon, nearly 4000 people marched silently to City Hall to confront the mayor. Mayor West met the marchers at the courthouse steps. Reverend C. T. Vivian read a prepared statement accusing the mayor of ignoring the moral issues involved in segregation and turning a blind eye to violence and injustice. Diane Nash then asked the mayor if he felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> discriminate against a person based solely on their race or skin color. West answered that he agreed it was wrong. Nash then asked him if he believed that lunch counters in the city should be desegregated. West answered, [...] "Yes", then added, [...] "That's up to the store managers, of course." ...|$|E
500|$|On April 22, 1915, an {{application}} for a commutation of Frank's death sentence was submitted to a three-person Prison Commission in Georgia; it was rejected on June 9 {{by a vote of}} 2–1. The dissenter indicated that he felt <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> execute a man [...] "on the testimony of an accomplice, when the circumstances of the crime tend to fix the guilt upon the accomplice." [...] The application then passed to Governor John Slaton. Slaton had been elected in 1912 and his term would end four days after Frank's scheduled execution. In 1913, before Phagan's murder, Slaton agreed to merge his law firm with that of Luther Rosser, who became Frank's lead attorney (Slaton was not directly involved in the original trial). After the commutation, popular Georgia politician Tom Watson attacked Slaton, often focusing on his partnership with Rosser as a conflict of interest.|$|E
500|$|Letters to Pennant {{from the}} parson-naturalist Gilbert White form {{the first part}} of White's 1789 book, The Natural History and Antiquities of Selborne. It is almost certain that the men were {{introduced}} by Gilbert's brother Benjamin White, Pennant's publisher; Gilbert seized on the opportunity to correspond, as a way of overcoming the intellectual isolation of Selborne in the absence of suitable learned societies at which he could read papers and share ideas. He knew that Pennant, with little skill or inclination as a field naturalist, was gathering observations to publish in his books; he quickly determined that he would make his own use of the correspondence, and kept copies of every letter he sent to Pennant. White was more careful than Pennant, and was sometimes critical; for example, in 1769 he objected that the goatsucker did not only make its sound while flying as Pennant asserted, so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> suppose that the noise must be made by the air beating against its [...] "vastly extended mouth". Pennant accepted White's criticisms graciously. Unfortunately Pennant's letters to White have been lost: White's Natural History begins with 44 of White's letters to Pennant, of which the first nine were never posted; the remaining 35 letters are dated between 4 August 1767 and 30 November 1780, covering topics as varied as whether swallows hibernate or migrate (letter 10), ring ousels (letter 20), whether peacock trains are really tails (letter 35), and thunderstorms (letter 44).|$|E
50|$|The antiphilosopher {{could argue}} that, {{with regard to}} ethics, there is only practical, {{ordinary}} reasoning. Therefore, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> a priori superimpose overarching ideas of {{what is good for}} philosophical reasons. For example, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> blanketly assume that only happiness matters, as in utilitarianism. This is not to say though that some utilitarian-like argument can’t <b>be</b> valid when <b>it</b> comes to what is right in some particular case.|$|R

500|$|Berridge {{defended the}} family, saying that Tahil's {{departure}} {{caused a lot}} of problems, however, she added, [...] "he Ferreiras have not been as successful as we had hoped. I think in retrospect we made a mistake in giving their entrance such a fanfare as a New Asian Family. Viewers traditionally {{take a long time to}} adapt to anyone new [...] so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>wrong</b> <b>to</b> emphasise what was different about this family from the start. Even so, we had a terrific first story for them, which was to have culminated in a huge, action storyline to mark the exit of their father. However, the sudden removal of actor Dalip Tahil, for reasons beyond our control, meant that the story had to be abandoned quickly – and 40 scripts rewritten on the spot. The result was the transplant story, which I have to admit did go on for far too long, especially when our biggest story in this period had also to be abandoned because of the pregnancy of Kacey Ainsworth. The writers and production team did their very best under these circumstances but I would be the first to admit the end result was not our finest hour. I hope that viewers will not hold this against the Ferreira family and will be prepared to watch the next stage of their stories with an open mind. This is a very talented bunch of actors, who've had to put up with a lot of stick for problems which have not been of their making. Viewer response to their lighter material was very favourable and I am confident the Ferreiras will regain their popularity." [...] Lorraine Heggessey, controller of BBC One, said the show became overdependent on the kidney transplant storyline as there were several cast problems, such as illness, pregnancy, rehab and a car crash. Berridge quit as executive producer of EastEnders and was replaced by Kathleen Hutchison.|$|E
