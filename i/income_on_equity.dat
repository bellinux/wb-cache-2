40|$|This paper uses a {{portfolio}} framework {{to evaluate the}} impact of increased noninterest <b>income</b> <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> market measures of return and risk of U. S. bank holding companies from 1997 to 2004. The {{results indicate that the}} banks most reliant on activities that generate noninterest income do not earn higher average equity returns, but are much more risky as measured by return volatility (both total and idiosyncratic) and market betas. This suggests that the pervasive shift toward noninterest income has not improved the risk/return outcomes of U. S. banks in recent years. ...|$|E
40|$|Seminars for useful comments. ** * The main {{portions}} of the paper {{that have not yet}} been performed and/or written up are: (1) the empirical results related to return volatility and credit ratings have been performed (and are entirely consistent with those presented) but not yet written up; and (2) some statistical tests have not been performed and all statistical tests do not incorporate the usual adjustments for clustering and heteroskedasticity. In this paper, we illustrate issues that arise in identifying conditional conservatism as asymmetry {{because of the presence of}} risky debt and mixed-attribute accounting for assets versus debt. 1 Conditional conservatism means that firms write down the book value of net assets in a relatively timely fashion upon receiving sufficiently bad news but do not write up net assets upon receiving good news, with the latter being the conservative behavior. Beginning with the seminal work of Basu (1997), most of the large and rapidly growing body of accounting research on conditional conservatism identifies its application by regressing net <b>income</b> <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> returns allowing for different slope coefficients on positive and negative returns. 2 Researchers use returns as the proxy for news because they are the most comprehensive and broadly applicabl...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate the materiality and volatility of comprehensive income for non financial firms in a non US environment. As the FASB and IASB are planning to require the reporting of comprehensive income in a single performance statement, it is important to resolve the issues surrounding the materiality and the volatility of comprehensive income. This study investigates the materiality of comprehensive income and its components in relation to total comprehensive income and closing equity for 37 non financial companies listed on the NZX from 2003 to 2008. Moreover, the cumulative impact of comprehensive <b>income</b> <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> over time is investigated. Further the volatility of comprehensive income is compared to the volatility of net income. This study also investigates the impact of the change to NZ IFRS on comprehensive income The results show that other comprehensive income is material in relation to total comprehensive income, but not in relation to closing equity. Moreover, some components of comprehensive income have a cumulative effect over time on closing equity. Comprehensive income is more volatile than net income. However, these findings are due to asset revaluations, which is the most dominant component of other comprehensive income. Though, all components of comprehensive income are significant for some firm year observations. Further, the move to NZ IFRS affects the materiality of some components of other comprehensive income and reduces the volatility of comprehensive income compared to net income. This study provides evidence that other comprehensive income is material for non financial firms in a non US environment. This suggests that it should be displayed clearly in the financial statement in order to be taken into consideration by financial statement users. Further, this study provides evidence that the difference in volatility between comprehensive income and net income in New Zealand can be avoided by choosing the cost method when measuring assets after recognition...|$|E

40|$|Effective {{measurement}} of financial performance for individual branch offices is hindered by two major problems. The first {{is an appropriate}} definition of profit; this is addressed through an economic-value accounting method which minimizes distortions due to the timing of <b>income</b> recognition. Return <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> is the basic profitability gauge used to compare results between profit centers. The second problem is that, in comparing results between branches, different levels of risk will produce an uneven chance of error in measuring true performance vs. reported results. This problem is addressed through techniques which equalize systematic risk (by implying an equity value) and non-systematic risk (through internal reinsurance), for each branch. To develop the internal reinsurance concept, a Poisson claim frequency and a Pareto claim severity model is constructed. Finally, in order to recognize the credibility of each profit center's actual experience, a canpromise is made to the equal-variance prin-ciple. The analysis concludes that branch office profit measurement is best served when the branch network has minimal variation in size and product mix...|$|R

Ordered-probit and descriptive statistics are used to explore the relationships between farm profitability and adoption of skill sets. ^ Due to several recent changes in the farm industry such as decoupled payments and trade liberalization; certain skill sets have become more important for both small and large farms. Most of these farmers are particularly susceptible to change because of the commodity nature of the industry, and failure to adjust could lead to disastrous results. Changes in the agricultural industry are expected to increase over the next twenty years at a rate unprecedented in modern agricultural history. ^ The skill sets which were explored include production management, procurement and selling, financial management, personnel management, strategic planning and relationship management skill sets. Independent skills were categorized into the skill sets used in the analysis after the survey was conducted. The measures of success which were used are growth of gross annual <b>income,</b> return <b>on</b> <b>equity,</b> profit in 2006, increase in net worth, and how successful the farmer felt his/her operation was from a financial perspective. ^ Descriptive and ordered-probit analyses yielded various results of which skill sets had the most affect on farm success. The adoption of skill sets proves to be more important in explaining the farm success in this study. The importance of the skill sets appears to be better explained by farm success {{rather than the other way}} around. Various demographics of the individual farm seem to be the most important factor in determining which skill sets are adopted and the farm success. ...|$|R

To manage risk, the global community is adopting the third generation of liquidity and capital requirements developed by the Basel Committee on Banking (the Basel III standards). There is no published study focusing on the implementation of Basel III in the Australian banking system. To fill this gap, this study develops a bank asset and liability management model using goal programming for one large Australian bank, to examine the implications of a progressive move to Basel III on key financial variables – net interest <b>income</b> (NII), return <b>on</b> <b>equity</b> (ROE) and return on assets (ROA) – to undertake a preliminary stress testing analysis of the bank after Basel III and to consider some of the governance and policy response issues involved.
