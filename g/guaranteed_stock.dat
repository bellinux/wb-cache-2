The present paper illustrates how the concepts of stochastic co-viability, which accounts for dynamic complexities, uncertainties, risk and sustainability constraints, can be useful {{for the implementation of}} EBFM. In the present case, this concept is used to identify fishing strategies that satisfy both ecological conservation and economic sustainability in a multi-species, multi-fleet context. Economic Viability Analysis (EVA) and the broader Co-Viability Analysis (CVA), are proposed to expand the usual Population Viability Analysis (PVA) and precautionary approach.

40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to analyze {{deterministic}} maturity guarantees. Such guarantees are embedded in modern individual pension products {{in order to protect}} the customer from downside investment risk. In particular, we focus on four issues: guarantee pricing, shortfall risk analysis, solvency requirements, and expected return. Other risk sources, such as mortality, early contract cancelation, or other problems such as hedging are left to further research. The first main contribution of this thesis is the implementation of a model with a stochastic volatility of the return rate of risky assets backing the guarantee. This constitutes the main difference to previous papers, which usually assume that the risky asset underlying the guarantee follows the geometric Brownian motion. We decided to use the Markov regime switching model introduced by Hamilton (1989) as it outperforms the linear and GARCH models. The use of the Markov switching model implies the incompleteness of the financial market. To address this issue we chose the Esscher martingale measure, which is well-known in actuarial science, in order to price the guarantee. This is the second main contribution of this thesis. Third, we proposed measuring the risk of the guarantee with several lower partial moments and conditional lower partial moments. In order to quantify the solvency capital, we proposed the mean excess loss. Furthermore, we have shown how risk managers can control the price and risk associated with a guarantee by making a suitable choice among several risk factors such as <b>guarantee</b> level, <b>stock</b> proportion, and time/contract term, or use a suitable investment strategy. Last, we have shown how to construct the so-called zero-bond investment strategy, which provides a costless/riskless guarantee...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{develops}} {{an interpretation}} of the Asian meltdown focused on moral hazard as the common source of overinvestment, excessive external borrowing, and current account deficits. To the extent that foreign creditors are willing to lend to domestic agents against future bail-out revenue from the government, unprofitable projects and cash shortfalls are refinanced through external borrowing. While public deficits need not be high before a crisis, the eventual refusal of foreign creditors to refinance the country's cumulative losses forces the government to step in and <b>guarantee</b> the outstanding <b>stock</b> of external liabilities. To satisfy solvency, the government must then undertake appropriate domestic fiscal reforms, possibly involving recourse to seigniorage revenues. Expectations of inflationary financing thus cause a collapse of the currency and anticipate the event of a financial crisis. The empirical section of the paper presents evidence in support of the thesis that weak cyclical performances, low foreign exchange reserves, and financial deficiencies resulting in high shares of nonperforming loans were {{at the core of the}} Asian collapse.
