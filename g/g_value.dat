2500|$|The glass {{panels in}} {{double-glazed}} windows transmit heat {{in both directions}} by radiation, across the panes by convection, and by conduction around the perimeter seals. The actual rates will vary with the conditions throughout the year, and while solar gain may be much welcomed in the winter (depending on local climate), it may result in increased air conditioning costs in the summer. The unwanted heat transfer can be mitigated by for example using curtains {{in the winter and}} using sun shades in the summer. In an attempt to provide a useful comparison between alternative window constructions the British Fenestration Rating Council have defined a [...] "Window Energy Rating" [...] WER, ranging from A for the best down through B and C etc. This takes into account a combination of the heat loss through the window (U value, the reciprocal of R-value), the solar gain (<b>g</b> <b>value),</b> and loss through air leakage around the frame (L value). For example, an A Rated window will in a typical year gain as much heat from solar gain as it loses in other ways (however the majority of this gain will occur during the summer months, when the heat may not be needed by the building occupant). This provides better thermal performance than a typical wall.|$|E

50|$|A common {{method for}} spin-trapping {{involves}} {{the addition of}} radical to a nitrone spin trap resulting {{in the formation of}} a spin adduct, a nitroxide-based persistent radical, that can be detected using EPR. The spin adduct usually yields a distinctive EPR spectrum characteristic of a particular free radical that is trapped. The identity of the radical can be inferred based on the EPR spectral profile of their respective spin adducts such as the <b>g</b> <b>value,</b> but most importantly, the hyperfine-coupling constants of relevant nuclei.
