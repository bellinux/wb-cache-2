25|$|In the 16th century, {{as part of}} {{a general}} {{expansion}} period for the Russian empire, missionaries were sent to the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of the empire, and several Russian Orthodox chapels were built on the Kola Peninsula.

25|$|The {{location}} of the Alley & McLellan shipyard in Polmadie, Lanarkshire, might appear perverse, as the yard was a considerable distance from the River Clyde, with the expansive final approach into Glasgow Central Station posing {{just one of many}} barriers between it and the Clyde. However, the company specialised in supporting the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of the British Empire by building vessels that were dismantled into kit form once they had been completed.|$|E
25|$|The {{status of}} the family {{is not easy to}} {{determine}} as many species live in the Amazon Basin or the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Andes and attract little attention, even from ornithologists. Moreover, their cryptic coloration and behavior means that their presence often remains unnoticed. A large proportion of the species are Amazonian, with the majority of these decreasing in range. Most, however, are surviving well enough so far to avoid being classified as threatened.|$|E
25|$|Though keeping Francis' {{remains in}} the Basilica of St. Francis, {{generally}} the Conventuals did not remain at the sites associated with Francis's actual presence except for the friary at Rivotorto.

After the founder's death, they began the task of translating Francis's earthly existence into a socially relevant spiritual message for current and future generations.|$|E

25|$|Peter Woodcock's prized {{possession}} {{was a red}} {{and white}} Schwinn bicycle on which he satisfied his continuing compulsion to wander. He rode the bike to the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of the city—even during the deep, cold Toronto winters—and evolved a fantasy in which he led a gang of 500 invisible boys on bikes called the 'Winchester Heights Gang'. His foster parents were aware of this fantasy and his compulsion to wander, but they were unaware that he had begun traveling around Toronto on his bike and sexually assaulting children.|$|E
25|$|The series' protagonist is an {{asthmatic}} 12-year-old boy, Arthur Penhaligon. The series {{begins on}} a Monday, {{with the main}} events starting a week later on the next Monday. Each book moves onto the next day of the week, {{over the course of}} about three weeks in Earth time, concluding on a Sunday. Each day features beings, collectively known as the Trustees, who each govern a portion of the House, which is the center of the Universe. The seven demesnes of the House are, in the order Arthur visits them: the Lower House, the <b>Far</b> <b>Reaches,</b> the Border Sea, the Great Maze, the Middle House, the Upper House, and the Incomparable Gardens.|$|E
25|$|While {{the power}} of a saint to offer a cure resided within a {{particular}} shrine which the patient must visit, health for Marcellus lay in the interconnectivity of the patient with his environment, the use he actively made of herbs, animals, minerals, dung, language, and transformative processes such as emulsification, calcination and fermentation. In the prefatory epistle, Marcellus insists on the efficacy of remedia fortuita atque simplicia (remedies that are readily available and act directly), despite the many recipes involving more than a dozen ingredients; in the concluding Carmen, he celebrates ingredients from the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of the empire and the known world (lines 41–67), emphasizing that the Roman practitioner has access to a “global” marketplace.|$|E

25|$|Jeschonnek’s view of air warfare {{was also}} flawed. He {{believed}} in the quick war. To this end he advocated throwing in all personnel, even training instructors into short but intensive campaigns. He {{did not believe in}} retaining reserves of pilots or material. He also, like Ernst Udet, head of the Technical Department, favoured dive bombers. He insisted all aircraft should have the capability, which retarded the development of capable bombers like the Heinkel He 177, by complicating the design, thus delaying development and production. The lack of a heavy bomber denied the Luftwaffe the chance to hit Soviet factories in the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Urals and at least disrupt enemy production.|$|E

[...] Roman [...] "foodies" [...] indulged in wild game, fowl such as peacock and flamingo, large fish (mullet was especially prized), and shellfish.

500|$|BART {{could be}} {{characterized}} as a [...] "commuter subway," [...] since it has many characteristics of a regional commuter rail service, somewhat similar to S-Bahn services in Germany, Denmark, Austria and Switzerland, such as lengthy lines that extend to the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of suburbia, with significant distances between stations. [...] BART also possesses some of the qualities of a metro system in the urban areas of San Francisco and Oakland; where multiple lines converge, it takes {{on the characteristics of}} an urban metro, including short headways and transfer opportunities to other lines. Urban stations are as close as [...] apart, and have combined 2½- to 5-minute service intervals at peak times.|$|E
500|$|In pre-Islamic Middle Persian (Zoroastrian) literature, Alexander is {{referred}} to by the epithet gujastak, meaning [...] "accursed", and is accused of destroying temples and burning the sacred texts of Zoroastrianism. In Sunni Islamic Persia, {{under the influence of}} the Alexander Romance (in [...] Iskandarnamah), a more positive portrayal of Alexander emerges. Firdausi's Shahnameh ("The Book of Kings") includes Alexander in a line of legitimate Persian shahs, a mythical figure who explored the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of the world in search of the Fountain of Youth. Later Persian writers associate him with philosophy, portraying him at a symposium with figures such as Socrates, Plato and Aristotle, in search of immortality.|$|E

500|$|While the {{superimposition}} of Roman {{culture on}} the local population {{appears to have been}} unproblematic and thorough, the Celtic traditions did not disappear entirely, resulting in a fusion of Roman and local culture that characterized all aspects of society. Latin, the language of government and instruction, only gradually replaced the local Celtic dialects in everyday use. Local artworks and religious icons of the period exhibit influences of ornamental Celtic art, classical Greco-Roman art and even Oriental styles from the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of the Empire. [...] An important incentive for the local people to Romanize was the perspective of obtaining the various degrees of Roman citizenship and the rights conferred thereby, including the right to vote, to hold public office and to render military service.|$|E
500|$|The current {{resurgence}} {{is located}} {{close to the}} base of the Dolomitic Conglomerate at the head of a short gorge formed by headward erosion with subsequent cavern collapse. The morphology of the passages is determined by the rock strata in which they are formed. The streamway in the outer part of the cave system that is formed within the Dolomitic Conglomerate is characterised by shallow loops linking low bedding chambers, or tall narrow passages, known as 'rifts', developed by phreatic solutional enlargement of fractured rifts. The streamway in the inner part of the system formed within the limestone is characterised by deep phreatic loops reaching depths as much as , with the water flowing down-dip along bedding planes and rising up enlarged joints. In the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of the cave the passages descend to [...] below sea level.|$|E
500|$|To help {{preserve}} Hawaiian culture, Milton [...] "Shorty" [...] Bertelmann {{and his brother}} Clay established the nonprofit organization, Nā Kalai Wa‘a Moku o Hawai‘i {{on the island of}} Hawaii in 1992. Beginning in 1994, the two brothers helped construct Makali‘i, a 54-foot voyaging canoe, launching it in 1995. From February to May 1999, [...] "Shorty" [...] Bertelmann navigated Makali‘i to Satawal in a voyage known as [...] "E Mau [...] Sailing the Master Home". The voyage was to pay homage to master navigator Mau Piailug and to thank him for his teachings. Mau sailed home aboard Makali‘i as their honored guest. Makali‘i continued her 1999 voyage through half the length of Micronesia. She was the first Hawaiian voyaging canoe to visit the <b>far</b> <b>reaches</b> of Micronesia and her appearance stimulated interest in Micronesians in their own cultural history.|$|E
