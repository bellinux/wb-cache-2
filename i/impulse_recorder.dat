P. h. the estimated annual energy output of a wind driven plant of cut-in speed 8 km. p. h., swept area 30 sq. m. and overall power coefficient 12 percent is 1361 kWh. the estimated annual water output of a windmill of the WP- 2 type is 39, 940 kilolitres. These estimated values of water out put have been compared with the actual output of a WP- 2 windmill installed at the technical centre of the civil aviation department, New Delhi, and with the estimates made from the wind data recorded by a cup-contact anemometer with <b>impulse</b> <b>recorder</b> installed near the windmill...|$|E
40|$|An {{abnormal}} apical impulse {{has long}} been recog-nized in hypertensive cardiac disease. Beilin and Mounsey (1962) described in great detail {{the changes in the}} apical impulse occurring in a series of 25 hypertensive patients who had been brought into hospital with a view to treatment with hypotensive drugs. They showed that with the development of hypertensive cardiac disease, as demonstrated by the electrocardiogram and x-ray, there was an ab-normal prolongation of the apical impulse up to, or beyond, the second heart sound. They also stated that patients with borderline hypertrophy showed inconstant changes in the apical impulse while those without hypertrophy (as shown on the electrocardio-gram and chest x-ray) had an entirely normal impulse. The present paper is an extension of this work to determine the value of the apical impulse in deter-mining changes in left ventricular function at an earlier stage than indicated either by the electro-cardiogram or chest x-ray. SUBJECTS AND METHODS Studies were made on 47 patients (27 men and 20 women) with hypertension, whose ages ranged from 25 to 68 years, with an average of 51. Their height and weight were recorded and note was also made of their general physique. Four of them were acromegalic and another three had ischaemic heart disease as well. Their range of blood pressure was always measured at the time of recording the cardiac impulse. Careful clinical assessment of the position, amplitude, and form of the apical impulse was made. The apical impulse was then recorded with the <b>impulse</b> <b>recorder,</b> using a simultaneous phonocardiogram at the pulmonary area and an electro-cardiogram as reference tracings (Beilin and Mounsey...|$|E
40|$|SUMMARY A new {{technique}} for assessing implanted cardiac pacemaker {{function in the}} ambulant patient has been introduced and assessed. A modified portable electrocardiograph recorder is used to store 24 hours of electrocardiograms along with marker pulses indicating the timing of pacemaker <b>impulses.</b> The <b>recorder</b> detects this narrow impulse and records a wider marker pulse on a second channel. The false positive detection rate was estimated from recordings, each of 24 hours, taken from 10 patients. All of these patients were ambulant and none had a cardiac pacemaker. There was on average less than one false positive per 24 hours. When similar recordings were taken {{from a group of}} 15 patients with pacemakers, the average false positive rate in 13 of these patients was also less than one per 24 hours. In the two other recordings artefacts resulted in false positive rates of 28 and 960 per 24 hours. Failure to detect pacemaker pulses was confirmed in only one patient. In addition to determining the accuracy of pacemaker pulse detection, the clinical usefulness of this technique was assessed. Two patients had fixed-rate pacemakers and 13 had demand pacemakers. Of the latter, two patients had a total of three episodes of failure to sense, one patient frequently failed to capture, and six patients had episodes of inappropriate inhibition of th...|$|R

Of the latter, two patients had a total of three episodes of failure to sense, one patient frequently failed to capture, and six patients had episodes of inappropriate inhibition of the pacemaker, the number of episodes ranging from one to 21 in 24 hours. Paced complexes were easily identified even when they occurred as fusion complexes. The frequency of paced complexes was quantified in each patient and varied from 21 to over 100 000 impulses in the 24 hour period...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MScEng (Mechanical and Mechatronic Engineering)) [...] University of Stellenbosch, 2009. Percussion is a {{centuries old}} bedside {{diagnostic}} technique {{that is used}} to diagnose various conditions of the thorax and abdomen, among these, abnormalities of the liver. The physician taps the patient’s skin in the area of interest to determine the qualities or presence of the underlying tissue or organ, by listening to the generated sound. The research contained in this thesis views percussion as a system identification method which uses an impulse response to identify the underlying system. A design employing an electromagnetic actuator as input pulse generator and accelerometer as <b>impulse</b> response <b>recorder</b> was motivated and built. Tests were performed on volunteers and the recorded signals were analysed to find methods of identifying the presence of the liver from these signals. The analyses matched signals to models or simply extracted signal features and matched these model parameters or signal features to the presence of the liver. Matching was done using statistical pattern recognition methods and the true presence of the liver was established using MR images. Features extracted from test data could not be matched to the presence of the liver with sufficient confidence which led to the conclusion that either the test, apparatus or analysis was flawed. The lack of success compelled a further test on a mock-up of the problem – a silicone model with an anomaly representing the organ under test. Results from these tests showed that signals should be measured further from the actuator and the approach followed during this test could lead to the successful location of the anomaly and discrimination between subtle differences in the consistency thereof. It is concluded that further research should aim to first validate percussion as performed by the physician and increase complexity in a phased manner, validating results and apparatus at each step. The approach followed was perhaps too bold in light of the lack of fundamental understanding of percussion and the underlying mechanisms...|$|R
