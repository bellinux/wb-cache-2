5|$|Hańska {{wrote to}} Balzac {{several times during}} 1832. On 7 November she posted a seven-page letter filled with praise and flattery:Your soul embraces centuries, Monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts {{appear to be the}} fruit of long study matured by time; yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> that you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel that I have no need to do so. I know you through my own spiritual instinct; I picture you in my own way and feel that were I to set eyes upon you I should exclaim, 'That is he!' Your outward semblance probably does not reveal your brilliant imagination; you have to be moved, the sacred fire of genius has to be lit, if you are to show yourself as you really are, and you are what I feel you to be—a man superior in his knowledge of the human heart.|$|E
5|$|I {{had settled}} {{an affair with}} five gentlemen of that country who were each of them to raise a {{regiment}} of dragoons well mounted and well armed which I knew they could easily do for the men had horses and homes of their own, and were, to say the truth most of them, the persons who some time since robbed the late Bishop of Winchester's Park, and have increased in their number ever since. They go {{by the name of}} the Waltham Blacks (tho few of them live there) which is a most loyal little town...I once saw two hundred and upwards of these Blacks in a body within half a mile of my house. They had been running brandy. There was 24 customs officers following them who they abused heartily and carried off their cargo. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> there is no less than a thousand of them and indeed I believe they have now taken loyalty into their heads, and will I hope prove very useful.|$|E
25|$|Oz was {{not always}} a fairyland, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told.</b> Once it was much like other lands, except it was shut in by a dreadful desert of sandy wastes that lay all around it, thus {{preventing}} its people from all contact {{with the rest of}} the world. Seeing this isolation, the fairy band of Queen Lurline, passing over Oz while on a journey, enchanted the country and so made it a Fairyland. And Queen Lurline left one of her fairies to rule this enchanted Land of Oz, and then passed on and forgot all about it.|$|E

I said that my idea was to paint spontaneously and express what <b>I</b> felt. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> that this <b>was</b> not an acceptable idea in 'contemporary practice'.|$|R

25|$|Since {{the nuclear}} {{stalemate}} became apparent, the Governments of East and West {{have adopted the}} policy which Mr. Dulles calls 'brinkmanship'. This is a policy adapted from a sport which, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told,</b> is practiced by some youthful degenerates. This sport is called 'Chicken!'. It is played by choosing a long straight road with a white line down the middle and starting two very fast cars towards each other from opposite ends. Each car is expected to keep the wheels {{on one side of}} the white line. As they approach each other, mutual destruction becomes more and more imminent. If one of them swerves from the white line before the other, the other, as he passes, shouts 'Chicken!', and the one who has swerved becomes an object of contempt. As played by irresponsible boys, this game is considered decadent and immoral, though only the lives of the players are risked. But when the game is played by eminent statesmen, who risk not only their own lives but those of many hundreds of millions of human beings, it is thought on both sides that the statesmen on one side are displaying a high degree of wisdom and courage, and only the statesmen on the other side are reprehensible. This, of course, is absurd. Both are to blame for playing such an incredibly dangerous game. The game may be played without misfortune a few times, but sooner or later it will come to be felt that loss of face is more dreadful than nuclear annihilation. The moment will come when neither side can face the derisive cry of 'Chicken!' from the other side. When that moment is come, the statesmen of both sides will plunge the world into destruction.|$|E
500|$|In 1905–06, George, Prince of Wales, visited India {{and wrote}} to the King from Agra, [...] "In the evening we saw the Munshi. [...] He has not grown more {{beautiful}} and is getting fat. [...] I must say he was most civil and humble and really pleased to see us. [...] He wore his C.V.O. which I {{had no idea he}} had got. [...] <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> he lives quietly here and gives no trouble at all." ...|$|E
500|$|By this time, Stevens {{was in his}} {{seventies and}} in poor health; he was carried {{everywhere}} in a special chair. When Congress convened in early December 1865, Stevens made arrangements with the Clerk of the House that when the roll was called, {{the names of the}} southern electees be omitted. The Senate also excluded southern claimants. A new congressman, Ohio's Rutherford B. Hayes, described Stevens, [...] "He is radical throughout, except, <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told,</b> he don't believe in hanging. [...] He is leader." ...|$|E
5000|$|Driberg’s {{statement}} was echoed {{by one of}} the prisoners, who said: 'Under National Socialism <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to believe all that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told.</b> <b>I</b> <b>was</b> promised lots of things but the promises were never kept. But in America <b>I</b> <b>was</b> promised that <b>I</b> <b>was</b> on my way back to Germany. That promise was also broken. How do you now expect me to believe anything at all?' ...|$|R
5000|$|Taleb {{received}} an honorary doctorate from the American University of Beirut in 2016 and also gave a commencement {{address to the}} graduating class in which, describing his life, he stated: [...] I hesitate to give advice because every major single piece of advice <b>I</b> <b>was</b> given turned out to <b>be</b> wrong and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> glad <b>I</b> didn’t follow them. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to focus and I never did. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to never procrastinate and I waited 20 years for the Black Swan and it sold 3 million copies. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to avoid putting fictional characters in my books and I did put in Nero Tulip and Fat Tony because I got bored otherwise. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to not insult the New York Times and the Wall Street Journal, the more I insulted them the nicer they were to me and solicit Op-Eds. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>told</b> to avoid lifting weights for a back pain and became a weightlifter: never had a back problem since. If I had to relive my life <b>I</b> would <b>be</b> even more stubborn and uncompromising than <b>I</b> have <b>been.</b> One should never do anything without skin in the game. If you give advice, {{you need to be}} exposed to losses from it.|$|R

500|$|With {{no return}} address, Balzac {{was left to}} reply in the Gazette de France, {{with the hope that}} she would see the notice. She did not, but wrote again in November: [...] "Your soul embraces centuries, monsieur; its {{philosophical}} concepts appear to be the fruit of long study matured by time; yet <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> you are still young. I would like to know you, but feel I have no need to do so.

500|$|As well as Jeff Tracy, English-Canadian actor Peter Dyneley voiced the {{recurring}} character of Commander Norman, chief of {{air traffic control}} at London International Airport. His supporting character voices were typically those of upper-class Englishmen. Shane Rimmer, the voice of Scott, was cast {{on the strength of}} his performance on the BBC soap opera Compact. Meanwhile, fellow Canadian Matt Zimmerman was selected at a late stage in the process. The expatriate West End actor was given the role of Alan on the recommendation of his friend, Holliday: [...] "They were having great difficulty casting the part of Alan as they wanted a certain sound for him, being the youngest brother. David, who [...] a bit older than <b>I</b> <b>am,</b> <b>told</b> them that he had this friend, me, who would be great." ...|$|E
500|$|Direct {{evidence}} of the city's condition was provided when it was filmed on 12 May 1974 by a British television news team which included the veteran journalist Peter Snow, who was reporting for Independent Television News on the disengagement negotiations. His report was broadcast on ITN's News at Ten programme. According to The Times correspondent Edward Mortimer, [...] "viewers were thus afforded {{a panoramic view of}} the city, which had stood almost completely empty since the Syrian army evacuated it in 1967. It could be seen that many of the buildings were damaged, but most of them were still standing." [...] After it was handed over, [...] "very few buildings were left standing. Most of those destroyed did not present the jagged outline and random heaps of rubble usually produced by artillery or aerial bombardment. The roofs lay flat on the ground, 'pancaked' in a manner which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> can only be achieved by systematic dynamiting of the support walls inside." [...] Mortimer concluded that the footage [...] "establishes beyond reasonable doubt that much of the destruction took place after 12 May—at a time when there was no fighting anywhere near Kuneitra." ...|$|E

500|$|Maine Representative Nelson Dingley Jr. was McKinley's {{choice for}} Secretary of the Treasury; he {{declined}} it, preferring {{to remain as}} chairman of the Ways and Means Committee. Charles Dawes, who had been Hanna's lieutenant in Chicago during the campaign, was considered for the Treasury post but by some accounts Dawes considered himself too young. Dawes eventually became Comptroller of the Currency; he recorded in his published diary that he had strongly urged McKinley to appoint as secretary the successful candidate, Lyman J. Gage, president of the First National Bank of Chicago and a Gold Democrat. The Navy Department was offered to former Massachusetts Congressman John Davis Long, an old friend from the House, on January 30, 1897. Although McKinley was initially inclined to allow Long to choose his own assistant, there was considerable pressure on the President-elect to appoint Theodore Roosevelt, head of the New York City Police Commission and a published naval historian. McKinley was reluctant, stating to one Roosevelt booster, [...] "I want peace and <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> that your friend Theodore is always getting into rows with everybody." [...] Nevertheless, he made the appointment.|$|E
500|$|While {{dividing}} his time, Blackstone {{became an}} administrator at All Souls, securing appointment as accountant, treasurer and bursar on 28 November 1746. Completion of the Codrington Library and Warton Building, first started in 1710 and 1720 respectively but not built until 1748, {{is attributed to}} his work. In 1749 he became Steward of the Manors, and in 1750 was made Senior Bursar. Records show a [...] "perfectionist zeal" [...] in organising the estates and finances of All Souls, and Blackstone was noted for massively simplifying the complex accounting system used by the college. In 1750 Blackstone completed his first legal tract, An Essay on Collateral Consanguinity, which dealt with those claiming a familial tie to the founder or All Souls {{in an attempt to}} gain preeminence in elections. Completion of his Doctor of Civil Law degree, which he was awarded in April 1750, admitted him to Convocation, the governing body of Oxford, which elected the two burgesses who represented it in the House of Commons, along with most of the university officers. With this and with his continuing work at the university, Blackstone announced on 3 July 1753 his intentions to [...] "no longer attend the Courts at Westminster, but to pursue my Profession in a Way more agreeable to me in all respects, by residing at Oxford [...] to engraft upon this Resolution a Scheme which <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> may be beneficial to the University as well as myself", which was to give a set of lectures on the common law – the first lectures of that sort in the world.|$|E

2500|$|In 1921, Bartelme led an {{investigation}} {{to determine whether}} Vernon Parks, the captain of Michigan's baseball team and leading pitcher in the Big Ten Conference, had played baseball for Portland in the Pacific Coast League under the assumed name, Harold Brooks. Barthelme noted, [...] "This Brooks won 90 percent of his games <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told.</b> I have seen his picture and I am certain he is really Vernon Parks, our star pitcher. If the charges are true, {{there is no doubt}} that the University of Michigan will take drastic action." [...] Parks admitted to Bartelme that he had played for Portland and at the same time resigned from the Michigan team.|$|E
2500|$|Ledley {{was played}} in an {{unfamiliar}} role at left-back during his first month at Celtic, a position he had only previously played in once or twice. [...] Despite playing {{in an unfamiliar}} position, he concentrated on establishing himself in his new team, stating [...] "...if <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> {{to do a job}} for my team, I try to do it {{to the best of my}} ability", and he scored his first goal for Celtic against St Mirren in a 4–0 home victory in the SPL on 22 August 2010. [...] By the end of August, the arrival of Honduran left-back Emilio Izaguirre saw Ledley return to his more familiar midfield role.|$|E

2500|$|<b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> {{that the}} more you rehearse, the better you play. This is wrong. We often try to reduce the {{unforeseen}} to a controllable level, to prevent a sudden impulse that escapes our ability to control, yet also responds to an obscure desire. Let's allow improvisation to have its place and play its role. I think that the true interpreter {{is the one who}} improvises. We have mechanized the art of conducting to an awful degree, in the quest of perfection rather than of dream [...] As soon as rubato is obtained and calculated scientifically, it ceases to be true. Music making is something else than searching to achieve an accomplishment. But striving to attain it is beautiful. Some of Michelangelo's sculptures are perfect, others are just outlined and the latter ones move me more than the first perfect ones because here I find the essence of desire, of the wakening dream. That's what really moves me: fixing without freezing in cement, allowing chance its opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|Ahead of the 2009–10 season, Redknapp said of Modrić, [...] " [...] {{a hell of}} {{a player}} and a manager’s dream, so <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told.</b> He trains like a demon and never complains, will work with and without the ball on the field and can beat a defender with a trick or with a pass. He could get into any team in the top four and he’ll be even better this season." [...] On 29 August 2009, during Tottenham's 2–1 win over Birmingham City, Modrić was taken off injured with a {{suspected}} calf injury. The following day, it was confirmed that Modrić had sustained a fracture to his right fibula and was expected to be out for six weeks. He returned on 28 December in the London derby against West Ham United, which Spurs won 2–0 with an 11th-minute goal scored by Modrić using the leg he broke. He again scored in a home win against Everton on 28 February 2010, and in an away defeat against Burnley on 9 May.|$|E
2500|$|Bloom has {{appeared}} in numerous roles on television such as her portrayal of Lady Marchmain in Brideshead Revisited (1981). In 1996, she wrote, [...] "I still find it puzzling when <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>told</b> I played a manipulative and heartless woman; that is not how I saw her. Lady Marchmain is deeply religious, and her dilemma includes trying to raise a willful brood of children on her own, while instilling them with her rigid observance of the Catholic code. Sebastian is both an alcoholic and a homosexual, and from her point of view, {{he lives in a}} state of mortal sin. She has to fight for his soul by any means in her power, with the knowledge that her efforts may lead to his destruction. A born crusader, the Marchioness confronts her difficult choices head on; her rigidity of purpose, which I don't in any way share, is understandable in context. The aspect that rings most true is her sense of being an outsider, a Catholic in Protestant England. Not such a leap from being a Jew in Protestant England as one would imagine." ...|$|E
