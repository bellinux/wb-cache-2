25|$|Can {{there be}} {{anything}} more preposterous than an unknown tongue; {{and in this}} country either for want of books or inability to read, the great part of our congregations must be utterly ignorant of the meaning and sense of the public office of the Church. It may have been prudent, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> to impose a compliance in this matter with the insulting and reproachful demands of the first reformers; but to continue {{the practice of the}} Latin liturgy in the present state of things must be owing either to chimerical fears of innovation or to indolence and inattention in the first pastors of the national Churches in not joining to solicit or indeed ordain this necessary alteration. It would be nearly 200 years until Carroll's wish for vernacular language-liturgy was realized in the United States {{as a result of the}} Second Vatican Council.|$|E

"Had I had certainties to go upon I should assuredly {{have done}} so, but, {{as you will}} see when I tell you all I had learned, I had nothing but suspicions, and those of the vaguest, and <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> <b>I</b> might be {{altogether}} in the wrong." ...|$|R
60|$|The {{double doors}} were shut, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> locked, {{and with her}} own hands Irene drew the {{curtains}} over them. Near the open window, to {{which there was no}} balcony, stood a couch.|$|R

6000|$|... "Farewell, kind Mrs. Fairfax!" [...] I whispered, as I glided {{past her}} door. [...] "Farewell, my darling Adele!" [...] I said, as I glanced towards the nursery. No thought could be {{admitted}} of entering to embrace her. I had to deceive a fine ear: <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> it might now be listening.|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{ought to}} be thankful," [...] said Shirley, [...] "and not mock me. What could I do? How could I gauge your appetites or number your band? <b>For</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> {{there might have been}} fifty of you at least to victual. You told me nothing; and then an {{application}} to provision soldiers naturally suggests large ideas." ...|$|R

60|$|And so it proved; for {{the next}} morning, at five o'clock, I found myself {{on the road to}} York, mounted on a {{reasonably}} good horse, and with fifty guineas in my pocket; travelling, as it would seem, for the purpose of assisting in the adoption of a successor to myself in my father's house and favour, and, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> eventually in his fortune also.|$|R
60|$|Still, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> {{there might}} be other ways of scaling this mountain. I did not trust the Amahagger, who {{declared}} that none existed, since their local knowledge was slight as they never visited these northern slopes because of their fear of Rezu. Supposing that the enemy gained the crest and suddenly assaulted us in the rear! The thought of {{it made me feel}} cold down the back.|$|R

"I fancy {{you will}} find they are high-fliers," [...] he said when the pair had left to fetch a {{suitable}} table, for the night being very hot {{we were going to}} play on the stoep {{by the light of the}} hanging paraffin lamp and some candles.

60|$|Truly {{ours was}} a dreadful situation. Let the reader imagine it. Within {{a little more}} than forty-eight hours we were to be shot to death with arrows if an erratic old gentleman who, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> might be dead, did not turn up at what was then one of the remotest and most {{inaccessible}} spots in Central Africa. Moreover, our only hope that such a thing would happen, if hope it could be called, was the prophecy of a Kaffir witch-doctor.|$|R
60|$|All {{that night}} I heard them talking off and on--I, who lay awake plunged into new miseries. I {{was sure that}} some other dreadful thing had happened. Probably Dingaan's armies had {{destroyed}} all the Boers, and, if so, oh! {{what had become of}} Marie? Was she dead, or had she perhaps been taken prisoner, as Dingaan had told me would be done for his own vile purposes? <b>For</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> she might now be travelling under escort to Umgungundhlovu, as I was travelling to Natal.|$|R
60|$|But {{it touched}} my heart so {{forcibly}} {{to think of}} parting entirely with the child, and, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> of having it murdered, or starved by neglect and ill-usage (which was much the same), that I {{could not think of}} it without horror. I wish all those women who consent to the disposing their children out of the way, as it is called, for decency sake, would consider that 'tis only a contrived method for murder; that is to say, a-killing their children with safety.|$|R

60|$|After {{standing}} {{many years}} {{at the foot of}} the hill, the house was again removed in three portions, and was fashioned into three separate dwellings, which, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> are yet extant in Danvers.|$|E
6000|$|... "And {{where am}} I {{to find them}} in this house," [...] said Dame Gillian, [...] "where strange men run about one chamber at midnight, and devils, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> {{frequent}} {{the rest of the}} habitation?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Abandoning {{speculation}} as useless {{and taking}} my {{chance of being}} murdered where I lay, for after all Billali's followers were singularly like the men with whom we had been fighting and <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> might be animated by identical objects--I just went to sleep, as I can do at any time, to wake up {{an hour or so}} later feeling wonderfully refreshed. Hans, who when I closed my eyes was already asleep slumbering at my feet curled up like a dog on a spot where the sun struck hotly, roused me by saying: ...|$|R
60|$|I {{felt as if}} {{the whole}} man were a moral and {{physical}} humbug; his wonderful beauty of face, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> might be removable like a mask; and, tall and comely as his figure looked, he was perhaps but a wizened little elf, gray and decrepit, with nothing genuine about him save the wicked expression of his grin. The fantasy of his spectral character so wrought upon me, together with the contagion of his strange mirth on my sympathies, that I soon began to laugh as loudly as himself.|$|R
60|$|As to me, I was {{a little}} uneasy at the {{thoughts}} of taking them on board; <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> they were a gang of pirates at best, and what they might do <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> not, but <b>I</b> sent them this message, that though all their tale might be very good <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> yet that <b>I</b> must take so much time as to send an express to {{the captain of the}} other ship, to be informed of the truth of it; and that if he brought a satisfactory answer, I would send for them all on board.|$|R
60|$|Tow. I should betray my countrymen to suffer, {{not only}} worse indignities than those {{they have already}} borne, but, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> might give them up to general imprisonment, perhaps betray them to a massacre.|$|E

60|$|Our {{case was}} exactly thus, and had issued accordingly, <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>know,</b> {{if we had}} not been in a port where, we got {{immediate}} assistance, and that by a more than ordinary vigour in the management too.|$|E
60|$|Already my thirty {{thousand}} archers were marshalling, and having {{made sure that}} there was ample store of arrows and that all their gourds were filled with water, I set myself at their head while {{in front of me}} walked the two veiled guides. I looked upon them doubtfully, since it seemed dangerous to trust an army to unknown men who <b>for</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew,</b> might lead us into the midst of our foes. Then I remembered that they were vouched for by the holy Tanofir, my own great-uncle whom I trusted above any man on earth, and took heart again.|$|R
60|$|One hour, two hours, three hours, {{and then}} {{suddenly}} {{from the top of}} a rise the sight of the beautiful Mooi River winding through the plain like a vast snake of silver, and there, in a loop of it, the flat-crested koppie on which I had hoped to make my home. Had hoped!--why should I not still hope? <b>For</b> <b>aught</b> <b>I</b> <b>knew</b> everything might yet be well. Marie might have escaped the slaughter as I had done, and if so, after all our troubles perchance many years of life and happiness awaited us. Only it seemed too good to be true.|$|R
