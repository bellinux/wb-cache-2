5|$|Takumi {{felt that}} the best way to write a mystery with a good climax is to reveal various clues, and then pull them {{together}} into one conclusion, and not have multiple possible endings. He said that the biggest challenge with that was to make the gameplay and story work together; the goal was to make the player feel like they have driven the story forward themselves, with their own choices, even though the game is linear. He only spent little time on writing a backstory for Phoenix before writing the first game's story, and instead made up dialogue and developed Phoenix's personality as he went along. He came up with the partner character Maya because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more fun for players to have another character with them, giving them advice, than investigating on their own.|$|E
5|$|Christian Tuxen Falbe, a Danish marine officer, was in Paris in January 1839 {{on behalf}} of Crown Prince Frederik when Louis Daguerre {{revealed}} the art of daguerreotyping. Falbe informed the Crown Prince of a visit to Daguerre where he had {{seen some of the}} very earliest daguerreotypes, explaining how impressed he had been by the new process and how important <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> for art and science in Denmark. Shortly afterwards, he returned to Copenhagen with a camera and a couple of his own daguerreotypes for the Crown Prince who, believing them to be of scientific importance, deposited them with Hans Christian Ørsted, one of Denmark's most prominent scientists. As a result of Ørsted's own interest in photography, the new art took on rapidly: the daguerreotypist Mads Alstrup (1809–76) opened Copenhagen's first photographic studio in 1842; and by 1850 there were over a hundred studios in Copenhagen and many more in the provinces.|$|E

Armstrong had had doubts if he should start the 2005 Tour, but decided in February 2005 that he would race. His main rival Ullrich was happy with this decision, as <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a better race with Armstrong present.|$|E

25|$|Sun Quan {{considered}} that Cao Cao {{was still a}} threat in the north, so <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better {{for him to have}} more allies instead of creating hostility between him and Liu Bei. Besides, he was also worried that Liu Bei's men might not submit to him, so he rejected Zhou Yu's idea.|$|E
25|$|For Medical Tales Retold, Seluk draws comics about unusual or {{touching}} {{stories he}} gets through his email. These stories are about illnesses and injuries {{and can be}} sent in by doctors or patients. The concept of Medical Tales Retold came up in collaboration with Tapastic. After Seluk saw an artist illustrate personal love stories through Tapastic, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{a good idea to}} normalize unusual medical stories through humor.|$|E
25|$|In 1982, he met {{his second}} wife, Hadassah Freilich Tucker, while {{he was running for}} Attorney General of Connecticut. Hadassah Tucker's parents were Holocaust survivors. According to Washington Jewish Week, Lieberman called her for a date because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> {{interesting}} to go out with someone named Hadassah. (Hadassah {{is the name of the}} Women's Zionist Organization of America). Since March 2005, Hadassah Lieberman has worked for Hill & Knowlton, a lobbying firm based in New York City, as a senior counselor in its health and pharmaceuticals practice.

500|$|... "Bart's Inner Child" [...] {{was written}} by George Meyer and {{directed}} by Bob Anderson. It was Anderson's directorial debut on The Simpsons.

50|$|It can be {{seen from}} Holberg's {{correspondence}} that he was very conservative with money where <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> not be of any use; for example, he was against raising the wage of the pedagogues of Havrebjerg.|$|R

500|$|The {{episode was}} written by Ken Keeler, who had been {{watching}} a lot of Frasier {{at the time and}} had been assigned to write a Sideshow Bob episode and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> a good idea to mix the two. Pierce was cast as Sideshow Bob's brother, causing Pierce to joke, [...] "Normally, I would not do something like this. But how often do {{you get a chance to}} work with an actor like Kelsey Grammer and, more importantly, play his brother?" [...] While Sideshow Bob is addressing the crowd, a man near the back raises his hand and says [...] "probably"; he is also voiced by David Hyde Pierce, who had wanted to be a man in a crowd.|$|E
500|$|Gosford Park screenwriter Julian Fellowes {{contacted}} King {{to present}} ideas for a script, {{and according to}} the producer, [...] " [...] seemed to have the whole movie planned out in his head so we told him to go ahead and write it. Three months later, this incredibly impressive screenplay showed up on our desks." [...] Fellowes was immediately hired by him and Scorsese. Fellowes chose not to end the film at Albert's death because he was wary of copying [...] "the horror of biopics," [...] where there is simply an important event after important event. Believing it had been done before and that the audience was already familiar with that part of Victoria's history, <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> better suited for a television series or for another film.|$|E
500|$|In July 1980, Bill Lyon of The Philadelphia Inquirer {{wrote that}} many fans unfairly stereotyped McBride as a lazy player {{because of his}} bad knees and his low-key personality. McBride ran with a {{lopsided}} gait, which fans interpreted {{as a lack of}} effort. Lyon wrote that because McBride did not talk about his injuries a lot to the public, most people did not realize that his knee joint had significantly eroded and that he was [...] "essentially, a one-legged player." [...] Lyon said that McBride's Afro hairstyle and his isolated nature furthered the stereotypes that many fans held. McBride said that he had never been a man who showed much emotion, and <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> hypocritical if he tried to look more intense just to appease the fans.|$|E
50|$|An arrogant, power-hungry sadist, Psimon {{does not}} always kill his victims, but prefers to instill his opponents with fear. He once attempted, for example, to fire a nuclear missile at Canada, simply because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> terrify the world.|$|R

5000|$|Edith Massey {{was cast}} {{in the role of}} Big Ed, but died shortly after her screen test. Paul Bartel was uneasy about having her in the film because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> look too much like a John Waters film without John Waters.|$|R
500|$|The creature's {{appearance}} {{was inspired by}} {{an image of a}} woman with a henna-tattooed back that Kripke found on the internet. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> intriguing to have the villain's entire body tattooed. The actor who portrayed the djinnMackenzie Grayhad a shaved head, so special effects makeup artist Toby Lindala only used a minor prosthetic to cover Gray's eyebrows. Lindala found the tattoos to be a [...] "particular challenge" [...] because they were [...] "intricate designs". [...] The production schedule could not accommodate the six hours needed to apply the makeup each day, so the actor was booked with the condition that the make-up not be removed for four days. Gray's personal life was affected by this, as people on the street were scared by his appearance. Lindala was surprised that Gray was able to keep the tattoos undamaged outside of filming.|$|E
500|$|In 2009, Johnson began {{indicating}} {{interest in}} {{running for president}} in the 2012 election. In the April 20, 2009 edition of The American Conservative magazine, Bill Kauffman told readers to [...] "keep an eye out" [...] for a Johnson presidential campaign in 2012, reporting that Johnson {{had told him that}} [...] "he was keeping his options open for 2012" [...] and that [...] "he may take a shot at the Republican presidential nomination in 2012 as an antiwar, anti-Fed, pro-personal liberties, slash-government-spending candidate—in other words, a Ron Paul libertarian". [...] During a June 24, 2009 appearance on Fox News's Freedom Watch, host Judge Andrew Napolitano asked Johnson if he would run for president in 2012, to which Johnson responded that <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> inappropriate to openly express his desires before President Obama is given the opportunity to prove himself, but he followed up that statement by saying [...] "it appears personal freedoms are being shoveled out the window more and more." ...|$|E
500|$|... "I Am Furious (Yellow)" [...] {{was written}} by John Swartzwelder and {{directed}} by Chuck Sheetz. It was first broadcast on Fox in the United States on April 28, 2002. The episode's storyline was pitched by Simpsons writer Matt Selman. In the DVD audio commentary for the episode, he stated that Matt Groening, {{the creator of the}} series, would usually tell the writers about how he was the class clown and did not pay attention in school, and yet grew up to become very successful. After hearing this, Selman thought that if Groening went back to his school to talk about his career, it [...] " [...] the last message that a principal and the teachers would wanna hear." [...] Selman pitched the story because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> [...] "humorously infuriating" [...] to teachers. The episode was also partly based on some of the Simpsons staff members' experience with making internet cartoons, such as Queer Duck and Hard Drinkin' Lincoln, both of which were created by Mike Reiss.|$|E
5000|$|Margaret Thatcher {{recommended}} {{his appointment}} to a knighthood, which he declined reportedly because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> prevent him enjoying his retirement from political activity.

500|$|The actors' {{performances}} were praised by several critics. Carman thought McCormack and Messing worked [...] "nicely" [...] together, {{and called the}} supporting cast [...] "an asset". Kay Mcfadden of the Seattle Times also praised McCormack, Messing and the supporting cast as [...] "very funny". Robert Laurence of The San Diego Union-Tribune wrote: [...] "Messing and McCormack play wonderfully together, tossing lines {{back and forth as}} if they'd been at it for years, making their relationship quite believable. Sean Hayes, as the flamboyantly gay Jack, adds to the mix. Jack is flighty, temperamental, good-humored and highly likable." [...] A reviewer for USA Today said <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> nice to see Will have a [...] "full life of his own", and not just serve as a [...] "love-life adviser" [...] to Grace and Jack. [...] "I know it won't happen soon; NBC is so skittish about the so-called Ellen 'gay show' stigma, it's gone to Herculean lengths to avoid mentioning Will's sexuality. But a grace period can only last so long." ...|$|E
500|$|... "A New Day in the Old Town" [...] was co-written by {{consulting}} producer Akiva Goldsman and co-creator J.J. Abrams, with Goldsman also {{serving as}} director. In the DVD special features, actor Joshua Jackson explained {{the second season}} begins {{less than a day}} after the previous season's finale, [...] "so the characters have only just barely had a chance to catch their breath from all the madness in the first season, and launch right back into the second one". Co-executive producer Jeff Pinkner considered beginning the second season directly after first season's final scene between Olivia and William Bell, but changed his mind because <b>he</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> more interesting to show how Olivia's disappearance and reappearance affected the Fringe team, as well {{as the rest of the}} season. The scene between Olivia and Bell is consequently not shown until the season's fourth episode, [...] "Momentum Deferred". The premiere began the [...] "gun arc" [...] storyline, which commenced with Olivia hurtling out of her SUV and becoming too weak to control her gun during her physical recovery, and ended with the killing of the shapeshifter posing as Charlie Francis in [...] "Momentum Deferred".|$|E
500|$|... "Bart to the Future" [...] {{was written}} by Dan Greaney and {{directed}} by Michael Marcantel {{as part of the}} eleventh season of The Simpsons (1999–2000). It was the second episode of the series to show the Simpson family's life in the future, following the season six episode [...] "Lisa's Wedding" [...] that aired five years earlier in 1995. Three more future-set episodes have been released since [...] "Bart to the Future", the first being Future-Drama (season 16, 2005), second being [...] "Holidays of Future Passed" [...] (season 23, 2011) and third being [...] "Days of Future Future" [...] (season 25, 2014). Greaney's inspiration for [...] "Bart to the Future" [...] came from [...] "Lisa's Wedding". He and The Simpsons writer Matt Selman were sitting in Greaney's office one day, {{trying to come up with}} new episode stories, when they received the idea of making a companion piece to that episode. Greaney wanted to write an episode set in the future that focused on Bart instead of Lisa. <b>He</b> <b>thought</b> <b>it</b> <b>would</b> <b>be</b> interesting to explore how the future works out for [...] "a guy like Bart, who doesn't pay attention to school work and is all about being cool." ...|$|E
