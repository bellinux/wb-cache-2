40|$|The binding and {{internalization}} {{of a novel}} {{adrenocorticotropic hormone}} (ACTH) analog having a potent neuromodulating effect, <b>ebiratide</b> (H-Met(O 2) -GIu-His-Phe-D-Lys-Phe-NH(CH 2) NH 2), by isolated bovine brain capillaries, were examined. Metabolism of [5 - 1251 -His]ebiratide occurred during a 30 -mm incubation with bovine brain capillaries at 37 #{ 176 }C. In the presence of 20 mM EDTA, added to inhibit this metabolism, the medium, after 30 mm of incubation, contained 82. 3 ± 0. 5 % of the unchanged <b>ebiratide.</b> The total binding and acid-resistant binding of [1251]ebiratide increased with time and reached an equilibrium at about 1 5 mm. The total binding and acid-resistant binding at 30 mm (as the cell/medium ratios corrected with [14 Clsucrose) were 1 3. 07 ± 0. 86 and 5. 00 ± 0. 18,zl/mg of protein, respectively. The acid-resistant binding showed significant dependence on temperatur...|$|E
