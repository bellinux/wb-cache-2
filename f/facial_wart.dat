40|$|The {{complete}} {{nucleotide sequence}} of human papillomavirus type 41 (HPV- 41) has been determined. HPV- 41 was originally isolated from a <b>facial</b> <b>wart,</b> but its DNA has subsequently been detected in some skin carcinomas and premalignant keratoses (Grimmel et al., Int. J. Cancer, 1988, 41, 5 - 9; de Villiers, Grimmel and Neumann, unpublished results). The {{analysis of the}} cloned HPV- 41 nucleic acid reveals that its genome organisation is characteristic as for other papillomavirus types. Yet, the analysis indicates {{at the same time}} that this virus is most distantly related to all other types of human-pathogenic papillomaviruses sequenced thus far and appears to identify HPV- 41 as the first member of a new subgroup of HPV. The overall nucleotide homology to other sequenced HPV types is below 50 %. The closest other HPV type is represented by HPV- 18, sharing 49 % identical nucleotides. The typical E 2 binding sequence ACCN 6 GGT, found in all papillomaviruses analyzed to date, does not occur in the URR of the HPV- 41 genome. Modified E 2 binding sequences, as described for BPV 1 (Li et al., Genes Dev. 1989, 3, 510 - 526), are located in the domain proximal to the E 6 ORF. These are ACCN 6 GTT, AACN 6 GGT and the two perfect palindromic sequences AACGAATTCGTT...|$|E
40|$|ABSTRACT Introduction: Warts {{are common}} benign {{tumors of the}} skin. Warts, {{specially}} periungual, palmoplantar and facial are highly recurrent, and thus present a treatment challenge. We have decided to evaluate DPCP in treat-ing resistant and multiple <b>facial</b> <b>warts,</b> periungual and plamoplantar warts to assess {{the effectiveness of this}} alternative treatment modality. Methodology: Total 45 patients with recalcitrant <b>facial</b> <b>warts,</b> palmoplantar and/or periungual warts were included in the study. The DPCP solution of concentration 2 % for adults and 1 % for pediatric patients was applied on lesion to induce sensitization. I...|$|R

40|$|Background: <b>Facial</b> flat <b>warts</b> are a {{contagious}} {{viral disease}} {{that can cause}} disturbing cosmetic problems. Topical glycolic acid {{has been reported to}} be effective in dermatological treatment depending on the exfoliant capacity, but has not often been reported to be effective in the treatment of <b>facial</b> flat <b>warts.</b> Objective: The aim of this paper was to evaluate the efficacy and safety of glycolic acid 15 % topical gel plus salicylic acid 2 % in the treatment of recalcitrant <b>facial</b> flat <b>warts.</b> Methods: A total of 20 consecutive patients 7 to 16 years of age with recalcitrant <b>facial</b> flat <b>warts</b> were enrolled in this study. Patients having warts by the eye and lip regions were excluded from the study. A fine layer of face gel was applied to the treatment area once daily. Most of the participants had tried different treatments with no success. Assessments for the response and the occurrence of side effects were performed every two weeks at Weeks 2, 4, 6, and 8. Results: All the patients were clinically cured within eight weeks. Seven patients cleared in four weeks, and 13 patients cleared in eight weeks. No noticeable adverse events were related to the skin. Conclusion: Topical gel of glycolic acid 15 % plus salicylic acid 2 % is safe and effective when applied to <b>facial</b> flat <b>warts</b> once daily until clearance and may be considered as first-line treatment...|$|R

40|$|Imiquimod, an imidazoquinoline amine, is {{approved}} for the topical treatment of external anogenital warts induced by human papilloma virus. Several clinical trials have shown imiquimod {{to be an}} effective and safe drug for treatment of anogenital warts. Consequently, it was considered that imiquimod might be effective on warts caused by the same aetiological agent located on other skin areas. We describe the favourable outcome of a case of multiple facial verrucae in a human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) -infected patient treated with imiquimod 5 % cream. This is a promising finding which supports those of two previous reports. We feel that imiquimod could be used in HIV-infected patients with multiple <b>facial</b> <b>warts</b> in whom conventional therapies are ineffective or produce significant side-effects...|$|R
50|$|The Javan warty pig {{ranges from}} 44 to 108 kg in weight and from 90 to 190 cm long. Their pelage is red near the tip {{and a yellow}} or white color {{at the base of}} the hair. All members of this species have long manes on top of their heads that follow their spines down their backs to their rumps. The tail of the Javan pig has a tuft of long, red hairs at the end. The build of this animal is skinny legs and a large, oblong body. The most {{distinguishing}} feature of the males of Sus verrucosus is the three pairs of <b>facial</b> <b>warts,</b> the preorbital, infraorbital, and the mandibular, which is the largest. As the pigs age, the warts grow in size, so the eldest Javan pig has the largest warts.|$|R
50|$|The desert warthog is a stockily-built animal {{growing to}} an average length of 125 cm and weight of 75 kg with males being larger than females. It has a rather {{flattened}} head with distinctive facial paired protuberances ("warts") and large curving canine teeth which protrude as tusks. These are not present in juveniles but grow {{over the course of}} a few years. They are larger in males than in females. The body is sparsely covered with bristly hairs and a more dense region of hairs runs along the spine and forms a crest. The tail is long and thin and is tipped with a small brush of coarse hair. The general colour is mid to dark brown but the crest is sometimes whitish. The desert warthog differs from the bushpig (Potamochoerus porcus) and the giant forest hog (Hylochoerus meinertzhageni) in having <b>facial</b> <b>warts</b> and proportionately larger tusks.|$|R
40|$|Back ground: Verruca Vulgaris {{is one of}} the commonest skin {{diseases}} in dermatological practice. The clinical management of Verruca vulgaris is often challenging. Multiple modalities of treatment currently exist, but none of them is singularly effective. Aim: : comparative study between Cryosurgery and 40 % salicylic acid in the treatment of warts. Settings and Design: This was a randomized single blind prospective study Methods and Materials: The study was carried out for 12 months and it included 60 patients. Patients with genital <b>warts,</b> <b>facial</b> <b>warts</b> immunocompromised patients and pregnant females were excluded from the study. Statistical Analysis Used:chi square test (P= 0. 0000). Results: There were 60 cases of warts. Cryosurgery was used in 30 cases with complete clearance in 21 cases. 40 % salicylic acid was used in 30 cases with complete clearance in 5 patients. Conclusions: Cryosurgery treatment in warts was better when compared to 40 % salicylic acid. Key words: Warts,Cryosurgery, 40 % Salicylic acid...|$|R
40|$|Gammapapillomavirus (Gamma -PV) is {{a diverse}} and rapidly {{expanding}} PV-genus, currently consisting of 76 fully characterized human papillomavirus (HPV) types. In this study, DNA genomes of two novel HPV types, HPV 179 and HPV 184, obtained from two distinct facial verrucae vulgares specimens of a 64 year-old renal-transplant recipient, were fully cloned, sequenced and characterized. HPV 179 and HPV 184 genomes comprise 7, 228 -bp and 7, 324 -bp, respectively, and contain four early (E 1, E 2, E 6 and E 7) and two late genes (L 1 and L 2) the non-coding region is typically positioned between L 1 and E 6 genes. Phyloge- netic {{analysis of the}} L 1 nucleotide sequence placed both novel types within the Gamma -PV genus: HPV 179 was classified as a novel member of species Gamma - 15, additionally con- taining HPV 135 and HPV 146, while HPV 184 was classified as a single member of a novel species Gamma - 25. HPV 179 and HPV 184 type-specific quantitative real-time PCRs were further developed and used in combination with human beta -globin gene quantitative real- time PCR to determine the prevalence and viral load of the novel types in the patient 2 ̆ 7 s <b>facial</b> <b>warts</b> and several follow-up skin specimens, and in a representative collection, a total of 569 samples, of HPV-associated benign and malignant neoplasms, hair follicles and anal and oral mucosa specimens obtained from immunocompetent individuals. HPV 179 and HPV 184 viral loads in patients 2 ̆ 7 <b>facial</b> <b>warts</b> were estimated to be 2, 463 and 3, 200 genome copies per single cell, respectively, suggesting their {{active role in the}} development of com- mon warts in organ-transplant recipients. In addition, in this particular patient, both novel types had established a persistent infection of the skin for more than four years. Among im- munocompetent individuals, HPV 179 was further detected in low-copy numbers in a few skin specimens, indicating its cutaneous tissue tropism, while HPV 184 was further detected in low-copy numbers in one mucosal and a few skin specimens, suggesting its dual tissue tropism...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Chemical peeling is a skin-wounding {{procedure}} {{that may have}} some potentially undesirable side-effects. AIMS: The present study is directed towards safety concerns associated with superficial chemical peeling with salicylic acid in various facial dermatoses. METHODS: The study was a non-comparative and a prospective one. Two hundred and sixty-eight patients of either sex, aged between 10 to 60 years, undergoing superficial chemical peeling for various facial dermatoses (melasma, acne vulgaris, freckles, post-inflammatory scars/pigmentation, actinic keratoses, plane <b>facial</b> <b>warts,</b> etc.) {{were included in the}} study. Eight weekly peeling sessions were carried out in each patient. Tolerance to the procedure and any undesirable effects noted during these sessions were recorded. RESULTS: Almost all the patients tolerated the procedure well. Mild discomfort, burning, irritation and erythema were quite common but the incidence of major side-effects was very low and these too, were easily manageable. There {{was no significant difference in}} the incidence of side-effects between facial dermatoses (melasma, acne and other pigmentary disorders). CONCLUSION: Chemical peeling with salicylic acid is a well tolerated and safe treatment modality in many superficial facial dermatoses...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Costello {{syndrome}} (CS) {{is a rare}} multiple {{congenital abnormality}} syndrome, associated with failure to thrive and developmental delay. One of the more distinctive features in childhood {{is the development of}} <b>facial</b> <b>warts,</b> often nasolabial and in other moist body surfaces. Individuals with CS have an increased risk of malignancy, suggested to be about 17 %. Recently, mutations in the HRAS gene on chromosome 11 p 13. 3 have been found to cause CS. METHODS: We report here the results of HRAS analysis in 43 individuals with a clinical diagnosis of CS. RESULTS: Mutations were found in 37 (86 %) of patients. Analysis of parental DNA samples was possible in 16 cases for both parents and in three cases for one parent, and confirmed the mutations as de novo in all of these cases. Three novel mutations (G 12 C, G 12 E, and K 117 R) were found in five cases. CONCLUSIONS: These results confirm that CS is caused, in most cases, by heterozygous missense mutations in the proto-oncogene HRAS. Analysis of the major phenotypic features by mutation suggests a potential correlation between malignancy risk and genotype, which is highest for patients with an uncommon (G 12 A) substitution. These results confirm that mutation testing for HRAS is a reliable diagnostic test for C...|$|R
40|$|The common warthog (Phachocoerus africanus) is a {{relatively}} long-legged pig with noticeable curved tusks, a short neck and three pairs of <b>facial</b> <b>warts.</b> It has four recognized subspecies. The common warthog is a non-migratory ungulate living on the African savannah. It is a hindgut fermenter and predominantly dependent on high-quality foods. It prefers open areas for grazing but use bushes for cover. Warthogs prefer former bomas because of the nutrient enrichment that has occurred there and they also distribute their faeces close to their feeding grounds. Warthogs are a pioneer species {{when it comes to}} recolonizing abandoned bomas. Warthogs are bearers of several diseases harmful to livestock and are therefore often chased from active bomas. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate how active bomas influence the habitat choice of warthogs. The study was carried out in the Maasai Mara National Reserve and the adjoining Koyake group ranch, in august 2003 and May-June 2004, using well defined study areas; transects. Results showed that warthogs favour the transects farthest away from the bomas. Warthogs probably favour the security of grazing among other species in order to avoid being caught by predators. Other herbivores might also feed on plant species less attractive to warthogs and thereby allowing plant species that warthogs favour to grow...|$|R

Objective. To assess the efficacy of a low-dose oral isotretinoin {{in the treatment of}} plane warts. Patients and Methods. Thirty-one patients with recalcitrant <b>facial</b> plane <b>warts</b> were enrolled. A cumulative dose of 30 mg/kg for two months of treatment was calculated; this was equal to amean of 0. 5 mg/kg/day. Each patient was seen every two weeks during the treatment period. Response to treatment was either complete or no response. Patients with complete response were followed up monthly for four months to record the relapse rate. Results. Twenty-six patients completed the study; their ages range from 5 to 35 with amean ± SD 15. 28 ± 8. 51 years. Fifteen (57. 69 %) patients were females and eleven (42. 30 %) were males. Nineteen (73. 07 %) patients showed complete response and seven (26. 92 %) patients showed no response at the end of two months of therapy. The difference was statistically significant; P value < 0. 0001. Fifteen (78. 94 %) out of nineteen patients, who had complete response, were still free from warts at the end of four-month followup.
