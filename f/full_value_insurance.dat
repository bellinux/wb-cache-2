First, {{from the viewpoint of}} insurable interest, the policyholder must be able to change the beneficiary to anyone when transferring an insurance contract to the unrelated third party.

Using a general and stringent definition of “insurance” and a simple ecological-economic model, we derive the economic <b>insurance</b> <b>value</b> of ecosystem resilience and study how it depends on ecosystem properties, economic context, and the ecosystem user’s risk preferences. We show that (i) the <b>insurance</b> <b>value</b> of resilience is negative (positive) for low (high) levels of resilience, (ii) it increases with the level of resilience, and (iii) it is one additive component of the total economic value of resilience. ecosystem, economic <b>value,</b> <b>insurance,</b> resilience, risk, risk preferences...|$|R
