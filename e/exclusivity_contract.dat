40|$|We {{present a}} {{potentially}} benign naked exclusion mechanism {{that can be}} applied to sequential innovation; a non-patentable original innovation by the incumbent supplier fosters derivative innovation by rivals. In the absence of an appropriate legal framework, the original innovator 2 ̆ 019 s equilibrium <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> block subsequent efficient entry even if there is (leader-follower) competition in the contracting phase. However, the legal framework may maximize social welfare by imposing a ban on upfront lumps-sum payments in <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> (by all suppliers) combined with an outright ban on <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> by the derivative innovator. The former ban precludes the exclusion of socially beneficial derivative innovation by causing the incumbent supplier to resort to accommodation, rather than to pure exclusion, strategies. The latter ban complements the former by preventing inefficient or excessive derivative innovation...|$|R
40|$|It is well {{established}} that an incumbent firm may use <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> so as to monopolize an industry or deter entry.

40|$|We {{develop a}} {{theoretical}} model to examine advertising choices by producers in a differentiated product duopoly. The model includes the media (referred to as stations) that sell advertising space to producers and broadcast advertising messages to consumers. Producers and stations enter bilateral negotiations {{to determine the}} price of advertising space. We show that more differentiated media stations and improved effectiveness of primetime advertising yield higher levels of advertising and lower profit margins for producers as well as stations. In contrast, more differentiated product markets enhance the profitability of both {{the media and the}} product markets. We further examine the impact on advertising choices of stations offering <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts.</b> In the presence of <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts,</b> producers’ incentive to advertise is lower than without such contracts...|$|R

40|$|In {{the case}} of {{vertically}} differentiated products, Bertrand competition at the retail level does not prevent an incumbent upstream firm from using <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> to deter the entry of a more efficient rival, contrary to {{what happens in the}} homogenous product case. Indeed, because of differentiation, the incumbent’s inferior product is not eliminated upon entry. As a result, a retailer who considers rejecting the exclusivity clause expects to earn much less than the incumbent’s monopoly rents. Thus, in equilibrium, the incumbent can offer high enough an upfront payment to induce all retailers to sign on the contract and achieve exclusion. ...|$|R

Salimpour's efforts on patients' behalf began after he was informed by Providence Saint Joseph Medical Center that his patients could not be seen by any neonatologists from his practice.

40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the interaction between}} the market of premium contents and the next generation network industry. We assume structural separation between the network and service operators (platforms) and the comparative advantage of the service operators depends on the access to premium contents. On one side, we analyze the impact of the exclusivity of premium contents over the incentives to deploy NGNs, the performance of the operators market, and welfare. On the other side, we analyze what are the incentives of the providers of premium contents to offer <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> (to singlehome) in NGNs settings in which they can also sell directly to consumers. In this context, we show that exclusivity only occurs when the content is not highly valued by consumers. ...|$|R
40|$|<b>Exclusivity</b> <b>contracts</b> {{can help}} {{stations}} by providing brand-value {{that allows them}} to obtain higher proﬁts, relative to unbranded retailers. However, branded retailers may have a stronger negative eﬀect over its competitors’ proﬁts. It is not clear which one of these two eﬀects dominates (brand-value vs competition eﬀect). Therefore, the impact of exclusivity over the number of participants in the downstream market is not determined. In this paper, I empirically study the eﬀects of exclusivity agreements on competition in the Brazilian gasoline sector. In order to do so, I estimate an entry model of endogenous product-type choices using data of retailers’ locations and contract choices along with data from the 2010 Brazilian Census. I use my estimates to simulate entry decisions under two counterfactual scenarios: i) mandatory exclusivity and ii) no exclusivity...|$|R

The three sports networks remained in co-existence on the XM platform for several years. In 2005, the <b>exclusivity</b> <b>contract</b> with XM expired, and the satrad company renewed it under non-exclusivity, which allows XM competitor Sirius Satellite Radio {{to pick up the}} network as well.
