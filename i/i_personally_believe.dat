[...] "There are indications of a strong revival of Royalist sentiment amongst the French people, {{and it is very}} possible that the Prince of Malors may wish to ingratiate himself by any means with the French army. This sort of thing scarcely sounds like practical politics, but one has to bear in mind the peculiar temperament of the man himself, and the nation. <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that the Prince of Malors would consider himself justified in abusing the hospitality of his dearest friend in the cause of patriotism. At any rate, this is my view, and I am acting upon it. All danger from that source will now be at an end, for in an hour's time the Prince will be under the surveillance of detectives for the remainder of his stay in England." ...|$|E
5000|$|In January 2004, Darby {{provided}} 2 {{compact discs}} of photographs to Special Agent Tyler Pieron of the U.S. Army Criminal Investigation Command, who was stationed at Abu Ghraib Prison, triggering {{an investigation that}} led to the implication of several soldiers violating the Geneva Convention. Darby initially wanted to remain anonymous, and had been assured of anonymity — he and those implicated all served in the 372nd Military Police Company, but became known when the New Yorker published his name and when later Donald Rumsfeld named him during a Senate hearing. Darby had agonized for a month beforehand, but finally decided to blow the whistle on his former friends explaining [...] "It violated everything <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>believed</b> in and all I'd been taught about the rules of war."

Evidence is brought to us that a secret meeting took place between the Czar of Russia and the Emperor of Germany. From all the information which we have collected that meeting was possible. <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that it took place. A treaty {{is said to have}} been drawn up between them, having for its object the embroilment of England with Russia, and an alliance of Germany with Russia so far as regards her quarrel with England. We know that Germany is secretly mobilizing men and ships. We know that the ambition of the Emperor is to possess himself of the Colonies of Great Britain, if not actually to hold his court in London. We know that his jealousy of King Edward amounts to a disease. We know that he is a man of daring and violent temper, with an indomitable will and an unflinching belief in his own infallibility and the infallibility of his army and navy. We know that he has at least a dozen schemes for a sudden attack upon England, and mighty though the navy of Great Britain is, it is not in our opinion strong enough to protect her shore from the combined Baltic and German fleets and also protect her Colonies. England, through our friendship, has been warned. She proposes with most flattering alacrity the only possible counter-stroke--an alliance with ourselves. We must decide within twelve hours. The treaty lies upon my desk there. Upon us must rest the most momentous decision which any Frenchman within our recollection has been called upon to make. What have you to say, gentlemen?" ...|$|E

5000|$|Since the {{designers}} of Ultima Online wanted to provide freedom {{and sense of}} agency, {{it was important to}} allow players to act in a villainous role. The consequences of in-game criminality were adjusted over time, but maintaining the general commitment to player freedom. As explained by designer Raph Koster, [...] "Being safe from evil is, in my mind, an uneven tradeoff for the fact that you don't get to be heroes anymore, in that you can just opt out of fighting evil. It may be nobody wants to be heroes except when it doesn't count, when it isn't challenging, that people would rather fight 'pretend evil' than the real thing, but <b>I</b> don't <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that. <b>I</b> still think people are better than that." [...] Eventually, the Renaissance expansion created large areas of the game in which {{it was not possible to}} harm other players. A significant spike in account reactivation was attributed to this aspect of Renaissance.|$|R

This is the only event of which we can be sure. The reasons for this act remain unknown. As for the two other planes that would have crashed — one on the Pentagon, in Washington, and one in Pennsylvania — they resemble a macabre farce, in my opinion. Everyone knows that any airplane crash produces an abundance of debris. Yet no one has seen any debris at all at the Pentagon or Pennsylvania. <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> don't <b>believe</b> 60-tonne planes can simply vanish. It might be that what we witnessed on Sept. 11, 2001, was a simple act of state banditry of titanic proportions. The events of that fateful day provided the mafias surrounding George W.

5000|$|John Milkovich, {{elected in}} 2015 {{as a member}} of the Louisiana State Senate, was then Monds' attorney. He accused both DA Brown and the {{presiding}} judge in the case, Graydon K. Kitchens, Jr., of Minden in Webster Parish of serious legal errors in the case. Milkovich accused Judge Kitchens of trying to block testimony which would have cleared Monds, and he accused Brown and Monds' former wife, Shea, of plotting the killing of Thomas. The charge against Brown was quickly repudiated by James Bullers, who succeeded Brown as district attorney of Bossier and Webster parishes. In a rebuke of Milkovich, Bullers said, [...] "The theory was and is so ridiculous that it's almost unbelievable. <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that Milkovich is totally obsessed with Henry Brown.

After making the film, doing all the research, and meeting all the people, <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> that all prostitution laws harm the women that they claim to protect.

40|$|William Faulkner {{produced}} works post-World War I {{when the}} ideologies of individualism, fragmentation and the self flourished while Toni Morrison is still writing novels, {{coming out of}} the Civil Rights Movement and the Women?s Movement that churned out concepts of communities and the collective bringing about social progress.

Therefore, my summer research consisted of a comparative study between Faulkner?s Light in August and Morrison?s Paradise and the way they portrayed the pervasive theme of Christianity in their respective novels in addition to research into their biographies and backgrounds to draw any conclusions on if their actual life?s value system and system of beliefs aligned with what they wrote in their fictions...|$|R
5000|$|McAllester {{has also}} written on {{friendly}} artificial intelligence on his blog.

I think this will happen long before machines can program themselves leading to an intelligence explosion. The early stages of artificial general intelligence (AGI) will be safe. However, the early stages of AGI will provide an excellent test bed for the servant mission or other approaches to friendly AI ... If there is a coming era of safe (not too intelligent) AGI then we will have time to think further about later more dangerous eras.|$|E

50|$|The ruling Congress Party {{was divided}} on the Hindi issue. While Rajaji and his {{supporters}} stuck to their position, Sathyamurti and Sarvepalli Radhakrishnan were against it. They wanted Rajaji to make Hindi optional or to provide a conscience clause for allowing parents to withhold their children from Hindi Classes. Satyamurti also disagreed {{with the use of}} Criminal Law Amendment Act of 1932 against the anti-Hindi agitators. In a letter written to Mahatma Gandhi on 7 July 1938, he wrote:I personally believe that where a parent or guardian swears an affidavit before a magistrate stating his reasons that it is against his conscience that his boy or girl should learn Hindustani compulsorily, the child may be exempted. <b>I</b> <b>personally</b> <b>believe</b> very few parents or guardians will claim this exemption.
