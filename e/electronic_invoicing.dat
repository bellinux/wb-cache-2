Supplier resistance to e-invoicing has decreased from 46% in 2011 to 26% in 2012.

40|$|Electronic {{document}} handling {{was first}} used in the automotive industry in the early 1970 ’s, the way of communicating electronic {{at the time was}} concerned with the communication way of EDI (Hsieh, 2004). In the beginning of 2000 a new way of communicating electronic documents was introduced with the emergence of VAN-operators (Hsieh, 2004). This technology of communicating <b>electronic</b> <b>invoices</b> has shown to be less complex for the businesses than the previous EDI connections. The VAN-operators enable companies regardless of size, ERP, also known as Enterprise Resource Planning, system, formats or transaction volume to send and receive <b>electronic</b> <b>invoices.</b> The subject of <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> handling have become increasingly debated, mainly because of the legislations taking place all over Europe, and as well as the environmental impact by business transactions being sent by paper. The objective of this thesis is to examine the challenges, solutions and outcomes for companies switching to <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> handling. The data collected for the thesis is divided into two parts. The first part consist of information retrieved by previous literature as well as internet sources. The second part concerns the case studies conducted for the thesis in respect to our research questions. For this reason Scandinavian companies have been interviewed, with different precondition as in size, industry, transaction volume and IT structure. The findings from the first and second part have been analyzed and conclusion have been made, we suggest using a VAN-operators, which have shown to be the most appropriate alternative for companies that are implementing <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> handling. The result of this thesis {{can be used as a}} guideline for companies when considering a switch from manual to <b>electronic</b> <b>invoice</b> handling...|$|R
