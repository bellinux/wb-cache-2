500|$|Built in 3807 or 3806 BC, {{the track}} was a walkway {{consisting}} mainly of planks of oak laid end-to-end, supported by crossed pegs of ash, oak, and lime, {{driven into the}} underlying peat. The planks, which were up to [...] wide, [...] long and less than [...] thick, were cut from trees up to 400years old and [...] in diameter, felled and split using only stone axes, wooden wedges, and mallets. The length, straightness, and lack of forks or branches in the pegs suggest that they were taken from coppiced woodland. Longitudinal log rails up to [...] long and [...] in diameter, made of mostly hazel and alder, were laid down and held in place with the pegs, which were driven at an angle across the rails and into the peat base of the bog. Notches were then cut into the planks to fit the pegs, and the planks were laid along the X shapes to form the walkway. In some places a second rail was placed {{on top of the}} first one to bring the plank above it level {{with the rest of the}} walkway. Some of the planks were then stabilised with slender, vertical wooden pegs driven through holes cut near the end of the planks and into the peat, and sometimes the clay, beneath. At the southern end of the construction smaller trees were used, and the planks split across the grain to utilise the <b>full</b> <b>diameter</b> of the trunk. Fragments of other tree species including holly, willow, poplar, dogwood, ivy, birch, and apple have also been found.|$|E

50|$|The maximum {{accurate}} {{distance of}} wadcutters varies considerably with {{the shape of}} the front of the bullet. <b>Full</b> caliber <b>diameter</b> wadcutters are suitable for use only at short ranges, typically not being used at ranges exceeding 25 yards where accuracy is especially desirable. At distances beyond 50 yards, <b>full</b> caliber <b>diameter</b> wadcutters become highly inaccurate. On the other hand, SWC bullets can maintain high accuracy at ranges exceeding 100 yards. In general, semi-wadcutters having a partially rounded nose are more accurate than wadcutters having a flat-front profile. In contrast, flat-front profile wadcutters tend to have improved lethality for hunting or self-defense purposes.|$|R

50|$|A drive {{center is}} used in the driving end of the machine (headstock). It {{consists}} of a dead center surrounded by hardened teeth. These teeth bite into the softer workpiece allowing the workpiece to be driven directly by the center.

They are often used in woodworking or where softer materials are machined.|$|E
50|$|Permeability is {{measured}} in the laboratory by encasing a core plug of known length and diameter in an air-tight sleeve (the Hassler Sleeve). A fluid of known viscosity is injected into the core plug while mounted in a steel chamber. The samples are either <b>full</b> <b>diameter</b> core samples that are intervals of whole core cut, typically 6 inches long, or 1-in plugs drilled from the cores. The pressure drop across the sample and the flow rate are measured and permeability is calculated using Darcy's law.|$|E
50|$|For {{short range}} target {{shooting}} on ranges up to 50 meters (55 yd), aerodynamics are relatively unimportant and velocities are low. As {{long as the}} bullet is balanced so it does not tumble, the aerodynamics are unimportant. For shooting at paper targets, the best bullet is one that will punch a perfect hole through the target. These bullets are called wadcutters. They have a very flat front, often with a relatively sharp edge along the perimeter. The flat front punches out a large hole in the paper, close to, if not equal to, the <b>full</b> <b>diameter</b> of the bullet.|$|E
50|$|These, {{also called}} stinger rounds, {{consist of a}} number of rubber balls ranging from around 0.32 to 0.60 in in {{diameter}}, and are used for direct fire. The small diameter means that each ball contains far less energy than a baton round, but it also limits the range. Rubber slugs, used in 12 gauge firearms, consist of a fin stabilized <b>full</b> bore <b>diameter</b> rubber projectile. These are used for long range, accurate direct fire shots on individual targets.|$|R

50|$|The chosen new {{penetrator}} material, tungsten carbide, was {{too heavy}} at full bore to be accelerated to a sufficient muzzle velocity. To overcome this, a lightweight <b>full</b> <b>diameter</b> carrier shell (APCR) was developed to sheathe the inner high density core. However, the low sectional density of the APCR resulted in high aerodynamic drag. Instead, the British devised {{a way for the}} outer sheath to be discarded after leaving the bore. The name given to the discarded outer sheath was the sabot (a French word for a wooden shoe, also used to describe the standardized wood or paper-mache wadding around round shot in a smooth bore cannon).|$|E
50|$|Cast bullets {{require a}} longer bearing surface than {{jacketed}} bullets {{to maintain an}} equivalent alignment with the bore of the firearm; because the softer cast bullet can be more readily deformed. The most successful cast bullet designs have a round or flatened nose rather than a long, unsupported ogive. Bullet designs with a forward diameter designed to be supported on the rifling lands work best in barrels rifled with wide lands and narrow grooves like the 2-groove M1903-A3 rifles. Forward bearing surfaces of <b>full</b> groove <b>diameter</b> provide more effective alignment in barrels with wide grooves and narrow lands, provided the chamber throat is long enough to accept such bullets.|$|R

5000|$|These bullets are {{designed}} to penetrate deeply through muscle and bone, while causing a wound channel of nearly the <b>full</b> <b>diameter</b> of the bullet. These bullets {{are designed}} to penetrate deeply enough to reach vital organs from any shooting angle and at a far enough range. One of the hunting applications of the flat point bullet is large game such as bear hunted with a handgun in a [...]44 Magnum or larger caliber. More common than hunting is its use in a defensive [...] "bear gun" [...] carried by outdoorsmen. The disadvantage of flat point bullets is the reduction in aerodynamic performance; the flat point induces much drag, leading to significantly reduced velocities at long range.|$|E

5000|$|Maksutov's most {{well known}} {{contribution}} {{in the field}} of optics was made in 1941, when he invented the Maksutov telescope. Like the Schmidt telescope, the Maksutov corrects for spherical aberration by placing a corrector lens in front of the primary mirror. However, where the Schmidt uses an aspheric corrector at the entrance pupil, Maksutov's telescope uses a deeply curved <b>full</b> <b>diameter</b> negative meniscus lens (a [...] "meniscus corrector shell"). He published the design in 1944 in a paper entitled [...] "Новые катадиоптрические менисковые системы" [...] catadioptric meniscus systems.

5000|$|Electronic {{surveying}} instruments {{such as a}} total station allows the observer to measure the position of each diameter measurement {{and the length of}} the trunk section between each measurement. With most of the instruments, the diameter is determined by measuring the angle of azimuth between the opposite sides of the trunk. Laser-measured distances to the sides of the trunk representing the ends of the diameter and the included angle are used with the law of cosines to calculate the diameter. The Criterion RD 1000 has a special feature that allows the diameter to be measured through a visible display. These length and diameter values then can be used to determine the volume of the individual section. [...] Another technique is available for those who possess instruments that will measure horizontal angles. The following diagram shows how to measure diameter remotely using a laser rangefinder to shoot the distance {{to the middle of the}} trunk and a transit or compass or another device to measure the horizontal angle created by the diameter. Note that in this method, the measurer shoots to the middle of the trunk instead of either edge. Also, the <b>full</b> <b>diameter</b> does not have to be visible from the point of measurement. It is a common misconception that closer distances lead to errors because the measurer can’t see the <b>full</b> <b>diameter.</b> However, if the trunk is round, closeness is not a factor. In the diagram d = diameter, D = distance from measurer to middle of the tree, a = angle from the middle to the edge of the trunk. A variation of this method is to measure the complete angle taken up by the image of the trunk and divide it by 2 to get angle a.|$|E
50|$|According to the Laws of the Game, for {{a goal to}} be awarded, {{the ball}} must cross the goal line, with its <b>full</b> <b>diameter</b> behind the full width of the line.

In addition, German players claimed to have seen chalk dust, which would {{indicate}} it was not a goal. The English counter by saying that the back-spin put on the ball after hitting the crossbar could just as likely have caused the ball to bounce behind the line and then back out of the goal—as had happened in a later match between the two countries.

Due to their small diameter and complex and variable composition, conventional techniques have struggled to accurately count and phenotype EVs. Currently, EV characterisation using high-resolution flow cytometry is the most promising method when compared to other currently available techniques, due to it being a high-throughput, single particle, multi-parameter analysis technique capable of analysing a large range of particle diameters. Whilst high resolution flow cytometry promises detection of the <b>full</b> EV <b>diameter</b> range, standardisation of light scattering and fluorescence data between different flow cytometers remains an problem. In this mini review, we will discuss the advances in high-resolution flow cytometry development and future direction of EV scatter and fluorescence standardisation.
