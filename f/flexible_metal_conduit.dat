50|$|Liquidtight <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> (LFMC) is a {{metallic}} flexible conduit {{covered by a}} waterproof plastic coating. The interior is similar to FMC.|$|E
50|$|The SJ's {{supercharger}} {{was located}} beside the engine; the vertical driving shaft necessitated a redesigned exhaust manifold arrangement; originally this {{took the form}} of a one-piece eight into one Monel manifold that re-routed the exhaust away from the engine, outside the engine compartment and through a single hole in the right front fender. The eight port manifold was found to be prone to cracking and was quickly superseded by a second manifold arrangement that routed four branches through the right side panel of the hood and right front fender. At least one supercharged car retains its original eight port manifold while most can be recognized by the four exposed exhaust pipes encased within bright <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> tubes, a design which Cord registered as a trademark and used in his supercharged Cords and Auburns. The flamboyant external exhaust pipes were offered both as an option on new normally aspirated Model Js and retrofit to earlier Model Js.|$|E

5000|$|Rigid <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> (RMC) is a {{thick-walled}} threaded tubing, {{usually made}} of coated steel, stainless steel or aluminum.|$|R

50|$|Some {{types of}} <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> may {{also serve as}} a useful bonding {{conductor}} for grounding (earthing), but wiring regulations may also dictate workmanship standards or supplemental means of grounding for certain types. While <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> may sometimes be used as a grounding conductor, the circuit length is limited. For example, a long run of conduit as grounding conductor may have too high an electrical resistance, and not allow proper operation of overcurrent devices on a fault.|$|R

5000|$|A conduit {{system can}} be made {{waterproof}} or submersible. <b>Metal</b> <b>conduit</b> {{can be used to}} shield sensitive circuits from electromagnetic interference, and also can prevent emission of such interference from enclosed power cables. Non-metallic conduits resist corrosion and are light-weight, reducing installation labor cost.|$|R
50|$|Sometimes the {{fittings}} {{are considered}} sufficiently conductive to bond (electrically unite) the <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> to a <b>metal</b> junction box (thus sharing the box's ground connection); other times, grounding bushings are used which have bonding jumpers from the bushing to a grounding screw on the box.|$|R

50|$|During the 1962 riots, four-story Shoemaker Hall {{was under}} {{construction}}. Students took up construction materials, including loose bricks, <b>metal</b> <b>conduit</b> pipes, and a bulldozer to attack federal officers.

50|$|To {{reduce the}} {{possibility}} of CSST lightning damage: 1) Yellow-jacketed CSST should be bonded (connected to the electrical service panel’s ground bus) at its entrance into a building. Many local codes require this. 2) All CSST should be installed away from metal objects such as metal duct work, metal pipes, electrical wiring, metal beams, or <b>metal</b> <b>conduit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The actual {{cause of}} 80% of neon sign {{failures}} is the burnout {{of the high}} voltage electrical wires connecting the tubes inside of <b>metal</b> <b>conduits.</b> A very common type of neon sign is made from a formed metal box having a colored translucent face, called [...] "channel lettering". Newer channel letter signs are being replaced by high brightness LEDs.|$|R

50|$|Armoured cables {{with two}} rubber-insulated {{conductors}} in a <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> sheath {{were used as}} early as 1906, and were considered {{at the time a}} better method than open knob-and-tube wiring, although much more expensive.|$|R
5000|$|There {{are more}} than 25 {{businesses}} in West Lebanon. Industry includes Tru-Flex Metal Hose, which has made stripwound and corrugated <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> hose since 1962, and Dyna-Fab, which specializes in metal stampings and weldments.|$|R
50|$|A cloudbuster {{consists}} of an array of parallel hollow metal tubes which are connected at the rear {{to a series of}} <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> hoses which are equal or slightly smaller in diameter to the parallel tubes. Alternatively, the rear of the tubes are joined together to a single large diameter pipe and <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> hose. The open end of these hoses are placed in water, which Reich believed to be a natural orgone absorber. The pipes can be aimed into areas of the sky to draw energy to the ground like a lightning rod. The remains of one of Reich's cloudbusters can be found in Rangeley, Maine.|$|R
5000|$|Emil Witzenmann was {{considered}} the inventor of expansion joints. [...] In 1920, he applied for a patent for the first so-called <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> tube expansion joint, German Reichspatent No. 367 185, from 29 July 1920. From a technical point of view, this precursor of today's expansion joints is a large, pressure-tight <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> hose with a defined, restricted freedom of movement. In the 1930s, the 'metal hose' or 'flexible metal tube' principle {{was replaced by the}} metal bellows as the central functional element. This design principle - metal bellows with connection pieces - is still the structural basis of modern metal expansion joints today.|$|R
5000|$|Built between December 1945 and July 1948, the [...] "Babyface" [...] design {{reflected}} Baldwin {{steam and}} electric locomotive practice. The carbody rode on two massive articulated cast steel half-frames cast by General Steel Castings, linked {{at the middle}} with a hinged joint. Unpowered four-wheel trucks at each end guided the locomotive through curves for stability at speed. Internal wiring was passed through <b>metal</b> <b>conduits</b> exactly like those used on a steam locomotive, which proved troublesome in practice.|$|R
5000|$|Waveguides are <b>metal</b> <b>conduits</b> used {{to confine}} and direct radio signals. They are usually made of brass, but {{aluminium}} and copper are also used. [...] Most commonly they are rectangular, but other cross-sections such as circular or elliptical are possible. A waveguide filter is a filter composed of waveguide components.

50|$|With {{a history}} {{of more than one}} hundred years, metal hoses have given rise to other {{flexible}} line elements, including metal expansion joints, metal bellows and semi-flexible and <b>flexible</b> <b>metal</b> pipes. In Germany alone, there are about 3500 patents relating to metal hoses.|$|R
50|$|Since {{cartridge}} heaters {{are installed}} {{in a wide variety}} of machines, manufacturers must design the heaters to meet certain clearances. link The cartridge heaters might be terminated with the leads coming out straight, or in a right angle. Also, manufacturers must be careful that the leads are not exposed to temperatures higher than the maximum rating for the lead wire. In order to prevent lead wire damage from temperature, movement or contamination, the lead wire can be protected with a <b>metal</b> <b>conduit,</b> braided <b>metal</b> or silicone sleeves.|$|R
