The pledges were examined and approved by the jeweler Paul Wijkman, but once inspected and sealed, they were placed in the bank without further inspections. Duréel hired the wife of an ensign, Maria Eriksdotter, as a liaison. Maria Eriksdotter collected the boxes containing the pledges after they had been approved and brought them to her. Duréel emptied the boxes of their content, replaced them with worthless objects, and sealed them again using the forged seal of Wijkman.

When the islands were <b>given</b> <b>as</b> <b>security</b> for the princess's dowry, there seems reason to believe that it was intended to redeem the pledge, because it was then stipulated that the Norse system of government and the law of Saint Olaf should continue to be observed in Orkney and Shetland. Thus the udal succession and mode of land tenure (that is, absolute freehold as distinguished from feudal tenure) lingered to some extent, and the remaining udallers held their lands and passed them on without written title.|$|R

The hüccets refer to them as mōloviya/mōlōyia (ﻪﻴﻮﻠﻮﻣ) - undoubtedly derived from the Greek term omologia (όμολογία) - regardless of whether a document was in Greek or in some of the Slavic languages. Writing omologias in mixed milieus, with predominantly Christian population, shows that Muslim community sometimes accepted local customs and traditions of the zimmīs. They were influenced by local customs although there was open and more secure opportunity to register loans at kādī’s Shari’ah court...|$|R
40|$|WIINERIES AND WINE IN CENTRAL CHILE, 16 TH AND 17 TH CENTURIES This project {{provides}} an historic-cultural framework {{of wine in}} Chile, from 1541 until 1700, analysing the very heterogeneous features of its production, distribution and consumption, both internal and external. Current legislation and {{its ups and downs}} are also addressed throughout this study. The geographic space considered matches the space of the administrative area of the city of Santiago in that time, from the Choapa river to the Maule river. It includes the large wine production units currently determined: the Aconcagua, Casablanca, Maipo, Rapel and Curico valleys, and the northern area of Maule. Specific aspects have been highlighted within each theme, such as that of landowners – divided by gender - within the “production” theme, and that of women’s role in land transfer (heiress, legatee, endowed, buyer, seller and bequeather) within the “woman” theme. Within the “consumption” theme – including domestic – their role in feeding habits, in addiction, in the sanitary aspect and the liturgical aspect. Among the variables of the last aspect, their consequences (conventual vineyards, consumer centres, and state distribution and charities). Wineries and wine were part of plots of land, bequeaths, “obras pias ” foundations and dowries, and were also related to the forms of credit effective at the time. Thus, they were mortgaged, <b>given</b> <b>as</b> <b>security,</b> sold in instalments or with a portion of their value in lien; they influenced in the bond required in properties in order to request a ground rent on them, for which their owners had easier access to them. The price of vines and of the different types of wine throughout the time considered in the study was also studied, as also were the mechanisms and bodies –such as the Cabildo – that determined such price. It is expected that this project contributed to the analysis and understanding of our past by grasping knowledge of the elements present in the production of a good deemed to be significant, and which has been darkened by the interest that historiography has put in other aspects of the agricultural and livestock field, such as wheat and cattle by-products.

5000|$|Mrs Penelope Wilson pawned (or [...] "pledged") her BMW 318 {{convertible}} for £5000 to a two-person {{company called}} First County Trust Ltd (i.e. she <b>gave</b> her car <b>as</b> <b>security</b> {{for a loan}} of £5000). She had to pay £304.50 per month in interest (a 94.78% pa interest rate). There was also a £250 [...] "document fee", but because Mrs Wilson could not pay it, the fee {{was added to the}} loan. Six months later she had to redeem the car by paying the full amount of £7,327, or the car would be sold. She did not pay six months later. When the pawnbroker asked her for the money, instead of paying, she brought an action against him under the Consumer Credit Act 1974 to get her car back. Under s 127(3) an improperly executed consumer credit agreement - such as one where the debtor does not sign and the document does not contain all the prescribed terms of the agreement - is unenforceable by a creditor. Mrs Wilson argued that the £250 {{was not part of the}} credit under the agreement, and therefore where the document stated that £5250 was <b>given</b> <b>as</b> a loan, this was incorrect.

40|$|The {{companies}} that own {{nuclear power plants}} in Sweden are responsible for adopting such measures as are {{needed in order to}} manage and dispose of spent nuclear fuel and radioactive waste from Swedish nuclear power plants and to dismantle the plants. According to the law, the Financing Act, the reactor owners shall pay a fee on nuclear energy production in order to fulfil this responsibility. The fee is based on a probable cost for waste management for 25 years of operation of all NPPs. Besides paying a fee the reactor owners must also <b>give</b> guarantees <b>as</b> <b>security</b> for remaining costs. Cost increases such as consequences of major changes, disruptions etc. are covered via these guarantees. The calculations are based on the plan for management and disposal of the radioactive waste products that has been prepared by SKB. In order to include the influence of uncertainties and variations a new calculation method has been applied. The uncertainties have been dealt with by means of a statistical weighing-together of their influence on the costs. This method differs from the method used in earlier years when the uncertainties were dealt with as a percentage surcharge on the calculated costs. The result of the calculation is presented as a distribution function indicating the probability associated with a given total cost, i. e. the probability that the calculated cost will prove true. The future costs from 1998 onwards amount to SEK 44. 9 billion. The future costs are calculated in January 1997 price level. The fee has been the same, in average SEK 0. 019 /kWh, for twelve years, between 1985 and 1996. For 1997 the average fee is SEK 0. 011 /kWh. The reduction of the fee is due to that the fee can be based on a confident cost calculation and due to an increased rate of return on the funded fees...|$|R
