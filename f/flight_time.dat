The two flight attendants aboard were Linda Lord and Judith Durkin.|$|E
5|$|The {{flight was}} manned by {{a crew of}} nine, {{including}} six flight attendants and three flight crewmen. The flight crew was captained by 51-year-old Laureano Caviedes with 28-year-old first officer Mauricio Klotz and 45-year-old flight engineer Matias Moyano. At {{the time of the}} crash, Captain Caviedes had been employed with Avianca for over 27 years and had logged over 16,000 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time,</b> including over 1,500 in the 707. Caviedes had 478 hours of night flying experience in the 707 and had no record of any prior accidents. Copilot Klotz had been employed with Avianca for three years and had 1,837 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time.</b> Klotz had transitioned to the 707 the previous October and had logged 64 flight hours in the airframe, including 13 at night. Flight engineer Moyano had been employed with Avianca for over 23 years and had over 10,000 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time,</b> including over 3,000 hours in the 707 and over 1,000 hours of night flying in the same airframe.|$|E

5|$|On March 21, 1942, Davis {{enlisted in}} the United States Army in Lubbock, Texas, just after the US entry into World War II. On June 3, he was {{appointed}} an aviation cadet in the Army Air Corps. He was moved to Kelly Field in San Antonio, Texas for pre-flight training, which he completed in August. He was then moved to Jones Field in Bonham, Texas for primary flight training. During this training, {{he got his first}} 60 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> aboard a Fairchild PT-19 trainer aircraft. Then, he flew for another 74 hours during Basic Flight Training in Waco, Texas and a final stint of training aboard the T-6 Texan at Aloe Field in Victoria, Texas. On February 16, 1943, Davis completed his training and was commissioned as a second lieutenant in the US Army Reserve, and immediately ordered to active duty with the Army Air Forces. By this time he had accrued 314 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|The first officer, 27-year-old Stephanie Bellegarrigue, held a {{commercial}} pilot certificate and type ratings for Learjet and Cessna Citation 500. She {{was also a}} certified flight instructor.

5|$|Hiroshima was {{the primary}} target of the first nuclear bombing mission on August 6, with Kokura and Nagasaki as {{alternative}} targets. Having been fully briefed {{under the terms of}} Operations Order No. 35, the 393d Bombardment Squadron B-29 Enola Gay, piloted by Tibbets, took off from North Field, Tinian, about six hours' <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> from Japan. The Enola Gay (named after Tibbets' mother) was accompanied by two other B-29s. The Great Artiste, commanded by Major Charles Sweeney, carried instrumentation, and a then-nameless aircraft later called Necessary Evil, commanded by Captain George Marquardt, served as the photography aircraft.|$|E
50|$|The US Army ran {{an ongoing}} BMD program dating {{back into the}} 1940s. This was {{initially}} concerned with shooting down V-2-like targets, but an early study on the topic by Bell Labs suggested their short <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> would {{make it difficult to}} arrange an interception. The same report noted that the longer <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> of long-range missiles made this task simpler, in spite of various technical difficulties due to higher speeds and altitudes.|$|R

40|$|The {{honeybee}}s of South Africa, the Cape honeybee Apis mellifera capensis and the African honeybee Apis mellifera scutellata {{are separated}} by a zone of overlap situated mainly within the Great Karoo ecotone (Hepburn and Crewe, 1991). The exact nature of this zone of overlap is unclear, but neither subspecies appears {{to be able to}} increase its range, despite capensis’s ability to become a social parasite of other honeybee subspecies (Allsopp, 1992) and scutellata’s potential for invasiveness (Winston, 1992). This status quo (Hepburn and Radloff, 1998) may be due to an asynchrony of mating <b>flight</b> <b>times.</b> Here we test the hypothesis that scutellata and capensis have offset mating <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> by comparing the <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> of drones of the two subspecies at a single locality in Stellenbosch, Western Cape, South Africa...|$|R
5|$|In {{the days}} {{following}} the attack on Pearl Harbor, Roddenberry received a telegram with orders to attend Kelly Air Force Base, enlisting on December 18, 1941. Following the completion of boot camp, {{he was sent to}} Corsicana, Texas for pilot training by civilian instructors. He completed sixty hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> there, including thirty-two solo hours. In March 1942, he moved to Goodfellow Field (now Goodfellow Air Force Base) in San Angelo, Texas for basic flight training where he flew a Vultee BT-13 Valiant. Roddenberry graduated on August 5, and was commissioned as a second lieutenant.|$|E
5|$|On 15 March 1947, Brown {{reported}} to Glenview Naval Air Station in Glenview, Illinois, for Naval Flight Officer training. There, his enlistment ended 15 April and Brown reverted {{to the rank}} of midshipman, becoming the only African American in the program. Although he anticipated antagonism, he found the other cadets were generally friendly and welcoming. He found many of the black cooks and janitors hostile to him, however, possibly due to jealousy. Brown got his first <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> aboard a Stearman N2S trainer aircraft.|$|E
5|$|The 42-year-old captain, Michael Kling, held {{an airline}} {{transport}} pilot certificate and type ratings for the Boeing 707, Boeing 737, and Learjet 35. He also had Air Force experience flying the KC-135 and Boeing E-3 Sentry. Kling was also an instructor pilot on the KC-135E in the Maine Air National Guard. According to Sunjet Aviation records, the captain had accumulated a total of 4,280 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> (military and commercial) and had flown a total of 60 hours with Sunjet, 38 as a Learjet pilot-in-command and 22 as a Learjet second-in-command.|$|E

5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{ended up}} being used primarily to develop arresting gear and barriers, but were used operationally {{for a short time}} by at least one Texas-based United States Naval Reserve squadron as they transitioned to jets. Between them, the 30 production aircraft had only a total of 945 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time,</b> only 31.5 hours each. Some aircraft flew only six hours which was enough for little more than their acceptance flight and the flight to their ultimate disposition.|$|E
5|$|The first RAF trial CAM launch {{was from}} Empire Rainbow, at Greenock on the River Clyde on 31 May 1941; the Hurricane landed at Abbotsinch. Six CAM ships joined convoys in June 1941. When a CAM ship arrived at its destination, the pilot usually {{launched}} and landed {{at a nearby}} airfield to get in as much <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> as possible before his return trip. Pilots were rotated out of CAM assignments after two round-trip voyages to avoid the deterioration of flying skills {{from the lack of}} flying time during the assignment.|$|E
5|$|The <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> of {{the adults}} or imagines begins {{in the late summer}} to early autumn, but the date depends on the region and climate. The males hatch out earlier than females and create swarms which gather around the treetops. The females seek out leks and couple with the males on the {{uppermost}} shoots. Then the females search for suitable host trees, if possible choosing weak and dry wood. They orient on monoterpene hydrocarbon compounds, which weakened trees produce. When a tree is stressed through dryness or exterior injuries, the compounds pervade osmotic barriers and escape from the bark.|$|E

40|$|We propose {{an analog}} model for quantum gravity effects using {{nonlinear}} dielectrics. Fluctuations of the spacetime lightcone are expected in quantum gravity, leading to {{variations in the}} <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> of pulses. This effect can also arise in a nonlinear material. We propose a model in which fluctuations of a background electric field, such as that produced by a squeezed photon state, can cause fluctuations in the effective lightcone for probe pulses. This leads to a variation in <b>flight</b> <b>times</b> analogous to that in quantum gravity. We make some numerical estimates which suggest that the effect might {{be large enough to}} be observable. Comment: 15 pages, no figure...|$|R

5|$|The {{internal}} {{fuel capacity}} of the Ju 87D was raised to 800L (of which 780L were usable) by adding additional wing tanks while retaining the option to carry two 300L drop tanks. Tests at Rechlin-Lärz Airfield revealed it made possible a flight duration of 2 hours and 15 minutes. With an extra two 300L (80US gal) fuel tanks, it could achieve four hours <b>flight</b> <b>time.</b>|$|E
5|$|Training Check Airman Captain Dennis E. Fitch, 46, {{was hired}} by United Airlines in 1968. He {{estimated}} that, prior to working for United, he had accrued at least 1,400 hours of <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> with the Air National Guard. His total DC-10 time with United was 3,000 hours, of which 2,000 hours were accrued as a second officer, 1000 hours as a first officer, and 79 hours as a captain.|$|E
5|$|Two {{main reasons}} {{contributed to the}} cancellation. The XF-85's {{deficiencies}} revealed in flight testing included a lackluster performance in relation to contemporary jet fighters, and the high demands on pilot skill experienced during docking revealed a critical shortcoming that was never fully corrected. The development of practical aerial refueling for conventional fighters used as bomber escort was also {{a factor in the}} cancellation. The two Goblins flew seven times, with a total <b>flight</b> <b>time</b> of 2 hours and 19 minutes with only three of the free flights ending in a successful hookup. Schoch was the only pilot who ever flew the aircraft.|$|E
