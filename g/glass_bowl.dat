5|$|In {{the final}} game of the season, Toledo {{defeated}} the Arkansas State Indians 43–28 at the <b>Glass</b> <b>Bowl.</b> The Indians scored first on a 24-yard Troy Mabone touchdown run followed by a one-yard Neil Trotter touchdown run for a 7–7 tie {{at the end of the}} first. In the second quarter Trotter scored on a two-yard run and Mabone on a one-yard run before a 38-yard Kevin Meger touchdown pass to Rickey Isaiah and 33-yard Rusty Hanna field goal gave the Rockets a 24–14 halftime lead.|$|E

5|$|Before {{what was}} the second largest crowd to witness a game at the <b>Glass</b> <b>Bowl,</b> Toledo {{defeated}} the Bowling Green Falcons 19–13 to win the Peace Pipe. After a Rusty Hanna field goal gave the Rockets an early 3–0 lead, a pair of Erik White touchdown passes gave the Falcons a 13–3 halftime lead. However, the Toledo defense shutout the Bowling Green offense in the second half, and the Rockets came back to win 19–13. Points were scored in the third on a seven-yard touchdown run by Kevin Meger and a one-yard Troy Parker touchdown run. Hanna added a field goal in the fourth. The victory improved Toledo's all-time record against Bowling Green to 22–29–4.|$|E
5|$|In {{what was}} the Rockets' first all-time meeting against Navy, 14 {{unanswered}} points {{in the fourth quarter}} gave the Midshipmen the 14–10 win at the <b>Glass</b> <b>Bowl.</b> Toledo led 10–0 as they entered the fourth quarter with points scored on a 34-yard Hanna field goal in the first and on a six-yard David Andrews touchdown run in the third. Navy came back to win the game in the fourth on a pair of Jason Pace touchdowns. The first came on a nine-yard run and the second on a five-yard reception from Alton Grizzard. The loss effectively resulted in the Rockets failing to get a bowl bid as Central Michigan got the automatic MAC bid to the California Bowl due to having the tiebreaker over Toledo.|$|E
5|$|High-quality {{glass from}} Roman {{manufacturers}} in Alexandria and Syria was exported to {{many parts of}} Asia, including Han China. The first Roman glassware discovered in China is a blue soda-lime <b>glass</b> <b>bowl</b> dating to the early 1st century BC and excavated from a Western Han tomb in the southern port city of Guangzhou, which may have come there via the Indian Ocean and South China Sea. Other Roman glass items include a mosaic-glass bowl found in a prince's tomb near Nanjing dated to 67 AD and a glass bottle with opaque white streaks found in an Eastern Han tomb of Luoyang. Roman and Persian glassware {{has been found in}} a 5th-century AD tomb of Gyeongju, Korea, capital of ancient Silla, east of China. Roman glass beads have been discovered as far as Japan, within the 5th-century AD Kofun-era Utsukushi burial mound near Kyoto.|$|E

5|$|On {{the table}} are various {{other pieces of}} {{equipment}} that the natural philosopher would have used during his demonstration: a thermometer, candle snuffer and cork, {{and close to the}} man seated to the right is a pair of Magdeburg hemispheres, which would have been used with the air pump to demonstrate the difference in pressure exerted by the air and a vacuum: when the air was pumped out from between the two hemispheres they were impossible to pull apart. The air pump itself is rendered in exquisite detail, a faithful record of the designs in use at the time. What may be a human skull in the large liquid-filled <b>glass</b> <b>bowl</b> would not have been a normal piece of equipment; William Schupbach suggests that it and the candle, which is presumably lighting the bowl from behind, form a vanitas—the two symbols of mortality reflecting the cockatoo's struggle for life.|$|E
5|$|At {{the very}} least, archaeological {{evidence}} supports the claim in the Weilüe and Book of Liang that Roman merchants {{were active in}} Southeast Asia, if not the claim of their embassies arriving in China through Jiaozhi, the Chinese-controlled province of northern Vietnam. Roman golden medallions from the reigns of Antoninus Pius and his adopted son Marcus Aurelius {{have been found in}} Oc Eo (near Ho Chi Minh City), a territory that belonged to the Kingdom of Funan bordering Jiaozhi. Suggestive of even earlier activity is a Republican-era Roman <b>glass</b> <b>bowl</b> unearthed from a Western Han tomb of Guangzhou (on the shores of the South China Sea) dated to the early 1st century BC, in addition to ancient Mediterranean goods found in Thailand, Indonesia, and Malaysia. The Greco-Roman geographer Ptolemy wrote in his Antonine-era Geography that beyond the Golden Chersonese (Malay Peninsula) was a port city called Kattigara discovered by a Greek sailor named Alexander, a site Ferdinand von Richthofen assumed was Chinese-controlled Hanoi, but given the archaeological evidence could have been Oc Eo. Roman coins have been found in China, but far less so than in India.|$|E

30|$|The current {{analyses}} {{have also}} shown that the natron base-glass compositions of the Jebel Khalid fluted and petal-decorated glasses {{are the same as}} those of the undecorated bowls, and by this association we can contemplate the possibility that all the Jebel Khalid <b>glass</b> <b>bowls</b> were manufactured in Greece or the Aegean. At Rhodes, the so-called sagged bowls lack the internal grooves found on many Jebel Khalid <b>glass</b> <b>bowls</b> [42 : p. 147]. Although this could suggest a different source of bowls from those found in the Levant, the similarity at least of the basic glass composition between Greek/Rhodian examples and those from Jebel Khalid, Tel Anafa (Israel), and Gordion (Anatolia) to the east might indicate another possibility: that the glass was made in the same place, but was formed elsewhere from imported raw glass chunks, or, alternatively, that the blank bowls were made in one place, whereas the cutting was done at a later stage somewhere along the route of distribution.|$|R

However, Chinese records maintain that a Roman embassy, perhaps only a group of Roman merchants, arrived at the Han capital city Luoyang by way of Jiaozhi (northern Vietnam) in 166AD, during the reigns of emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. 161–180AD) and Emperor Huan of Han (r. 146–168AD).

2500|$|The Browns {{beat the}} Green Bay Packers 38–7 {{in their first}} preseason game, played before a crowd of about 10,000 at the Toledo, Ohio <b>Glass</b> <b>Bowl.</b> The Packers got out to an early 7–0 lead on their first drive, a 73-yard advance capped by a {{touchdown}} pass to Ted Cook. Cleveland responded with a touchdown from quarterback Otto Graham to end Dante Lavelli on the ensuing drive, tying the score. Cleveland's Alex Agase blocked a punt later in the quarter that set up a Lou Groza field goal on the first play of the second quarter. Lavelli caught another touchdown pass from Graham to give the Browns a 24–7 halftime lead. While Brown rested Graham {{for most of the}} second half of the game, the Browns built on their lead with an 87-yard rushing touchdown by rookie Don Phelps and another score by Rex Bumgardner. Phelps suffered a head injury in the game and did not remember making the run, the longest rush from scrimmage in team history to that point. He got X-rays after the game and spent two nights in the hospital after being diagnosed with a mild concussion. Brown was pleased with the team's performance after just three weeks of training camp, saying Phelps [...] "looked a knife cutting across the field".|$|E
