Both the UK <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> and the US Internal Revenue Service sought to tax him as a resident.

5|$|Smallpeice, {{with support}} from E. H. Carr who was then {{assistant}} editor of The Times, promoted the idea of employers deducting income tax from wages and passing it to Government directly rather than waiting for employees to do {{so at the end}} of the financial year. He introduced this idea to Paul Chambers, then on the board of the <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue.</b> The idea, which became the PAYE system, would be tested in 1940–1941 and introduced permanently in 1944. The system vastly simplified and increased tax collection during the latter stages of World War II, when Britain was in desperate need of funds.|$|E

The tax applied to legal documents, licences, newspapers, pamphlets and almanacs in the American Colonies, Quebec, Nova Scotia, Newfoundland, Florida, the Bahamas and the West Indian Islands.

5|$|However, the United Kingdom courts {{gradually}} {{adopted a}} single sufficient interest test for all prerogative orders. In R. v. Commissioners of Customs and Excise, ex parte Cook (1969), for example, the High Court used a sufficient interest test {{to determine whether}} an applicant had standing {{to apply for a}} mandatory order. Singapore followed the UK's move towards a uniform test for all prerogative orders. In Re Lim Chor Pee, ex parte Law Society of Singapore (1986), the Court of Appeal endorsed the sufficient interest test for mandatory orders. In that case, the Law Society of Singapore had applied for a mandamus (now known as a mandatory order) to ensure that the Disciplinary Committee heard and investigated all six charges levied against an advocate and solicitor. The Court, applying the decision of the House of Lords in R. v. <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> Commissioners, ex parte National Federation of Self-Employed and Small Businesses Ltd. (1981), held that the test for standing was whether the applicant had a sufficient interest in the subject matter, and not whether he or she had a specific legal right.|$|E

In December 2001, long-serving chairman Douglas Craig put the club and its ground up for sale for £4.5million, before announcing that the club would resign from the Football League if a buyer was not found. Motor racing driver John Batchelor took over the club in March 2002, and by December the club had gone into administration. The Supporters' Trust (ST) bought the club in March 2003 after an offer of £100,000 as payment for £160,000 owed in tax was accepted by the <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue.</b> Batchelor left having diverted almost all of the £400,000 received from a sponsorship deal with Persimmon to his racing team, and having failed to deliver on his promise of having ST members on the board. York failed to win any of their final 20 league fixtures in 2003–04 and finished bottom of the Third Division.

5|$|Somerset House {{was built}} by Edward Seymour, Duke of Somerset, regent of England from 1547 to 1549, {{demolishing}} three inns and {{the church of the}} Nativity of Our Lady and the Innocents in the process. After Somerset was executed in 1552, it became an occasional residence for Princess Elizabeth. When she became Queen in 1558, she returned part of the house to Seymour's family (with ownership passing to his son, Edward Seymour, 1st Earl of Hertford); the remainder was an occasional meeting place for the Royal Society. After Elizabeth's death in 1603, it was owned by Anne of Denmark, wife of James VI and I. The building was renamed Denmark House in commemoration of Anne's brother, Christian IV of Denmark. After James died in 1625, his body lay there intestate for a month. The building was taken over by Parliament in 1645 following the Civil War, renaming it back to Somerset House. It had an irregular series of owners and residents for much of the 18th century until it was demolished in 1775. The house was rebuilt as a series of government buildings. The Stamp Office, later to become the <b>Inland</b> <b>Revenue</b> was established in Somerset House in 1789. In the late 20th century, a number of art galleries were set up on vacant parts, including the Courtauld Institute of Art and the King's College London School of Law.|$|E
