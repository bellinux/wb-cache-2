5|$|Cal Poly Pomona's {{dominant}} landmark is a futurist-styled administrative facility {{known as}} the CLA Building which was designed by Antoine Predock and opened in 1993.

In 2013, the California State University Board of Trustees voted to demolish the building {{and replace it with a}} new academic/faculty complex because of severe seismic risks.|$|E
5|$|Romeo and Juliet {{may be the}} most-filmed play of all time.

The latter two were both, in their time, the highest-grossing Shakespeare film ever. Romeo and Juliet was first filmed in the silent era, by Georges Méliès, although his film is now lost. The play was first heard on film <b>in</b> <b>The</b> <b>Hollywood</b> Revue of 1929, in which John Gilbert recited the balcony scene opposite Norma Shearer.|$|E

5|$|The Foehls knew many <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hollywood</b> film industry, and {{a number}} of film stars stayed at the hotel.

5|$|Capcom's design {{philosophy}} for Marvel vs. Capcom 3 was {{to maximize}} gameplay depth and minimize complexity. According to Niitsuma, the development team sought {{to create a}} game that would reach out to longtime fans of the series, while simultaneously expanding their user base to those familiar with the characters, but perhaps not with fighting games in general. The urge {{to reach out to}} new players also stemmed from Marvel's recent success <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>Hollywood</b> film industry. Capcom's global head of production, Keiji Inafune, expressed interest in appealing to a worldwide audience. These ideas drove the decision to retool the fighting system, which was criticized in past iterations for being too complicated for casual players. These changes include the implementation of the three-button attack system from Tatsunoko vs. Capcom and the addition of Simple Mode. Unlike previous titles in the series, Capcom had no plans for an arcade release, and focused only on console versions for the PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360. When asked if Capcom was planning to release the game on other consoles, Niitsuma did not dismiss the possibility for a Nintendo Wii version; however, this ultimately did not come to fruition.|$|E
