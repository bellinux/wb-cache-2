25|$|The <b>grubber</b> is more {{commonly}} used in a similar play. The <b>grubber</b> kick is commonly performed when close to the in-goal area; the <b>grubber</b> kick causes the ball to roll along the ground which at times, makes the ball jump up into a perfect catching position, easier than catching a punt or other kick. The rolling on the ground gives chasers more opportunities to regather the ball, rather than waiting for the ball to fall back to earth. The rolling also slows down the ball, allowing the kicker to place the kick so that it comes to rest inside the in-goal area.|$|E
25|$|The <b>grubber</b> {{is used in}} {{this manner}} to prevent the {{opposing}} team from trying to regather the ball or to force a mistake if they do try. A <b>grubber</b> also ensures that the ball will fall {{in the field of}} play before going in to touch, which would result in a penalty otherwise. A punt in this situation is placed as close to the out of field line as possible, which gives the opposition little chances to regather.|$|E
5000|$|The outsiders' {{knowledge}} of the initial colonization effort is even more intriguing {{than that of the}} city dwellers. Not long after their arrival, animals suddenly began attacking the city, and have not stopped since. However, a number of colonists lived outside the city. Though they still found the planet incredibly harsh, they never suffered such attacks. The <b>grubbers</b> are their descendants. The two factions despise each other. The <b>grubbers</b> hate the city Pyrrans, or [...] "junkmen", for cutting them off from space and refusing to trade food or ore for scientific knowledge or advanced technology—particularly medicine. The junkmen hate the <b>grubbers</b> for thriving while they are dying.|$|R

25|$|Campese {{played in}} the one-off Bledisloe Cup Test in 1989 between Australia and New Zealand. The Test, which Australia lost 12-24, {{contains}} a Campese try. Australia's eightman Steve Tuynman took the ball {{from the back of}} a scrum and passed the ball to Nick Farr-Jones. Farr-Jones passed the ball to Campese, who stepped around John Kirwan causing him to slip over. Campese then passed to Farr-Jones who had looped him. As Farr-Jones and Campese were running down the sideline, and with Farr-Jones about to be tackled into touch, Campese pointed forwards signalling Farr-Jones to kick the ball forwards. Farr-Jones executed a <b>grubber</b> kick. Campese and All Blacks inside centre John Schuster were engaged in a sprint towards the ball. As Schuster tried to dive on the ball, Campese was able to kick the ball forwards and fall upon it.|$|E
25|$|Scotland started well in Bridgend with Wade Liddell {{giving the}} Bravehearts the lead after just 8 minutes. This try was {{converted}} by Gareth Morton. But things got bad as Wales pulled a try back through Richard Johnson, and then Danny Brough was sinbinned for dissent on 26 minutes. In {{the next ten}} minutes a Wales team minus Iestyn Harris, who failed a fitness test prior to the match, capitalised on Scotland's shortfall and scored two tries to create a 14–6 lead going into half-time. However, after the break the Scots immediately {{got back into the}} match, Danny Brough singlehandedly scoring a try after 70 seconds of the interval, and Jamie Benn a little later leeching on to a <b>grubber</b> kick. Mick Nanyn missed both conversions and so the scores were tied. On the 67th minute Scotland went in front, Nanyn converting his own try. And to seal a 21–14 victory Danny Brough scored a drop-goal. He would later get Man of the Match award.|$|E

In return they will reward him handsomely. Jason agrees, but only to get him back to the city. He knows that though the <b>grubbers</b> would keep their word, the first thing they would get from civilization would be weapons with which to make war on the city. He has a better idea, and shares it with Kerk along with the truth about the attacks.|$|R

25|$|Billy Slater {{opened the}} scoring {{on the first}} set of the second half, thanks to break by captain Cameron Smith who passed outside to Thurston who found Darius Boyd who raced down the {{sideline}} and found Slater in support as Kiwi fullback Kevin Locke loomed in defence. This gave Thurston another chance to convert and bring the score to 22–2. A charge-down by Ben Matulino and regather from Sonny Bill Williams led to New Zealand beginning attack at halfway. More potential attack from the Kiwis was defused easily by the Australians, until a New Zealand <b>grubber</b> gave possession back to the Australians. A flick offload from Josh Papalii led to a chip kick from Brett Morris, regathered and then re-kicked by Jarryd Hayne led to a sliding Morris try. A conversion by Thurston brought the score out to 28–2. Both teams were having issues with the geography of the ground, as Morris collided with the signage during his try and a flying Manu Vatuvei landed awkwardly on the concrete surrounding the field. Australia's control of the game led to the New Zealanders forced into defense of their own line, defusing Australia's attack but not managing any successful attack of their own. A near 100 metre try by Morris, thanks to a 70-metre intercept run by Hayne, and conversion by Thurston made the score 34–2 with eight minutes to go.|$|E
25|$|Australia weren't able {{to equal}} that feat despite another Anzac Test win in 2014. Later that year, Australia co-hosted the 2014 Four Nations with New Zealand. They {{took on the}} Kiwis in {{the second of the}} double-header clashes at Suncorp Stadium. However Australia's record against the Kiwis at the venue {{continued}} to be a negative one after another defeat made it three defeats in the past four meetings at the 'Cauldron'. This meant Australia were facing England in a must win game at AAMI Park in Melbourne. With many regulars missing, Sheens had to make decisions like naming an 18-year old in the team, who'd become the youngest player to play for Australia. Sione Mata'utia, aged 18 years and 129 days, eclipsed the previous record held by Israel Folau, since 2007, by 65 days when he played on debut for Australia against the 'Poms'. The match was headlined with controversy. In the last minute of the game, England put a <b>grubber</b> kick in the in-goal area, since they were desperate for a try as they were trailing by just four points. Australian fullback Greg Inglis had to force the ball dead due to incoming England attack but the video referees wanted to have another look and see {{whether or not it was}} Inglis or the incoming English winger Ryan Hall got the last touch on the ball. On the slow-motion replays it showed that Ryan Hall's right hand's little finger had put some downward pressure on the ball however in normal speed it was deemed 'inconclusive' by Australian officiating rules and therefore a NO TRY was given to the frustration of the English players and supporters but respect from Sheens and his Australian players. Had the try been awarded and England converted, it would have been Australia's first defeat to England since 1995, the first time they suffered back-to-back home defeats since 1970 and the first time they failed to qualify for a tournament final since 1954. In their final round-robin fixture they dominated proceedings against the Samoans, who had been causing trouble for England and New Zealand in the tournament, to advance to the final which was held in New Zealand. However they couldn't get revenge for their defeat earlier in the tournament as Australia lost 18–22.|$|E

5000|$|In short, if a Pyrran {{animal is}} not hungry {{and does not}} sense hostility, it will not kill. Jason proves this to the junkmen, first by having the <b>grubbers</b> safely handle one of the city's ultralethal species, then doing it himself.

2500|$|Australia scored {{their only}} try of the 1991 World Cup Final in the 26th minute. Campese's [...] "chasing" [...] played an {{indirect}} {{part in the}} lead-up to Australia's first try. Simon Poidevin recalls in For Love Not Money that, [...] "He [...] took a bomb near his own line, spun out of the defence and sprinted 60m before kicking ahead..." [...] Bob Dwyer records that, [...] "Tim Horan had chipped ahead in a marvellous counter-attack from his own 22, and Campese had chased the ball and forced a lineout in the corner." [...] Australia scored moments later off a rolling maul. Dwyer noted that, [...] "The key to the whole exercise was Horan's <b>grubber</b> kick. If it had gone into touch, England {{would have had the}} put-in." ...|$|E
2500|$|Despite {{a lack of}} {{game time}} during the 2005 Super 12 season—he was {{suspended}} for six weeks after being found guilty of trampling on fellow All Black Richie McCaw during the game between the Blues and Crusaders—Williams was chosen to start in the opening Test of the All Blacks season, a 91–0 rout of , during which he scored his second international try. His third came two weeks later, in the first Test against the touring British and Irish Lions, {{a game in which}} he dominated the line-out, winning the ball several times on the opposition's throw, most effectively in the 24th minute, when, having caught the ball on a Lions' defensive line-out, he spotted a gap in the opposing line, darted through it and, shaking off an attempted tackle by the Lions half-back, Dwayne Peel, drove over the goal-line for the All Blacks' first try of the match. He started in all three Tests against the Lions, and scored his fourth international try in the final Test, when Dwayne Peel fumbled a <b>grubber</b> kick from Luke McAlister, and Williams pounced on the loose ball in the in-goal area. He started in all four of New Zealand's matches in the 2005 Tri Nations Series and came close to scoring another try in the last game, against Australia, on his home ground, Eden Park, but, after winning the ball at an Australian line-out and making a 20-metre break, his attempted <b>grubber</b> kick was wayward. He did, however, create the second of wing Doug Howlett's three tries in the game when, from within the Australian 22, in front of the posts, he executed a fine cross-field kick that Howlett caught on the far right of Australia's in-goal area for an easy touch-down. In 2009 Williams released his biography [...] "Ali: Tall Book of Tales",It was during this time in which he spoke of an incident involving Clint Brown then TV anchor for 3 News who was stripped naked by Williams and members of the All Black team and had his eyebrows shaved off after becoming heavily intoxicated on a flight from South Africa to Australia.|$|E
2500|$|From this, Thurston {{was able}} to kick to Billy Slater, setting up the first four-pointer which Thurston also {{converted}} to make the score 8–2. A try attempt by Cooper Cronk was controversially [...] disallowed by the video referee, who ruled Isaac Luke {{had been able to}} stop the ball coming into contact with the in-goal grass while also giving New Zealand a penalty against Andrew Fifita for 'driving' Luke. Cronk didn't have to wait long to score though, as a few minutes later Darius Boyd got around Whare and raced down the wing before putting in a miss-kicked <b>grubber</b> which Cronk managed to find to go over and score despite a desperate Kevin Locke tackle. Thurston kicked his 3rd goal from 3 attempts to take the score out to 14–2. Thurston's conversion of Cronk's try saw him overtake Michael Cronin as Australia's highest point scorer in test match football. Manu Vatuvei's attacking run for New Zealand saw him pushed over the sideline 5 metres out by 5 desperate Australian defenders, and an offside penalty at the 35 minute mark gave Thurston another kick to bring the score out to 16–2 at halftime.|$|E
50|$|Jason {{realizes the}} nature of the conflict. But he needs to tell everyone—grubbers and junkmen—at the same time. He plans an attack on the city, based heavily on the talkers. By {{stirring}} up an animal attack on the city opposite the spaceport they easily take the spaceship, and therefore the city. Jason is thus able to get the <b>grubbers</b> and junkmen into a room without them killing each other.|$|R
5000|$|After several weeks, Jason {{leaves the}} city {{in search of the}} <b>grubbers,</b> who live in harmony with the harsh environment; they are in fact thriving, with numbers well in excess of the city's, despite lacking its {{advanced}} technology. They practice what many would consider suicidal forms of animal husbandry, with the assistance of their telepathic [...] "talkers". Jason is able to earn their trust by demonstrating his own abilities.|$|R
50|$|The game {{supports}} 3 controller types; The standard Wii remote, the Wii remote {{with the}} Nunchuck and the Game Cube Controller. Wicked Witch {{stated that the}} controls are intuitive but can take time to learn. Wii remote shaking is used to successfully tackle or break a tackle. There are 4 types of kicks including Drop Punts, Torpedoes, Snaps (Check Sides) and <b>Grubbers</b> but only 1 type of handball which increases in elevation depending on power.|$|R
2500|$|Attacking kicks {{are also}} employed, usually if the {{opposition}} is out of position or running at them is proving ineffective. Common attacking kicks include the [...] "up and under", box kick, [...] "grubber", crossfield kick and chip kick. The up and under, {{also known as a}} [...] "bomb" [...] or Garryowen, is a high punt. A well executed up and under will be high enough to give anyone chasing enough time to compete for the ball. Box kicks are similar, but are kicked by the scrum-half over their shoulder when a ruck, maul, scrum or line-out occurs near the touchline. The ball is kicked high and parallel to the touchline with the wingers chasing. If the ball is kicked along the ground it is called a <b>grubber.</b> It can catch the defenders unaware and because the ball is oval shaped it does not bounce consistently, making it hard for them to collect it. A cross field kick occurs when the ball is kicked from one touchline to a player waiting near the other one. Chip kicks are short kicks just behind the defensive line for attacking players to run onto. Like defensive kicks there is still a risk that the opposition will regain possession after an attacking kick.|$|E
2500|$|In {{the fifth}} minute the Tigers were {{mounting}} an attack ten metres from the Cowboys line when {{on the third}} tackle, hooker Robbie Farah put his prop forward Anthony Laffranchi through a gap to crash over the line and score near the uprights. Brett Hodgson kicked the extra two points so the Tigers were leading 18-6 [...] Ten minutes later the Cowboys were attacking the Tigers' try line when Thurston, ten metres out flicked the ball back to Travis Norton who charged over to score. Josh Hannay converted the try so the Cowboys were behind 18-12. In the sixty-third minute the Tigers had the ball down near the Cowboys' try-line and moved it out to Daniel Fitzhenry on the right wing to dive over in the corner. Hodgson kicked the goal from near the sideline to convert the try, taking the Tigers' lead out to 24-12. With {{six and a half}} minutes remaining, Tigers half-back Scott Prince attempted a field goal but missed. Shortly after that Cowboys winger Matt Sing almost scored a try but the video referee found that he'd knocked on. A few minutes later though, the Cowboys were down close to the Tigers' try line where their half-back Johnathan Thurston threw a cut out pass to Matt Sing to score on the right wing. Josh Hannay missed the conversion so the score was 24-16 in favour of the Tigers with under two minutes left to play. Seconds before the final siren the Tigers got one more try when Hodgson, from ten metres out, put a <b>grubber</b> kick into the Cowboys' in-goal area for Todd Payten to dive onto. Hodgson then converted the try so the final score was 30-16, and the Wests Tigers had their first premiership as a merged team.|$|E

50|$|Jason now reveals all. Although {{all life}} on Pyrrus competes for {{survival}} individually, they react collectively to natural disasters. The <b>grubbers,</b> {{with the assistance}} of their talkers, have integrated themselves peacefully into the planet's ecosystem, killing only for food or in self-defense. The junkmen, however, think only of killing, and kill everything they can simply because they can. The ecosystem is simply responding in kind, and in fact cultivates mutations around the city dedicated to the sole purpose of killing humans.|$|R

25|$|By the 1980s, the {{integral}} MCG pitch – grown from Merri Creek black soil – {{was considered the}} worst in Australia, in some matches exhibiting wildly inconsistent bounce which could see balls pass through as <b>grubbers</b> or rear dangerously high – a phenomenon which was put down to damage caused by footballers in winter and increased use for cricket during the summers of the 1970s. The integral pitch has since been removed and drop-in pitches have been used since 1996, generally offering consistent bounce and a fair balance between bat and ball.|$|R

Good fly-halves are calm, clear thinking and have the vision to direct effective attacking plays. Fly-halves need good passing and kicking skills. Often the fly-half is the best kicker in the team and {{needs to be able to}} execute attacking kicks such as up-and-unders, <b>grubbers</b> and chip kicks as well as being able to kick for territory.
