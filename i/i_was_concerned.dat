Ponting's arm was so badly damaged {{that it had to be}} pinned. Told to endure a 14-week lay-off, he never played competitive football again. He later wrote: [...] "At one stage <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> that the arm injury might also stop me from playing cricket but they [...] did a pretty good job on pinning the bones—and it hasn't bothered me since." ...|$|E

[...] Sullivan was enthusiastic, later recalling, [...] " [...] read it through ...in {{the manner of a}} man considerably disappointed with what he had written.

Recalling Unwin's radio and television performances, Anderson thought that the self-made language would suit the character of an eccentric undercover operative, and could produce humour if demonstrated to have a confusing effect on enemies. He elaborated, [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> Stanley came first and then the idea had to accommodate him.

When Woo could not explain what he wanted with a shot to cinematographer Russell Carpenter, he would resort to simple statements such as [...] "this will be the Sam Peckinpah shot" [...] to get his message across to Carpenter. Actor Lance Henriksen recalled that it was a gradual process that led everyone involved to start seeing the film as a John Woo film rather than a Jean-Claude Van Damme film.

500|$|Despite their {{sometimes}} differing viewpoints, {{these experts}} generally agree that Bismarck would have eventually foundered if the Germans had not scuttled her first. Ballard estimated that Bismarck could still have floated {{for at least}} a day when the British vessels ceased fire and could have been captured by the Royal Navy, a position supported by the historian Ludovic Kennedy (who was serving [...] on the destroyer [...] at the time). Kennedy stated, [...] "That she would have foundered eventually there can be little doubt; but the scuttling ensured that it was sooner rather than later." [...] When asked whether Bismarck would have sunk if the Germans had not scuttled the ship, Cameron replied [...] "Sure. But it might have taken half a day." [...] In Mearns' subsequent book Hood and Bismarck, he conceded that scuttling [...] "may have hastened the inevitable, but only by a matter of minutes." [...] Ballard later concluded that [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> the British had sunk the ship regardless of who delivered the final blow." ...|$|E

500|$|The album's {{material}} also {{marked a}} certain honing of Plant's vocal approach, and signalled his {{emergence as a}} serious songwriter. Plant's name had previously been absent from the songwriting credits of the band's first album due to the previous contractual commitments that resulted from his earlier association with CBS Records as a solo artist. His influence on tracks such as [...] "What Is and What Should Never Be" [...] and [...] "Ramble On" [...] were pointers to the band's musical future. Plant has commented {{that it was only}} during the sessions for Led Zeppelin II that he started to feel at home as a vocalist in the studio with Led Zeppelin. In a 2008 interview for Uncut, he stated [...] "uring Led Zep I (1969) as far as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> I thought that I was going to [...] anyway. I didn't feel that comfortable because {{there were a lot of}} demands on me vocally—which there were all the way through the Zeppelin thing.

500|$|World Painted Blood {{marked the}} first time that the band wrote {{material}} in the studio rather than entering the studio fully prepared with lyrics. The fact that they were not prepared made guitarist Kerry King skeptical. King related: [...] "I was kind of thinking, 'Man, this could be the first record in a long time that's got a little bit of filler,'" [...] he acknowledges. [...] "But I think every song came out great. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> some would sound similar, and every one is completely different. It's cool how it worked out." [...] The majority of the lyrics and music were written by guitarist Jeff Hanneman. Kerry King stated: [...] "I like when Jeff writes as much as he did for this record. When you have one guy doing most of the writing you only get one perspective. A lot of Jeff's stuff has a very punky vibe this time; the stuff I write sounds thrashy but with a hint of punk, and when Jeff writes the stuff is more punk with a hint of thrash. It works together well." [...] Unlike 2006's Christ Illusion, the band was [...] "under-ready" [...] with their lyrics and music.|$|E
500|$|The police {{tried to}} {{restrain}} {{some of the}} crowd, and knocked a few people down, which incited bystanders even more. Some of those handcuffed in the wagon escaped when police left them unattended (deliberately, according to some witnesses). As the crowd tried to overturn the police wagon, two police cars and the wagon—with a few slashed tires—left immediately, with Inspector Pine urging them to return as soon as possible. The commotion attracted more people who learned what was happening. Someone in the crowd declared that the bar had been raided because [...] "they didn't pay off the cops", to which someone else yelled [...] "Let's pay them off!" [...] Coins sailed through the air towards the police as the crowd shouted [...] "Pigs!" [...] and [...] "Faggot cops!" [...] Beer cans were thrown and the police lashed out, dispersing some of the crowd who found a construction site nearby with stacks of bricks. The police, outnumbered by between 500 and 600people, grabbed several people, including folk singer Dave Van Ronk—who had been attracted to the revolt from a bar two doors away from the Stonewall. Though Van Ronk was not gay, he had experienced police violence when he participated in antiwar demonstrations: [...] "As far as <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned,</b> anybody who'd stand against the cops was all right with me, and that's why I stayed in... Every time you turned around the cops were pulling some outrage or another." [...] Ten police officers—including two policewomen—barricaded themselves, Van Ronk, Howard Smith (a writer for The Village Voice), and several handcuffed detainees inside the Stonewall Inn for their own safety.|$|E

2500|$|Talbot's mode of chivalry is {{replaced}} by politicians concerned only with themselves and their own advancement: Winchester, Somerset, Suffolk, even Richard. As Jane Howell, director of the BBC Shakespeare adaptation argues, [...] "what <b>I</b> <b>was</b> <b>concerned</b> about in the first play [...] was {{that for a long}} time, the code of the people had been chivalry. But with the death of Talbot, one starts to see a demise of chivalry." [...] Narcissistic political infighting has supplanted self-sacrificing patriotism and chivalry: [...] "the play charts the disastrous breakdown of civility among the English nobility." [...] Nobles concerned with personal power above all else have replaced knights concerned only with the empire. As such, {{by the end of the}} play, both Talbot and his son lay dead, as does the notion of English chivalry. In this sense then, the play [...] "depicts the deaths of the titanic survivors of an ancien régime." ...|$|E
2500|$|A survey {{published}} by Radio Times magazine in March 2004 revealed that Casualty has featured more future stars {{than any other}} UK soap or drama series.
