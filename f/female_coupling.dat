It is constructed of forged aluminum alloy, and is angled to reduce stress of the connection made between the high-pressure <b>female</b> <b>coupling</b> of the high pressure hose.

5000|$|Generally {{it takes}} several {{individuals}} {{to build a}} hose load, at least one on each end. A third person handing the hose to the two individuals on the ends facilitates the process. After the desired length of hose is connected, and sometimes the air removed from the interior with a fire hose vacuum, it is laid in a compartment or hose bed in a predetermined manner {{depending on the type}} of lay being built. Almost always the nozzle or female end or both are made easily accessible from the exterior. In the case of a [...] "pre-connect", the <b>female</b> <b>coupling</b> is attached to a discharge on the engine, making deployment even faster.|$|E
5000|$|The patent {{examiner}} {{was starting to}} wonder if Judson wasn't on a fishing expedition to ascertain if his idea was actually novel. However, eventually, after the last amendment was filed, the patent was approved in May 1893, along with an improved version. When the two patents were finally issued on August 29 (along with 378 others that day), they received the numbers U.S.P. 504,038 (first) and U.S.P. 504,037 (second). These patents describe several designs of the [...] "clasp-locker". Later design patents of the fastener describe opposite elements on each side that are identical {{to each other and}} fit together by the engaging of [...] "pintles" [...] and [...] "sockets." [...] In his patent U.S.P. 557,207 of 1896 is a description mostly like the zipper of today. ... each link of each chain is provided both with a male and <b>female</b> <b>coupling</b> part, and when the chains are coupled together the female part of each link on one chain is engaged by the male part of a link on the other chain.|$|E

40|$|Art, should comfort the {{disturbed}} and {{disturb the}} comfortable” (Banksy.) I feel {{the power of}} art is derived from its ability to allow otherness to be addressed, encouraging the viewer to engage with topics that are ignored or difficult for them. Art is the platform for my critique of society. My work focuses specifically on my personal experiences relating to the “F” word. Female. “ 1 a (1) : of, relating to, or being the sex that typically {{has the capacity to}} bear young or produce eggs In a field of milkweed, I watched a female monarch butterfly deposit a single egg on the underside of a leaf. —Tom Tyning A few months later, she became the highest paid female performer on the Great White Way. —Susannah McCorkle (2) : having or producing only pistils or pistillate flowers a female holly female inflorescences b : made up of usually adult members of the female sex : consisting of females the female workforce c : characteristic of girls, women, or the female sex : exhibiting femaleness composed for female voices a female name d : designed for or typically used by girls or women a female glove e : engaged in or exercised by girls or women female suffrage 2 : having some quality (such as small size or delicacy of sound) associated with the female sex female castanets 3 : designed with a hollow or groove into which a corresponding male part fits the <b>female</b> <b>coupling</b> of a hose — femaleness noun`` (Webster.) Feeling bound to use the “F” word as my label, {{is a perfect example of}} the otherness that drives my work. I create wearable props that exaggerate and imprison my figure, drawing attention to the restrictions I feel placed on me for just being female. External stimuli like advertising images and day-to-day life interactions provide the inspiration for these objects. I look at artists like Nick Cave and how his soundsuits fuel the viewers senses without preconceived judgment, by eliminating identity. During this journey as a woodworker, I have been trying to push the preconceived notions that I have created about the material. It is my goal to attack the boundaries of wood through the incorporation of varying, unconventional materials, as well as the concept of what wood can be used for. There are endless possibilities to all things and what an artist may do. It is only now that I have begun to find what I’m passionate about, my mind has been opened to the possibilities of creating work that challenges me...|$|E
