5|$|Between 1994 and 2009, {{the city}} had a declining and aging {{population}} compared to Tel Aviv and <b>Jerusalem,</b> <b>as</b> young people moved {{to the center of}} the country for education and jobs, while young families migrated to bedroom communities in the suburbs. However, as a result of new projects and improving infrastructure, the city managed to reverse its population decline, reducing emigration while attracting more internal migration into the city. In 2009, positive net immigration into the city was shown for the first time in 15 years.|$|E
5|$|Darwaza {{became a}} member of the Arab Executive Committee and in 1930 was {{appointed}} by rival nationalist Haj Amin al-Husseini (now the Grand Mufti of <b>Jerusalem)</b> <b>as</b> the General Administrator of the Waqf (Islamic religious trust) under the Supreme Muslim Council. In 1931, he convinced his city's MCA to change its name to the Patriotic Arab Association. Unlike other Arab politicians at the time, Darwaza supported a combination of pan-Arabism, Islamism, and dedication to the Palestinian nationalist ideal.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} fourth century Armenia, under king Tiridates III, {{became the first}} country to adopt Christianity as a state religion. A large number of Armenian monks are {{recorded}} to have settled in <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>as</b> early as the fourth century, after the uncovering of Christian holy places in the city. However, the first written records are from the fifth century. Jerusalem is thus considered the oldest living diaspora community outside the Armenian homeland. Philip Marsden wrote that the survival of Armenians in Jerusalem–"most intense of all cities"—proves their extraordinary resilience.|$|E

The United Nations Security Council, the United Nations General Assembly, the International Court of Justice, and the International Committee of the Red Cross {{refer to it as}} Occupied Palestinian Territory. The area and population of Jerusalem includes that of East Jerusalem which has been de facto annexed by Israel and incorporated within Jerusalem's municipal borders under the Jerusalem Law. This, however, is not recognized by the international community who regard East <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>as</b> part of the Occupied Palestinian Territory.|$|E
5|$|Tiberius Julius Alexander (fl. 1st century) was an equestrian {{governor}} and {{general in the}} Roman Empire. Born into a wealthy Jewish family of Alexandria but abandoning or neglecting the Jewish religion, he rose to become procurator of Judea (c. 4648) under Claudius. While Prefect of Egypt (6669), he employed his legions against the Alexandrian Jews in a brutal response to ethnic violence, and {{was instrumental in the}} Emperor Vespasian's rise to power. In 70, he participated in the Siege of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>as</b> Titus' second-in-command.|$|E

5|$|Baldwin and {{his group}} arrived at Tyre on 16 September 1190. Richard did not arrive in Syria until 1191. It is unclear exactly why they were sent ahead of the king; perhaps it was {{to look out for}} the king's {{interests}} while Richard took a more leisurely route, or perhaps to rid the king's entourage of a family grouping around Glanvill that the king did not trust. Baldwin was not a member or close associate of the Glanvill faction, so most likely he was sent ahead to look after the king's interests, whatever the reasons for the inclusion of his companions. Another concern may have been to get help to the Kingdom of <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>as</b> quickly as possible after the king learned of Frederick Barbarossa's death {{on the way to the}} Holy Land.|$|E
5|$|From a {{military}} point of view, the 10th Harel Brigade required reinforcements and Ben-Gurion dispatched {{a battalion of}} the 6th Etzioni Brigade. He considered it imperative that the 7th Brigade join the forces in <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>as</b> well as a contingent of 400 new recruits to reinforce the Harel Brigade. Weapons and spare parts that had arrived in Israel by air were also now ready for combat on the Jerusalem front. The commander of the 7th Brigade wished to neutralize {{the negative effects of}} the debacle on the morale of the troops and on his prestige. The central front was reorganized and its command given to an American volunteer fighting on the Israeli side, Colonel David Marcus, who was subsequently appointed Aluf (Major General). He took command of the Etzioni and 7th Brigades, and the 10th Palmach Harel Brigade.|$|E
5|$|Hasan Pasha's {{nickname}} Arap ("Bedouin") {{derived from}} the Ridwan family's good relations with and reputation for keeping the Bedouin tribes in check. When Hasan was commissioned by Sultan Murad IV to help suppress the long-running rebellion of Fakhr ad-Din II (1623-1635), Hasan's Bedouin units often proved effective in battle. During this period, Hasan Pasha gained the additional governorship of Tripoli, although he was deposed in 1644. His rule impoverished Gaza Sanjak and burdened the Ridwan family with heavy debts. According to the Damascene historian and Hasan's contemporary, Muhammad Amin al-Muhibbi, Hasan Pasha had numerous wives and concubines and fathered 85 children. During Hasan Pasha's lifetime, one of his sons, Husayn Pasha, served as governor of Nablus and <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>as</b> well as amir al-hajj.|$|E

5|$|Meanwhile, Otto of Freising and {{the remnant}} of his troops arrived in Jerusalem early in April, and Conrad soon after. Fulk, Latin Patriarch of Jerusalem, {{was sent to}} invite Louis to join them. The fleet that had stopped at Lisbon arrived around this time, {{as well as the}} Provençals who had left Europe under the command of Alfonso Jordan, Count of Toulouse. Alfonso himself did not make it to <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>as</b> he died at Caesarea. He was {{supposedly}} poisoned by Raymond II of Tripoli, the nephew who feared his political aspirations in the county. The claim that Raymond had poisoned Alfonso caused much of the Provençal force to turn back and go home. The original focus of the crusade was Edessa, but the preferred target of King Baldwin III and the Knights Templar was Damascus.|$|E
5|$|Miles of Plancy briefly {{held the}} regency for the underaged Baldwin IV. Miles {{was assassinated in}} October 1174, and Raymond III was soon {{appointed}} to replace him. Raymond named William chancellor of <b>Jerusalem,</b> <b>as</b> well as archdeacon of Nazareth, and on 6 June 1175, William was elected archbishop of Tyre to replace Frederick de la Roche, {{who had died in}} October 1174. William's duties as chancellor probably did not take up too much of his time; the scribes and officials in the chancery drafted documents and it may not have even been necessary for him to be present to sign them. Instead he focused on his duties as archbishop. In 1177 he performed the funeral services for William of Montferrat, husband of Baldwin IV's sister Sibylla, when the patriarch of Jerusalem, Amalric of Nesle, was too sick to attend.|$|E
5|$|The {{morphology}} of Proto-Central-Semitic shows {{significant changes}} compared with Proto-Semitic, especially in its verbs, and {{is much like}} in Classical Arabic. Nouns in the singular were usually declined in three cases: /-u/ (nominative), /-a/ (accusative) or /-i/ (genitive). In some circumstances (but never in the construct state), nouns also took a final nasal after the case ending: nunation (final /-n/) occurred in some languages, mimation (final /-m/) in others. The original meaning of this marker is uncertain. In Classical Arabic, final /-n/ on nouns indicates indefiniteness and disappears when the noun is preceded by a definite article or otherwise becomes definite in meaning. In other languages, final /-n/ may be present whenever a noun {{is not in the}} construct state. Old Canaanite had mimation, of uncertain meaning, in an occurrence of the word urušalemim (<b>Jerusalem)</b> <b>as</b> given in an Egyptian transcription.|$|E

5|$|Van Eyck's {{earlier work}} often shows churches and cathedrals in older Romanesque style, {{sometimes}} {{to represent the}} Temple in <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>as</b> an appropriate historical setting, with decoration drawn exclusively from the Old Testament. That is clearly not the case here – the Christ Child occupies the same space as a large rood cross depicting him being crucified. The church in this panel is contemporary Gothic – a choice perhaps intended to associate Mary with the Ecclesia Triumphans – while her pose and oversized scale are indebted to the forms and conventions of Byzantine art and the International Gothic. Van Eyck details the architecture with a precision not seen before in northern European painting.|$|E
5|$|All five {{versions}} of the speech differ widely from one another in regard to particulars. All versions, except that in the Gesta Francorum, generally agree that Urban talked about the violence of European society {{and the necessity of}} maintaining the Peace of God; about helping the Greeks, who had asked for assistance; about the crimes being committed against Christians in the east; and about a new kind of war, an armed pilgrimage, and of rewards in heaven, where remission of sins was offered to any who might die in the undertaking. They do not all specifically mention <b>Jerusalem</b> <b>as</b> the ultimate goal. However, {{it has been argued that}} Urban's subsequent preaching reveals that he expected the expedition to reach Jerusalem all along. According to one version of the speech, the enthusiastic crowd responded with cries of Deus vult! ("God wills it!"). However, other {{versions of}} the speech do not include this detail.|$|E
5|$|British General Edmund Allenby, Commander-in-Chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force (EEF), had won {{a decisive}} victory against the German General Erich von Falkenhayn, {{commander}} of Ottoman forces in Palestine, at the Battle of Mughar Ridge on 13 November. The British Empire victory forced von Falkenhayn to withdraw his Seventh and Eighth Armies (commanded by Fevzi Pasha and Kress von Kressenstein respectively) and move his headquarters from Jerusalem to Nablus on 14 November. As the Ottoman III Corps (Seventh Army) reached Jerusalem via the Hebron road after its defeat at Beersheba, it was ordered to develop defences around Jerusalem. This corps held the city while the XX Corps retreated from Junction Station into the Judean Hills towards <b>Jerusalem.</b> <b>As</b> they retired the XX Corps left strong rearguards to stop or slow the British advance. Time was needed to construct defences and for reorganisation of the depleted and disorganised Seventh Army. When they arrived in the city XX Corps took over responsibility for Jerusalem's defences, while III Corps continued to move northwards from Jerusalem along the Nablus road.|$|E
