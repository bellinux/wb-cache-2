2500|$|On {{the ship}} the second officer is the officer that works under the Master, i.e. the Captain {{of the ship}} and {{shoulders}} the responsibility of checking the functionality of all the navigational equipment, such as the Echo-sounder, Radar, ECDIS, AIS, and on some vessels even the <b>GMDSS</b> radio equipment, however recently it has been observed that Companies tend to designate the responsibility of maintaining the <b>GMDSS</b> equipment to the third officer. These checks are made in according to the companies planned maintenance system. In addition these checks are usually made prior to arrival and departure ports. Often if any navigational equipment is suspected of being faulty then it should be checked that the equipment is in working order as per the given performance standards.|$|E

2500|$|Through May 2013, the First, Second, and Third Class (commercial) Radiotelegraph Licenses using code tests {{based upon}} the CODEX {{standard}} word were still being issued in the United States by the Federal Communications Commission. [...] The First Class license required 20 WPM code group and 25 WPM text code proficiency, the others 16 WPM code group test (five letter blocks sent as simulation of receiving encrypted text) and 20 WPM code text (plain language) test. [...] It was also necessary to pass written tests on operating practice and electronics theory. [...] A unique additional demand for the First Class was a requirement of a year of experience for operators of shipboard and coast stations using Morse. [...] This allowed the holder to be chief operator on board a passenger ship. [...] However, since 1999 the use of satellite and very high-frequency maritime communications systems (<b>GMDSS)</b> has made them obsolete. [...] (By that point meeting experience requirement for the First was very difficult.) [...] Currently, only one class of license, the Radiotelegraph Operator License, is issued. [...] This is granted either when the tests are passed or as the Second and First are renewed and become this lifetime license. [...] For new applicants, it requires passing a written examination on electronic theory and radiotelegraphy practices, as well as 16 WPM codegroup and 20 WPM text tests. [...] However, the code exams are currently waived for holders of Amateur Extra Class licenses who obtained their operating privileges under the old 20 WPM test requirement.|$|E

50|$|For these reasons, the International Maritime Organization (IMO), a United Nations agency {{specializing in}} safety of {{shipping}} and preventing ships from polluting the seas, began looking at ways of improving maritime distress and safety communications. In 1979, {{a group of}} experts drafted the International Convention on Maritime Search and Rescue, which called for development of a global search and rescue plan. This group also passed a resolution calling for development by IMO of a Global Maritime Distress and Safety System (<b>GMDSS)</b> to provide the communication support needed to implement the search and rescue plan. This new system, which the world's maritime nations are implementing, is based upon a combination of satellite and terrestrial radio services, and has changed international distress communications from being primarily ship-to-ship based to ship-to-shore (Rescue Coordination Center) based. It spelled the end of Morse code communications for {{all but a few}} users, such as amateur radio operators. The <b>GMDSS</b> provides for automatic distress alerting and locating in cases where a radio operator doesn't have time to send an SOS or MAYDAY call, and, for the first time, requires ships to receive broadcasts of maritime safety information which could prevent a distress from happening in the first place. In 1988, IMO amended the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) Convention, requiring ships subject to it fit <b>GMDSS</b> equipment. Such ships were required to carry NAVTEX and satellite EPIRBs by August 1, 1993, and had to fit all other <b>GMDSS</b> equipment by February 1, 1999. US ships were allowed to fit <b>GMDSS</b> in lieu of Morse telegraphy equipment by the Telecommunications Act of 1996.|$|E
50|$|The {{specification}} (IEC 61097-14 Ed 1.0) for AIS-SART {{was developed}} by the IEC's TC80 AIS work group. AIS-SART was added to the <b>GMDSS</b> regulations effective January 1, 2010.|$|E

50|$|In {{order to}} operate a marine radio {{transmitter}} on 2182 kHz, the operator must hold a <b>GMDSS</b> General Operating Certificate for mandatory installations, a Long Range Certificate for voluntary ones, or other equivalent and recognised radio operator's qualifications. Both these certificates have a wider syllabus {{than those of the}} <b>GMDSS</b> Restricted Operators Course or the RYA Short Range Certificate that is necessary for marine VHF use. In practice, an unqualified operator would not be prosecuted for the use of either transmitter in what {{turns out to be a}} genuine distress situation.|$|E
50|$|Finally, to {{actually}} {{serve as a}} <b>GMDSS</b> operator on most commercial vessels the United States Coast Guard requires additional classroom training and practical experience beyond just holding a license.|$|E
