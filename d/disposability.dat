Not taking himself at all seriously, Bolan is free to pursue whatever silly wordplay, cosmic fantasies or non sequitur imagery he feels like; his abandonment of any pretense to art becomes, ironically, a statement in itself. Bolan's lack of pomposity, back-to-basics songwriting, and elaborate theatrics went on to influence everything from hard rock to punk to new wave. But in the end, it's that sense of playfulness, combined with a raft of irresistible hooks, that keeps Electric Warrior such an infectious, invigorating listen today." ...|$|E

Ware experiments with the book as printed object in a way similar to the experimental French comics collective Oubapo, paying particular attention to the physical aspects of the individual books—the quality of the paper, binding and page dimensions. In a world of <b>disposability</b> and instant communication, Ware states on the reverse of the book that [...] "it's sometimes reassuring—perhaps even necessary—to have something to hold on to". In all, the box contained four broadsheets, three magazines, two strips, two pamphlets, a four-panel storyboard, a hardcover book, and a book designed to mimic the Little Golden Books style.|$|E

It was saying: 'Bondage—forget it! I'm not going to be bound by the laws of consumerism or bound by my own senses.'

5000|$|At first Knipfel {{was dead}} set against writing a memoir, and was [...] "content to publish in small publications" [...] and was quite [...] "happy with the sheer <b>disposability</b> of {{newspaper}} writing", however, when Penguin Putnam editor David Groff {{offered him a}} book deal in 1997, {{after a decade of}} writing his column for New York Press, he accepted, rationalizing [...] "that maybe there wasn't anything all that wrong with leaving something a little more solid behind". The first draft of Slackjaw was completed in two weeks and at 500 pages long it was largely a collection of several dozen independent stories drawn from his columns. Although Knipfel could not discern a greater theme in the first draft, his editor pointed out that the memoir generally chronicled his journey towards blindness. With this theme in mind, Knipfel rewrote several drafts of Slackjaw, [...] "looking at the stories in a different way and trying to find something that flows and has a rhythm", which finally produced a leaner memoir of which 60% of the content was fresh.|$|E

Another episode illustrating this aspect of Martinelli's personality is recalled by Gaetano Fichera. When he was back in Rome in 1945, at the end of the Second World War, he exposed to Martinelli a theory identical to the theory of differential form: he developed it while being prisoner of the nazists in Teramo during wartime. Martinelli, very tactfully, told him that the idea was already being developed by Élie Cartan and Georges de Rham.|$|E

We can't have it both ways, and anyway, why would we want to? As the oldest surviving tradition connecting Hollywood to its audience, Oscar bait is all the movies have left to insulate them from the dull, encroaching <b>disposability</b> of the culture around us.

5000|$|While Andrews’ output {{prior to}} 1996 {{tends to be}} {{in black and white}} or monochrome, around this time he {{introduces}} colour into his work. The Weather Series (1996) begins the artists’ extended investigation into the processes of colour generation and the four-colour separation printing processes. [...] For Andrews, weather provides an analogy for the quickly changing circumstances of life, likening it to his own experience of living with HIV. [...] Andrews’ method of homemade colour separation evokes both the 19th-century painting technique of Pointillism: “in which small, distinct dots of pure color are applied in patterns to form an image”, and the Ben-Day dots of mechanical printing. Beyond these references, Andrews’ uses the technique to, at the same time, evoke the alchemy of vision and break its mechanics down. As a result, Andrews creates works that “hover at legibility.” [...] “The pixilation or dot matrix completely obscures details, making specifics impossible to see. We can't grasp the full picture.“ [...] The series of rubbed-crayon drawings, The Quick and the Dead (2004), feature stills derived from video footage of the Iraq war. By drawing the viewer’s eye back {{to the surface of the}} work, he creates ambiguities of meaning. Considered in relation to the source material Andrews uses, the work has political implications, “suggesting the impossibility of knowing the circumstances and contexts of what they depict.” [...] The artist has stated the series is “my response to the lack of photographic evidence of the war...information was really only available on websites at that time. The <b>disposability</b> of these media images is in stark contrast to the effects on the lives of those involved.“ [...] Andrews also used 600 drawings from the series to create one minute animation, The Quick and the Dead (2004).|$|E

30|$|Although {{numerous}} DEA analyses {{have used}} the directional distance function, some of these studies, such as Chung et al. (1997) and Färe et al. (2001), imposed a weak <b>disposability</b> assumption on undesirable outputs through equality constraint. Weak <b>disposability</b> means that undesirable outputs cannot be reduced without lowering the production level of desirable outputs (see Kuosmanen 2005). This study, however, assumes that undesirable output (CO 2 emissions) can be reduced with no limit, and thus imposes a free (strong) <b>disposability</b> assumption on undesirable output using the inequality constraint in Eq. (4). In other words, under a strong <b>disposability</b> condition, the reduction of CO 2 emissions in each prefecture could be achieved without assuming certain costs (see Mandal and Madheswaran 2010; Oggioni et al. 2011). Given that this study targets reduction of CO 2 emissions while increasing production levels, it assumes strong <b>disposability.</b>|$|E

30|$|The {{difference}} between the two <b>disposability</b> concepts is that the production technology under natural <b>disposability,</b> or P_v^N (X), has X>∑_j = 1 ^nX_jλ_j, implying that a DMU can attain an efficiency frontier by reducing a directional vector of inputs. Meanwhile, that of the managerial <b>disposability,</b> or P_v^M (X), has X<∑_j = 1 ^nX_jλ_j, implying that a DMU can attain a status of an efficiency frontier by increasing a directional vector of inputs. Meanwhile, a common feature of the two <b>disposability</b> concepts is that both have G <∑_j = 1 ^nG_jλ_j and B>∑_j = 1 ^nB_jλ_j in their axiomatic expressions. These conditions intuitively appeal to us because an efficiency frontier for desirable outputs should locate above or on all observations, while that of undesirable outputs should locate below or on these observations.
