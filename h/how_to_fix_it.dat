2500|$|Car Talk was {{presented}} {{in the form of}} a call-in radio show: listeners called in with questions related to motor vehicle maintenance and repair. Most of the advice sought was diagnostic, with callers describing symptoms and demonstrating sounds of an ailing vehicle while the Magliozzis made an attempt to identify the malfunction over the telephone and give advice on <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> <b>it.</b> While the hosts peppered their call-in sessions with jokes directed at both the caller and at themselves, the Magliozzis were usually able to arrive at a diagnosis. However, when they were stumped, they attempted anyway with an answer they claimed was [...] "unencumbered by the thought process", the official motto of the show.|$|E

50|$|Bugtraq is an {{electronic}} mailing list dedicated to issues about computer security. On-topic issues are new discussions about vulnerabilities, vendor security-related announcements, methods of exploitation, and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> them. <b>It</b> is a high-volume mailing list, {{and almost all}} new vulnerabilities are discussed there. This forum provides a vehicle for software and system manufacturers to communicate in a targeted fashion with their installed base to inform them of new vulnerabilities, {{so they can be}} rapidly addressed. From the perspective of the enterprise, it also provides a consolidated view of vulnerabilities, eliminating the need to try to track down announcements from individual vendors; as well as providing a forum to seek information from peers.|$|R

2500|$|Once they arrive, the two cosmonauts sent to Parity {{discover}} that their predecessors have disappeared completely. Before leaving, they {{left a note}} stating that they had made contact with intelligent life from the planet Lesnaya Grud'. Together, they decided to keep their findings private out of fear for the political turmoil that might occur. The inhabitants of Lesnaya Grud' had traveled to Parity and transported the two cosmonauts to their home planet. From there, the cosmonauts send a transmission back to Parity describing the planet. It has a much larger population than Earth, nobody has any concept of war, {{and there is an}} established and functional world government. Furthermore, Lesnaya Grud' suffers from the problem of [...] "internal withering," [...] where portions of the planet turn to uninhabitable desert. Although this problem will not be critical for many millions of years, the inhabitants of Lesnaya Grud' are already trying {{to decide what to do}} about <b>it</b> and <b>how</b> <b>to</b> possibly <b>fix</b> <b>it.</b>|$|R

If {{you want one}} hundred years of prosperity, educate people. ” (Chinese Proverb) Throughout the past decade, the act of {{practicing}} sustainability, slow food, and local food has only gained recognition and acceptance. However, with our population growing significantly, simply talking about {{it is no longer}} enough. Industries, foodservice in particular, is past due merely talking about <b>how</b> <b>to</b> <b>fix</b> the problem; <b>it</b> is time to make a change. There are so many done in the restaurant industry that contributes to the fall of our ecosystem. Considering Americans spend 48 percent of their food budget on food consumed outside the home, restaurants and those who work in them {{have a great deal of}} responsibility in rescuing the health of our planet. Fortunately, there are many ways we as companies and as individuals can make a difference everyday with minor changes in our daily routines, from water conservation, to compost and recycling, and so much more. Organizations such as the Green Restaurant Association are also making considerable strides in mending what has been nearly destroyed. Recognizing the amount of time and money not only Americans, but others throughout the world, put into dining out on a regular basis can help drastically change the “ecological footprint” the foodservice industry made...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this note is to record a proof that the space of finite-to-finite correspondences on an OT-manifold (these are the compact complex {{manifolds}} introduced by Oeljeklaus and the second author in [6]) is discrete. As a consequnce we obtain that OT-manifolds with t = 1 (see the description below) are essentially saturated. By a finite-to-finite corrrespondence on a compact complex manifold X we mean an irreducible complex-anlaytic subset of X × X that projects finite-to-one and onto each co-ordinate. We denote by Corr(X) the set of all finite-to-finite correspondences. Theorem 1. If X is an OT-manifold then Corr(X) is discrete. The proof, which we will sketch below, follows to some extent what was done for Inoue surfaces of type SM in [3]. But this approach leads naturally to the consideration of finite unramified coverings of OT-manifolds, and the latter need no longer be OT; at least they are not formally instances of the original construction in [6]. However, the second author has worked out a mild generalisation that is preserved under finite unramified coverings. We will quickly review the original construction of OT-manifolds from [6] and then describe <b>how</b> <b>to</b> generalise <b>it.</b> <b>Fix</b> a number field K admitting n = s + 2 t distinct embeddings into C, which we will denote by σ 1, [...] ., σn where σ 1, [...] ., σs are real and each σs+i is complex conjugate to σs+i+t. Let U be a rank s subgroup of the multpilicative group O ∗,+ K: = {a ∈ O ∗ K: σi(a) > 0 for all 1 ≤ i ≤ s} that is admissible for K {{in the sense of}} [6]. With respect to the natural action of U on the additive group OK, consider the semidirect product Γ = U ⋉ OK. Let m = s + t and consider the action of Γ on Cm given by, (a, x) (z 1, [...] ., zm) : = () σ 1 (ax) + σ 1 (a) z 1, [...] ., σm(ax) + σm(a) zm...|$|R
