It first considers the status of existing bilateral investment treaties between Member States and third States and the transitional regime established by Regulation (EU) No 1219 / 2012. It then goes on to examine the developing EU policy in respect of investment protection agreements, including the relations between the competence of the EU and that of Member States and Regulation No. 912 / 2014 on Financial Responsibility linked to Investor-State Dispute Settlement, which implies that the EU accepts the principle that future investor protection agreements concluded by the EU will provide for investor-state arbitration. It then goes on the examine the substantive and procedural rules in the investment chapters of the agreements that the EU is negotiating with Canada, Singapore and the United States and the results of the European Commission’s public consultation on such provisions. In light of the current criticism against investor state investment protection and Investor State Dispute Settlement, the article considers the possible future evolution of investor state protection and arbitration, and foresees that the current regime might face considerable changes...|$|E

This book covers the institutional and legal framework of the external dimension of EU justice and home affairs; issues of policy interaction as well as specific challenges; policy responses and results in the fields of migration policy; judicial cooperation; counter-terrorism; and cooperation with major international partners. Taking into account the changes introduced by the Treaty of Lisbon as well as the priorities set by the 2010 - 2014 Stockholm Programme the book provides an in-depth exploration of the political and legal dynamics of a major new dimension of the EU.

Na taj način ustrojena hijerarhijska ljestvica pravnih izvora pokazuje slojevitost izvora važećeg međunarodnog građanskog procesnog prava na području država članica EU-a. Također, ovaj rad može poslužiti nadležnom hrvatskom sucu u primjeni izvora međunarodnog građanskog procesnog prava u rješavanju privatnopravnih situacija s prekograničnim (EU) i međunarodnim obilježjem. This {{paper is}} {{dedicated}} to the distinguished Professor Dr. Mihajlo Dika, one of the greatest scholars in the field of Civil Procedure Law and a renowned intellectual and humanist. And perhaps more importantly, Professor Dika is an unforgettable teacher and mentor and one of my dearest colleagues. The development of the European Private International Law (PIL) system in the post-Amsterdam (1999) stage of European law shows that its provisions have gradually come under the competence of the EU and have deeply influenced autonomous national law. Croatia entered the EU on 1 July 2013, at which moment the process of communitarization of PIL in the member states (MS) was nearly completed. The process of Croatia 2 ̆ 7 s accession to the EU, which started in 2001, practically coincided with the communitarization of PIL rules in the EU. In civil matters with cross-border implications, faced with a jungle of national and EU PIL rules and competences, every judge and arbitrator in Croatia should apply provisions of PIL, including international civil procedure rules. In order to fulfil his duty he must obey the following hierarchy of norms. According to the general clause in Article 216 TFEU, the EU is empowered to conclude international agreements with one or more third countries. Therefore, in principle, the EU member states lose the authority to enter into international agreements. In these cases, the <b>exclusive</b> <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> of the EU applies (Article 3 (2) TFEU), which only confirms the earlier ECJ Opinion 1 / 03 of 7 February 2006 concerning the conclusion by the EC of the 2007 Lugano Convention to be applied in the European Economic Area. For the purposes of internal market and the constitution of the European judicial area (Article 67 (1) TFEU), which requires common rules of judicial cooperation in civil matters (Article 81 TFEU), the EU has adopted a number of key EU regulations on international jurisdiction, the choice of law (Article 81 (2) (c) TFEU), and mutual recognition and enforcement of judgments (Article 81 (2) (a) TFEU). These regulations are binding in their entirety and directly applicable in Croatia. They prevail over national sources and, as a rule, supersede conventions concluded between member states. That makes national PIL rules, special statutes and PIL Acts or customary law applicable only to legal issues not falling within the (material) scope of EU regulations. Since 1988 a considerable number of directives have been adopted, containing conflict rules with EU-related application. They are binding as well, but they become applicable only by enactment through national legislation, thus producing a direct effect on parties involved in PIL matters. Finally, the national and EU PIL provisions must comply with the general principles of EU law (Articles 18, 20 to 21 TFEU), with free movement (Articles 34 to 36, Article 36, Article 45, Article 49, Article 54, Articles 56 and 63 TFEU); and respect for basic human rights (Article 6, Articles 8 and 13) of the 1950 European Convention on Human Rights) and (Articles 24 and 47) the 2000 EU Charter of Fundamental Rights...|$|E

40|$|The {{present study}} {{addresses}} the question how foreign policy fits within the constitutional {{structure of the}} European Union. It does so by analysing, in the particular field of foreign policy, certain key constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques that are fundamental to the legal organisation of the Union. The study {{is divided into three}} parts. The first part examines {{the way in which the}} principles of conferral and primacy, as well as the Community method operate within Community external relations, as compared to their operation with respect to internal Community policies (for instance, exclusivity as the typical expression of the primacy principle in the field of external relations). The second part draws a further contrast between these concepts, principles, and legal techniques as they apply in relation to the common foreign and security policy and their operation under Community external relations. The subject of the third part are constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques, which, in practice, have been found to have a more significant part to play in Union foreign policy than in its internal policies, in particular the principle of consistency, or which have developed specifically in the field of external relations, in particular the technique of mixity. Essentially, therefore, this is a study of the extent to which foreign policy is legally sui generis within the sui generis constitutional order of the European Union, and of how the common foreign and security policy is in turn sui generis within the foreign policy structure of the Union. It is not of course suggested that the constitutional concepts, principles, and legal techniques that are here analysed are the only significant ones in the constitutional organisation of the Union, just that they are particularly suited to illustrate the sui generis character of the legal arrangements that govern the conduct of EU foreign policy. The present study provides both an analysis of the constitutional reality of EU foreign policy and theoretical reflections at a critical distance, which suggest possibilities for reform.

40|$|In {{this article}} we will present results from our ongoing {{evaluation}} {{of the central government}} program “The Knowledge Promotion Reform – from word to deed”. The aim of the program is to develop schools as organisations with the purpose of improving the learning environment in order to increase students’ social and intellectual development.   Schools apply to the program on their own initiative (open application) or after encouragement and guidance according to needs (guided application).      An important feature of the programme is the reliance of a cooperation model that involves three parties: one or more schools, school owners and <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> partners. On the basis of qualitative interviews with teachers, headmasters, school owners and <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> partners in two case projects involving several schools, we present findings of the effect of the program on schools improvement capacity and project targets. The schools’ initial improvement capacity and the kind of development support they receive are central groups of factors that influence the outcomes. For concepts and identification of relevant factors, we rely on the school development literature (for e. g. Ekholm, 1989; Hopkins, 2009; Miles, 1965 a). Furthermore we use our qualitative interviews to distinguish between various forms/roles of external support and develop concepts that may increase our understanding of how external support affect the school, particularly the role of the <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> partners. Tentatively we argue that goal-directed strategies intended to change activities directly related to pupils’ learning may lead to better results than means-directed strategies where the link to pupil-related activities is less clear...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: This {{paper is}} devoted to the {{comparative}} study of political culture in the two post-communist countries Poland and Ukraine, which are in different stages in the transformation from communist to democratic society. Our analysis is based on data sets provided by the New Democracies Barometer III (1993) and IV (1995). Political culture is defined as a system of orientations toward politics. The evaluative component of such aspects of political culture as regime orientation, <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> and political trust is taken into consideration. Our comparison shows that in Poland the evaluation of <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> is more positive than in Ukraine. The population of Ukraine distrusts the political institutions more than the population of Poland. In Ukraine a substantial part of the population feels nostalgia for communist times, and this nostalgia has a tendency to increase. In Poland on the other hand the majority of population evaluates the communist regime negatively. The structure of the relations between the economic and political orientations is mainly the same in both countries under study. Differences in relations presented in the model have a tendency to decrease. The direction in which Ukraine is heading {{is similar to that of}} Poland. ...|$|R

40|$|On {{the basis}} of the Research Project funded by the Spanish Ministry of Education under the title “Design, {{production}} and evaluation of a 2. 0 learning environment for faculty training in the use of Information and Communication Technologies (ICTs) ” (EDU 2009 - 08 893), experts have used the <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> coefficient to evaluate the different dimensions of Personal Learning Environments (PLE), namely: technical and aesthetic aspects, ease of navigation, or quality of the didactic elements that make up the environment. A quantitative methodology along with a questionnaire prepared by the author served this purpose. The results obtained highlight technical environment operation, the tools forming the PLE, or the learning object repository as being “very positive. ” In conclusion, experts emphasise the user-friendliness of environment and tools alike, as well as the educational aspects of the contents available in materials guide...|$|R
40|$|Although some {{children}} develop Posttraumatic Stress Disorder (PTSD) following a traumatic event, {{such as a}} residential fire, many children continue to function normally. The link between trauma and posttraumatic stress has been well-established; however, less {{is known about the}} relationship between trauma and resiliency. Traditionally, resilience has been defined as behavioral <b>competence</b> and <b>external</b> adaptation, although the role of internalizing disorders in resilience is now being recognized. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine resiliency, as conceptualized by both internal and <b>external</b> <b>competence,</b> following a residential fire. This study also sought to examine the roles of social support, coping and ethnicity in moderating the relationship between resource loss and resiliency. Results indicated there was a significant relationship between loss and resiliency. Specifically, resource loss was found to negatively predict resiliency. None of the proposed moderators were found to be significant. Implications for these findings will then be discussed...|$|R
40|$|Ever {{since its}} {{creation}} the CFSP constituted a deliberately separate category of EU cooperation. The Lisbon Treaty largely undoes this {{and takes a}} significant leap towards integrating the CFSP and former Community elements in a streamlined external action system. It abolishes the pillar structure, accords a single legal personality to the Union and puts in place a common external action framework governed by a single set of principles and objectives. Yet, {{at the same time}} the CFSP remains overtly separate from the other <b>external</b> <b>competences</b> and is still governed by specific rules and procedures. This concurrent emphasis on integration and delimitation places the Union for a genuine paradox that may put the accountability of the Lisbon Treaty’s institutional novelties significantly to the test and force the EU judiciary as well as policy-makers to look for creative ways of adjudicating on and conducting external policy...|$|R
40|$|The {{following}} Report will {{be presented}} to the 22 nd FIDE Congress to be held in Limassol, Cyprus, 1 - 4 November 2006. It has been prepared in response to a questionnaire devised by the General Rapporteur, Professor Piet Eeckhout, which is reproduced as an Annex. It seeks to do two things: first, to respond to the questions and issues raised by the General Rapporteur, and second to comment on some issues and recent developments which are particularly relevant to the relationship between the European Union and its Member States in the external relations field. These include the obligation on Member States when exercising their own <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> to comply with their Community law obligations, including procedural obligations; issues relating to choice of legal base for external action, and in particular the impact of the pillar structure when characterising EU external action; international responsibility under mixed agreements; and the relationship between international law and EU law...|$|R
40|$|The {{relationship}} between international investment agreements and EU law has attracted increased attention in past few years. The {{aim of this}} thesis is to bring {{a detailed analysis of}} various aspects of this complicated relationship. In attainment of this aim it proceeds in the following steps. After a short introduction (Chapter I.), Chapter II. briefly overviews typical content of bilateral investment treaties, following with a more detailed analysis of relevant EU law rules concerning foreign investment and subsequent comparison of both sets of rules. Chapter III. deals with investment agreements to be concluded by the EU, in particular with questions of <b>external</b> <b>competence</b> for foreign investment, responsibility for breaches of investment agreements concluded by the EU and the future shape of EU investment policy. The status of existing bilateral investment treaties concluded between EU member states and third countries is analyzed in Chapter IV. Chapter V. tackles various issues related to investment treaties concluded between member states (so called intra-EU BITs) ...|$|R
40|$|Trabajo presentado a la EURAM 12 th Conference Theme: Social Innovation for Competitiveness, Organizational Performance and Human Excellence, celebrada en Rotterdam (Holanda) del 6 al 8 de Junio de 2012. In {{order to}} improve product {{innovation}} performance, many companies have developed strategies that include investing heavily in information technologies. However, certain research works challenge its positive relationship with business performance and suggest that others elements may mediate the link. This paper proposes the commercial success of innovation as a dependent variable of information technology competence. Based on the literature on dynamic capabilities’ perspective we propose that internal and <b>external</b> learning <b>competences</b> {{play a key role}} in the relationship between information technology competence and innovation performance. We used structural equations to test the hypotheses in a sample of 186 companies of the ceramic tile industry. The results suggest that IT competency improve innovation performance and this relationship is fully mediated by internal and <b>external</b> learning <b>competence.</b> Peer Reviewe...|$|R
40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo review {{treatment}} options {{in a rare}} type of parotid tumor, in a clinical case study. Case studyA 62 -year-old woman presenting with recurrence of acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid gland with invasion of the skull base was treated by external 3 D conformational radiation, having refused large-scale exeresis. Sixty-six Gy (70 Gy equivalent) were delivered in 2007. Clinical and paraclinical follow-up found regular tumor volume regression over a 2. 5 -year period without side-effects of radiation. DiscussionThere are no specific data on the efficacy of external radiation therapy in acinic cell carcinoma; reports on exclusive radiation treatment of salivary gland cancer include different histological types. Exclusive radiation treatment {{should be at least}} 66 – 70 Gy, preferably by neutron- or hadrontherapy. ConclusionManagement of acinic cell carcinoma of the parotid is surgical with possible secondary radiation therapy; <b>exclusive</b> <b>external</b> radiation therapy is, however, an option in case of contra-indication for surgery or patient refusal...|$|R
