5|$|Iota Trianguli is {{a double}} star whose {{components}} can be separated by medium-sized telescopes into a strong yellow and a contrasting pale blue star. Both of these are themselves close binaries. X Trianguli is an eclipsing binary system that ranges between magnitudes 8.5 and 11.2 {{over a period of}} 0.97 days. RW Trianguli is a cataclysmic variable star system composed of a white dwarf primary and an orange main sequence star of spectral type K7 V. The former <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> off matter from the latter, forming a prominent accretion disc. The system is around 1075 light-years distant.|$|E
5|$|When {{drawing the}} characters, Kishimoto {{consistently}} follows a five-step process: concept and rough sketch, drafting, inking, shading, and coloring. These steps are followed when he <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> the manga {{and making the}} color illustrations that commonly adorn the cover of tankōbon, {{the cover of the}} Weekly Shōnen Jump, or other media, but the toolkit he uses occasionally changes. For instance, he used an airbrush for one illustration for a Weekly Shōnen Jump cover, but decided not to use it for future drawings largely due to the cleanup required.|$|E
5|$|In {{starting}} a motor, a VFD initially applies a low frequency and voltage, thus avoiding high inrush current associated with direct-on-line starting. After {{the start of}} the VFD, the applied frequency and voltage are increased at a controlled rate or ramped up to accelerate the load. This starting method typically allows a motor to develop 150% of its rated torque while the VFD <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> less than 50% of its rated current from the mains in the low-speed range. A VFD can be adjusted to produce a steady 150% starting torque from standstill right up to full speed. However, motor cooling deteriorates and can result in overheating as speed decreases such that prolonged low-speed operation with significant torque is not usually possible without separately motorized fan ventilation.|$|E
5000|$|Assume that an urn {{contains}} two red balls and one green ball. One ball <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> yesterday, one ball <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> today, {{and the final}} ball will <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> tomorrow. All of the <b>draws</b> <b>are</b> [...] "without replacement".|$|R
50|$|On 26 October 2015, {{the first}} round <b>draw</b> <b>was</b> made, Doncaster Rovers <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> at home against Stalybridge Celtic.

50|$|For {{the first}} stage, the 16 {{teams from the}} South Zone <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into eight ties, and the 16 teams from the North Zone <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into the other eight ties. Teams which {{qualified}} for berths 1 <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> against teams which qualified for berths 4, and teams which qualified for berths 2 <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> against teams which qualified for berths 3, with the former hosting the second leg in both cases. Teams from the same association could not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> into the same tie.|$|R
5|$|In {{the final}} dream sequence, Buffy is woken by Anya in her dorm room. She then finds {{herself in her}} room at home, where Tara speaks cryptically about the future. At the university, Buffy talks to her mother, {{who lives in the}} walls, then meets Riley at the Initiative. He has been {{promoted}} to Surgeon General and <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> up plans with Adam (now in ordinary human form) for world domination. The three of them are interrupted by a demon attack, and Riley and Adam start to make a pillow fort. When Buffy finds her weapons bag, the only thing in it is mud, which she smears on her face. She is then transported to the desert and finally confronts the pre-verbal First Slayer; Tara is present to speak for her. Through Tara, the First Slayer tells Buffy that she cannot have friends and must work alone, which Buffy rejects. The Slayers fight in the desert and then in Buffy's living room next to her dying friends until Buffy realizes that she can stop the fight mentally by simply ignoring the First Slayer. She refuses to fight and walks away from the First Slayer; the First Slayer vanishes, and everybody wakes up.|$|E
25|$|Sheet metal drawing becomes {{deep drawing}} when the {{workpiece}} <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> longer than its diameter. It is common that the workpiece is also processed using other forming processes, such as piercing, ironing, necking, rolling, and beading.|$|E
25|$|Another variant {{referred}} to <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> CRE 1116. This is actually externally indistinguishable from a Type 28A {{designed for a}} 6Pdr. The main {{difference is that the}} dividing wall between the main gun chamber and the infantry chamber has been omitted.|$|E
5000|$|Profiles <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> {{either with}} an {{effective}} Earth radius simulated by a parabolic arc--in {{which case the}} ray paths <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> as straight lines--or with a [...] "flat Earth"-- {{in which case the}} ray paths <b>are</b> <b>drawn</b> as parabolic arcs.|$|R
50|$|On 16 June 2015, {{the first}} round <b>draw</b> <b>was</b> made, Ipswich Town <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> at home against Stevenage. Ipswich Town <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> away to Doncaster Rovers in the second round. The third round <b>draw</b> <b>was</b> made on 25 August 2015 live on Sky Sports by Charlie Nicholas and Phil Thompson. Ipswich Town <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> away to Manchester United.|$|R

25|$|Often, several decorations are {{connected}} to a single USB hub, which is limited to 400mA if it has no external power connection and <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> all its power from a host computer. With each device drawing 100mA, it is therefore only possible to run four low-power decorations.|$|E
25|$|As of 2013, the Federal Railroad Administration <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> up {{a master}} plan for {{developing}} the corridor through 2040, taking into account various projects and proposals by various agency and advocacy groups. The plan is to be complete in spring 2015. Much of the proposed improvements are unfunded.|$|E
25|$|With the {{collapse}} of Saddam Hussein's regime, a dark era <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> to a close. And we welcome it... Together we must now build peace in Iraq and for France this has to mean the United Nations having a central role. Together we must build peace throughout the region and {{this can be done}} only through the determined search for a settlement of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict.|$|E
50|$|Each group {{contained}} {{one team}} from Pot 1, one team from Pot 2, and one team from Pot 3. For political reasons, Russia and Ukraine could not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> {{in the same}} group or in groups scheduled to be played {{on the same day}} (due to a potential clash of teams and clash of fans). Therefore, if Russia <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group B, Ukraine had to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group C or D, and if Russia <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group C or D, Ukraine had to <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> in Group A or B.|$|R

50|$|Teams {{from the}} same {{confederation}} <b>were</b> not <b>drawn</b> into the same group, therefore Egypt <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> into Group B. Also as result, Italy and Spain <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> into different groups.|$|R
25|$|As Marvel's G.I. Joe series <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> to a close, Snake Eyes and Cobra Commander finally battle {{each other}} in issue #150. Snake Eyes {{eventually}} wins against an armored Cobra Commander, but the Commander would have the last laugh, as he captures Storm Shadow and successfully brainwashes {{him back to the}} allegiance of Cobra. Snake Eyes and Scarlett would continue to serve G.I. Joe until its disbandment.|$|E
25|$|Kanade is {{the younger}} sister of Tomoki's male friend. A first-year at school, she is {{extremely}} timid and cries often, {{which may be}} the main reason she is teased. One of her hobbies <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> memories from her past. Whilst Kanade already has a brother, she likes to think of the protagonist as a brother, as he would often play games with her when she was a young child.|$|E
25|$|The Strand Races are horse races contested {{annually}} on the Kilkee strand. They first {{began in the}} 19th century on the sand-hills where the golf club is now. The races are normally held over two days in September, when the summer season <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> to a close. The course is made by placing poles {{on the beach and}} when the tide goes out the races begin. Traditionally it was a celebration for farmers when the harvesting season is over.|$|E
5000|$|Clip {{regions are}} {{commonly}} specified to improve render performance. A well-chosen clip allows the renderer {{to save time}} and energy by skipping calculations related to pixels that the user cannot see. Pixels that will <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>are</b> said to be within the clip region. Pixels that will not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>are</b> outside the clip region. More informally, pixels that will not <b>be</b> <b>drawn</b> <b>are</b> said to be [...] "clipped." ...|$|R
5|$|The {{opening and}} ending scenes <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> by Mizushima; the scene {{involving}} {{the debut of}} the film's villain <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Soichi Masui; the middle section of the film <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Shingo Kaneko; Edward Elric's return to his homeworld <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Masahiro Ando; action scenes <b>were</b> <b>drawn</b> by Shinji Aramaki; and the battle between Wrath and Gluttony <b>was</b> <b>drawn</b> by Yutaka Nakamura. Mizushima was repeatedly harassed by the head employees at Aniplex to speed up work on the storyboards. The artwork for the film was produced once Kaneko was finished and cel-animation was used to produce several characters or items in the film. Seven hundred of the film's animated frames had to be redone with only two weeks to the film's release.|$|R
50|$|The {{first round}} <b>draw</b> <b>was</b> made on 8 August 2015, by Women's World Cup bronze medalists Toni Duggan and Alex Scott.

25|$|In {{the opening}} shot, David <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> in his room. The drawing {{is based on}} Stephen King's Dark Tower series, and was painted by film poster {{designer}} Drew Struzan. Darabont also included re-productions of Struzan's posters and illustrations for The Shawshank Redemption, The Green Mile, John Carpenter's The Thing, and Guillermo Del Toro's Pan's Labyrinth. Struzan {{would go on to}} produce a poster for The Mist, but this image was not used in the film's marketing campaign.|$|E
25|$|With the {{development}} of microfabrication and nanotechnology, the study of microfluidics and nanofluidics <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> more attention. Research on microfluidic found its advantages in DNA analysis, lab-on-a-chip, and micro-TAS. Devices in a microfluidic system include channels, valves, mixers, and pumps. Integration of these microfluidic devices enables sorting, transporting, and mixing of substances within fluids. However, the failure of moving parts in these systems is usually the critical issue and the main drawback. Mechanisms to control flow without using mechanical parts are always desired for reliability and lifetime.|$|E
25|$|The frame {{contains}} {{scenes of}} the Life of Jesus: from the lower left, the Prayer in the Garden, The Arrest, Christ in Front of Pilatus, the Flagellation, the Coronation of Thorns, the Via Crucis and, finally, the Crucifixion. In the sky around the cross are a flying angel and a devil, with a red halo around his head, who <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> Judas Iscariot's soul away. Judas is also visible hanging at the mountain's right edge, while a man is pointing at him.|$|E

25|$|The game borrows its {{elements}} from the Scene It? DVD game franchise and is hosted by Genie {{from the film}} Aladdin who introduces and gives results for each round. Each game contains 15 rounds and takes about 30–40 minutes to play. Some rounds require watching clips without the sound, and some where players have to answer trivia questions about Disney films, and some where players have to guess what the artist <b>is</b> <b>drawing.</b> Disney Think Fast is currently the only game developed by Magenta Software that has been released for the Wii.|$|E
25|$|Even {{prior to}} the {{implementation}} of NAFTA, Tijuana was home to many businesses selling products and services at a lower rate than in the United States. Today businesses such as auto detailing, medical services, dentistry and plastic surgery are heavily marketed and located near Tijuana's border with San Diego. In addition, there are high-tech firms and telemarketing companies, including Medtronic Inc., in the city. This influx of companies <b>is</b> <b>drawing</b> skilled people from the United States with technical trades and college degrees to Tijuana transforming the city economy into a knowledge-based one.|$|E
