40|$|Simulating {{the impact}} of debris flows on {{structures}} and exploring the feasibility of applying energy dissipation devices or shock isolators to reduce {{the damage caused by}} debris flows can make great contribution to the design of disaster prevention structures. In this paper, we propose a new type of device, a lateral <b>damping</b> <b>buffer,</b> to reduce the vulnerability of building structures to debris flows. This lateral <b>damping</b> <b>buffer</b> has two mechanisms of damage mitigation: when debris flows impact on a building, it acts as a buffer, and when the structure vibrates due to the impact, it acts as a shock absorber, which can reduce the maximum acceleration response and subsequent vibration respectively. To study the effectiveness of such a lateral <b>damping</b> <b>buffer,</b> an impact test is conducted, which mainly involves a lateral <b>damping</b> <b>buffer</b> attached to a two-degree-of-freedom structure under a simulated debris flow load. To enable the numerical study, the equation of motion of the structure along with the lateral <b>damping</b> <b>buffer</b> is derived. A subsequent parametric study is performed to optimize the lateral <b>damping</b> <b>buffer.</b> Finally, a practical design procedure is also provided...|$|E
40|$|The {{interaction}} between rotor wake turbulence and stators {{is a major}} source of fan broadband noise. This paper presents a method on how to obtain the low to medium frequencies using a hybrid RANS/LES method. Three stator vanes are discretized and the mean rotor wake is specified at the inlet. Synthetic fluctuations are also added to the inlet profile to trigger the flow into turbulent mode. Chorochronic periodic boundary conditions combined with temporally <b>damped</b> <b>buffer</b> zones (chorochronic buffer zones) are used {{to make sure that the}} deterministic part of the wake interaction is taken care of properly. The combination of chorochronic periodicity and buffer zones in the area close to the pitch-wise boundaries efficiently filters the flow field from turbulence generated stochastic fluctuations. The center blade in the domain is relatively unaffected by the filtering effect and the unsteady pressure field, deterministic and turbulence generated, can be used as a source for both tone and broadband noise. The paper also include a comparison between the proposed method and a simulation with modified blade count and standard periodic boundaries. The tone noise will change when the number of blades is modified but the aim is to see whether this has a significant effect on broadband noise...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. In {{order to}} analyze {{impacting}} {{characteristics of a}} metro vehicle, the impacting governing Eq. is established, in which, nonlinear stiffness and <b>damping</b> of a <b>buffer,</b> friction force between rail and wheel of the vehicles is considered. In terms of testing results, nonlinear stiffness and <b>damping</b> of the <b>buffers</b> is simulated. By numerical simulation, {{it is found that}} when moving trainset impacts standing trainset, because the impacting force, stroke of buffers located in impacting interface is the maximum, the capacity of the buffers must be large enough to avoid rigid impact; when trainset with different number vehicles impacts each other, the maximum impacting force is not only different from each other, but the stroke and energy dissipation of the buffers is also different; the capacity of buffers far from impacting interface may be small...|$|R

40|$|Presented in {{this paper}} is an {{approach}} to the optimal design of a buffer for a <b>buffered</b> impact <b>damper.</b> The <b>buffer</b> of a <b>buffered</b> impact <b>damper</b> is modelled as a spring-damper pair. For a <b>buffered</b> impact <b>damper</b> to achieve effective vibration control {{and at the same}} time eliminate the inherent disadvantage of the conventional impact damper (i. e. high contact force resulting from impact and high acceleration and noise resulting from high contact force), the design of the buffer is formulated so as to maximize the impulse of impact, thus maximizing the momentum exchange between the damper mass and the primary structure to be controlled, subject to a limit on the maximum impact force. This problem is solved via the production of a design chart. Experiments and numerical simulations demonstrate that the impact <b>damper</b> with the <b>buffer</b> produced from this design approach can not only significantly reduce the contact force and peak value of the acceleration generated by collisions, but also enhance the vibration control effect, which makes it ideal and applicable for general engineering applications.

40|$|Objectives] Considering the {{shortcomings}} of the traditional sheave <b>damper</b> in <b>buffer</b> performance and the peak value of the greatest cable tension, [Methods] this paper presents a sheave damper with variable damping according to piston displacement {{as a replacement for}} the traditional sheave damper, and AMESim software is used for the modeling and simulation. [Results] The results show that the new sheave damper can significantly improve the arresting gear performance indicators, and has better adaptability for aircraft impact load. Compared with the traditional sheave damper, the new method can reduce cable tension by 25 % and reduce the maximum deceleration of aircraft by 23 %. [Conclusions] As such, the research in this paper can provide a theoretical reference for improving the performance of aircraft arresting gear...|$|R
40|$|Suspension seat end-stop impacts may be {{a source}} of {{increased}} risk of injury for the drivers of some machines and work vehicles, such as off-road vehicles. Most suspension seats use rubber buffers to reduce the severity of end-stop impacts, but they still result in a high magnitude of acceleration being transmitted to drivers when an end-stop impact occurs. An experimental study has been conducted to investigate the effect of buffer stiffness and <b>buffer</b> <b>damping</b> on the severity of end-stop impacts. The results show that the end-stop impact performance of suspension seats with only bottom buffers can be improved by the use of both top and bottom buffers. The force-deflection characteristics of rubber buffers had a significant influence on the severity of end-stop impacts. The optimum buffer should have medium stiffness which is nearly linear and occurs over a long deflection, without being compressed to its high stiffness stage. It is shown, theoretically, that <b>buffer</b> <b>damping</b> is capable of significantly reducing the severity of end-stop impacts. However, since current rubber material provides only low damping, alternative materials to those in current use, or either passive or active damping devices, are required. © 1998 Academic Press. </p...|$|R

40|$|AbstractBased on the {{structure}} of a certain type of aviation axial-piston pump’s valve plate which adopts a pre-pressurization fluid path (consisting a <b>damping</b> hole, a <b>buffer</b> chamber, and an orifice) to reduce flow ripple, a single-piston model of the aviation axial-piston pump is presented. This single-piston model comprehensively considers fluid compressibility, orifice restriction effect, fluid resistance in the capillary tube, and the leakage flow. Besides, the instantaneous discharge areas used in the single-piston model have been calculated in detail. Based on the single-piston model, a multi-piston pump model has been established according to the simple hydraulic circuit. The single- and multi-piston pump models have been realized by the S-function in Matlab/Simulink. The developed multi-piston pump model has been validated by being compared with the numerical result by computational fluid dynamic (CFD). The effects of the pre-pressurization fluid path on the flow ripple and the instantaneous pressure in the piston chamber have been studied and optimized design recommendations for the aviation axial-piston pump have been given out...|$|R
40|$|Acoustic waves {{propagating}} through nonuniform flows {{are subject}} to convection and refraction. Most noise prediction schemes use a linear wave operator to capture these effects. However, the wave operator can also support instability waves that, for a jet, are the well-known Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities. These are convective instabilities that can completely overwhelm the acoustic solution downstream of the source location. A general technique to filter out the instability waves is presented. A mathematical analysis is presented that demonstrates that the instabilities are suppressed if a time-harmonic response is assumed, and the governing equations are solved by a direct solver in the frequency domain. Also, a buffer-zone treatment for a nonreflecting boundary condition implementation in the frequency domain is developed. The outgoing waves are <b>damped</b> in the <b>buffer</b> zone simply by adding imaginary values of appropriate sign to the required real frequency of the response. An analytical solution to a one-dimensional model problem, as well as numerical and analytical solutions to a two-dimensional jet instability problem, are provided. They demonstrate the effectiveness, robustness, and simplicity of the present technique...|$|R
30|$|In recent years, Zhao et al. [12] {{developed}} a novel non-pneumatic wheel called the mechanical elastic wheel (ME-Wheel). The ME-Wheel {{consists of three}} parts, the flexible tire body, hinge unit and suspension hub. In order to improve the adaptability of military vehicles in complex environment, the ME-Wheel is designed with a statically indeterminate structure. Compared with the conventional pneumatic tire, the ME-Wheel will not have potential risk factors such as flat tire or leakage. Moreover, the double <b>buffered</b> <b>damping</b> structure adopted by the ME-Wheel gives it excellent comfort. The ME-Wheel’s structure and vehicle ride comfort was analyzed by Wang et al. [13]. Wang et al. [14] analyzed the relationship among the excitation frequency, radial deformation, bending stiffness of combined elastic rings, and combined elastic rings’ laminated structure parameters. Zang et al. [15 – 17] analyzed the influence of conditions on the radial stiffness of the ME-Wheel. Li et al. [18] studied the mechanical properties of the ME-Wheels with Laplace transform and obtained {{the relationship between the}} tangential deformation and bending angle of the combined elastic rings. Du et al. [19] established a nonlinear three-dimensional finite element wheel–soil interaction model, and simulations with different rotational speeds of the ME-Wheel were conducted.|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a new type}} of subterranean habitat associated with dry watercourses in the Eastern Iberian Peninsula, the "Alluvial Mesovoid Shallow Substratum" (alluvial MSS). Historical observations and data from field sampling specially designed to study MSS fauna in the streambeds of temporary watercourses support the description of this new habitat. To conduct the sampling, 16 subterranean sampling devices were placed in a region of Eastern Spain. The traps were operated for 12 months and temperature and relative humidity data were recorded to characterise the habitat. A large number of species was captured, many of which belonged to the arthropod group, with marked hygrophilous, geophilic, lucifugous and mesothermal habits. In addition, there was also a substantial number of species showing markedly ripicolous traits. The results confirm that the network of spaces which forms in alluvial deposits of temporary watercourses merits the category of habitat, and here we propose the name of "alluvial MSS". The "alluvial MSS" may be covered or not by a layer of soil, is extremely <b>damp,</b> provides a <b>buffer</b> against above ground temperatures and is aphotic.

40|$|A {{complete}} {{understanding of}} the noise generation mechanisms is prerequisite to reducing aircraft jet noise. A computationally intensive large eddy simulation (LES) can help directly predict the noise. For this purpose, the Ansys-Fluent LES tool is evaluated for its modeling accuracy and computational cost. A satisfactory computational methodology is developed first by studying a canonical problem. A mixing layer at a Reynolds number of 720 is simulated using LES in two- and three-dimensions without the splitter plate walls and is studied extensively to gain insights of the flow physics. The effects of inflow-forcing and the buffer-zone at the domain exit incorporated in 2 -D LES are investigated. The flow is <b>damped</b> in the <b>buffer</b> zone without explicitly introducing the damping terms and {{is found to be}} satisfactory for the current work. The instabilities of the 2 -D mixing layer are captured well using random inflow-forcing. The buffer-zone is found to help the prediction of the Reynolds stresses near the exit boundary. The sensitivity of the 2 -D results to timestep, sampling time and grid is also studied. The 2 -D grid is, then, optimized to construct a mesh for 3 -D LES. The deficiencies of Fluent’s in-built vortex method (VM) algorithm to force perturbations in 3 -D are discussed. An adapted VM algorithm is implemented and is found to predict the three-dimensional instabilities of the mixing layer well. The energy spectrum of the LES computations indicate that the second-order-accurate bounded central differencing scheme, used in the present study, is adequate for modeling turbulent flows. The computational resources to perform a realistic jet simulation are also estimated. ...|$|R
