5|$|All {{members of}} Cicuta except C.bulbifera contain {{high levels of}} the {{poisonous}} principle cicutoxin, an unsaturated aliphatic alcohol that is structurally {{closely related to the}} toxin oenanthotoxin found in the plant hemlock water dropwort. Cicutoxin is present at all stages of growth and {{in all parts of the}} plant, but is most concentrated in the roots which appear to be the most toxic in the early spring. Its primary toxic effect is to act as a stimulant in the central nervous system. It is a non-competitive gamma-aminobutyric acid (GABA) receptor antagonist. Cicutoxin acts on the GABAA receptor causing a block of the chloride channel which results in neuronal <b>depolarization.</b> In the presence of cicutoxin this <b>depolarization</b> continues unabated causing cell overactivity. The hyperactivity in brain cells results in seizures. Cicutoxin is highly poisonous and water hemlock is considered one of North America's most toxic plants. Ingestion of Cicuta can be fatal in humans and there are reports in the medical literature of severe poisoning and death as early as 1670. A number of people have also died following ingestion of the plant in the 20th and 21st century.|$|E
5|$|LTP can {{be induced}} either by strong tetanic {{stimulation}} {{of a single}} pathway to a synapse, or cooperatively via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic <b>depolarization</b> to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic.|$|E

Subarachnoid hemorrhage was induced by endovascular puncture of the right internal carotid bifurcation. After one day, brain tissue damage was measured with T 2 -weighted MRI, followed by application of 1 M KCl (SD group, N = 16) or saline (no-SD group, N = 16) to the right cortex. Cortical laser-Doppler flowmetry was performed to record spreading <b>depolarizations.</b> MRI was repeated on day 3, after which brains were extracted for assessment of subarachnoid hemorrhage severity and histological damage. 5. 0 ± 2. 7 spreading <b>depolarizations</b> were recorded in the SD group. Subarachnoid hemorrhage severity and mortality were similar between the SD and no-SD groups. Subarachnoid hemorrhage-induced brain lesions expanded between days 1 and 3.

5|$|The {{vagus nerve}} is a long, {{wandering}} nerve {{that emerges from}} the brainstem and provides parasympathetic stimulation to {{a large number of}} organs in the thorax and abdomen, including the heart. The nerves from the sympathetic trunk emerge through the T1-T4 thoracic ganglia and travel to both the sinoatrial and atrioventricular nodes, {{as well as to the}} atria and ventricles. The ventricles are more richly innervated by sympathetic fibers than parasympathetic fibers. Sympathetic stimulation causes the release of the neurotransmitter norepinephrine (also known as noradrenaline) at the neuromuscular junction of the cardiac nerves. This shortens the repolarization period, thus speeding the rate of <b>depolarization</b> and contraction, which results in an increased heart rate. It opens chemical or ligand-gated sodium and calcium ion channels, allowing an influx of positively charged ions. Norepinephrine binds to the beta–1 receptor.|$|E

40|$|The {{effects of}} a {{putative}} gap junction uncoupling agent, heptanol, on the intracellularly recorded junction potentials of the guinea-pig isolated vas deferens have been investigated. After the stimulation-evoked excitatory junction potentials (EJPs) had been suppressed by heptanol (2. 0 mm) to undetectable levels, a different pattern of evoked activity ensued. This consisted of transient <b>depolarizations</b> that were similar to EJPs in being stimulus locked and in occurring at a fixed latency, but differed from EJPs in that they occurred intermittently and had considerably briefer time courses. Analysis of the amplitudes and temporal parameters of the rapid residual <b>depolarizations</b> revealed a close similarity with spontaneous EJPs (SEJPs). There was {{no statistically significant difference}} between the rise times, time constants of decay and durations of the rapid residual <b>depolarizations</b> and of SEJPs. Selected evoked <b>depolarizations</b> were virtually identical to SEJPs occurring in the same cell. Evoked <b>depolarizations</b> of closely similar amplitude and time course also occurred, usually within a few stimuli of each other. These <b>depolarizations</b> appear to represent the individual quantal <b>depolarizations</b> that normally underlie the EJP and are therefore termed ‘quantal excitatory junction potentials’ (QEJPs) to distinguish them from both EJPs and SEJPs. We examined the possibility that heptanol revealed QEJPs by disrupting electrical coupling between cells in the smooth muscle syncytium. Heptanol (2. 0 mm) had no effect on the amplitude distribution, time courses, or the frequency of occurrence of SEJPs. Intracellular input impedance (Rin) of smooth muscle cells was left unaltered by heptanol. ‘Cable’ potentials of the vas deferens, recorded using the partition stimulation method, also remained unchanged in the presence of heptanol. Thus, heptanol appeared not to modify syncytial electrical properties of the smooth muscle in any significant way. Our observations show directly that the quantal <b>depolarizations</b> underlying the EJP in syncytial smooth muscle are SEJP-like events.

Using cell-attached patch-pipette recordings in the somata and apical dendrites of CA 1 pyramidal neurons, we determined the properties of slow inactivation on response to trains of brief <b>depolarizations.</b> We find {{that the amount of}} slow inactivation gradually increases as a function of distance from the soma. Slow inactivation is also frequency and voltage dependent. Higher frequency <b>depolarizations</b> increase both the amount of slow inactivation and its rate of recovery.

We compare this form of slow inactivation to that reported in other cell types, using longer <b>depolarizations,</b> and construct a simplified biophysical model to examine the possible gating mechanisms underlying slow inactivation. Our results suggest that sodium channels can enter slow inactivation rapidly from the open state during brief <b>depolarizations</b> or slowly from a fast inactivation state during longer <b>depolarizations.</b> Because of these properties of slow inactivation, sodium channels will modulate neuronal excitability in a way that depends in a complicated manner on the resting potential and previous history of action potential firing...|$|R

Hexamethonium or mecamylamine completely blocked <b>depolarizations</b> caused by acetylcholine (ACh) applied by ionophoresis.

These experiments support the co-transport theory but suggest somewhat different mechanisms for the transport of the neutral, acidic, and basic amino acids. We suggest that the neutral amino acids are co-transported with a single H+ and that accumulation depends upon both the ΔpH and the membrane potential components of the proton motive force. The acidic amino acids appear to be accumulated by a similar mechanism except that the transport of each molecule may be associated with a cation in addition to a single proton.
