40|$|<b>Impurity</b> <b>profiling</b> is {{the process}} of {{acquiring}} and evaluating data that establishes biological safety of an individual impurity; thus, revealing its need and scope in pharmaceutical research. There is no clear definition for impurity in the pharmaceutical world. <b>Impurity</b> <b>profiling</b> includes identification, structure elucidation and quantitative determination of impurities and degradation products in bulk drug materials and pharmaceutical formulations. <b>Impurity</b> <b>profiling</b> has gained importance in modern pharmaceutical analysis {{due to the fact that}} unidentified, potentially toxic impurities are hazardous to health and in order to increase the safety of drug therapy, impurities should be identified and determined by selective methods. Terms such as residual solvents, byproduct, transformation products, degradation products, interaction products and related products are frequently used to define impurities. Identification of impurities is done by variety of Chromatographic and Spectroscopic techniques, either alone or in combination with other techniques. The advent of hyphenated techniques has revolutionized <b>impurity</b> <b>profiling,</b> by not only separation but structural identification of impurities as well.

To that end, the physical and chemical characteristics of samples are analysed: their colour, the packaging material, including fingerprints, diacetylmorphine (heroin) content and the composition of some main alkaloids. At the beginning of 2002, having acquired expertise on <b>impurity</b> <b>profiling</b> and with the support of new instruments, the Institute of Forensic Sciences of Viet Nam introduced the routine <b>impurity</b> <b>profiling</b> of seized heroin and methamphetamine and later undertook to explain that process to national law enforcement bodies.

Also, a series of N-alkyl derivatives of the amphetamines were prepared with a view to their pharmacological evaluation. Chapter 1 of this thesis presents a brief history of amphetamine, its related designer drugs and the structure-activity relationships of the phenylalkylamines.
