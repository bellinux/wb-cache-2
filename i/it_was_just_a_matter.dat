500|$|When {{deciding}} on musicians {{to perform on}} the album, Moore said that he [...] "picked people who were around". His girlfriend, Bige Akdeniz, performed vocals, Theron Patterson did programming and Patterson's drum teacher, Utku Ünal, performed the drums. The only musician Moore actively sought out was guitarist Erdem Helvacıoğlu, who performed on one track. Moore noted {{that none of the}} music was technically demanding, [...] "it's just more of a feel that we’re going for so <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of getting comfortable and getting in the mood and playing stuff together." ...|$|E
500|$|Case, who had {{previously}} worked on the soap operas General Hospital and As the World Turns, was cast in August 1994. She was selected {{from a group of}} six other possible recasts after a screen testing with co-star Joshua Morrow, and began airing on September 7, 1994. Initially, Case believed she would only be playing the role for a maximum of six months. Of her casting, she stated: [...] "Not only is this my third soap, but I'm also the third actress {{to play the role of}} Sharon Collins. So, if three times is the charm, this should be it." [...] The actress wanted to [...] "breathe new life" [...] into the role and make it her own. In 2003, Case was off-screen from February 17 to May 1, during contract negotiations. These were resolved that April, when she signed a new contract to remain on the show for another four years, until 2007. Case revealed that while she considered leaving the series, [...] "I would not have been negotiating if I did not want to come back. I've always had a great story to play. I love the way they write Sharon. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of hammering out the deal points." ...|$|E

It was an indiscernible difference... <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of looking at the schedule and what looked better". [...] "In the end, NY won that particular duel simply because it features New York City, which helped CBS create a Friday night NYC-fest".|$|E

2500|$|In 1938, Avis was {{diagnosed}} with tuberculosis. She died later that year, {{at the age of}} 58. Of his loss, Blake said, [...] "In my life I never knew what it was to be alone. At first when Avis got sick, I thought she just had a cold, but when time passed and she didn’t get better, I made her go to a doctor and we found out she had TB … I suppose I knew from when we found out she had the TB, I understood that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time." ...|$|E
2500|$|Sam Kellerman was 29 years old. In {{speaking}} about his brother, Max Kellerman recalls that [...] " [...] was a creative genius... He {{was the best}} writer for his age I've ever read. I used to tell him, 'I'll {{always be able to}} get someone to pay me for talking, and you'll always be able to get someone to pay you for writing.' When it came to writing, I felt like Salieri to Sam's Mozart. Sam wanted to direct film, but I think he was fated to write and be in front of the camera. He was starting to get work as an actor. He was in several national commercials. And acting wasn't even what he did best. Sam was a sure thing. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before he made it big." ...|$|E
2500|$|Vice Admiral William P.

They'd be thirty or forty pounds heavier than he was, but that didn't bother him at all. He was there for two years, which was probably about a year too long, because morale was getting pretty low. As I told Admiral Burke, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before {{someone was going to}} slug him. You can't operate like that. Admiral Felt wasn't big enough to defend himself. I said that one of these days he's going to come at someone who's going to wipe up the corridor with him, regardless of how many stars he has." ...|$|E

2500|$|One {{of these}} new readers was a young {{suburban}} Indianapolis teacher {{by the name of}} Hulda Augusta Eickhoff. [...] Impressed by the solid message and zestful writing style of the articles signed only with the initials “W.A.M.”, Miss Eickhoff decided to join the Walther League and become a part of their vision. Soon Hulda was elected secretary of the Indianapolis chapter. Her program material had to be approved by “W.A.M.” in Milwaukee, who became as smitten with her writing as she was with his. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time before the handsome twenty-seven-year-old national secretary met the secretary of the Indianapolis chapter; a slender brunette with expressive brown eyes and sparkling smile who was destined to become his bride. [...] Married in 1924, they eventually had two sons: Walter A. Maier II, born in 1925; and Paul L. Maier, born in 1929. Maier continued in his capacity as editor of the Messenger through 1945.|$|E
2500|$|Inspired by a {{performance}} of Japanese taiko drummers Witer formed Big Pig: [...] "When I saw them, the key to it was orchestration – that each guy had his own part. There was no improvisation at all. So from that point on, I {{knew how to do}} it. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of getting the right people". The initial incarnation involved eight or nine drummers, with Witer trying to sing over the poly-rhythmic din; while members of the band came and went. At an early gig Witer's former band mate, Sherine Abeyratne, attended and subsequently joined the ensemble. As a vocalist, she {{had been a member of}} various groups: Grand Wazoo, The Editions, Bang, Big Choir, Bob Starkie Shape Up, Gospel Truth, Jo Jo Zep Band, Black Coffee, Dianna Boss and The Extremes, and The Rock Party. In 1988 Sherine recalled [...] "I started joining bands eight years ago, as long as the music was high-energy, really strong, that was the criterion". She had also toured with INXS as a backing vocalist. Another early member was Nick Disbray on vocals and percussion.|$|E
2500|$|I {{had these}} pieces, these guitar pieces, that I {{wanted to put}} together. I had a whole idea {{of a piece of}} music that I really wanted to try and present to {{everybody}} and try and come to terms with. Bit difficult really, because it started on acoustic, and as you know it goes through to the electric parts. But we had various run-throughs [...] where I was playing the acoustic guitar and jumping up and picking up the electric guitar. Robert was sitting in the corner, or rather leaning against the wall, and as I was routining the rest of the band with this idea and this piece, he was just writing. And {{all of a sudden he}} got up and started singing, along with another run-through, and he must have had 80% of the words there ... I had these sections, and I knew what order they were going to go in, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of getting everybody to feel comfortable with each gear shift that was going to be coming.|$|E

2500|$|The {{writer of}} Earth 2, Tom Taylor, {{specifically}} resurrected Lois Lane on Earth 2 {{after he was}} told to kill off the character in the Injustice comic series. Taylor stated [...] "bringing Lois in was quite a personal thing, because having to do such horrible, horrible things to her in Injustice, the first thing I asked when I got on the book was if I could bring back Lois. Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of working out exactly how." [...] Taylor received [...] "Women in Refrigerators" [...] criticism for his Injustice comic stories. Bringing back Lois as Red Tornado was Taylor's way to [...] "unfridge" [...] Lois. As Taylor noted, in Lois' first appearance as Red Tornado, Lois literally came out of a blue refrigerator. Other reasons for bringing back Lois involve Superman, Taylor commented [...] "While evil bastard Superman is out there killing and maiming and destroying, I wanted Lois to exist as the counterpoint to this. She's the beating heart at the center. She's the good Ying to Superman's evil Yang. Where there's Lois, there's hope." ...|$|E
2500|$|On 4 July 1941, Caldwell saw a German pilot {{shoot and}} kill a close friend, Pilot Officer Donald Munro, who was {{descending}} {{to the ground}} in a parachute. This was a controversial practice, but was nevertheless common among some German and Allied pilots. One biographer, Kristin Alexander, suggests that it may have caused Caldwell's attitude to harden significantly. Months later, press officers and journalists popularised Caldwell's nickname of [...] "Killer", which he disliked. One reason for the nickname was that he too shot enemy airmen after they parachuted out of aircraft. Caldwell commented many years later: [...] "... there was no blood lust or anything about it like that. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of not wanting them back to have another go at us. I never shot any who landed where they could be taken prisoner." [...] (In later life, Caldwell said that his thoughts often turned to one Japanese airman or passenger, who survived Caldwell's last aerial victory but could not be rescued.) A more commonly cited reason for the nickname was his habit of using up ammunition left over at the end of sorties, to shoot up enemy troop convoys and vehicles. During his war service, Caldwell wrote in a notebook: [...] "it's your life or theirs. This is war." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both Kate Blanchard and Scholz {{note that}} there are several {{passages}} in the Book of Isaiah, Book of Jeremiah, and Book of Ezekiel that utilize rape metaphors. Blanchard expressed outrage over this fact, writing [...] "The translations of these shining examples of victim-blaming are clear enough, despite the old-fashioned language: I'm angry and you're going to suffer for it. You deserve to be raped because of your sexual exploits. You're a slut and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of time till you suffered the consequences. Let this be a lesson {{to you and to}} all other uppity women." [...] Scholz discussed four passages—Isaiah 3:16-17, Jeremiah 13:22 and 26, Ezekiel 16, and Ezekiel 23. On Isaiah, Scholz wrote that there is a common mistranslation of the Hebrew word pōt as [...] "forehead" [...] or [...] "scalp". Also often translated as [...] "genitals", Scholz believes that a more accurate translation of the word in context is [...] "cunt". Regarding Jeremiah, Scholz wrote, [...] "The poem proclaims that the woman brought this fate upon herself and she is to be blamed for it, while the prophet sides with the sexually violent perpetrators, viewing the attack as deserved and God as justifying it. Rape poetics endorses 'masculine authoritarianism' and the 'dehumanization of women,' perhaps especially when the subject is God." ...|$|E

2500|$|In {{the four}} Tests, sixteen catches were dropped, with around 60 dropped {{in a total}} of 12 {{first-class}} matches, while the tired pace spearhead Graham McKenzie took 1/333 and was thought to be suffering from hepatitis. Behind the scenes, the South African Cricket Board approached the Australian Cricket Board attempting to organise a Fifth Test. The players were unreceptive to this after spending five months overseas in what was then an amateur sport. The proposed extra match fell through after a pay standoff led behind the scenes by Ian Chappell, later to spearhead the breakaway World Series Cricket (WSC), which offered players substantial remuneration. The dispute was the genesis of WSC, and on the team's return to Australia, Lawry sent the Board a letter expressing player grievances. According to Chappell, [...] "That was the end of Lawry as captain of Australia. Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of finding any excuse to get rid of him." [...] Lawry was largely ineffective, with 193 runs at 24.13 with only one half century in the First Test. Apart from media criticism of the team's performances, Lawry was also slated for refusing to make a speech {{at the end of the}} series and refusing a gift from an umpire at the end of the Fourth Test. Lawry also had personal differences with Ian Chappell, Doug Walters, Ashley Mallett and Brian Taber, which reduced morale and led to a deterioration in Australia's performances on the field.|$|E
2500|$|Bill Lawry succeeded {{his opening}} partner Bobby Simpson as Australian captain {{midway through the}} victorious 4-0 series victory over India in 1967-68, he {{retained}} the Ashes 1-1 in 1968 and defeated the West Indies 3-1 in 1968-69. The 1969-70 the tour of India was successful - [...] Australia won 3-1 - but the non-smoking, non-drinking Lawry had little time for the social side of the tour, was unable to maintain good public relations and manager Fred Bennett submitted an unfavourable report. In the subsequent tour of South Africa he lost 4-0 and he sent the Australian Cricket Board a list of player grievances. According to vice-captain Ian Chappell, [...] "That {{was the end of}} Lawry as captain of Australia. Then <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>just</b> <b>a</b> <b>matter</b> of finding any excuse to get rid of him". In 1970-71 he was determined to retain the Ashes, but chose to do this by batting every match into a draw and was criticised by his cautious, negative captaincy. With a victory required in the final Test to even the series and retain The Ashes the selectors dismissed Lawry, the first time an Australian captain had been dropped in mid-series. They failed to inform Lawry, who heard the news on the radio and was soon besieged by reporters. He accepted the verdict with his usual stoicism, but {{it was the end of}} his Test career and Australia lost a great opening batsman aged only 33. His successor Ian Chappell was far more aggressive and inspirational captain, but lost the last Test and with it The Ashes. However he recreated the Australian team in his own image and by 1974-75 it would be the most powerful Test team in the world.|$|E
