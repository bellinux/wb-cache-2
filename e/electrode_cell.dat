50|$|When a three <b>electrode</b> <b>cell</b> is used {{to perform}} electroanalytical chemistry, the {{auxiliary}} electrode, along with the working electrode, provides circuit over which current is either applied or measured. Here, {{the potential of the}} auxiliary electrode is usually not measured and is adjusted so as to balance the reaction occurring at the working electrode.

This electrochemical reaction results in an electric current that passes through the external circuit. In addition to measuring, amplifying and performing other signal processing functions, the external circuit maintains the voltage across the sensor between the working and counter electrodes for a two electrode sensor or between the working and reference electrodes for a three <b>electrode</b> <b>cell.</b> At the counter electrode an equal and opposite reaction occurs, such that if the working electrode is an oxidation, then the counter electrode is a reduction.|$|E

The dry sinter process <b>electrode</b> <b>cells</b> tested {{are similar to the}} onboard HST NiH 2 cells. The slurry process <b>electrode</b> <b>cells</b> were developed to be less susceptible to electrode expansion and impedance changes with life. Both cell types were impregnated by the aqueous electrochemical process. Test conditions included standard capacity tests and electrical cycling using 96 -minute cycling regimens incorporating gr depth-of-discharge (DOD) cycles. The dry sinter process electrodes have higher operating capacities to 1. 20 V/cell, but both electrode types have similar heat dissipation for the conditions tested. The results of the testing included cyclic heat generation during a typical 96 -minute cycle, operating capacity data vs. cutoff voltage to generate a temperature-compensated voltage curve, and voltage characteristics suitable to develop a voltage prediction model.

30|$|It {{should be}} noted that the same Si/alloy {{electrode}} material showed very different electrochemical behavior with different calendering. All the calendered electrode cells showed stable cycling behavior compared to the not-pressed <b>electrode</b> <b>cell,</b> but the overall capacity was lower with increasing calendering pressure due to reduced electrolyte wettability. Although the capacities are lowered, the stable cycle behavior with calendering would also make it easier to design high-density full cell batteries. In this case, 3 -ton pressed Si/alloy <b>electrode</b> <b>cell</b> with a considerable capacity tradeoff showed high density and excellent cycle stability compared to the not-pressed Si/alloy <b>electrode</b> <b>cell.</b> Electrodes densification improves the particle-to-particle connections with pressing. However, the electrochemical performance is affected due to reduced electrolyte wettability and reduced electrochemical activity indicating the need for densification control and wettability optimization. Si/alloy electrodes with 5 and 8 tons pressed also showed stable cycling, but the capacities are very low to be considered. Therefore, optimization and balancing between the calendering pressure and electrolyte wettability property can help tune to the best electrochemical properties of the battery materials.|$|E

40|$|An {{open-ended}} {{cylindrical cell}} {{with a single}} annular trap electrode located {{at the center of}} the excitation and detection region is demonstrated for Fourier transform ion cyclotron resonance mass spectrometry. A trapping well is created by applying a static potential to the trap electrode of polarity opposite the charge of the ion to be trapped, after which conventional dipolar excitation and detection are performed. The annular trap electrode is axially narrow to allow the creation of a potential well without excessively shielding excitation and detection. Trapping is limited to the region of homogeneous excitation at the cell centerline without the use of capacitive coupling. Perfluorotributylamine excitation profiles demonstrate negligible axial ejection throughout the entire excitation voltage range even at an effective centerline potential of only − 0. 009 V. High mass resolving power in the single-trap <b>electrode</b> <b>cell</b> is demonstrated by achievement of mass resolving power of 1. 45 × 106 for benzene during an experiment in which ions created in a high pressure source cubic cell are transferred to the low pressure analyzer single-trap <b>electrode</b> <b>cell</b> for detection. Such high performance is attributed to the negligible radius dependent radial electric field for ions cooled to the center of the potential well and accelerated to less than 60 % of the cell radius. An important distinction of the single-trap electrode geometry from all previous open and closed cell arrangements is exhibition of combined gated and accumulated trapping. Because there is no potential barrier, all ions penetrate into the trapping region regardless of their translational energy as in gated trapping, but additional ions may accumulate over time, as in accumulated trapping. Ions of low translational kinetic energy are demonstrated to be preferentially trapped in the single-trap <b>electrode</b> <b>cell.</b> In a further demonstration of the minimal radial electric field of the single-trap <b>electrode</b> <b>cell,</b> positive voltages can be applied to the annular trap electrode as well as the source cell trap electrode to achieve highly efficient transfer of ions between cells...|$|E
