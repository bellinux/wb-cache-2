5|$|The Seinfeld Chronicles {{was written}} as the pilot {{for the show}} that would {{eventually}} be called Seinfeld, though earlier versions of the script would refer to the program as Stand Up and The <b>Jerry</b> <b>Seinfeld</b> Show. The idea for the show started on November 2, 1988, after NBC executives had approached comedian <b>Jerry</b> <b>Seinfeld</b> to do a project with the network, upon a suggestion by George Shapiro, Seinfeld's manager at the time. Seinfeld enlisted fellow comedian Larry David to help him develop it, and they wrote a concept for a special about where comedians get their material. However, upon further discussion, Seinfeld felt that the concept could not be sustained for 90 minutes, upon which the two decided that the project {{was to become a}} pilot for a TV-series, rather than a special. Developed by NBC executive Rick Ludwin, and produced by Castle Rock Entertainment, it was a mix of Seinfeld's stand-up comedy routines and idiosyncratic, conversational scenes focusing on mundane aspects of everyday life.|$|E

5|$|In their {{original}} contracts {{for the first}} season, cast members were paid $22,500 per episode. The cast members received different salaries in the second season, beginning from the $20,000 range to $40,000 per episode. Before their salary negotiations for the third season, the cast decided to enter collective negotiations, despite Warner Bros.' preference for individual deals. The actors were given the salary of the least-paid cast member, meaning Aniston and Schwimmer had their salaries reduced. The stars were paid $75,000 per episode in season three, $85,000 in season four, $100,000 in season five, $125,000 in season six, $750,000 in seasons seven and eight, and $1million in seasons nine and ten, making Aniston, Cox, and Kudrow the highest paid TV actresses of all-time. The cast also received syndication royalties beginning in 2000 after renegotiations. At the time, that financial benefit {{of a piece of}} the show's lucrative back end profits had only been given out to stars who had ownership rights in a show, like <b>Jerry</b> <b>Seinfeld</b> and Bill Cosby.|$|E
