2500|$|Electrical {{stimulation}} of the scalp can produce an electric current within the brain that activates the motor pathways of the pyramidal tracts. [...] This technique is known as transcranial <b>electrical</b> <b>motor</b> potential (TcMEP) monitoring. [...] This technique effectively evaluates the motor pathways in {{the central nervous system}} during surgeries which place these structures at risk. [...] These motor pathways, including the lateral corticospinal tract, are located in the lateral and ventral funiculi of the spinal cord. [...] Since the ventral and dorsal spinal cord have separate blood supply with very limited collateral flow, an anterior cord syndrome (paralysis or paresis with some preserved sensory function) is a possible surgical sequela, so {{it is important to have}} monitoring specific to the motor tracts as well as dorsal column monitoring.|$|E

The <b>electrical</b> <b>motor</b> assist adds another [...] {{and a maximum}} of 36 pound-feet (49 Nm) of torque when called on, with the aim to boost performance {{to the level of}} a typical 1.5 L petrol engine. It also acts as a generator during deceleration and braking to recharge the vehicle's batteries, and as the Insight's starter motor. (This improves fuel efficiency and extends the lifetime and fade resistance of the brakes, without adding unsprung weight). When the car is not moving, for example at a stop light, the engine shuts off. Power steering is electric, reducing accessory drag.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the noise}} emitted by cheap DC <b>electrical</b> <b>motors</b> is {{investigated}} {{by means of}} a one-to-one comparison psychoacoustic test. This is because, nowadays, DC <b>electrical</b> <b>motors</b> are widely used, and it is useful to understand the main causes of acoustic annoyance. In particular, though different DC <b>electrical</b> <b>motors</b> are fed with a power generator whose voltage is kept constant, their noise emissions are different, indicating various emission spectrums. Since a spectrum is characterized by many harmonics related to the rpm of motors, one of the main problems is finding a method to understand how these harmonics are related to sound quality parameters and, therefore, acoustic annoyance. Two descriptors of sound quality, roughness and pitch height, have been studied. Furthermore, the manner in which roughness and pitch height affect the annoyance is investigated. Results of this study can help manufacturers and users discard motors {{on the basis of their}} noise before being sold or installed...|$|R
