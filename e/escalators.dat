5|$|From the Lexington Avenue entrance, {{there are}} two short <b>escalators</b> and a stair from the {{northwest}} corner, a staircase from the southwest corner, and a short elevator hidden {{around the corner from}} the <b>escalators.</b> From the fare control, {{there are two}} long <b>escalators</b> and a stair to an intermediate level, and then two shorter <b>escalators</b> and a pair of stairs to a lower mezzanine. Here, the bank splits and there are two separate tubes of two <b>escalators</b> and a stair each to each platform. The platform elevator has its own two turnstiles, and makes three stops (mezzanine, upper platform, lower platform).|$|E
5|$|There {{are four}} <b>escalators</b> and two stairs {{from the main}} {{entrance}} to the upper mezzanine. Past the main entrance's fare control, which is split into two banks, there are two parallel shafts down to the lower mezzanine; the northern shaft carries four <b>escalators,</b> while the southern shaft carries one escalator and the two incline elevators. The lowermost five <b>escalators</b> are the system's longest and take about one minute and thirty seconds to traverse.|$|E
5|$|In the 1970s, the <b>escalators</b> at {{the eastern}} end of the station to Adams Street were replaced.|$|E

50|$|The Central-Mid-Levels <b>escalator</b> {{was built}} in 1993; the now vibrant {{character}} of SoHo is attributed {{to the creation of}} the <b>escalator</b> system, which at the time was the longest <b>escalator</b> system in the world. Prior to the <b>escalator</b> construction, the area was populated by many elderly locals, old go-downs and porcelain shops.|$|R
5|$|Like {{many other}} central London Underground stations, Holborn was modernised {{in the early}} 1930s to replace the lifts with <b>escalators.</b> The station frontages on Kingsway and High Holborn were {{partially}} reconstructed to modernist designs by Charles Holden with the granite elements replaced with plain Portland stone fa√ßades perforated with glazed screens. The lifts were removed and a spacious new ticket hall was provided giving access to a bank of four <b>escalators</b> down to an intermediate concourse for the Central line platforms. A second bank of three <b>escalators</b> continues down to the Piccadilly line platforms.|$|E
5|$|Overcrowding was a {{major problem}} at many {{stations}} where interchanges were made with other Underground lines and efforts were made {{in a number of}} places to improve passenger movements. In 1914, work was carried out to provide larger ticket halls and install <b>escalators</b> at Oxford Circus, Embankment and Baker Street. In 1923, further work at Oxford Circus provided a combined Bakerloo and CLR ticket hall and added more <b>escalators</b> serving the CLR platforms. In 1926, Trafalgar Square and Waterloo received <b>escalators,</b> the latter in conjunction with expansion of the station as part of the CCE's extension to Kennington. Between 1925 and 1928, Piccadilly Circus station saw the greatest reconstruction. A large circular ticket hall was excavated below the road junction with multiple subway connections from points around the Circus and two flights of <b>escalators</b> down to the Bakerloo and Piccadilly platforms were installed.|$|E
5|$|The {{extension}} {{opened to}} Jay Street on February 1, 1933, but the High Street station remained closed {{for an additional}} five months. The trains ran through the station without stopping, because the <b>escalators</b> to the street had not been completed {{due to lack of}} funding. That month, the contract for four <b>escalators</b> in the station was awarded to Otis Elevator Company. The station opened on June 24, 1933.|$|E
50|$|Constructed in 1993 and {{completed}} in 1996, the Huangguan <b>Escalator</b> {{was the highest}} single-grading <b>escalator</b> in China and Asia when it was built. Currently, it is the third highest <b>escalator</b> in Asia, after the <b>escalator</b> in Rustaveli station in the Tbilisi Metro (60 meters high) and an <b>escalator</b> in Pyongyang, North Korea. It is 112 m long and 1.3 m wide, with a height of about 53 m, and connects the Chongqing Railway Station at Caiyuanba to Lianglukou Underground Railway station. Due to the hilly nature of the terrain, the underground railway station {{is at the top}} of the <b>escalator</b> while the overground station is at the bottom.|$|R

5|$|The {{station was}} rebuilt {{in the early}} 1990s to {{accommodate}} {{the large number of}} passengers using the station. As a result, the station has an extra-wide southbound platform, the longest <b>escalators</b> on the Underground network and the fourth-longest <b>escalators</b> in Western Europe. It is a candidate station on the proposed Crossrail 2 line from north Surrey and south-west London to south-east Hertfordshire.|$|E

50|$|Built by Pedro Marlote and Juan de la Sierra between 1594 and 1603, {{the great}} <b>escalator</b> is {{characterized}} for its 3 meters wide and its one piece steps. The structure {{was made with}} such a strong granite, {{that the state of}} it is almost perfect after centuries of used. One of the main characteristics that make this <b>escalator</b> unique is the way it was built. The <b>escalator</b> has no central support, resting on the side walls of the building. Under the <b>escalator,</b> in the arcade, there are still rests of the map, the architects draw as a reference to built the <b>escalator.</b>|$|R

50|$|While the {{national}} anthem was playing {{before the start of}} the game, hundreds of children began getting onto an <b>escalator</b> that traveled from the lower deck to the upper deck on the stadium's third base side. Unfortunately, while three or four children at a time were getting on the <b>escalator</b> at the bottom, the top of the <b>escalator</b> was partially blocked by a narrow metal gate that allowed only one person to pass through. The mass of children was thus blocked at the top, and children began falling back on top of one another in a crush of bodies as other children continued to get on at the bottom and as the jagged metal steps of the <b>escalator</b> continued to move beneath all of them. The moving steps cut and mutilated the children until a stadium usher, 65-year-old Melville Gibson, finally reached the <b>escalator's</b> emergency shut-off switch and turned the <b>escalator</b> off. Previously, the shut-off switch had been moved to a wall across from the <b>escalator</b> in order to prevent pranksters from turning it off while people were on it.|$|R
5|$|To {{resolve the}} problem of overcrowding, the station began upgrade works in 2017. This {{includes}} a new northern exit/entrance on the north-west corner of Victoria Street, accessible via a new additional ticket office under Bressenden Place leading to both the Victoria line and the Circle and District line platforms. This upgrade is due to be finished by 2018, and tunnelling for the project was completed in September 2015. The work involved enlarging the existing Victoria line ticket hall serving the railway station and add a new relief bank of <b>escalators</b> there, which opened in January 2017. The redevelopment has been criticised, as access to platforms from the new <b>escalators</b> will be long and indirect compared to the direct access using the existing <b>escalators.</b>|$|E
5|$|Either {{entrance}} can be {{the front}} entrance for this symmetric building under the elevated railway. The lobby {{on the ground floor}} greets visitors entering or exiting the building. Entering the ticketing gate, travelers can take the <b>escalators</b> or stairs to the waiting areas on the second floor. Two waiting areas for passengers that lead to the northbound and southbound trains are connected by an air bridge. Two <b>escalators</b> and one stairway take passengers to the platforms. There are ten emergency exits around the platforms.|$|E
5|$|Every {{station is}} {{equipped}} with General Ticketing Machines (GTMs), a Passenger Service Centre and LED or plasma displays that show train service information and announcements. All stations are equipped with restrooms and payphones; some restrooms are located at street level. Some stations, especially the major ones, have additional amenities and services, such as retail shops and kiosks, supermarkets, convenience stores, automatic teller machines, and self-service automated kiosks {{for a variety of}} services. Heavy-duty <b>escalators</b> at stations carry passengers up or down at a rate of 0.75m/s, 50% faster than conventional <b>escalators.</b>|$|E
50|$|A {{shopping}} cart conveyor is a device used in multi-level retail stores for moving {{shopping cart}}s parallel and adjacent to an <b>escalator.</b> Shoppers can load their shopping carts onto the conveyor, step onto the <b>escalator,</b> ride the <b>escalator</b> with the cart beside them and collect the cart with the contained merchandise {{at the next}} level.|$|R
50|$|The broken <b>escalator</b> phenomenon, {{also known}} as the Walker effect, is the {{sensation}} of losing balance or dizziness reported by some people when stepping onto an <b>escalator</b> which is not working. It is said that there is a brief, odd sensation of imbalance, despite full awareness that the <b>escalator</b> is not going to move.|$|R
2500|$|An <b>escalator</b> is {{a moving}} staircase, a {{conveyor}} transport device for carrying people between floors of a building. Commonly found {{and used in}} shopping malls, department stores, airports, an <b>escalator</b> consists of a motor-driven chain of individual, linked steps that move up or down on tracks, allowing the step treads to remain horizontal. The <b>escalator</b> was invented in 1859 by Nathan Ames of Saugus, Massachusetts for an invention that he called [...] "Revolving Stairs". However, Ames' <b>escalator</b> was never built. The earliest form of a working <b>escalator,</b> patented in 1892 by Jesse W. Reno, was introduced as a new novelty ride at the Old Iron Pier at Coney Island, New York in 1896.|$|R
5|$|Following the takeover, the UERL {{took steps}} to {{integrate}} the CLR's operations with its own. The CLR's power station was closed in March 1928 with power instead being supplied from the UERL's Lots Road Power Station in Chelsea. Busier stations were modernised; Bank and Shepherd's Bush stations received <b>escalators</b> in 1924, Tottenham Court Road and Oxford Circus in 1925 and Bond Street in 1926, which also received a new entrance designed by Charles Holden. Chancery Lane and Marble Arch stations were also rebuilt to receive <b>escalators</b> in the early 1930s.|$|E
5|$|In May 2017, {{all three}} <b>escalators</b> in Entrance 1 were damaged by {{sprinklers}} activated by faulty sensors, causing the entire entrance to be shuttered indefinitely.|$|E
5|$|In October 1911, the Piccadilly tube {{platforms}} at Earl's Court station {{became the}} first on the Underground network to be served by <b>escalators</b> when {{a link between the}} District and Piccadilly platforms was created.|$|E
50|$|When {{it first}} opened in 1992, the Zeilgalerie only had 1 <b>escalator</b> which went in an upwards direction. A few years later, a {{downwards}} travelling <b>escalator</b> was installed.|$|R
5000|$|The {{gate at the}} top of the <b>escalator</b> ‚Äî {{called a}} [...] "people channeler" [...] ‚Äî had {{apparently}} been left there after a previous event, when the <b>escalator's</b> direction had been switched to move people downward. The gate's purpose was to control the flow of people getting onto the <b>escalator.</b> Shortly before the tragedy, Orioles management had decided to open the stadium's upper deck to Safety Patrol members who were still arriving by game time, after early-arriving children had filled the bleachers. Children heading for the upper deck then got onto the <b>escalator.</b>|$|R
50|$|Alperton {{formerly}} {{shared with}} Greenford (on the Central line) {{the distinction of}} being one of the only two stations to have an <b>escalator</b> going up to the platforms. The <b>escalator</b> served the eastbound platform and had originally been used at the South Bank exhibition of the Festival of Britain. Now out of use, the <b>escalator</b> remains in place behind a wall.|$|R
5|$|In {{conjunction}} with {{the reconstruction of the}} main line station above, a new ticket hall was excavated below the concourse with two sets of <b>escalators</b> replacing the lifts. The <b>escalators</b> provide access to and from an intermediate passenger circulation level, which, in turn, gives access to the Northern line Charing Cross branch platforms and two further sets of escalators; one set each serving the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern line Bank branch platforms. Interchanges between the northbound and southbound Victoria and Northern Bank Line platforms are made via a passageway at the lower level so as to avoid the need to use the <b>escalators.</b> An emergency stair to the intermediate interchange level is located midway along the passageway. The Victoria line platforms opened on 1 December 1968 when the second section of the line was opened between Highbury & Islington and Warren Street. Disused passages remain with tiling and posters from the 1960s.|$|E
5|$|In {{the early}} 1970s the lifts to the Piccadilly line {{platforms}} {{were replaced by}} <b>escalators,</b> with one pair being provided between the ticket hall and a new intermediate level, where it met a linking passageway to the Circle and District line platforms, and three being provided from there to a lower concourse between the levels of the two Piccadilly line platforms. Stairs up and down from the lower concourse connect to the platforms. The stairs and passage to the westbound platform {{are located in the}} disused DR westbound platform tunnel. With the introduction of <b>escalators,</b> the GNP station building was taken out of use.|$|E
5|$|Later, {{they play}} their {{favorite}} game, Eels and <b>Escalators.</b> Patrick always gets <b>escalators</b> but SpongeBob always gets eels. Eventually, he loses {{the game and}} accidentally utters the swear word. Patrick then races to the Krusty Krab to tell Mr. Krabs with SpongeBob trying to stop him, inadvertently getting Patrick to say the word in the process. When SpongeBob bursts {{through the front door}} and tells Mr. Krabs that Patrick said the swear word, Patrick then joins along. Eventually, Mr. Krabs stops their gibberish explanations, and takes SpongeBob and Patrick outside and makes them paint the Krusty Krab as punishment.|$|E
50|$|Cunningham's Camp <b>Escalator</b> was {{a moving}} seated <b>escalator</b> open c. 1919 to 1968 from a short {{distance}} behind the promenade in Douglas, Isle of Man, to Cunningham‚Äôs holiday camp on Victoria Road.|$|R
50|$|Angel tube {{station on}} Islington High Street has the longest <b>escalator</b> on the London Underground system, at 318 steps. In 2006 a Norwegian man made {{headlines}} after skiing down the <b>escalator</b> at the station.|$|R
