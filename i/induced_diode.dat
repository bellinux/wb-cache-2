40|$|The {{predictable}} quantum efficient detector (PQED) is a cheaper, {{more practical}} {{alternative to the}} current radiometric primary standard, the cryogenic radiometer. The PQED is made of an <b>induced</b> <b>diode,</b> a rectifying junction based on a positively charged dielectric film which induces an n-type inversion layer on a p-type silicon substrate. Increasing the fixed charge Qf in the dielectric has been theoretically predicted to improve the quantum efficiency of the diode by decreasing the surface recombination velocity (SRV) at the dielectric-silicon interface, as well as improving {{the performance of the}} diode at high intensities. In this work, we purpose the replacement of silicon oxide (SiOx) with silicon nitride (SiNx) as the inversion-inducing dielectric layer as a means of increasing Qf. Amorphous PECVD SiNx has been shown to have a significantly higher Qf than thermally grown SiOx. A sixfold increase of Qf in SiNx by means of charge injection via bias soaking has also been demonstrated. The dielectric ideality of the nitride increases with the atomic nitrogen concentration x, and a high-x film has shown superior charge retention properties. The absorption in the high-x film is far less than 1 % in the applicable wavelength ranges, but is larger in the low-x film. The impact of Qf on the SRV has been experimentally demonstrated, and may be fit to the extended SRH theory with the inclusion of a sub-surface damage term. Finally, it has been demonstrated that the aluminium contacts deposited for the purpose of charging the SiNx may be chemically removed while the injected charge remains. SiNx has thus been shown to be an interesting candidate for the PQED application. </p...|$|E

40|$|This paper investigates both {{theoretically}} and experimentally {{the charge}} collection efficiency (CCE) degradation in silicon <b>diodes</b> <b>induced</b> by energetic ions. Ion Beam Induced Charge (IBIC) measurements {{carried out on}} n- and p-type silicon diodes which were previously irradiated with MeV He ions show evidence that the CCE degradation does not only depend on the mass, energy and fluence of the damaging ion, but also depends on the ion probe species and on the polarization state of the device. A general one-dimensional model is derived, which accounts for the ion-induced defect distribution, the ionization profile of the probing ion and the charge induction mechanism. Using the ionizing and non-ionizing energy loss profiles resulting from simulations based on the binary collision approximation and on the electrostatic/transport parameters of the diode under study as input, the model is able to accurately reproduce the experimental CCE degradation curves without introducing any phenomenological additional term or formula. Although limited to low level of damage, the model is quite general, including the displacement damage approach as a special case and {{can be applied to}} any semiconductor device.

This study aimed to establish if physical damage <b>induced</b> by the <b>diode</b> laser could affect the histopathological diagnosis and to evaluate the damage caused to the resection margins. Between 2005 and 2010, at S. Gerardo Hospital, Milan, 608 cases of soft tissue lesions localized in the oral cavity (cheek, gingiva, buccal mucosa, tongue, and lips) were examined. Specimens were excised with an 808 -nm diode laser, output 1. 6 - 2. 7 W, in continuous-wave mode with fibers of 320 μm. Specimens were fixed in 10 % buffered formalin solution and examined separately under an optical microscope by two pathologists. In all of the specimens, changes to the epithelium, connective tissue and blood vessels, shape of incision damage, and overall width of modified tissues were evaluated. The data for specimens larger than 3 mm excised with the diode laser were not significant in terms of stromal changes or vascular stasis, while epithelial and stromal changes were significantly more frequent in specimens with a mean size below 3 mm; the diagnosis was not achievable in 46. 15 %.

40|$|The {{demand for}} {{efficient}} and cheap point-of-care diagnostic devices {{and the increasing}} opportunities stemming from the recent advances in nanofabrication trigger the interest {{in the development of}} a new generation of biosensors. In this thesis, a novel nanoplasmonic biosensor with integrated readout is presented. The key factor for using nanoplasmonics for biosensing is the high sensitivity of the plasmonic resonance to variations in the refractive index at the interface between the structure and the surrounding medium. This enables label-free detection of biomolecular binding events in real-time, which have recently been utilized in several biosensor applications. In contrast to conventional surface plasmon resonance sensors based on flat metal films, nanoplasmonic sensors can be used in transmission mode and do not require prism coupling. Although this is one of the main advantages of nanoplasmonics compared with conventional plasmonics, the technique still requires external detectors. This increases the complexity and the costs of the device, confining its diffusion to a narrow range of users. In this thesis, nanoplasmon-active structures have been fabricated on a light sensitive p/n junction. The photovoltaic current <b>induced</b> in such <b>diodes</b> is directly proportional to the absorbed light intensity which, at a specific wavelength, depends upon the resonance position of the nanoplasmonic structure. Hence, changes in the plasmonic resonance, as induced by biomolecular binding events, can be directly transformed into shifts in the photovoltaic current; thus allowing for a fast, reliable and easily accessible measurement technique. The results on biosensing using this concept will be presented and discussed regarding the applicability of the sensor for rapid, simple and cost-effective medical diagnostics. The challenges and the optimization of the fabrication process will be discussed...|$|R

These spectra {{have been used to}} analyze the interactive functions of cadmium (Cd 2 +) and zinc (Zn 2 +) on photosynthetic activities of S. lycopersicum plants. The fluorescence intensity ratios (F 690 /F 735) of the chlorophyll bands at 685 and 730 nm were calculated by evaluating curve fitted parameters using a Gaussian spectral function, for control as well as treated plants. The fluorescence induction kinetics (Kautsky effect) was also measured on dark adapted intact plant leaves at the chlorophyll bands for determining the variable chlorophyll fluorescence decrease ratio (R Fd values) and the stress adaptation index (Ap). In addition, metal accumulation in plants, plant growth and photosynthetic pigments content were estimated. It was found that the R Fd(690), R Fd(730) and Ap values decreased whereas the F 690 /F 735 ratio increased in the case of 10 μM Cd 2 + treated plants, indicating an impairment of the photosynthetic efficiency. Zn 2 + supplementation, at low concentration (10 and 50 μM), in combination with Cd 2 + protect the photochemical functions. However, the high Zn 2 + concentration exacerbated the negative effects of Cd 2 + and showed a severe decrease of R Fd(690), R Fd(730) and Ap values compared to Cd 2 + alone. It is seen that F 690 /F 735 ratios are strongly correlated with chlorophyll contents. The results demonstrate the usefulness of F 690 /F 735, Ap and R Fd values in determining the potential photosynthetic activity of an intact attached leaf in a non-destructive way. © 2012 Elsevier B.

Within a short time interval (˜ 580 ms) multiple images (typically 20) are captured using the LEDs in the pulsed mode. For each pixel of the fluorescence image Fv/Fm and tTR are calculated and presented as images that correlate with the quantum yield of PSII photochemistry and the time response of this process, respectively. The advantage of the technology lies in the imaging of photosynthetic parameters {{within a short time}} interval, remotely and under light conditions. This was accomplished by the development of a high intensity pulsed LED light source (total 5 kW electrical power) and using the LEDs in the pulsed mode with a pulse width of 15 ms and time between sequential pulses of 14 ms. Using this instrumentation we investigated the effect of herbicide treatment, Sencor, on black nightshade (Solanum nigrum L.) plants. Effects of the herbicide on the first fluorescence images could be detected. At the saturation level of the fluorescence this effect disappeared. The effect of the herbicide was visualized on the Fv/Fm image and the time response tTR image. Healthy and herbicide treated parts of the plant yielded average values of Fv/Fm= 0. 81 ± 0. 03 and 0. 06 ± 0. 02, respectively. Furthermore, the effect of drought stress was investigated on saintpaulia (Saintpaulia ionantha) plants.

For the other two spectral ranges that covered 1, 550 to 5, 500  nm, a liquid nitrogen-cooled InSb was used for photo-detection. For the 3, 000 - to 5, 500 -nm range, a long pass filter that blocked wavelengths less than 2, 500  nm was in place to eliminate the short wavelength features from appearing in higher order. Also, for spectral acquisition at wavelengths greater than 2, 500  nm, the monochrometer was purged with dry nitrogen gas in order to reduce a strong absorption feature at 4, 300  nm resulting from atmospheric CO 2. Emission was measured with the Tm 3 +:YCl 3 remaining sealed in the fused silica ampoules to prevent degradation from exposure to atmospheric moisture. Fused silica is transparent for the range of emission wavelengths studied. For Tm 3 +:KPb 2 Cl 5, no environmental precautions were used. In each case, the wavelength dependence of the complete light collection and detection system was calibrated using a blackbody source. Spectra were corrected using the system response function obtained from the blackbody calibration. To observe fluorescent decays, the laser diodes were operated in pulsed mode to pump the 3 H 4 level of Tm 3 +, and a digitizing oscilloscope recorded the transient response from the photo-detectors. During fluorescent decay measurements, the monochrometer acted as a filter to isolate emission at wavelengths associated with specific energy levels.|$|R
40|$|Wind {{power is}} an {{established}} mean of clean energy {{production and the}} modern {{horizontal axis wind turbine}} has become a common sight. The need for maintenance is high and future wind turbines may need to be improved to enable more remote and offshore locations. Vertical axis wind turbines have possible benefits, such as higher reliability, less noise and lower centre of gravity. This thesis focuses on electromechanical interaction in the straight bladed Darrieus rotor (H-rotor) concept studied at Uppsala University. One of the challenges with vertical axis technology is the oscillating aerodynamic forces. A force measurement setup has been implemented to capture the forces on a three-bladed 12 kW open site prototype. The normal force showed good agreement with simulations. An aerodynamic torque could be estimated from the system. The total electrical torque in the generator was determined from electrical measurements. Both torque estimations lacked the expected aerodynamic ripple at three times per revolution. The even torque detected is an important result and more studies are required to confirm and understand it. The force measurement was also used to study the loads on the turbine in parked conditions. It was discovered that there is a strong dependence on wind direction {{and that there is a}} positive torque on the turbine at stand still. The results can assist to determine the best parking strategies for an H-rotor turbine. The studied concept also features diode rectification of the voltage from the permanent magnet synchronous generator. Diodes are considered a cheap and robust solution for rectification at the drawback of inducing ripple in the torque and output voltage. The propagation of the torque ripple was measured on the prototype and studied with simulations and analytical expressions. One key conclusion was that the mechanical driveline of the turbine is an effective filter of the <b>diode</b> <b>induced</b> torque ripple. A critical speed controller was implemented on the prototype. The controller was based on optimal torque control and according to the experiments and the simulations it was able to avoid a rotational speed span. Finally, the optimal torque control was evaluated for multiple turbines with diode rectification to a common DC-link. The setup can potentially reduce the overall complexity of wind farms. The simulations suggest that stability of the system can be obtained by controlling the DC-link load as a semi constant voltage. The thesis is based on nine papers of which six are treated in the thesis summary. ...|$|R
40|$|Amphetamine type stimulants (ATS) are a {{class of}} psycho-stimulant drugs and are the second most {{prevalent}} illicit drug type worldwide. ATS are chiral compounds, with the dextro-enantiomer being more potent than the levo-enantiomer. As both enantiomers exhibit different pharmacological activity, being able to discriminate between the enantiomers demonstrates the importance of chiral separations. Production of these drugs is heavily reliant {{on the availability of}} precursor chemicals, and the production route used ultimately determines whether a racemic mixture or the more potent dextro-enantiomer is formed. Although gas chromatography and liquid chromatography are established methods for drug analysis, capillary electrophoresis has emerged as a powerful technique for chiral analyses. There is a noticeable push towards portable lab-on-chip (LOC) devices for increasing the prospect of faster field analyses, in comparison to the slower laboratory based techniques. The aim of the project was to develop an optimised chiral separation method for amphetamine (AMP), methamphetamine (MAMP) and 3, 4 -methylenedioxymethamphetamine (MDMA) using capillary electrophoresis (CE) with cyclodextrin (CD) based chiral selectors. Following the exploration of a fluorescent derivatising reagent, the optimised method would be investigated using the portable Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 lab-on-chip system, with light emitting <b>diode</b> <b>induced</b> fluorescence (LED-IF) detection. The CE optimised parameters for the chiral separation method were: 20 mM hydroxypropyl-β-CD (HP-β-CD) for AMP/MAMP and 10 mM HP-β-CD for MDMA in 150 mM phosphate buffer at pH 3 with an applied voltage of 25 kV and a fused silica capillary (56. 5 cm effective length, 50 μm ID). A temperature of either 15 OC (for AMP and MAMP) or 30 OC (for MDMA) was used. The chiral separation was also successful in negative polarity mode, which effectively shortens the capillary length to 8. 5 cm (similar to the 1. 5 cm separation length used in Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 analysis). Fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) was used for the fluorescent labelling reagent for the derivatisation of racemic AMP, MAMP and MDMA. A 50 μL of 10 mM FITC in acetone was combined with 50 μL of the racemic drugs standards and 50 μL of 10 mM borate buffer, pH 9. Samples were then derivatised at 90 OC for a 10 minute accelerated derivatisation. The final stage was combining the FITC treated drugs with the optimised chiral separation method. Fluorescence analysis confirmed the derivatisation of the drugs in high pH; however, fluorescence or chiral separation did not occur on the CE using the optimised HP-β-CD in low pH buffer. Future work would include examining a different CD which favours chiral separation in a higher pH to allow for FITC or another fluorescent derivatising reagent to complex. Analysis of ATS with LOC Agilent Bioanalyzer 2100 would thus occur if the method could be optimised for LED-IF of chiral derivatised drugs...|$|R
40|$|This study {{describes}} various {{strategies to}} improve the sensitivity of carbohydrate analysis in capillary electrophoresis (CE). The use of pH stacking is investigated in conjunction with 5 -aminofluorescein as a derivatisation agent for the sensitive analysis of simple sugars such as glucose, lactose and maltotriose by CE. The derivatisation agent was {{selected on the basis}} of its extremely high molar absorptivity, its compatibility with a 488 nm light-emitting diode (LED) and the fact that it has two ionisable groups making it compatible with on-line stacking using a dynamic pH junction. The influence of both acetic and formic acids were investigated with regard to both derivatisation efficiency and the ability to stack using a dynamic pH junction. Superior sensitivity and resolution was obtained in formic acid over acetic acid. Simulation studies combined with experimental data showed the separation with the best resolution and greatest sensitivity when the carbohydrates were derivatised with the 95 mM formic acid. Using this method efficiencies of 150, 000 plates and detection limits at 8. 5 x 10 ⁻⁸ M for mono-, di- and tri-saccharides were achieved. The current system demonstrates a 515 times improvement factoring sensitivity when compared to using a normal deuterium (D₂) lamp, and 16 times improvement over other systems using lightemitting diodes (LEDs). A novel fluorescent tag, 0 - 2 -[aminoethyl]fluorescein, was developed for the separation of sugars by CE with laser-induced fluorescence (LIF) detection using an argon ion laser. The tag was synthesised using three consecutive steps namely: esterification, alkylation and hydrolysis, specifically designed to offer a flexible way in which to make an assortment of fluorescent tags from cheap and readily available starting reagents (typically less than 1 per g of fluorescent tag). 0 - 2 -[Aminoethyl]fluorescein was equipped with a spacer group to lower steric effects between the fluorescein backbone and the reducing end of the carbohydrate which were anticipated {{to improve the}} reactivity of the tag. Fluorescence studies of the novel tag revealed a quantum yield (QY) of 0. 24, when using fluorescein as a standard. Kinetic studies were also conducted to compare and assess the performance of aromatic and aliphatic amines using the novel tag and two commercial fluorescent fluorescein motifs where the aromatic amine derivative demonstrated better labelling performance. The separation performance of all the tags was also benchmarked using a range of corn syrup oligosaccharides. The application of the novel tag to a set of oligosaccharides produced a baseline separation of seven different sugar units, with 1 nM detection limit for maltoheptaose. A CE method was designed with on-line concentration which can be translated directly to a microchip format allowing preconcentration via dynamic pH junction. Optimisation of the separation selectivity yielded best separations using a 170 mM ammonium borate buffer at pH 8. 60 in an acrylamide coated capillary. When using the current system via LIP, limits of detection (LODs) as low as 0. 13 nM for maltose were obtained, which were 10 times lower than could be achieved without on-line concentration. In order to implement this system in a glass/polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) microchip, the low pH sample was introduced into the microchannels via a cathodic pH independent electro-osmotic flow (EOF) generated using a polyelectrolyte multilayer coating. Microchip separations of maltose, glucose, galactose and allose with dynamic pH junction, were achieved within 120 s, with the limit of detection (LOD) of maltose using a light-emitting <b>diode</b> <b>induced</b> fluorescence (LEDIF) detection system being 790 nM. This is the first implementation of on-line concentration via a dynamic pH junction in a microchip, and significantly, the improvement in sensitivity achieved when translated to the microchip was equivalent to that achieved in capillaries...|$|R
