40|$|In {{the current}} wake of growing {{technology}} and modernization {{the biggest challenge}} remains the optimization of our time, particularly for the business executives. For the executives the vital information at their fingertips plays an important role. In the computer era, there are many financial institutions like wise banks which provide web-based application to access all their functionalities associated with particular task. An Enterprise Bank Agent (EBA) was developed, which resolves such problems being faced by user, it provides one window for {{that enables them to}} experience and enjoy the flavors of banking functionality. The key feature of this application was its ability to handle all registered Customers business requirements. In order to handle all customer services, <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a smart answering machine...|$|E
40|$|The {{graphical}} {{user interface}} for a software system has several important roles to fulfill. It shall serve the end users in their interactions with the system and <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a front for the system. It is an advantage if the {{graphical user interface}} gives the receiver confidence and inspiration to use the system. Consistency and usability in graphical and technical design are important qualities and aspects that influence the receiver’s opinion of a graphical user interface and additionally the whole system. Moreover {{when there is a}} suite of proprietary systems from one supplier, the different application user interfaces shall provide for a homogeneous and familiar impression. The graphical user interface gives furthermore a possibility to confirm brand recognition for the software producer. It is a great challenge for a large-scale enterprise to develop and deliver comprehensive software systems with a common expression and consistency in the different graphical user interfaces. In order for large-scale enterprises to succeed in such activities, it is necessary to coordinate and integrate the development of user interfaces. The focus of this thesis is, consequently, to investigate how technological support for graphical user interface development in large-scale enterprises can contribute to this and support user interface designers and developers in a large-scale enterprise when the product portfolio is widespread. The contributions of the thesis work are presented as a number of observations and the observations as such are summarized in a case study. Moreover, the thesis proposes a technological concept for a large-scale software enterprise, where the aim is to support a common and coordinated way of working with enterprise development of graphical user interfaces...|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} of this thesis is to develop finite element modelling approach for the bonded flooring structure. <b>It</b> <b>shall</b> <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a base for developing design models to {{study the effects of}} different structural profiles, materials, and to perform design optimisation. Improvements in the structural design of semi-trailers are needed to cope-up with strict emission regulations, reducing fuel cost and improving payload capacity. In this study, a finite element modelling approach was developed for bonded flooring structures. Scaled-down models representing different zones of semi-trailer were modelled and simulated for ISO 1496 - 1 (1990) floor strength and stiffness test. The simulations were validated through experiments performed at the facility of UPM Plywood Oy in Lahti, Finland. Based on the comparative study of finite element simulations and experiment results, critical parameters in the finite element models were investigated. The data acquired from the scaled-down models was used to comprehend the effect of different ply lay-up on the model displacement. Scaled-down models including common structural profiles used in semi-trailers were used to develop a comparative study to comprehend the effect of geometrical profiles on lightweight construction. The scaled-down models were generated with three different spans i. e. 300 mm, 400 mm, and 500 mm. As a result, it was concluded that the I-Profile was a suitable choice for small and medium span whereas Z-Profile was an optimum choice at long span i. e. 500 mm. Scaled-down models with I-profile as a cross member was simulated to understand the application of lightweight materials in design process. FE modelling approach developed for scaled-down models was applied to the partial (full-width) and full-scale models. These models were then simulated for ISO 1496 - 1 (1990) floor strength/stiffness and freight load case respectively. Weight reduction of about 5. 28 % was achieved in the cross members using partial models. Longitudinal beams contributed to more weight reduction. In the ISO 1496 - 1 (1990) forklift wheel-load case, it was concluded that the preliminary redesign of the flooring structure provides weight reduction of 3. 82 %. And, it increase in the model stiffness by 2. 88 % in partial models. Full-scale semi-trailer model with plywood yielded 9. 47 % less deformations in comparison to chassis-only model for freight load case. Therefore, it was concluded to use plywood panels in the finite element simulations for improved optimisation. The outcome of this thesis would be beneficial for semi-trailer designers in early design process. And, it shall also improve overall design process of the bonded floor semi-trailers...|$|E

40|$|What is {{the effect}} of a city {{ordinance}} which proposes to a public utility company the terms on which it may dispose of its product to the users, but which is rejected by the company? As to a company not yet doing business {{it is clear that the}} ordinance when rejected becomes a mere legal nullity. It never was more than an offer that might ripen into a binding contract by acceptance. That it is by no means a nullity as to a utility actually operating in the city after the expiration of its franchise and as a mere tenant by sufferance of the streets, is held in City and County of Denver v. Denver Union Water Co. Supreme Court of the U. S. Nos. 294 and 295, decided March 4, 1918. The city of Denver may well be surprised to learn that by passing an ordinance which the company rejected it was considerably worse off than if it had done nothing. In effect, by passing an ordinance fixing the maximum charges permitted to be made by the company 2 ̆ 2 during the time <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> further <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a water carrier and tenant by sufferance of said streets 2 ̆ 2, the city gave to the plant a value that made the rates illegal and defeated the ordinance. That any unaccepted ordinance should have such an effect is indeed startling, the more so that in this case the city was careful to expressly recite in the preamble that the company had for four years been without a franchise and a mere tenant by sufferance of the streets and that this enactment was made without recognizing the right of the company to occupy the streets or to continue its service...|$|R
40|$|Le patronat ne peut rester indifférent devant {{le fait de}} la fusion CMTC-CCT. Aussi cet article a-t-il pour but de faire connaître d'une façon succinte une réaction patronale sur le sujet. L'auteur considère que la {{nouvelle}} centrale devra tenir compte de deux principes fondamentaux: le respect de la liberté et le respect de la loi. Il expose les critères à l'aide desquels pourra être vérifiée la fidélité à ces principes. Employers avoid {{to interfere}} in a field which is not theirs, but they cannot ignore such an important fact as the Merger of Labor unions. Because {{they will have to}} deal with the new Union, they wonder about its orientation and its effect in their enterprises; but, they are confident that after the examples of European experiences and with the application of those two important principles: respect of freedom and respect of the law, the CLC will be useful to all. This freedom means the possibility for every human being to associate with other men in order to pursue honest objectives within the laws. So, the new Central will have to respect this fundamental freedom of the worker which makes him free to join or not join it; and once a member, he may express his own opinion which can influence the whole supra-structure. Some unions are organized on trade basis and other on industrial basis: the CLC will have to let every worker free to make his choice and experiment, if he wishes so, new formulas. Furthermore and primarly, the worker should be respected as a human being. It is not indifferent, but of first importance, that union members respect the Christian thought and be free to express themselves. Fortunately, Canadian unionism has never been revolutionary. To realize its main objective: unity of the movement, the CLC shall try to gain as many members as possible, but to do so, <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> never <b>act</b> <b>as</b> a monopoly. The CLC, having by the merger, enormous funds at its disposal will have a good chance to organize the unorganized, to insist with all its weight on union bargaining, to exert a political influence and to gather all the money for which <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> be honestly accounted for. In every way, <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> always respect the law and it is appreciable that, with the merger, there will be no more raidings, and jurisdictional disputes. With the growing strength of the union movement and the mergers in the United States and Canada, will the Minister of Labour in either one or the other country still be necessary, as they were created to protect the workers? Fortunately, the CLC has categorically declared that <b>it</b> <b>shall</b> not consent to direct political action, which can easily be a cause of division or scission among the labor class as anywhere. Canadian employers are very happy to realize that, in North America, Labor unions got rid of communist infiltration and they are confident in the honesty of the CLC and of its leaders. They also approve its autonomy and independance from the AFL-CIO...|$|R
