[...] The Congresswoman posed {{questions}} to the witnesses, including Oscar Munoz,, after the Committee Chairman Bill Shuster left his chair. Napolitano's questions were critical of the airlines' plans to impose self-regulation in response to recent customer service controversies. As the founder and Chair of the Congressional Mental Health Caucus, Napolitano further asked whether the Airlines provide mental health services to their employees because of the stressful nature of flight attendant jobs and the increasing demands that airline companies put on flight attendants. Mr. William J. McGee, the country’s foremost expert and advocate on consumer rights as the Aviation Consultant for Consumers Union responded that this was “an <b>excellent</b> <b>question</b> because… {{right now we have}} a situation where employees are under tremendous strain because of the executive decisions that are putting flight attendants in the front lines of many of these situations. Flight attendants have a primary responsibility to ensure safety, evacuation, and of course customer service, but we have asked them to be bouncers, and police officers, and all kinds of other things, so {{there is no question that}} there is an issue of training as well.” ...|$|E

One notably ironic Analects passage accuses the Master himself of having lost it.Chieh Yu, the madman of Ch'u, passed by Confucius, singing: [...] "Phoenix! Phoenix! How your virtue has declined! Your past cannot be corrected, But your future {{is yet to}} come. Give up! Give up! Those who involve {{themselves}} in Government now Will be in danger." [...] Confucius jumped down, wanting to talk to him, but he ran away, so Confucius couldn't talk to him.

[...] (15:3) Confucius said: [...] "Even {{over a long period of}} time, there have been few people who have actualized the Mean into Manifest Virtue." [...] (6:27) Confucius said: [...] "I have never seen one who loves virtue as much as he loves sex." [...] (9:17, repeated in 14:12) Confucius said: [...] "The virtuous will certainly have something to say, but those who have something to say are not necessarily virtuous. The humane man is always brave, but the brave man is not necessarily possessed of humaneness." [...] (14.5) Confucius said: [...] "Clever words disrupt virtue. Lack of patience in small matters leads to the disruption of great plans." [...] (15:26) Confucius said: [...] "The 'conventional townsman' is a thief of virtue." [...] (17:13, cf. Mencius 7B:37) Confucius said: [...] "To apprehend the Tao and lecture on it before actualization is to throw away your accumulation of virtue." [...] (17:14) This last quote implies that de can be accumulated, and Confucius was not completely pessimistic about virtue going astray. For example (14:6), he praised his disciple Nangong Kuo as [...] "a Superior Man, a man of enhanced virtue." [...] These four contexts describe de as a measurable force that one can [...] "return," [...] "cultivate," [...] "extend," [...] and [...] "heighten".Tseng Tzu said: [...] "When they are careful (about their parents) to the end and continue in reverence after (their parents) are long gone, the virtue of the people will return to its natural depth."

40|$|Hypotheses {{are formed}} {{in many areas}} of science. In drug development, {{hypotheses}} are tested by using a research question, a research hypothesis (sometimes called an alternative hypothesis), and a null hypothesis. These three items are stated in the study protocol before the trial starts. We then conduct the trial, collect data, and use biostatistics to analyze the data. The result of this analysis leads to one of two mutually exclusive choices: we either reject the null hypothesis in favor of the research hypothesis, or we fail to reject the null hypothesis. You may have noticed our attention to the null hypothesis. Since we are essentially trying to “prove ” that the drug is effective, why do we use a process that focuses on disproving that the drug is not effective? In other words, why do we focus on the null hypothesis, and either reject it or fail to reject it? These are <b>excellent</b> <b>questions,</b> since this process of hypothesis testing often seems paradoxical at first.

The goal of this phenomenological study was to determine what within the lived experiences of exemplary oncology nurses facilitates the avoidance of compassion fatigue. A purposive sample of 7 oncology nurses (RNs) who were identified by their colleagues as exemplary caregivers was recruited. Data were collected through semi-structured conversations which were subsequently transcribed. Transcripts were analyzed for reoccurring themes using three points of reference; recurrence of ideas, repetition of ideas, and forcefulness with which ideas were expressed (Owen, 1984).

The agreement on this question is not consensual between the economists. Technological innovation is one of the determinative ones of the exportations of the firms in Brazil? This article search evidences that can help to answer this question. The article measure the impact on the Brazilian exportations of an average increase in one variable that affects the propensity to the technological innovation of the firm, the schooling of workers used in the companies, and of an average increase in the scale efficiency. The empirical results of this article have information for firms and suggest that the companies who carry through technological innovation have 16 % more possibilities to be exporting of that the firms that do not make innovations. The increase of 20 % in the efficiency of scale of the average of the firms in the Brazilian industry, would increase in 4, 2 % the probability of the firm to be an exporter. Simulations taking as base the results of the model suggest that 81. 6 % of the increase of the resultant exportations of positive variations in the efficiency of scale and the propensity to carry through technological innovation of the firm would be resultant of the exportations of the firms that they do not export and that they would start to export. This seems to indicate that the increasing of the number of exporting Brazilian firms depends on especially excellent form of internal variable of the firm and that affect its competitiveness in the external market, as efficiency of scale and propensity to the technological innovation. ...|$|E
40|$|More then ever, we are {{awash in}} {{information}}. With {{the advent of}} the internet, search engines and now more than two billion people wired users globally, information “has become the modern era’s defining quality, the blood, the fuel, the vital principle of our world”, writes author James Gleick: The problem, of course, is that the quality of information varies widely. Much of it is utterly useless, woefully incomplete or worse, wilfully misleading. As a citizen and reporter watching those in power for more than 30 years, I am accustomed to being lied to. But it seems to have got noticeably worse in recent years. In the United States, consider how Democratic and Republican presidents have repeatedly delayed and distorted the political truth. In 1964, president Lyndon Johnson was secretly girding for a major war in Vietnam while publicly promising not to send more soldiers. In 1972, president Richard Nixon secretly authorised a political “dirty tricks” operation inside the White House that, among many other things, effectively derailed the campaign of his most formidable Democratic foe, Senator Edmund Muskie. Both incumbent presidents breezed to their election victories in those years. In the case of the Vietnam War (1962 - 1975), in which hundreds of thousands of lives were lost, the public learned {{over a period of years}} – with astonishing revelations still trickling out four decades later – that the rationale for direct US involvement there actually was a monstrous lie. Instead of being attacked in a remote part of the world known as the “Gulf of Tonkin” by the North Vietnamese, as Johnson had announced, the United States government had in fact been engaged for months in various top secret intelligence gathering activities in flagrant violation of North Vietnam’s sovereign land, air space and territorial waters, including aggressive military provocations against that country. Many of these and other lies and distortions were officially documented in the Pentagon Papers – the Department of Defense’s secret, voluminous history of the Vietnam War – which were leaked to reporters and courageously published by The New York Times, The Washington Post and other newspapers in June 1971. The publishing of the Pentagon Papers and the media’s coverage of the Nixon Watergate scandal still represent a high-water mark in the struggle between raw political power and democratic values. But even with those emblematic moments, important information about those in power took years to become known to the public. As the then-executive editor of The Washington Post, Benjamin Bradlee, mused two decades later: “what might have happened had the truth emerged in 1963 instead of 1971 ?” At a public lecture at Harvard University in 1991, Bradlee said: It seems to me that lying has reached such epidemic proportions in our culture and among our institutions in recent years that we’ve all become immunised to it. What the hell ever happened to righteous indignation, anyway? In March 2003, almost four decades after the Johnson administration escalated the war in Vietnam under false pretences, the Bush administration led the US and several of its allies to war against Saddam Hussein’s Iraq on the basis of erroneous information about “weapons of mass destruction”. In the two years following September 11, 2001, president George W. Bush and seven of his administration’s top officials made at least 935 false statements about the national security threat posed by Iraq, as my researchers and I reported in 2008. The number of these statements spiked upwards at politically strategic moments – specifically before the October 2002 congressional vote on the war, and between January and March 2003, from Secretary of State Colin Powell’s presentation to the United Nations to the invasion itself. The carefully orchestrated campaign about Iraq’s supposed weapons of mass destruction led the nation to war under decidedly false pretences. The cumulative effect of these incorrect, bellicose statements – amplified by thousands of uncritical news stories and broadcasts – was massive. Worse, much of the saturation media coverage provided additional, “independent” validation of the Bush administration’s misstatements about Iraq. Five years after the invasion of Iraq, reporter David Barstow of the New York Times exposed how the Pentagon had quietly recruited 75 retired military officers to be “independent”, paid consultant, radio and television analysts. In numerous meetings and thousands of emails, they were secretly coached about precisely how to make the public case for war in Iraq on the air. Many of these military experts also had significant, undisclosed financial ties to defence companies that were benefiting from the policies they were “analysing”. The broadcast news media essentially ignored these stunning revelations, neither acknowledging their own dubious use of such compromised “talking heads” nor apologising to the public for their irresponsible propagation of the government’s propaganda. Unfortunately, most national reporters and their news organisations were figuratively embedded in the almost impenetrable din of official disinformation. But to paraphrase Bradlee’s <b>excellent</b> <b>question</b> about Vietnam, what might have happened if the public had discovered the truth about the actual threat posed by Iraq in 2002 instead of years later? Two distant quagmires, 20 years of massive bloodshed in wars in Vietnam and Iraq, might have been avoided, and trillions of taxpayer dollars saved, if the American people had been better informed with real-time truth about the specious official statements. But the largest cumulative loss of life resulting from propaganda and deception in the last century was actually not from Adolf Hitler and his Third Reich or any other genocidal despot. It was from monstrously duplicitous industries that manufacture deadly products. And no industry has been more deceitful or caused more human carnage than the tobacco companies. In the 20 th century, 100 million people around the world died from smoking-related illnesses, according to the World Health Organization. And that number is expected to soar to an estimated one billion smoking-related deaths in this century. In 2006, a US federal judge ruled that they had violated the federal racketeering laws, and while: …selling a highly addictive product which causes diseases that lead to a staggering number of deaths per year…for at least 50 years or more…they have consistently, repeatedly, and with enormous skill and sophistication, denied these facts to the public, to the government, and to the public health community. But, of course, deliberately blowing smoke about their deadly products has hardly been limited to the cigarette manufacturers. The asbestos, coal, chemical, lead paint, pharmaceutical and many other industries have profited from the same modus operandi. Sometimes the specific subterfuge has been independently exposed by tenacious journalists, but too often years after the fact and, tragically, sometimes decades so. This disturbing phenomenon unfortunately continues today, but now our professional ranks are fewer. Now we have a vastly reduced number of traditional truth-tellers and a growing number of well-paid poseurs who advise their clients on how to circumvent or “spin” those asking critical, independent questions, including journalists. In the United States today, we have one-third fewer newspaper/print reporters today than we had 20 years ago. And meanwhile, according to authors John Nichols and Robert McChesney, the ratio of public relations people to working journalists has gone from nearly one to one in 1960 to now four “flacks” for every one working journalist. Not surprisingly under the circumstances, a disturbing proportion of daily newspaper stories today are based upon press releases. British journalist Nick Davies labelled this lamentable practice “churnalism” in his 2008 book, Flat Earth News. In 2011, the non-profit organisation Media Standards Trust in the United Kingdom launched the churnalism. com website, that “lets people compare press releases with published news articles”. The work of journalists has made a significant impact on contemporary US history. They have fearlessly exposed abuses of power, from the “red scare” demagoguery of Senator Joseph McCarthy in the early 1950 s to atrocities during the Vietnam War, the Watergate scandal and the various heinous excesses of corporate power over many decades. More recently, reporters have revealed the various improper uses of US power in post- 9 / 11 America. Since 2005, in preparation for a book, I have been conducting video/audio oral history interviews with 25 important national journalists – from Carl Bernstein and Bob Woodward and Ben Bradlee to Seymour Hersh, Dana Priest and Daniel Schorr – who through their work effectively have stood up to power. This multimedia online presentation at www. investigatingpower. org includes career and iconic “moments of truth” timelines and related reference material. It is an ongoing companion to The Future of Truth, which will be released next year, and also fodder for a multi-hour television documentary series. I wanted to learn more about these important truth-tellers and the legions of other hearty souls like them, in part to educate future generations about the importance of this kind of reporting. In the 21 st century, our finite, non-sustainable, inter-connected world is at a critical crossroads. How will our elected leaders address the most pressing issues of our time, such as climate change, the shortage of water, the growing rich-poor inequalities and related human migrations? In the US and other democracies, any attempt at honest, effective governance, of course, is predicated upon the widespread availability of timely, accurate information. Given the profound international dimensions of what we are all facing, investigative news-gathering must necessarily widen and become more global. But even in the 21 st century, most news coverage is still overwhelmingly local or national. We must think anew about who we are, what we do, why we do it, technologically how we do it and for whom. We must identify kindred souls who also investigate the uses and abuses of power, who also have exacting professional standards and approach their subjects with an independent scepticism and distance. They should meticulously peruse secondary and primary written sources, and then interview the relevant secondary and then primary human sources. The fact is, thousands of academics today function as de facto in-depth journalists – from the forensic accountants to the political scientists tracking political corruption, from economists to investigative historians, from public anthropologists to those who work in data-mining, statistics, and human rights, environmental and other law-related specialties. I have formally proposed at American University a new interdisciplinary field of study that can help to broaden and redefine the practice of journalism. I am calling it “accountability studies”. Whether or not we want to acknowledge it, many intelligent, talented young people who would like to become professional journalists but can’t find a job will increasingly join the ranks of another public-minded, “knowledge worker” profession. They may instead become researchers, writers and editors at non-government organisations (there are 1. 5 million NGOs in the US alone), including policy-related, specialised subject think tanks. This is certainly not a panacea for the drop in the number of journalists – these organisations have points of view that they advocate softly or not so softly. But, for example, who covers human rights more thoroughly: Human Rights Watch, with 280 full-time employees and offices in 16 cities around the world, or the premier newspaper in the US, UK or Australia? I’m afraid there is no comparison. Virtually all of these folks are highly educated and write careful, well-documented, scholarly and more popular articles, op-ed essays, blogs and books, all accessible and published online. Imagine if more of these silo walls came down and social scientists and journalists in individual countries and across national borders began to communicate and collaborate more about the most important issues of our time. And there are vast resources available that are not commercial advertising, but instead philanthropic foundations and individual concerned citizens who spend hundreds of millions of dollars a year in the United States alone to enable the publication of high quality, well-written information. In the spirit of such confluences, I note the innovation in Australia of The Conversation website, now operating also in the UK and beginning to develop in the US, which melds the grey matter and research and writing talents of energetic academics who find the op-ed gatekeepers of traditional newspapers to be too exclusionary and limited. And it is also in that spirit of collaboration that American University and my Investigative Reporting Workshop have jointly hired a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter with The Washington Post. This is unprecedented and may be, I believe, the beginning of a new way forward for both truth-telling and new future economic strategies and models. My modus operandi is that it is better to try and fail, than not to have tried at all. Why? Because given the present circumstances, there is too little time and there are too many subjects and frankly just too many bastards to investigate in this intricate, imperilled world we live in. We must broaden our views about who is “worthy” to gather and publish information outside our profession; we can and we must adapt and play in the sandbox with others. What drives me is a pressing sense of urgency, for the abuses of power in the world today far, far exceed our collective capacities to investigate and expose them. We – along with the other inquisitive, investigative professions – are society’s proverbial canaries in the mineshaft. We must all work together to attempt to enlarge the public space for watchdog or accountability journalism, in the US and around the world.   This article was originally published in The Conversation.

40|$|I {{would like}} to begin by thanking the organizers, Lone, Berner, and Chris, for the {{invitation}} to participate, albeit at a distance, in this panel. In an address delivered at the 1971 American Anthropology meeting, Moerman and Sacks argued for a new program of study with understanding as its core construct. They raised the following three questions: What forms of social organization secure the recurrence of understanding among parties to conversation, the central institution of language use? What forms of social organization get participants to occasions of talk {{to do the work}} of understanding the talk of others in the very way and at the very times at which they demonstrably do that work? And what are the understandings which those forms secure? (1988 : 182) These are <b>excellent</b> orienting <b>questions.</b> In his lectures, Sacks stated several times that their earlier focus on understanding in conversation was largely opportunistic—they directed their attention to recordings of conversation because {{it was a kind of}} data that was plentiful and ready-to-hand. Today there are othe...|$|R
40|$|The {{analysis}} of social networks {{has come to}} remain long time in social sciences. Nevertheless, the tendency to consider it as an almost infallible repertoire of analysis instruments is still a temptation for its followers and also {{for those who do}} not frequent it but sees in it a kind of chimera able to respond any <b>excellent</b> theoretical <b>question.</b> According with these reflections, we will present a more or less typical division of the different stages that distinguish to an investigation of SNA to try to explain, in them, some of problematic and the methodologic decisions that can seriously affect the validity of the data, calculations and inferences. Beyond the technical specificity of the questions that we will review respect to the SNA, we have the most general objective to analyze its peculiarities under the perspective of any research process that considers a few classic topics of the scientific acquisition of knowledge: integrity, relevance and representativeness of the data, adjustment and reach of the handled hypotheses, deductive consistency of the obtained conclusions, and, finally, the possibility to generate modifications in the own object of study with the purpose of producing changes guided by a certain design of intervention...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: Important success {{factors for}} the Occupational Health Service (OHS) include {{services}} being based on active participation and risk identification from a multidisciplinary/multifactorial perspective. Despite an extensive search, no questionnaire {{with this approach}} was found so a new questionnaire was developed at the OHS. The {{aim of this study}} was to develop and validate the new questionnaire named Structured Multidisciplinary work Evaluation Tool (SMET) through action research. METHOD: Communicative and pragmatic validity were tested through the development of the questionnaire using action theory and presented in a descriptive portrayal. The Content Validity Index (CVI) was used to test content validity for each item as well as for the questionnaire as a whole. RESULT: Communicative and pragmatic validity were developed and tested over time in four different periods between 2008 and 2014, in 24 clinics (with a total of approximately 1000 employees) in Region Jönköping County. The content validity of the SMET questionnaire as a whole was close to excellent and the validity of the questions regarding physically and psychosocially demanding work factors were found to be <b>excellent.</b> The <b>questions</b> regarding environmentally demanding work factors were found to have a lower, but still good, validity. CONCLUSION: The SMET questionnaire has very good content validity. The pervasive work with the SMET questionnaire also shows good pragmatic and communicative validity...|$|R

He replied, without the slightest hesitation, that it certainly was the passion for getting your newspaper in advance of your fellow-creatures; also, if you only hired it, to get it delivered at your own door {{at exactly the same}} time as another man who hired the same copy four miles off; and, finally, the invincible determination {{on the part of both}} men not to believe the time was up when the boy called.|$|R
40|$|Purpose: To {{develop and}} {{validate}} a Farsi version of Ocular Surface Disease Index (OSDI) for the Iranian population. Methods: This {{study was a}} translation and cross-cultural adaptation and validation of Farsi version of OSDI. Four bilingual (English-Persian) individual including three physicians and one native English teacher were asked to translate the original English OSDI questionnaire in Farsi. Following back and forth translation, integration and pilot check, the translation team came to consensus on translation. consecutive patients visited in ophthalmology clinic, underwent comprehensive general ophthalmology exam and specific assessments for dry eye including non-anesthetic Schirmer's test, fluorescein tear break-up time, Fluorescein and Rose Bengal staining and Farsi OSDI (F-OSDI). F-OSDI was again rechecked within 2 - 7 days after the examination. Results: Forty-four participants were enrolled into study. Thirty-two (72. 7 %) were male and 12 (27. 3 %) female. Mean age of participants was 45. 5 (SD = ± 15. 97, range = 18 - 80) years. Twenty five percent were less than 31 years old and 10 % percent older than 65. The cronbach's alpha for the questionnaire was 0. 807. Questions number 7, 8 showed <b>excellent,</b> and <b>question</b> 12 showed good internal consistency, respectively. There was a significant correlation between all pre measures and post assessments. Conclusion: The obtained F-OSDI showed acceptable internal consistency and test-retest reliability. This F-OSDI {{could be used for}} assessment of dry eye, ocular surface discomfort and quality of life in Iranian and Farsi speaking populations...|$|R
40|$|Introduction: Nothing {{great in}} the world has been {{accomplished}} without passion. Georg Wilhelm Friedrich Hegel (1770 - 1831) Is passion needed for <b>excellent</b> performance? The <b>question</b> of what predicts outstanding performance at work remains timely and relevant. The term “passion for work” emerged from qualitative research on entrepreneurs’ motivation, and has been defined as a selfish, passionate love for the work (Shane, Locke & Collins, 2003). Passion for work has been proposed as key to understanding entrepreneurial behavior and performance. Passion is “… the enthusiasm, joy, and even zeal that come from the energetic and unflagging pursuit of a worthy, challenging and uplifting purpose” (Smilor, 1997, as cited in Shane at al., 2003). However, few attempts have been made so far as to operationalize the construct, let alone relate it to entrepreneurial behaviour. The current chapter aims to fill this void, by focusing on work engagement and workaholism as two motivational concepts indicating “passion for work”...|$|R
40|$|Background The {{purpose of}} this review was to {{determine}} the most valid and reliable questions for targeting key modes of sedentary behaviour (SB) in a broad range of national and international health surveillance surveys. This was done by reviewing the SB modules currently used in population health surveys, as well as examining SB questionnaires that have performed well in psychometric testing. Methods Health surveillance surveys were identified via scoping review and contact with experts in the field. Previous systematic reviews provided psychometric information on pediatric questionnaires. A comprehensive search of four bibliographic databases was used to identify studies reporting psychometric information for adult questionnaires. Only surveys/studies published/used in English or French were included. Results The review identified a total of 16 pediatric and 18 adult national/international surveys assessing SB, few of which have undergone psychometric testing. Fourteen pediatric and 35 adult questionnaires with psychometric information were included. While reliability was generally good to <b>excellent</b> for <b>questions</b> targeting key modes of SB, validity was poor to moderate, and reported much less frequently. The most valid and reliable questions targeting specific modes of SB were combined to create a single questionnaire targeting key modes of SB. Discussion Our results highlight the importance of including SB questions in survey modules that are adaptable, able to assess various modes of SB, and that exhibit adequate reliability and validity. Future research could investigate the psychometric properties of the module we have proposed in this paper, as well as other questionnaires currently used in national and international population health surveys...|$|R
40|$|Purpose: The current {{versions}} of the Adapted Fresno test (AFT) are limited to physiotherapists and occupational therapists, and new scenarios and scoring rubrics are required for other allied health disciplines. The {{aim of this study}} was to examine the validity, reliability, and internal consistency of the AFT developed for speech pathologists (SPs), social workers (SWs), and dieticians/nutritionists (DNs). Materials and methods: An expert panel from each discipline was formed to content-validate the AFT. A draft instrument, including clinical scenarios, questionnaire, and scoring rubric, was developed. The new versions were completed by ten SPs, 16 SWs, and 12 DNs, and scored by four raters. Interrater reliability was calculated using intraclass correlation coefficients (2, 1) for the individual AFT items and the total score. The internal consistency of the AFT was examined using Cronbach's α. Results: Two new clinical scenarios and a revised scoring rubric were developed for each discipline. The reliability among raters was <b>excellent</b> for <b>questions</b> 1, 3, and 6 across all disciplines. <b>Question</b> 7 showed <b>excellent</b> reliability for SPs, but not for SWs and DNs. All other reliability coefficients increased to moderate or excellent levels following training. Cronbach's α was 0. 71 for SPs, 0. 68 for SWs, and 0. 74 for DNs, indicating that internal consistency was acceptable for all disciplines. Conclusion: There is preliminary evidence to show that AFT is a valid and reliable tool for the assessment of evidence-based practice knowledge and skills of SPs, SWs, and DNs. Further research is required to establish its sensitivity to detect change in knowledge and skills following an educational program. Lucylynn Lizarondo, Karen Grimmer, Saravana Kuma...|$|R
40|$|AbstractPurposeWe {{aimed to}} compare the extent of inter-observer {{variability}} {{in the description of}} seizure semiology between both neurologists and caregivers. MethodWe prospectively investigated 93 consecutive patients monitored over the past 5 years in our video–EEG unit. The videotaped seizures of the patients were reviewed independently by two neurologists who were blind to the clinical data. The questionnaires were completed by neurologists and caregivers. Interobserver rate of agreement between neurologists and caregivers was analyzed by using the kappa analysis and intraclass correlation coefficients. ResultsThere was <b>excellent</b> agreement for <b>questions</b> regarding whether the patient's eyes remained open, laterality of head deviation, arm movements, and ictal period. On the other hand, interobserver rate of agreement was fair to moderate for the laterality of hand automatisms, the presence of nose-wiping, and oral clonic jerks. ConclusionBesides variability in interobserver agreement among clinicians, the variability or concordance between physicians and caregivers are also of great importance, especially in case of epilepsy, where the accurate description of the attacks is the major determinant of an accurate diagnosis...|$|R

Are their consecutivegame winning and losing streaks self-reinforcing or can they be described statistically? We apply the Bradley-Terry model, which incorporates the heterogeneity of team strengths in a minimalist way, to answer these <b>questions.</b> <b>Excellent</b> agreement is found between the predictions of the Bradley-Terry model and the rank dependence of the average number team wins and losses in major-league baseball {{over the past century}} when the distribution of team strengths is taken to be uniformly distributed over a finite range. Using this uniform strength distribution, we also find very good agreement between model predictions and the observed distribution of consecutive-game team winning and losing streaks over the last half-century; however, the agreement is less good for the previous half-century. The behavior of the last half-century supports the hypothesis that long streaks are primarily statistical in origin with little self-reinforcing component. The data further show that the past half-century of baseball has been more competitive than the preceding half-century. PACS. 89. 75. -k Complex systems – 02. 50. Cw Probability theory...|$|R
