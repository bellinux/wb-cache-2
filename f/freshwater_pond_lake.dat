50|$|Naegleria fowleri is a {{thermophilic}} (heat-loving), free-living amoeba. It {{is found}} in warm and hot <b>freshwater</b> <b>ponds,</b> <b>lakes</b> and rivers, and in the very warm water of hot springs. As the water temperature rises, its numbers increase. The amoeba was identified in the 1960s in Australia but appears to have evolved in the United States.N. fowleri occurs in three forms - as a cyst, a trophozoite (ameboid), and a biflagellate (it has two flagella). It does not form a cyst in human tissue, where only the amoeboid trophozoite stage exists. The flagellate form can exist in the cerebrospinal fluid.|$|R

50|$|The protozoon Vorticella {{campanula}} {{is found}} in <b>freshwater</b> <b>ponds,</b> <b>lakes,</b> rivers, and streams with aquatic vegetation. It has a global distribution. Vorticella campanula is solitary and not colonial but usually social, several of them being found together. Vorticella campanula is a sedentary (fixed) form. It is commonly attached by a long highly contractile stalk to some submerged objects like weeds, animals, or stones. Vorticella campanula is often found in large groups. All the individuals in the group, however, remain free and independent of each other. Most Vorticella are found in abundance in stagnant water rich in decaying organic matter and feed largely on bacteria, but Vorticella campanula live only in uncontaminated water where bacterial growth is poor.|$|R

40|$|Hydro-raking is one {{management}} {{option to}} control non-native invasive and native nuisance plants in <b>freshwater</b> <b>ponds</b> and <b>lakes</b> in Massachusetts. The hydro-rake is a floating pontoon boat with paddlewheels and a long, giant rake that scoops plants from <b>pond</b> or <b>lake</b> bottoms. Analyzing eight case studies in Massachusetts where hydro-raking occurred, this thesis provides a comprehensive overview {{of when the}} process would be recommended or not. The results, displayed in a decision tree guide the reader through questions to test for suitability of the water body they manage. The water level needs to be between one and twelve feet, and the <b>pond</b> or <b>lake</b> requires shore access for the machinery. Plants recommended for hydro-raking in Massachusetts are rooted floating plants and emergent shoreline plants. Plants not recommended for removal through hydro-raking include species that spread through fragmentation. Organic debris and trash are also recommended for removal with the hydro-rake...|$|R

40|$|The {{relationship}} of merA gene expression (specifying the enzyme mercuric reductase) to mercury volatilization in aquatic microbial communities was investigated with samples collected at a mercury-contaminated <b>freshwater</b> <b>pond,</b> Reality <b>Lake,</b> in Oak Ridge, Tenn. Levels of merA mRNA transcripts {{and the rate}} of inorganic mercury [Hg(II) ] volatilization were related to the concentration of mercury in the water and to heterotrophic activity in field samples and laboratory incubations of pond water in which microbial heterotrophic activity and Hg(II) concentration were manipulated. Levels of merA-specific mRNA and Hg(II) volatilization were influenced more by microbial metabolic activity than by the concentration of mercury. merA-specific transcripts were detected in some samples which did not reduce Hg(II), suggesting that rates of mercury volatilization in environmental samples may not always be proportional to merA expression...|$|R

40|$|Despite the {{frequent}} application of diatoms in palaeoecological {{research in the}} High Arctic, our knowledge concerning the diversity, ecology, community associations, community dynamics and survival strategies of High Arctic freshwater littoral diatom floras is still rather limited. In the present study, the diversity, ecological characteristics and community structures of the freshwater littoral diatom flora from <b>ponds</b> and <b>lakes</b> of Petuniabukta (Spitsbergen, Svalbard Archipelago) were studied. In total, 87 samples from the littoral zone of 53 <b>freshwater</b> <b>ponds</b> and <b>lakes</b> were examined using light and scanning electron microscopy. A highly diverse diatom flora dominated by Achnanthidium and Nitzschia was observed. In total, 310 diatom taxa belonging to 59 genera were found, of which about one-third could not be identified beyond the genus level. Based on species composition, four main diatom communities were distinguished. Differences in environmental characteristics, such as habitat type, habitat diversity, habitat stability, streams, water pH and influence of the fjord, biota and human activities, appeared to be important factors in determining the observed diatom communities. The high number of unidentified taxa in this study indicates that a profound revision of the Arctic diatom flora is highly desired, not only to improve our fundamental knowledge concerning the diversity, ecology, community associations and biogeography of Arctic diatoms but also to aid applied (palaeo) environmental sciences...|$|R

We report a case of N. fowleri meningitis in a 6 -year-old boy who presented with signs and symptoms of acute bacterial meningitis. No history of travelling or swimming was present. However, the boy frequently played with water stored from a "kuhl" (diversion channels of water). Wet mount of cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) revealed amoeboid and actively motile flagellate forms of trophozoites. CSF culture done on 1. 5 % non-nutrient agar plates with a lawn culture of Escherichia coli kept at 37 °C for 15 days did not reveal any growth. The test of flagellation on passing CSF in distilled water was however positive in 3 h. Water of the "kuhl" from the stored tank also showed actively motile trophozoites similar to the forms obtained from the CSF. Based on our reports, the boy was immediately treated with amphotericin B, rifampicin and fluconazole for 21 days.
