25|$|Meanwhile, Evie {{looks for}} the Piece of Eden, {{managing}} to steal an Assassin journal from Thorne. Analyzing the journal, Evie discovers that {{it refers to the}} Shroud of Eden, a Piece of Eden that can heal any injury, including old age, and makes the wearer immortal. She follows the trail of clues underneath the mansion of , where she finds a map detailing the locations of all of the Assassin vaults hidden in London. Her search leads her to famous landmarks such as the Monument to the Great Fire of London and St. Paul's Cathedral. She obtains the key needed to access the Shroud's vault, but it is stolen by Thorne. Evie then heads to the Tower of London, where the vault is located and assassinates Thorne. Thorne explains the Shroud is not in the Tower and claims that the Assassins <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the true power of the Shroud before dying. Green believes the real vault is hidden in Buckingham Palace, and enlists the aid of the Maharajah Duleep Singh to find the schematics for the building. Unfortunately, the Templars manage to seize the schematics first. In addition to her hunt for the Shroud, Evie also helps correct the unintended consequences Jacob's assassinations have caused such as medicine shortages and currency inflation.|$|E
500|$|As {{the end of}} term approaches, Rook begins getting strange emails about Isabella's death, {{and begins}} seeing shinigami figures. Upset by these occurrences, when Akira's mother asks {{to speak to him}} {{concerning}} misuses of Amie, he assumes that she has found out that he is spying on the students' conversations. When he meets her, he finds that Isabella is alive and had simply moved away; the students made it look like she was dead via Amie as a prank that got out of control. Furthermore, they already knew that he could see their messages; Akira's mother explains that the students <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> online privacy, having always had technology like Amie, and assumed that anything they put online—even [...] "private" [...] messages—might be read by anyone. The game ends with Rook having a casual lunch with the students, a date with Arianna, or neither, depending on the choices made during the game by the player.|$|E

500|$|The {{circumstances}} of Mackintosh's death have led commentators to emphasise his impetuousness and incompetence. This generally negative view {{of him was}} not, however, unanimous among his comrades. Stevens, [...] the [...] party's [...] scientist, found Mackintosh [...] "steadfast and reliable", and believed that the Ross Sea party would have achieved much less [...] but for Mackintosh's unwearying drive. John King Davis, too, admired Mackintosh's dedication and called the depot-laying journey a [...] "magnificent achievement". Shackleton was equivocal. In South he acknowledges that Mackintosh and his men achieved their object, praises the party's qualities of endurance and self-sacrifice, and asserts that Mackintosh died for his country. On the other hand, in a letter home, he is highly critical: [...] "Mackintosh seemed to <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> discipline or organisation...". Shackleton did, however, donate part of the proceeds from a short New Zealand lecture tour to assist the Mackintosh family. His son, Lord Shackleton, in a much later assessment of the expedition, wrote: [...] "Three men in particular emerge as heroes: Captain Aeneas Mackintosh, ... Dick Richards, and Ernest Joyce." ...|$|E
500|$|Reardon and Yeates' friends set up {{a website}} and used social {{networking}} services to help look for her. On 21 December 2010, Yeates' parents and Reardon made a public appeal for her safe return at a police press conference. In another press conference, broadcast live on 23 December 2010 by Sky News and BBC News, Yeates' father David commented on her disappearance: [...] "I think she was abducted after getting home to her flat ... I <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> {{the circumstances of the}} abduction because of what was left behind ... I feel sure she would not have gone out by herself leaving all these things behind and she was taken away somewhere". Her keys, phone, purse and coat were left behind at her flat. Detectives retrieved a receipt for a pizza, but found no sign of it or of its packaging. Both bottles of cider were found in the flat, one of them partially consumed. As {{there was no evidence of}} forced entry or a struggle, investigators began to examine the possibility that Yeates may have known her abductor.|$|E
500|$|According to The Sunday Mail a 2004 {{newspaper}} report {{notes that}} [...] "no worries" [...] {{has begun to}} be used in American English. Writing in a 2004 article for The Advertiser, Samela Harris comments: [...] "The Americans <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the etymology of 'no worries'. So, while they may cheerily adopt our 'no worries' mantra, 'no worries' will never catch on as an attitude." [...] According to Tom Dalzell, author of two books on slang usage in the United States, linguistics experts are not certain how the expression became popular in that country. Usage of the term by Steve Irwin on The Crocodile Hunter, as well as attempts by members of the American press to imitate the expression during the 2000 Sydney Olympics, have been put forth as theories explaining the pervasiveness of the expression in the United States. Linguistics professor Kate Burridge writes in her 2004 book Weeds In the Garden Of Words that expressions including [...] "no worries", [...] "absolutely", and [...] "bottom line" [...] have become less prevalent in favor of newer sayings. The phrase has had some usage in Canadian English.|$|E

500|$|The {{gameplay}} was {{the second}} element created for the game, following the graphics created by Jensen. The gameplay was created and refined using rudimentary graphic elements to establish the types of puzzles they wanted to have, but aware of how these elements would {{be presented to the}} player in the released version. Limbo was designed to avoid the pitfalls of major titles, where the same gameplay mechanic is used repeatedly. Carlsen, initially brought aboard as a programmer for the custom game engine, became the lead designer after Playdead found him to be capable at creating puzzles. Carlsen stated that the puzzles within Limbo were designed to [...] " [...] you guessing all the way through". Jensen also wanted to make the puzzles feel like a natural part of the environment, and to avoid the feeling that the player was simply moving from puzzle to puzzle through the course of the game. Carlsen identified examples of puzzles from other games that he wanted to avoid. He wanted to avoid simple puzzles that gave the player little satisfaction in its solution, such as a puzzle in [...] that involved simply moving a sun-lit mirror to specific points in a room. In contrast, Carlsen wanted to avoid making the puzzle so complex with many separate parts that the player would resort to trial-and-error and eventually come out with the solution without thinking about why the solution worked; Carlsen used an example of a puzzle from the 2008 Prince of Persia game that had seven different mechanics that he never bothered to figure out himself. Carlsen designed Limbo puzzles to fall between these limits, demonstrating one puzzle that only has three elements: a switch panel, an electrified floor, and a chain; the goal—to use the chain to cross the electrified floor—is immediately obvious to the player, and then tasks the player to determine the right combination of moves and timing to complete it safely. They often had to strip away elements to make the puzzles more enjoyable and easier to figure out. The decision to provide little information to the player was an initial challenge in creating the game. From their initial pool of about 150 playtesters, several would <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> how to solve certain puzzles. To improve this, they created scenarios before troublesome spots that highlighted the appropriate actions; for example, when they found players did not think about pulling a boat onto shore to use as a platform to reach a higher ledge, they presented the player with a box-pulling puzzle earlier to demonstrate the pulling mechanics.|$|E

On the contrary there is ample evidence, derived not from hasty travellers, but from men who have long resided with savages, that numerous races have existed, and still exist, who <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> one or more gods, and who have no words in their languages to express such an idea. The question is of course wholly distinct from that higher one, whether there exists a Creator and Ruler of the universe; and this has been answered in the affirmative by some of the highest intellects that have ever existed." ...|$|E
2500|$|In many regards, The Getaway was a {{frustrating}} repeat {{of his earlier}} experience with Kubrick. Thompson wrote a script, but Steve McQueen (who was cast in the movie's lead role of Doc McCoy) rejected it as too reliant on dialogue, with not enough action. Though Walter Hill was given the sole script credit, Thompson insisted that much of his script {{ended up in the}} film. Thompson sought Writers Guild arbitration but the Guild ultimately ruled against him. In the end, the film was heavily bowdlerized from Thompson's original vision and as King writes, [...] "if you have seen only the film version of The Getaway, you <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> the existential horrors awaiting Doc and Carol McCoy at the point where Sam Peckinpah ended the story." ...|$|E

[...] "I think my grandmother saw my potential first," [...] he said. [...] "When I was young, I told her, 'I think I should get a job.' She said, 'No, just keep boxing.'" [...] During the 1980s, Mayweather lived in the Hiram Square neighborhood of New Brunswick, New Jersey, where his mother had relatives. He later said, [...] "When I was about eight or nine, I lived in New Jersey with my mother and we were seven deep in one bedroom and sometimes we didn't have electricity. When people see what I have now, they <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> where I came from and how I didn't have anything growing up." ...|$|E

[...] Sylvester believed that both European ministers and White House officials regard him as a joke.

2500|$|Smooth-talking and debonair, {{known as}} [...] "Jerry Belvedere" [...] {{to those who}} <b>have</b> <b>no</b> <b>idea</b> <b>of</b> his true identity, the Devil (played by Ray Wise) claims the rights to Sam's soul thanks to a deal he made with Sam's parents before Sam was even born. Although he knows how it all ends ("God wins"), he is {{determined}} to do as much as he can to oppose God until the end. He also convinces Sam that he (Sam) is doing good by clearing the world of the escaped evil souls. Aside from Sam, Morgan, Cady, and Andi at least once, the Devil never appears before any of Sam's friends face-to-face, despite the Devil knowing all about Sock and Ben, and them being aware that they know Sam's secret job of being a reaper for the Devil. In the finale of Season Two Andi sells her soul to the devil in an attempt to free Sam from his own deal.|$|E
