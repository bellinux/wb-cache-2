5|$|In 1933, the Pennsylvania Railroad {{decided to}} replace the P5, and {{instructed}} General Electric and Westinghouse to design an electric locomotive that was {{more powerful than the}} P5, capable of speeds of , have a lighter axle load and to be <b>double-ended</b> with a cab {{in the center of the}} carbody. Westinghouse designed the R1 #4800, and General Electric submitted the GG1, then numbered 4899.|$|E
5|$|The Admiral Hipper-class {{ships were}} powered by {{three sets of}} geared steam {{turbines}}. Admiral Hippers and Blüchers engines were built by Blohm & Voss, while Prinz Eugens turbines were built by Germaniawerft. The turbines installed on Seydlitzs and Lützows engines were manufactured by Deschimag. Steam was provided {{in the first three}} ships by twelve ultra-high-pressure boilers. Seydlitz and Lützow were equipped with nine <b>double-ended</b> high-pressure boilers. Admiral Hippers and Prinz Eugens boilers were manufactured by Wagner, while the boilers for the other three ships were built by La Mont.|$|E
5|$|A {{series of}} initial ideas were {{presented}} to the Southern Railway management by Bulleid that incorporated <b>double-ended</b> running, giving the locomotive driver maximum visibility in either direction without a boiler or tender obscuring his view. The need for a turntable to turn the locomotive was therefore eliminated, although the initial designs were rejected by the operating department because of problems with welding technique. The accepted design included two 0-6-0 steam bogies with weight-saving sleeve valves and chains to couple the driving axles. The boiler was offset to provide space for a communication corridor, allowing the driver to access both cabs without leaving the locomotive, an arrangement which led to later problems. The firebox, near {{the centre of the}} locomotive, was fed by the fireman from a third cab, linked to both driving cabs by the communication corridor. The entire ensemble was placed on a common frame and thus often referred to as an 0-6-6-0 tank engine, even though the actual notation is 0-6-0+0-6-0 since both engine units pivoted as on a Garratt, Double Fairlie or Meyer locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The long-ship, the key {{to their}} success, was a graceful, long, narrow, light, wooden boat with a shallow draft hull {{designed}} for speed. This shallow draft allowed navigation in waters only one metre deep and permitted beach landings, while its light weight enabled it to be carried over portages. Longships were also <b>double-ended,</b> the symmetrical bow and stern allowing the ship to reverse direction quickly without having to turn around. In the Gàidhealtachd they were eventually succeeded by the Birlinn, highland galley and lymphad, which, in ascending order of size, and which replaced the steering-board with a stern-rudder from the late twelfth century. Forces of ships were raised through obligations of a ship-levy through the system of ouncelands and pennylands, which have been argued to {{date back to the}} muster system of Dál Riata, but were probably introduced by Scandinavian settlers. Later evidence suggests that the supply of ships for war became linked to military feudal obligations. Viking naval power was disrupted by conflicts between the Scandinavian kingdoms, but entered a period of resurgence in the 13th century when Norwegian kings began to build some of the largest ships seen in Northern European waters, until Haakon Haakonson's ill-fated expedition in 1263 left the Scottish crown the most significant power in the region.|$|E
25|$|The first <b>double-ended</b> boiler {{was built}} in 1905 for the Spanish government. The design was already well-suited to being fired from both ends and it was {{discovered}} that <b>double-ended</b> boilers were slightly more efficient in use.|$|E
25|$|Chicago {{ordered the}} first of 770 (720 + 50 <b>double-ended)</b> 6000 series cars in 1948 (before the standard, which they influenced), Boston (40, then later 100) in 1950, and Cleveland (70 + 18 <b>double-ended)</b> in 1952. Chicago's first 200 cars were entirely new, but in 1953 they started using {{components}} salvaged from new, but no longer needed, streetcars. Toronto, on the committee, did not buy any, nor did Brooklyn, who had bought the first five trainsets.|$|E
25|$|Four railcars entered {{service on}} the NCC's lines between 1933 and 1938. They were all <b>double-ended</b> single units with {{underfloor}} engines and running on two four-wheel bogies.|$|E
25|$|Single-ended types, such as stack, {{generally}} only admit {{a single}} peek, {{at the end}} that is modified. <b>Double-ended</b> types, such as deques, admit two peeks, one at each end.|$|E
25|$|The {{combined}} company, the Staten Island and New York Ferry Company, ran {{services from}} Whitehall Street to Tompkinsville, Stapleton, and Clifton. It originally ran single-ended boats but eventually expanded its fleet to include <b>double-ended</b> boats. To accommodate growing ridership, three <b>double-ended</b> boats (Southfield I, Westfield I, and Clifton I) were purchased for the Richmond Turnpike Ferry in the 1850s, and another three (Westfield II, Southfield II, and Middletown) were {{obtained in the}} 1860s. Clifton I and Westfield I were purchased by the Union Army in 1861, who used the ships as blockades against the Confederate Army during the Civil War.|$|E
25|$|A further {{development}} was the Normand-Sigaudy, where two Normand boilers were coupled back-to-back, {{for use in}} large ships. This effectively gave a <b>double-ended</b> Normand (as was later common with the Yarrow) that could be fired from both ends.|$|E
25|$|Crochet hooks {{used for}} Tunisian crochet are {{elongated}} {{and have a}} stopper {{at the end of}} the handle, while <b>double-ended</b> crochet hooks have a hook on both ends of the handle. There is also a double hooked apparatus called a Cro-hook that has become popular.|$|E
25|$|There {{have been}} many {{references}} to dildos in the historical and ethnographic literature. Haberlandt, for example, illustrates single and <b>double-ended</b> wooden dildos from late 19th century Zanzibar. With the invention of modern materials, there appeared the possibility of making dildos of different shapes, sizes, colors and textures.|$|E
25|$|The {{ship had}} four 100 lbf/in2 <b>double-ended</b> {{auxiliary}} boilers. Onboard electricity was supplied by five six-cylinder 900 bhp Allan diesel engines, each powering a 600 kW 220 volt generator. Much of her cargo space was refrigerated. Her navigation equipment included wireless direction finding, and echo sounding device and a gyrocompass.|$|E
25|$|Netley {{was built}} to a design by Sir Samuel Bentham. She was a {{modified}} and somewhat enlarged version of , which was a somewhat smaller version of his Dart-class vessels. Bentham's designs featured little sheer, negative tumblehome, a large-breadth to length ratio with structural bulkheads, and sliding keels. They were also virtually <b>double-ended.</b>|$|E
25|$|The local fishermen, {{particularly}} at Portland, developed a purpose-built vessel {{to withstand the}} sea actions of Chesil Beach. The boat, known as a Lerret, is a <b>double-ended</b> open fishing boat - 16–17 feet long - used for seine net fishing. It is usually rowed by four people with a fifth to steer and deploy the net.|$|E
25|$|MUNI {{has another}} 30 unrestored PCC cars in {{long-term}} storage. The unrestored cars include five additional San Francisco <b>double-ended</b> cars, 10 San Francisco single-ended cars, 12 single-ended cars acquired from St. Louis in 1957, two single-ended cars from Philadelphia, and two single-ended cars from Pittsburgh. A further previously restored car from Philadelphia was written off after a traffic accident in 2003.|$|E
25|$|The Central London Stock was {{retired from}} service, {{with the last}} run in regular service being on 10 June 1939, {{followed}} by a farewell special on 12 July 1939. Afterwards, 36 of the cars were rebuilt into 18 sleet locomotives, numbered ESL100–ESL117, the driving ends of each car joined to make one <b>double-ended</b> vehicle. One of these trains {{can be found at}} the London Transport Museum Acton Depot.|$|E
25|$|The GAU-8/A {{ammunition}} is linkless, reducing {{weight and}} avoiding {{a great deal}} of potential for jamming. The feed system is <b>double-ended,</b> allowing the spent casings to be recycled back into the ammunition drum, instead of ejected from the aircraft, which would require considerable force to eliminate potential airframe damage. The feed system is based on that developed for later M61 installations, but uses more advanced design techniques and materials throughout, to save weight.|$|E
25|$|Between Bewdley North and Bewdley South {{the double}} track section through {{platforms}} 1 & 2 is signalled with absolute block. The single track through platform 3 is signalled with direction lever. The line furthest {{from the main}} station buildings, known as the Rock siding, is a <b>double-ended</b> siding. Whilst {{this means that the}} signalmen need not communicate with one another before arranging movements into or out of this siding from either end, in practise they would liaise before conducting any unusual movement.|$|E
25|$|Since 2000, the Gent tram network {{started to}} receive new {{generation}} Low Floor tram stock, these trams were named HermeLijn (a pun on the Dutch word for ermine). Prior to this, such trams were supplied in Antwerp. Unlike Antwerp, PCC trams used in Gent are <b>double-ended.</b> HermeLijn in Gent, {{of the first}} order have serial number 6301 — 6314. In 2005 another order of 17 HermeLijn trams arrived in Gent (6315 — 6331). Another ten arrived in 2007 (6332 - 6341).|$|E
25|$|Variations can be {{obtained}} by cutting a new tip on the thinner ones a bit further back where the plastic is a little thicker, adding volume to the attack. The rounded ones can be cut to a pointer shape and thinned a fraction with fine sandpaper adding nuance to the heavier attack produced by this pick. Both kinds are made <b>double-ended</b> from the factory, so one end can be left original and the other end customized, the player using the appropriate end for the musical need.|$|E
25|$|Dr. Reynolds {{patterned}} the , <b>double-ended</b> ketch on the Colin Archer design {{used for}} sturdy Norwegian fishing vessels. The boat rose symbolically {{from the ashes}} of the city destroyed by the first atomic bomb but it also rose, over the period of a year and a half, from the small unprepossessing shipyard of Mr. Yotsuda in Miyajimaguchi, across the Inland Sea of Japan from the famous Miyajima Shrine. Until approached by Reynolds, Yotsuda had only built sampans and was struggling to recover financially from the second World War.|$|E
25|$|Some dildos are {{designed}} to be worn in a harness, sometimes called a strap-on harness or strap-on dildo, or to be worn inside, sometimes with vibrating devices attached externally. Strap-on dildos may be <b>double-ended,</b> in which case they are meant to be worn by users who want to experience vaginal or anal penetration while also penetrating a partner. They may also be used for anal penetration of men. If the penetration is done by a female partner to a male partner, the act is known as pegging.|$|E
25|$|A {{fleet of}} PCC streetcars from San Francisco, Philadelphia, and Newark, built between 1946 and 1948, {{operate on the}} line. , MUNI was {{operating}} 27 of these cars, restored to various states of service. Among the restored cars in service, three are original San Francisco <b>double-ended</b> PCC cars. Another 16 cars are single-ended cars acquired from SEPTA in Philadelphia in 1992 (which continues to operate another 18 cars today, retrofitted for ADA compliance), while the remaining 11 cars are single-ended cars acquired from New Jersey Transit in Newark in 2002.|$|E
25|$|All {{these cars}} use {{traditional}} DC traction motors with electromechanical controls manufactured by Westinghouse and can interoperate. The 1500 and 1700 series cars could operate as singletons, {{but in practice}} are always operated as mated pairs. The 1600 series could only operate as married pairs. Originally, the 1500s were <b>double-ended</b> and had two cabs, but were converted to single ended during their midlife overhaul. Headlights are still present on the non-cab ends on the 1500s. The 1700s also have headlights on their non-cab end, but they were built with only one cab.|$|E
25|$|The ferries are {{catamarans}} constructed out of aluminium, {{which was}} quite rare when the initial two crafts were {{constructed in the}} 1970s. The ferries are <b>double-ended</b> {{so that they can}} travel in either direction without turning around. There are four diesel engines in each vessel, one for each propeller. The propulsion system uses a marine version of the same diesel engine used to power many of the diesel buses on the transit system. The ferries can operate with only three engines if required. The ferries are equipped with radar, allowing them to operate in dense fog.|$|E
25|$|The Trolley Festival {{proved so}} {{successful}} it was repeated every year until 1987. In that year, preparation began for {{the introduction of}} a permanent F line. After that year’s festival finished, Muni replaced the old Market Street tracks with new ones, restoring tracks to upper Market Street and recreating a line to Castro. Different types of vintage streetcars were evaluated to provide the backbone of the F-line fleet, resulting in the decision to use the PCC car, due in part to its historic San Francisco transit use. Fourteen such cars were acquired second-hand from Philadelphia to add to three of Muni’s own retired <b>double-ended</b> PCCs.|$|E
25|$|Receiving {{an influx}} of Irish, Italian and other {{immigrants}} in the 1930s, the Castro gradually became an ethnically mixed working-class neighborhood, and it remained so until the mid-1960s. There was originally a cable car line with large <b>double-ended</b> cable cars that ran along Castro Street from Market Street to 29th St., until the tracks were dismantled in 1941 and the cable car line {{was replaced by the}} 24 MUNI bus. The Castro {{is at the end of}} the straight portion of the Market Street thoroughfare, and a mostly residential area follows Market Street as it curves and rises up and around the Twin Peaks mountains.|$|E
25|$|The line used Metropolitan line A60 and A62 sub-surface {{rolling stock}} built by Cravens of Sheffield in two batches between 1960 and 1962. It was {{upgraded}} in 1994 with improved suspension, lighting, heating and ventilation. The rolling stock was regularly interchanged with that {{used on the}} main Metropolitan line and usually carried both East London and Metropolitan line maps, but ELL trains were four-car units with a driving cab at each end, unlike Metropolitan line trains, which, aside from the Chesham shuttle, ran as eight-car trains. Metropolitan line trains were mostly two single-ended units coupled together with fully operational driving cabs at each end: the Met could use any ELL trains, but the ELL could use only <b>double-ended</b> units.|$|E
25|$|Carvel {{construction}} {{dates back}} even earlier. The {{design of the}} luzzu is believed to date {{back at least to}} Phoenician times. A luzzu is a <b>double-ended</b> carvel-built fishing boat from the Maltese islands. Traditionally, they are brightly painted in shades of yellow, red, green and blue, and the bow is normally pointed with a pair of eyes. These eyes may be the modern survival of an ancient Phoenician custom (also practiced by the ancient Greeks); they are sometimes (and probably inaccurately) referred to as the Eye of Horus or of Osiris. The luzzu has survived because it tends to be a sturdy and stable boat even in bad weather. Originally, the luzzu was equipped with sails although nowadays almost all are motorised, with onboard diesel engines being the most common.|$|E
25|$|However, on most railway {{vehicles}} using overhead wire, {{the trolley}} pole {{has given way}} to the bow collector or, later, the pantograph, a folding metal device that presses a wide contact pan against the overhead wire. While more complex than the trolley pole, the pantograph has the advantage of being almost free from dewiring, being more stable at high speed, and being easier to raise and lower automatically. Also, on <b>double-ended</b> trams, they eliminate the need to manually turn the trolley pole when changing direction (although this disadvantage can be overcome to some extent through the use of trolley reversers). The use of pantographs (or bow collectors) exclusively also eliminates the need for wire frogs (switches in the overhead wiring) to make sure the pole goes in the correct direction at junctions.|$|E
25|$|As {{ships of}} wooden {{construction}} {{gave way to}} iron and steel, the cruiser stern—another design without transoms and known variously as the canoe stern, parabolic stern, and the <b>double-ended</b> stern—became the next prominent development in ship stern design, particularly in warships of {{the latter half of}} the 20th century. The intent of this re-design was to protect the steering gear by bringing it below the armor deck. The stern now came to a point rather than a flat panel or a gentle curve, and the counter reached from the sternpost all the way to the taffrail in a continuous arch. It was soon discovered that vessels with cruiser sterns experienced less water resistance when under way than those with elliptical sterns, and between World War I and World War II most merchant ship designs soon followed suit.|$|E
25|$|As of 2017, {{there are}} 17 tram routes, totalling , and serving {{most parts of}} the city, {{including}} three partial ring routes (7, 81 and 94). The routes have a very varied feel, including street running through narrow streets in working-class districts (line 81), cobbled central reservation, reserved track through parkland and woods (line 44), signal-controlled running in tunnels (the premetro lines 3 and 4 in the North–South Axis, and 7), and short stretches in cutting (the old route 18, closed in 2007). Almost all trams are <b>double-ended</b> and all are double-sided, and while some stub termini remain (4, 51, 97), most have loops. The route pattern shows some notable gaps, particularly along major radial routes, because these were originally served by the national network of buurtspoorwegen/tramways vicinaux. These had a gauge of one metre, rather than the Brussels standard gauge, and so the tracks could not easily be taken over when the lines were progressively closed from the 1960s onwards.|$|E
25|$|Each Companion cavalryman was {{equipped}} with a 3-metre <b>double-ended</b> spear/lance with a cornel wood shaft called the xyston. The double spear points meant that, should the xyston break during a battle, the rider need only turn his weapon around to re-arm himself. The Thessalian and Greek cavalry would have been armed similarly to the Companions. The xyston was used to thrust either overarm or underarm with the elbow flexed. This is usefully illustrated in the Alexander Mosaic, King Alexander is shown thrusting with his xyston underarm, whilst immediately behind him a cavalryman is employing the overarm thrust. There {{is no evidence that}} the Macedonian cavalry ever used a two-handed grip on their lances, as did later Sarmatian and Roman lancers. The shaft of the xyston was tapered allowing the point of balance, and therefore the hand grip, to be approximately two thirds of the length of the spear away from the point. During the reign of Alexander the Great most cavalrymen did not carry shields. However, the Companion cavalry of the Antigonid dynasty did carry large, round bossed shields of Thracian origin.|$|E
25|$|In April 1974 the Arts Council of Great Britain gave COUM {{the first}} half of a £1,500 grant. The money stabilised the group, which now {{included}} P-Orridge and Tutti as directors, John Gunni Busck as technical director, and Lelli Maull as musical director. During that year, they made use of various artist-run venues in London, most notably the Art Meeting Place (AMP) in Covent Garden, where they regularly performed during 1974. A number of these works entailed P-Orridge and Tutti exploring the gender balance, including concepts of gender confusion. In one performance at the AWB, which was titled Filth, P-Orridge and Tutti performed sexual acts using a <b>double-ended</b> dildo. COUM were frustrated with the restrictions imposed on them by the Arts Council as a prerequisite for receiving funding; rather than performing at Council-accredited venues, they wanted to perform more spontaneously. In August 1974 they carried out a spontaneous unauthorised piece of performance art in Brook Green, Hammersmith; during the performance, police arrived and put a stop to the event, deeming it obscene.|$|E
25|$|St Ives is an {{historic}} fishing port in west Cornwall {{and offers a}} sheltered harbour for ships in the open waters of the Western Approaches. On 24 December 1838 the schooner Rival was trying to enter the harbour in a gale but came to grief on one of its piers; despite lacking proper rescue boats and equipment five people were saved after much courage and effort by the people ashore. A meeting was held and {{it was decided that}} a proper lifeboat should be built for the town. Francis Adams, a local man, had recently won a prize from the Royal Cornwall Polytechnic Society for designing a <b>double-ended,</b> self-righting lifeboat and he was commissioned to now build one. The Hope entered service in 1840, assisting the Mary Ann of Poole during a storm on 7 April. Hope had fallen out of use by 1860 so the following year the RNLI opened a new lifeboat station at Porthgwidden beach. It proved to be a difficult site to launch from and so in 1867 it was closed. It has since been used as a store.|$|E
