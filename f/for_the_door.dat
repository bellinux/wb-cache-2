5|$|In {{the early}} hours of 31 May 1810, Ernest, by his written account, was struck in the head several times while asleep in bed, {{awakening}} him. He ran <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> where he was wounded in the leg by a sabre. He called for help, and one of his valets, Cornelius Neale, responded and aided him. Neale raised the alarm, and the household soon realised that Ernest's other valet, Joseph Sellis, was not among them, and that the door to Sellis's room was locked. The lock was forced, and Sellis was discovered with his throat freshly cut, a wound apparently self-inflicted. Ernest received several serious wounds during the apparent attack, and required over a month to recover from his injuries. The social reformer and anti-monarchist Francis Place managed to get on the inquest jury and became its foreman. Place went to the office of a barrister friend to study inquest law, and aggressively questioned witnesses. Place also insisted the inquest be opened to the public and press, and so cowed the coroner that he basically ran the inquest himself. Nevertheless, the jury returned a unanimous verdict of suicide against Sellis.|$|E
5|$|Pattle {{had flown}} several patrols {{that morning and}} was {{suffering}} from a high temperature and fever. He had downed a Ju 88 and two Bf 109s on a morning interception to interdict German air operations. One of his victims, a Bf 109 from III./JG 77 crash-landed at Larissa. His success took Pattle's total from 47 to 49. At 17:00 in the afternoon, another raid approached. He was seen, just before an air raid alarm, in the mess, lying on a couch, shivering under the blankets. He was detailed to take a patrol over the lines but during the mission briefing, around 100 German bombers with fighter escort attacked the capital, seeking to attack Allied shipping in the harbour. He ran <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> towards a Hurricane. His adjutant, George Rumsey, tried to stop him, but Pattle was determined to fly. On {{the way to his}} fighter, he narrowly avoided being killed in a strafing attack by a low-flying Bf 110. He took to the skies minutes later. Pattle climbed to gain altitude and headed for Piraeus Harbour at 20,000 feet.|$|E

25|$|In public buildings, {{exterior}} doors should {{open to the}} outside in order to comply with any fire codes that may be in force in that jurisdiction. If the door opens inward {{and there is a}} fire, there can be a crush of people who run <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> and {{they will not be able}} to open it.|$|E
25|$|Doors can be hinged so {{that the}} axis of {{rotation}} {{is not in the}} plane of the door to reduce the space required on the side to which the door opens. This requires a mechanism {{so that the}} axis of rotation is on the side other than that in which the door opens. This is sometimes the case in trains or airplanes, such as <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> to the toilet, which opens inward.|$|E

25|$|In 1946, {{the company}} {{introduced}} their B-series of bus chassis, {{with the engine}} mounted above the front-axle, giving a short front overhang and the door behind the front-axle. The first generation consisted of the B15/B16, the B20/B21/B22 and the B31, primarily divided by weight class, and then by wheelbase. The latter became upgraded in 1948 and renamed 2B20/2B21/2B22 and 3B31. The T31/T32 trolleybus chassis was also available from 1947. In 1950, the next generation was introduced, with the B41/B42, the B61/B62/B63/B64 and later the B83. From then, Scania-Vabis also offered the BF-series chassis, available as BF61/BF62/BF63, which had the engine more conventionally mounted before the front-axle, leaving room <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> on a longer front overhang. From 1954, the B-series came as B51 and B71, and the BF as BF71 and later BF73. In 1959, the B55, B65 and B75, plus the BF75 were introduced, and were from 1963 available as B56, B66 and B76, plus the BF56 and BF76.|$|E

[...] The Boers fled on horseback and Trenchard with his Australians pursued them for [...] [...] The Boers, finding themselves unable to shake off Trenchard's unit, led them into a trap. [...] The Boers rode up a steep slope and disappeared into the valley beyond. [...] When Trenchard made the ridge he saw the Dwarsvlei farmhouse with smoke coming from the chimney. [...] It appeared to Trenchard that the Boers thought they had got away and were eating breakfast unawares. [...] Trenchard placed his troops on the heights around the building and after half an hour's observation, he led a patrol of four men down towards the farmhouse. [...] The remainder of Trenchard's troops were to close in on his signal. [...] However, when Trenchard and his patrol reached the valley floor and broke cover, the Boers opened fire from about a dozen points and bullets whistled past Trenchard and his men. [...] He pressed forward reaching the sheltering wall of the farmhouse. [...] As he headed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door,</b> Trenchard was hit by a Boer bullet to the chest. [...] The Australians, seeing their leader fall, descended from the heights to engage the Boers at close quarters in and around the farmhouse. [...] Many of the Boers were killed or wounded, a few fled and several were taken prisoner. [...] Trenchard being critically wounded was medically evacuated to Krugersdorp.|$|E

[...] No single person is given both combinations, requiring two people to cooperate to open the door. Some doors may be configured so that either dial will unlock the door, trading off increased convenience for lessened security.|$|E

2500|$|On February 27, 2009, Warn, who had {{previously}} praised the series in her AfterEllen October 31, 2008 column for the portrayal of the couple's onscreen physical affection, criticized the structure and overall writing of the romance. [...] "...many queer and straight viewers began heading <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> {{when it became clear}} that the kisses and the wedding plans were just new ways to dress up the same old depressing and boring lesbian storylines about sperm donors, custody battles, and sexually confused lesbians," [...] she said.

2500|$|A free-fire zone above [...] was {{proposed}} for the cruisers at a planning meeting aboard Coral Sea.

2500|$|The UH-60 can be {{equipped}} with stub wings {{at the top of}} fuselage to carry fuel tanks or various armaments. The initial stub wing system is called External Stores Support System (ESSS). It has two pylons on each wing to carry two [...] and two [...] tanks in total. The four fuel tanks and associated lines and valves form the external extended range fuel system (ERFS). U.S. Army UH-60s have had their ESSS modified into the crashworthy external fuel system (CEFS) configuration, replacing the older tanks with up to four total [...] crashworthy tanks along with self-sealing fuel lines. The ESSS can also carry [...] of armament such as rockets, missiles and gun pods. The ESSS entered service in 1986. However, {{it was found that the}} four fuel tanks obstruct the field of fire <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> guns; thus, the external tank system (ETS), carrying two fuel tanks on the stub wings, was developed.|$|E

2500|$|The nave arcades have {{octagonal}} piers and are of 14th-century date, {{the south}} aisle being {{earlier than the}} north. The transept may be earlier. However, the windows {{are all in the}} perpendicular style of the 15th century, except those in the south aisle, where the eastern window is modern but the windows in the south wall are 14th century. In the 15th century the roof was raised and the clerestorey built. The old roof line can still be seen on the west wall of the nave. The present roof of the nave and south porch are 15th century, when the chancel was also rebuilt. The chancel roof is modern. The font is Norman, of the 'Aylesbury' late 12th-century type, and presumably came from the earlier church.

2500|$|After {{moving through}} [...] of {{vegetation}} Oddy ordered the patrol {{to set up}} a defensive perimeter so that the signaller could contact Dili again. Responding to the calls for assistance, the 12-man Rapid Response Force in two Black Hawks was dispatched to the position of the contact. The patrol waited 20 minutes before hearing the sound of the Black Hawks. The helicopters circled the battlefield in an attempt to support the forces on the ground, yet with the militia attack faltering they began to withdraw, presenting enticing yet forbidden targets <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>door</b> gunners. The patrol thew a smoke grenade to signal their location with the Black Hawks coming in fast to land. The patrol boarded a single Black Hawk to extract. A six-man RRF had inserted from this Black Hawk providing cover for the patrol to board the Black Hawk waiting until it was airborne before boarding the second Black Hawk joining the rest of the RRF. The helicopters circled back with the helicopter containing the patrol landing {{at the site of the}} contact, which had been observed to be clear of militia. Three members of the patrol were set down in a small clearing nearby, recovering the previously abandoned packs and a number of weapons from the dead bodies with the other Black Hawk hovering providing fire support.|$|E
2500|$|A Midrash {{taught that}} the Levites camped {{on the four}} sides of the Tabernacle in {{accordance}} with their duties.

The Midrash explained that from the south came the dew and rain that bring blessing to the world, and there God placed the Kohathites, who bore the ark that carried the Torah, for as [...] and [...] teach, the rains depend on the observance of the Torah. The Midrash explained that from the north came darkness, and thus the Merarites camped there, as [...] indicates that their service was the carrying of wood ("the boards of the tabernacle, and the bars thereof, and the pillars thereof, and the sockets thereof") which [...] teaches counteract idolatrous influences when it says, [...] "The chastisement of vanities is wood." [...] And the Midrash explained that from the east comes light, and thus Moses, Aaron, and his sons camped there, because they were scholars and men of pious deeds, bringing atonement by their prayer and sacrifices.|$|E
