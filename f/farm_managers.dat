25|$|The first {{action of}} the new {{government}} was the nationalisation of the large majority of private property in Hungary. Despite advice from Lenin and the Bolsheviks, Béla Kun's government chose not to redistribute land to the peasantry, which reduced the majority of their support in Hungary. Instead, all land was to be converted into collective farms and former estate owners, managers and bailiffs were to be retained as the new collective <b>farm</b> <b>managers.</b> This resulted in the dissolution of the balance of power between the old elite and the peasantry which made up the majority of Kun's support.|$|E
25|$|In 1969, Aliyev was {{appointed}} by Leonid Brezhnev to the post of First Secretary of the Central Committee of Azerbaijan Communist Party amidst a Soviet anti-corruption campaign, Aliyev made some progress {{in the fight against}} corruption: a number of people were sentenced to prison terms; and in 1975, five factory and collective <b>farm</b> <b>managers</b> were sentenced to death for gross corruption. In the early 1980s, Aliyev barred the offspring of certain legal personnel from attending the Republic's law school, in a purported effort to curb a self-perpetuating elite based on corruption. In 1977, he visited Iran: Mashhad twice and Kerbala once.|$|E
25|$|Presented {{as having}} sparse and more old {{fashioned}} furnishings, the Old House {{is presented as}} being occupied in the upper story only, consisting of a main room used as the kitchen, bedroom and for washing, with the only other rooms being an adjoining second bedroom and an overhanging toilet. The main bed is an oak box bed dating to 1712, obtained from Star House in Baldersdale in 1962. Originally a defensive house in its own right, the lower level of the Old House is an undercroft, or vaulted basement chamber, with 1.5 metre thick walls - in times of attack the original tenant family would have retreated here with their valuables, although in its later use as the <b>farm</b> <b>managers</b> house, it is now presented as a storage and work room, housing a large wooden cheese press. More children would have slept in the attic of the Old House (not accessible as a display).|$|E

25|$|The Heroninos Archive is {{the name}} given to a huge {{collection}} of papyrus documents, mostly letters, but also including {{a fair number of}} accounts, which come from Roman Egypt in 3rd century AD. The bulk of the documents relate to the running of a large, private estate is named after Heroninos because he was phrontistes (Koine Greek: manager) of the estate which had a complex and standardised system of accounting which was followed by all its local <b>farm</b> <b>managers.</b> Each administrator on each sub-division of the estate drew up his own little accounts, for the day-to-day running of the estate, payment of the workforce, production of crops, the sale of produce, the use of animals, and general expenditure on the staff. This information was then summarized as pieces of papyrus scroll into one big yearly account for each particular sub-division of the estate. Entries were arranged by sector, with cash expenses and gains extrapolated from all the different sectors. Accounts of this kind gave the owner the opportunity to take better economic decisions because the information was purposefully selected and arranged.|$|E

40|$|Before {{setting up}} or {{changing}} a pig farm operation, {{the consequences of}} the farm set up must be explored and changes planned. To calculate technical and economic consequences a <b>farm</b> <b>manager</b> model for pig production systems, the Pig <b>Farm</b> <b>Manager,</b> has been developed. The Pig <b>Farm</b> <b>Manager</b> estimates the effects of various farm designs as well as farm management on production, environmental and economical parameters. The Pig <b>Farm</b> <b>Manager</b> includes simulations for sow farms and finisher pig farms. In the model the user enters farm data on e. g. farm size, housing system or farm management (e. g. feeding strategy), which the model uses to calculate output-parameters. The Pig <b>Farm</b> <b>Manager</b> estimates cost price, profits, gross margins, costs and income per farm, per sow or finisher place. To evaluate the analytical capacities of the model a comparison between a standard sow farm and a high-health-status farm was made. The high-health-farm (HHF) had better growth of piglets, lower mortality rate and better fertility traits for sows compared to a standard farm. However, the HHF had higher investment costs and required more labour. Overall, on the HHF, cost price per piglet was 3. 19 lower and yearly farm income about 21, 000,- higher compared to the standard sow farm. Livestock Production/Industries,...|$|R
