25|$|Most {{charges of}} {{discrimination}} based on price are difficult to verify, without significant documentation. Studies indicate that less than 10% of all {{discrimination based on}} price is actually reported to any authority or regulatory body, and {{much of this is}} through class-action lawsuits. Furthermore, while a number of monitoring services and consumer interest groups take an interest in this form of discrimination, there is very little they can <b>do</b> <b>to</b> <b>change</b> it. Most discrimination based on price occurs in situations without a standardized price list that can be compared against. In the cases of per diem charges, this is easily concealed as few consumers can exchange estimates and work rates, and even if they do the business in question can claim that the services provided had different baseline costs, conditions, etc.|$|E
