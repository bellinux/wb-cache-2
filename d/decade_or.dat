5|$|The first {{principal}} keeper was James Ewing {{who looked}} after the light {{for the next}} eleven years. Despite the exceptionally adverse conditions faced by the keepers, which resulted in them receiving additional payments in kind, Ewing {{was not the only}} one who served the light for a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more. However, some found the lonely rock and its cramped quarters less to their taste. One had to be prevented from diving into the sea and attempting to swim ashore.|$|E
5|$|Sometime between Michaelmas 1178 and {{the start}} of 1179, Reginald retired from public life and became a monk at Lewes Priory, which had been founded by his family. When he retired, the Exchequer began to {{pressure}} him to repay his debts to the king, which for the previous <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more they had ignored. Reginald died in 1179, and his heir was his son William de Warenne. Besides his son, Reginald also had several daughters. One was Gundrada who married three times– first to Peter de Valognes, son of Roger de Valognes, second to William de Courcy, son of William de Courcy and Avice de Rumilly the daughter of William Meschin, and third to Geoffrey Hose, the son of Henry Hose. Another daughter was Alice who married Peter, constable of Mealton. A possible third daughter was Muriel, who was a nun at Carrow Abbey. Another possible daughter was Ela, who married Duncan the Earl of Fife. At his death, Reginald still owed {{a large portion of the}} fine levied against him for the inheritance of his father-in-law's estates.|$|E
5|$|The Sejm, until 1573 {{summoned by}} the king at his {{discretion}} (for example when he needed funds to wage a war), composed of the two chambers presided over by the monarch, became {{in the course of}} the 16th century the main organ of the state power. The reform-minded execution movement had its chance to take on the magnates and the church hierarchy (and take steps to restrain their abuse of power and wealth) when Sigismund Augustus switched sides and lent them his support at the sejm of 1562. During this and several more sessions of parliament, within the next <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so, the Reformation inspired szlachta was able to push through a variety of reforms, which resulted in a fiscally more sound, better governed, more centralized and territorially unified Polish state. Some of the changes were too modest, other had never become completely implemented (e. g. recovery of the usurped Crown land), but nevertheless for the time being the middle szlachta movement was victorious.|$|E

5|$|These {{ships were}} {{designed}} by Sir Edward Reed, the Director of Naval Construction, as replacements for the various gunvessels built for the Crimean War. Being built of green timber, their hulls were starting to rot after a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more in service, but their engines were still generally sound. As the older ships were broken up their engines were salvaged and transferred to Beacon-class ships under construction. Combat experience against Chinese fortifications had shown that the single 32-pounder smoothbore armament of the earlier ships was not powerful enough so Reed was directed to prepare a twin-screw, shallow draft design suitable for riverine operations that incorporated a pair of steam engines from the older gunboats, a heavy armament, and enough freeboard to allow for service at sea. These rather contradictory requirements forced Reed to discard traditional wooden framing for these ships and the Beacon class became the first ships of the Royal Navy to be framed in iron with wooden planking.|$|E
5|$|Though {{the plains}} were once {{assumed to be}} vast, desert-like habitats, {{research}} over the past <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> so shows that they teem {{with a wide variety}} of microbial life. However, ecosystem structure and function at the deep seafloor have historically been very poorly studied because of the size and remoteness of the abyss. Recent oceanographic expeditions conducted by an international group of scientists from the Census of Diversity of Abyssal Marine Life (CeDAMar) have found an extremely high level of biodiversity on abyssal plains, with up to 2000 species of bacteria, 250 species of protozoans, and 500 species of invertebrates (worms, crustaceans and molluscs), typically found at single abyssal sites. New species make up more than 80% of the thousands of seafloor invertebrate species collected at any abyssal station, highlighting our heretofore poor understanding of abyssal diversity and evolution. Richer biodiversity is associated with areas of known phytodetritus input and higher organic carbon flux.|$|E
25|$|Planning, licensing, and {{constructing}} even {{a single}} nuclear plant typically takes a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more, and plants frequently fail to meet completion deadlines. Due to the dearth of orders in recent decades, the world currently has very limited capacity to manufacture many of the critical components of nuclear plants. Rebuilding that capacity will take a <b>decade</b> <b>or</b> more.|$|E
