40|$|Arborists {{frequently}} use handsaws while climbing, and {{a recent}} accident highlighted the danger of cutting one’s rope with a handsaw. There {{do not appear to}} be any robust tests describing the ability of handsaws to cut ropes. The following study attached <b>handsaw</b> <b>blades</b> to a pendulum, which swung into a rope, bringing the blade and rope, which was under tension, into contact. The percent of the rope’s diameter cut by the blade was measured, as well as the percent loss in the rope’s strength after it was cut. Type of blade was a more important factor than type of rope with respect to the percent cut and percent strength loss, and there was a nearly one-to-one relationship between those response variables. The results of this study are discussed in the context of a climber’s safety...|$|E
40|$|Bandsaw blades {{are one of}} {{the most}} {{commonly}} used tools of the wood cutting industry. Their base materials are mostly unalloyed or poorly Cr-alloyed tool steels. After the review of the <b>handsaw</b> <b>blade's</b> cyclic load characteristics, we present the typical failures, which can be, originate in it's cracking. With the use of these information an overall systematization has been set up by the bandsaw blade cracking types and its root causes. The main place of the failure is the weld and the heat-affected zone's area where the welding can failure or the lack of toughness can produce cracking. An other zone, where cracking may appear is the bandsaw blade's tooth gullet because it raises the stress intensity factor. Special material testing methods have been made to investigate the tooth gullet's notch sensitivity from the test results that a comparison of several bandsaw blade base material, are reviewed. With the use of the results a notch sensitivity rating system has been worked out, which can be used to rate different <b>handsaw</b> <b>blade</b> base material's notch sensitivity...|$|R
40|$|The typical too] steels of the wood-cutting {{industry}} are the unalloyed and chromium and nickel containing, low-alloyed eutectoid steels. These materials, in tempered condition {{have a very}} high, 1200 - 1400 MPa tensile strength. One of the major failure forms of these tools is the fatigue fracture of the tool. The high pretension and the cyclic load, caused by the cutting and the bending of the tool, easily can cause high-cycle fatigue fracture, especially at the welded area and at the heat affected zone. Thus, {{one of the most}} critical part in the manufacturing process of the <b>handsaw</b> <b>blade</b> is the welding. We have examined the fatigue properties of three types of joints: conventional and cold wire TIG welding, MIG welding, and resistance-butt welded joints. The structure at the weld and at the heat affected zone could highly affect the life-span of the tool. Therefore the welding parameters (preheat, post welding heat treatment (PWHT), shield gas, backing gas), affecting the microstructure of the weld, also have serious affects on the fatigue properties. The influence of welding parameters on the fatigue properties were examined by low-cycle fatigue test...|$|R
5000|$|Veryday also designs equipment, work {{protection}} and machine constructions for industrial enterprises, aiming to reduce accidents and musculoskeletal injuries. The company {{is known for}} its award winning welding helmet Speedglas, owned by the American company 3M. Ergonomidesign has developed over 400 different products for Bahco, for example the recently released <b>handsaw</b> with exchangeable <b>blades</b> that won a Red Dot Design Award and an IF iF product design award 2009. Another example is the working gloves [...] "Tegera Pro Vibration Control" [...] for Ejendals. They received the Red Dot Award [...] "Best of the Best" [...] in 2007 and IDEA, International Design Excellence Award Gold Award in 2009.|$|R
