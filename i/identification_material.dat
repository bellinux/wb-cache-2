It also allows increasing photoconductor active area without a considerable increase in the capacitive loading to the antenna, boosting the maximum terahertz radiation power by preventing the carrier screening effect and thermal breakdown at high optical pump powers.

40|$|Time-domain {{terahertz}} {{imaging and}} spectroscopy systems have unique functionalities for chemical <b>identification,</b> <b>material</b> characterization, biological sensing, medical imaging, and security screening. Photoconductive sources and detectors {{are commonly used}} for the generation and detection of terahertz pulses in compact time-domain terahertz systems operating at room temperature. However, the low radiation power of conventional photoconductive sources and the low responsivity of conventional photoconductive detectors have limited {{the scope of the}} potential uses of these systems. To improve the performance of time-domain terahertz systems, photoconductive sources and detectors consisting of large-area plasmonic nanoantenna arrays are designed, fabricated and experimentally characterized. To increase the radiation power of photoconductive sources, the plasmonic nanoantenna arrays are designed to enhance the absorption of optical pump photons near them. The enhanced optical absorption leads to stronger ultrafast photocurrent levels coupled to the nanoantenna arrays. The nanoantenna arrays are designed to serve as broadband terahertz radiating elements. Hence, high-power and broadband pulsed terahertz radiation is generated. Higher terahertz radiation powers and device efficiencies are achieved by a tighter optical pump confinement enabled by plasmonic nanocavities formed near the plasmonic nanoantenna arrays. Record-high terahertz radiation powers as high as 4 mW are achieved over a 0. 1 – 5 THz frequency range. To increase the responsivity of photoconductive detectors, the plasmonic nanoantenna arrays are designed to maximize the interaction between the optical pump photons and the incident terahertz radiation at the nanoscale. The impact of the nanoantenna geometry on terahertz detection responsivity and bandwidth is analyzed theoretically and experimentally. By optimizing the geometry of the nanoantenna arrays, broadband time-domain terahertz spectroscopy with a record-high dynamic range of 107 dB is demonstrated...|$|E
40|$|Terahertz {{technology}} has attracted extensive attention {{because of its}} unique applications in environmental monitoring, space explorations, chemical <b>identification,</b> <b>material</b> characterization, security screening, medical imaging, and biological sensing. In the meantime, the practical feasibility of many terahertz systems is still limited by the low power, low efficiency, and bulky nature of existing terahertz sources. Among various techniques for terahertz generation, photoconduction has demonstrated very promising performance for generating both pulsed and continuous-wave (CW) terahertz radiation. Compared to other optically driven terahertz emitters based on nonlinear optical processes, performance of photoconductive terahertz emitters is not constrained by the Manley–Rowe limit and, therefore, can offer significantly higher optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiencies. In spite of their great promise, the performance of existing photoconductive terahertz emitters is severely limited by poor quantum efficiency of ultrafast photoconductors. This limitation is mainly caused by inefficient collection {{of the majority of}} the photocarriers in a sub-picosecond time scale. To address this limitation, we introduce novel photoconductive terahertz source designs that incorporate plasmonic contact electrodes to offer significantly higher efficiencies compared to conventional designs. By utilizing plasmonic contact electrodes, a large portion of the incident optical pump beam is concentrated and absorbed in close proximity to the plasmonic contact electrodes. Therefore, the average transport path length of photo-generated carriers to the contact electrodes is greatly reduced. As a result, higher photocurrent levels are fed to the terahertz antenna within the oscillation cycle of the terahertz radiation and higher optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiencies are achieved. We demonstrate record-high optical-to-terahertz conversion efficiencies as high as 7. 5 %, exhibiting three orders of magnitude higher efficiencies compared to conventional designs. We also demonstrate CW terahertz generation with a radiation frequency tuning range of more than 2 THz and a radiation power of 17 μW at 1 THz, exhibiting a 3 -fold higher radiation power level compared to the state-of-the art. Moreover, we demonstrate an integrated photoconductive terahertz source with compact optical pump sources, which offers a very promising solution for future high-performance and compact terahertz imaging and sensing systems...|$|E

Aerial parts were collected from three localities from Eastern Algeria (Beni Aziz, Boutaleb and Amouchas). The air-dried aerial parts were subjected to hydro-distillation using a Clevenger-type apparatus. The analysis and identification of the essential oil components of Teucrium polium, was performed using the GC-MS. The disk diffusion method is utilised for determination of the antibacterial activity. Results: The average yield of essential oil of the samples is 0. 37 %. These analyses led to the identification of 57 components. The chemical composition of the essential oil of T. polium {{is dominated by the}} presence of a major product, α-pinene (14. 1 - 18 %), β-pinene (15. 3 - 18. 1 %), germacrene-D (3. 8 - 19 %), myrcene (8. 2 - 10. 4 %), limonene (5. 3 - 8. 7 %), sabinene (2. 7 - 4. 3 %), caryophyllene-(E) (1. 8 - 2. 3 %) and spathulenol (1 - 2. 9 %). The essential oil of the Beni Aziz population has a high antibacterial activity against Escherichia coli, Staphylococcus aureus and the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae. The population of Boutaleb has significant activity against Bacillus cereus and no action against S. aureus and the yeast S. cerevisiae. Conclusion: The observed differences and variability of the essential oil of T. polium of Algeria are likely due to different environmental and genetic factors. The number of components is different in these three populations of T. polium from eastern Algeria. Our investigation allows us to support the presence of several chemotypes in T. polium. The chemotype to germacrene-D is located in the regions of Amouchas and Boutaleb. Beni Aziz is the region that has favoured the development of Δ-elemene chemotype. The results of this work show that the essential oil of T. polium possesses antimicrobial properties, which can be used as natural antimicrobial agents...|$|E

40|$|BACKGROUND: The aim of {{the paper}} was to compare radiographs and MRI in {{assessment}} of active and chronic inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joints in patients with chronic back pain and suspected axial spondyloarthritis. Moreover, {{the aim was to}} determine which of the two methods is more accurate in diagnosing individual inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joints and whether there is a correlation between radiographs and MRI in their <b>identification.</b> <b>MATERIAL</b> AND METHODS: The analysis was conducted in a group of 101 patients, including 61 women and 40 men, referred to radiographs and MR examinations by rheumatologists due to chronic back pain. AP images of the lumbar region of the spine were performed in each patient in the supine position. The images included the sacroiliac joints. Changes in the SIJs were assessed based on the New York criteria of 1966. In MR examination, the SIJs were assessed in terms of the presence of active and chronic inflammatory changes described by the ASAS. The statistical analysis of the variables tested was conducted in the Excel and Statistica systems. RESULTS: In relation to the final clinical diagnosis of axSpA, MRI had higher sensitivity and specificity than radiography in diagnosing sacroiliitis (sensitivity: 71 % vs. 22 %, specificity: 90 % vs. 94 % on radiographs according to New York criteria. In relation to MRI, radiographs resulted in 40 % of incorrect sacroiliitis diagnoses (both false positive and false negative results). In as many as 50 % of cases (7 / 14), MRI failed to confirm the presence of inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joints observed in radiography according to the modNY criteria (false positive results on radiographs). Both examinations are characterised by very low agreement, which is near to random, in assessing individual features of sacroiliitis, such as sclerosis, change in the joint space width, erosions and ankylosis. CONCLUSIONS: 1. Radiographs do not allow early inflammatory lesions indicating sacroiliitis to be diagnosed, which leads to diagnostic delay. MRI is the method of choice in diagnosing early sacroiliitis and detecting structural lesions, in particular sclerosis and erosions. 2. Radiographs and MRI are characterised by low, near to random, agreement in the detectability of the individual inflammatory changes in the sacroiliac joints...|$|E
40|$|The {{non-destructive}} {{measurement of}} deflection basins {{has come a}} long way from measuring only maximum deflection or radius of curvature and using empirical relationships in rehabilitation design. New equipment was developed world-wide and analysis techniques moved towards utilising the full deflection basin in fundamental analysis procedures. This author addressed the problem of a proper description of the full deflection basin by doing a detailed literature survey on this subject. Various deflection basin parameters that describe the deflection basin are listed, as well as the various measuring apparatus related to them. The apparatus are all discussed in detail and related to the equipment available in South Africa. The measurement of deflection basins with the road surface deflectometer (RSD) under accelerated testing with the fleet of heavy vehicle simulators (HVSs) are described in detail. An improved data manipulation procedure is proposed which simplifies the calculation of all the deflection basin parameters found in literature. Various models to fit the measured deflection basins are also investigated in an effort to describe the deflection basin in full too. The measured deflection basin parameters of a bitumen, granular, cemented and light structured granular base pavement are discussed in detail as being tested with the fleet of HVS's. It is shown how the deflection basin parameters reflect the structural capacity of the various layers and behaviour states. A more accurate description of the behaviour states is made possible with the proposal of ranges for the various behaviour states for these deflection basins selected. A literature study was carried out to investigate the various analysis procedures that use measured deflection basins as basic input in the characterization of materials. On the basis of this study, linear elastic programmes were used to calculate effective elastic moduli for each pavement layer, using measured deflection basins as input. The possibility to relate typical distress determinants to measured deflection basins were investigated in the literature. Based on this, typical South African flexible pavement structures were analysed mechanistically and typical design curves were established for typical bitumen and. granular base pavements. The effect of overlays were investigated too, resulting in typical overlay design curves. In the final chapter the author endeavours to summarise the research by indicating how deflection basins can be measured and enhance the South African mechanistic rehabilitation design process. Only the latter rehabilitation design procedure is discussed with specific reference to the enhancement of the behaviour state <b>identification,</b> <b>material</b> characterization, analysis procedure and rehabilitation design with measured deflection basin parameters.
