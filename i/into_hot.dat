5|$|In ancient Persia, saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') was {{cultivated}} at Derbena and Isfahan in the 10th century BC. There, Persian saffron threads {{have been}} found interwoven into ancient Persian royal carpets and funeral shrouds. Saffron was used by ancient Persian worshippers as a ritual offering to their deities, and as a brilliant yellow dye, perfume, and a medicine. Thus, saffron threads would be scattered across beds and mixed <b>into</b> <b>hot</b> teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Indeed, Persian saffron threads, used to spice foods and teas, were widely suspected by foreigners of being a drugging agent and an aphrodisiac. These fears grew to forewarn travelers to abstain from eating saffron-laced Persian cuisine. In addition, Persian saffron was dissolved in water with sandalwood {{to use as a}} body wash after heavy work and perspiration under the hot Persian sun. Later, Persian saffron was heavily used by Alexander the Great and his forces during their Asian campaigns. They mixed saffron into teas and dined on saffron rice. Alexander personally used saffron sprinkled in warm bath water, taking after Cyrus the Great. Much like Cyrus, he believed it would heal his many wounds, and his faith in saffron grew with each treatment. He even recommended saffron baths for the ordinary men under him. The Greek soldiers, taken with saffron's perceived curative properties, continued the practice after they returned to Macedonia.|$|E

25|$|Saffron was {{detailed}} in a 7th-century BC Assyrian botanical reference compiled under Ashurbanipal. Documentation of saffron's use over {{the span of}} 3,500 years has been uncovered. Saffron-based pigments have indeed been found in 50,000-year-old depictions of prehistoric places in northwest Iran. The Sumerians later used wild-growing saffron in their remedies and magical potions. Saffron was an article of long-distance trade before the Minoan palace culture's 2nd millennium BC peak. Ancient Persians cultivated Persian saffron (Crocus sativus 'Hausknechtii') in Derbena, Isfahan, and Khorasan by the 10th century BC. At such sites, saffron threads were woven into textiles, ritually offered to divinities, and used in dyes, perfumes, medicines, and body washes. Saffron threads would thus be scattered across beds and mixed <b>into</b> <b>hot</b> teas as a curative for bouts of melancholy. Non-Persians also feared the Persians' usage of saffron as a drugging agent and aphrodisiac. During his Asian campaigns, Alexander the Great used Persian saffron in his infusions, rice, and baths as a curative for battle wounds. Alexander's troops imitated the practice from the Persians and brought saffron-bathing to Greece.|$|E
25|$|The various geyser basins {{are located}} where {{rainwater}} and snowmelt can percolate into the ground, get indirectly superheated by the underlying Yellowstone hotspot, and then erupt {{at the surface}} as geysers, hot springs, and fumaroles. Thus flat-bottomed valleys between ancient lava flows and glacial moraines are {{where most of the}} large geothermal areas are located. Smaller geothermal areas can be found where fault lines reach the surface, in places along the circular fracture zone around the caldera, and at the base of slopes that collect excess groundwater. Due to the Yellowstone Plateau's high elevation the average boiling temperature at Yellowstone's geyser basins is 199°F (93°C). When properly confined and close to the surface it can periodically release some of the built-up pressure in eruptions of hot water and steam that can reach up to 390 feet (120 m) into the air (see Steamboat Geyser, the world’s tallest geyser). Water erupting from Yellowstone's geysers is superheated above that boiling point to an average of 204°F (95.5°C) as it leaves the vent. The water cools significantly while airborne and is no longer scalding hot by the time it strikes the ground, nearby boardwalks, or even spectators. Because of the high temperatures of the water in the features it is important that spectators remain on the boardwalks and designated trails. Several deaths have occurred in the park as a result of falls <b>into</b> <b>hot</b> springs.|$|E

D'Este wrote the same, although Bucknall had defended his decision claiming [...] "49 ... no recent battle experience and it was important to launch them nicely into their first fighting in a properly coordinated battle, and not bundle them helter-skelter <b>into</b> <b>hot</b> armoured scrapping like that around V-B and Amaye". Buckley wrote that the operation was a failure of command. Terry Copp wrote that Dempsey continued to underestimate the German defence of ground and Mungo Melvin wrote that Dempsey and the Second Army handled subordinate formations poorly, by not giving subordinates definite tasks, clear intentions and allowing discretion in the implementation of orders.|$|E
500|$|In 2003, Ramirez again posted strong {{offensive}} numbers, {{finishing with}} a [...]325 average, 37 home runs, and 104 RBI. The second half surge of newly acquired fellow Dominican slugger David Ortiz gave the Red Sox a formidable one-two {{punch in the}} middle of the lineup with Ramirez. However, in the summer, Ramirez missed several games with pharyngitis, but got <b>into</b> <b>hot</b> water as he was spotted in a bar in the hotel where he lived with a close friend, Yankees infielder Enrique Wilson, despite being supposedly too ill to play in the series against the rival Yankees. Ramirez and Wilson both maintained that Manny was just talking to his friend in that setting, and not actually drinking or partying as the media speculated. Boston manager Grady Little benched Ramirez for one game as a result. Despite this distraction, the Red Sox finished the season 95-67, qualifying for the MLB postseason for the first time with Ramirez. In the decisive fifth game of their Division Series matchup against the Oakland Athletics, Ramirez broke a 6th inning 1-1 tie by launching a go-ahead three-run homer off Barry Zito that set up an ALCS showdown with the rival Yankees. In ALCS Game 3, Ramirez was at the center of a bench-clearing brawl. Early in the game, Red Sox pitcher Pedro Martínez had hit Yankees outfielder Karim Garcia up high with a pitch, sparking heated dialogue, and a hard slide by Garcia into Red Sox second baseman Todd Walker had exacerbated the tensions. The very next inning, Yankees pitcher Roger Clemens threw a pitch high and inside to Ramirez, and Manny charged the mound, sparking the melee. The Red Sox lost the game 4-3. Despite Ramirez's strong play in the ALCS against the Yankees (.310 with 2 home runs), the Red Sox fell to the Yankees in the decisive seventh game on Aaron Boone's infamous extra-inning, walk-off home run.|$|E
