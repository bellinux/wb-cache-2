40|$|Abstract: Previews {{studies on}} the effect of loading rate on the micro and nano <b>indentation</b> <b>{{hardness}}</b> showed that both of them affect hardness measurements. Such effect has been included in micro and nano hardness measurements. ISO/FDIS 14577 - 1 standard determine the loading rate of the indenter for micro hardness showed not exceed 2 μm/sec and for nano hardness should be less then 10 nm/sec. The present study is a trial to reveal the effect of both loading rate and duration time on the macro <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> applied on standard hardness test blocks. A modern Zwick <b>hardness</b> <b>tester</b> that could vary loading rates and duration time over a broad range was used to preform this study.

Disk-shaped specimens (n= 24 per shade) were fabricated using a 3 -mm-thick increment of composite resin (Z 100).

In this report, we deposited a composite CrTiSiN hard coating, and a traditional single-layered TiAlN coating as a reference. Then, the coatings were comparatively studied by a series of tests.

A self-designed compression and friction tester, by combining a Universal Testing Machine and a wear tester, was used to evaluate the contact behavior of composite CrTiSiN coated dies in compressing of Mg alloy sheets under high pressure. The results indicated that the hardness of composite CrTiSiN coating was lower than that of the TiAlN coating. However, the CrTiSiN coating showed better anti-wear performance.

The indentation tests were performed with peak loads ranging from 5 to 400 mN in order to investigate the property variation with the variation of the peak load and material microstructure. The values of <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> and Young’s modulus were calculated according to the models developed by Oliver and Pharr (O&P) and by Cheng and Cheng (C&C).

The derivation {{is based on}} a strain gradient plasticity solution for an internally pressurized thick-walled spherical shell of an elastic power-law hardening material. Closed-form formulas are provided for both conical and spherical indentations. The indentation radius enters these formulas with its own dimensional identity, unlike that in classical plasticity based ECMs where indentation geometrical parameters appear only in non-dimensional forms. As a result, the newly developed ECM can capture the indentation size effect. The formulas explicitly show that <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> depends on Young’s modulus, yield stress, strain-hardening exponent and strain gradient coefficient of the indented material {{as well as on the}} geometry of the indenter. The new model reduces to existing classical plasticity based ECMs (including Johnson’s ECM for elastic–perfectly plastic materials) when the strain gradient effect is not considered. The numerical results obtained using the newly developed model reveal that the <b>hardness</b> is indeed <b>indentation</b> size dependent when the indentation radius is very small: the smaller the indentation, the larger the <b>hardness.</b> Also, the <b>indentation</b> <b>hardness</b> is seen to increase with the Young’s modulus and strain-hardening level of the indented material for both conical and spherical indentations. The strain-hardening effect on the hardness is observed to be significant for materials having strong strain-hardening characteristics.
