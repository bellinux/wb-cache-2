50|$|A rotor/Flettner ship {{is a type}} of ship {{designed}} to use the Magnus effect for propulsion. The Magnus effect is a force acting on a spinning body in a moving airstream, which acts perpendicularly to the direction of the airstream. Rotor ships typically use rotor sails — spinning bodies that are essentially vertical cylinders — powered by a motor {{to take advantage of the}} effect. These types of propulsion cylinders are now commonly called <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotors.</b> Rotor ships have unique points of sail.|$|R
5000|$|In 1938 Flettner, {{together}} with Kurt Hohenemser, built the Flettner Fl 265. [...] The Flettner Fl 265 addressed the probable of torque compensation {{as the first}} helicopter with counter-rotating <b>rotors</b> (<b>Flettner</b> double <b>rotor).</b>|$|R
5000|$|In 2009 the Finland-based {{maritime}} engineering company Wärtsilä unveiled a concept for a cruiseferry that would utilise <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotors</b> as means of reducing fuel consumption.

50|$|The E-Ship 1 was {{equipped}} with nine Mitsubishi marine diesel engines with a total output of 3.5 MW. The ship's exhaust gas boilers are connected to a Siemens downstream steam turbine, which in turn drives four Enercon-developed <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotors.</b> These rotors, resembling four large cylinders mounted on the ship's deck, are 27 meters tall and 4 meters in diameter. Due to technical problems the Mitsubishi diesel generators {{have been replaced by}} Caterpillar diesel generators in 2013. The new Caterpillar generators generate a total power of 6,3MW.|$|R
50|$|A <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotor</b> is {{a smooth}} {{cylinder}} with disc end plates which is spun along its long axis and, as air passes {{at right angles}} across it, the Magnus effect causes an aerodynamic force to be generated in the third dimension.|$|E
50|$|Flettner {{revolutionized}} {{the art of}} harnessing the wind, used essentially in an unaltered form for thousands of years—the canvas sail—by a modern machine—the <b>Flettner</b> <b>Rotor</b> ship—that could permit ocean liners to reduce their crews by two-thirds and save 90 percent in fuel.|$|E

50|$|The E-Ship 1 is a RoLo {{cargo ship}} that {{made its first}} voyage with cargo in August 2010. The ship {{is owned by the}} third-largest wind turbine manufacturer, Germany's Enercon GmbH. It is used to {{transport}} wind turbine components. The E-Ship 1 is a Flettner ship: four large rotorsails that rise from its deck are rotated via a mechanical linkage to the ship's propellers. The sails, or <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotors,</b> aid the ship's propulsion by means of the Magnus effect - the perpendicular force that is exerted on a spinning body moving through a fluid stream.|$|R

50|$|After Norsepower's {{success with}} the new design, also Viking Line {{returned}} with the rotor concept for their next planned newbuilding. The first image of a new 63,000 GT vessel shows large <b>flettner</b> <b>rotors</b> which could help the ship {{to reduce fuel consumption}} with up to 15%. Letter of intent was signed for the ship in November 2016, awaiting final agreements signing in early 2017. According to a Finnish newspaper, the rotor concept of Viking Line is based on Norsepower Rotor Sails. The latest news from Norsepower is that they have agreed with world's biggest shipping company, Maersk, to start testing the rotor concept in Maersk ships starting beginning of 2018. The managing director of Norsepower, Tuomas Riski, promises their innovation to cut 7-10% of fuel cost leading up to 300000€ savings in big tankers.|$|R
50|$|A {{flettner}} airplane {{is a type}} of rotor airplane {{which uses}} a <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotor</b> to provide lift. The rotor comprises a spinning cylinder with circular end plates and, in an aircraft, spins about a spanwise horizontal axis. When the aircraft moves forward the Magnus effect creates lift.|$|E
50|$|The third design {{considered}} is the <b>Flettner</b> <b>Rotor.</b> This {{is a large}} cylinder mounted {{upright on}} a ship's deck and mechanically spun. The effect of this spinning area {{in contact with the}} wind flowing around it creates a thrust effect that is used to propel the ship. Flettner Rotors were invented in the 1920s and have seen limited use since then. In 2010 a 10,000 dwt cargo ship was equipped with four Flettner Rotors to evaluate their role in increasing fuel efficiency. The only parameter of the <b>Flettner</b> <b>Rotor</b> requiring control is the speed of the rotor's rotation, so this method of wind propulsion requires very little operator input. In comparison to kite sails, Flettner rotors offer very similar efficiency gains {{depending on the size of}} sail used vs. size of the rotor.|$|E
50|$|A <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotor</b> mounted {{beneath the}} {{waterline}} of a ship's hull and emerging laterally will act {{to stabilize the}} ship in heavy seas. By controlling the direction and speed of rotation, strong lift or downforce can be generated. The largest deployment of the system to date is in the motor yacht Eclipse.|$|E

50|$|In 1947 Anton Flettner, a German aero-engineer, {{was brought}} to the United States as part of Operation Paperclip. He was the {{developer}} of the two earlier synchropter designs from Germany during World War II: the Flettner Fl 265 which pioneered the synchropter layout, and the slightly later Flettner Fl 282 Kolibri ("Hummingbird"), intended for eventual production. Both designs used the principle of counter-rotating side-by-side intermeshing rotors, as the means {{to solve the problem of}} torque compensation, normally countered in single-rotor helicopters by a tail rotor, fenestron, NOTAR, or vented blower exhaust.

40|$|<b>Flettner</b> <b>Rotors</b> (FR) are {{spinning}} cylinders, {{which produce}} fluid dynamic lift {{by using the}} Magnus Effect. The Magnus force can be much greater in magnitude than the wing lifting force, given the same projected area and dynamic air pressure. The FR was used for ship’s propulsion system in the 1920 ’s. Nowadays, the FR is being seriously examined due to the necessity of renewable resources use. Since several months, the Dipartimento di Ingegneria Industriale of the Università degli Studi di Napoli “Federico II” has started a research about preliminary analysis for marine application of FR through Unsteady Reynolds Average Navier Stokes (U-RANS) simulations for 3 D flow past a full-scale rotating [1]. The aerodynamic forces, Lift (L), Drag (D) and Aerodynamic Efficiency (L/D) of a FR are the response variables and {{are influenced by the}} following control factors: - Spin Ratio (SR), i. e. the ratio of circumferential-cylinder-velocity-to-free stream-velocity; - Aspect Ratio (AR), i. e. the ratio between the cylinder length and diameter; - Endplate Ratio (De/D 0), i. e. ratio between the endplates diameter and cylinder diameter; In this work, a preliminary assessment of numerical setup has been conducted by comparison with experimental investigation carried out by Badalamenti and Prince at City University of London and published in [2], [3]. The tested cylinder has AR = 5. 1, D 0 = 0. 0889 m, De/D 0 = 2. A statistical approach based on Design of Experiment (DoE) has been applied to the testing program of FR in order to evaluate the functional relationship and the interaction between the control factors SR, AR and De/D 0 which influence the response variables L, D and L/D. All tests are developed through U-RANS simulations for 3 D flow past rotating cylinder.

5000|$|Work on {{delivery}} {{systems for the}} U.S. bioweapons arsenal led to the first mass-produced biological weapon in 1952, the M33 cluster bomb. The M33's sub-munition, the pipe-bomb-like cylindrical M114 bomb, was also completed and battle-ready by 1952. Other delivery systems researched and at least partially developed during the 1950s included the E77 balloon bomb and the E86 cluster bomb. The peak of U.S. biological weapons delivery system development came during the 1960s. Production of cluster bomb submunitions began to shift from cylindrical to spherical bomblets, which had a larger coverage area. Development of the spherical E120 bomblet {{took place in the}} early 1960s as did development of the M143 bomblet, similar to the chemical M139 bomblet. The experimental <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotor</b> bomblet was also developed during this time period.

40|$|Increasing {{focus on}} {{reduction}} of CO 2 emissions, {{and the possibility}} of future severe shortage of oil have sparked renewed interest in wind as supplementary propulsion of merchant ships. Several alternative solutions are considered, like kites, conventional soft sails, rigid sails, <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotors,</b> and wind turbines. A tempting aspect of wind turbine propulsion is that it can provide propulsive force when sailing directly upwind, something that is impossible with the other mentioned forms of wind-assisted propulsion. A method based on axial momentum theory has been outlined, in order to predict the steady-state speed of a wind turbine powered boat. This method is applied to a notional wind turbine powered catamaran. The predicted boat speed to wind speed ratio when the boat is sailing upwind is in good agreement with results from testing of a similar, but smaller, full-scale wind turbine boat. A related topic to wind turbine propulsion is the reversed configuration, where a water turbine is driving an air propeller. This configuration allows for the theoretical possibility of sailing faster than the wind, directly downwind. Based on a similar approach to the method of velocity prediction of wind turbine powered boats, design criteria with respect to water turbine efficiency and hydrofoil chord length, are set for a given hydrofoil boat in order to sail faster than the wind, directly downwind. The design of optimal wind turbine blades for wind turbine powered vessels is studied. A 326 m L WL VLCC is equipped with a Vestas V 90 wind turbine for auxiliary propulsion, and set to sail a route across the North Sea. By employing the wind turbine, 3. 6 % of the fuel is saved when the ship is sailing at 15 kn. If the ship speed is reduced to 10 kn, the fuel saving increases to 21. 1 %. The optimal blade design theory is applied to the wind turbine ship, keeping the wind turbine diameter fixed at 90 m. The optimal blade design increases the fuel saving by a few percentage points. The main drawbacks for a wind turbine powered ship are shown to be the low ship speed to wind speed ratio in order for wind turbine propulsion to be the preferred form of wind-assisted propulsion, as well as the height of such a ship. Attached is a CD-ROM containing Matlab files used for creating various of the results in this thesis, as well as an electronic version of the thesis. </p...|$|R
40|$|International {{shipping}} transports around 90 percent of global commerce and is of major {{importance for the}} global economy. Whilst {{it is the most}} efficient and environmentally friendly mode of transport, CO 2 emissions from shipping activities still account for an estimated three percent of global emissions. As a consequence, the International Maritime Organization (IMO) has recently introduced mandatory measures to reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions from shipping, making emission cuts not only a normative, but also a legal requirement. One means of significantly reducing fuel consumption and thereby GHG emissions from shipping are wind propulsion technologies (i. e. towing kites, <b>Flettner</b> <b>rotors</b> and sails) - yet current market uptake is very low. Therefore, the aim of this research was to identify the possibilities of the IMO as the main regulatory body in international shipping to promote the uptake of wind propulsion technologies. To this end, the theoretical approach of technological innovation systems was adopted. This approach combines structural system components with so-called system functions which represent the dynamics underlying structural changes in the system. The fulfillment of these functions is considered important for the development and diffusion of innovations. First, the level of function fulfillment was evaluated, followed by the identification of structural drivers and barriers influencing function fulfillment. Third, the IMO’s governing capacities were analyzed, enabling the formulation of policy recommendations tailored to the IMO. Data was collected from newspaper articles, company websites and an expert survey (step 1), 14 semi-structured interviews (step 2), and the review of scientific articles (step 3). Across all three wind propulsion technologies, function fulfillment was found to be low or medium, at best, which inhibits further technological development and diffusion. Several structural barriers exist, including, amongst others, a lack of policies and incentive schemes promoting wind propulsion, lack of financial resources, insufficient collaboration among different actor groups and conservative and risk-averse attitudes prevalent in the maritime industry. The number and severity of the structural barriers outweigh those of the mostly emerging structural drivers. Next, it could be asserted that in order to promote technological development and diffusion, policy interventions should focus on stimulating the development and diffusion of knowledge and help mobilize resources. Yet, even though the IMO is well-suited to facilitate knowledge development and diffusion, which it could achieve by establishing a working or correspondence group on wind propulsion, it is less suited to mobilize resources. Nonetheless, it is suggested that the IMO intensifies efforts in relation to the introduction of market-based mechanisms (MBMs), as they increase the economic viability of wind propulsion and can provide funds to be used for research and development activities on low-carbon propulsion technologies. Until the introduction of MBMs, the IMO could set up a temporary fund for the same purpose, with financial contributions from international donor organizations, national governments and industry parties...|$|R
