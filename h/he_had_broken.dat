He could not move the hand well enough to catch high shots and compensated by using the rest of his body. The operation was successful.|$|E
5|$|Bayliss's counsel, Rufus Isaacs, called Starling as {{his first}} witness. Starling {{admitted}} that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> the law by using the dog twice, but {{said that he had}} done so to avoid sacrificing two dogs. Bayliss testified that the dog had been given one-and-a-half grains of morphia earlier in the day, then six ounces of alcohol, chloroform and ether, delivered from an ante room to a tube connected to the dog's trachea. Bayliss said the tubes were fragile, and that had the dog been struggling they would have broken.|$|E

5|$|Feit {{initially}} denied hearing Garza's confession in the rectory, but {{he later}} {{admitted to having}} done so. He accounted for his absence from the sanctuary by explaining that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> his glasses that night; {{he said that he}} often played with his glasses nervously as he listened to confession. Feit said that he had driven back to the pastoral house to get another pair of glasses, and when he arrived he had no key, so he had to climb into the house on the second floor. He said that he sustained the scratches on his hands as was climbing the outside of the brick structure.|$|E
5|$|For this campaign, Robertson {{was made}} a Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE), but later that month he was hospitalised for varicose veins in the leg <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> in 1917. He was {{replaced}} as commander of the 19th Infantry Brigade by Alan Vasey. When Robertson recovered he was given responsibility for the training of AIF reinforcements in the Middle East. Robertson's service {{in the field and}} his long experience in training troops made him an ideal candidate for the post. For his services, Robertson was mentioned in despatches a third time.|$|E
5|$|As {{a result}} of Mugford's {{statement}} Bamber was arrested on 8 September 1985, as was the friend Mugford said he had implicated, although the latter had a solid alibi and was released. Bamber told police Mugford was lying because he had jilted her. He said he loved his parents and sister, and denied that they had kept him short of money; he said the only reason <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> into the caravan site with Mugford was to prove that security was poor. He said he had occasionally gained entry to the farmhouse through a downstairs windows, and had used a knife to move the catches from the outside. He also said he had seen his parents' wills, {{and that they had}} left the estate to be shared between him and Sheila. As for the rifle, he told police the gun was used mostly with the silencer off because it would otherwise not fit in its case.|$|E

5|$|Following his injury, Johnson {{never really}} rediscovered his old form, scoring just 11 goals in 47 {{appearances}} from March 2004 to March 2005, when, after a falling-out with manager Gary Megson, {{he was sent}} on loan to Sheffield United, ironically the club against whom <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> his leg in the first place. Following Nottingham Forest's relegation to League One {{at the end of}} the season, Megson placed Johnson on the transfer list as part of a dramatic overhaul of the club's playing staff. However, the summer of 2005 saw Johnson recalled to the Nottingham Forest first team, and by the start of the 2005–06 season, he had admitted his desire to remain with the club and fight for a place in the team.|$|E
5|$|It is {{difficult}} to assess how Cranmer's theological views had evolved since his Cambridge days. There is evidence that he continued to support humanism; he renewed Erasmus' pension {{that had previously been}} granted by Archbishop Warham. In June 1533, he was confronted with the difficult task of not only disciplining a reformer, but also seeing him burnt at the stake. John Frith was condemned to death for his views on the eucharist: he denied the real presence. Cranmer personally tried to persuade him to change his views without success. Although he rejected Frith's radicalism, by 1534 he clearly signalled that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> with Rome and that he had set a new theological course. He supported the cause of reform by gradually replacing the old guard in his ecclesiastical province with men who followed the new thinking such as Hugh Latimer. He intervened in religious disputes, supporting reformers to the disappointment of religious conservatives who desired to maintain the link with Rome.|$|E
5|$|Nevill and June adopted Bamber {{when he was}} {{six months}} old. They sent him to St Nicholas Primary and the private Maldon Court prep school, along with Sheila, {{followed}} by Gresham's School, a boarding school in Holt, Norfolk, which he attended from September 1970. He was miserable there, not least because of bullying and a sexual assault. He left Gresham's with no qualifications, but attended sixth-form college and in 1978 passed seven O-levels. Nevill paid for him to visit Australia, where Bamber took a scuba-diving course, then New Zealand. Former friends alleged that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> into a jeweller's shop while in New Zealand and had stolen an expensive watch. He had also boasted, they said, {{of being involved in}} smuggling heroin.|$|E

5|$|The {{race was}} {{restarted}} on lap 26, {{and on the}} approach to the hairpin later in the lap Robert Kubica hit the back of Jarno Trulli's Toyota. The impact forced Kubica onto the grass {{at the edge of}} the track, where a bump launched his car into and along the concrete wall just before the hairpin. After losing three wheels, the nose and suffering major damage to the sidepods in the initial impact, the BMW flipped back across the track and came to rest against the barrier in the run-off area on the other side of the track. Although initial reports said that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> his leg, Kubica only suffered a sprained ankle and concussion. The safety car was deployed again after this crash. The safety car was also deployed on lap 50, due to debris from a crash involving Christijan Albers on the previous lap, and on lap 55 due to Vitantonio Liuzzi crashing into the wall of champions once again.|$|E
5|$|A boat draws up on {{the beach}} bearing the veiled figure of Leila, the virgin priestess whose prayers are {{required}} {{to ensure the safety of}} the fishermen. Although neither of them recognises her, she is the woman from Kandy with whom Nadir and Zurga had been in love. As Zurga is explaining her duties, she recognises Nadir, but she says nothing and shortly afterwards is led up to the temple by the high priest Nourabad. Zurga and the fishermen go down to the sea, leaving Nadir alone. In a troubled soliloquy before he sleeps he recalls how, in Kandy, <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> his vows to Zurga and pursued his love for the veiled woman (""). It was the rumour that she might be found in this place that brought him here. Alone in the temple, Leila prays and sings. Nadir wakes and, recognising the voice of his long-desired lover, traces it to the temple. Leila briefly draws her veil aside, he sees it is she and the pair declare their renewed passion. On the beach, the fishermen plead with her to continue protecting them, but she tells Nadir she will sing for him alone ("").|$|E
5|$|By mid-June, III./JG52 {{was back}} {{together}} in Bucharest and re-equipped with the new, more powerful Bf109F-4 model. The Gruppe {{was not involved}} in most of the fighting in the opening phases of Operation Barbarossa as it was once again kept back to defend Ploiești and the Romanian ports from Soviet bombers. The pilots’ mood was not helped when Reichsmarschall Hermann Göring, the commander-in-chief of the Luftwaffe, criticised the unit on 4 July for its lack of success compared to virtually all the other Jagdgruppen. On 1 August, after German advances had removed the threat of Soviet air attacks on Romania, the unit was transferred to the front line and the major Luftwaffe airbase at Belaya Zerkov in the Ukraine south of Kiev. Graf achieved his first victory {{in the early hours of}} 4 August when his squadron was escorting a Junkers Ju 87 dive-bombing strike, shooting down one of a pair of attacking Polikarpov I-16 fighters. Despite his success, he was reprimanded by his squadron leader, because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> formation and forgotten to arm his guns before firing. His second victory was achieved the next day, although Graf was lucky to get away unscathed – landing his aircraft riddled with bullet holes.|$|E

5|$|Day-Lewis {{threw his}} {{personal}} version of method acting into full throttle in 1989 with his performance as Christy Brown in Jim Sheridan's My Left Foot, which garnered him numerous awards, including the Academy Award for Best Actor and BAFTA Award for Best Actor. Brown, {{a writer and}} painter, was born with cerebral palsy and was only able to control his left foot. Day-Lewis prepared for the role by making frequent visits to Sandymount School Clinic in Dublin, where he formed friendships with several people with disabilities, {{some of whom had}} no speech. During filming, he refused to break character. Playing a severely paralysed character on screen, off screen Day-Lewis had to be moved around the set in his wheelchair, and crew members would curse at having to lift him over camera and lighting wires, all so that he might gain insight into all aspects of Brown's life, including the embarrassments. Crew members were also required to spoon-feed him. It was rumoured that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> two ribs during filming from assuming a hunched-over position in his wheelchair for so many weeks, something he denied years later at the 2013 Santa Barbara International Film Festival.|$|E
5|$|Maulay {{remained}} in office {{under the new}} king, Henry III, who succeeded to the throne in late 1216. While at Corfe, he had custody of William of Lancaster, who had been captured by the royalist side at Rochester in 1215. Ranulf de Blondeville, the Earl of Chester, attempted to secure William's freedom but was rebuffed by Maulay, leading the earl to threaten to depart England and the king's cause and go on crusade. In early 1217 Maulay was ordered by the regent, William Marshal, to surrender control of Sherborne Castle and Somerset to William Longespee, the Earl of Salisbury, to help secure the return of Longespee to the royal cause. But Maulay refused to do so. In October 1217, Maulay was summoned to the royal court to answer charges that he had waged a private war against the earl over control of Somerset, and that <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> a truce that had held between the two men. The dispute was finally solved in February 1218 when Maulay was confirmed by the regent as custodian of Sherborne Castle and {{in the office of}} Sheriff of Somerset. Maulay compensated Longespee for his loss with a payment of 500 pounds, and a further payment of 1000 pounds by the government and custody of a royal ward.|$|E
5|$|William ceased his active {{service in}} the Royal Navy in 1790. When Britain {{declared}} war on France in 1793, he was anxious to serve his country and expected a command, but was not given a ship, perhaps at first because <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> his arm by falling down some stairs drunk, but later perhaps because he gave a speech in the House of Lords opposing the war. The following year he spoke in favour of the war, expecting a command after his change of heart; none came. The Admiralty did not reply to his request. He did not lose hope of being appointed to an active post. In 1798 he was made an admiral, but the rank was purely nominal. Despite repeated petitions, he was never given a command throughout the Napoleonic Wars. In 1811, he {{was appointed to the}} honorary position of Admiral of the Fleet. In 1813, he came nearest to any actual fighting, when he visited the British troops fighting in the Low Countries. Watching the bombardment of Antwerp from a church steeple, he came under fire, and a bullet pierced his coat.|$|E

5|$|During {{the first}} weeks of the summer, Cisneros called Fischer several times and asked him why <b>he</b> <b>had</b> <b>broken</b> up with her daughter. He told her Cristina was very kind, {{but he wanted to}} be single and date other girls. Cisneros then called Fischer's father, Buddy, and asked him why his son had broken up with Cristina. Fischer was angry that Cristina did not return his ring, and wrote a letter to her saying that he wanted his ring in ten days, or he would take action. Cisneros then called Buddy and told him she wanted to talk about his son's ring and other things; both agreed to meet at a Burger King. Cisneros asked Buddy why Fischer broke up with Cristina, and Buddy said that was between his son and her. He said his son was old enough to make his own decisions, and that he would not get involved. Cisneros then asked him if he knew Fischer drank, and he responded that at his son's age it was not {{uncommon}} to drink. Cisneros then said she had seen Fischer drunk once before, but his father responded by saying if he had been drunk before, it was not in his presence. Sex never came up in the conversation. Buddy told Cisneros he would speak to his son about acting like a gentleman; Cisneros promised to return Fischer's ring. Buddy recalled the meeting was awkward but friendly.|$|E
