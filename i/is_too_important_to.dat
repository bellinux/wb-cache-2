[...] "Wikipedia needs people to edit..." [...] and [...] "pseudoscience" [...] must be well substantiated before it can be added to an article. Skeptics also have edits removed when not well cited.

2500|$|Law and Society is an American movement, {{which was}} {{established}} after the Second World War through the initiative mainly of sociologists who had {{a vested interest in}} the study of law. The rationale of the Law and Society movement is subtly summed up in two short sentences by Lawrence Friedman: [...] "Law is a massive vital presence in the United States. It <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> be left to lawyers". Its founders believed that the [...] "study of law and legal institutions in their social context could be constituted as a scholarly field distinguished by its commitment to interdisciplinary dialogue and multidisciplinary research methods". The establishment of the Law and Society Association in 1964 and of the Law and Society Review in 1966 guaranteed continuity in the scholarly activities of the Law and Society movement and allowed its members to influence legal education and policy-making in the US.|$|E

A {{certain number}} of you, by faculty and natural disposition,--and all, so far as you are {{interested}} in modern art,--will necessarily have to put yourselves under the discipline of the Greek or chiaroscuro school, which is directed primarily to the attainment of the power of representing form by pure contrast of light and shade. I say, the [...] "discipline" [...] of the Greek school, both because, followed faithfully, it is indeed a severe one, and because to follow it at all is, for persons fond of colour, often a course of painful self-denial, from which young students are eager to escape. And yet, when the laws of both schools are rightly obeyed, the most perfect discipline is that of the colourists; for they see and draw everything, while the chiaroscurists must leave much indeterminate in mystery, or invisible in gloom: and there are therefore many licentious and vulgar forms of art connected with the chiaroscuro school, both in painting and etching, which have no parallel among the colourists. But both schools, rightly followed, require first of all absolute accuracy of delineation. This you need not hope to escape. Whether you fill your spaces with colours, or with shadows, they must equally be of the true outline and in true gradations. I have been thirty years telling modern students of art this in vain. I mean to say it to you only once, for the statement <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>important</b> <b>to</b> be weakened by repetition.|$|E
