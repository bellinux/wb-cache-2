40|$|Solar based {{thermal energy}} storage using molten salts is a highly {{developed}} process allowing for dispatchable generation of green electricity {{or other forms of}} energy. Varieties of storage material combinations facilitate {{thermal energy storage}} {{in a wide range of}} 100 °C up to 1000 °C making it feasible not only for solar applications but also waste heat management in industrial processes. Traditionally, solar salt ((Na,K) NO 3) or HitecXL ((Ca,Na,K) NO 3) are employed as heat storage media in such systems. HitecXL exhibits a significantly lower melting temperature of 131 °C compared to 220 - 250 °C in solar salt making it a promising heat transfer medium too e. g. for parabolic trough power plants due to the lower risk of freezing in system parts. The thermal properties molten salts are widely known and accepted however, thermal stability limits and decomposition mechanism under manifold conditions are scarce. In this work we demonstrate that <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> at different scales and subsequent analysis of the salt composition and its thermal properties is the most reliable strategy to assess stability limits of different nitrate salts. Results of <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> are compared to often-quoted TG measurements which only offer a comparative rather than quantitative view on thermal stability limits.

Upon long-term storage, the α-polymorph was preserved best in PVA-stabilized dispersions, followed by those stabilized with the glycocholate/phospholipid mixture and finally those stabilized solely with the bile salt. In particular for rapidly crystallized nanoparticles, the formation of an α-polymorph with highly reduced lamellarity was observed. According to time-/temperature-resolved synchrotron X-ray diffraction analysis with simultaneous DSC (differential scanning calorimetry) studies this less-ordered α-polymorph transformed into the common, lamellar α-form upon heating. Although the presence of the less-ordered form is probably related to the extraordinarily high stability of the metastable α-polymorph observed in some of the dispersions, it could not completely prevent the transition into the stable β-polymorph. The higher the transition temperature of the less-ordered α-form to the ordered one, the slower was the polymorphic transition to the stable β-polymorph.

40|$|University of Minnesota Ph. D. dissertation. November 2014. Major: Mechanical Engineering. Advisor: Perry Y. Li. 1 {{computer}} file (PDF); xii, 337 pages, appendices A-D. The high power density of fluid-powered actuators can facilitate design of compact and powerful devices. Pneumatic actuators {{in particular are}} preferred in human interactive devices due to their properties such as inherent compliance, backdrivability and benign consequences of leakage. A drawback of pneumatic actuators is that the current sources of compressed air are bulky and not suitable for mobile human-centered applications. To address these concerns, research is underway on advanced gas based actuation devices such as chemo-fluidic actuators, dry ice actuators, and mini-HCCI engines. These actuators are ideal for development of powerful and mobile devices for human scale applications. The operation of these devices typically requires direct human interaction between the pneumatic (or gas) actuated system and the human operator. Therefore safety of operation is imperative. One way of investigating interaction stability (and hence safe operation) between multiple systems is by using the framework of Passivity analysis from systems theory. The objective of the research presented in this dissertation is investigation of passivity characteristics of pneumatic actuators. This passivity analysis is a preliminary step in understanding the feasibility of using gas based actuators in human interactive applications. Passivity analysis requires definition of a storage function to quantify the effect of inputs and outputs on the system dynamics. The nonlinear dynamics of air compression and expansion in a pneumatic actuator {{are affected by the}} heat transfer across the walls of the actuator. In this thesis, physics based energy functions are developed and defined to be the storage function for three specific models of heat transfer viz adiabatic, isothermal, and finite heat transfer. For reversible thermodynamic process (adiabatic or <b>isothermal),</b> the <b>storage</b> function is defined as the work that can be extracted from the actuator. The storage function for actuator with finite heat transfer is defined as the maximum work that can be extracted from the pneumatic actuator. It is shown that the solution to this optimization problem provides a storage function similar to exergy of the air in the actuator. The supply rate based on these storage functions corresponds to physically meaningful power interaction between different subsystems, such as the actuator and the inertia load. Both adiabatic and isothermal actuators have two ports for power interaction : mechanical port corresponding to interaction with an inertial load, and fluid port corresponding to interaction with source/sink of compressed air. The adiabatic/isothermal actuator behaves as a two-port nonlinear spring with an active flow input at the fluid port of the actuator. Pneumatic actuator with finite heat transfer to the ambient has an additional port corresponding to the thermal interaction with the ambient. The supply rate to the pneumatic actuator with finite heat transfer illustrates that irrespective of chamber air temperature, heat transfer reduces the ability of the actuator to do work, thus contributing to passive behavior of the actuator. Energetically passive controller design for pneumatic actuated human power amplifier and tele-operated human scale devices is presented in this thesis. A framework for controlling the active flow variable at the fluid port of the pneumatic actuator to provide passive operation of a pneumatically actuated human power amplifier is presented by assuming the heat transfer model in the actuator to be either adiabatic or isothermal. This framework is then extended to define the framework for achieving co-ordinated tele-operation of multiple pneumatic actuated devices, while again amplifying input human power. The control problem is suitably defined within the proposed framework and a two-stage back-stepping controller is used to achieve the control objective. The Lyapunov function for the actuator controller design is defined based on the energy functions developed for adiabatic and isothermal actuators. The designed controllers are implemented on single-DOF systems and a multi-DOF robotic rescue crawler with pneumatic actuators. Experimental results confirming the efficacy of the proposed controller are provided. Finally, independent metering of each actuator chamber to improve the operational efficiency of the pneumatic actuators is investigated. In independent metering, two servo valves are used to control the air flow rate to the two chambers of the actuator. The valves are controlled to maintain a low operating pressure in both the chambers, while providing the desired actuator force. This mitigates the losses associated with discharge of high pressure air to atmosphere. Effectiveness of independent metering is evaluated in a single-DOF human power amplifier by assuming the heat transfer model in the actuator to be isothermal. Experimental results show 70...|$|R

40|$|The {{long term}} {{stability}} of amorphous solids formulated as dosage forms {{is a significant}} concern due to the inherent instability of the amorphous state {{and the potential for}} structural changes during storage. Initiation of changes such as those observed on appearance of a more stable crystalline phase, leads to the spontaneous and often catastrophic decrease of critical product performance attributes, including solubility and dissolution rate, which are prerequisite to realizing the bioavailability benefit of amorphous materials used as pharmaceuticals. ^ One aspect of particular interest to understanding pharmaceutically relevant amorphous solids is the phenomena of structural relaxation. Structural relaxation in this context refers to the physical changes in the locally preferred packing arrangement of molecules or groups of molecules attributed to aging or annealing. It is believed that the packing arrangement of molecules and groups of molecules, including the presence of a secondary (crystalline) phase, influences the physical state and the observed changes in the viscoelastic properties of an amorphous solid during storage. Further, the anisotropy or 2 ̆ 7 shape 2 ̆ 7 of the molecules that comprise these disordered materials plays an integral role in the maintenance of this microstructure. ^ Effects of time and <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> temperature on the physical state and viscoelastic properties of quench-cooled amorphous indomethacin were investigated using as-quenched and powdered preparations. When stored at greater than 12 °C below its glass transition temperature (45 - 47 °C), the as-quenched solid displays no evidence of crystalline indomethacin, whereas a measurable increase in crystalline content is detected for the powdered solid over the 24 h period examined. For storage temperatures greater than 22 °C below the glass transition temperature of the as prepared material, the data suggest that the extent of relaxation and the relative width of the glass transition region are equal to or greater than the powdered preparation over all temperature conditions studied. At storage temperatures closer to the glass transition temperature, these parameters are observed to decrease and approach the magnitude observed at lower storage temperatures. ^ An initial assessment of structural change in quench-cooled amorphous indomethacin on <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> was examined using pair distribution functions (PDF) derived from measured x-ray powder diffraction (XRPD) data. Structural change was examined relative to the PDF obtained for the as-quenched sample. The data suggests that a higher packing density is achieved after <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> as indicated by the decrease in the width of the nearest-neighbor and next nearest-neighbor PDF peaks. The greatest change was observed at Tg- 22 C, which corresponds with observations made from thermal analysis. ^ Effects of molecular anisotropy on the packing patterns and structure relaxation behavior of quench-cooled amorphous solids were also investigated using four structurally-diverse model compounds—salicin, indomethacin, felodipine and nifedipine. A simple physical description of each molecule and its corresponding packing pattern in as-quenched specimens were obtained by methods of direct observation and from total scattering using pair distribution functions. Thermal parameters were acquired by differential scanning calorimetry (DSC). The data suggest that the molecular packing coefficient and the aspect ratios of the molecule and the common packing distances are related to parameters commonly used to assess structural relaxation by thermal methods. Further, the as-quenched materials with the lower degree of packing (and presumably the greater free volume), as determined from the aspect ratio of the packing distances were found to change to a greater extent and at a more rapid rate on storage. Of particular interest, a power law relationship that relates the shift factor required for superposition of the structural relaxation rate data with the elapsed storage time was established. This evidence lends support for the fundamental role of molecular shape in determining the structural relaxation behavior on storage. ^ A conceptual model for the structural evolution of an amorphous solid during <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> below the glass transition region is proposed. In this model, a quench-cooled amorphous solid immediately after preparation is viewed as comprised of non-periodic, locally stable domain structures, which emerge as a direct consequence of the excess strain created in the microstructure during quench-cooling and the anisotropy of the constituent molecules. The dynamic structures maintained at equilibrium in the liquid phase persist during quench-cooling below the glass transition region, and increase in size as the system volume decreases with decreasing temperature. On impingement of these locally stable structures, two physical characteristics, which are important in the physical stability of the amorphous material during storage, result as a direct consequence of non-periodic structures packing in a reduced volume; high-energy interfaces resulting from unsatisfied bonding and defects or 2 ̆ 7 voids 2 ̆ 7 structures due to the incomplete filling of space. ...|$|E
40|$|A {{series of}} Pt/Mg-Al-O {{catalysts}} with different Mg/Al atomic ratios were prepared. The NOx storage capacities of these catalysts were measured by <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> at 350 degreesC. It {{was found that}} the NOx storage capacity increased with increasing Mg/Al atomic ratios. The catalytic behaviors of Pt/Mg-Al-O and Pt/MgO were studied with storage-reduction cycles at 400 degreesC. Under oxidizing conditions, NOx concentration in the outlet gas gradually increased with time, which indicated the catalysts could store NOx effectively. After a switch from oxidizing conditions to reducing conditions, NOx desorption peak emerged immediately due to the incomplete reduction of stored NOx, which lowered the total NOx conversion. With increasing Mg/Al atomic ratio in the catalysts, NOx conversion increases. Pt/MgO has the highest NOx conversion because of its best activity in the reduction of NOx by C 3 H 6. It seems that with an increasing amount of MgO in the catalysts, the self-poisoning of Pt-sites by adsorbed species during the reaction of NOx with C 3 H 6 may be inhibited effectively...|$|E
40|$|Aim: The aim was {{to study}} the changes in various {{physicochemical}} parameters of frozen buffalo meat undergone temperature abuse at two different <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> temperatures (37 ± 1 °C, 25 ± 1 °C) using a simulated model. Materials and Methods: Frozen buffalo meat was evaluated after exposing to various temperature abuse conditions over selected durations for different meat quality parameters including pH, extract release volume (ERV), flourescein diacetate (FDA) hydrolysis, free amino acid (FAA), total volatile basic nitrogen (TVBN) and D-glucose value and compared against a control sample maintained at 4 ± 1 °C. Results: Of the various meat quality parameters evaluated pH, FDA hydrolysis, FAA content and TVBN content showed a significant (p< 0. 05) increase in temperature abused samples after temperature abuse and on subsequent refrigerated storage. However, ERV and D-glucose content decreased significantly (p< 0. 05) in temperature abused buffalo meat {{during the same period}} of study. Conclusions: The present study featured the influence of exposure temperature and duration in various physicochemical parameters and the rate of spoilage development in frozen buffalo meat after temperature abuse...|$|E
40|$|Beside {{a loss in}} texture, {{the main}} quality aspect of filled {{chocolate}} products during storage {{is the development of}} fat bloom. For these products isothermal or cycling temperature storage tests are used for accelerated shelf life prediction. However, the applicability of these tests compared to real storage conditions is complicated and shelf life estimation is vague. Com; 1;paring storage tests of different authors is difficult because products and analysis methods vary. Additionally most of the storage tests are performed to identify the reasons for fat bloom and therefore the storage conditions are not separately investigated. However, all studies agree that temperature has a major impact due to its influence on migration and crystallization. While migration is accelerated at higher temperatures, crystallization shows an optimum at lower temperatures. Therefore, migration and crystal state have to be evaluated during storage, as well as fat bloom formation. In this study, cold stamped dark chocolate shells with nougat filling were chosen to compare isothermal and cycling temperature storage conditions. Cycling temperature storage at adequate levels includes optimum for fat bloom formation, but takes crystallization and migration influence in unequal account. In contrast, <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> at optimum temperature leads to faster fat bloom formation...|$|E
40|$|Periodical {{changes of}} {{temperature}} on an external surface of building envelope, e. g., thermal stress or excessive heat gains, {{is often an}} undesirable phenomenon. The idea proposed and described in the following paper is to stabilize the external surface temperature {{in a period of}} significant heat gains by the originally developed, novel composite modified by phase change material (PCM) and applied as an external, thin finishing plaster layer. The PCM composite is made from porous, granulated perlite soaked with paraffin wax (Tm = 25 °C) and macro-encapsulated by synthetic resin. The effect of temperature attenuation was estimated for two designated periods of time—the heat gains season (HGS) and the heat losses season (HLS). The attenuation coefficient (AC) was proposed as evaluation parameter of <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> of heat gains determining the reduction of temperature fluctuations. The maximum registered temperature of an external surface for a standard insulation layer was around 20 K higher than for the case modified by PCM. The calculated values of AC were relatively constant during HGS and around two times lower for PCM case. The obtained results confirmed that the proposed modification of an external partition by equipped with additional PCM layer can be effectively used to minimize temperature variations and heat flux in the heat gains season...|$|E
40|$|Heat {{supply for}} {{buildings}} {{accounts for about}} 40 % of primary energy onsumption in Europe. The main obstacle to a sustainable energy supply for buildings is the time gap between energy availability (solar heat in summer) and heating demand in winter. Storage of thermal energy may allow to bridge this gap and to reach high solar coverage rates for the heating supply of buildings. Within a study of a reference house in three climatic regions, with three insulation standards, two collector types, two storage designs (T-proportional as for hot water tanks and <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> as for PCM storages) and for two heating temperatures (30 °C and 50 °C, no DHW) a variation of collector area and storage capacity has been carried out. From the results, typical storage capacities and energy savings per storage capacity over the lifetime of the storage can be extracted. Sorption storages theoretically provide a promising possibility of compact thermal energy storage without losses over long times. In practice it proves {{to be very difficult}} to reach the aimed goals, especially for closed systems. To show some general reasons for this, the specific thermodynamic and technical limitations of closed adsorption storage systems are evaluated with the given storage system boundaries. The influence of losses both on an adsorption as well as on a reference hot water storage are discussed...|$|E
40|$|The {{influence}} of aqueous phase composition (0 – 40 wt. % sucrose, 0 and 150 mmol kg− 1 sodium chloride, NaCl) on {{the stability of}} 20 wt. % hydrogenated palm oil-in-water emulsions stabilized by 0. 9 wt. % whey protein isolate (WPI) to chilling and freezing was studied. Emulsion stability was measured after emulsions had been cooled to temperatures where (i) only the oil phase crystallized or (ii) both the oil and aqueous phases crystallized. Emulsion stability was assessed by DSC measurements of fat destabilization after cool–heat cycles (− 40 to 40 °C or − 10 to 40 °C), and by measurements of mean particle size, free oil, gravitational separation, and shear viscosity after <b>isothermal</b> <b>storage</b> (− 40 to 37 °C). Sucrose improved emulsion stability to droplet coalescence and gravitational separation, particularly at temperatures where part of the aqueous phase froze. The cryo-protective affect of sucrose was attributed to its ability {{to increase the amount}} of unfrozen water (UW), modify ice crystal structure, alter interfacial protein structure, and/or reduce the frequency of droplet–droplet collisions. NaCl promoted emulsion instability, particularly at holding temperatures where the oil was partially crystalline, which was attributed to its ability to facilitate the close approach of droplets by screening the electrostatic repulsion between them. These results have important implications for the formulation of emulsions that are stable to chilling and freezing...|$|E
