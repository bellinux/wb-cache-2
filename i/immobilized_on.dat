25|$|Pre-synthesized polymers, {{like the}} PDMEAMA/PTMSPMA block copolymer, can be <b>immobilized</b> <b>on</b> a surface (i.e. glass) by simply {{immersing}} {{the surface in}} an aqueous solution containing the polymer.

As expected, an inverse relationship exists between grafting density and molecular weight. As the antimicrobial activity depends on the concentration of quaternary ammonium tethered to the surface, grafting density and molecular weight represent opposing factors that can be manipulated to achieve high efficacy.|$|E

The anchoring step on pipecolic resin is very easy and efficient, and compounds are released with high purities upon acidic treatment. During this treatment, an oxazolonium intermediate is hydrolyzed, yielding the cleavage of ester or amide bond and the release of free carboxylic acid of the starting linker. In this study, we report the possibility of recycling the pipecolic resin after the use of several trifluoroacetic acid (TFA) cleavage cocktails.

40|$|This {{study is}} aiming to {{evaluate}} the performance of <b>immobilized</b> lipase <b>on</b> a chitosan support in transesterification reactions. Immobilized lipase improved the enzyme stability, allowing reusability, continuous operation {{and the possibility of}} better control of reactions. Chitosan offers several advantages as immobilization carrier such as versatility of available physical forms (flakes, porous beads, gel, fiber and membrane), low biodegradability and easy handling. In this study, porous bead of chitosan was used for immobilization of lipase from Candida rugosa. Lipase was immobilized by physical adsorption on chitosan beads. The ability of the immobilized lipase to catalyze transesterification of cooking oil was investigated. The important parameters like reaction time and oil to methanol molar ratios were studied to identify the performance comparison between free lipase and <b>immobilized</b> lipase <b>on</b> transesterification reaction. From the study it was found that maximum conversion of ester using immobilized lipase and free lipase were 73 and 77 %, respectively. These results are obtained at optimum conditions of 1 : 4 molar ratios and reaction time of 48 h. As a conclusion, the chitosan beads were appear as a suitable support for <b>immobilized</b> lipase <b>on</b> transesterification reaction even though the ester conversion was lower than free lipase...|$|R

40|$|The {{influence}} of bentonite modification by cationic surfactant hexadecyl-trimethyl-ammonium bromide (HDTMA-Br) and {{tetramethyl ammonium hydroxide}} (TMAOH) on its capability to immobilize lipase was studied. Modification of bentonite was conducted by the adding of 4 - 6 % (v/v) HDTMA-Br and TMAOH respectively. The obtained immobilized lipases then were characterized to observe the optimum pH and temperature {{as well as their}} stability during reuse application. The observed results show that there is {{no significant difference between the}} variations of HDTMA-Br concentrations to the percentage of immobilized enzyme which can immobilize lipase up to 75 - 78 %. However, the best concentration of TMAOH is 4 % (v/v) which can immobilize lipase up to 97. 95 %. The obtained <b>immobilized</b> lipases <b>on</b> HDTMA-Br-modified bentonite show the optimum catalytic activity on reaction temperature of 35 - 40 oC and pH of 7. 5.

30|$|The {{sensitivity}} of an ELISA {{depends on the}} parameters such as {{the interaction between the}} antigen and the antibody, the temperature, the pH, and the efficiency of the antigen attachment on the PS surface. Among these factors, the immobilization of the antigen or antibody on the PS plate plays a crucial role in improving the limit of detection. Moreover, the limitation posed by the attachment and the nonuniform distribution of protein on the PS surface highly affects the assay sensitivity [5]. A higher quantity with the proper immobilization of protein aids in achieving the right orientation on the PS surface for possible improvements in detection. Different strategies have been employed to <b>immobilize</b> proteins properly <b>on</b> the PS surface. A protein or antibody has the ability to <b>immobilize</b> <b>on</b> the PS plate simply by chemical or physical adsorption or electrostatic interaction. Bora et al. [15] <b>immobilized</b> protein <b>on</b> the PS surface using photochemistry, and they found improvements of up to 1.5 - to 2 -fold higher compared to the untreated surface. In another study, the efficient immobilization of protein on the PS plate with a polymer called polyvinyl benzyl lactonoylamide (PVLA) was shown [16]. Polyethylene glycol (PEG)-based polymers have also provided for the efficient immobilization of biomolecules on sensing surfaces. Lakshmipriya et al. [17] developed an improved detection of clotting protein factor IX by immobilizing its thiolated oligomer along with two polymers (PEG-b-PAAc and N 6 -PEG) on a gold-coated surface.|$|R
40|$|Batch and {{continuous}} fermentations at two different temperatures using <b>immobilized</b> cells <b>on</b> apple, quince and pear pieces {{were carried out}} separately {{and the effect of}} fermentation temperature, type of fermentation and immobilization support on kinetic parameters and on quality characteristics of the produced wines was investigated. Duncan's multiple range test showed that higher temperature (30 degrees C) resulted in higher wine productivity. Statistically higher wine productivity was also observed when quinceimmobilized biocatalyst was used in continuous fermentation compared to batch system at the same temperature. In contrast, wine productivity was statistically higher in batch fermentations compared to continuous process when apple and pear-supported biocatalysts were employed in wine making at 15 degrees C. Although volatile acidity in wines produced by <b>immobilized</b> cells <b>on</b> pear pieces was a little increased and statistically higher compared to wines produced by <b>immobilized</b> cells <b>on</b> apple and quince pieces, it still remained in levels usually found in dry wines. No vinegar odor was observed. Ethyl acetate concentration was higher in wines produced at lower temperature (15 degrees C) contributing to the fruity character of the product. The content of methanol, amyl and higher (propanol- 1 and isobutanol) alcohols in all wines was found in very low levels, leading to improved quality products. Low-temperature (15 degrees C) wine-fermentation resulted in improved quality and the produced wines had a distinctive aromatic profile. Apple appears to have an advantage over quince and pear, as it is widely cultivated, it is considered more compatible with wine taste, while continuous process using <b>immobilized</b> cells <b>on</b> apple pieces resulted in high wine productivity.
