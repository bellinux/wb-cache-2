5000|$|A {{lap joint}} {{may be a}} full lap or half lap. In a full lap, no {{material}} is removed from either of the members to be joined, resulting in a joint which is the combined thickness of the two members. In a half lap joint or <b>halving</b> <b>joint,</b> material is removed from both of the members so that the resulting joint is {{the thickness of the}} thickest member. Most commonly in half lap joints, the members are of the same thickness and half the thickness of each is removed.|$|E
40|$|This report clarifies {{the effects}} of the oblique cutting of wood {{perpendicular}} to the grain with a rebating plane in the wood working of the <b>halving</b> <b>joint</b> and the tenon joint. Air-dried specimens of white seraya (parashorea malaanonan Merr.), Sugi (Cryptomeria japonica), and shirakashi (Quercus myrsinaefolia) were used in this study, and were cut by feeding a tool, which was set on the same experimental apparatus as used in the previous report 1). In order to compare with the oblique cutting of wood perpendicular to the grain, the oblique cutting of wood parallel to the grain was performed, too. The deformation of the chip and the roughness of the workpiece cutting-surface were observed relatively and estimated sensuously. And {{the effects of}} the cutting conditions (the inclination angle (i) of the tool and the depth of cut (tn)) and the workpiece conditions (the wood species, the grain orientation, the annual rings, and the ray orientation of the workpiece) upon them are discussed...|$|E
50|$|A <b>halved</b> <b>joint</b> is a {{woodworking}} {{joint in}} which the two members are joined by removing material from each at the point of intersection so that they overlap. The <b>halved</b> <b>joint</b> is differentiated from the lap joint in that the members are joined on edge, rather than on the flat.|$|R
2500|$|The amphitheater's {{colonnade}} {{is formed}} by three concentric rings of 46 square brick columns. Each column is approximately [...] on a side.

50|$|Each span {{comprises}} 2No. riveted longitudinal {{steel deck}} girders, supporting riveted cross girders, {{which in turn}} support a reinforced concrete slab deck. The bridge has two sets of approach spans, {{each of which has}} three spans, either side of the central main lifting span. Each set of three spans consists of two simply supported end spans which continue as cantilevers approximately 1/5 span into the middle span. The central 3/5 span sections are simply supported drop in spans supported by <b>halving</b> <b>joints.</b> The main span is a structurally independent lifting span. The bearings are inset from the end lifting beams. Spans 1, 3, 5 and 7 are 24.994m c/c of bearings. Spans 2 and 6 are 26.213m, with <b>halving</b> <b>joints</b> 5.334m from both end and a 15.547m suspended span. The central lifting span, Span 4, is 31.242m c/c of bearings, with cantilevers of 3.124m either end to the lifting cross girders. The approach spans have cross girders spaced 2.438m apart, and the lifting girder has cross girders spaced 6.248m.|$|R

2500|$|When the {{wreckage}} of the vessel Götheborg was found in 1984, the idea to make a replica of the vessel emerged. The keel for the replica was laid on 11June 1995. This was done at the disused Eriksbergs wharf by the Göta älv in Gothenburg. Led by Master of Ceremonies Anders Wästfeldt, two silver coins, one from 1745, and one from 1995, were placed in the <b>halved</b> <b>joints</b> of the [...] long keel. About 3,000 people attended the forging of the keel, including Sören Gyll, director of Volvo and professor Jorgen Weibull. The project was blessed by the vicar Alf Österholm.|$|R
50|$|The simple <b>halved</b> <b>joint</b> {{is created}} by cutting a slot in {{opposite}} edges of the members to be joined so that they slip together. Most commonly, the amount of material removed is equal to half {{the width of the}} members being joined, although this depends on the relative dimensions of the members. This joint is relatively weak and prone to splitting, {{due to the lack of}} shoulders which would otherwise prevent twisting. When extra strength is required, a strengthened version of the joint is called for. This involves a more elaborate cut out which incorporates shoulders to prevent twisting of the joint.|$|R

50|$|In 1953, Boyd {{successfully}} {{achieved the}} vision of the combination of window and wall and launched The Stegbar 'Windowall' that year. The firm of Stegbar had been founded in Melbourne in 1946 by Brian Stegley (1920-1974) ('Steg-') and George Barrow ('-bar') with the intention of manufacturing clock cases and office furniture. In 1950 Stegbar made timber windows from their factory on the corner of Bay and Aberdeen Roads in Sandringham. Robin Boyd designed the Stegbar 'Windowall' system which revolutionised the firm's economic base. The overall appearance of the Stegbar 'Windowall' was light but the frames made of hardwood were resilient enough to hold any roof load.Individual framing members were continuous in both directions - unbroken mullions and transoms - intersecting each other in a copyright <b>halved</b> <b>joint,</b> alike a floor to ceiling window.|$|R

40|$|A {{mechanical}} {{end joint}} system is presented that eliminates {{the possibility of}} free movements between the <b>joint</b> <b>halves</b> during loading or vibration. Both node joint body (NJB) and column end joint body (CEJB) have cylindrical engaging ends. Each of these ends has an integral semicircular tongue and groove. The two <b>joint</b> <b>halves</b> are engaged transversely - the tongue of the NJB mating with the groove of the CEJB and vice versa. The joint system employs a spring loaded internal latch mechanism housed in the CEJB. During mating, this mechanism is {{pushed away from the}} NJB and enters the NJB when mating is completed. In order to lock the joint and add a preload across the tongue and groove faces, an operating ring collar is rotated through 45 deg causing an internal mechanism to compress a Belleville washer preload mechanism. This causes an equal and opposite force to be exerted on the latch bolt and the latch plunger. This force presses the two <b>joint</b> <b>halves</b> tightly together. In order to prevent inadvertent disassembly, a secondary lock is also engaged when the joint is closed. Plungers are carried in the operating ring collar. When the joint is closed, the plungers fall into tracks on the CEJB, which allows the joint to be opened only when the operating ring collar and plungers are pushed directly away from the joining end. One application of this invention is the rapid assembly and disassembly of diverse skeletal framework structures which is extremely important in many projects involving the exploration of space...|$|R

50|$|Improvements {{in plate}} rolling allowed {{a change in}} the shape of the girder. Rather than merely a slightly-curved top plate with {{triangular}} gussets, it was now possible to roll a semi-circular plate. This allowed the fully developed 'balloon' shape to be used, as in the second cross-section illustrated. The top web of the girder was semi-circular and riveted to the centre plate by an L-strip. The side gussets, also curved, were riveted parallel to the edges of this top plate, rather than through another L-strip, as used originally. Brunel (probably correctly) considered the smooth balloon profile to be a more efficient design, influenced by his geometric approaches to design rather than Eaton's mathematical analysis. More practically, the parallel lap <b>joint</b> <b>halved</b> the amount of riveting needed, compared to the L-strip.|$|R
40|$|A {{structural}} optimization {{procedure is}} {{used to determine the}} shape of an alternate design for the shuttle solid rocket booster field joint. In contrast to the tang and clevis design of the existing joint, this alternate design consists of two flanges bolted together. Configurations with 150 studs of 1 1 / 8 in. diameter and 135 studs of 1 3 / 16 in. diameter are considered. Using a nonlinear programming procedure, the joint weight is minimized under constraints on either von Mises or maximum normal stresses, joint opening and geometry. The procedure solves the design problem by replacing it by a sequence of approximate (convex) subproblems; the pattern of contact between the <b>joint</b> <b>halves</b> is determined every few cycles by a nonliner displacement analysis. The minimum weight design has 135 studs of 1 3 / 16 in. diameter and is designed under constraints on normal stresses. It weighs 1144 lb per joint more than the current tang and clevis design...|$|R
50|$|The {{rights of}} the {{ultimate}} beneficiaries in the massed estate have undergone considerable change. Under the common law their rights in the first-dying testator’s share of the massed property were real rights, being conferred by will, while their right in the survivor’s share were personal rights only since they were of a semi-contractual nature and since the will of one person cannot confer a real right in the property of another person. It followed that the survivor retained the dominium {{in his or her}} share of the property even after adiation, and could thus validly alienate or mortgage such share. If the survivor went insolvent after adiation and before transfer of the property to’ the beneficiaries the latter would rank merely as concurrent creditors in the insolvent estate. To remedy this state of affairs a vitally important change was made in 1913 by the Administration of Estates Act in respect of mutual wills of spouses married in community of property. Where such a will effected a massing and the survivor adiated, the Act in effect placed the two <b>halves</b> of the <b>joint</b> estate upon exactly the same footing by giving the beneficiaries the same rights in respect of the survivor’s half as they possessed in the half of the first-dying spouse. Given the state of the common law at the time this meant that the beneficiaries acquired real rights in the entire estate. Under the modern system of administering deceased estates, however, the beneficiaries under a will acquire only personal rights against the executor before transfer to them of the bequeathed property.|$|R
