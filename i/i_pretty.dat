Beginning in 1967, he showed an interest in Buddhism; after a few months' study at Tibet House in London, he was told by a Lama, [...] "You don't want to be Buddhist.... You should follow music". By 1975 Bowie admitted, [...] "I felt totally, absolutely alone. And I probably was alone because <b>I</b> <b>pretty</b> much had abandoned God".|$|E
500|$|Despite its poor {{performance}} at the American box office, Labyrinth was a success on home video and later on DVD.

500|$|The {{scene in}} which Grimes regains {{consciousness}} and investigates his situation {{is reminiscent of the}} British horror films The Day of the Triffids (1962) and 28 Days Later (2002). Kirkman insisted that the similarities especially with 28 Days Later was coincidental. [...] "I saw 28 Days Later shortly before the first issue of Walking Dead was released," [...] he stated. [...] "That first issue came out in October of 2003 and 28 Days Later was released in the States in June of 2003. So we were working on our second issue by the time I saw it. It {{was going to be a}} matter of somehow trying to restage the entire first issue, because it was a very similar coma opening. I made a decision—which <b>I</b> <b>pretty</b> much regret at this point—I said, 'You know what? It's so different , I will probably never hear anything about this.' And I was wrong." ...|$|E

Instead, he learned his lines in English and translated the dialogue mentally during each take. In a scene between Dexter and Vince Masuka (C.S. Lee), Masuka pauses after examining a corpse and says, [...] "I'm hungry." [...] Michael C. Hall said that [...] "C.S. [...] ad libs are different every time. When he said, 'I'm hungry,' that was the only take that I didn't laugh." [...] When asked about improvising on the show, Lee said that the writers [...] "come up with some good lines themselves. [...] So <b>I</b> <b>pretty</b> much leave it up to them." ...|$|E

2500|$|With many of {{the stories}} he had planned for America's Best Comics brought to an end, and with his {{increasing}} dissatisfaction with how DC Comics were interfering with his work, he decided to once more {{pull out of the}} comics mainstream. In 2005, he remarked that [...] "I love the comics medium. <b>I</b> <b>pretty</b> much detest the comics industry. Give it another 15 months, I'll probably be pulling out of mainstream, commercial comics." [...] The only ABC title continued by Moore was The League of Extraordinary Gentlemen; after cutting ties with DC he launched the new League saga, , in a co-publishing partnership of Top Shelf Productions and Knockabout Comics, the first part released in 2009, the second in 2011 and the third released in 2012.|$|E

In 1996, Capitol Records was preparing a contract for Underwood but canceled it when company management changed. Underwood said of the event, [...] "I honestly think it's a lot better that nothing came out of it now, because I wouldn't have been ready then. Everything has a way of working out." [...] While at Checotah High School, she was an Honor Society member, a cheerleader, and played basketball and softball. Underwood graduated from Checotah High School in 2001 as salutatorian. She chose not to pursue singing after graduation. She said, [...] "After high school, <b>I</b> <b>pretty</b> much gave up on the dream of singing. I had reached a point in my life where I had to be practical and prepare for my future in the 'real world'".

2500|$|The {{music video}} for [...] "Stay" [...] was {{directed}} by Sophie Muller. On February 10, 2013, whilst walking the red carpet of the 55th Grammy Awards, Rihanna held an interview with Ryan Seacrest who officially revealed that the music video would premiere on E! News the following day. Rihanna described the production saying, [...] "The video was really, really simple. <b>I</b> <b>pretty</b> much stayed put in a bathtub, and we shot it really tight, really close. There's Mikky Ekko in the video as well. This {{is the first time}} I've ever collaborated with him, so I'm excited about that because he's actually the one who wrote the song and I kinda just {{fell in love with it}} so much and in love with the tone of his voice and we wanna keep him a part of it, so you'll see him in the video." [...] The singer added, [...] "It's a very emotional song and it's personal, so you just think about, it's almost like telling a story, and when you tell a story, even to yourself — if you're saying it out loud and expressing how you feel — it needs to be powerful because it needs to be authentic." [...] On February 11, Rihanna leaked an [...] "uncut" [...] version of the video on Twitter prior to the official premiere, featuring the singer performing to the track in one singular take, without Mikky Ekko. The official version premiered on E! News later that day. It was then uploaded to Rihanna's official VEVO account at 8AM ET the following day. Shortly after the video was uploaded, it was flagged by YouTube for its sexual content. The flag has since been removed.|$|E
2500|$|National {{media outlets}} {{reported}} on an exchange between judge Harry Connick Jr. and contestant Quentin Alexander noting the incident of Connick scolding a contestant was awkward. On the live airing of the Top 6 show, there was three contestants {{who had not}} been saved when Alexander was chosen. After he performed, host Ryan Seacrest noted that he appeared to be upset. When asked Alexander responded [...] "This sucks, We've got two of the best vocalists, my best friend [...] sitting over there. This whole thing is whack, but I'm going to shut up right now." [...] Seacrest then replied saying that this is a competition, and with the save anything could happen. When Alexander had left the stage, Connick Jr. said, [...] "Quentin, if it's that whack, then you can always go home, because Idol is paying {{a lot of money to}} give you this experience and for you to say that to this hand that is feeding you right now, I think is highly disrespectful." [...] Alexander was then prompted by the producers to return to the stage where he approached the judges and clarified he meant the two being potentially eliminated was whack, not the show, or the experience. Later, after performing his second song, he explained [...] "I understand that these things are going to happen, and I just didn't want my friend to leave" [...] and apologized. Judge Jennifer Lopez empathized with Alexander's emotions running high but said that as an artist he had to learn to work through that even when it happens to put on the performance. Joey Cook commented after being eliminated on Alexander's statements: <b>I</b> <b>pretty</b> much just told him what he did was beautiful, in my opinion, and it was the perfect representation of him. Quentin is a very emotional person. He’s very 'all cards on the table.' There is no sugar coating. He doesn’t hide his emotions. He’s honest. He’s a raw human being, and I think what happened last night was the perfect example of that and how emotional of a person he is.|$|E
