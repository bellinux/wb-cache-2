This resulted in the global average temperature dropping by about [...] As volcanic ash falls out of the atmosphere rapidly, the negative agricultural effects of the eruption were largely immediate and localized to a relatively small area {{in close proximity to}} the eruption, as they were caused by the resulting thick ash cover that resulted. Globally however, despite a several-month 5% drop in overall solar irradiation, and a reduction in direct sunlight by 30%, there was no negative impact to global agriculture. Surprisingly, a 3-4 year increase in global Agricultural productivity and forestry growth was observed, excepting boreal forest regions. The means by which this was discovered, is that initially at the time, a mysterious <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> at which carbon dioxide (CO2) was filling the atmosphere was observed, which is charted in {{what is known as the}} [...] "Keeling Curve". This led numerous scientists to assume that this reduction was due to the lowering of the Earth's temperature, and with that, a slow down in plant and soil respiration, indicating a deleterious impact to global agriculture from the volcanic haze layer. However upon actual investigation, the reduction in the rate at which carbon dioxide filled the atmosphere did not match up with the hypothesis that plant respiration rates had declined. Instead the advantageous anomaly was relatively firmly linked to an unprecedented increase in the growth/net primary production, of global plant life, resulting in the increase of the carbon sink effect of global photosynthesis. The mechanism by which the increase in plant growth was possible, was that the 30% reduction of direct sunlight can also be expressed as an increase or [...] "enhancement" [...] in the amount of diffuse sunlight. With, owing to its intrinsic nature, can illuminate under-canopy leaves permitting more efficient total whole-plant photosynthesis than would otherwise be the case. In stark contrast to the effect of totally clear skies and the direct sunlight that results from it, which casts shadows onto understorey leaves, strickly limiting plant photosynthesis to the top canopy layer. This increase in global agriculture from the volcanic haze layer also naturally results as a product of other aerosols that are not emitted by volcanoes, such as man-made [...] "moderately thick smoke loading" [...] pollution, as the same mechanism, the [...] "aerosol direct radiative effect" [...] is behind both.|$|E

50|$|The {{onset of}} {{volcanism}} within the basin, {{the beginning of}} the volcanic synrift phase, was also the foundation of the Nahe Subgroup. At the same time, under semiarid conditions, fluvial-alluvial sedimentation conditions were dominant in the Saar-Nahe Basin which, according to Stollhofen (1991), was brought about by a marked <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of subsidence.

30|$|Because {{the timing}} of onset of the {{observed}} temperature increases was similar between sites ASY and SNY, we suggest that the volatiles inferred to have been introduced to both of these regions simultaneously, might have originated from a single, deep-seated volatile source (Fig. 9). The observed difference in duration of these temperature increases is explained as follows. At site ASY, an underground hot-spring exists {{at a depth of}} 60 m, below which the low-permeability clay layer exists, and {{we know that there are}} no fumaroles at the surface. Therefore, any volatiles present in that region are likely to be stored mostly at depth, and to have subsequently migrated gradually into shallow regions. In contrast, a high-temperature (~ 97 °C) fumarolic zone exists at site SNY. Therefore, volatiles supplied to this site could escape to the surface, resulting in the observed sudden <b>drop</b> <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>rate</b> of temperature increase. Because the distance between the SNY and ASY sites is approximately 5 km, their volatile source could be located at relatively deep levels in the crust.|$|E

This defect is partially rescued when the mutant protein is mixed with sufficient levels of wild type RecA protein. Functional extension complexes form most readily when wild type RecA is in excess of RecA K 72 R.
