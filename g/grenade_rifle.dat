5|$|In February 1917, the British General Staff {{released}} a training pamphlet titled SS 143 Instructions for the Training of Platoons for Offensive Action, espousing {{the return to}} the pre-war emphasis on fire and movement tactics {{and the use of}} the platoon as a self-contained tactical unit. The short pamphlet noted the importance of dedicated hand <b>grenade,</b> <b>rifle</b> grenade and machine gun sections in suppressing enemy strong points with an appropriate level of fire to permit other military units to advance. Coupled with the observations and suggestions made by Currie in the report he submitted in January 1917 following the Verdun lectures, the Canadian Corps instilled the tactical change with vigour. The corps instilled the tactical doctrine for small units by assigning objectives down to the platoon level. Assaulting infantry battalions used hills behind the lines as full-scale model representations of the battlefield. Taped lines demarcated German trench lines while officers on horseback carried flags to represent the advancing front of the artillery barrage.|$|E

50|$|The rifle {{was able}} to fire <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades.</b> Various {{attachable}} <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher models were designed during World War I.|$|R
50|$|In 1942, an {{attachable}} <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher {{called the}} Gewehrgranatengerät or Schiessbecher ("shooting cup") was introduced {{that was developed}} based on <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher models designed during World War I. The 30 mm Schiessbecher cup-type <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher could be mounted on any Karabiner 98k and was intended to replace all previous <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher models. The <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher could be used against infantry, fortifications and light armored vehicles up {{to a range of}} 280 m (306 yd). For these differing tasks, several specialized grenades with accompanying special propelling cartridges were developed for the 1,450,113 produced Schiessbecher <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launchers. The <b>rifle</b> grenade-propelling cartridges fired a wooden projectile through the barrel to the <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> that, upon impact, automatically primed the <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade.</b> The Schiessbecher could be mounted on the Karabiner 98a, G98/40, StG 44 and FG 42.|$|R

50|$|The first British HEAT {{weapon to}} be {{developed}} and issued was a rifle grenade using a 63.5 mm cup launcher {{on the end of}} the rifle barrel; the <b>Grenade,</b> <b>Rifle</b> No. 68 /AT which was first issued to the British Armed Forces in the year 1940. This has some claim to have been the first HEAT warhead and launcher in use. The design of the warhead was simple and was capable of penetrating 52 mm of armour. The fuze of the grenade was armed by removing a pin in the tail which prevented the firing pin from flying forward. Simple fins gave it stability in the air and, provided the grenade hit the target at the proper angle of 90 degrees, the charge would be effective. Detonation occurred on impact, when a striker in the tail of the grenade overcame the resistance of a creep spring and was thrown forward into a stab detonator.|$|E

During a flank assault on high ground {{held by the}} enemy, Private Hayashi rose alone {{in the face of}} <b>grenade,</b> <b>rifle,</b> and machine gun fire. Firing his automatic rifle from the hip, he charged and overtook an enemy machine gun position, killing seven men in the nest and two more as they fled. After his platoon advanced 200 yards from this point, an enemy antiaircraft gun opened fire on the men. Private Hayashi returned fire at the hostile position, killing nine of the enemy, taking four prisoners, and forcing the remainder of the force to withdraw from the hill. Private Hayashi’s extraordinary heroism and devotion to duty are in keeping with the highest traditions of military service and reflect great credit on him, his unit, and the United States Army.|$|E
5000|$|The President of the United States of America takes {{pride in}} {{presenting}} the Navy Cross (Posthumously) to Lieutenant Colonel William Frederick Harris (MCSN: 0-5917), United States Marine Corps, for extraordinary heroism in connection with military operations against an armed enemy of the United Nations while serving as Commanding Officer of the Third Battalion, Seventh Marines, FIRST Marine Division (Reinforced), in action against enemy aggressor forces in the Republic of Korea the early morning of 7 December 1950. Directing his Battalion in affording flank protection for the regimental vehicle train and the first echelon of the division trains proceeding from Hagaru-ri to Koto-ri, Lieutenant Colonel Harris, despite numerous casualties suffered in the bitterly fought advance, promptly went into action when a vastly outnumbering, deeply entrenched hostile force suddenly attacked at point-blank range from commanding ground during the hours of darkness. With his column disposed on open, frozen terrain and {{in danger of being}} cut off from the convoy as the enemy laid down enfilade fire from a strong roadblock, he organized a group of men and personally led them in a bold attack to neutralize the position with heavy losses to the enemy, thereby enabling the convoy to move through the blockade. Consistently exposing himself to devastating hostile <b>grenade,</b> <b>rifle</b> and automatic weapons fire throughout repeated determined attempts by the enemy to break through, Lieutenant Colonel Harris fought gallantly with his men, offering words of encouragement and directing their heroic efforts in driving off the fanatic attackers. Stout-hearted and indomitable despite tremendous losses in dead and wounded, Lieutenant Colonel Harris, by his inspiring leadership, daring combat tactics and valiant devotion to duty, contributed to the successful accomplishment of a vital mission and upheld the highest traditions of the United States Naval Service.

50|$|The Japanese Army, {{noting that}} grenades were short-ranged weapons, began efforts to {{optimize}} these weapons for close-in infantry fighting.

50|$|The {{casualties}} {{caused by}} machine gun fire {{led to the}} widespread deployment of light machine guns such as the Lewis Gun within minor infantry units. Trench warfare also led to the rapid development of new designs of <b>grenades,</b> <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades</b> and light mortars—all of which represented a rapid increase in the firepower available to low-level commanders. There was a growing emphasis on field craft, especially in the British and Dominion Armies, where night-patrolling and raiding tactics soon also demanded an increase in map-reading and navigation skills. The infantryman of 1914 was content to be trained in rifle and bayonet and usually attacked in battalion formations. By 1917 {{he was used to}} <b>grenades,</b> <b>rifle</b> <b>grenades,</b> light machine-guns and more specialized weapons and usually worked his way forward using platoon or section tactics.|$|R
50|$|The bullet-trap <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> became {{increasing}} {{popular in}} the post-wars the years, most notably the French AC58 anti-armour and APAV40 multi-purpose <b>grenades.</b> The 22mm <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launchers were further simplified, becoming {{an integral part of}} the rifle itself.

The differences between the three cartridges {{have to do with the}} powder charge and the subsequent range of the launchers. The M1 was a universal <b>Rifle</b> <b>Grenade</b> cartridge that replaced the specialized <b>Rifle</b> <b>Grenade</b> (RG), Chemical <b>Rifle</b> <b>Grenade</b> (CRG), and Chemical Warfare Grenade (CWG) cartridges and was used with cup-discharger <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launchers. The M2 was an experimental cartridge used as a testbed; it used a propellant mixture of black powder and smokeless powder because it was feared that the smokeless powder would not reliably ignite by itself. The M3 was designed to be used with the M1 series (for the M1903 Springfield rifle), M2 series (for the M1917 Enfield rifle), M7 series (for the M1 Garand rifle), and M8-series (for the M1 Carbine) spigot grenade launchers and used a propellant that was a mixture of a 5-grain amount of FFFG black powder and a 40-grain amount of IMR-4898 smokeless powder. The M3E1 featured an extended case neck, a rosepetal crimp, and a full smokeless powder loading and was designed for use with the M7A3 spigot <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade</b> launcher and larger ENERGA <b>rifle</b> <b>grenade.</b> The Grenade Blanks were issued in double-rowed 10-round cartons, usually as part of a set with the M13 metal Grenade Launcher Assortment ammo can.|$|R
