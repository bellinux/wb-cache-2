We analysed data on a representative sample of Slovak adolescents 8502 adolescents (mean age 13. 21, 49. 4 % boys) from the 2014 Health Behaviour in School-aged Children cross-sectional study.

Adolescents consuming both alcohol and <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> were at higher risk of negative behavioural outcomes than their peers who drank only alcohol or <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> or were non-consumers. Consumers of alcohol and <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> were highly prone to be involved in fighting-the joint association of alcohol and <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> consumption was greater than sum of its associations separately in relation to fighting (SI 1. 49; 95 % confidence interval 1. 03 - 2. 16).

40|$|Consumption of {{chocolate}} milk in the United States is growing {{as an alternative}} beverage to sports and <b>energy</b> <b>drinks.</b> Recent literature suggests that consumption {{of chocolate}} milk vis-?-vis sports and <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> is an effective recovery aid after prolonged workouts. In this light, knowledge of price sensitivity, substitutes/ complements and demographic profiling with respect to consumption of chocolate milk is important for manufacturers, retailers and advertisers of chocolate milk. Using household-level purchase data for chocolate milk, <b>energy</b> <b>drinks,</b> and sports drinks and related demopraphic characteristics from the 2011 Nielsen Homescan data, we estimated three beverage demand models to show that chocolate milk is a substitute for <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> in consumption. Sports drinks are complementary in consumption for <b>energy</b> <b>drinks.</b> Chocoate milk and <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> are complements for sports drinks in consumption. According to own-price elasticity of demand for three beverages, we find {{that all of them}} are between - 1 and 0 which means that they are price inelastic. The household size, age, education, race, region, the presence of children, gender of household heads are significant determinants of demand for chocolate milk. Household size, age, employment status, education, race, region, the presence of children in a household, gender of household heads significantly affect the demand of <b>energy</b> <b>drinks.</b> Significant demographic variables affecting the demand of sports drinks include household size, age, education, race, region, the presence of children, gender of household heads. It {{is important to note that}} data used in this work only capture at home purchase/consumption of chocolate milk, <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> and sports drinks. As a result, household?s behavior with respect to away-from home consumption of these beverages is not captured in this thesis...|$|R

In order to determine the attitudes of drivers toward the impact of <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> and caffeine, a research was conducted using a questionnaire form and the targeted group of the survey were drivers. The research was conducted in the City of Belgrade in December 2012. There were 420 survey papers distributed to drivers of different age groups of which 412 were returned. The survey was completely anonymous and consisted of two parts. The first part was related to basic demographic information about the respondents and it had 8 closed type questions. These questions were responded by circling one of the offered answers. The second part of the survey referred to determining the driver’s attitudes about <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> and caffeine. The second part consisted of 26 questions and respondents were to use a five-level scale in order to show to what extent they agree or disagree with any of the listed statements. The results show that <b>energy</b> <b>drinks</b> are consumed mostly by young people, less than 25 years old. The effect of caffeine on gender is statistically significant.
