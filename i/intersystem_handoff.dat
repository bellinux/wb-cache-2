40|$|Abstract—Next-generation {{wireless}} systems (NGWS) integrate different wireless networks, each {{of which}} is optimized for some specific services and coverage area to provide ubiquitous communications to the mobile users. It is an important and challenging issue to support seamless handoff management in this integrated architecture. The existing handoff management protocols are not sufficient to guarantee handoff support that is transparent to the applications in NGWS. In this work, a cross-layer (Layer 2 + 3) handoff management protocol, CHMP, is developed to support seamless intra and <b>intersystem</b> <b>handoff</b> management in NGWS. Cross-layer handoff management protocol uses mobile’s speed and handoff signaling delay information to enhance the handoff performance of Mobile IP that is proposed to support mobility management in wireless IP networks. First, the handoff performance of Mobile IP is analyzed with respect to its sensitivity to the link layer (Layer 2) and network layer (Layer 3) parameters. Then, a cross-layer handoff management architecture is developed using the insights learnt from the analysis. Based on this architecture, the detailed design of CHMP is carried out. Finally, extensive simulation experiments are carried out to evaluate the performance of CHMP. The theoretical analysis and simulation results show that CHMP significantly enhances the performance of both intra and intersystem handoffs.

40|$|International audienceCurrently, {{there exist}} {{disparate}} wireless networks, such as Bluetooth for personal areas, wireless LANs (WLANs) for local areas, GSM and UMTS for wide areas. These networks {{are designed for}} specific service needs and vary widely in terms of bandwidth, latency, area of coverage, cost, and quality of service (QoS) provisioning. None of the existing wireless systems can simultaneously satisfy the low latency, high bandwidth, and ubiquitous coverage needs of mobile users at low cost. In next generation networks, users will move between these different networks. They want to maintain their ongoing communications while using the best available connection. These heterogeneous networks {{may or may not}} belong to the same service provider. Hence, support for smooth handoff between networks of different service providers is required. In this work, we describe the design of a new architecture, namely SeSMo, for fast handoff in heterogeneous environments. Our proposal introduces the use of an intelligent handoff decision mechanism for the discovery and the prediction of future access routers (ARs) and the generation of new session keys. Our architecture has the following characteristics:• Scalable: It should be able to integrate any number of wireless systems of both existing and future service providers. • Transparency to heterogeneous access technologies: The architecture should be transparent to different access technologies of different networks. • Secure: The architecture should be able to provide secure vertical and horizontal handoff. • Seamless mobility support to eliminate connection interruption and QoS degradation during <b>intersystem</b> <b>handoff...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to investigate and develop an efficient and seamless data transport protocol for a heterogeneous wireless mobile network. In next-generation network, most of heterogeneous wireless mobile networks will be combined and complementarily constitute a hierarchical network. To integrate different networks, many challenging issues should be solved. In this thesis, an efficient and seamless data transport mechanisms are explored. We investigate the problems that the current transport control protocol (TCP) will experience within the heterogeneous mobile network. In a heterogeneous network, a mobile host experiences drastic changes in network condition during a session. Traditional TCP struggles with abrupt network changes by <b>intersystem</b> <b>handoff</b> and cannot work efficiently in this environment. We propose a TCP scheme to be tailored to the heterogeneous mobile network to support seamless data transport. In the proposed scheme, a TCP is informed the impending handoff events and works differently based on a handoff type. Simulation results present the proposed algorithm improves throughput, stabilizes data transmission rapidly, and provides a seamless data transfer. We also propose an adaptive resource management scheme within a 3 G cellular network based on a users priority level to reduce the call dropping and blocking rates. In a heterogeneous network, a network that provides smaller bandwidth may struggle with handed-off calls being served with a higher bandwidth. Therefore, a resource management algorithm should be defined so that an ongoing call is not dropped by a handoff and provides seamless data transfer. We propose an adaptive resource management scheme based on downgrading the quality of some existing services in a 3 G cellular network. We analyze the system capacity, call blocking rate and call dropping rate of the proposed algorithm, and simulate the performance variation of the downgraded traffic. The results show that the proposed scheme increases system capacity, and decreases the call dropping rate at the cost of small delay of the downgraded data traffic. Ph. D.

40|$|Abstract — In the {{integrated}} next-generation wireless systems (NGWS), users are always {{connected to the}} best available networks and switch between different networks based on their service needs. It is an important and challenging issue to support seamless handoff management in NGWS. The objective {{of this paper is}} to develop a seamless handoff management protocol for NGWS. In this work, a fuzzy logic-based adaptive handoff (FLAH) management protocol is developed which is then integrated with an existing cross layer handoff protocol. Afterward, the handoff performance comparison of the existing protocol and our proposed protocol is carried out. The simulation results exhibit that, proposed fuzzy logic-based handoff management protocol has much better performance than conventional protocols for both intra and <b>intersystem</b> <b>handoffs...</b>|$|R
40|$|Next-generation {{wireless}} systems (NGWS) integrate different wireless networks, each {{of which}} is optimized for some specific services such as WLANs, WiMAX, General Packet Radio Service (GPRS) and Universal Mobile Telecommunications System (UMTS). The most important and challenging issue is seamless handoff management in NGWS to ensure the Quality of Service (QoS). In this paper, we propose a handoff management architecture using signal to interference ratio of the present and neighboring base stations. This handoff management scheme uses mobile’s speed, handoff signaling delay information and also the size of the present and neighboring cell to enhance the handoff performance. In our proposed work we use the signal to interferenceratio threshold values between present base station in which the mobile terminal is served and its neighboring stations. The simulation results show that our proposed mechanism supports mobility management in wireless IP networks and significantly enhances the handoff performance for both intra and <b>intersystem</b> <b>handoffs</b> reducing false handoff initiation and unnecessary call blocking probability...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—The {{integration}} of third-generation (3 G) cellular networks and IEEE 802. 16 e networks {{is an important}} inter-working case within the forthcoming fourth-generation hetero-geneous wireless networks. In this paper, we extend the virtual partitioning with preemption technique for admission control in cellular/ 802. 16 e interworking and evaluate its performance. First, we describe the mobility scenario between 3 G cellular net-works and IEEE 802. 16 e networks {{in terms of the}} horizontal (intrasystem) and vertical (<b>intersystem)</b> <b>handoffs</b> that can occur and derive the corresponding handoff rate equations. We then propose admission-control algorithms for connection requests that consider the class of service (i. e., real time or nonreal time) and the type of user (i. e., new or handoff). For the handoff requests, a different priority is assigned to each type of handoff. A joint connection- and packet-level optimization approach is used for quality-of-service (QoS) provisioning. The accuracy of the an-alytical model is validated via simulations. Numerical results show significant performance improvement. The blocking probabilities for new connection requests can be reduced by 70 % when the joint QoS optimization approach is used.
