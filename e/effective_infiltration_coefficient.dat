40|$|To {{assess the}} mean annual {{groundwater}} recharge of the karst aquifers in southern Apennines (Italy), {{the estimation of}} the mean annual <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> (AEIC) was conducted {{by means of an}} integrated approach based on hydrogeological, hydrological, geomorphological, land use and soil cover analyses. We studied {{a large part of the}} southern Apennines that is covered by a meteorological network and containing 40 principal karst aquifers. Using precipitation and air temperature time series gathered through monitoring stations operating in the period 1926 – 2012, the annual effective precipitation (AEP) was estimated, and its distribution was modelled, by considering the orographic barrier and rain shadow effects of the Apennines chain, as well as the altitudinal control. Four sample karst aquifers with available long spring discharge time series were identified for estimating the AEIC by means of the hydrological budget equation. The resulting AEIC values were correlated with other parameters that control groundwater recharge, such as the extension of outcropping karst-rock, morphological settings, land use and covering soil type. A simple correlation relationship between AEIC, lithology and the summit flat and endorheic areas was found. This empirical model has been used to estimate AEIC and mean annual groundwater recharge in other regional karst aquifers. The estimated AEIC values ranged between 48 % and 78 %, thus matching intervals estimated for other karst aquifers in European and Mediterranean countries. These results represent a deeper understanding of an aspect of groundwater hydrology in karst aquifers which is fundamental for the formulation of appropriate management models of groundwater resources, also taking into account mitigation strategies for climate change impacts. Finally, the proposed hydrological characterisations are also perceived as useful for the assessment of mean annual runoff over carbonate mountains, which is another important topic concerning water management in the southern Apennines...|$|E
40|$|International audienceAssessing the {{groundwater}} recharge can represent a challenge {{due to the}} generally limited knowledge about infiltration processes, interaction with surface water or between aquifers, available data and pumping impact on it. Using different methods to estimate recharge is recommended in order to integrate uncertainties.

A gridded water budget approach has been developed to compute at the daily time step, {{the groundwater}} recharge by precipitation at the regional scale of the south of France. Independent water budget approaches are compared between them and with the SURFEX land surface modelling results to assess the uncertainty associated to the effective rainfall parameterization method. A distributed parameter (IDPR) related to the drainage density and which accounts for hydrological connectivity have been calibrated to provide the gridded <b>effective</b> rainfall <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> necessary for recharge estimation.

40|$|A hydrogeological {{study was}} carried out on {{important}} fractured/karst aquifer systems located in the Versilia River basin (Tuscany, Italy), in order to optimize the groundwater resources management. The main aim was the individuation of the feeding areas {{of the most important}} springs by means of a multidisciplinary approach using geological, hydrogeological and geochemical-isotopic tools. Some hydrogeological sections were elaborated in order to define the geometry of the main hydrostructures and to individuate possible groundwater divides. The elaboration of geochemical data allowed at identifying 3 main chemical facies: Ca-HCO 3, Ca-SO 4 and Na-Cl. The first two highlight the interaction of water with limestone/dolostone and carbonate-evaporite rocks for a time sufficient to acquire these chemical compositions and to achieve saturation/supersaturation in calcite and dolomite. The Na-Cl groundwater shows low salinity and a composition similar to rainwater, indicating a circulation in rocks containing minerals not very reactive and/or short interaction time with carbonate rocks. These two main types of water-rock interaction are confirmed by the isotopic ratio δ 13 C: for the Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-SO 4 types, δ 13 C value requires a significant contribution of carbon derived from dissolution of calcite, while for Na-Cl water, δ 13 C values are consistent with the addition of biogenic CO 2 in rainwater. Stable water isotopes (δ 18 O and δ 2 H) confirm that groundwaters have a meteoric origin and that the wide range of values essentially depends on the different average altitude of feeding zone. Comparing the geological and hydrogeological features with the results of the geochemical processing, {{it is reasonable to assume}} that: the Na-Cl springs are representative of the superficial circuits, with small feeding zones and very low residence times in aquifer; whereas the Ca-HCO 3 and Ca-SO 4 springs are representative of relatively deep circuits developed in extensive aquifers with high permeability. The first type of springs was used to obtain the relationship between the δ 18 O ratio and the altitude of rainwater infiltration. Taking into account that they drain a small basin and considering the regulator effect of the aquifers, the isotopic composition of these springs are very similar to the annual average isotopic values of the local meteoric water. This relationship was used to evaluate the average altitude of the feeding area of the second type of springs. All these elements, and some tracer test results available in literature, allowed us to delimit the hydrogeological basins likely drained by the most important springs under study. In addition, for each hydrogeological system, a simplified water balance using meteorological data and the <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients</b> reported in the literature was performed, verifying that the delimited catchment areas are entirely consistent with the flow rate data of the springs...|$|R
40|$|Current design {{methods for}} {{sustainable}} drainage system infiltration devices, such as soakaways, permeable pavements and infiltration basins, require {{knowledge of the}} empirical soil <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> as determined using a soakage test procedure. However, the control that seasonal antecedent hydrological conditions, specifically unsaturated zone soil moisture and water table position, have on the <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> is uncertain. This paper uses exploratory numerical modelling to investigate this uncertainty.

40|$|The {{evaluation}} of the active recharge of karst aquifers is an important tool to estimate the groundwater resource availability in these complex hydrogeological systems, characterized by spatial and temporal variability of many hydrogeological factors, involved in groundwater flow. As a matter of fact, the rate of recharge is a key aspect for sustainable exploitation and management of these groundwater resources, as they represent {{one of the most}} important fresh-water supplies for human life and economic activities. This paper presents the results of the inverse hydrogeological water budget method application in the karst aquifer feeding Pertuso Spring, Central Italy, to evaluate the average annual groundwater recharge (i. e. the <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration),</b> supported by an open source GIS. This carbonate aquifer is {{one of the most important}} of Central Italy and Pertuso Spring is the main outlet of this karst system with an average rate of about 1. 7 m 3 /s. The study area lies in the Upper Valley of the Aniene River, in the south-east part of Latium Region, and is spread for about 50 km 2. Calculation of the <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> was based on mean annual rainfall data, collected over 20 years (1992 - 2012), evapotranspiration and on hydrogeological settings of outcropping rocks, used for setting up potential <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients.</b> The inverse hydrogeological water balance has been applied to the study area, discretized in grid cells (EFQ), 6. 25 Ha each one. The results of the inverse hydrogeological water balance method applied to the karst aquifer feeding Pertuso Spring show an annual recharge of about 45 Mm 3 /year. The <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> map shows that the highest values are related to the presence of karstified Cretaceous limestone, mainly outcropping in the north-east part of the basin. On the contrary, lower values of <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> are generally due to the lower permeability, which characterizes the rest of the area (Triassic crystal dolomites, pudding stones and conglomerates). Results show that the annual active recharge of this karst aquifer (45 Mm 3 /year) is greater than the depletion volume of water coming from Pertuso Spring (25 Mm 3 /year). The {{evaluation of}} the active recharge is a useful tool to identify the priority protection measures for sustainable land use planning and groundwater management in the study area...|$|R
40|$|Current UK {{guidance}} {{for the design}} of sustainable drainage systems recommends that infiltration devices, such as soakaways, permeable pavements and infiltration basins, should be able to operate during periods of extreme groundwater level. Furthermore, higher groundwater levels have recently been shown to cause a reduction in the empirical soil <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient,</b> as used in the design of infiltration devices. However, there is currently no simple method available to estimate the required reduction in the design <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> to account for an extreme groundwater level. This paper uses exploratory numerical sub-surface saturated-unsaturated hydrological modelling to quantify the effect of groundwater level on the <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> for six typical soil types. The fixed resolution finite element simulations are also benchmarked against a solution employing adaptive mesh refinement. The modelling results are distilled into charts and a simple equation to allow the calculation of adjustment factors, with which to reduce the design <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> to account for a higher design groundwater level. Varying soil type sensitivity is highlighted. These factors could also be used to correct for soakage tests made during periods of lower groundwater level.

40|$|The spatial {{variability}} of the <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> parameter within the recharge {{areas of the}} main aquifer complexes of the hydrogeological group of the Umbria-Marche ridge of Central Italy was assessed. This parameter usually varies with respect to lithology {{and the extent of}} precipitation in the investigated area. The average <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration,</b> expressed in millimeters/year, was directly computed by dividing the volume of water discharged on average from a hydrogeological basin by the extent of its recharge area. This method does not directly depend on the extent of precipitation, and therefore it is not biased by uncertainty in that value. <b>Effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> was assessed for 15 hydrogeological units and ranges from 200 mm/year to 475 mm/year. The <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> values for the "Scaglia" complex are always lower than those of the other aquifer complexes. The <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> of the "Scaglia" complex increases southwards. This latitudinal spatial variation of <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> is nearly independent of the precipitation distribution. Because this trend is much more pronounced in the "Scaglia" complex, it has been inferred that the {{spatial variability}} of the "Scaglia" fracturing is more significant than fracturing in any of the other calcareous lithotypes. The recharge area of the "Scaglia" complex is higher in the northern hydrostructures than in the southern structures because the two areas have different deformation styles. When added to the spatial fracture variability in the "Scaglia", the effects of this differentiation in deformation are responsible for the different water resource amount of the hydrostructures. The occurrence of wide outcrops of the "Scaglia" complex with reduced infiltration capability justifies the existence of less productive aquifers in the northern hydrostructures...|$|R

40|$|The paper {{deals with}} the {{defining}} and estimating the hydrogeologic components of the runoff relatively to three Appenninic mountainous watersheds in Northern Tuscany (Italy). The closing of the groundwater budget equation and the estimate of the <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> are supported by the data of groundwater drainage from tunnels bored for the High Speed railway connection between Florence and Bologna. The comparison between the surface hydrological regime of springs and creeks, the discharge monitoring of the tunnel and the effects on the environmental flows of the forced drainage, has put in evidence either a higher than expected value of the <b>coefficient</b> of <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration,</b> considered as the ratio between <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> in the watershed and effective rainfall, or {{the importance of the}} interflow in the determination of the runoff coming out from the watershed.

In the paper a methodology to estimate the dynamic resource from the analysis of the recession curve of creeks and springs and to derive the environmental flow of a creek, both with the availability of few discharge data, is presented.

The indoor PM 2, 5 concentration is measured with an optical particle counter. The hourly outdoor concentration is derived from an outdoor station of an air quality monitoring network.

To document this issue, rainfall simulation experiments were carried out on 37 undisturbed 1 -m 2 plots located along a pedo-climatic transect across West Africa. An important part of the variability of <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> (R 2 = 0. 71) could be explained by a simple model based on the position of rock fragments in the top layer and accounting for the areal percentages of three types of soil surface : (1) bare surface, (2) soil surface covered with rock fragments embedded in the soil surface, and (3) surface with rock fragments resting on top of the soil surface. An even higher determination coefficient (R 2 = 0. 76) was gained when rock fragment size were accounted for in combination with vesicular porosity. Furthermore, a positive linear relationship was obtained between <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> and mean annual rainfall suggesting that additional factors related to climate might be involved, including organic matter content and clay mineralogy. Two main regions could thus be differentiated. In the arid and semi-arid zones, coarse gravel and cobbles embedded in a seal are predominant and generate high runoff. Conversely, fine and medium gravel, mainly free at soil surface, are dominant in the wetter zone, favouring therefore higher infiltration rate. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R

Farm studies carried out in a clay-loam soil in Karaj. The two management treatments were soil without wheat residual and soil with wheat residual by a 5 ton/ha rate.

Finally, dimensionless parameter such as Z* were developed to predicate Z parameter in different irrigation time, irrigation events and different residual management. Base on the result, although residue management causes a significant difference between value of f 0 and Z in two treatments, but it doesn’t effect on trend of variation during the season. It means that the trend of variation is independent of residue in soil.

Due to the related so-called 'ponding time', the overall model results in a switched partial differential equation, coupled with an ordinary differential one. In this model, the initial state, the friction <b>coefficient</b> and the <b>infiltration</b> parameters {{are assumed to be}} unknown, with only a discrete number of measurements being available. For the estimation, the model is modified by adding an activation function, and then used in the minimization of a cost function defined as thedifference between available measurements and the corresponding simulated ones. The variational analysis isapplied on the augmented Lagrangian objective functional {{in order to get the}} weak form of gradients of this function with respect to the variables to be estimated. Based on these gradients a quasi Newton method is used to solve the optimization problem. An illustration example is finally provided to validate the proposed approach...|$|R
40|$|Hydrology {{often takes}} an {{important}} {{place in the}} domain of hydraulic structures management, and is a key component of many hydraulic studies. Modelling the main hydrological processes requires a particular attention {{in order to deal with}} problems in an optimal way. Instrumented basins studies has pointed out the considerable impact of the sewer system on the hydrological outputs dynamics on small basins, even poorly urbanized. The current models often take into account the distributed impervious areas by adapting the corresponding surfaces runoff or <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficients.</b> This approach, which is suited to produce correct runoff volumes, is however unable to represent the real flow outputs dynamics in which important variations can occur with a hourly time step. Modelling this flow component is essential to catch the rapidly-varying flow inputs generated by the runoff on drained impervious areas. An efficient modelling method has therefore been developed to include the sewer system in a global hydrological model (WOLF), using accurate landuse data in vector format and available data on the sewage system. These developments have been successfully tested on the Berwinne basin, Belgium. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|The {{measured}} {{diffusion coefficient}} and soil-water characteristic curve (SWCC) of remolded loess {{were used to}} modify the Mualem model for increasing its accuracy. The obtained {{results show that the}} goodness of fit between the Mualem model and the variable parameter-modified Mualem method comparing with the test results was not high. The saturation of 0. 65 was introduced as the boundary to divide the curve of the measured diffusion coefficient into two segments. When the segmentation method combined with the variable parameter method was used to modify the Mualem model, the fitting correlation coefficient was increased to 0. 921 – 0. 998. The modified parameters Ko and L corresponding to remolded loess were calculated for different dry densities. Based on the exponential function between Ko and dry density and the linear relation between L and dry density, the segmentally modified Mualem model was established for remolded loess by considering variation in dry density. The results of the study can be used for directly determining the unsaturated <b>infiltration</b> <b>coefficient</b> and for indirectly determining the SWCC through diffusion coefficient...|$|R
40|$|This {{study is}} {{conducted}} {{to find out}} correlation between released groundwater volume and groundwater level and salinity degradation {{as well as to}} find <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> holes formation for groundwater augmentation. It belongs to field experimental research. This study concludes some concerns, they are: (1) Groundwater condition in farm land of coastal area in Takalar Regency has undergone salinization and groundwater salinity escalation in every groundwater release is very high. Groundwater release volume is directly proportional to groundwater salinity escalation with relatively high rate on its escalation gradient; (2) Total degradation of groundwater level in coastal farm land ranges from 14 to 15 cm, and it is relatively low compared to total occurred degradation of groundwater level in observed inner land in early year (ranging from 100 to 150 cm); (3) Number of infiltration hole significantly affects escalation volume of augmentation and groundwater salinity rate degradation...|$|R

The geological {{setting of}} the area has been defined reconstructing the morphology of roof of prevolcanic substratum and the geometry of the aquifers by the realization of cartographies made of several profiles to different scales. The project of hydrogeological surveying of wells, springs and discharge’s streams have been led to define the state of conservation of water resources. The results of this research have underlined a distributed and relevant drawdown of ground water table and of river capacity network. Specific studies, supported by cartographies elaborated by GIS, have been led to define all the parameters concerning the hydrogeological balance: precipitation, evapotranspiration, runoff, <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration,</b> withdrawals. The analysis of the hydrogeological balance, {{have led to a}} definition of specific rules for the management of water resources in order to recover the situations of over-exploitation...|$|R
40|$|About 50 % of the {{territory}} of the Cilento and Vallo di Diano GeoPark consists of carbonate aquifers which correspond to the mountainous areas in the park (e. g. M. ti Alburni, M. te Cervati, M. te Bulgheria etc.). The rocks of these carbonate aquifers are mainly dolomites (Triassic-Liassic) and limestones (Jurassic). The abundance of groundwater resources in these aquifers is due to many factors: high permeability, the high altitudes that the mountains reach (with its important weather contribution), the absence of significant impermeable layers and the many tectonic-karst depressions. All this means a) that <b>effective</b> <b>infiltration</b> is significant and b) that it is not split into several groundwater bodies distributed at different heights a. s. l. but combines to feed basal ground water resources. The groundwater of these carbonate karst aquifers are therefore the main waters supplied for the populations of Cilento region and strategic water-resources to socio-economic and environmental development for the GeoPark...|$|R
