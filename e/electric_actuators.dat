40|$|The {{purpose of}} this master thesis is to {{investigate}} the possibility to refine the control system of turbochargers in petrol engines by introducing turbo speed measurement. This thesis also investigates possible control enhancement from an <b>electric</b> wastegate <b>actuator</b> compared with a traditional pneumatic actuator. During the thesis work the control problem is divided into 3 sub systems: boost pressure controller, turbo speed controller, and <b>electric</b> <b>actuator</b> controller. The design procedure of the controllers follows model-based method in which a simulation model for engine and a simulation model for <b>electric</b> <b>actuator</b> are used. The designed controller is then implemented and evaluated in an engine test cell. The result of the thesis work shows that the <b>electric</b> wastegate <b>actuator</b> is preferred as it delivers consistent actuation speed and accurate positioning which favours model-based design that requires exact wastegate position. Although the purposed controller structure that uses turbo speed measurement cannot yet achieve faster generation of boost pressure {{by the end of}} the thesis work, the use of turbo speed sensor as controller feedback still shows potential to enhance the boost controller and ease the controller design, as the turbo speed measurement can reflect the boost pressure faster and is less sensitive to the disturbances in the air flow...|$|R

50|$|Hydraulic and <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> {{have a very}} rigid {{behavior}} and can only be made {{to act in a}} compliant manner through the use of relatively complex feedback control strategies. While electric coreless motor actuators are better suited for high speed and low load applications, hydraulic ones operate well at low speed and high load applications.|$|E
50|$|Hydraulic or <b>electric</b> <b>actuators</b> add {{controlled}} {{energy to}} the steering mechanism, so the driver can provide less effort to turn the steered wheels when driving at typical speeds, and reduce considerably the physical effort necessary to turn the wheels when a vehicle is stopped or moving slowly. Power steering can also be engineered to provide some artificial feedback of forces acting on the steered wheels.|$|E
50|$|An <b>electric</b> <b>actuator</b> {{is powered}} by a motor that {{converts}} electrical energy into mechanical torque. The electrical energy is used to actuate equipment such as multi-turn valves. It is one of the cleanest and most readily available forms of actuator because it does not directly involve oil or other fossil fuels.|$|R

50|$|Due to {{increasing}} decentralisation {{in automation technology}} {{and the introduction of}} micro processors, more and more functions have been transferred from the DCS to the field devices. The data volume to be transmitted was reduced accordingly, in particular by the introduction of fieldbus technology. <b>Electric</b> <b>actuators</b> whose functions have been considerably expanded are also affected by this development.The simplest example is the position control. Modern positioners are equipped with self-adaptation i.e. the positioning behaviour is monitored and continuously optimised via controller parameters.|$|E

25|$|Ball {{bearings}} {{designed to}} support high speeds and temperatures are sometimes {{used instead of}} fluid bearings to support the turbine shaft.

50|$|The {{history of}} control loading systems {{starts with the}} history of flight simulation. The first flight {{simulator}} was the Link Trainer, also known as the Blue Box. This was developed in the 1920s and used pumps, valves and bellows to provide the flight control forces. The next development in control loading systems was the use of hydraulic actuators to provide the forces required on the flight controls. These were utilized for around 20 years in the simulator industry until the development of <b>electric</b> <b>actuators.</b>|$|E
