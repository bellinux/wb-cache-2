500|$|M.I.A.'s music {{features}} styles such as electro, reggae, {{rhythm and}} blues, alternative rock, hip hop, grime, rap ballads and Asian folk and references to her musical influences such as Missy Elliott, Tamil film music, Lou Reed, the Pixies, Timbaland, the Beastie Boys and London Posse. She was a childhood fan of Boney M, composer A. R. Rahman and pop artists Michael Jackson and Madonna, also she has cited Björk as an inspiration {{and has been}} influenced by The Slits, Public Enemy, Malcolm McLaren and The Clash. Noting her early inspirations, she said [...] "When I would go to bed, I’d {{listen to the radio}} and dream about dancing and Paula Abdul and Whitney Houston, and that’s how <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> When my radio was burgled, I started listening to hip hop". She has revealed her ideal karaoke song would be [...] "Germ-Free Adolescents" [...] by X-Ray Spex. M.I.A. describes her music as dance music or club music for the [...] "other", and has been described as an [...] "anti-popstar" [...] for refusing to conform to certain recording industry expectations of solo artists. M.I.A. possesses the vocal range of a mezzo-soprano, [...] M.I.A.'s early compositions relied heavily on the Roland MC-505, while later M.I.A. experimented further with her established sound and drew from a range of genres, creating layered textures of instruments, electronics and sounds outside the traditional studio environment. [...] Nas, Chuck D and Krist Novoselic of Nirvana have praised her work.|$|E
2500|$|Although Orange Man was {{produced}} in 1991, it is not believed to have aired on British television until 1992 on television channels such as ITV and Channel 4, where it became the first advertisement in the [...] "You Know When You've Been Tango'd" [...] campaign, which would continue until 1996 before being revived from 2002–2005. Orange Man was an instant success; Robinson recalled in 2015 that [...] "I first knew the ad was huge when <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> on the London Underground one evening. I woke up to hear {{a group of kids}} talking about and mimicking it. I wanted to go up and say: 'I did that!'" ...|$|E
2500|$|In the {{aftermath}} of their father's death, their mother would slip into a deep depression and {{spend a lot of}} time in bed. In an effort to cheer her up, Ullman, along with her sister, created and performed a nightly variety show on the windowsill in their mother's bedroom. “It was originally the Patti Ullman Show. So I’m a spin-off of my sister’s show, as she likes to point out.” In the show, Ullman would mimic neighbours, teachers, family members, and celebrities such as Julie Andrews and Édith Piaf. [...] "Some kids can play the piano or kick a football; I could just impersonate everyone." [...] She would also perform alone for herself after everyone had gone to bed. [...] "I'd stand in front of the mirror and talk to myself until <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> I'd interview myself as women with problems. Women in documentaries who had three kids and chain-smoked and husbands in prison that hit them." [...] Her mother would eventually remarry to a man who Ullman has described as a maniac who drove a London taxi and had a son who stole. [...] "We weren't the Brady Bunch, let me tell you!" [...] The marriage brought an end to the children's late night antics. [...] "There was a new person in her bed now and I couldn't do my nightly performance anymore. I was nine years old and my show had been cancelled." [...] Alcoholism and domestic violence became a common occurrence in the household. The marriage also resulted in the family moving around the country, with Ullman attending numerous state schools. Her flair for mimicry helped with the transitions as her new classmates didn't take to her upper crust accent. [...] "I had to talk like them to avoid being beaten up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'It {{is a mere}} nothing,' said Nicholas, {{returning}} to Mrs Kenwigs; 'the little girl, who was watching the child, being tired <b>I</b> suppose, <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> and set her hair on fire.' ...|$|R
60|$|Although I {{could still}} hear the wind blowing {{strongly}} outside, I too was glad that its force had diminished so far that we felt no more the violent jerking that had disturbed us, and <b>I</b> soon <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|R
60|$|We halted out on {{the ridge}} and {{dismounted}} for the usual little rest. Mine I took {{in the shade of}} a scrubby mesquite. The girls strolled away out of sight. It was a drowsy day, and <b>I</b> nearly <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|R
60|$|I was {{arranging}} {{my plans}} most carefully, when <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> from absolute exhaustion.|$|E
60|$|After a peep {{through the}} open window, <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> feeling once more at home.|$|E
60|$|But here <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> for my {{editorial}} duties had {{not been}} light that day.|$|E
6000|$|... "There {{was still}} a good supply of rum, and I took a swig at the bottle, and then, whether because of the cold or the rum, I don't know, but <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> sound <b>asleep</b> {{in front of the}} blaze.|$|R
60|$|I promised, of course; and {{we kissed}} one another {{over and over}} again, and <b>I</b> soon <b>fell</b> fast <b>asleep.</b>|$|R
60|$|So {{long did}} we wait that <b>I</b> almost <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> resting {{against the cold}} marble, but was {{suddenly}} aroused by hearing Curtis give a quick catching breath. Then from far away there came a little sound as though the statues that lined the walls were whispering to each other some message of the ages.|$|R
60|$|I {{seemed to}} be probing the very deeps of being, but indeed imperceptibly <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> and sat dreaming.|$|E
60|$|He did {{not answer}} me, but went away; and soon, {{in spite of all}} my doubts and fears, <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
60|$|Regarding him I had {{no further}} anxiety, and, without being aware that slumber was {{weighing}} heavily upon my eyelids, <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
6000|$|I {{gave the}} matter no further consideration, and at my usual hour retired to bed. Here, having placed a candle upon a reading {{stand at the}} bed head, and having made an attempt to peruse some pages of the [...] "Omnipresence of the Deity," [...] <b>I</b> {{unfortunately}} <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> in less than twenty seconds, leaving the light burning as it was.|$|R
60|$|Exhausted by my sufferings, <b>I</b> now <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> but {{was soon}} wakened by loud cries of anguish uttered at no great distance. I started to my feet, and beheld an {{extraordinary}} spectacle, which at once {{assured me that}} I had fallen among natives of the worst and lowest type. The dark places of the earth are, indeed, full of horrid cruelty.|$|R
60|$|It {{goes without}} saying that I promised to keep in mind all she had said, striving in so far as lay within my power to do what she desired. Then, {{following}} Hiram's example, for mother had promised to waken us near to ten of the clock; I went into the chamber where, despite all of excitement which was in my mind, <b>I</b> speedily <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> {{by the side of the}} widow's son.|$|R
6000|$|... "I heard {{just such}} singing before <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> {{the night after}} that party at Madame Uccelli's, and it filled me with fury." ...|$|E
60|$|But {{the amazing}} thing is that, {{whenever}} it was or was not that <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> I woke up to find myself in Germany.|$|E
60|$|For then, so {{insidious}} was the music, and {{not quite}} of this earth the voice, my senses altogether forsook me, and <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
60|$|And in {{this fashion}} I {{continued}} {{to learn to be}} an electrician. Night after night <b>I</b> limped home, <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> before <b>I</b> could eat my supper, and was helped into bed and undressed. Morning after morning, always with huger lunches in my dinner pail, I limped out of the house on my way to work.|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> soon <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> before Wemmick's fire, and the Aged and I enjoyed one another's {{society by}} falling asleep before it {{more or less}} all day. We had loin of pork for dinner, and greens grown on the estate; and I nodded at the Aged with a good {{intention}} whenever I failed to do it drowsily. When it was quite dark, I left the Aged preparing the fire for toast; and I inferred {{from the number of}} teacups, as well as from his glances at the two little doors in the wall, that Miss Skiffins was expected.|$|R
6000|$|Mr. Kenwigs rushed out, and was met at {{the door}} of the bedroom by a young man with the baby (upside down) in his arms, who came out so quickly that he knocked Mr. Kenwigs down; handing the child to his mother, he said, [...] "Don't be alarmed, it's all out, it's all over--the little girl, being tired, <b>I</b> suppose, <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> and set her hair on fire. I heard her cries and ran up in time to prevent her setting fire to {{anything}} else. The child is not hurt: I took it off the bed myself and brought it here to convince you." ...|$|R
60|$|About {{four o'clock}} <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> I slept for some hours, {{and would have}} {{continued}} doing so had not a wild cry suddenly brought me to my feet.|$|E
60|$|We reached Chicago in time {{to catch}} the night train at ten o'clock, and in almost utter mental {{exhaustion}} <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> about midnight, and slept till nearly daylight.|$|E
6000|$|... "'I was boiling {{the kettle}} when <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> sir.' He {{looked at me}} and then up at the still quivering bell with an ever-growing astonishment upon his face.|$|E
60|$|But finally I {{was forced}} to sleep. Tired nature would be put off no longer. <b>I</b> simply <b>fell</b> <b>asleep,</b> willy nilly, as I sat looking out to sea. I had been very uncomfortable since my ducking in the ocean, for though I could see the {{sunlight}} on the water half-way toward the island and upon the island itself, no ray of it fell upon us. We were well within the Land of Awful Shadow. A perpetual half-warmth pervaded the atmosphere, but clothing was slow in drying, and so from loss of sleep and great physical discomfort, I at last gave way to nature's demands and sank into profound slumber.|$|R
60|$|Thus refreshed, I walked again up the street, {{which by}} this time had many clean-dressed people in it, who were all walking the same way. I joined them, and thereby was led into the great meeting-house of the Quakers near the market. I sat down among them, and, after looking round awhile and hearing nothing said, being very drowsy thro' labor and want of rest the {{preceding}} night, <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> fast <b>asleep,</b> and continued so till the meeting broke up, when one {{was kind enough to}} rouse me. This was, therefore, the first house I was in, or slept in, in Philadelphia.|$|R
60|$|I {{wrote that}} last entry five days ago, late at night, after {{coming back from}} Casa Salsi. <b>I</b> {{afterwards}} <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> in my chair; the night was half over when I woke up. Instead of going to bed, I stood a long time at the window, {{looking out at the}} river. It was a warm, still night, and the first faint streaks of sunrise were in the sky. Presently I heard a slow footstep beneath my window, and looking down, made out by the aid of a street lamp that Stanmer was but just coming home. I called to him to come to my rooms, and, after an interval, he made his appearance.|$|R
60|$|So relentlessly did {{my partner}} and I spring into our work {{throughout}} the week that by Saturday night we were frazzled wrecks. I found myself in the old familiar work-beast condition, toiling longer hours than the horses toiled, thinking scarcely more frequent thoughts than horses think. The books were closed to me. I had brought a trunkful to the laundry, but found myself unable to read them. <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> the moment I tried to read; and if I did manage to keep my eyes open for several pages, I could not remember the contents of those pages. I gave over attempts on heavy study, such as jurisprudence, political economy, and biology, and tried lighter stuff, such as history. <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> I tried literature, and fell asleep. And finally, when <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> over lively novels, I gave up. I never succeeded in reading one book {{in all the time}} I spent in the laundry.|$|E
6000|$|... 'Yes,' he said, {{with a faint}} smile, 'it was {{the same}} when I was quite a baby, and crawled about it, till <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b> My father watched it then.' ...|$|E
60|$|I pondered {{over this}} as I dined in solitary state; and when I had mounted my funeral pyre for the night, I {{remember}} romancing {{about it as}} <b>I</b> <b>fell</b> <b>asleep.</b>|$|E
60|$|Books I tried, {{both those}} of the little {{circulating}} library, and of the more rational subscription collection maintained by this intellectual people. But neither the light reading of the one, nor the heavy artillery of the other, suited my purpose. <b>I</b> always <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> at {{the fourth or fifth}} page of history or disquisition; and it took me a month's hard reading to wade through a half-bound trashy novel, during which I was pestered with applications to return the volumes, by every half-bred milliner's miss about the place. In short, during the time when all the town besides had something to do, I had nothing for it, but to walk in the church-yard, and whistle till it was dinner-time.|$|R
60|$|It was {{a custom}} at my friend's {{to retire at}} an early hour on Saturday evening, in order {{that there might be}} {{abundant}} time for rest, and no excuse for late rising on the Sabbath; and, accordingly, when the children had done singing, after a short season of family devotion, we all betook ourselves to our chambers, and <b>I,</b> for one, <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> with the impression of having finished the week most agreeably, and with anticipations of very great pleasure on the morrow.|$|R
6000|$|... 'Eve's wisdom,' said Elizabeth, 'the {{knowledge}} of evil, {{and the wisdom}} of vanity and vexation of spirit. But was it not curious, Anne? when first I woke, before I had opened my eyes, those words were sounding in my ears, like a dream of Papa's voice, reading the Lesson at church; <b>I</b> almost <b>fell</b> <b>asleep</b> again, and again those words came back in Papa's voice, and then I woke entirely, and before I had seen what kind of day it was, before I knew whether it was Saturday or Sunday, I was sure there was something wrong, {{and then there was}} all this black Mechanics' Institute business before me. And all through this day those words have been ringing in my ears, and coming upon me like the pressure of King James's iron belt.' ...|$|R
