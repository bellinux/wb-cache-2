5|$|Herrerasaurus {{was named}} by {{paleontologist}} Osvaldo Reig after Victorino Herrera, an Andean <b>goatherd</b> who first noticed its fossils in outcrops {{near the city}} of San Juan in 1959. These rocks, which later yielded Eoraptor, are part of the Ischigualasto Formation and date from the late Ladinian to early Carnian stages of the Late Triassic period. Reig named a second dinosaur from these rocks in the same publication as Herrerasaurus; this dinosaur, Ischisaurus cattoi, is now considered a junior synonym and a juvenile of Herrerasaurus.|$|E
5|$|The Bourbon Spanish, meanwhile, were {{planning}} {{to carry out a}} surprise attack. Simón Susarte, a Spanish <b>goatherd</b> who had fled Gibraltar after its capture by Rooke a few months earlier, told Villadarias that there was a secret route by which {{the east side of the}} Rock of Gibraltar could be scaled. It required a climb of around , of which the upper section was near-vertical, but was passable with the use of rope and ladders via the Great Sand Dune. As the east side was considered virtually impregnable, only the west side was fortified; if the Rock could be climbed from the east, an attacker could evade the fortifications and descend directly into the town. The route was reconnoitred and found to be passable by a lightly armed force.|$|E

25|$|The Dalai Lama lineage {{started from}} humble beginnings. 'Pema Dorje' (1391–1474), {{the boy who}} was {{to become the first}} in the line, was born in a cattle pen in Shabtod, Tsang in 1391. His nomad parents kept sheep and goats and lived in tents. When his father died in 1398 his mother was unable to support the young <b>goatherd</b> so she {{entrusted}} him to his uncle, a monk at Narthang, a major Kadampa monastery near Shigatse, for education as a Buddhist monk. Narthang ran the largest printing press in Tibet and its celebrated library attracted scholars and adepts from far and wide, so Pema Dorje received an education beyond the norm at the time as well as exposure to diverse spiritual schools and ideas. He studied Buddhist philosophy extensively and in 1405, ordained by Narthang's abbot, he took the name of Gendun Drup. Soon recognised as an exceptionally gifted pupil, the abbot tutored him personally and took special interest in his progress. In 12 years he passed the 12 grades of monkhood and took the highest vows. After completing his intensive studies at Narthang he left to continue at specialist monasteries in Central Tibet, his grounding at Narthang was revered among many he encountered.|$|E
500|$|Although they {{appeared}} in print later, Philip Sidney's three sestinas {{may have been}} written earlier, and are often credited as the first in English. The first published (toward the end of Book I of The Countess of Pembroke's Arcadia, 1590) is the double sestina [...] "Ye <b>Goatherd</b> Gods". In this variant the standard end-word pattern is repeated for twelve stanzas, ending with a three-line envoi, resulting in a poem of 75 lines. Two others were published in subsequent editions of the Arcadia. The second, [...] "Since wailing is a bud of causeful sorrow", is in the [...] "standard" [...] form. Like [...] "Ye <b>Goatherd</b> Gods" [...] it is written in unrhymed iambic pentameter and uses exclusively feminine endings, reflecting the Italian endecasillabo. The third, [...] "Farewell, O sun, Arcadia's clearest light", is the first rhyming sestina in English: it is in iambic pentameters and follows the standard end-word scheme, but rhymes ababcc in the first stanza (the rhyme scheme necessarily changes in each subsequent stanza, a consequence {{of which is that}} the 6th stanza is in rhyming couplets). Sidney uses the same envoi structure as Spenser. William Drummond of Hawthornden published two sestinas (which he called [...] "sextains") in 1616, which copy the form of Sidney's rhyming sestina. After this, there is an absence of notable sestinas for over 250 years, with John Frederick Nims noting that, [...] "...there is not a single sestina in the three volumes of the Oxford anthologies that cover the seventeenth, eighteenth and nineteenth centuries." ...|$|E
500|$|Paul Mazursky's 1982 modern-language {{adaptation}} of The Tempest, with Philip Dimitrius (Prospero) as a disillusioned New York architect who retreats to a lonely Greek island {{with his daughter}} Miranda after learning of his wife Antonia's infidelity with Alonzo, dealt frankly with the sexual tensions of the characters' isolated existence. The Caliban character, the <b>goatherd</b> Kalibanos, asks Philip which of them {{is going to have}} sex with Miranda. John Cassavetes played Philip, Raul Julia Kalibanos, Gena Rowlands Antonia and Molly Ringwald Miranda. Susan Sarandon plays the Ariel character, Philip's frequently bored girlfriend Aretha. The film has been criticised as [...] "overlong and rambling", but also praised for its good humour, especially in a sequence in which Kalibanos' and his goats dance to Kander and Ebb's New York, New York.|$|E
5000|$|The {{dance of}} the chivarrudos recalls that tasks {{performed}} cowboys herding, <b>goatherds</b> and foremen of the cattle ranches of Tlaxcala {{in the late nineteenth}} and early twentieth centuries. This dance spans several municipalities in the south of the state, as Zacatelco, Xicohtzinco and Quiletla, which has more than a century practiced. Your name [...] "CHIVARRUDOS" [...] comes from his tanned which are obtained from the skins of goats, which are placed as chaps to dance giving off a scent, like say a lot: [...] "a guy" [...] and that few can bear to be near they. These men personify dressed <b>goatherds,</b> cowboys, wranglers, laborers, foremen and riders caregivers of farm animals, including goats and goats were and running from north to south through the fields at the end of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries.|$|R

500|$|The sestina {{has been}} subject to some variations, with changes being made to both the size and number of stanzas, and also to {{individual}} line length. A [...] "double sestina" [...] is the name given to either: two sets of six six-line stanzas, with a three-line envoy (for a total of 75 lines), or twelve twelve-line stanzas, with a six-line envoy (for a total of 150 lines). Examples of either variation are rare; [...] "Ye <b>Goatherd</b> Gods" [...] by Philip Sidney is a notable example of the former variation, while [...] "The Complaint of Lisa" [...] by Algernon Charles Swinburne is a notable example of the latter variation. In the former variation, the original pattern of line-ending words, i.e. that of the first stanza, recurs in the seventh stanza, and thus the entire change of pattern occurs twice throughout. In the second variation, the pattern of line-ending words returns to the starting sequence in the eleventh stanza; thus it does not, unlike the [...] "single" [...] sestina, allow for every end-word to occupy each of the stanza ends; end-words 5 and 10 fail to couple between stanzas.|$|E

Captain Fisher of the Marines with 17 of his men successfully defended the Round Tower against their assault.
