50|$|It was {{established}} in 1926 in Mirano (Venice), where the first store was opened. In 1962 it opened its flagship store in Milan at Piazza 5 Giornate. Coin was the first retailer to develop a <b>fidelity</b> <b>card</b> program in Italy in 1986.|$|E
40|$|International audienceThe {{feasibility}} {{of using a}} retailer <b>fidelity</b> <b>card</b> scheme to estimate food additive intake has been investigated in an earlier study. <b>Fidelity</b> <b>card</b> survey information was combined with {{information provided by the}} retailer on levels of the food colour Sunset Yellow (E 110) in the foods to estimate a daily exposure to the additive in the Swiss population. As with any dietary exposure method the <b>fidelity</b> <b>card</b> scheme is subject to uncertainties and in this paper the impact of uncertainties associated with input variables including amounts of food purchased, levels of E 110 in food, proportion of food purchased at retailer, rate of <b>fidelity</b> <b>card</b> usage, proportion of foods consumed outside of home and bodyweights and with systematic uncertainties has been assessed using a qualitative, deterministic and probabilistic approach. An analysis of the sensitivity of the results to each of the probabilistic inputs was also undertaken. The analysis was able to identify the key factors responsible for uncertainty within the model and demonstrate how the application of some simple probabilistic approaches can be used to quantitatively assess uncertainty...|$|E
40|$|This article {{provides}} distributional results for testing multiple outliers in regression. Because direct simulation of each combination of number of observations {{and number of}} parameters is too time consuming, three straightforward methods using truncated simple samples are described for approximating the pointwise distribution of the test statistic. Scaling factors are found to adjust {{for the number of}} parameters. The same simulations also provide a powerful method of calibrating pointwise inferences for simultaneous tests for an unknown number of outliers. Analysis of data on <b>fidelity</b> <b>cards</b> reveals an unexpected group of outliers...|$|R
40|$|Loyalty cards, {{thanks to}} the {{electronic}} support they use, produce a massive amount of data that - at least potentially - allow Brands, and Distributors to identify masses of people like never before. In combination with the scanner, the card is {{a powerful tool for}} consumer knowledge. The fidelity programs enable micro marketing strategies to be implemented in relation to the businesses growing orientation to recognize, measure and exploit customer diversity to target actions in to different target segments with the aim of retention, extention and acquisition. Issuing of cards (often preceded by the completion of an application form and a questionnaire) and their use (which determines the registration of purchases of goods and services) involves processing personal data of customers and sometimes Their family members. For the proper use of personal information by the companies issuing <b>fidelity</b> <b>cards,</b> the Privacy Guard has set some guidelines for loyalty programs with a provision of 24 February 2005 ("Fidelity cards for consumer protection"). The Italian press has given great resonance to the guarantor's tightness on fidelity programs, talking about a Great Brother of <b>fidelity</b> <b>cards.</b> Nonetheless, there is a US Consumer Protection Against Supermarket Privacy Invasion and Numbering (CASPIAN) opinion group, which is a spokesperson for discomfort regarding the indiscriminate use of customer data. But are we really in an Orwelian scenario, as it is represented by our media? Our thesis is that no, we are not. We are not for a few, simple reasons: 1. Poor applicability of Consumer Relationship Management and Micro Marketing due to high consumer costs. 2. Privacy protection reduces the revenue gained from micromarketing 3. Analyzes are always aggregated, involving large clusters, large number...|$|R
40|$|This paper aims at {{investigating}} {{the impact on}} Italian Serie A attendance of the urgent antiviolence measures adopted by the Italian government in 2007 (decree n. 8 of 8 th February 2007, successively converted by law 4 th April 2007). These urgent measures were forced by the public opinion {{after the death of}} the agent Filippo Raciti (2 nd February 2007) during clashes before the Sicilian derby between Catania and Palermo. The purpose was to force back the overexcited committed fans and attract the uncommitted part previously deterred by soccer violence. Using data on match attendance during the championships 2008 / 09 and 2009 / 10, when the <b>fidelity</b> fan <b>card</b> was introduced and admittance restrictions adopted, the paper tests if the expected substitution effect between committed and uncommitted fans was effective. Results show that the different measures adopted by Comitato per la Sicurezza delle Manifestazioni Sportive (CASMS) and by the Osservatorio Nazionale delle Manifestazioni Sportive (ONMS) reduced the stadium attendance from a minimum of 1. 600 to a maximum of 1. 900 tickets sold. From this perspective the <b>fidelity</b> fan <b>card</b> can not be considered a successful measure (it {{has not been able to}} invert the negative trend of stadium attendance in Serie A of the last three decades.

30|$|Then {{we would}} like to extend the methodological {{framework}} in order to test the predictive power of the temporal profile by predicting when the next shopping will take place and how much will be the amount spent. Finally, in collaboration with UniCoop Tirreno, {{we would like}} to implement a web dashboard where a customer can provide her <b>fidelity</b> <b>card</b> number and visualize the patterns forming her temporal purchasing profile.|$|E
40|$|Research {{into the}} use of Location Based Services (LBS) that can {{pinpoint}} {{the exact location of}} users using wireless networks is the fastest growing area in Information Technology (IT) today. This is because of the need to transform the radio waves which act as a wireless networks data’s transmission medium into a private location. Contemporary research on LBS suggests that indoor location can be difficult as the geo positional satellites (GPS) cannot give an accurate positional computation due to insulation provided by physical barriers like the walls and furniture of a house. Previous research however suggests a way around this by making use of wireless <b>fidelity</b> (WiFi) <b>cards</b> signal strength but acknowledges limitations on the range which doesn’t exceed 50 meters. Other researchers have suggested that using LBS technology would allow hackers to track the user’s movement over time and so proposed that the user identity be kept secret by disposing the identifiers. Against this backdrop, some researchers have championed the call for a framework in LBS privacy in order to curtail the security risks that come with using wireless networks and suggested using a transactionbased wireless communication system in which transactions were unlinkable. This would in effect camouflage the movement of users as their location {{would not be able to}} be tracked. This paper aims to review contemporary issues on location based privacy in wireless technology and proposes a model for optimising LBS privacy and describes the initial stages of a research project aimed at filling the research void through the application of a hybrid research methodolog...|$|R
