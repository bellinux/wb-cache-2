5|$|Early {{experiments}} with radiolabelled systemin in tomato demonstrated {{that it is}} transported through the phloem sap in tomato plants and was therefore {{thought to be the}} systemic signal that activated systemic acquired resistance. This view was challenged by grafting experiments which showed that mutants deficient in <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> biosynthesis and perception were unable to activate systemic acquired resistance. It is now thought that <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> is the systemic signal and that systemin upregulates the pathways for <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> synthesis.|$|E
5|$|Within {{minutes of}} systemin perception, the cytosolic Ca2+ {{concentration}} increases, and linolenic acid is released from cell membranes after a phospholipase has been activated. Linolenic acid is then converted to <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> via the octadecanoid pathway and <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> activates defensive genes. Production of methyl jasmonate is induced by systemins and also upregulates systemin precursor genes creating a feedback loop, amplifying the defensive signal. Methyl jasmonate is volatile and can therefore activate {{systemic acquired resistance}} in neighbouring plants, preparing their defences for attack. These signalling events are analogous to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. When the inflammatory response is activated in animals, MAPKs are activated which in turn activate phospholipases. Lipids in the membrane are converted to arachidonic acid and then to prostaglandins, which are analogs of <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid.</b> Both pathways can be inhibited by suramin.|$|E
5|$|Although the receptors for systemins and HypSys remain poorly understood, we have {{a better}} {{understanding}} of the signal transduction that occurs once the peptide had bound to its receptor. <b>Jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> is an essential, albeit late component, in the systemin and wound-signalling pathways. In tomato, the signal is transduced from the receptor by mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs). Cosilencing of two MAPKs, MPK1 and MPK2, in tomato compromised their defence response against insect larvae compared to wild type plants. Cosilencing these genes also decreased production of <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> and of jasmonic acid-dependent defence genes. Applying methyl jasmonate to cosilenced plants rescued them, indicating that jasmonates are the signal responsible for causing changes in gene expression. The alkalisation of the apoplast is a downstream effect of signalling processing by MAPKs. Applying fusicoccin, which activates the H+ ATPase inhibited by systemin, along with systemin still activates MAPKs, even though the pH of the apoplast does not change.|$|E

30|$|Plant growth-promoting Bacilli, like FZB 42, {{are able}} to {{propagate}} in the rhizosphere, the soil environment influenced by plant roots. This environment is highly competitive due to the nutrient-rich rhizodeposits consisting {{of a wide variety}} of compounds derived from sloughed off root cells and tissues, mucilages, and soluble exudates originating from intact roots [6]. However, roots respond to signals that stimulate defense responses (salicylic and <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acids)</b> by exuding a range of secondary metabolites, such as saponins, glucosinolates, hydroxamic acids, and naphthoquinones, which are inhibiting the growth of many ‘ordinary’ (not adapted to plant colonization) bacteria or fungi in this area.|$|R
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the involvement of}} phytohormones during rice microspore/pollen (MS/POL) development, endogenous levels of IAA, gibberellins (GAs), cytokinins (CKs) and abscisic acid (ABA) in the mature anther were analyzed. We also analyzed the global expression profi les of genes related to seven phytohormones, namely auxin, GAs, CKs, brassinosteroids, ethylene, ABA and <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acids,</b> in MS/POL and tapetum (TAP) using a 44 K microarray combined with a laser microdissection technique (LM-array analysis). IAA and GA 4 accumulated in a much higher amount in the mature anther compared with the other tissues, while CKs and ABA did not.

5|$|Tomato plants over-expressing systemin {{produced}} more {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) than normal plants and parasitoid wasps found them more attractive. Systemin also upregulates the expression of genes involved {{in the production of}} biologically active VOCs. Such a response is crucial if antinutritional defences are to be effective, since without predators, developing insects would consume more plant material while completing their development. It is likely that VOC production is upregulated through different pathways, including oxylipin pathway that synthesises <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> aldehydes and alcohols that function in wound healing.|$|E
5|$|Overexpression of systemin and HypSys {{has been}} found to improve plants' {{tolerance}} to abiotic stress, including salt stress and UV radiation. When prosystemin was over-expressed in tomato, transgenic plants had lower stomatal conductance than normal plants. When grown in salt solutions, transgenic plants had higher stomatal conductances, lower leaf concentrations of abscisic acid and proline and a higher biomass. These findings suggest that systemin either allowed the plants to adapt to salt stress more efficiently or that they perceived a less stressful environment. Similarly, wounded tomato plants were less susceptible to salt stress than unwounded plants. This may be because wounding decreases the growth of the plant and therefore slows the uptake of toxic ions into the roots. An analysis of salt-induced changes in gene expression found that the differences measured between the transgenic and normal plants could not be accounted for by changes in conventional salt stress-induced pathways. Instead Orsini et al. suggested that the activation of the <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> pathway determines a physiological state that not only directs resources towards the production of compounds active against pests, but also pre-adapts plants to minimize water loss. These effects are achieved by negatively regulating the production of hormones and metabolites that will force plants to invest additional resources to counteract water loss, a secondary effect of herbivores.|$|E
5|$|Systemin is a plant {{peptide hormone}} {{involved}} in the wound response in the Solanaceae family. It was the first plant hormone that was {{proven to be a}} peptide having been isolated from tomato leaves in 1991 by a group led by Clarence A. Ryan. Since then other peptides, with similar functions have been identified in tomato and outside of the Solanaceae. Hydroxyproline-rich glycopeptides were found in tobacco in 2001 and AtPEPs (Arabidopsis thaliana Plant Elicitor Peptides) were found in Arabidopsis thaliana in 2006. Their precursors are found both in the cytoplasm and cell walls of plant cells, upon insect damage, the precursors are processed to produce one or more mature peptides. The receptor for systemin was first thought to be the same as the brassinolide receptor but this is now uncertain. The signal transduction processes that occur after the peptides bind are similar to the cytokine-mediated inflammatory immune response in animals. Early experiments showed that systemin travelled around the plant after insects had damaged the plant, activating systemic acquired resistance, now it is thought that it increases the production of <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> causing the same result. The main function of systemins is to coordinate defensive responses against insect herbivores but they also affect plant development. Systemin induces the production of protease inhibitors which protect against insect herbivores, other peptides activate defensins and modify root growth. They have also been shown to affect plants' responses to salt stress and UV radiation. AtPEPs have been shown to affect resistance against oomycetes and may allow A. thaliana to distinguish between different pathogens. In Nicotiana attenuata, some of the peptides have stopped being involved in defensive roles and instead affect flower morphology.|$|E
40|$|Among various contaminants, ozone (O 3) is {{considered}} the most ubiquitous and phytotoxic atmospheric pollutant in industrialized and developing countries. It causes extensive risks for plant life, in terms of survival and productivity of wild and cultivated species. Plant response to O 3 resembles the biotic defense reactions and includes two steps: {{the first is a}} biphasic oxidative burst with a massive, rapid, and transient increase in apoplastic reactive oxygen species (ROS) production; the second is the induction of the hypersensitive response (HR) and systemic acquired resistance (SAR). In particular, the acute O 3 exposure (high concentrations for a few hours) results in the activation of programmed cell death (PCD) response that interacts with the synthesis of several hormones and other signaling molecules. The cross talk among all these molecules and their complex and interconnected signaling pathways are more important to determine (1) the initiation, propagation, and containment of O 3 -induced cell death, (2) the degree of the sensitivity of plants to this contaminant, and (3) the regulatory potential that plants have to promptly respond to oxidative stress. The present chapter reviews the role of phytohormones (such as ethylene, abscisic acid, gibberellins, auxins, and cytokinins) and other signaling molecules (such as salicylic and <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acids,</b> proline, and brassinosteroids), as well as their synergistic and antagonistic effects, in the complex signaling pathway involved in plant responses to O 3 stress...|$|R
40|$|The {{expression}} and secretion of acid phosphatase (APase) {{was investigated in}} Indian mustard (Brassica juncea L. Czern.) plants using sensitive in vitro and activity gel assays. Phosphorus (P) starvation induced two APases in Indian mustard roots, only {{one of which was}} secreted. Northern-blot analysis indicated transcriptional regulation of APase expression. Polymerase chain reaction and Southern-blot analyses revealed two APase homologs in Indian mustard, whereas in Arabidopsis, only one APase homolog was detected. The Arabidopsis APase promoter region was cloned and fused to the β-glucuronidase (GUS) and green fluorescent protein (GFP) reporter genes. GUS expression was first evident in leaves of the P-starved Arabidopsis plants. In P-starved roots, the expression of GUS initiated in lateral root meristems followed by generalized expression throughout the root. GUS expression diminished with the addition of P to the medium. Expression of GFP in P-starved roots also initiated in the lateral root meristems and the recombinant GFP with the APase signal peptide was secreted by the roots into the medium. The APase promoter was specifically activated by low P levels. The removal of other essential elements or the addition of salicylic or <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acids,</b> known inducers of gene expression, did not activate the APase promoter. This novel APase promoter may be used as a plant-inducible gene expression system for the production of recombinant proteins and as a tool to study P metabolism in plants...|$|R
40|$|We {{previously}} identified rutin as part {{of potato}} root responses to its pathogen Verticillium dahliae. Rutin was directly toxic to the pathogen at doses greater than 160 μM, a threshold below which many V. dahliae pathogenicity-related genes were up-regulated. We identified and characterized a cupin domain-containing protein (VdQase) with a dioxygenase activity and a potential role in V. dahliae-potato interactions. The pathogenicity of VdQase knock-out mutants generated through Agrobacterium tumefasciens-mediated transformation was significantly reduced on susceptible potato cultivar Kennebec compared to wild type isolates. Fluorescence microscopy revealed a higher accumulation of flavonols in the stems of infected potatoes and a higher concentration of rutin in the leaves {{in response to the}} VdQase mutants as compared to wild type isolates. This, along with the HPLC characterization of high residual and non-utilized quercetin in presence of the knockout mutants, indicates the involvement of VdQase in the catabolism of quercetin and possibly other flavonols in planta. Quantification of Salicylic and <b>Jasmonic</b> <b>Acids</b> (SA, JA) in response to the mutants versus wild type isolates revealed involvement of VdQase in the interference with signaling, suggesting a role in pathogenicity. It is hypothesized that the by-product of dioxygenation 2 -protocatechuoylphloroglucinolcarboxylic acid, after dissociating into phloroglucinol and protocatechuoyl moieties, becomes a starting point for benzoic acid and SA, thereby interfering with the JA pathway and affecting the interaction outcome. These events may be key factors for V. dahliae in countering potato defenses and becoming notorious in the rhizosphere...|$|R

25|$|Since the {{beginning}} of the biotechnology revolution, much research has been also focused on using genetically modified endophytes to improve plant yields and defensive properties. The genetic basis of response to herbivory is being explored in tall fescue, where it appears the production of <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acid</b> {{may play a role in}} downregulation of the host plant’s chemical defense pathways when a fungal endophyte is present. In some cases, fungi that are closely associated with their hosts have transferred genes for secondary metabolite production to the host genome, which could help to explain multiple origins of chemical defenses within the phylogeny of various groups of plants. This represents an important line of inquiry to pursue, especially in regards to understanding the chemical pathways that can be utilized in biotechnological applications.|$|E
40|$|The {{study of}} the {{biochemical}} and molecular mechanisms involved in the host-pathogen-antagonist interaction is essential to understand {{the dynamics of the}} infectious processes and can be useful for the development of new strategies to control phytopathogens, particularly viruses, against which chemical treatments have no effect. In this work, we demonstrate {{for the first time the}} antiviral activity of the rizospheric fungus Trichoderma harzianum strain T- 22 (T 22) against Cucumber mosaic virus (CMV) strain Fny. The molecular and biochemical aspects of the interaction between strain T 22 and the tomato plant against CMV are discussed. A particular emphasis has been given on the substances and genes implicated in the plant defense pathways, such as reactive oxygen species (ROS), genes encoding antioxidant enzymes (Cu/Zn-SOD, Mn-SOD, CAT 1, CAT 2 and APX), and phytohormones responsible for mediating defense responses (salicylic and <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acids).</b> Interestingly, histochemical and morphological analysis revealed an increase in O 2 •- and H 2 O 2 levels in all the leaf of the plants infected by CMV, indicating the involvement of ROS in plant defense responses. Gene expression analysis (q-PCR) pointed out a clear increase of the oxidative stress in all the plants treated with T 22 after the inoculation with CMV. Finally, gene expression analysis of the Coi- 1 gene seems to show the activation of a defense response similar to the systemic acquired resistance. The analysis of the results obtained suggests the possible use of T 22 as a treatment rather than as a preventive measure...|$|R
40|$|Selection and {{breeding}} of rootstocks that can tolerate low K supply may increase crop productivity in low fertility soils and reduce fertilizer application. However, the underlying physiological traits are still largely unknown. In this study, 16 contrasting recombinant inbred lines (RILs) {{derived from a}} cross between domestic and wild tomato species (Solanum lycopersicum × Solanum pimpinellifolium) {{have been used to}} analyse traits related to the rootstock-mediated induction of low (L, low shoot fresh weight) or high (H, high shoot fresh weight) vigor to a commercial F 1 hybrid grown under control (6 mM, c) and low-K (1 mM, k). Based on hormonal and ionomic composition in the root xylem sap and the leaf nutritional status after long-term (7 weeks) exposure low-K supply, a model can be proposed to explain the rootstocks effects on shoot performance with the ethylene precursor aminocyclopropane- 1 -carboxylic acid (ACC) playing a pivotal negative role. The concentration of this hormone was higher in the low-vigor Lc and Lk rootstocks under both conditions, increased in the sensitive HcLk plants under low-K while it was reduced in the high-vigor Hk ones. Low ACC levels would promote the transport of K vs. Na in the vigorous Hk grafted plants. Along with K, Ca, and S, micronutrient uptake and transport were also activated in the tolerant Hk combinations under low-K. Additionally, an interconversion of trans-zeatin into trans-zeatin riboside would contribute to decrease ACC in the tolerant LcHk plants. The high vigor induced by the Hk plants can also be explained by an interaction of ACC with other hormones (cytokinins and salicylic, abscisic and <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acids).</b> Therefore, Hk rootstocks convert an elite tomato F 1 cultivar into a (micro) nutrient-efficient phenotype, improving growth under reduced K fertilization.

40|$|Vanilla is {{a commercially}} {{valuable}} plant that produces vanillin, an aromatic compound that {{is widely used}} in cosmetics, foods, beverages and pharmaceutics. The high demand of vanilla {{is caused by the}} difficult propagation of 'hand-pollination' method that is hard labor and time consuming. The objective {{of this study was to}} determine the effect of gamma radiation and methyl jasmonate on the regeneration of vanilla tissue culture and its chemical constituents. The tissue culture technique started with sterilization method by using different combinations of fungicide, alcohol and commercial bleach. Then, the vanilla explants undergone gamma radiation (0 Gy, 10 Gy, 20 Gy, 30 Gy) and planted in different concentrations of methyl jasmonate (0 μM, 10 μM, 20 μM, 40 μM, 80 μM). The ten weeks vanilla cultures were harvested and their shoot height, leaf number, root length and root number were measured and analyzed using ANOVA (SPSS 18). Then the vanilla explants were oven dried at 40 °C, ground and soaked in methanol for 48 hours. GC-MS analysis was done to the ten vanilla cultures with highest shoot length. The results showed that 1 % fungicide, 10 % commercial bleach and 70 % alcohol were the best combination to sterilize vanilla explants without harming the explants. The gamma radiation results showed that 10 Gy gamma irradiated vanilla culture had the highest regeneration of vanilla, shoot height was 13. 40 ± 0. 33 cm, while 30 Gy gamma irradiated cultures showed the lowest. Ten Gy gamma irradiated culture be higher regeneration in 20 μM methyl jasmonate, shoot height of 14. 5 ± 0. 4 cm, compared to other methyl jasmonate concentrations. This may due to the enhancement of photosynthesis and metabolites that was promoted by gamma ray and <b>jasmonic</b> <b>acids</b> inside the mesophyll cells of vanilla explants. The GC-MS analysis showed higher production of acetovanillone and ethyl vanillyl methyl, derivatives of vanillin in 10 Gy irradiated cultures as well as other metabolites such as phenols, fatty acids and siloxanes. A higher methyl jasmonates also stimulated the production of phytochemicals in vanilla explants. In conclusion, a low gamma radiation and methyl jasmonate concentration promote the regeneration of vanilla in plant tissue culture and induced the secondary metabolite within the plants...|$|R

In this thesis, the analyses of four genes involved in the regulation of development of rice grain and floret are presented. Two CCCH type zinc finger proteins, OsGZF 1 and OsGZF 2, were identified as novel transcription factors for GluB- 1, {{one of the major}} seed-storage protein genes. Both of them exhibited negative effects on the GluB- 1 promoter in transient expression assays. In a collection of rice mutants, two Tos 17 transposon lines were identified showing open-staying florets and abnormal seed development. The mutant gene was identified as OsJAR 1 and was shown to encode a <b>jasmonic</b> acid-amino <b>acid</b> synthetase. Next, we identified the potassium antiporter OsCHX 14 as one of the downstream genes of OsJAR 1. Yeast complementation assays confirmed that OsCHX 14 is capable of effluxing K+ outside of cells.

40|$|Chitosan is {{a natural}} polymer with {{applications}} in agriculture, which causes plasma membrane permeabilisation and induction of intracellular reactive oxygen species (ROS) in plants. Chitosan has been mostly applied in the phylloplane to control plant diseases and to enhance plant defences, but has also been considered for controlling root pests. However, the effect of chitosan on roots is virtually unknown. In this work, we show that chitosan interfered with auxin homeostasis in Arabidopsis roots, promoting a 2 - 3 fold accumulation of indole acetic acid (IAA). We observed chitosan dose-dependent alterations of auxin synthesis, transport and signalling in Arabidopsis roots. As a consequence, high doses of chitosan reduce WOX 5 expression in the root apical meristem and arrest root growth. Chitosan also propitiates accumulation of salicylic (SA) and <b>jasmonic</b> (JA) <b>acids</b> in Arabidopsis roots by induction of genes involved in their biosynthesis and signalling. In addition, high-dose chitosan irrigation of tomato and barley plants also arrests root development.

The ABA and strigolactones act in mature leaf cells however, by pushing out minerals, water, sugar, gases and even the growth hormones auxin and cytokinin (and possibly <b>jasmonic</b> and salicylic <b>acid</b> in addition). This causes even more ABA and strigolactones to be made until the leaf is drained of all nutrients.

In both genotypes the O(3) -induced ET emission peaked after 3 h of fumigation, although with different intensities between them; H(2) O(2) and NO bursts occurred, both showing a biphasic time course. However, SA and JA revealed opposite accumulation patterns: in Nr a high level of SA but a low JA accumulation were observed, whereas in WT a marked evolution of JA but a weak SA accumulation were detected. The transcription of certain JA-biosynthetic and HR-inducible genes was similarly activated by O(3) in the two tomato lines. According to the current models on the molecular events leading to the development of O(3) -induced foliar symptoms, here we suggest that the partial ET-insensitivity of Nr would have promoted a SA build-up, leading to cell death and to a reduced JA accumulation.

Abstract: Previously, we generated potato transformants expressing Agrobacterium-derived auxin synthesis gene tms 1 driven by tuber-specific patatin gene promoter (B 33 -promoter). Here, we studied the endogenous hormonal {{status and the}} response to exogenous phytohormones in tms 1 transformants cultured in vitro. Adding indole- 3 -acetic acid (IAA) or kinetin to culture medium affected differently tuberization of tms 1 -transformed and control plants, depending also on sucrose content in the medium. Exogenous phytohormones ceased to stimulate the tuber initiation in transformants at high (5 – 8 %) sucrose concentration, while in control plants the stimulation was observed in all experimental settings. Furthermore, exogenous auxin partly inhibited the tuber initiation, and exogenous cytokinin reduced the average tuber weight in most transformants at high sucrose content. The elevated auxin level in tubers of the transformants was accompanied with a decrease in content of cytokinin bases and their ribosides in tubers and most shoots. No concerted changes in contents of abscisic, <b>jasmonic,</b> salicylic <b>acids</b> and gibberellins in tubers were detected. The data on hormonal status indicated that the enhanced productivity of tms 1 transformants was due to auxin and not mediated by other phytohormones. In addition, exogenous cytokinin was shown to upregulate the expression of genes encoding orthologs of auxin receptors. Overall, {{the results showed that}} tms 1 expression and local increase in IAA level in transformants affect both the balance of endogenous cytokinins and the dynamics of tuberization in response to exogenous hormones (auxin, cytokinin), the latter reaction depending also on the carbohydrate supply.

Our study revealed biomarkers for systemic signaling in response to wounding and compatible virus infection in Arabidopsis, which should prove useful in further addressing the trigger-specific systemic response network and the elusive systemic signals. We observed responses common to ORMV and mock treatment as well as protein profile changes that are specific to local virus infection or mechanical wounding (mock treatment) alone, which provides evidence {{for the existence of}} more than one systemic signal to induce these distinct changes. Comparison of the systemic responses between time points indicated that the responses build up over time. Our data indicate stress-specific changes in proteins involved in <b>jasmonic</b> and abscisic <b>acid</b> signaling, intracellular transport, compartmentalization of enzyme activities, protein folding and synthesis, and energy and carbohydrate metabolism. In addition, a virus-triggered systemic signal appears to suppress antiviral host defense...|$|R
40|$|Tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) genes {{regulated}} {{during the}} early stage of responses to wounding were screened by a modified fluorescence differential display method. Among 28 genes initially identified, a particular clone designated NtC 7 was subjected to further analysis. Its transcripts were found to accumulate rapidly and transiently within 1 h upon treatments with not only wounding but also salt and osmotic stresses. However, <b>jasmonic</b> and abscisic <b>acids</b> and ethylene did not effectively induce NtC 7 transcripts. Amino acid sequence analysis suggested NtC 7 {{to be a new}} type of transmembrane protein that belongs to the receptor-like protein family, and a membrane location was confirmed in onion (Allium cepa) epidermis cells transiently expressing an NtC 7 -green fluorescent protein fusion protein. Seeds of transgenic tobacco overexpressing NtC 7 normally germinated and grew in the presence of 500 mm mannitol, but not in the presence of 220 mm sodium chloride or 60 mm lithium chloride. Cuttings of mature transgenic leaf exhibited a marked tolerance upon treatment with 500 mm mannitol for 12 h, at which concentration wild-type counterparts were seriously damaged. These results suggested that NtC 7 predominantly functions in maintenance of osmotic adjustment independently of ion homeostasis...|$|R
