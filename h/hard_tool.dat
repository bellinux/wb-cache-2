50|$|Inconel is a {{difficult}} metal to shape and machine using traditional techniques due to rapid work hardening. After the first machining pass, work hardening tends to plastically deform either the workpiece or the tool on subsequent passes. For this reason, age-hardened Inconels such as 718 are machined using an aggressive but slow cut with a <b>hard</b> <b>tool,</b> minimizing the number of passes required. Alternatively, {{the majority of the}} machining can be performed with the workpiece in a solutionized form, with only the final steps being performed after age hardening.|$|E

Modern devices can be stamped, cut on a milling machine or with a CNC machine. In the case of stamping, the master has the precision built into itself and the stamped device is as accurate as the stamping process allows. Similarly, molding of plastic can be as precise as the mold process. With proper concern for such effects as thermal expansion or contraction and shrinkage, the precision can be very high.|$|E
50|$|Wiley mill {{refers to}} a {{specific}} group of grinding mills manufactured under the name Thomas Scientific. The term Wiley {{as it relates to}} cuttingand/orgrinding mills is a registered trademark of Arthur H. Thomas Company. These mills prepare materials for analysis with minimal moisture loss. Well-dried samples are preferred. In the grinding mill, the material is loaded cut into crude pieces or lumps and loaded into a hopper. From the hopper, the material drops by gravity into the path of a set of revolving <b>hard</b> <b>tool</b> steel blades driven by an electric motor. The revolving knives work against stationary knives and the resulting powder is forced through a steel screen. The powdered material then drops into a waiting collection vessel underneath.|$|E
50|$|Creating a cast {{urethane}} {{master pattern}} {{is different from}} the steps involved in creating hard tooling for injection molding. Hard tools for injection molding are going to be subjected to a lot of stress and heat during the injection process. They will see runs of thousands of parts per day. The care that goes into a <b>hard</b> <b>tool</b> involves intense machine programming which costs thousands of dollars alone. The price for hard tooling is balanced by the mass production the tooling brings, which is where cast urethanes begin to differ. Cast urethanes are suited for smaller runs of parts and prototyping. Because the cost for soft tooling is lower, down in the hundreds rather than hundreds of thousands, cast urethanes are excellent resources for creators still testing product design, for one-off products, or for testing market and consumer response to a new product.|$|E

5000|$|Incremental {{analysis}} has filled the role previously completed {{through the use}} of proof tools or prototype tools. Proof tools in the past were short run dies made of softer than normal material, which were used to plan and test the metal forming operations. This process was very time consuming and did not always yield beneficial results, as the soft tools were very different in their behavior than the longer running production tools. Lessons learned on the soft tools did not transfer to the <b>hard</b> <b>tool</b> designs. Simulation has for the most part displaced this old method. Simulation used as a virtual tryout is a metal forming simulation based on a specific set of input variables, sometimes nominal, best case, worst case, etc. However, any simulation {{is only as good as}} the data used to generate the predicitions. When a simulation is seen as a [...] "passing result" [...] manufacturing of the tool will often begin in earnest. But if the simulation results are based on an unrealistic set of production inputs then its value as an engineering tool is suspect.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{addresses}} computer {{numerical control}} (CNC) polishing of aspheric or freeform optics. Prior CNC grinding of the asphere tends to produce mid-spatial frequencies (MSFs) at some level. Precessions polishing can rectify these, but the very ability of the bonnet tooling {{to adapt to the}} local asphere enables it to do so, at least in part, to similar spatial frequencies in the MSFs. To accelerate smoothing, <b>hard</b> <b>tools</b> can, in principle, be used, but aspheric misfit is often assumed to preclude this. In this paper, we explore new insight into the role of abrasive particle size in accommodating misfit. First, we report on a glass-bending rig to produce a continuous range of complex surfaces, while withstanding process forces. Then, we describe how this was used to evaluate the triangle of misfit, abrasive size, and MSFs produced for <b>hard</b> rotating <b>tools.</b> This has revealed a regime in which such tools can be used without introducing significant new MSFs, as evidenced by manufacture of prototype off-axis aspheric segments for the European Extremely Large Telescope project...|$|R

40|$|Hybrid moulds are a novel {{approach}} for rapid tooling of injection moulds that combines conventional machining for the mould structure and rapid prototyping techniques for the moulding blocks (core and cavity). In this study, two routes were used for producing the moulding blocks: selective laser sintering of stainless steel-based powder (<b>hard</b> <b>tool)</b> and epoxy resin vacuum casting (soft tool). The experimental work {{was based on a}} complex tridimensional commercial part. Themouldings were made in polypropylene, and the processing performance was monitored online in terms of pressure and temperature at the impression. The performance of the moulding blocks was analysed in terms of thermal and cycle performance and structural integrity. The epoxy tooling route is more adequate for fine detailing than selective laser sintering but is not adequate for parts with extensive ribs or deep bosses. The structural integrity of the less costly epoxy composite can be compromised during ejection, this suggesting the need to evaluate the stress field by simulation at the design stage of the mould.

50|$|Tempering is {{a process}} of heat treating, which is used to {{increase}} the toughness of iron-based alloys. Tempering is usually performed after hardening, to reduce some of the excess hardness, and is done by heating the metal to some temperature below the critical point for a certain period of time, then allowing it to cool in still air. The exact temperature determines the amount of hardness removed, and depends on both the specific composition of the alloy and on the desired properties in the finished product. For instance, very <b>hard</b> <b>tools</b> are often tempered at low temperatures, while springs are tempered to much higher temperatures.|$|R

40|$|Metal Matrix Composites (MMC) {{are very}} {{interesting}} materials for {{applications in the}} automotive and aerospace fields, since they combine the lightness of Aluminium with {{the strength of the}} ceramic reinforcement.

However very <b>hard</b> <b>tool</b> materials will need to be chosen in order to overcome the problem of heavy abrasive tool wear. In this work the wear behaviour of coated and uncoated steel tools has been investigated in the Friction Stir Processing of extruded bars in A 359 + 20 %SiC. AISI 1040 steel was used as the tool material in the hardened uncoated and annealed and coated versions. In the latter case the steel was coated with multilayer PVD AlSiCrN or AlSiTiN.

40|$|A wear {{resistant}} {{metal matrix composite}} with a <b>hard</b> <b>tool</b> steel matrix and titanium carbides (TiCs) as reinforcing particles was produced {{on the surface of}} a plain carbon steel, using the technique of plasma transferred arc alloying. An almost uniform alloyed layer free of cracks and porosities having a thickness of 0. 8 - 1. 0 mm and a hardness of 850 - 900 HV was achieved. The microstructure consists of a matrix of martensite and residual austenite and primary TiC (MC) carbides as reinforcing particles. Pin-on-disk tests using an alumina counterbody with applied loads in the range of 9. 8 - 39. 2 N and sliding speeds between 15 and 75 cm/s were conducted and the wear rate was found of the order of 10 -s mm(3) /m. For the lowest sliding speeds of 15 and 30 cm/s the wear rate is proportional to the applied load over the whole range of loads and the dominating wear mechanism is plastic deformation. At sliding speeds of 55 and 75 cm/s the dominating wear mechanism is oxidation and a transition from mild to severe oxidational wear occurs when the applied load exceeds a value lying between 29. 4 and 39. 2 N. In support of the above hypotheses are the morphology of the surface {{and the nature of the}} wear debris produced. (C) 2002 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E
40|$|Due to the {{outstanding}} properties of cubic boron nitride (c-BN) -DDS c-BN {{is the second}} hardest of all known materials, has a high wear resistance and a high thermal stability -DDS this material is very promising for {{a broad range of}} applications, especially for cutting tools, both as bulk and as a coating material. The state-of-the-art is the use of sintered cutting inserts with c-BN grains. Such c-BN grains are synthesized in an expensive high-pressure-high-temperature process. The requirements for cutting tools continuously increase in production engineering and this leads to a strong demand for new super <b>hard</b> <b>tool</b> coatings. Cubic boron nitride coatings could be an attractive solution. Unfortunately, the preparation of thick c-BN coatings, on the µm scale, is difficult, due to some serious drawbacks and has been successful only in the last years for a few research groups worldwide. PVD processes allow the preparation of c-BN films thicker than 2 µm on silicon and 1 µm c-BN top layers on pre-coated cemented carbide cutting inserts. Measurements of mechanical properties like hardness and Young's modulus reveal that the properties of the c-BN coatings, with hardness of about 60 GPa, are nearly identical to those of c-BN bulk material. Results of systematic turning and milling tests of different coatings in combination with a c-BN top-layer on cemented carbide cutting inserts will be presented in detail.
