5|$|It was {{reported}} in 2006 that suicide {{was one of the}} top causes of death of Singapore youths. In 2001, five children younger than 15 years took their lives, and 37 people between the ages of 15 and 25 did so. The coroner's report of a junior college student who killed <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> he believed his penis was too small {{was reported}} in the international media. The pressure exerted by parents on their children to produce good academic results has also been a contributing factor in some suicides.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the idea}} of {{becoming}} a marine zoologist interested him, Franco had always secretly wanted to become an actor but feared being rejected. He enrolled at the University of California, Los Angeles (UCLA) as an English major, but dropped out after his first year against his parents' wishes {{to pursue a career}} as an actor, since {{he would have had to}} wait two years to audition for their acting program. Franco instead chose to take acting lessons with Robert Carnegie at the Playhouse West. Around this time, Franco took up a late-night job at McDonald's to support <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> his parents refused to do so. He was a vegetarian until working there. While working at the establishment, he would practice accents on customers, an experience he remembered nostalgically in a 2015 Washington Post editorial ("McDonald’s was there for me when no one else was").|$|E
5|$|As {{they leave}} Vagra II, the crew holds a {{memorial}} service for Lt. Yar, with a pre-recorded simulation of Yar addressing each of the senior crew members telling them what they meant to her and what she learned from each of them. After the service, Data (Brent Spiner), who had previously become close to Yar, tells Picard that he is confused as to the purpose of the service. He says that his thoughts are for <b>himself,</b> <b>because</b> he can only think of how empty his life will be without Tasha. He asks if he has missed the point, but Picard assures him he got it.|$|E

5|$|Donald Petrie was {{originally}} signed {{to direct the}} episode, but dropped out to direct the film Mystic Pizza. Executive producer Robert Justman brought in Rob Bowman to direct his first Star Trek episode. Justman later {{said that this was}} one of his most-significant achievements on The Next Generation. Bowman worked on storyboards and set blocking for twenty days before shooting the episode. He was initially nervous about working on the show, and felt he had to prove <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> of his relative inexperience as a director. Bowman said that after the second day of filming it became easier, and credited the crew with making him feel welcome. He went on to direct twelve more episodes of The Next Generation.|$|E
5|$|Fairley {{travelled}} to New Guinea {{at the end}} of June 1943 {{and arranged}} for Plasmodium falciparum cases to be evacuated to Cairns for treatment. As the flight time from Port Moresby to Cairns was only a few hours, this was considered safe, but since the disease can be fatal if not treated promptly, Fairley was concerned lest the cases be delayed for some reason. Movement Control suggested that a special priority be allocated to such cases, and Major General Frank Berryman suggested calling it priority Neil after Fairley <b>himself.</b> <b>Because</b> movement priorities had to have five letters, an extra L was added on the end. Priority Neill soon came to be applied to the entire Cairns project.|$|E
5|$|Hugh of Avalon died on 16 November 1200, but no new bishop {{was elected}} {{for over two}} years. King John first tried to impose his own appointee, {{but was unable to}} force his choice on the cathedral chapter, who were {{responsible}} for electing a new bishop. John then left the see vacant, and some contemporaries accused the king of doing so to secure the revenues of the see for <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> of the regalian right English kings had to receive all the income from a vacant bishopric. Eventually the cathedral chapter was allowed to perform an election, and Blois was elected about 6 July 1203 and consecrated on 24 August 1203 at Canterbury. The consecration was performed by William of Sainte-Mère-Eglise, the Bishop of London, because Hubert Walter, the Archbishop of Canterbury was ill and unable to perform the service which would normally have been his right.|$|E

5|$|In America, {{he again}} tried {{his hand at}} journalism, but a brief stint {{as editor of the}} New Yorker Yiddishe Ilustrirte Zaitung {{resulted}} only in getting the paper suspended and landing himself a rather large fine. On March 31, 1905, he recited poetry at a benefit performance at Cooper Union to raise a pension for Yiddish poet Eliakum Zunser, even worse off than <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> he had found himself unable to write since coming to America in 1889. Shortly afterwards, he met a group of young people who had a Hebrew language association at the Dr. Herzl Zion Club, and wrote a Hebrew-language play David ba-Milchama (David in the War), which they performed in March 1906, the first Hebrew-language play to be performed in America. Repeat performances in March 1907 and April 1908 drew successively larger crowds.|$|E
5|$|The {{case was}} argued {{before the court}} on March 28, 2006. Katyal argued on behalf of Hamdan, and Paul Clement, the Solicitor General of the United States, argued {{on behalf of the}} government. Chief Justice Roberts recused <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> he had {{previously}} ruled on this case as part of the three judge panel on the United States Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia Circuit. Critics called for Justice Antonin Scalia to recuse himself, since he had made allegedly improper comments about the decision of the case prior to hearing oral arguments ("I'm not about to give this man who was captured in a war a full jury trial. I mean it's crazy") but he chose not to do so.|$|E
5|$|Hinde {{attended}} {{elementary and}} middle school in Mount Carmel, Illinois, a town his father founded in 1815. The Hinde family were large landowners in Mount Carmel and Wabash County, Illinois. A portion of the family land was located on the Wabash River and included Hanging Rock and the Grand Rapids Dam. Hinde attended Indiana Asbury University (now DePauw University) in Greencastle {{for a year and a}} half before dropping out following the deaths of his father and mother. Hinde, his brother Edmund C. Hinde, and his sister Belinda Hinde were forced to live with other relatives or fend for themselves. For a short time in the 1850s, Hinde and his younger sister Belinda lived with their older sister, Martha, and her husband, Judge Charles H. Constable, in Mount Carmel and in Marshall, Illinois. As a college dropout, Hinde was initially only able to find work as a grocery clerk in Vincennes and later as a clerk in Mount Carmel. Even though these were low-paying jobs, Hinde was able to support <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> he had inherited large land holdings from his father.|$|E

5|$|In 1829, Crittenden {{was elected}} to the Kentucky House via a special election. He served as Speaker of the House for his entire term. In 1830, he was the Whig nominee to replace John Rowan in the Senate. Secretly, the party wished to {{nominate}} Henry Clay, giving him a springboard from which to launch another presidential campaign, but it was unknown whether {{he would be able to}} secure enough votes for confirmation; it was decided that Crittenden would be the nominee, and if the voting favored the Whigs by a large enough margin, Crittenden would withdraw and allow them to confirm Clay instead. The Democrats countered successively with Richard Mentor Johnson, John Rowan, Charles A. Wickliffe, and John Breathitt. None of them polled more than sixty-four of the sixty-nine votes needed for confirmation. Crittenden garnered sixty-eight votes on fourteen different ballots, but he refused to vote for <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> he wanted Clay to be the nominee. Some of Crittenden's supporters, however, refused to vote for Clay, and the seat was left vacant.|$|E
5|$|In mid-2005 Barrales {{began looking}} for musicians for the band, asking friends of his {{to see if they}} could {{recommend}} anyone, which is how he heard of guitarist Alex Lee. When Barrales saw Lee play, he dropped the thought of trying to play rhythm guitar <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> he had a fear of not being able to keep up. There were a few years that Lee was playing guitar, but he was already playing along to music by Steve Vai, John Petrucci, Rusty Cooley, Paul Gilbert and Michael Angelo Batio. Lee decided to join Barrales, and together, they went on searching until they found themselves the drummer Carlos Regalado, who was known locally by playing covers of Megadeth and Metallica. With Regalado in the band, he helped to find bassist Ruben Dominguez. The band was impressed with the skills of Dominguez, who soon joined the band completing its line-up. The band then decided to name themselves after Exodus' Bonded by Blood, an album they had in common in their collection, even though their music tastes differed.|$|E
25|$|Like much of Metzinger's work, Le goûter was {{discussed}} {{in books and}} journals of the time—including one called Cubism co-authored by Metzinger <b>himself.</b> <b>Because</b> the group with which Weinrich associated read about and discussed avant-garde art in general and Cubism in particular, it is reasonably likely that Weinrich was familiar with Metzinger's work before she began her own.|$|E

25|$|When {{he was a}} {{midshipman}} he {{must have}} given a good account of <b>himself</b> <b>because,</b> when in 1827 Vice-Admiral Sir Henry Blackwood became Commander-in-Chief, The Nore, he appointed Currie as his Secretary. The Nore was a naval station {{at the mouth of}} the River Thames and for several hundred years one of the most important commands for the defence of the United Kingdom.|$|E
25|$|The first judge {{assigned}} to the case recused <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> {{he said he had}} a negative opinion of Miller dating to 2004 when he was Miller's judicial supervisor. Miller filed a preliminary injunction as part of the suit, asking that the federal judge immediately order the State to stop counting the ballots, due to irreparable harm that would happen if the counting continued, but the request was denied.|$|E

A second edition {{was released}} later.|$|E
25|$|The next {{release date}} for the album was listed as July 6, 2010, but at this time Game delayed the release date <b>himself,</b> <b>because</b> he wanted to release the album on August 24, 2010, in order to {{dedicated}} to a Los Angeles Lakers player Kobe Bryant. He stated he chose the date to be release on August 24, which causes him {{to get caught up}} during the 2010 NBA Finals frenzy and was inspired by his home team hero Kobe Bryant, but later the date would be pushed back as well.|$|E
25|$|Euronymous used Dead's suicide {{to foster}} Mayhem's 'evil' image and claimed Dead had killed <b>himself</b> <b>because</b> death metal had become 'trendy' and commercialized.

The band later denied the former rumor, but confirmed that the latter was true.
