40|$|Some {{scholars}} {{view the}} internet as a place of democracy, where free speech leads to sincere dialogue. Others see it as a place which, instead of endorsing dialogue, actually promotes the offline social order and creates even more animosity between different groups. This paper explores the option of online dialogue in the media of YouTube. It is done so by addressing the rather heated issue of Islamophobia, through the case study of a YouTube video titled Three Things About Islam. The ideology behind the video seems to support the notion <b>of</b> <b>Islam</b> as a threat and its presentation <b>of</b> <b>Islam</b> is closed-minded and tends to generalize. In this case the participatory culture of the media in which the video was presented, YouTube, created a dialogue between anti-Islamists and <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> <b>Islam.</b> This dialogue, like many dialogues, might not change the opinions of either side, but the mere fact that the online sphere embraces and promotes religious dialogue is an important phenomenon...|$|R

The German Salafist movement is a radical branch <b>of</b> <b>Islam,</b> which {{is characterized by a}} fundamentalist way of life according to a literal interpretation of the Koran. To the German public, this movement is known mainly for its major propaganda activities. In Germany this movement has grown in popularity within a short time and now holds a special position. Salafists have earned acclaim for their numerous activities, such as "Islamic seminaries" or their significant Internet propaganda. The activities of the movement are viewed with concern not only by the media, the political scene and the German public, but also by the German secret service. In particular the German intelligence service is currently struggling with the problem of the growing number <b>of</b> <b>supporters</b> <b>of</b> an Islamic state and their departure to Syria and Iraq. The question of preventing this radicalization, especially of young German Muslims, remains in many respects still unanswered.
