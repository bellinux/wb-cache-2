5|$|Tellurium {{does not}} readily form analogues of {{alcohols}} and thiols, with the <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> –TeH, that are called tellurols. The –TeH <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> is also attributed using the prefix tellanyl-. Like H2Te, these species are unstable {{with respect to}} loss of hydrogen. Telluraethers (R–Te–R) are more stable, as are telluroxides.|$|E
5|$|Like {{the other}} carbon–halogen bonds, the C–Cl bond {{is a common}} <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> that forms part of core organic chemistry. Formally, {{compounds}} with this <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> may be considered organic derivatives of the chloride anion. Due to the difference of electronegativity between chlorine (3.16) and carbon (2.55), the carbon in a C–Cl bond is electron-deficient and thus electrophilic. Chlorination modifies the physical properties of hydrocarbons in several ways: chlorocarbons are typically denser than water due to the higher atomic weight of chlorine versus hydrogen, and aliphatic organochlorides are alkylating agents because chloride is a leaving group.|$|E
5|$|An old {{qualitative}} {{test for}} the presence of the alkene <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> is that alkenes turn brown aqueous bromine solutions colourless, forming a bromohydrin with some of the dibromoalkane also produced. The reaction passes through a short-lived strongly electrophilic bromonium intermediate. This {{is an example of a}} halogen addition reaction.|$|E
50|$|Scavenger resins are {{polymers}} (resins) with bound <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> that {{react with}} specific by-products, impurities, or excess reagents produced in a reaction. Polymer-bound <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> permit {{the use of}} many different scavengers, as the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> are confined within a resin or are simply bound to the solid support of a bead. Simply, the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> of one scavenger will react minimally with the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> of another.|$|R

Cylindrocyclophanes A4 - A1, C4 - C1, F4, and AB4 also have <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> on C-29 (R4) and C-33 (R2) and differ from cylindrocyclophanes A-F mainly in their halogenated <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> See the following table for {{a complete list of}} <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> for the known cylindrocyclophanes: ...|$|R

5|$|Polyols, {{compounds}} containing {{more than}} one alcohol <b>functional</b> <b>group,</b> generally interact with cupric salts. For example, copper salts are used to test for reducing sugars. Specifically, using Benedict's reagent and Fehling's solution {{the presence of the}} sugar is signaled by a color change from blue Cu(II) to reddish copper(I) oxide. Schweizer's reagent and related complexes with ethylenediamine and other amines dissolve cellulose. Amino acids form very stable chelate complexes with copper(II). Many wet-chemical tests for copper ions exist, one involving potassium ferrocyanide, which gives a brown precipitate with copper(II) salts.|$|E
5|$|The {{shortcomings}} {{noted above}} limit {{the usefulness of}} the Nazarov cyclization reaction in its canonical form. However, modifications to the reaction focused on remedying its issues continue to be an active area of academic research. In particular, the research has focused on a few key areas: rendering the reaction catalytic in the promoter, effecting the reaction with more mild promoters to improve <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> tolerance, directing the regioselectivity of the elimination step, and improving the overall stereoselectivity. These have been successful to varying degrees.|$|E
5|$|The {{synthesis}} of aziridines from imines {{is another important}} application of the Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky reaction and provides an alternative to amine transfer from oxaziridines. Though less widely applied, the reaction has a similar substrate scope and <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> tolerance to the carbonyl equivalent. The examples shown below are representative; in the latter, an aziridine forms in situ and is opened via nucleophilic attack to form the corresponding amine.|$|E

There are two ways used for testing the sulphur-containing <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in coal, i.e. destructive testing and non-destructive testing. Hence, the sulphur-containing <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> shall be studied by a multi-scaled and high-level means. Meanwhile, other new testing methods shall also be explored to improve and supplement the studies on the sulphur-containing <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in coal.|$|R
30|$|These <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> were {{involved}} in the chemisorption process. The bands present below 800  cm− 1 were finger print zone of phosphate and sulfur <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> and N-containing bioligands. The appearance of new peaks at 1431.37, 1736.09 and 2850.35 Cm− 1 was probably due to the modification of the surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> by the interaction of Cd+ 2 ions. These band positions revealed the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> C=O carboxylic acid of amide, C=O carboxylic acid of alcohol and CH 2 stretching, respectively. The analysis of the FTIR spectra showed the presence of ionizable <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> (i.e., carboxyl, hydroxyl and amino) that are able to interact with metal ions Cd+ 2.|$|R
40|$|Activated carbons were {{produced}} in the laboratory from wood using a 20 -run PlackettBurman experimental design for 19 factors. The obtained batches of activated carbon were analysed by potentiometric titration and FTIR spectroscopy to determine the surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> The results obtained by potentiometric titration displayed the distribution of individual acidity constants of those groups in the pK range. Considering this parameter, the surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> were divided into carboxyl, lactone and phenol. The linear regression equations reflecting the influence of each operation used for the synthesis {{on the amount of}} these <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in the obtained activated carbons were generated. The FTIR spectra were used in parallel for the evaluation of the amount and the type of the surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> Relationships between the two data sets obtained by potentiometric titration and FTIR spectroscopy were evaluated by correlation analysis. It was established that the amount of surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> determined by potentiometric titration positively correlates with the intensity of the peaks of hydrophilic <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in the FTIR spectra. At the same time, the negative correlation between potentiometrically determined amount of surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> and the intensity of peaks of hydrophobic <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> was observed. Most probably, these non-polar formations can take part in the interaction of carbon surface with H+/OH- ions and diminish the strength of existent <b>functional</b> <b>groups...</b>|$|R
5|$|Electronegativity is a {{chemical}} property {{that describes the}} tendency of an atom or a <b>functional</b> <b>group</b> to attract electrons (or electron density) towards itself. If the bond between sodium and chlorine in sodium chloride were covalent, the pair of shared electrons would be attracted to the chlorine because the effective nuclear charge on the outer electrons is +7 in chlorine but is only +1 in sodium. The electron pair is attracted {{so close to the}} chlorine atom that they are practically transferred to the chlorine atom (an ionic bond). However, if the sodium atom was replaced by a lithium atom, the electrons will not be attracted as close to the chlorine atom as before because the lithium atom is smaller, making the electron pair more strongly attracted to the closer effective nuclear charge from lithium. Hence, the larger alkali metal atoms (further down the group) will be less electronegative as the bonding pair is less strongly attracted towards them. As mentioned previously, francium is expected to be an exception.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Fourier {{transform}} infrared spectrometry (FTIR) {{was used}} to evaluate the possible <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> present in biodiesel. It is an easy way to identify the presence of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in the sample and its structure based on the energies associated with the molecular vibration when irradiated. In these work three samples; ricinus communis, Hevea brasiliensis and Jatropha curcas oils were run through FTIR, the bonds as well as <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> present are found to respond differently to the incoming radiation, due to variation in their molecular vibration of stretching and bending. The response of the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> are characterized by observing the transmission of infrared radiations and comparing it with known standards in order to identify the type and the nature of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> present in the samples. The presence and the nature of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> among other factors provide information on the stability of the biodiesel fuel. This paper is thus designed to evaluate the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> and structure in order to establish the reactivity of these fuels as a function of possible degradation...|$|R

In this paper, we not only analyzed the reasons for the increase of the capacity that promoted by oxygen <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in the charge-discharge cycling tests, but also analyzed the mechanism how the pseudocapacitance was provided by the oxygen <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in the acid/alkaline aqueous electrolyte.

30|$|Thus, {{as follows}} from the IR spectra, UV/O 3 {{functionalized}} GNPs do not lead to the appearance of additional <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> {{on the surface of}} the GNPs. The number of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> that arise on the surface of carbon due to UV/ozone treatment and functionalization ozone significantly is less as compared with the number of <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> joining the carbon at the surface after chemical functionalization (acetone treatment). UV/ozone functionalization of carbon apparently causes partial destruction of some <b>functional</b> <b>groups,</b> such as, for example, carboxyl group, and also reduces the deformation vibrations (δOH) and vibrations of C–O group.|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{reactions}} of surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> {{have an important}} role in controlling conversion of char nitrogen to NOx during coal combustion. This study involved an investigation of the thermal stability and {{reactions of}} nitrogen surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> in nanoporous carbons. Four suites of carbons, which were used as models for coal chars, were prepared {{with a wide range of}} nitrogen and oxygen contents and types of <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> The porous structures of the carbons were characterized by gas adsorption methods while chemical analysis, X-ray photoelectron spectroscopy, and X-ray near edge structure spectroscopy were used to characterize the surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups.</b> Temperature programmed desorption and temperature programmed reduction methods were used to study the reactivity of the surface <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> during heat treatment under inert and reducing conditions. Heat treatment studies show that the order of stability of the <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> is quaternary nitrogen>pyridinic>pyrrolic>pyridineN-oxide. PyridineN-oxide surface groups desorb NO and formN 2 via surface reactions at low temperature. Pyrrolic and pyridinic <b>functional</b> <b>groups</b> decompose and react with surface species to give NH 3, HCN, and N 2 as desorption products, but most pyrrolic groups are preferentially converted to pyridinic and quaternary nitrogen.
