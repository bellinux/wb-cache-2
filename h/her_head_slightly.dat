60|$|Susan tossed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly,</b> but {{admitted}} that the morning was good.|$|E
60|$|She moved <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> in {{a manner}} that was neither affirmative nor negative.|$|E
60|$|Elizabeth turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> {{and looked}} at him; he backed precipitately toward the door.|$|E
60|$|Miss De Stancy shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> too <b>slightly</b> {{to express}} {{absolute}} negation.|$|R
60|$|Suddenly {{she paused}} in <b>her</b> work, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> turned <b>slightly</b> {{to one side}} to listen.|$|R
60|$|She made no answer. She moved <b>her</b> <b>head</b> very <b>slightly</b> so that {{he could}} not see her face, and {{remained}} sitting rather stiffly and awkwardly with her eyes upon the fire.|$|R
60|$|Wilhelmina turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly,</b> so {{that she}} was now {{directly}} facing him. She looked him steadily in the eyes.|$|E
60|$|The butler {{was holding}} open the door. Two {{of the girls}} had {{suddenly}} taken possession of Jane. She shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b>|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, yes," [...] {{she said}} quickly, still {{grasping}} both his hands, but with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> {{turned in the}} direction of the mill.|$|E
60|$|She {{inclined}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> ever so <b>slightly</b> {{to where}} his late companions were seated.|$|R
25|$|The womanâ€™s head {{is large}} in scale, {{with a broad}} face and wide cheeks. She has a long {{straight}} neck, and <b>her</b> <b>head</b> is <b>slightly</b> turned to the left side, creating a three-quarters portrait.|$|R
50|$|The {{sculpture}} was modelled between 1867 and 1872 from {{marble and}} depicts a partially nude, young Native American girl walking with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> turned <b>slightly</b> to one side. It was Hiram Powers' last full-length sculpture.|$|R
6000|$|Nasha {{smiled a}} little. [...] "I feel nothing, but perhaps I'm more {{used to being}} stared at." [...] She turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b> [...] "Oh!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He startled me," [...] {{repeated}} Heyst. She {{noted the}} anxiety in his tone, and turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> {{to look at}} him across the table.|$|E
60|$|Madame de Melbain raised <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b> Her brows were {{a little}} contracted. From her eyes there flashed the silent fire of a queen's disdain.|$|E
60|$|<b>Her</b> <b>head</b> was <b>slightly</b> turned away. He had {{to content}} himself with looking {{down upon the}} strong feet in their {{serviceable}} but smartly buckled shoes that uplifted her upright figure as she moved beside him.|$|R
6000|$|... "But why," [...] {{she said}} with <b>her</b> <b>head</b> still <b>slightly</b> turned away toward a figure--a sturdy-looking woman, which, for the first time, Hoffman {{perceived}} was walking in a line with them as the chasseur had done--"why {{did you come here}} at all?" ...|$|R
60|$|Jim studied her. Her pose was unconsciously graceful; her tall {{figure and}} plain gray dress {{harmonized}} with {{the background of}} straight trunks and rocks. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> was <b>slightly</b> tilted back as she breathed the resin-scented air. Jim thought she looked strangely virile and alert.|$|R
6000|$|... "Oh yes!" [...] These two monosyllables were uttered in a sadder tone than ever; and as {{she said}} them she shook <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> and sighed. [...] "Will you prosecute him?" ...|$|E
6000|$|MR. WILLINGS. 'Your son, Mrs. Dowey--he has {{got five}} days' leave.' She shakes <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly,</b> {{or perhaps it}} only trembles a little on its stem. 'Now, now, good news doesn't kill.' ...|$|E
60|$|She made a queer movement, lifting <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> in a sipping, half-inviting, half-commanding gesture. And Joe was {{crouching}} {{already to}} jump off the truck to obey her, when Albert {{put his hand on}} his shoulder.|$|E
60|$|She {{was half}} {{curled up in}} a corner of the settee, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> resting <b>slightly</b> upon <b>her</b> long fingers, her brown eyes {{steadily}} fixed upon her companion. There was an atmosphere about her of serious yet of tender things. Dominey's face seemed to fall into more rigid lines as he realised the appeal of her eyes.|$|R
60|$|He {{struck a}} note, and Anna responded. Playing {{with one hand}} he turned on his stool to glance at her. Instinctively she {{had fallen into the}} posture of the poster, her hands behind <b>her,</b> <b>her</b> <b>head</b> bent <b>slightly</b> forward, <b>her</b> chin uplifted, her eyes bright with the drollery of the song. Mr. Earles closed the piano with a little bang.|$|R
50|$|A three-quarter length {{depiction}} of Agnes of Rome shows the saint in direct communication with God. <b>Her</b> <b>head</b> is <b>slightly</b> raised, <b>her</b> mouth half open, and {{the fingers of}} her hand are spread open over her heart while with her other hand she caresses the Mystic Lamb. Her neckline shifts sideways to reveal part of her shoulder, the highest degree of eroticism {{in the work of}} Stanzione.|$|R
6000|$|Meta sighed, {{and shook}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly,</b> as she said, [...] "She is so gentle and considerate. I {{think this has}} been no fresh pain to her to-day, but I cannot tell. The whole day has been a strange intermixture." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{took her}} {{cigarette}} {{from her lips}} and turned <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b> Peter's expression was one of amiable reminiscence. His cheeks were a trifle flushed, his appearance was entirely reassuring. She laughed at her brother's caution. She found her companion delightful.|$|E
6000|$|Miss Elsie tossed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly.</b> Nevertheless, {{before they}} left the station, she {{informed}} him {{that she had been}} told that the station-master had addressed the stranger as [...] "my lord," [...] and that another passenger had said he was [...] "Lord Duncaster." ...|$|E
50|$|Highlander: The Search For Vengeance {{contains}} two Quickenings {{that occur in}} the same manner as those in the first original Highlander movie. A Japanese woman in the fields undergoes vibrations in <b>her</b> <b>head</b> and <b>slightly</b> rolls <b>her</b> eyes as she becomes immortal. Colin MacLeod's Quickening by lightning takes place inside an old Stonehenge-like structure and is very similar to Connor MacLeod's Quickening in the Highlands of Scotland.|$|R
60|$|For {{several minutes}} Lady Ruth said nothing. She was {{leaning back in}} the {{farthest}} corner of <b>her</b> chair, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> resting <b>slightly</b> upon <b>her</b> fingers, her eyes studying with a curious intentness the outline of Wingrave's pale, hard face. He himself, either unconscious of, or indifferent to her close scrutiny, had simply {{the air of a}} man possessed of an inexhaustible fund of patience.|$|R
6000|$|Wilhelmina sat quite still. <b>Her</b> <b>head,</b> resting <b>slightly</b> {{upon the}} long {{delicate}} fingers {{of her right}} hand, was {{turned away from the}} young man who was daring to watch her. She was apparently gazing across the park, down the magnificent avenue of elms which led to the village. So he was gone--without a word! How else? On the whole she could not but approve! And yet!--and yet! ...|$|R
6000|$|Reassured {{by those}} {{words and the}} {{knowledge}} that Mr. Lavender's plans seldom remained the same {{for more than two}} days, Mrs. Petty tossed <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> and went to the door. [...] "Well, it is a mystery, I'm sure," [...] she said.|$|E
6000|$|... "Did I, too, look sinister?" [...] said Mrs. Travers, turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> {{toward her}} husband. [...] "And yet I {{assure you that}} I was glad, profoundly glad, to see you safe from danger for a time at least. To gain time is everything. [...] ." ...|$|E
60|$|She {{inclined}} <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>slightly</b> in {{acknowledgment of}} his bow, and he whirled {{out of the}} room and down the dim narrow passageway into the arms of Mrs. Pasmer, who had resisted as long as she could her curiosity to know what the angry voices of himself and Alice meant.|$|E
25|$|This statue is {{the least}} well-preserved of the statues found in the Piraeus cache; the bronze has crumbled slightly, and other {{sections}} have separated completely. The right side of <b>her</b> <b>head</b> is also <b>slightly</b> disfigured due to swelling.|$|R
40|$|Photographic {{portrait}} of Mrs. Benjamin Goldman (Goldmin?), [s. d. ]. Mrs. Goldman {{can be seen}} from her upper torso to <b>her</b> <b>head</b> looking <b>slightly</b> to the right with her shoulders turned slightly to the left. She is visible wearing a black jacket with a printed shirt and a black pearl necklace. Her long dark hair can be seen tied up in a bun on top of <b>her</b> <b>head,</b> partially exposing <b>her</b> ear at left. She has a wide mouth and thick eyebrows...|$|R
6000|$|... "You've {{no need to}} do that," [...] {{retorted}} her father. She took no notice. The {{youth was}} between the two wills. The colour mounted into the father's face, his blue eyes stared. The girl stood near the door, <b>her</b> <b>head</b> held <b>slightly</b> back, like {{an indication that the}} youth must come. He rose, in his silent, intent way, and was gone with her. The blood swelled in Brangwen's forehead veins.|$|R
