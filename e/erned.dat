40|$|A {{new model}} that {{addresses}} the shortcomings of Sievert 's law for predicting hydrogen absorption is proposed ABSTRACT. A systematic review of previ· ous {{research has shown that}} the use of Sievert's law {based on equilibrium ab· sorption of diatomic hydrogen) to calcu· late the hydrogen absorption reaction temperature in the weld pool is invalid. A new model of hydrogen absorption is proposed which can explain both previ-ously measured data and the data ob· tained in this study. This two-step model proposes that the hydrogen dissociation reaction is gov· <b>erned</b> by the temperature of the cathode boundary layer, and that the hydrogen absorption reaction (of both monatomic and diatomic hydrogen) is governed by the surface temperature of the weld pool. Following this hypothesis further, the rna· jority of the hydrogen will absorb into the outer portion of the weld pool rather than the central region as has been proposed by others. This new model can be used to predict phenomena that the previous theory was unable to address. In addition, a theoret-ical foundation is formulated {{in order to understand the}} effect of the arc plasma on other gas-metal reactions that occur dur-ing welding...|$|E

This memo estimates the required olle ting area of FASR below 300 MHz for a prototypi al CME based on observations by Bastian et al (2001) between 164 and 432 MHz with the radioheliograph at Nan ay, Fran e. Out to a distan e of about one solar radius from the photosphere the CME spe trum drops sharply below 150 MHz, presumably due to Razin-Tsytovi h suppression, but at greater distan es from the sun the CME loop should be dete table as low as 50 MHz at brightness temperatures greater than 10, 000 K or so. The Nan ay data show that the spe tral index of the CME loop de reases very rapidly with in reasing solar radius and the radiation model proposed infers that measurements below 150 MHz will yield onsiderable information about the CME emission me hanisms within a few solar radii. For the al ulations in this memo I will assume a 3 - surfa e brightness dete tion goal of 5000 Kelvins.

The guidelines were reviewed by two workshops held at the University of Cukurova tha t were attended by representatives of the main government agencies involvedThe evaluation of the LSIP demonstrated some of the problems brought about by more intensive use of water resources, e. g., salinity and rising levels of wa ter tables. To alleviate these problems, it was recommended that increasing attention be paid t o water management with a view to avoiding over-irrigation, improving drainage, and maki ng appropriate use of water from the irrigation and related hydraulic systemsThe findings of the evaluation indicate that there was a strong case for closer integration, as well as for more decentralization, of the government agencies co ncerned with the planning and management of large-scale irrigation projects.

40|$|The total {{concentration}} and redox state of iron were examined along a transect across the continental shelf off the Peruvian coast during. January 1984. Total and dissolved iron (0. 4 ~pm filter) were {{measured by the}} Co-APDC coprecipitation method. Fe(II) was measured by a precon- centration step with S-hydroxyquinoline bonded to silica as the stationary phase, followed by elution and the ferrozine method. Up to 40 nmol kg-l of Fe(II) was detected in the bottom water at 5 - 10 km offshore and decreased markedly upward {{in the water column}} and with distance offshore. A good correlation between the distribution of Fe(II) and nitrite in the bottom water indicated a common source from the shelf sediments. Elevated Fe(II) concentrations near the sea surface and a diel change were probably due to photochemical reactions involving iron. Total iron levels were > 300 - 500 nmol kg-' in the surface and the bottom water at 5 - 6 km offshore. About 80 - 90 % of the iron was in the particulate form, indicating a substantial input of iron from continental dust and from the sediments on the shelf. The total iron level decreased considerably within 35 km of the coastline and the iron seemed to be trapped on the shelf. Iron is found in natural waters in both Fe(II) and Fe(III) oxidation states. The dis- tribution of these two forms of iron is gov- <b>erned</b> by several factors, including redox po- tential, pH, and the presence of organic material. From thermodynamic consider- ations, the concentration of reduced forms of iron in oxic natural waters will be much lower than that of the oxidized forms of iron due to the rapid oxidation of Fe(II) by Oz. Nevertheless, {{it has been suggested that}} nonequilibrium processes may enable Fe(II) species to persist at appreciable concentra- tions in natural waters even in the presence of oxygen. McMahon (1969) suggested that annual and diurnal variations of acid-sol- uble ferrous iron in lake water were a result of photochemical reactions or of metabolic activity of microorganisms. Recently, the photochemistry of iron in natural waters has been emphasized by several studies as re- viewed by Zafiriou (1983). Miles and Bre- zonik (198 1) showed that the oxygen con- sumption in humic-colored freshwaters involved a photochemical ferrous-ferric catalytic cycle. Waite and Morel (1984...|$|E

The samples were prepared at 95 °C and changes in storage modulus (G') and loss modulus (G") during cooling to 5 °C, heating to 900 and re-cooling to 5 °C, at 1 °C/min, were measured at 1 rad s" 1 and 0. 5 % strain. In all cases, the onset temperature for gelation during cooling and the moduli recorded at 5 'C increased With increasing concentration of cosolute. However, both values were substantially lower for the liquid cosolutes than for mixtures with solid cosolutes at the same concentrations. The difference is attributed to inhibition of pectin-pectin interactions by pectin-cosolute interactions, which in turn are inhibited by cosolute-cosolute interactions. On heating there was an initial reduction in modulus, with the same temperature-course as the increase on cooling; for the solids, this was followed by an increase attributable to hydrophobic association of methyl ester substituents.

The absence of any detectable increase in modulus on heating with the liquid COSOtUteS is a trlbuted to accumulation of cosolute around tiie polymer chains promoting hydrophobic association between methyl ester groups on the same Chain; Or within Cl sters o chains, v with, therefore no contribution to network strucLarz.

The displacement of both transitions to progressively hid her temperature as the rate of heating was increased was much Greater than anticipated from a simple thermal lag, indicating that the undelying structural chancres are slow. The proposed interpretation is that fructose is capable of site-binding to pectin in both the ordered and disordered stat...|$|E
40|$|Molecular dynamic {{simulations}} {{provide valuable}} tools to study soft matter systems, since {{they can in}} principle shed light on many mechanisms happening at a size-scale hardly reachable experimentally. Unfortunately, despite the continuous development in computer technology and simulation algorithms, many phenomena characteriz- ing soft matter still happen at a size and time scale that is not easily reachable by simulation carried with atomistic resolution. Coarse graining (CG) the system by rep- resenting groups of atoms as single interaction sites (beads) enables the possibility of studying such phenomena. The quality of a coarse-grained model is related {{with the quality of}} the description of the interaction between the beads, which should prop- erly account for the chemical nature of the groups of atoms that they represent. In the recent years several methods have been developed to obtain coarse-grained in- teraction potentials. In between the available approaches to CG of particular interest is the class of methods that undergoes under the name of systematic coarse graining. Common characteristic of the methods belonging to this class is to develop models using informations obtained at a more detailed level of description of the system (e. g. atomistic level). The quality of a CG model is normally evaluated discussing its ability to predict property at the state point considered during its development (representability) and also at different state points (transferability). This thesis reviews {{the current state of the}} art of available systematic coarse grain- ing methodologies and proposes the conditional reversible work (CRW) method as a new approach to develop interaction potentials. CRW is based on the calculation of the interaction free energy between the groups of atoms that will be represented by the beads, under the condition that they are embedded in their respective molecules. Unlike many other methods CRW delivers pair interaction potentials that are free from many-body contributions and that have a clear physical meaning. In princi- ple different routes can be used to calculate the interaction free energy between the beads. In this thesis two different approaches are presented: the first one is based on a thermodynamic cycle that makes use of reversible work calculations and the second one is based on thermodynamic perturbation theory. The representability and the transferability of coarse grained models obtained employing CRW methods are discussed. In particular first a comparison is carried between the performances of two toluene CG model developed employing CRW and a well-established CG method, namely Iterative Boltzmann Inversion (IBI), showing a remarkable transferability of the CRW model. Then a model of hexane where two neighboring carbons and their belonging hydrogens are lumped together in a single interaction site is developed using CRW methods. A comparison between the property of the parent atomistic model and of the CG model proves a good representability and transferability of the model. Considering the fact that the interaction potentials are representative of the conditional free energy of the group of atoms, also the chemical transferability is in- vestigated. This expresses the possibility of employing the developed CG models for small molecules as building blocks for bigger molecules. The interaction potentials developed for the hexane molecules have been employed to simulate linear alkanes up to dodecane finding a good agreement between the properties calculated using the CG model and the parent atomistic model. Also the possibility of using CRW potentials for mixture has been tested investigating the behaviors of n-alkane mix- ture and the thermodynamic of solvating additives molecule in a polymeric matrix. Again a comparison between atomistic and CG results agree over a wide range of temperatures even for a sensitive quantities like the solvation free energy. In or- der to understand the limit of applicability of CRW pair potential approach also a study has been carried on the applicability of this method on systems that are gov- <b>erned</b> by multi body interactions. In particular a series of increasingly polar liquid has been CG as single bead. It has been found that when directional interactions are CG away the model rapidly loses the ability of describing property of the sys- tem. It is important to notice that in principle it is possible to repair at least part of this failure by employing a lower level of CG (i. e. using more bead to describe the molecules), since this allows maintaining part of the directionality of the interactions. This thesis proves the quality of CRW method to develop interaction potentials for soft matter systems. In particular it has to be remembered that the potentials devel- oped using this method are pair potentials, free of indirect contributions. Therefore this method is straightforwardly applicable to develop coarse grained models for sys- tems where pair additivity of the interaction can be considered like van der Waals dominated systems. A more careful implementation is necessary in system where multibody interactions are important. Since the CRW potentials are representative of a conditional free energy it is possible to think future application of this methods also to develop models for systems where this kind of interaction are important, like hydrophobic interaction between amino acids in water...|$|E
