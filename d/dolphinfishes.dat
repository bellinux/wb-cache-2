40|$|The <b>dolphinfish,</b> Coryphaena hippurus, is an oceanic {{epipelagic fish}} with {{economic}} importance to sport and commercial fisheries throughout its worldwide distribution in tropical and sub-tropical waters. In the eastern Caribbean, <b>dolphinfish</b> are generally piscivorous, eating {{a wide variety}} of fish species including small oceanic pelagic species (e. g. flyingfish, halfbeaks, man-o-war fish, sargassum and rough triggerfish), juveniles of large oceanic pelagic species (e. g. tunas, billfish, jacks, <b>dolphinfish),</b> and pelagic larvae of neritic, benthic species (e. g. flying gurnards, triggerfish, pufferfish, grunts). They also eat invertebrates (e. g. cephalopods, mysids, scyphozoans), suggesting that they are essentially non-selective foragers. This appears to be typical of <b>dolphinfish</b> from other locations and of tropical oceanic pelagic species in general. Post-larval flying gurnards and flyingfish rank as the most important prey species overall. However, the diet varies with season, and mysids are a very important component from October to December. Diet also varies slightly with predator size (small <b>dolphinfish</b> eat fewer flyingfish and more squid than larger sized <b>dolphinfish),</b> and with sex (males take proportionally more of the active, fast swimming species such as flyingfish, squid and <b>dolphinfish</b> than do females). From these results and {{a review of the literature}} to determine the diet of other tropical oceanic species and the predators of <b>dolphinfish,</b> it can be seen that predator-prey relationships and interspecies competition for food clearly involve other commercially important species.

50|$|Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} feeding ecology of the pelagic thresher. Its very slender tail and fine dentition suggest an exclusive diet of small, pelagic prey. Analysis of stomach contents reveal that pelagic threshers feed mainly on barracudinas, lightfishes, and escolars, all inhabitants of the mesopelagic zone. Therefore, little competition occurs between the pelagic thresher and other large oceanic piscivores such as billfishes, tunas, and <b>dolphinfishes,</b> which tend to feed near the surface. As in other threshers, pelagic threshers may swim in circles to drive schooling prey into a compact mass, before striking them sharply with the upper lobe of their tails to stun them. Because of this behavior, pelagic threshers are often hooked on longlines by their tails.|$|E

40|$|The dolphinfish, Coryphaena hippurus Linnaeus, 1758, is an {{important}} target species for Mediterranean artisanal, recreational and commercial fisheries but to date only scarce genetic data are available for its Mediterranean population(s). The genetic variation of Mediterranean <b>dolphinfishes</b> was thus investigated through the sequencing of fragments of the cytochrome c oxidase subunit 1 (COI) gene and the NADH dehydrogenase subunit 1 (ND 1) mitochondrial DNA markers with the explicit aims of (i) testing for significant genetic differentiation of the Mediterranean vs. non-Mediterranean populations of the species, and (ii) investigating the possible presence of molecular structuring within the Mediterranean basin. Performed analyses revealed significant genetic differentiation between Mediterranean and Atlantic dolphinfish population, while no significant geographically-based genetic differentiation was detected within the Mediterranean basin. The apparent lack of genetic structuring at the Mediterranean level is likely due to the highly mobile behaviour of the species, which is typical of large pelagic fishes and {{in agreement with the}} few tag data currently available.

40|$|<b>Dolphinfish,</b> Coryphaena hippurus, a {{globally}} distributed, fast growing, predatory {{species has}} extended its habitat poleward off {{the west coast}} of North America in response to atmosphere-ocean climate transients that can be measured throughout the Pacific Ocean basin. Poleward habitat extension is measured by the availability of <b>dolphinfish</b> to southern California Commercial Passenger Fishing Vessel (CPFV) anglers. Before 1972 the annual CPFV <b>dolphinfish</b> catch during the July-October fishing season seldom exceeded a few hundred fish. Thereafter, more than 103 <b>dolphinfish</b> were taken in 23 of the next 25 seasons. The next shift was in 1990 when catch exceeded 3. 0 x 104 fish.

The apparent habitat extension coincides with increased ocean temperatures, forced by increases in North Pacific cyclogenesis and increases in downwelling coastal-trapped long wave transmission from the equatorial ocean. Interannual analysis shows that habitat expansion is associated with a decrease in upwelling off northern Mexico, which may be locally or remotely forced. <b>Dolphinfish</b> habitat shifts poleward in response to Pacific climate transients, reflecting global environmental trends.

40|$|Various {{factors may}} impact the {{processes}} of diversification of a clade. In the marine realm, {{it has been shown}} that coral reef environments have promoted diversification in various fish groups. With the exception of requiem sharks, all the groups showing a higher level of diversity in reefs than in non-reef habitats have diets based predominantly on plankton, algae or benthic invert- ebrates. Here we explore the pattern of diversification of carangoid fishes, a clade that includes numerous piscivorous species (e. g. trevallies, jacks and <b>dolphinfishes),</b> using time-calibrated phylogenies as well as ecological and morphological data from both extant and fossil species. The study of caran- goid morphospace suggests that reef environments played a role in their early radiation during the Eocene. However, contrary to the hypothesis of a reef-association-promoting effect, we show that habitat shifts to non-reef environments have increased the rates of morphological diversification (i. e. size and body shape) in extant carangoids. Piscivory did not have a major impact on the tempo of diversification of this group. Through the ecological radiation of carangoid fishes, we demonstrate that non-reef environments may sustain and promote processes of diversification of different marine fish groups, at least those including a large proportion of piscivorous species.

Average levels of bycatch were 0. 518 metric tons (t) per set, and 27. 1 t per 1000 t of target species. The total annual purse-seine catch of yellowfin and skipjack tunas by principal fishing nations in the WIO during 1985 – 94 was 118, 000 – 277, 000 t. Nonrecorded annual bycatch for this period was estimated at 944 – 2270 t of pelagic oceanic sharks, 720 – 1877 t of rainbow runners, 705 – 1836 t of <b>dolphinfishes,</b> 507 – 1322 t of triggerfishes, 113 – 294 t of wahoo, 104 – 251 t of billfishes, 53 – 112 t of mobulas and mantas, 35 – 89 t of mackerel scad, 9 – 24 t of barracudas, and 67 – 174 t of other fishes.

This paper contributes to a comprehensive assessment of life history traits and fishery attributes of target and bycatch species caught by the tuna longline fishery in the South Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Data was compiled on seven life history traits and three fishery attributes for 33 and 27 teleost stocks caught by longliners in South Atlantic and Indian Oceans, respectively. In addition, each species was assigned into four categories describing {{the fate of the}} catch: target species for commercial use, bycatch species kept for consumption, bycatch species kept for commercial use and discarded bycatch. Life history traits and fishery attributes did not differ between oceans. However, non-target but commercialized species were smaller in the Atlantic Ocean.

40|$|We assayed genetic {{variations}} at five microsatellite loci of <b>dolphinfish</b> captured at five {{sites in}} 2005 and eight sites in 2006 to detect genetic population structure of <b>dolphinfish</b> Coryphaena hippurus in theGulf of California and surrounding waters. Results show high genetic variation, {{similar to other}} pelagicfishes with large populations. Pairwise FST values and hierarchical AMOVA detected subtle but significantspatial and temporal heterogeneity, mainly in samples of 2005 and some of 2006. However, Bayesianassignment analysis failed to detect genetic differentiation, which was also supported by the Mantel testand gene flow estimates among the sampled sites. This suggests that, despite the slight heterogeneitydetected in this region, the <b>dolphinfish</b> forms a single panmictic population with high genetic variationand gene flow...|$|R
