2500|$|In the 1990s, Russia's {{prison system}} was widely {{reported}} by media {{and human rights}} groups as troubled. There were large case backlogs and trial delays, resulting in lengthy pre-trial detention. Prison conditions were viewed as well below international standards. Tuberculosis was a serious, pervasive problem. [...] Human rights groups estimated that about 11,000 inmates and prison detainees die annually, most because of overcrowding, disease, and lack of medical care. A media report dated 2006 points to a campaign of prison reform {{that has resulted in}} apparent improvements in conditions. The Swiss Agency for <b>Development</b> <b>and</b> <b>Cooperation</b> has been working to reform Russia's prisons since 1997, in concert with reform efforts by the national government.|$|E

40|$|The {{aim of this}} {{dissertation}} is {{to examine}} and compare William Easterly’s and PGU’s (Shared Responsibility: Sweden's Policy for Global Development) different views on <b>development</b> <b>and</b> international <b>development</b> <b>cooperation.</b> The methodological approach chosen {{in this study is}} an analysis of ideas based on the following questions: 1. Which principles should be applied to <b>development</b> <b>and</b> international <b>development</b> <b>cooperation?</b> 2. Which are the central actors in <b>development</b> <b>and</b> international <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> <b>and</b> what should their roles be in the development process? 3. Between which levels in society should the international development cooperation take place? The result shows that Easterly and PGU agree that the receiving society should be responsible for the <b>development</b> process <b>and</b> that the poor are important actors in this process. In spite of their common view on the importance of national ownership their strategies <b>and</b> views on <b>development</b> <b>and</b> international <b>development</b> <b>cooperation</b> differ from one another. The main differences are based on their different views on how social changes should be done. Easterly suggests a piecemeal social engineering in contrast to PGU who suggests a holistic social engineering...|$|R
