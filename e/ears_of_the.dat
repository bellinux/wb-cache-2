Sergeants Stephanie Crawford and Tim Jenkins credit the marked improvement {{to not only}} the outstanding work of the LPD, {{but also to the}} involvement of Lawton’s citizens. One of the key contributing factors is local Neighborhood Watch groups, which act as the eyes and <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> police department in the areas they represent. They also share tips on how to protect themselves with their neighbors at regular neighborhood meetings.|$|E

5|$|Lions are muscular, deep-chested felids with short, rounded heads, reduced {{necks and}} round <b>ears.</b> <b>Of</b> <b>the</b> living, non-hybrid felids, the lion {{is second only}} to the tiger in length and weight. Its skull is very {{similar to that of the}} tiger, {{although}} the frontal region is usually more depressed and flattened, with a slightly shorter postorbital region and broader nasal openings than that of a tiger. However, due to the amount of skull variation in the two species, usually only the structure of the lower jaw can be used as a reliable indicator of species. Lion colouration varies from light buff to silverly gray, to yellowish red and dark brown. The underparts are generally lighter and cubs are born with dark spots on their body. The spots fade as lions reach adulthood, although faint spots often may still be seen on the legs and underparts.|$|E
5|$|The SASR {{played a}} key role in the Australian-led {{international}} peacekeeping force (INTERFET) in East Timor between September 1999 and February 2000. In the days prior to the commencement of INTERFET, the SASR was involved in the RAAF evacuation of United Nations Mission in East Timor (UNAMET) staff, Australians and refugees from East Timor following increasing violence by Indonesian military-backed militia after the East Timorese voted for independence from Indonesia. The SASR subsequently provided the initial INTERFET forces to secure the point of entry at the airport and seaport in Dili. 3 Squadron, along with Allied Special Forces elements from the NZ SAS and British SBS, formed INTERFET's special forces element, known as Response Force (RESPFOR). The SASR spearheaded most operations conducted by the international force during the early days of the intervention in East Timor and, as in Vietnam, served as the eyes and <b>ears</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> force, patrolling extensively through militia-controlled areas in vehicles and on foot as INTERFET expanded to take control of the rest of East Timor. It was involved in a number of significant contacts with pro-Indonesian militia, including at Suai on 6 October 1999 during which two SASR soldiers were wounded, and later at Aidabasalala on 16 October 1999. On 22 October 1999, the SASR conducted a combined air insertion in Black Hawk helicopters and an amphibious landing from HMAS Brunei into the Oecusse Enclave to secure the beachhead ahead of an amphibious assault by the main force, after the insertion of Navy Clearance Divers by submarine the previous night to conduct a reconnaissance and survey of the amphibious landing site. It was reported that the SASR also conducted covert patrols in the Enclave before the landings. Other tasks included VIP protection and other special forces tasks as required by the task force commander. 3 Squadron was later awarded a Meritorious Unit Citation on 25 March 2000. 1 Squadron replaced 3 Squadron in December 1999, and completed its tour in February 2000.|$|E

500|$|Migration Period (5th and 6th centuries CE) gold bracteates (types A, B, and C) {{feature a}} {{depiction}} of a human figure above a horse, holding a spear and flanked {{by one or more}} often two birds. <b>The</b> presence <b>of</b> <b>the</b> birds has led to <b>the</b> iconographic identification <b>of</b> <b>the</b> human figure as the god Odin, flanked by Huginn and Muninn.

Then these became associated; and so gradually the middle section of the melody developed into the modern forms.|$|E

Although working Border Collie handlers sometimes have superstitions about the appearance of their dogs (handlers may avoid mostly white dogs due to the unfounded idea that sheep will not respect a white or almost all white dog), in general a dog's appearance is considered by the American Border Collie Association to be irrelevant. It is considered much more useful to identify a working Border Collie by its attitude and ability than by its looks.|$|E
