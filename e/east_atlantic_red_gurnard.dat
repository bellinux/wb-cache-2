40|$|Ontogenetic {{changes in}} the feeding habits and dietary overlap of the <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> Aspitrigla cuculus inhabiting the waters of North-East Atlantic were investigated. The feeding ecology of <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Triglidae) has been well studied in the Mediterranean Sea {{but there has been}} little {{research}} carried out on the feeding behaviour of these species in British waters since the 1930 ’s. Further analysis of the dietary habits of <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> in British waters is needed to understand the ontogenetic and seasonal changes in prey choice exhibited by the species and understand the implications of commercial fisheries on these fish and their prey, This study revealed that ontogenetic shifts were present in diet composition, niche breadth and dietary overlap of the <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> Aspitrigla cuculus. Large <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (> 20 cm) have a piscivorous diet and feed mainly on Callionymus lyra, whilst smaller gurnard prey predominantly upon benthic amphipods and carideans. Dietary overlap was highest between small red gurnard: ( 20 cm) having significantly different feeding habits than the small (< 14. 9 cm) and midsized sized (15 - 19. 9 cm) <b>red</b> <b>gurnard.</b> Temporal variation was observed in the feeding spectra of mid-sized <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> throughout the year. There has been a shift in the feeding behaviour of <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> between 1930 and 2004. The prey groups Galathea and Porcellana were the greatest contributors to the dissimilarity between dietary samples from 1930 and 2004...|$|R

40|$|The feeding {{habits of}} the three most {{abundant}} <b>gurnard</b> species, <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Aspitrigla cuculus), large scale gurnard (Lepidotrigla cavillone) and rock gurnard (Trigloporus lastoviza) in the eastern Mediterranean (Dodecanese and Cyclades, Greece) are examined. The stomach contents of the gurnard specimens collected in April and September 1996 by bottom trawling were analyzed. The % frequency of occurrence, % number and % weight of prey types in the stomach contents were evaluated. By weight, Mysidacea and Decapoda dominated in the diet of the three species in both seasons, however the Index of Relative Importance, {{as well as the}} percentage frequency of occurrence varied. Rock gurnard presented the most diverse diet whereas the diet of large scale and <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> were more specialized. High overlap in terms of number was found between rock and large scale gurnard in May. Rock gurnard had the most divers diet in both seasons...|$|R

40|$|International audienceTotal mercury {{concentrations}} were determined in different fish {{size classes of}} commercial importance such as, conger eel (Conger conger), starry ray (Raja asterias), forkbeard (Phycis blennoides), frostfish (Lepidopus caudatus), striped mullet (Mullus barbatus), <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (Aspitrigla cuculus) and yellow gurnard (Trigla lucerna) in order to evaluate eventual variations in consumer exposure to mercury {{as a function of}} fish consumption of different size spectra. The highest mean levels of total mercury were detected in conger eel (0. 80 μg g- 1) and in starry ray (0. 75 μg g- 1). Forkbeard (0. 67 μ g g- 1), frostfish (0. 59 gμ g- 1) and striped mullet (0. 55 μg g- 1) showed slightly lower levels, while <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> (0. 33 μg g- 1) and yellow gurnard (0. 22 μg g- 1) exhibited the lowest concentrations. The results of the linear regression analysis showed significant relationship between mercury concentrations and fish size for all species. Consequently, dietary consumption of larger size specimens leaded to an increase in the exposure level for consumer. Understanding by consumers of all factors leading to an increase of exposure to mercury is the first step to address them to make decisions about eating fish...|$|R
50|$|The <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> is {{native to}} the {{temperate}} eastern Atlantic Ocean and the Mediterranean Sea. Its range extends from southern Norway and Sweden southwards to the British Isles, France, Spain, Madeira, the Azores and the coast of Africa {{as far south as}} Mauritania. It is also present in the Mediterranean Sea and possibly the Black Sea. Its depth range is from the surface down to about 400 m but it is most usually found between 30 and 250 m. It is found over sand, shingle or rocky seabeds and feeds on bottom-dwelling invertebrates, such as crustaceans, and also small fish.|$|R

40|$|Back calculation, {{marginal}} increment {{analysis and}} modal progression analysis {{were used to}} trace growth processes of the <b>red</b> <b>gurnard,</b> Aspitrigla cuculus L., in the Mediterranean Sea. Three false rings appeared regularly on otoliths and were hypothesized {{to refer to the}} ontogeny {{on the basis of the}} study of the recruitment and reproduction processes of the species. The first two rings were laid down during the first pelagic period and the transformation to the bottom mode of life, respectively. The third ring corresponded to the first spawning at the end of the second year of life. The marginal increment analysis demonstrated that one opaque and one translucent zone is formed each year, the translucent ring corresponding to the period of slow growth in the winter. Temperature and salinity of Mediterranean waters below the thermocline where <b>red</b> <b>gurnard</b> live do not undergo seasonal variations. Therefore, traditional interpretation of the discontinuity patterns on otoliths related to the decrease of water temperature should be rejected for Mediterranean fish distributed on the deep shelf and slope. Discontinuities in otolith structure may be related to seasonal variation in feeding intensity as a consequence of decreases in the benthic mysids biomass and time available to find food due to reduced daylight. Future research should focus on the trophic ecology of the demersal fishes and the seasonal fluctuations of the prey resources during the year in order to assess the role of the food supply with regard to otolith growth patterns in the Mediterranean Sea...|$|R
40|$|We {{introduce}} a novel technique in which linear regression analysis {{is applied to}} clusters of tracked cyclones to statistically assess the factors controlling cyclone development. We illustrate this technique by evaluating the differences between cyclones forming {{in the west and}} <b>east</b> North <b>Atlantic</b> (herein termed west and <b>east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> cyclones). Enhanced cyclone intensity 2 [*]days after genesis is found to be associated with deeper upper-level troughs upstream of the cyclone center at the genesis time in both west and <b>east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> cyclones. However, whilst west Atlantic cyclones are also enhanced by the presence of strong fronts, <b>east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> cyclones are not. Instead, <b>east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> cyclones exhibit an enhancement when diabatically generated midlevel potential vorticity is present (with the enhancement being of approximately equal magnitude to that associated with the potential vorticity in the upper-level trough). This is consistent with the paradigm of latent heat release in the warm conveyor belt region playing {{an important role in the}} development of <b>east</b> <b>Atlantic</b> cyclones...|$|R
50|$|One {{cookbook}} gives as {{a typical}} assortment in a caldeirada conger eel, angel shark, sea bass or sea bream, <b>red</b> <b>gurnard,</b> sardines, ray, shrimp, and clams. One cookbook recommends about 11 ounces of fish per person. Other components of the dish include vegetables (such as potatoes, onions, green peppers, tomatoes, and tomato purée or tomato paste); spices (such as salt and black pepper, bay leaf, coriander, parsley, sweet paprika, or oregano), and other ingredients (such as vermicelli, olive oil, port wine, white wine, and whisky or brandy). Some recipes do not add salt to caldeirada, because the brininess of the shellfish already adds salt.|$|R
