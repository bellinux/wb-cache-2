5|$|The {{events of}} 1522 brought no {{clarification}} on the issues. Not {{only did the}} unrest between Zurich and the bishop continue, tensions were growing among Zurich's Confederation partners in the Swiss Diet. On 22 December, the Diet recommended that its members prohibit the new teachings, a strong indictment directed at Zurich. The city council <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> take the initiative and find its own solution.|$|E
5|$|Coolbrith {{had hoped}} to tour the East Coast and Europe with Miller, but stayed behind in San Francisco because she <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> care for {{her mother and her}} seriously ill, widowed sister Agnes who was unable to care for herself or for her two children. In late 1871 she took on the care of another {{dependent}} when Joaquin Miller brought her a teenaged Indian girl (widely rumored to be his own daughter) to care for while he went abroad again, this time to Brazil and Europe.|$|E
5|$|In the {{following}} days, around 2,000 Chetniks {{were in the}} district of Prozor. According to Partisan sources, they moved southeast to the Neretva River and Mostar at the request of Italian officers. Partisan sources claim that this was done because Chetnik and Italian atrocities caused great resentment in the local population, especially the Croatian Home Guard, which <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> intervene militarily in such instances. Chetnik commanders argued that this move was initiated by Germans to prevent the Chetniks from heading west towards Mount Dinara.|$|E

5|$|On May 16, 1775, Montgomery {{was elected}} {{as one of}} the ten deputies to {{represent}} Dutchess County in the New York Provincial Congress. Although Montgomery had only lived in New York for two years and had not sought political involvement, he was well known and respected in the area and he <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> attend. He was reluctant to go, but nonetheless went to New York City, 80 miles south of Rhinebeck.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} plan for SummerSlam {{was to bring}} Ric Flair over from the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) to the WWF. Vince McMahon, {{the owner of the}} WWF, wanted Flair to challenge Savage in the main event for the WWF Championship. Flair, however, <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> the NWA and did not leave the promotion for the WWF. Therefore, Hogan and Savage were paired together to end their feuds with their respective on-screen rivals. Flair would not join the WWF until 1991.|$|E
5|$|What may be {{revealed}} by Hori's {{attack on the}} way in which some Ramesside scribes <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> demonstrate their greater or lesser acquaintance with ancient literature is the conception that these venerable works were meant to be known in full and not to be misused as quarries for popular sayings mined deliberately from the past. The classics of the time were to be memorized completely and comprehended thoroughly before being cited.|$|E

60|$|Dr. May did not {{encounter}} the family dinner, nor attempt a second going to church; but Blanche was very glorious as {{she led him}} down to drink tea, and, before going up again, he {{had a conversation with}} Alan Ernescliffe, who <b>felt</b> himself <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> leave Stoneborough early on the morrow.|$|R
5|$|A {{group in}} Cambridge, which {{met at the}} White Horse tavern from the mid-1520s and became known as Little Germany, soon became influential. Its members {{included}} Robert Barnes, Hugh Latimer, John Frith and Thomas Bilney—all eventually burned as heretics. Cranmer's change of mind, borne partly by his membership of the team negotiating for the annulment, finally came through his stay with Andreas Osiander in Nuremberg in 1532. (Cranmer also secretly married Osiander's niece). Even then the position was {{complicated by the fact}} that Lutherans were not in favour of the annulment. Cranmer (and Henry) <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> seek assistance from Strasbourg and Basel, which brought him into contact with the more radical ideas associated with Zwingli.|$|E
5|$|Social {{commentary}} was {{a feature}} of Chaplin's films from early in his career, as he portrayed the underdog in a sympathetic light and highlighted the difficulties of the poor. Later, as he developed {{a keen interest in}} economics and <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> publicise his views, Chaplin began incorporating overtly political messages into his films. Modern Times (1936) depicted factory workers in dismal conditions, The Great Dictator (1940) parodied Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini and ended in a speech against nationalism, Monsieur Verdoux (1947) criticised war and capitalism, and A King in New York (1957) attacked McCarthyism.|$|E
5|$|The first Chelsea Bridge was {{proposed}} in the 1840s {{as part of a}} major development of marshlands on the south bank of the Thames into the new Battersea Park. It was a suspension bridge intended to provide convenient access from the densely populated north bank to the new park. Although built and operated by the government, tolls were charged initially in an effort to recoup the cost of the bridge. Work on the nearby Chelsea Embankment delayed construction and so the bridge, initially called Victoria Bridge, did not open until 1858. Although well-received architecturally, as a toll bridge it was unpopular with the public, and Parliament <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> make it toll-free on Sundays. The bridge was less of a commercial success than had been anticipated, partly because of competition from the newly built Albert Bridge nearby. It was acquired by the Metropolitan Board of Works in 1877, and the tolls were abolished in 1879.|$|E

50|$|After the French Revolution of 1848, {{and despite}} his own reluctance, {{he was elected to}} the Constituent Assembly by so large a number of votes (204,471) that he <b>felt</b> himself <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> accept the seat. Not long afterwards, with great difficulty, he {{obtained}} leave to resign. This was the last public event of Béranger's life.|$|R
50|$|Llywelyn, {{according}} to a letter he sent to the Archbishop of Canterbury John Peckham, {{was not involved in}} the planning of the revolt. He <b>felt</b> <b>obliged,</b> however, <b>to</b> support his brother and a war began for which the Welsh were ill-prepared. Personal tragedy also struck him at this time when, on or about 19 June 1282, his wife Eleanor de Montfort, died shortly after giving birth to their daughter Gwenllian.|$|R
5|$|In 1898, Sullivan, ageing and unwell, {{resigned}} as {{conductor of the}} Leeds triennial music festival, a post which he had held since 1880. He believed that Stanford's motive for accepting the conductorship of the Leeds Philharmonic Society the previous year was to position himself {{to take over the}} festival. Stanford later <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> write to The Times, denying that he had been party to a conspiracy to oust Sullivan. Sullivan was by then thought to be a dull conductor of other composers' music, and although Stanford's work as a conductor was not without its critics, he was appointed in Sullivan's place. He remained in charge until 1910. His compositions for the festival included Songs of the Sea (1904), Stabat Mater (1907) and Songs of the Fleet (1910). New works by other composers presented at Leeds during Stanford's years in charge included pieces by Parry, Mackenzie, and seven of Stanford's former pupils. The best-known new work from Stanford's time is probably Vaughan Williams's A Sea Symphony, premiered in 1910.|$|E
5|$|This support {{did indeed}} soon develop, when {{individuals}} or whole companies of men from across Western Europe {{volunteered for the}} Republic's army, while Christian rulers also <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> provide men, supplies and ships. The first French contingent of 4,200 men under Prince Almerigo d'Este arrived in April 1660, along with further contingents of German mercenaries, troops from Savoy, and Maltese, Tuscan and French ships. Despite this increase in strength, Morosini's operations in 1660 were a failure: an assault on Canea in August succeeded in taking the outlying fortifications but failed to retake the city itself; similarly, an attack against the Ottoman siege lines at Candia in September achieved some success, but did not break the Ottoman siege. Following the death of Prince d'Este at Naxos shortly after, the French contingent returned home, followed soon after by a disheartened Morosini, who was succeeded by his kinsman Giorgio. In 1661, Giorgio Morosini scored a few minor successes: he broke an Ottoman blockade of Tinos, and, pursuing the Ottoman fleet, defeated it off Milos. The next few years however were relatively idle. Although the Ottomans were heavily engaged with the Austrians in Hungary, and that their fleet rarely sallied forth, the Venetians failed {{to make use of}} this opportunity, and, except for the intercept of a supply convoy from Alexandria off Kos in 1662, there was little action.|$|E
25|$|Ecologist Professor Garrett Hardin {{claims that}} the {{preceding}} passage inspired hostile reactions from many critics. The offending passage of Malthus' essay appeared in the 2nd edition only, as Malthus <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> remove it.|$|E
60|$|Wulf {{was much}} pleased at {{the receipt of}} this letter, partly because {{the fact that he}} had been sent away in disgrace stung him, and he had <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> frankly <b>to</b> {{acknowledge}} to the neighbouring thanes that he had been sent down on account of a quarrel with a Norman page; but chiefly because it showed the kindly interest that Harold felt in him, and that although absent he had still thought of him.|$|R

60|$|We had {{scarcely}} finished supper when Jack Brandiger {{came to see}} me. He {{laughed a}} good deal a about my sudden change of base, but thought, on the whole, my house had made a very successful move. It must be more pleasant in the valley than up on that windy hill.

60|$|She was looked at, however, {{and with}} some admiration; for, in her own hearing, two gentlemen {{pronounced}} {{her to be a}} pretty girl. Such words had their due effect; she immediately thought the evening pleasanter than she had found it before--her humble vanity was contented--she <b>felt</b> more <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> the two young men for this simple praise than a true-quality heroine would have been for fifteen sonnets in celebration of her charms, and went to her chair in good humour with everybody, and perfectly satisfied with her share of public attention.|$|R
25|$|The {{next day}} Sandwich and Nassau {{captured}} the privateer Rencontre. Rencontre was armed with two 4-pounder guns {{and had a}} crew of 42 men.

25|$|The Second Austro-Sardinian {{war broke}} out in the summer of 1859. Leopold <b>felt</b> <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> espouse Austria's cause. Victor Emmanuel II of Sardinia {{captured}} Tuscany in its entirety, and held it {{for the duration of the}} conflict; Leopold fled Tuscany as a result. The Peace of Villafranca allowed Leopold to return once more. Upon arrival, he abdicated in favour of his elder son, Ferdinand. Ferdinand IV's hypothetical reign didn’t last long; the House of Habsburg-Lorraine was formally deposed by the National Assembly on 16 August 1859.|$|E

60|$|Smolensk, {{a town of}} {{considerable}} size, on the Dnieper, distant 280 miles from Moscow, {{was surrounded by a}} brick wall thirty feet high and eighteen feet thick at the base, with loopholed battlements. This wall formed a semicircle of about three miles and a half, the ends resting on the river. It was strengthened by thirty towers, and at its forts was a deep dry ditch. The town was largely built of wood. There were no heavy guns upon the walls, and the city, which was completely commanded by surrounding hills, was in no way defensible, but Barclay de Tolly <b>felt</b> himself <b>obliged</b> <b>to</b> fight.|$|R
