5|$|Skyscrapers are a {{relatively}} recent phenomenon in Japan. Due to aesthetic and engineering concerns, Japan's Building Standard Law set an absolute height limit of 31metres until 1963, when the limit was abolished {{in favor of a}} <b>Floor</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Ratio</b> limit. Following these changes in building regulations, the Kasumigaseki Building was constructed and completed in 1968. Double the height of Japan's previous tallest buildingthe 17-story Hotel New Otani Tokyothe Kasumigaseki Building is regarded as Japan's first modern high-rise building, rising 36stories and 156metres (512ft) in height. A booming post-war Japanese economy and the hosting of the 1964 Summer Olympics helped lead to a building boom in Tokyo during the 1960s and 1970s. Construction continued through the 1980s and 1990s as the Japanese asset price bubble rose and fell. Mainland Tokyo is divided into two sections: Western Tokyo and the special wards of Tokyo. All of the prefecture's tallest buildings are within the 23special wards, which comprise the area formerly incorporated as Tokyo City. Nishi-Shinjuku, a district within Shinjuku, was the prefecture's first major skyscraper development area. Starting with the construction of the Keio Plaza Hotel in the 1971, the district is now home to 11 of Tokyo's 40tallest skyscrapers.|$|E

5000|$|According to proponents, {{there must}} be a system of <b>Floor</b> <b>Area</b> <b>Ratios</b> to assure that the land and the {{services}} are not over pressured.

According to PIU proponents, Transfer of Development Rights benefits land owners whose properties have been reserved under the plan. It also benefits the local authorities that lack the financial resources to purchase lands to implement the Structure Plans. It benefits concentrated, city center project promoters who have to amortize expensive land purchases, by allowing them to purchase the development rights from the owners of reserved lands and to hand over those properties to the plan implementing authority. This allows the local authority to widen roads and to implement the Structure Plan. The local authority then transfers the needed development right to city center promoters.|$|R

Only recently have actions been taken on by the government to extend the growth boundaries, create new much needed urban layouts and address current issues by introducing new planning laws. However actual implementation of such actions for each municipality is usually expected to be complete in 5 years time, from the time that the government announced it.|$|R

50|$|Community District 4 was re-zoned, from West 30th Street to West 16th Street, between 10th and 11th Avenues. The re-zoning and {{creation}} of the Special West Chelsea District encouraged architects to design buildings that engaged and interacted with the new linear High Line pedestrian park. Adjacent developments to the High Line benefited from {{the creation of the}} High Line Transfer Corridor, or HLTC, which is intended to preserve light and air around the High Line. The HLTC transfers development rights from the air space around the High Line to designated receiving properties within the Special West Chelsea District. This program allowed developers of selected sites to increase the <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio,</b> or FAR. The Shutter House directly benefited from this program, which influenced the client and architect to rebuild, rather than renovate on the site. The Shutter House is located in an area that was re-zoned to a C6-2 zoning, which increased the <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> from 5.0 to a <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> of 6.0.

40|$|Abstract – Deep {{plans are}} a common {{practice}} in middle and high-rise office building design, and large open plans have become the preferred office layout by modern businesses due to {{the flexibility of the}} space and economic benefits achieved from maximum plot to gross <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratios.</b> Consequently, the deep core areas of these buildings cannot be naturally illuminated by side windows, and depend entirely on electricity for illumination. This paper describes the benefits of daylight piping technologies; in particular, hollow mirrored light pipes coupled with laser cut panel collectors to enhance natural illumination of deep plan office buildings. Light pipes are assessed by testing two scale models of buildings, one with horizontal and the other with vertical light pipes as daylight devices. Testing was carried out under sunny sky conditions and an artificial sky that closely simulates the CIE overcast sky. Results have shown that mirrored light pipes coupled with laser cut panels can achieve required values for ambient illumination in the core of buildings under sunny conditions, with an overall efficiency (input to output lumens) up to 32 %, but their performance drops under overcast conditions...|$|R

50|$|The footage {{which can}} be built-upon is {{regulated}} according to a system involving two figures: building coverage ratio (kenpeiritsu) and <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> (yōsekiritsu). Building coverage ratio is {{the ratio of the}} building footprint compared to the total area of the land. These two figures are often listed in advertisements for plots of land such as 70:400 (where 70 means the building coverage ratio is 70% and 400 is the <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> or 400%). This would mean that a 4 story home could be built using 70% of the land. Thus, for a maximum allowable coverage ratio of 50%, the greatest building footprint allowed for a lot of 100m2 would be 50m2. <b>Floor</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratio</b> is the total floor area of the house (excluding the roof and basement) as compared to the area of land the house is built upon; for a maximum FAR of 150%, the greatest possible total floor area for a house built on a 100m2 lot would be 150m2. Both maximum values vary according to the location of the land and width of facing roadway, with more built-up areas with wider roads generally allowing greater maximum floorspace, and building coverage dictated by factors such as frontage, nearby roads, and construction materials. Additionally, the number of floors in a structure may be restricted, in order to avoid excessive blockage of light to neighboring properties.|$|E
40|$|Discussions {{of urban}} density {{have long been}} central to {{theories}} relating urban form to city life. Both maximum and minimum measures of density {{have been linked to}} qualitative aspects of cities including health, safety, creativity, vitality and sustainability. Extensive research has produced a multiplicity of density concepts: densities of building bulk and floorspace; densities of dwellings, people and jobs; measured and perceived densities; interior and exterior; net and gross. From these are derived various density controls: <b>floor</b> <b>area</b> <b>ratios,</b> building envelopes, coverage and open space ratios. Despite research and practice of this kind, the modelling of interconnections between different concepts and measures has proven difficult. This paper proposes an integrative approach towards conceptualising urban density that seeks to clarify and to link key concepts within a loose framework of assemblage theory. In this model three fields of density measures – buildings, populations and open space – are integrated and related to questions of scale and urban intensity. Examples of suburban, urban, high-rise and informal morphologies are modelled to show how different density profiles emerge according to different measures. The model provides a basis for re-thinking density as a multiplicitous assemblage and in a manner applicable to any urban morphology...|$|R
40|$|Many Swedish as many European cities {{experienced}} a similar history of urbanization, architectural styles and planning paradigms.
