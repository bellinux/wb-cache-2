50|$|The {{theory that}} cherry-throated tanagers are hybrids between <b>hooded</b> and rufous-headed <b>tanagers</b> (Sibley 1996) was {{discussed}} by Scott (1997) who tentatively rejected it, but some even {{were convinced that}} the type specimen is an artifact composed from skins of other species (Silveira fide Bauer et al. 2000). The field data gathered since then supports {{the validity of the}} species, which was definitely rediscovered on February 22, 1998, at the Fazenda Pindobas IV, a privately owned tract of woodland NW of Conceição do Castelo (Bauer et al. 1998, Pacheco 1998).|$|R
