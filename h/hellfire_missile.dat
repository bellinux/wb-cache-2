5|$|The AH-64A then entered phase 2 of the AAH program {{under which}} three {{pre-production}} AH-64s would be built, additionally, the two YAH-64A flight prototypes {{and the ground}} test unit were upgraded to the same standard. Weapons and sensor systems were integrated and tested during this time, including the laser-guided AGM-114 <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile.</b> Development of the <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile</b> had begun in 1974, originally known {{by the name of}} Helicopter Launched, Fire and Forget Missile ('Hellfire' being a shortened acronym), for the purpose of arming helicopter platforms with an effective anti-tank missile.|$|E
5|$|Since recent {{orders of}} new AH-64Ds have been blocked, Israel has pursued {{upgrades}} to its AH-64A fleet. In June 2010, Israel {{decided not to}} upgrade all AH-64As to D configuration, due to funding constraints and lack of U.S. cooperation. In December 2010, the IAF was examining {{the adoption of a}} new missile system as a cheaper and lightweight complement to the <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile,</b> either the American Hydra 70 or the Canadian CRV7. In 2013, Israeli AH-64As had been receiving a comprehensive upgrade of their avionics and electrical systems. The AH-64As are being upgraded to the AH-64Ai configuration, which is near the AH-64D standard.|$|E
5|$|The Apache's first {{operational}} {{tour was}} {{as part of}} 16 Air Assault Brigade in Afghanistan; there were eight Apache AH1s deployed in Afghanistan in February 2007. These were drawn from No. 656 Squadron and No. 664 Squadron of 9 Regiment AAC, based at Dishforth Airfield. Unlike their American counterparts in Afghanistan, the Apache AH1 is deployed with its Longbow Fire Control Radar to enable the pilot to better manage traffic in their airspace. Initially pilots had to often fly for 16–18 {{hours at a time}} due to the low number of Apaches in the theatre; typically each Apache would be stationed in Afghanistan for eight weeks before returning to Britain for roughly eight weeks of maintenance. On 22 May 2006, a UK Apache operating in Afghanistan's Helmand province used a <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile</b> to destroy an abandoned French vehicle to protect sensitive equipment.|$|E

25|$|On 3 November 2002, a <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile</b> {{was fired}} at {{a car in}} Yemen, killing Qaed Salim Sinan al-Harethi, an al-Qaeda leader thought to be {{responsible}} for the USS Cole bombing. It was the first direct U.S. strike in the War on Terrorism outside Afghanistan.|$|E

25|$|The AH-64A then entered phase 2 of the AAH program. This {{called for}} {{building}} three preproduction AH-64s, and upgrading the two YAH-64A flight prototypes {{and the ground}} test unit up to the same standard.

25|$|On 16 February 2001 at Nellis Air Force Base, a Predator {{successfully}} fired three Hellfire AGM-114C missiles into a target. The newly armed Predators {{were given}} the designation of MQ-1A. In {{the first week of}} June 2001, a <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile</b> was successfully launched on a replica of bin Laden's Afghanistan Tarnak residence built at a Nevada testing site. A missile launched from a Predator exploded inside one of the replica's rooms; it was concluded that any people in the room would have been killed. On 4 September 2001 (after the Bush cabinet approved a Qaeda/Taliban plan), CIA chief Tenet ordered the agency to resume reconnaissance flights. The Predators were now weapons-capable, but didn't carry missiles because the host country (presumably Uzbekistan) hadn't granted permission.|$|E

25|$|In April 2004, the Government of Pakistan {{signed the}} first of three peace {{agreements}} with militants in South Waziristan. It was signed by militia commander Nek Muhammad Wazir, but was immediately abrogated once Nek Muhammad was killed by an American <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile</b> in June 2004. The second was signed in February 2005 with Nek's successor Baitullah Mehsud, which brought relative calm in the South Waziristan region. This deal would later, in September 2006, be mimicked in the neighboring North Waziristan territory as the third and final truce {{between the government and the}} militants. However, all of these truces would not have a substantial effect in reducing bloodshed. The latter two deals were officially broken in August 2007 with the start of Operation Silence which was initiated by Islamabad, and resulted in a tenfold increase in suicide attacks on Pakistan Armed Forces.|$|E
500|$|The AH-64 is {{adaptable}} to numerous different roles within its context as Close Combat Attack (CCA). In {{addition to the}} 30mm M230E1 Chain Gun, the Apache carries a range of external stores and weapons on its stub-wing pylons, typically a mixture of AGM-114 Hellfire anti-tank missiles, and Hydra 70 general-purpose unguided [...] rockets. An 18-aircraft Apache battalion can carry 288 Hellfire missiles, each capable of destroying a tank. Since 2005, the <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile</b> is sometimes outfitted with a thermobaric warhead; designated AGM-114N, it is intended for use against ground forces and urban warfare operations. The use of thermobaric [...] "enhanced blast" [...] weapons, such as the AGM-114N, has been a point of controversy. In October 2015, the U.S. Army ordered its first batch of Advanced Precision Kill Weapon System (APKWS) guided 70mm rockets for the Apache.|$|E
500|$|Upon fielding the Apache, {{capabilities}} such {{as using}} the FLIR for extensive night operations {{made it clear}} that it was capable of operating beyond the forward line of own troops (FLOT) to which previous attack helicopters were normally restricted. It was discovered that the Apache was coincidentally fitted with the Have Quick UHF radio system used by the U.S. Air Force, allowing inter-service coordination and joint operations such as the joint air attack teams (JAAT). The Apache have operated extensively with close air support (CAS) aircraft, such as the USAF's Fairchild Republic A-10 Thunderbolt II and the USMC's McDonnell Douglas AV-8B Harrier II, often acting as a target designator to conserve the Apache's own munitions. The Apache was first used in combat in 1989, during Operation Just Cause, the invasion of Panama. The AH-64 participated in over 240 hours of combat attacking various targets, mostly at night. General Carl Stiner, the commander of the operation, commented that: [...] "You could fire that <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile</b> through a window from four miles away at night".|$|E

500|$|In May and June 2008, British and Afghan National Army forces {{conducted}} Operation Eagle's Eye, {{aimed at}} disrupting Taliban activities {{to the south}} of Musa Qaleh; a key portion of which was a major night-time helicopter raid, rapidly deploying members of 2nd Battalion, Parachute Regiment into the town. In June 2008, a British Apache fired a thermobaric Hellfire missile; the controversial usage of such weapons was approved after extensive legal and ethical evaluations within the MoD. In June 2008, a Taliban leader and several cell members were killed in Helmand Province by a <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile</b> launched by an Apache of the 664 Army Air Corps. There was a friendly fire incident in July 2008, in which an Apache fired upon a position thought to be held by enemy forces, but instead hit members of a British patrol. This {{was the first time that}} a British aircraft had been involved in a blue-on-blue incident in Afghanistan. Although the Apaches have become targets for insurgents, [...] no British Apaches have been lost to enemy fire. In September 2008, an Apache was seriously damaged by a crash shortly after takeoff in Helmand province, no loss of life occurred but the airframe was written off.|$|E

By September 2013, 14 aircraft had been converted into gunships. [...] The conversion added a sensor package consisting of day/night video cameras with magnification capability.|$|E
2500|$|On 4 March 2002, a CIA-operated Predator fired a <b>Hellfire</b> <b>missile</b> into a {{reinforced}} Taliban {{machine gun}} bunker that had pinned down an Army Ranger team whose CH-47 Chinook had crashed {{on the top}} of Takur Ghar Mountain in Afghanistan. Previous attempts by flights of F-15 and F-16 Fighting Falcon aircraft were unable to destroy the bunker. This action took place during what has become known as the [...] "Battle of Roberts Ridge", a part of Operation Anaconda.
