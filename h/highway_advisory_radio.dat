25|$|Florida's Turnpike Enterprise is {{operating}} with an intelligent transportation systems (ITS), {{used to detect}} and manage incidents on the Enterprise's roadways. The ITS are managed by two traffic management centers (TMC), one located in Pompano Beach, and the other located in Ocoee, operated by Florida's Turnpike Enterprise 24 hours a day, seven days a week. The system, consisting of closed-circuit television (CCTV) traffic cameras, dynamic message signs (DMS), <b>highway</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>radio</b> (HAR), and radar vehicle detection system (RVDS), allow the TMC to see anything from congestion to crashes, to disabled vehicles that may {{pose a threat to}} the Turnpike's motorists. When necessary, the TMC will activate the dynamic message signs (DMS) and <b>highway</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>radio</b> stations (HAR) to alert motorists of the potential situation, as well as AMBER/Silver Alerts.|$|E
25|$|NYSTA also {{operates}} the Thruway Authority <b>Highway</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Radio</b> (HAR) system, {{a network of}} radio stations across the state that broadcast information on traffic conditions along the Thruway. The system broadcasts at 1610AM in the Buffalo, Rochester, Albany, Kingston, and Newburgh areas, 1620AM in the Finger Lakes and Syracuse areas, 530AM in the New York City metropolitan area, 540AM {{in the vicinity of}} Utica, and at 98.7FM in Chautauqua County. HAR is also used to broadcast Amber Alerts if one is issued.|$|E
25|$|An {{intelligent}} {{transportation system}} (ITS) {{is a system}} of hardware, software, and operators that allow better monitoring and control of traffic in order to optimize traffic flow. As the number of vehicle lane miles traveled per year continues to increase dramatically, and {{as the number of}} vehicle lane miles constructed per year has not been keeping pace, this has led to ever-increasing traffic congestion. As a cost-effective solution toward optimizing traffic, ITS presents a number of technologies to reduce congestion by monitoring traffic flows through the use of sensors and live cameras or analysing cellular phone data travelling in cars (floating car data) and in turn rerouting traffic as needed through the use of variable message boards (VMS), <b>highway</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>radio,</b> on board or off board navigation devices and other systems through integration of traffic data with navigation systems. Additionally, the roadway network has been increasingly fitted with additional communications and control infrastructure to allow traffic operations personnel to monitor weather conditions, for dispatching maintenance crews to perform snow or ice removal, as well as intelligent systems such as automated bridge de-icing systems which help to prevent accidents.|$|E
40|$|Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) {{have the}} {{potential}} to reduce crashes and increase mobility of transportation facilities. They also enhance productivity through the use of advanced communications technologies and their integration into vehicles and the transportation infrastructure. These systems involve a broad range of wireless and wire line communications-based information, electronics, or information processing technologies. Some of these technologies include cameras, variable message signs, ramp meters, road weather information systems, <b>highway</b> <b>advisory</b> <b>radios,</b> traffic management centers, and adaptive signal control technology (ASCT). ASCT is a traffic signal system that detects traffic conditions and adjusts signal timing remotely in response. More information on ASCT can be found at: www. fhwa. dot. gov/everydaycounts/technology/adsc The purpose and direction of ITS for the Washington State Department of Transportation (WSDOT) {{can be found in the}} Statewide Intelligent Transportation Systems Plan, which is available upon request from the Headquarters (HQ) Traffic Operations Office. The plan identifies the current and long-term ITS needs to meet the objectives identified in Moving Washington, WSDOT’s program to fight traffic congestion. The Statewide ITS Plan is a comprehensive document that discusses: • The history of ITS deployment in Washington. • How ITS meets WSDOT’s transportation vision and goals. • The current state of ITS deployment. • WSDOT’s near-term ITS plans. • How projects are prioritized. • What long-term ITS issues WSDOT needs to begin planning for. Due to the dynamic nature of ITS, printed guidance is soon outdated. Detailed design guidance and current practices are located on the following websites. For additional information an...|$|R

2500|$|Fog: The entire KY 9 {{corridor}} is {{plagued by}} fog, usually more than 60 days a year. A public education campaign may help. Visibility sensors and weather stations {{along the highway}} may help increase notification in these fog events. <b>Highway</b> <b>Advisory</b> <b>Radio</b> messages may also {{prove to be a}} benefit. Another major alternative would be the [...] "automated lane indication system," [...] which is similar to airport technology. Lighting installed in the pavement outlining the lane edges is [...] "activated automatically when heavy fog conditions are sensed. By having the lanes outlined, the lights greatly increase visibility conditions in times of heavy fog, thus creating safer operating conditions. Additionally, these lights are recessed into the pavement so as not to hinder snow removal operations. Since they are used at virtually every commercial airport in the United States, the lights are readily available and qualified installation services are easily attainable. This type of system has been used successfully in many locations, including Interstate 64 near Charlottesville, Virginia."
