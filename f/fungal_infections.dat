5|$|Another {{study has}} implicated EFS in the Chediak-Higashi {{syndrome}} (CHS). This rare and severe autosomal recessive disorder associated with partial albinism, peripheral neuropathy, mild coagulation defects and propensity to recurrent bacterial and <b>fungal</b> <b>infections,</b> caused by incomplete phagocytosis due to failure in phagolysosome formation. This work identified a direct interaction in vitro and in vivo between EFS and LYST (lysosomal trafficking regulator, aka CHS1 - Chediak-Higashi syndrome 1), a large protein that regulates the intracellular trafficking of proteins through endosomes that is mutated in CHS. These results may imply {{the role of}} EFS as a disease progression modifier, although further testing and establishment of mechanism is necessary.|$|E
5|$|Uropathogenic E. coli {{from the}} gut {{is the cause}} of 80–85% of community-acquired urinary tract infections, with Staphylococcus saprophyticus being the cause in 5–10%. Rarely they may be due to viral or <b>fungal</b> <b>infections.</b> Healthcare-associated urinary tract infections (mostly related to urinary catheterization) involve a much broader range of {{pathogens}} including: E. coli (27%), Klebsiella (11%), Pseudomonas (11%), the fungal pathogen Candida albicans (9%), and Enterococcus (7%) among others. Urinary tract infections due to Staphylococcus aureus typically occur secondary to blood-borne infections. Chlamydia trachomatis and Mycoplasma genitalium can infect the urethra but not the bladder. These infections are usually classified as a urethritis rather than urinary tract infection.|$|E
40|$|Objective: Determine the clinicopathological {{findings}} in autopsy cases with invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infection.</b> Material and Method: The autopsy and medical records with invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> in Ramathibodi Hospital between January 1997 and December 2006 were analyzed. The criterions for {{the diagnosis of}} invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> were the evidence of fungal elements from histopathological section. The age, gender, underlying predisposing risk factors for the disease, clinical manifestations, extent of systemic organ involve-ment documented morphologically at autopsy, and fungal culture were analyzed. Results: There were 155 autopsy cases (73 male, 82 female; mean age 45. 3 years, range 3 months to 87 years) with the diagnosis of invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infection.</b> The common clinical presentations were fever (55. 5 %), and dyspnea (26. 5 %). The invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> was associated with hematologic malignancy in 31 %. The common mycoses were aspergillosis and candidiasis, which were observed in 88 and 80 cases, respectively. There were 32 cases (20. 6 %) of mixed <b>fungal</b> <b>infection.</b> Cultures from autopsy materials were positive for fungus in 80 cases out of 99 cases (80. 8 %). The most frequent site of <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> was in the lungs (74. 8 %), followed by gastrointestinal tract (28. 4 %), and brain (26. 5 %). Invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> was diagnosed intravitally in 63. 9 % of total cases. Conclusion: A diagnosis of invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> requires a high index of suspicion, especially i...|$|R

5|$|Some parasites feed on giraffes. They {{are often}} hosts for ticks, {{especially}} {{in the area around}} the genitals, which has thinner skin than other areas. Tick species that commonly feed on giraffes are those of genera Hyalomma, Amblyomma and Rhipicephalus. Giraffes may rely on red-billed and yellow-billed oxpeckers to clean them of ticks and alert them to danger. Giraffes host numerous species of internal parasite and are susceptible to various diseases. They were victims of the (now eradicated) viral illness rinderpest. Giraffes can also suffer from a skin disorder, which {{comes in the form of}} wrinkles, lesions or raw fissures. It appears to be caused by a nematode and may be further effected by <b>fungal</b> <b>infections.</b> As much as 79% of giraffes show signs of the disease in Ruaha National Park.|$|E
5|$|When {{used for}} short periods, {{linezolid}} {{is a relatively}} safe drug. Common side effects of linezolid use (those occurring in more than 1% of people taking linezolid) include diarrhea (reported by 3–11% of clinical trial participants), headache (1–11%), nausea (3–10%), vomiting (1–4%), rash (2%), constipation (2%), altered taste perception (1–2%), and discoloration of the tongue (0.2–1%). <b>Fungal</b> <b>infections</b> such as thrush and vaginal candidiasis may also occur as linezolid suppresses normal bacterial flora and opens a niche for fungi (so-called antibiotic candidiasis). Less common (and potentially more serious) adverse effects include allergic reactions, pancreatitis, and elevated transaminases, which {{may be a sign}} of liver damage. Unlike some antibiotics, such as erythromycin and the quinolones, linezolid has no effect on the QT interval, a measure of cardiac electrical conduction. Adverse effects in children are similar to those that occur in adults.|$|E
5|$|Often farmers {{would leave}} a solitary cabbage tree—or even groves of trees—standing after the swamps were drained. Most of these trees will slowly die out because {{livestock}} eat the seedlings and damage the trunks and roots of adult trees. When a cabbage tree {{is the only}} shade in a field, stock will shelter underneath it, damaging the bark by rubbing against it, and compacting the soil around the tree. Cows, sheep, goats, and deer eat the nutritious tissue under the bark of cabbage trees. Once the trunk has been damaged by animals, it seldom heals and the wounds get bigger over time. Eventually the tissue in {{the centre of the}} stem rots away and a cavity forms along its entire length. The trunk becomes misshapen or completely ring-barked for a metre above the ground. Often the growth layer dies and the injuries may lead to bacterial or <b>fungal</b> <b>infections</b> that spread into the branches until the canopy too begins to die. Other factors thought to contribute to Rural Decline include wood-rotting fungi like Phanerochaete cordylines, micro-organisms which cause saprobic decay and leaf-feeding caterpillars.|$|E

40|$|Techniques for the {{diagnosis}} of invasive <b>fungal</b> <b>infection,</b> including antigen testing, nucleic acid detection and radiological imaging, have improved greatly in recent years. They {{have the potential to}} impact on patient management through replacing empirical antifungal strategies with targeted and pre-emptive therapy. Factors that influence performance of these diagnostic tests include underlying disease, the prevalence of <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> in particular populations and prophylactic antifungal drug strategies. Understanding these factors is necessary for rational use of antifungal agents and optimal management and prevention of <b>fungal</b> <b>infection</b> in immunosuppressed patients...|$|R

5|$|Many species produce {{metabolites}} {{that are}} {{major sources of}} pharmacologically active drugs. Particularly important are the antibiotics, including the penicillins, a structurally related group of β-lactam antibiotics that are synthesized from small peptides. Although naturally occurring penicillins such as penicillin G (produced by Penicillium chrysogenum) have a relatively narrow spectrum of biological activity, {{a wide range of}} other penicillins can be produced by chemical modification of the natural penicillins. Modern penicillins are semisynthetic compounds, obtained initially from fermentation cultures, but then structurally altered for specific desirable properties. Other antibiotics produced by fungi include: ciclosporin, commonly used as an immunosuppressant during transplant surgery; and fusidic acid, used to help control infection from methicillin-resistant Staphylococcus aureus bacteria. Widespread use of antibiotics for the treatment of bacterial diseases, such as tuberculosis, syphilis, leprosy, and others began in the early 20th century and continues to date. In nature, antibiotics of fungal or bacterial origin appear to play a dual role: at high concentrations they act as chemical defense against competition with other microorganisms in species-rich environments, such as the rhizosphere, and at low concentrations as quorum-sensing molecules for intra- or interspecies signaling. Other drugs produced by fungi include griseofulvin isolated from Penicillium griseofulvum, used to treat <b>fungal</b> <b>infections,</b> and statins (HMG-CoA reductase inhibitors), used to inhibit cholesterol synthesis. Examples of statins found in fungi include mevastatin from Penicillium citrinum and lovastatin from Aspergillus terreus and the oyster mushroom.|$|E
