25|$|<b>Disengagement</b> <b>theory</b> is {{the idea}} that {{separation}} of older people from active roles in society is normal and appropriate, and benefits both society and older individuals. <b>Disengagement</b> <b>theory,</b> first proposed by Cumming and Henry, has received considerable attention in gerontology, but has been much criticised. The original data on which Cumming and Henry based the theory were from a rather small sample of older adults in Kansas City and from this select sample Cumming and Henry then took disengagement to be a universal theory. There are research data suggesting that the elderly who do become detached from society are those who were initially reclusive individuals and such disengagement is not purely a response to ageing.|$|E
25|$|Activity theory, in {{contrast}} to <b>disengagement</b> <b>theory,</b> implies that the more active elderly people are, {{the more likely they}} are to be satisfied with life. The view that elderly adults should maintain well-being by keeping active has had a considerable history and since 1972, this has come to be known as activity theory. However, this theory may be just as inappropriate as disengagement for some people as the current paradigm on the psychology of ageing is that both <b>disengagement</b> <b>theory</b> and activity theory may be optimal for certain people in old age, depending on both circumstances and personality traits of the individual concerned. There are also data which query whether, as activity theory implies, greater social activity is linked with well-being in adulthood.|$|E

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study is to examine how {{activities}} are looked upon, organized and put into practice at homes designed for the elderly. To achieve this we have done a survey study, based upon the caregiver´s point of view regarding the subject activity. The result of this study has been interpreted and analyzed with help from the engagement- and <b>disengagement</b> <b>theories.</b> The result shows us that the caregiver´s find the term activity slightly abstract, and rather difficult to define. All of the caregiver´s did agree on the matter that it’s good to activate elderly people and that the elderly people are activated at a large extent. The result also shows us that it’s not always the elderly people’s own wishes and desires of activity that gets organized and put into practice at homes designed for the elderly. In conclusion we find the engagement theory to be very dominant in the thoughts and actions of caregiver´s in Swedish geriatric care, rather than the <b>disengagement</b> <b>theories...</b>|$|R
40|$|Explanatory {{problems}} of activity and <b>disengagement</b> <b>theories</b> of aging necessitate a re-examination of their theoretical {{assumptions about the}} social behavior of old people together with propositions and hypotheses. As an out-come of intensive interviews with 210 persons, age 60 to 94, in various types of residential settings, a new socio-environ-mental theory of aging is proposed. The theory is built around the inter-relationship of two conceptual components: (I) environ-mental effects such as social homogeneity, residential proximity, and local protectiveness; and (2) personal resources influencing behavior flexibility such as health, solvency, and education. Specific attention is given to a socio-environmental approach to criminal victimization in old age, with suggested hypotheses...|$|R

2500|$|<b>Disengagement</b> <b>theory</b> was {{developed}} by Cumming and Henry. According to this theory, older adults and society engage in a mutual separation from each other. An example of mutual separation is retirement from the workforce. A key assumption of this theory is that older adults lose [...] "ego-energy" [...] and become increasingly self-absorbed. Additionally, disengagement leads to higher morale maintenance than if older adults try to maintain social involvement. This theory is heavily criticized for having an escape clause - namely, that older adults who remain engaged in society are unsuccessful adjusters to old age.|$|E
40|$|Digital {{music piracy}} has persisted as a contested form of online {{deviance}} {{for more than}} two decades, garnering social, industry, and legislative responses. This dissertation outlines an integrated approach to explain this form of deviance through a combination of the networked society, social learning, and moral <b>disengagement</b> <b>theories.</b> This approach was developed based on three hypotheses; first, that technological competency defines online experience; second, that online experiences dictate the form of social learning encountered by users; and third, users’ social learning experiences shape the way they neutralize their deviance. The hypotheses were empirically tested using a data set of 616 cases drawn from a self-administered online survey. Linear regression analyses were conducted for each test and statistically significant models as well as linkages were developed for each hypothesis; however, moderately strong findings in some cases suggest that additional theory considerations should be made. This dissertation concludes with a discussion of the study’s implications, particularly as they relate to an increasingly pluralistic internet...|$|R
40|$|Much recent {{attention}} has focussed on the structured dependency {{of the elderly}} in modern society, particularly on their reliance on the public sector for economic support. This article explores the notion of dependency on both informal and formal sources of care, for reasons of physical and mental, as well as economic, disadvantage. This broader concept of dependency forms the basis for re-examination of the social creation of dependency amongst the elderly, drawing on illustrations from Australian health and welfare programs. Current social welfare practices are shown to structure and increase the dependency which those elderly in need of some government assistance are likely to experience. The need for increased flexibility in welfare provision and increased autonomy for the individual is emphasized, and an expanded range of service provision posited as a strategy to reduce both dependency itself, and its negative consequences for social welfare recipients. DEFINING DEPENDENCY Social scientists have recently contended that much dependency amongst the elderly is societally, rather than individually, determined. In particular, {{it has been argued}} that social policies have actively created dependency in older age groups, primarily through work-force exclusion (Kinnear, Graycar and Adamson, 1982; Townsend, 1981 and Walker, 1980). This development is part of a more general trend in the study of ageing away from a strong focus on individualistic explanations (such as activity and <b>disengagement</b> <b>theories)</b> and toward an emphasis on societal determinants and constraints. 1 Moreover, it reflects an established concern in the field of social policy with the role that governments play in shaping the character of a society, and th...|$|R
50|$|As {{mentioned}} above, valence is {{the degree}} of positivity or negativity in expected information. Relational outcomes will become negatively valenced when violations occur within the six schemata. Negative valence here {{can be associated with}} the amount of relationships we initially form and the amount of relationships that become long lasting. Andersen’s cognitive valence theory points out (under relational outcome) how violations of any of the six schemata will affect a dyad relationship. Negative violations can result in (1) negative cognitive and affective appraisals of your partner; (2) compensation/reduction intimacy behaviors, and (3) reductions in relational closeness or <b>disengagement.</b> The <b>theory</b> further describes the degree of positivity associated with positive relational outcomes within a dyad relationship. Andersen’s cognitive valence theory also points that (under relational outcome) how positive valenced intimacy can show (1) positive cognitive and affective appraisals of one’s partner; (2) reciprocity or an increase in intimacy behaviors, and (3) increase in relational growth and closeness.|$|R

40|$|People {{can become}} outraged {{by what they}} {{perceive}} as injustice, like torture or aggressive war, and sometimes this stimulates social action. Perpetrators of such actions regularly use a number of methods, such as cover-up and reinterpretation, to minimise outrage. The struggle between powerful perpetrators and challengers over reactions to occurrences potentially perceived as unfair can be called the dynamics of outrage. Psychology is a crucial factor in such struggles, but there has been no study of psychological perspectives relevant to outrage dynamics. We survey several psychological theories - Freudian psychoanalysis, just world theory, Bandura 2 ̆ 7 s <b>theory</b> of moral <b>disengagement,</b> reactance <b>theory,</b> balance theory and studies of persuasion - that seem relevant to outrage dynamics. These theories, among others, offer insights about why and when people become outraged and about the tactics of devaluation, reinterpretation and use of official channels used by perpetrators to minimise outrage. Insights about the psychology of outrage dynamics can assist activists opposing injustice...|$|R
40|$|Socio-economic, -demographic, and {{cultural}} factors {{have a major}} impact on the elderly's leisure patterns. Korea has developed rapidly in a short period of time which makes it hard for the contemporary elderly to keep up with the changes. This can affect their leisure lives after retirement and thus their satisfaction with life. This-research examines how the elderly's leisure patterns change following retirement, and its role alongside socio-economic and demographic factors influencing life satisfaction. The socio-economic anddemographic factors included in the analysis are gender, age, occupation education, cohabitation, irregular work, health status, and income. The data is intended to be a foundation and stepping stone for developing an elderly leisure policy and an elderly leisure education system for Korea, The research comprised a survey of 120 persons in the Gang- N am region of Seoul in South Korea. Male and Female participants aged 50 and over were selected as a sample. For measuring leisure participation, 20 leisure activities 'were utilised from the White Paper on Leisure 2008 conducted by the Ministry of Culture and Tourism, and they were further grouped into 7 categories by Classification of Leisure Activities based on Edginton, Compton, and Hanson's (1990) research. The main findings are as follows. Continuity is the most common trend in leisure activity after retirement rather than developments predicted by activity and <b>disengagement</b> <b>Theories.</b> Socio-economic factors such as income, occupation, education, cohabitation, and health condition influence the elderly's leisure activity patterns as well as their life satisfaction. Men seemed to be more leisure active than women, the younger compared to the older, and the better educated than the less educated. All the various groups in the research reported increased levels of activity since they had retired. Life satisfaction scores were the lowest among those who were / living alone, and those with chronic health conditions. However, as with leisure participation, all the groups reported an upward trend in life satisfaction after retirement. The increased satisfaction was mainly due to increased social participation. It was mainly the individuals who continued or increased their participation in leisure activities which they practised prior to retirement who showed a boost in their life satisfaction.

40|$|This {{research}} aims to fill {{an important}} gap in focusing on why individuals {{are able to}} take part in and/or support activities that have effects on economic, environmental, and social dimensions that are not consistent with their sense of right and wrong. The research focuses on the relationship between supply chain management and moral disengagement, and how this relation affects social responsibility. After observing individuals avoiding responsibility for misconduct an explanatory concept, moral decoupling, was proposed. Moral decoupling considers moral responsibility a flow in the supply chain. Moral decoupling occurs when the flow is restricted. If moral decoupling occurs at an identifiable point it is called a moral decoupling point. The concept was developed by identifying and linking specific supply chain activities and structures with moral <b>disengagement,</b> a <b>theory</b> that explains the deactivation of self regulation. Moral decoupling was able to suggest how to reduce moral disengagement and improve social responsibility. To validate the suggestions a literature review on social responsibility was conducted and identified sixteen elements of social responsibility in supply chain management. The suggestions based on moral disengagement were compared with elements of social responsibility and a large overlap was found. Lastly, suggestions on how to reduce moral disengagement and map moral responsibility in a supply network are proposed, links between elements of social responsibility are presented, and moral coupling is added as a complementary term to moral decoupling. A model explaining the relationship between ethical guidelines, moral responsibility, moral decoupling, and social responsibility is proposed. In relation to current theoretical knowledge the thesis has contributed to the field of socially responsible supply chain management with an application of a new theoretical lens that gives one explanation as to why identifed elements of social responsibility are important. The understanding of social responsibility has reached an increased explanatory depth following the identification of moral disengagement as a generative mechanism, subject to conditions in supply chain management. The research has also applied moral disengagement in a context not identified in earlier research, and shows some of the complexity of applying it to a real-world global context. The elements of social responsibility and moral (de) coupling help practitioners identify what they should focus on to increase social responsibility and also offer an explanation for `why?'. The findings can be used to construct supply chains that are less prone to misconduct and to identify where in the chain {{it is important to be}} aware of immoral behavior. The value and originality of this research is centered on the application of a new theoretical lens for socially responsible supply chain management. It is the only identified research in the area which identifies mechanisms on a generative level that explains human behavior and conditions to which those mechanisms are subject. This is also in itself a novel application of moral disengagement in a new research context.
