5|$|The {{object of}} the compilers of these {{charters}} was to express their meaning {{by the use of}} the greatest possible number of words and by the choice of the most grandiloquent, bombastic words they could find. Every sentence is so overloaded by the heaping up of unnecessary words that the meaning is almost buried out of sight. The invocation with its appended clauses, opening with pompous and partly alliterative words, will proceed amongst a blaze of verbal fireworks throughout twenty lines of smallish type, and the pyrotechnic display will be maintained with equal magnificence throughout the whole charter, leaving the reader, <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> the glaze and blinded by the smoke, in a state of uncertainty as to the meaning of these frequently untranslatable and usually interminable sentences.|$|E

Sobers was fined £10 with £16 17s costs and had his licence suspended for a month. Sobers pleaded not guilty, claiming that he had been <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> oncoming headlights..|$|E

25|$|The {{portrayal}} of Rohirrim reinforcements and Gandalf {{at the end}} of the battle differ; in the novel they are infantry led by Erkenbrand (while Éomer had fought at the Hornburg alongside Aragorn), whereas in the film they are cavalry led by Éomer. While Tolkien wrote that the Orcs were already demoralized by Théoden's cavalry charge before Gandalf arrived, the film encounter is somewhat more dramatic with the Orcs forming up an organized sheltron against the charging Rohirrim horseman but at last minute the Orcs' line falters after they are <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> sunlight.|$|E
25|$|The Phantom's {{service as}} a {{frontline}} fighter would be short-lived. Its limited range and light armament– notably, its inability to carry bombs– made it best suited for duty as a point-defence interceptor aircraft. However, its speed and rate of climb were only slightly better than existing propeller-powered fighters and fell short of other contemporary jets, such as the Lockheed P-80 Shooting Star, prompting concerns that the Phantom would be outmatched by future enemy jets it might soon face. Moreover, recent experience in World War II had demonstrated the value of naval fighters that could double as fighter-bombers, a capability the Phantom lacked. Finally, the aircraft exhibited some design deficiencies– its navigational avionics were poor, it could not accommodate newly developed ejection seats, {{and the location of}} the machine guns in the upper nose caused pilots to be <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> muzzle flash.|$|E
25|$|However, Charlotte did {{not allow}} herself to be discouraged. Furthermore, {{coincidence}} came to her aid. One day in autumn 1845 while alone {{in the dining room}} she noticed a small notebook lying open on in the drawer of Emily's portable writing desk and of my sister Emily's handwriting. She read it and was <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> the beauty of the poems that she did not know. The discovery of this treasure was what she recalled five years later, and according to Juliet Barker, she erased the excitement that she had felt, more than surprise , a deep conviction that these were not common effusions, nor at all like the poetry women generally write. I thought them condensed and terse, vigorous and genuine. To my ear, they had a peculiar music – wild, melancholy, and elevating. In the following paragraph Charlotte describes her sister's indignant reaction at her having ventured into such an intimate realm with impunity. It took Emily hours to calm down and days to be convinced to publish the poems.|$|E

500|$|The two men found much in common: Hitler {{spoke of}} Speer as a [...] "kindred spirit" [...] {{for whom he}} had always {{maintained}} [...] "the warmest human feelings". The young, ambitious architect was <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> his rapid rise and close proximity to Hitler, which guaranteed him a flood of commissions {{from the government and}} from the highest ranks of the Party. Speer testified at Nuremberg, [...] "I belonged to a circle which consisted of other artists and his personal staff.

They withdraw, and Josephine enters, still feeling guilty about her planned elopement with Ralph and fearful of giving up a life of luxury.

The Captain and Sir Joseph rejoice, but Josephine is now more determined than ever to marry Ralph.|$|E
500|$|In a very {{positive}} review for The Village Voice, Robert Christgau called A Thousand Leaves a mature and beautiful record, commenting: [...] "It's the music of a daydream nation old enough to treasure whatever time it finds on its hands. Where a decade ago [...] plunged and plodded, drunk on the forward notion of the van they were stuck in, here they wander at will, <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> sunshine, greenery, hoarfrost and machines that go squish in the night." [...] Although the album was not ranked in the Top 40 of The Village Voices Pazz & Jop critics' poll for 1998, Christgau, the poll's creator, placed it at No. 3 in his own [...] "Dean's List". He would later name {{it one of the}} 10 best records of the 1990s. Similarly, the editors of NME placed the album at No. 40 in their year-end top 50 list.|$|E

500|$|In India, {{the film}} {{received}} mostly positive reviews from critics. Taran Adarsh of Bollywood Hungama gave 4.5 out of 5 stars, reporting [...] "On the whole, Dhoom 2 {{is a winner}} all the way. For Yash Raj, who've not only produced but also distributed the film, Dhoom 2 should emerge {{as one of the}} biggest hits of their career." [...] Rajesh Karkera of Rediff gave it three and a half stars out of five, calling it [...] "A complete roller-coaster ride which left me completely enthralled and exhausted. Sure, there are faults when you stop to think rationally. But that does not stop you from being <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> the film." [...] Rajeev Masand of CNN-IBN gave it a three star rating, saying that Dhoom 2 is without doubt better than its predecessor, and that Hrithik Roshan is {{the heart and soul of}} the film. Vijay Venkataramanan of Planet Bollywood gave it seven out of ten stars; while complaining about flaws in the plot and Aishwarya Rai’s performance, he still called it a good adrenaline-pumping entertainer.|$|E
500|$|Clarkson and Gill {{performed}} the {{song for the}} first time on the 46th Annual Country Music Association Awards on November 1, 2012. Their performance earned positive reviews; Grady Smith of Entertainment Weekly deemed it as [...] "smoky, smooth, soulful, and understated". Natalie Finn of E! noted that their performance of [...] "Don't Rush" [...] reminisces [...] "Islands in the Stream", and welcomed Clarkson's venture to country music. Story Gilmore of Neon Limelight remarked, [...] "The two stars <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> simply singing, and singing well for their performance. Kelly sang flawlessly alongside Vince as the country icon strummed on his guitar while adding smooth vocals." [...] The song's accompanying music video is composed of the live footage from the Country Music Association awards which was directed by Glenn Weiss. On February 28, 2013, Clarkson took the stage to perform the single during the Country Radio Seminar concert. Wearing a T-shirt with the logo of Drug Abuse Resistance Education, she was joined by Jason Sellers who sang Gill's part. Clarkson also {{performed the}} song on the Academy of Country Music Awards on April 7, 2013, again with Sellers singing Gill's part.|$|E
500|$|Some of {{the most}} {{unfavorable}} reviews came from major American newspapers. A.O. Scott of The New York Times describes 300 as [...] "about as violent as Apocalypto and twice as stupid," [...] while criticizing its color scheme and suggesting that its plot includes racist undertones; Scott also poked fun at the buffed bodies of the actors portraying the Spartans, declaring that the Persian characters are [...] "pioneers {{in the art of}} face-piercing", but that the Spartans had access to [...] "superior health clubs and electrolysis facilities". Kenneth Turan writes in the Los Angeles Times that [...] "unless you love violence as much as a Spartan, Quentin Tarantino or a video-game-playing teenage boy, you will not be endlessly fascinated." [...] Roger Ebert, in his review, gave the film a two-star rating, writing, [...] "300 has one-dimensional caricatures who talk like professional wrestlers plugging their next feud." [...] Some critics employed at Greek newspapers have been particularly critical, such as film critic Robby Eksiel, who said that moviegoers would be <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> the [...] "digital action" [...] but irritated by the [...] "pompous interpretations and one-dimensional characters." ...|$|E

[...] There was still no fuel gauge, but the 12 British gallons (15 US gallons) of tank capacity gave a range between refuelling stops of about 300 miles (480 km) and a green light on the facia flashed a [...] "warning" [...] when the fuel level was down to about 2½ British gallons (>3 US gallons / >11 litres).|$|R

500|$|The pair {{discussed}} {{having an}} Act 1 musical scene involving Anna and the King's wives. [...] The lyrics for that scene {{proved to be}} very difficult for Hammerstein to write. [...] He first thought that Anna would simply tell the wives something about her past, and wrote such lyrics as [...] "I was <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> the splendor/Of Calcutta and Bombay" [...] and [...] "The celebrities were many/And the parties very gay/(I recall a curry dinner/And a certain Major Grey)." [...] Eventually, Hammerstein decided to write about how Anna felt, a song which would not only explain her past and her motivation for traveling with her son to the court of Siam, but also serve to establish a bond with Tuptim and lay the groundwork for the conflict that devastates Anna's relationship with the King. [...] "Hello, Young Lovers", the resulting song, was the work of five exhausting weeks for Hammerstein. [...] He finally sent the lyrics to Rodgers by messenger and awaited his reaction. [...] Hammerstein considered the song his best work and was anxious to hear what Rodgers thought of it, but no comment came from Rodgers. [...] Pride kept Hammerstein from asking. [...] Finally, after four days, the two happened to be talking on the phone about other matters, {{and at the end of}} the conversation, Rodgers stated, very briefly, that the lyric was fine. [...] Josh Logan, who had worked closely with Hammerstein on South Pacific, listened to the usually unflappable writer pour out his unhappy feelings. [...] It was one of the few times that Hammerstein and Rodgers did not display a united front.|$|E
500|$|Magnussen ran wide {{onto the}} first-turn run-off area on lap 38 but rejoined without spinning, and Vergne {{went off the}} track at the second corner. Vettel ran wide off the circuit and into the gravel trap at the S-turns during that lap, {{allowing}} Button to close in on him. Ricciardo closed the gap to Button that lap and attempted to pass him around the inside at the hairpin; Button defended his position, and Ricciardo ran wide. Hamilton recorded the fastest overall lap time of the race during the 39th lap, completing a circuit of one minute and 51.600 seconds. DRS was disabled on lap 41 because weather conditions continued to deteriorate. Visibility was reduced due to fading light and low cloud cover; drivers were <b>dazzled</b> <b>by</b> lights on their steering wheels. Ricciardo attempted to pass Button again that lap by taking the inside lane into the hairpin, but Button took a wide line. He passed Button at the hairpin to move into fourth position on the 42nd lap, and Button made a pit stop for full wet tyres. Sutil lost control of his car due to aquaplaning, spun and collided with the outside tyre barrier {{at the top of}} the hill at Dunlop Curve on the lap. Double yellow flags were waved at the corner to warn drivers about the incident, and Whiting did not use the safety car. Sutil's car was extracted from the track by a tractor crane that lap and turned backwards toward a gap in the barrier. Bianchi lost control of his Marussia at [...] on lap 43, veering right towards the run-off area outside the Dunlop Curve. Although he applied his throttle and brake pedals simultaneously, his fail-safe system did not work because the settings of his brake-by-wire system were incompatible.|$|E
