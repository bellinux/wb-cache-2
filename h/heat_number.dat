50|$|OTK's largest {{production}} facilities are the integrated steel mills of the Tornio Works, {{in the small}} Finnish town Tornio {{on the coast of}} Gulf of Bothnia. Tornio Works produces hot rolled and cold rolled coils and sheets cut from coil, with an annual output of one million tonnes. The site consists of ferrochromium smelting, two steel-melting shops, a hot rolling mill and two cold rolling mills. The steel works were built in 1975-1976. The first stainless cast was made in May 1976, week 19, thus it has got the <b>heat</b> <b>number</b> 61901.The main marketing area is the EU.

50|$|When the alloys for piping are forged, {{metallurgical}} {{tests are}} performed to determine material composition by % of each chemical {{element in the}} piping, {{and the results are}} recorded in a Material Test Report (MTR). These tests can be used to prove that the alloy conforms to various specifications (e.g. 316 SS). The tests are stamped by the mill's QA/QC department and can be used to trace the material back to the mill by future users, such as piping and fitting manufacturers. Maintaining the traceability between the alloy material and associated MTR is an important quality assurance issue. QA often requires the <b>heat</b> <b>number</b> to be written on the pipe. Precautions must also be taken to prevent the introduction of counterfeit materials. As a backup to etching/labeling of the material identification on the pipe, positive material identification (PMI) is performed using a handheld device; the device scans the pipe material using an emitted electromagnetic wave (x-ray fluorescence/XRF) and receives a reply that is spectrographically analyzed.|$|E
5000|$|In {{regard to}} materials, {{traceability}} {{refers to the}} capability to associate a finished part with destructive test results performed on material from the same ingot with the same heat treatment, or to associate a finished part with results of a test performed on a sample from the same melt identified by the unique lot number of the material. Destructive tests typically include chemical composition and mechanical strength tests. A <b>heat</b> <b>number</b> is usually marked on the part or raw material which identifies the ingot it came from, and a lot number may identify the group of parts that experienced the same heat treatment (i.e., {{were in the same}} oven at the same time). Material traceability is important to the aerospace, nuclear, and process industry because they frequently make use of high strength materials that look identical to commercial low strength versions. In these industries, a part made of the wrong material is called [...] "counterfeit," [...] even if the substitution was accidental.|$|E

40|$|Fatigue cracks {{may start}} {{early in the}} life of {{cyclically}} loaded structural components and the useful life is determined by the rate at which these fatigue cracks propagate in the component. Fatigue crack propagation rate {{has been shown to be}} a function of the elastic stress intensity range and stress ratio, R, (ratio of the minimum stress to the maximum stress) for constant amplitude loading. Tests must be performed to determine these fatigue crack propagation rates and associated material constants for each distinct material. Accordingly, a series of tests was conducted to measure fatigue crack growth rates in niobium. This material is one of the body-centered cubic refractory metals and its properties make it increasingly useful as a structural material in nuclear applications (because of its low thermal neutron cross-section and corrosion resistance) and energy conversion devices (see papers in Reference 1 for range of applications). Axial load fatigue crack growth tests were conducted with pure niobium sheets. The data were analyzed using the elastic stress intensity method, and the material constants in the power law were determined. MATERIALS AND METHODS Fatigue crack growth tests were conducted on ten specimens of commercially pure niobium (in the as received condition) sheet specimens 2 inches (51 mm) wide, 8 inches (204 mm) long and with a nominal thickness of 0. 050 inch (1. 27 mm). Each specimen had a crack starter notch 0. 10 in (2. 54 mm) long by 0. 01 in (0. 25 mm) wide cut into the center. A reference grid with lines spaced 0. 050 in (1. 27 mm) apart was photographically printed on the surface of each specimen to measure crack growth. The longitudinal axis of the specimen was parallel to the rolling direction of the sheets.

A linear and a weakly nonlinear analysis are successively presented. The viscoelastic medium is modelled {{by means of a}} general rheological model including the lower convected, the upper convected, and the co-rotational Jeffreys models as particular cases. in comparison with previous analyses, two new dimensionless numbers are introduced, namely the so-called gravitational and rate of <b>heating</b> <b>numbers</b> instead of the classical Rayleigh and Marangoni numbers. The critical values for the temperature gradient, wave number and oscillation frequencies corresponding to the onset of convection are determined from a linear approach. After motion has set in, particular patterns are predicted taking the form of either rolls, or hexagon, or squares. By means of a nonlinear technique, restricted to steady situations, it is determined under which specific conditions one pattern is preferred. The influence of the constitutive equation, the Prandtl and the Blot numbers is examined and discussed in details. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science B. V. All rights reserved...|$|R
