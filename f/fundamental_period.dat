We show {{that if a}} motive M is constructed from motives M 1, M 2, [...] ., Mn by a standard algebraic operation, then the <b>fundamental</b> <b>periods</b> of M can be expressed as monomials of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>periods</b> of M 1, M 2, [...] ., Mn.

The {{purpose of this paper}} is to show that a motive M over Q has finitely many period invariants by which we can describe the change of period invariants for algebraic operations on motives. We will show the efficacy of our results by taking the (hypothetical) motives attached to a Siegel modular form. To be precise, let M be a motive over Q with coefficients in an algebrai...|$|R

50|$|RV Tau was {{discovered}} to be variable in 1905 by Lydia Ceraski, and by 1907 {{it was clear}} that it had minima of alternating brightness. Over a period of 78.5 days it shows two maxima at around magnitude 9.5, a minimum around magnitude 10.0, and another minimum about 0.5 magnitudes fainter. This change in brightness is caused by pulsations: the temperature and radius vary, causing some variation in luminosity but mostly a shift of the emitted radiation from visual to infrared. The spectral type varies in line with the temperature, being classified as G2 at its brightest and M2 at its dimmest. In addition to the <b>fundamental</b> <b>period</b> given, RV Tauri also exhibits small variations in its mean brightness over a period of 1,216 days. The maxima and minima in each period vary by several tenths of a magnitude with no obvious regularity.|$|E

40|$|This study explores a coefficient-based seismic {{capacity}} {{assessment method}} {{with a special}} emphasis on low-rise masonry in-filled (MI) reinforced concrete (RC) buildings subjected to earthquake motion. The coefficient-based method without requiring any complicated finite element analysis is a simplified procedure to assess the maximum spectral acceleration capacity of buildings. This paper first compares the <b>fundamental</b> <b>periods</b> of MI RC structures obtained, respectively, from experimental period data and empirical period-height formulas. The coefficient-based method for low-rise masonry buildings is then calibrated by the published experimental results obtained from shaking table tests. The comparison of the experimental and estimated results indicates that the simplified coefficient-based method can provide good approximations of the maximum spectral accelerations at peak loads of the low-rise masonry reinforced concrete buildings if a proper set of drift factors and initial <b>fundamental</b> vibration <b>periods</b> of structures are used. link_to_subscribed_fulltex...|$|R

There were distinct gaps in the belt at locations that corresponded to resonances with Jupiter.

5000|$|Beta Cephei {{variables}} are main-sequence stars of masses between about 7 and 20 M (that is, 7-20 times as massive as the sun). Among their number {{are some of}} the brightest stars in the sky, such as Beta Crucis and Beta Centauri; Spica is also classified as a Beta Cephei variable but mysteriously stopped pulsating in 1970. Typically, they change in brightness by 0.01 to 0.3 magnitudes with periods of 0.1 to 0.3 days (2.4-7.2 hours). The prototype of these variable stars, Beta Cephei, shows variation in apparent magnitude from +3.16 to +3.27 with a period of 4.57 hours. The point of maximum brightness occurs when the star is smallest and hottest. Their variation in brightness is much greater—up to 1 magnitude—in ultraviolet wavelengths. [...] A small number of stars have been identified with periods shorter than one hour, corresponding to 1/4 of the fundamental radial pulsation period and 3/8 of the <b>fundamental</b> <b>period.</b> They also have relatively low amplitudes and a very narrow range of spectral types B2-3 IV-V.

The variables which are pulsating simultaneously in two radial modes are shown to break cleanly into two period-ratio groups, providing the first unambiguous evidence that the second overtone is indeed excited in real Cepheids. Thirty stars are beating in the fundamental and first overtone mode (F/ 1 H, with a period ratio {{in the neighborhood of}} 0. 72), and fifteen stars are beating in the first and second overtone (1 H/ 2 H, with a period ratio near 0. 80). The F/ 1 H period ratios are systematically higher than known Galactic beat Cepheids, indicating a metallicity dependence whose sense is in agreement with theory. Beat Cepheids in the LMC are found to select the 1 H/ 2 H mode for <b>fundamental</b> <b>periods</b> shorter than 1. 25 days. We find the fraction of Cepheids excited in two modes to be about 20 % for stars with <b>fundamental</b> <b>periods</b> shorter than 2. 5 days.
