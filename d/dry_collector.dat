The relative efficiency of four types of eolian {{dust collectors}} was investigated by examining dust deposition efficiency in an eolian dust tunnel, and measuring long-term accumulation efficiency during a 24 -month field experiment in a desert environment. The deposition and accumulation surfaces of the collectors tested, were: (1) a dry and flat surface, (2) a flat but moist surface, (3) a surface composed of two superimposed layers of marbles, and (4) a free water surface. The water collector showed the highest efficiency, both for deposition and accumulation. Deposition efficiency of the marble collector was {{comparable to that of}} the water collector, but the former was more sensitive to post-depositional erosion. The effect of post-depositional erosion was most evident in the dry and the moist collectors tested.

40|$|The aim of {{this study}} is to {{evaluate}} the relationship between solar dryer geometry and the drying rate of seeds; hence the analysis of the effects of a flat plate solar dryer geometry on drying rate of Agricultural seeds is presented using a case study of Ogbono seeds (Irvingea gabonensis). Ogbono seeds were dried using a distributed type, forced convention solar drying system, consisting of a solar collector plate of a geometric area (A), thickness (D) and tilt angle (β). The drying rates of the Ogbono seeds were obtained for collector plate Areas of 0. 24, 0. 42 and 0. 60 m 2; tilt angles of 0, 5, 10 and 15 º; absorber plate thicknesses of 1. 50, 2. 70 and 4. 20 mm. The graphs of Area (A) of <b>collector</b> plate against <b>drying</b> rate showed that the drying rates increased linearly with the increase in the area of collector plate. From the graphs of angles of tilt against drying rate, it was evident that the drying rate generally increased curvlinearly to a point with the increase in the tilt angle. From that point of inflection, the drying rate decreased with the increase in the tilt angle of the plate. A maximum drying rate of 10. 03 % m. c/h was obtained for the Ogbono seeds during the field test. This maximum rate of <b>drying</b> occurred for <b>collector</b> plate area of 0. 60 m 2, tilt angle of 5 o and plate thickness of 2. 70 mm. The corresponding collector efficiency is 57 %...|$|R
40|$|In this study, mercury (Hg) was sampled weekly in dry and wet {{deposition}} and throughfall and monthly in litterfall, {{and as it}} was volatilized from soil from August  2008 to February 2010 to identify the factors influencing the amount of atmospheric Hg deposited to forested areas in a temperate deciduous forest in South Korea. For this location {{there was no significant}} correlation between the estimated monthly dry deposition flux (litterfall + throughfall – {{wet deposition}}) (6. 7  µg m − 2  yr − 1) and directly measured dry deposition (9. 9  µg m − 2  yr − 1) likely due primarily to Hg losses from the litterfall <b>collector.</b> <b>Dry</b> deposition fluxes in cold seasons (fall and winter) were lower than in warmer seasons (spring and summer). The volume-weighted mean (VWM) Hg concentrations in both precipitation and throughfall were highest in winter, likely due to increased scavenging by snow events. Since South Korea experiences abundant rainfall in summer, VWM Hg concentrations in summer were lower than in other seasons. Litterfall fluxes were highest in the late fall to early winter, when leaves were dropped from the trees (September to November). The cumulative annual Hg emission flux from soil was 6. 8  µg m − 2  yr − 1. Based on these data, the yearly deposition fluxes of Hg calculated using two input approaches (wet deposition + dry deposition or throughfall + litterfall) were 6. 8 and 3. 6  µg m − 2  yr − 1, respectively. This is the first reported study which measured the amount of atmospheric Hg deposited to forested areas in South Korea, and thus our results provide useful information to compare against data related to Hg fate and transport {{in this part of the}} world...|$|R
