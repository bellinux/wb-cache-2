5|$|Justine Ezarik, then a 23-year-old Pittsburgh-area graphic {{designer}} and sketch comedian, who video blogged {{under the name}} iJustine, received her 300-page bill on Saturday, August 11, 2007 and decided {{to use it as}} a prop for a self-produced video shot <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop. She posted the edited one-minute clip to several popular Internet video hosting services by the following Monday. In the first week, the video received over 500,000 total views on YouTube, 350,000 views on Revver, 500,000 views on Break.com and 1,100,000 views on Yahoo Video, as self-reported by the four popular Internet video sites as of August 22. Total views were reported to exceed 8 million by the end of 2007. Ezarik said she earned $2,000 from the video from Revver.|$|E
5|$|The scenes at {{the marina}} where Dexter keeps his boat, Coral Cove, were filmed at the Leeward Bay Marina in Los Angeles' Wilmington neighborhood, {{in spite of}} the show's Miami setting. The episode opens <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> bar at Coral Cove Marina, which was filmed at Leeward Bay's {{floating}} diner, the Chowder Barge. One of the empty barns at Long Beach, California's Shoreline Village was set up as the comic book store. Doakes and LaGuerta discuss the homicide case while standing on the Shoreline Village boardwalk, and the Village car park was used to film Doakes and LaGuerta's stake out.|$|E
5|$|The song's music video, {{directed}} by Nick Brandt, and shot in Los Angeles, is focused around six unrelated {{people living in}} isolation in a cityscape on a dark, cloudy day {{while the rest of}} the world moves around them in slow motion. The first half of the video introduces these figures. Five of the figures are: a bald man looking down at the city from his apartment window, a middle-aged woman sitting alone <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop, a homeless man lying on the damp street, a well-dressed figure feeding pigeons, and a teenage boy ostracized from a game of baseball. The sixth figure is Jackson himself, seen walking the city streets while he sings. Special effects are used to show birds and wasps flying, glass breaking and coffee spilling, all in slow motion.|$|E

5|$|The video's main {{theme is}} a romantic fantasy narrative. It {{begins with a}} montage of pencil {{drawings}} in a comic-book style representing motorcycle sidecar racing, in which the hero, played by Morten Harket, is pursued by two opponents, {{one of whom is}} played by English actor Philip Jackson. It then cuts to a scene in a cafe, in which a young woman, played by Bunty Bailey (Harket's girlfriend at the time), is seen drinking coffee and reading the comic book <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop. As the woman reads, the waitress brings her the bill. The comic's hero, after winning the race, seemingly winks at the woman from the page. His pencil-drawn hand reaches out of the comic book, inviting the woman into it. Once inside, she too appears in the pencil-drawn form, as he sings to her and introduces her to his black-and-white world which features a sort of looking-glass portal where people and objects look real on one side and pencil-drawn on the other.|$|E

25|$|In 2007, Wisdom {{returned}} to {{acting in a}} short film directed by Kevin Powis, Expresso. The film, which Wisdom later announced (reported BBC/ITV News) was to be officially his last film role, is set during one day <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop and {{was funded by the}} UK Film Council and ScreenWM. Shot in January, it premièred at the Cannes Film Festival on 27 May 2007. It was later adopted by the UK charity Macmillan and released on DVD in aid of the charity. In the film Wisdom plays a vicar plagued by a fly in a café. Producer Nigel Martin Davey gave him only a visual role so that he would not have to remember any lines, but on the day Wisdom was alert and had his performance changed to add more laughs.|$|E
25|$|The 2-mm-long coffee borer beetle (Hypothenemus hampei) is {{the most}} {{damaging}} insect pest to the world's coffee industry, destroying up to 50 {{percent or more of}} the coffee berries on plantations in most coffee-producing countries. The adult female beetle nibbles a single tiny hole <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> berry and lays 35 to 50 eggs. Inside, the offspring grow, mate, and then emerge from the commercially ruined berry to disperse, repeating the cycle. Pesticides are mostly ineffective because the beetle juveniles are protected inside the berry nurseries, but they are vulnerable to predation by birds when they emerge. When groves of trees are nearby, the American yellow warbler, rufous-capped warbler, and other insectivorous birds have been shown to reduce by 50 percent the number of coffee berry borers in Costa Rica coffee plantations.|$|E
25|$|On May 18, 1977, , who {{belonged to}} small group of confidants, a housemate of Öcalan, not a Kurd but a Turk from Ordu, was {{dispatched}} to Gaziantep to recruit new members. He {{was involved in a}} political discussion with another left Kurdish faction called “Sterka Sor” (Red Star) <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop. He was killed in Gaziantep, allegedly by members of a rival Kurdish group. This was the first resistance against APOcular by a rival Kurdish group. From that moment APOcular become more careful, strict and violent. In the party’s historiography, the death of Haki Karer is related to the decision to deepen and strengthen the struggle. Haki Karer's brother Baki Karer (co-founder) who was working for government later claimed his brother had been killed after a disagreement with Öcalan.|$|E

25|$|During {{the late}} 1980s, Lynch {{had begun to}} work in {{television}} as well as cinema, directing a short piece titled The Cowboy and the Frenchman for French television in 1989. Around this time, he met the television producer Mark Frost, who had formerly worked on such projects as the television police series Hill Street Blues, {{and they decided to}} start working together on a biopic of singer and actress Marilyn Monroe based upon Anthony Summers's book, The Goddess: The Secret Lives of Marilyn Monroe. While this project never got off the ground, the duo went on to work on a comedy script named One Saliva Bubble, but that did not see completion either. While they were talking <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop, Lynch and Frost had the idea of a corpse washing up on the shore of a lake, and subsequently set about on their third project, initially called Northwest Passage but would eventually become the television series Twin Peaks (1990–1991).|$|E

500|$|Ruth met Helen Woodford (1897–1929), by some accounts, <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop in Boston {{where she}} was a waitress, and they were married as {{teenagers}} on October 17, 1914. Although Ruth later {{claimed to have been}} married in Elkton, Maryland, records show that they were married at St. Paul's Catholic Church in Ellicott City. They adopted a daughter, Dorothy (1921–1989), in 1921. Ruth and Helen separated around 1925, reportedly due to his repeated infidelities. They appeared in public as a couple for the last time during the 1926 World Series. Helen died in January 1929 at age 31 in a house fire in Watertown, Massachusetts, in a house owned by Edward Kinder, a dentist with whom she had been living as [...] "Mrs. Kinder". In her book, My Dad, the Babe, Dorothy claimed that she was Ruth's biological child by a mistress named Juanita Jennings. She died in 1989.|$|E
500|$|Eastwood {{directed}} {{and starred in}} the fourth Dirty Harry film, Sudden Impact, which {{was shot in the}} spring and summer of 1983 and is considered the darkest and most violent of the series. By this time Eastwood received 60percent of all profits from films he starred in and directed, with the rest going to the studio. Sudden Impact was his final on-screen collaboration with Locke. She plays an artist who, along with her sister, was gang-raped a decade before the story takes place and seeks revenge for her sister's now-vegetative state by systematically murdering the rapists. The line [...] "Go ahead, make my day" [...] (uttered by Eastwood during an early scene <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop) has been cited as one of cinema's immortal lines. It was quoted by President Ronald Reagan in a speech to Congress, and used during the 1984 presidential elections. The film was the second most commercially successful of the Dirty Harry films, after The Enforcer, earning $70million. It received very positive reviews, with many critics praising the feminist aspects of the film through its explorations of the physical and psychological consequences of rape.|$|E
500|$|The {{debate has}} {{inspired}} {{at least two}} satirical Internet urban legends.

[...] This article was copied into a chain letter and circulated among Christians as [...] "proof" [...] of their views. The following year the Canadian daily the National Post released a similar spoof article in its satirical column Post Morten, saying that [...] "Rowling—or, as she shall henceforth be referred to and credited as, Mrs. J. K. Satan—said that as she sat <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop one grey day, {{wondering what to do}} with her empty, aimless life, it hit her, 'I'll give myself, body and soul, to the Dark Master. And in return, he will give me absurd wealth and power over the weak and pitiful of the world. And he did!'"

500|$|Pasadena Police Department criminologist Don Harding led the {{official}} investigation; {{he concluded that}} Parsons had been mixing fulminate of mercury <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> can when he dropped it on the floor, causing the initial explosion, which worsened when it {{came into contact with}} other chemicals in the room. Forman considered this likely, stating that Parsons often had sweaty hands and could easily have dropped the can. Some of Parsons' colleagues rejected this explanation, saying that he was very attentive about safety. Two colleagues from the Bermite Powder Company described Parsons' work habits as [...] "scrupulously neat" [...] and [...] "exceptionally cautious". The latter statement—from chemical engineer George Santymers—insisted that the explosion must have come from beneath the floorboards, implying an organized plot to kill Parsons. Harding accepted that these inconsistencies were [...] "incongruous" [...] but described the manner in which Parsons had stored his chemicals as [...] "criminally negligent", and noted that Parsons had previously been investigated by the police for illegally storing chemicals at the Parsonage. He also found a morphine-filled syringe at the scene, suggesting that Parsons was narcotized. The police saw insufficient evidence to continue the investigation and closed the case as an accidental death.|$|E
500|$|Cox was 30 {{years old}} at the time she was cast, making her the show's second oldest main cast member, and was 39 by the {{beginning}} of Friends final season. Additionally, this distinction makes Cox older than her on-screen brother, actor David Schwimmer, who portrays her older brother Ross, who is one year her senior. The actress would deliver Monica's lines emphatically. Although each character is depicted as an avid coffee drinker, spending much of their free time <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> house, Cox herself does not drink coffee, and was only pretending to drink it out of mugs on the show. Kauffman believes that Cox's own cleanliness closely resembles her character's; at times the actress would clean her co-stars' dressing rooms. Cox also shares the character's motherly nature. The actress enjoyed portraying Monica she was able to [...] "bring more of my own personality to her, and I've never really been able to do that before." [...] Starpulse.com observed that [...] "As Monica, Cox never quite enjoyed the sort of watercooler storylines that co-star ... Jennifer Aniston had with David Schwimmer as the on-again, off-again Rachel and Ross." [...] At one point, Cox had begun to regret her decision to accept the role of Monica over Rachel due to the character's lack of strong storylines; she eventually relented once Monica and Chandler became romantically involved, thus her character's storylines gradually began to improve.|$|E
500|$|A later scene depicts Walter in a {{hospital}} recovering from a gunshot wound. Olivia and William Bell try to smuggle him out. As {{it was a real}} emergency room in a Vancouver hospital, the crew had only one day of shooting.

The scene between Olivia, Walter, and Bell was originally set <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>coffee</b> shop, but the producers changed their minds when they realized they needed more funding for the finale. Consequently, they began [...] "hawking" [...] the scene in the hopes of gaining a sponsor. KFC responded, agreeing to pay them for shooting the scene at one of their locations. Walternate's office scenes were shot in a mortuary overlooking a cemetery. Goldsman had Joshua Jackson react in different ways during his first meeting with Fauxlivia, including showing [...] "anger and testiness". He ultimately decided he would be [...] "quite taken with her". For the second episode's cliffhanger, the producers worried about making it as [...] "provocative" [...] as the first season's. They were originally going to have Olivia sacrifice herself to allow Peter and Walter's return to Our Side, but changed their minds when Wyman suggested she be secretly swapped with Fauxlivia instead. Wyman commented, [...] "We were ecstatic when we figured [...] out." [...] Co-creator J.J. Abrams and other cast members were also pleased with it, with Abrams calling it [...] "different, but I think equally impactful."
