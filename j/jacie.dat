6000|$|Another very {{entertaining}} fellow {{for those}} who are willing to work through a pretty thick husk of tiresomeness for a genuine kernel of humor underneath is Coddington. The elder Winthrop endured many trials, but I doubt if any were sharper than those which his son had to undergo in the correspondence of this excellently tiresome man. Tantae molis Romanam condere gentem! The dulness of Coddington, always that of no ordinary man, became irritable and aggressive after being stung by the gadfly of Quakerism. Running counter to its proper nature, it made him morbidly uneasy. Already an Anabaptist, his brain {{does not seem to have}} been large enough to lodge two maggots at once with any comfort to himself. Fancy John Winthrop, Jr., with all the affairs of the Connecticut Colony on his back, expected to prescribe alike for the spiritual and bodily ailments of all the hypochondriacs in his government, and with Philip's war impending,--fancy him exposed also to perpetual trials like this: [...] "G.F. [George Fox] hath sent thee a book of his by Jere: Bull, & two more now which thou mayest communicate to thy Council & officers. Also I remember before thy last being in England, I sent thee a book written by Francis Howgall against persecution, by Joseph Nicallson which book thou lovingly accepted and communicated to the Commissioners of the United Colonies (as I desired) also J.N. thou entertained with a loving respect which encouraged me" [...] (fatal hospitality!)--"As a token of that ancient love that for this 42 years I have had for thee, I have sent thee three Manuscripts, one of 5 queries, other is of 15, about the love of Jesus &c. The 3d is why we cannot come to the worship which was not set up by Christ Jesus, which I desire thee to communicate to the priests to answer in thy jurisdiction, the Massachusetts, New Plymouth, or elsewhere, & send their answer in writing to me. Also two printed papers to set up in thy house. It's reported in Barbadoes that thy brother Sammuell shall be sent Governour to Antego." [...] What a mere dust of sugar in the last sentence for such a portentous pill! In his next letter he has other writings of G. F., [...] "not yet copied, which if thou desireth, when I hear from thee, I may convey them unto thee. Also sence G. Ffox departure William Edmondson is arrived at this Island, who having given out a paper to all in authority, which, my wife having copied, I have here inclosed presented thee therewith." [...] Books and manuscripts were not all. Coddington was also glad to bestow on Winthrop any wandering tediousness in the flesh that came to hand. [...] "I now understand of John Stubbs freedom to visit thee (with the said Jo: B.) he is a larned man, as witness the battle door[145] on 35 languages,"--a terrible man this, capable of inflicting himself on three dozen different kindreds of men. It will be observed that Coddington, with his [...] "thou desireths," [...] is not quite so well up in the grammar of his thee-and-thouing as my Lord Coke. Indeed, it is rather pleasant to see that in his alarm about [...] "the enemy," [...] in 1673, he backslides into the second person plural. If Winthrop ever looked over his father's correspondence, he would have read in a letter of Henry <b>Jacie</b> the following dreadful example of retribution: [...] "The last news we heard was that the Bores in Bavaria slew about 300 of the Swedish forces & took about 200 prisoners, of which they put out the eyes of some & cut out the tonges of others & so sent them to the King of Sweden, which caused him to lament bytterly for an hour. Then he sent an army & destroyed those Bores, about 200 or 300 of their towns. Thus we hear." [...] Think of that, Master Coddington! Could the sinful heart of man always suppress the wish that a Gustavus might arise to do judgment on the Bores of Rhode Island? The unkindest part of it was that, on Coddington's own statement, Winthrop had never persecuted the Quakers, and had even endeavored to save Robinson and Stevenson in 1659.|$|E

40|$|The Joint Agency Commercial Imagery Evaluation (<b>JACIE)</b> team is a {{collaborative}} interagency group {{focused on the}} characterization of commercial remote sensing data products. The team members - the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA), the National Imagery and Mapping Agency (NIMA), and the U. S. Geological Survey (USGS) - each {{have a vested interest}} in the purchase and use of commercial imagery to support government research and operational applications. For both research and applications, commercial products must be well characterized for precision, accuracy, and repeatability. Since commercial systems are built and operated with no government insight or oversight, the <b>JACIE</b> team provides an independent product characterization of delivered image and image-derived end products. End product characterization differs from the systems calibration approach that is typically used with government systems, where detailed system design information is available. The product characterization approach addresses three primary areas of product performance: geopositional accuracy, image quality, and radiometric accuracy. The <b>JACIE</b> team utilizes well-characterized test sites to support characterization activities. To characterize geopositional accuracy, the team utilizes sites containing several "photo-identifiable" targets and compares their precisely known locations with those defined by the commercial image product. In the area of image quality, spatial response is characterized using edge targets and pulse targets to measure edge response and to estimate image modulation transfer function. Additionally, imagery is also characterized using the National Imagery Interpretability Rating Scale, a means of quantifying the ability to identify certain targets (e. g., rail-cars, airplanes) within an image product. Radiometric accuracy is characterized using reflectance-based vicarious calibration methods at several uniform sites. Each <b>JACIE</b> agency performs an aspect of product characterization based on its area of expertise, thus minimizing duplication of effort. The <b>JACIE</b> team collaborated to perform comprehensive characterization of products from Space Imaging Inc. 's IKONOS satellite and from DigitalGlobe's QuickBird satellite and is currently characterizing products from OrbImage s OrbView- 3. <b>JACIE</b> assessments have resulted in several improvements to commercial image product quality and have enhanced working relationships between government and industry.

40|$|International audienceMore than 145 European hematopoietic SCT {{programs}} have received <b>JACIE</b> (Joint Accreditation Committee for ISCT Europe and EBMT) accreditation since 2000, demonstrating compliance with FACT (Foundation for the Accreditation of Cell Therapy) -JACIE international standards. The association of <b>JACIE</b> with improved patient outcome was recently documented. However, {{conditions in which}} quality management systems were introduced and the actual benefits remain to be fully evaluated. Our study focuses on one aspect of quality management: introduction and use of indicators. Through a questionnaire sent to JACIE-accredited centers and responses from 32 programs (or 40 %), we identified 293 indicators, including 224 (76 %) that were introduced during the preparatory phase of <b>JACIE</b> accreditation.

Mapping revealed an uneven distribution of indicators across the different subprocesses that contribute to this highly specialized medical procedure. Moreover, we found that only 101 / 293 indicators (34 %) complied with the rules for implementation of a quality indicator, as defined by the FDX 50 - 171 standard.

40|$|Purpose A {{comprehensive}} {{quality management system}} called <b>JACIE</b> (Joint Accreditation Committee International Society for Cellular Therapy and the European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation), was introduced to improve quality of care in hematopoietic stem-cell transplantation (HSCT). We therefore tested {{the hypothesis that the}} introduction of <b>JACIE</b> improved patient survival. Patients and Methods Data on 41, 623 allogeneic (39 %) and 66, 281 autologous (61 %) HSCTs for an acquired hematologic disorder performed between 1999 and 2007 by 421 teams in Europe were used to assess the outcomes of patients who received a transplantation at baseline (> 3 years before application or no application), during preparation (3 years before application), during application (time from application to accreditation), and after <b>JACIE</b> accreditation. The analysis was clustered by team and stratified for year of HSCT, donor type, disease, conditioning, and gross national income per capita of the respective country. Patient's risks were adjusted for by their European Group for Blood and Marrow Transplantation score. Results Patient outcome was systematically better when the transplantation center was at a more advanced phase of <b>JACIE</b> accreditation, independent of year of transplantation and other risk factors. Improvement was robust as quantified for relapse-free survival after allogeneic HSCT compared with baseline by a hazard ratio (HR) of 0. 96 (95 % CI, 0. 90 to 1. 03; P =. 22) for preparation, 0. 95 (95 % CI, 0. 88 to 1. 03; P =. 20) for application, and 0. 86 (95 % CI, 0. 78 to 0. 95; P =. 01) for the accreditation (test for trend P =. 01). Improvement from baseline was similar after autologous HSCT (HR for accreditation, 0. 83; 95 % CI, 0. 74 to 0. 93; P <. 01).

40|$|Background: Autologous, and in {{some cases}} allogeneic, {{hemopoietic}} stem cells (HSC) are stored for varying periods of time prior to infusion. For periods of greater than 48 h, storage requires cryopreservation. It is essential to optimize cell storage and ensure the quality of the product for subsequent reinfusion. Methods: A number of important variables may affect the subsequent quality of infused HSC and therapeutic cells (TC). This review discusses these and also reviews the regulatory framework that now aims to ensure the quality of stem cells and TC for transplantation. Results: Important variables included cell concentration, temperature, interval from collection to cryopreservation, manipulations performed. They also included rate of freezing and whether controlled-rate freezing was employed. Parameters studied were type of cryoprotectant utilized [dimethyl sulphoxide (DMSO) is most commonly used, sometimes in combination with hydroxyethyl starch (HES) ]; and storage conditions. It is also important to assess the quality of stored stem cells. Measurements employed included the total cell count (TNC), mononuclear cell count (MNC), CD 34 &#x 002 B; cells and colony-forming units - granulocyte macrophage (CFU-GM). Of these, TNC and CD 34 &#x 002 B; are the most useful. However, the best measure of the quality of stored stem cells is their subsequent engraftment. The quality systems used in stem cell laboratories are described in the guidance of the Joint Accreditation Committee of ISCT (Europe) and the EBMT (<b>JACIE)</b> and the EU Directive on Tissues and Cells plus its supporting commission directives. Inspections of facilities are carried out by the appropriate national agencies and <b>JACIE.</b> Conclusion: For high-quality storage of HSC and TC, processing facilities should use validated procedures that take into account critical variables.
