5|$|Dragon kiln: Dragon kilns were {{traditional}} Chinese kilns {{used for}} Chinese ceramics. According to recent excavations in Shangyu District {{in the northeast}} of Zhejiang province and elsewhere, {{the origins of the}} dragon kiln may go back as far as the Shang dynasty (c. 1600 to 1046 BCE), and is linked to the introduction of stoneware, fired at 1200°C or more. These kilns were much smaller than later examples, at some 5–12 metres long, and also sloped far less. The type had certainly developed by the Warring States period, and by the Eastern Wu kingdom (220–280 CE), there were over 60 kilns at Shangyu. Thereafter it remained the main design used in southern China until the Ming dynasty. The pottery areas of south China are mostly hilly, whereas those on the plains of north China typically lack suitable slopes; here the mantou <b>kiln</b> <b>type</b> predominated. The Nanfeng Kiln in Guangdong province is several centuries old and still functioning. It was a producer of Shiwan ware as well as architectural ceramics, and today also functions as a tourist attraction.|$|E

Due {{to the difficulty}} in recovering the waste vinyl and contamination of soil, recycling of the waste vinyl has been disadvantageous to reutilization. According to Korea Resources & Reutilization Corporation, 327, 000 tons of waste vinyl from a farm village was discarded in 2001, which poses urgent problem to our environment and preservation of natural resources. In this study, as a program of reutilization in waste vinyl, it is investigated the possibility of reuse in cement kiln process as an assist fuel through the characterization of waste vinyl material properties and the mass balance measurement of the various <b>kiln</b> <b>types.</b> Calorific values and Chlorine content of the waste vinyl were 10, 000 / and below 500 ppm, respectively.

The concept design was based on air staging and process separation. This concept was demonstrated on a pilot scale rotary kiln reactor under ambient pressure and autothermic conditions. The pilot scale gasifier was divided into three different reaction regions, which were oxidative degradation, partial oxidation and char gasification. A series of tests was conducted to investigate the effect of key parameters. The results indicate that under optimum operating conditions, a fuel gas with high heat value of about 5500 kJ/Nm 3 and gas production rate of 2. 32 Nm 3 /kg could be produced. Tar concentration in the fuel gas could be reduced to 108 mg/Nm 3 (at the gasifier outlet) and 38 mg/Nm 3 (after gas conditioning). The cold gas efficiency and carbon conversion rate reached 75 % and 78 %, respectively.

These efficiency improvements result from a number of policies which are transforming the entire cement industry towards international best practice including shutting down many older plants and raising the efficiency standards of cement plants. Still, the efficiency gains cannot compensate for the huge increase in cement production resulting from economic growth particularly in the infrastructure and construction sectors.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: Little {{information}} {{is available on the}} quantitative risks of respiratory disease from quartz in airborne dust in the heavy clay industry. Available evidence suggested that these risks might be low, possibly because of the presence in the dust of other minerals, such as illite and kaolinite, which may reduce the harmful effects of quartz. The aims of the present cross sectional study were to determine among workers in the industry (a) their current and cumulative exposures to respirable mixed dust and quartz; (b) the frequencies of chest radiographic abnormalities and respiratory symptoms; (c) the relations between cumulative exposure to respirable dust and quartz, and risks of radiographic abnormality and respiratory symptoms. METHODS: Factories were chosen where the type of process had changed as little as possible during recent decades. 18 were selected in England and Scotland, ranging in size from 35 to 582 employees, representing all the main types of raw material, end product, kilns, and processes in the manufacture of bricks, pipes, and tiles but excluding refractory products. Weights of respirable dust and quartz in more than 1400 personal dust samples, and site histories, were used to derive occupational groups characterised by their levels of exposure to dust and quartz. Full size chest radiographs, respiratory symptoms, smoking, and occupational history questionnaires were administered to current workers at each factory. Exposure-response relations were examined for radiographic abnormalities (dust and quartz) and respiratory symptoms (dust only). RESULTS: Respirable dust and quartz concentrations ranged from means of 0. 4 and 0. 04 mg. m- 3 for non-process workers to 10. 0 and 0. 62 mg. m- 3 for kiln demolition workers respectively. Although 97 % of all quartz concentrations were below the maximum exposure limit of 0. 4 mg. m- 3, 10 % were greater than this among the groups of workers exposed to most dust. Cumulative exposure calculations for dust and quartz took account of changes of occupational group, factory, and <b>kiln</b> <b>type</b> at study and non-study sites. Because of the importance of changes of <b>kiln</b> <b>type</b> additional weighting factors were applied to concentrations of dust and quartz during previous employment at factories that used certain types of kiln. 85 % (1934 employees) of the identified workforce attended the medical surveys. The frequency of small opacities in the chest radiograph, category > or = 1 / 0, was 1. 4 % (median reading) and seven of these 25 men had category > or = 2 / 1. Chronic bronchitis was reported by 14. 2 % of the workforce and breathlessness, when walking with someone of their own age, by 4. 4 %. Risks of having category > or = 0 / 1 small opacities differed by site and were also influenced by age, smoking, and lifetime cumulative exposure to respirable dust and quartz. Although exposures to dust and to quartz were highly correlated, the evidence suggested that radiological abnormality was associated with quartz rather than dust. A doubling of cumulative quartz exposure increased the risk of having category > or = 0 / 1 by a factor of 1. 33. Both chronic bronchitis and breathlessness were significantly related to dust exposure. CONCLUSIONS: Although most quartz concentrations {{at the time of this}} study were currently below regulatory limits in the heavy clay industry, high exposures regularly occurred in specific processes and occasionally among most occupational groups. However, there are small risks of pneumoconiosis and respiratory symptoms in the industry, although frequency of pneumoconiosis is low in comparison to other quartz exposed workers...|$|E

For on-site continuous processing, heating mode and material carrier are two important technical links of the thermal desorption unit (TDU).

The fuel for indirect fired is diesel or the recovered oil from oily cuttings, while the environmental regulatory agency might think that secondary pollution would be caused by combustion. The temperature carrying of the heat transfer fluid is limited, and the industrial heat transfer oil maximum operating temperature is usually around 350  °C. This temperature is only marginally hot to remove oil from raw materials to an acceptable limit. The thermomechanical cuttings cleaner (TCC) is another type of thermal desorption system, which adopts frictional heating (Murray et al. 2008). The TCC has a hammer mill, which crushes cuttings and generates heat by friction {{during the process of}} hammering and crushing. The friction heat generated by the hammer mill can make the cuttings temperature up to 300  °C. The oil phase with high boiling point might be difficult to remove due to the limited friction heating temperature, and the adaptability of materials is limited. Microwave heating of thermal desorption is another method that attracts more attention by researchers (Robinson et al. 2008; Falciglia and Vagliasindi 2015; Júnior et al. 2017). Microwave heating is a direct heating method with highly efficient, and the material is heated evenly. The absorption of microwave energy by materials affects the efficiency of liquid phases desorption. The physical and chemical properties of the materials and the dielectric constant of pollutants have great influence on microwave energy absorption (Falciglia et al. Falciglia and Vagliasindi 2015; Petri et al. 2017). Therefore, microwave heating has great selectivity for material composition. It is especially effective for the heating of polar compounds.|$|E
40|$|In {{studies of}} Chinese {{ceramics}} of designated periods, {{it is generally}} assumed that the forms and decoration produced were universal, that is, they were made by most <b>kilns</b> in most <b>types</b> of wares. In fact, as this study of Northern Sung ceramics will dem-onstrate, there are distinct regional differences in forms and decoration with some types only produced at a single kiln site. This paper will consider some of these regional forms and decoration by examining the contexts for their production, {{and the impact of}} technology, consumers and markets...|$|R

Most {{hardwood}} lumber kilns are side-loader kilns in which fork trucks {{are used to}} load lumber packages into the kiln. Most softwood <b>kilns</b> are track <b>types</b> in which the timber (US. lumber) is loaded on kiln/track cars for loading the kiln. Modern high-temperature, high-air-velocity conventional kilns can typically dry 1 in green wood in 10 hours down to a moisture content of 18%. However, 1-inch-thick green Red Oak requires about 28 days to dry down to a moisture content of 8%.|$|R
5000|$|A {{continuous}} kiln, {{sometimes called}} a tunnel kiln, {{is a long}} structure in which only the central portion is directly heated. From the cool entrance, ware is slowly transported through the kiln, and its temperature is increased steadily as it approaches the central, hottest part of the kiln. From there, it continues through the kiln, and the surrounding temperature is reduced until it exits the kiln nearly at room temperature. A continuous kiln is energy-efficient, because heat given off during cooling is recycled to pre-heat the incoming ware. In some designs, the ware is left in one place, while the heating zone moves across it. <b>Kilns</b> in this <b>type</b> include: ...|$|R
