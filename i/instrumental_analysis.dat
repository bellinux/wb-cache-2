25|$|Since the {{molecule}} has a hydroxyl (-OH) group, it is frequently bound to other lipids including fatty acids; most analytical methods, therefore, utilise a strong alkali (KOH or NaOH) to saponify the ester linkages. Typical extraction solvents include 6% KOH in methanol. The free sterols and stanols (saturated sterols) are then {{separated from the}} polar lipids by partitioning into a less polar solvent (e.g. hexane). Prior to analysis, the hydroxyl group is frequently derivatised with BSTFA (bis-trimethyl silyl trifluoroacetamide) to replace the hydrogen with the less exchangeable trimethylsilyl (TMS) group. <b>Instrumental</b> <b>analysis</b> is frequently conducted on gas chromatograph (GC) with either a flame ionisation detector (FID) or mass spectrometer (MS).

40|$|Background: Besides {{clinical}} and radiological examination instrumental functional analyses are performed as diagnostic procedures for craniomandibular dysfunctions. Instrumental functional analyses cause substantial costs and shows a considerable variability between individual dentist practices. Objectives: On {{the basis of}} published scientific evidence {{the validity of the}} <b>instrumental</b> functional <b>analysis</b> for the diagnosis of craniomandibular dysfunctions compared to clinical diagnostic procedures; the difference of the various forms of the instrumental functional analysis; the existence of a dependency on additional other factors and the need for further research are determined in this report. In addition, the cost effectiveness of the <b>instrumental</b> functional <b>analysis</b> is analysed in a health-policy context, and social, legal and ethical aspects are considered. Methods: A literature search is performed in over 27 databases and by hand. Relevant companies and institutions are contacted concerning unpublished studies. The inclusion criteria for publications are (i) diagnostic studies with the indication “craniomandibular malfunction”, (ii) a comparison between {{clinical and}} <b>instrumental</b> functional <b>analysis,</b> (iii) publications since 1990, (iv) publications in English or German. The identified literature is evaluated by two scientists regarding the relevance of content and methodical quality. Results: The systematic database search resulted in 962 hits. 187 medical and economic complete publications are evaluated. Since the evaluated studies are not relevant enough to answer the medical or health economic questions no study is included. Discussion: The inconsistent terminology concerning craniomandibular dysfunctions and instrumental functional analyses results in a broad literature search in databases and an extensive search by hand. Since no relevant results concerning the validity of the <b>instrumental</b> functional <b>analysis</b> in comparison to the clinical functional analysis are found, it is impossible to make relevant statements concerning the underlying research questions. Conclusion: Studies comparing the <b>instrumental</b> functional <b>analysis</b> to the clinical functional analysis for the diagnosis of craniomandibular dysfunctions are missing. So far the <b>instrumental</b> functional <b>analysis</b> is not systematically and independently validated in comparison to the clinical functional analysis as the reference standard. It is uncertain, whether conducting an <b>instrumental</b> functional <b>analysis</b> with a clinical functional analysis for the diagnostics of craniomandibular dysfunctions is recommendable. Further research is strongly recommended...|$|R

40|$|This thesis {{investigates the}} {{validity}} and usefulness of physician’s preference-based <b>instrumental</b> variable <b>analysis</b> in clinical epidemiological studies. Chapter 2 describes a survey amongst general practitioners, showing substantial variation in prescribing preference and showing prescribing patterns which suggest the stochastic monotonicity assumption may be plausible for physician’s preference as an instrumental variable. Chapter 3 describes an application of physician’s preference-based <b>instrumental</b> variable <b>analysis</b> in a moderate-sized study, showing uninformatively wide confidence intervals which limit the usefulness of <b>instrumental</b> variable <b>analysis</b> in this setting. Chapter 4 focuses on the bias-variance trade-off of <b>instrumental</b> variable <b>analysis</b> in comparison to conventional analyses, using simulations and theoretical derivations. Chapter 5 compares instrumental variable and conventional estimates {{of the effect of}} third versus second generation oral contraceptives on occurrence of venous thromboembolism. The similarity of these estimates under different sets of assumptions suggests major confounding is unlikely. Chapter 6 contains a suggestion for an additional step for reporting of instrumental variable analyses. The focus shifts to Mendelian randomisation {{in the second part of}} the thesis. Chapter 7 reviews the methodological approaches used in Mendelian randomisation studies and the quality of reporting. Chapter 8 shows that collider-stratification bias may exist in Mendelian randomisation studies in elderly populations. Promotor: J. P. Vandenbroucke, Co-Promotores: S. le Cessie, O. M.

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the {{analysis}} of the baseline patient characteristics in the unmatched group showed more corticosteroid use in patients with more severe illness; however, the propensity score weighting successfully balanced the characteristics between the patient groups with and without corticosteroid use, including factors that have the potential to affect mortality or are known to affect mortality in patients with sepsis. The results of the propensity score-weighted analysis suggested that refractory septic shock patients who were prescribed corticosteroids were less likely to die than those who were not. Moreover, to overcome the bias of unmeasured confounding factors, we also performed an <b>instrumental</b> variable <b>analysis</b> and confirmed the robustness of our results. Although neither propensity score <b>analysis</b> nor <b>instrumental</b> variable <b>analysis</b> is perfect for a robust assessment, consistent results from <b>instrumental</b> variable <b>analysis</b> may serve as a useful confirmatory analysis for propensity score analyses. International prospective trials are needed to confirm the effect of low-dose corticosteroids on refractory septic shock; however, currently, such trials are not easy to implement, e.g., a very slow inclusion rate with the CORTICUS study [17]. Before such trials can be undertaken, it is therefore necessary to have well-analyzed retrospective studies that permit sound hypotheses to be generated. We regard the present study as part of this kind of initial effort to acquire basic data. The findings of this investigation will help advance our understanding of the pathophysiology of septic shock.|$|R
