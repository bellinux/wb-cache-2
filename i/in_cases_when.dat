5|$|The American style Castle Doctrine is {{also not}} applied however it is usually {{considered}} acceptable to defend from a violent home invasion with a firearm. In 2014, an amendment of laws concerning self-defense was proposed {{with the aim of}} giving greater leeway to defenders, especially <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>when</b> they would not normally meet the bar for legitimate self-defense under the current legislation, but face extraordinary circumstances, such as confusion {{as a consequence of the}} attack, or when facing home invasion.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{new ideas}} about the {{treatment}} of alcoholism, the lifetime suspension was downgraded to a 10-year suspension in 1952. DUI prosecutions remained difficult <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>when</b> drivers refused to take a Breathalyzer test, and so in 1966, the state authorized the suspension of a person's driver's license for refusing to submit a breath sample. In 1977, the BAC limit was reduced to 0.10%, but the law was modified to differentiate between {{the second and third}} offenses, with lesser penalties for first and second convictions. In 1983, the state established a per se rule wherein a person over the limit was considered drunk in all cases (that is, not merely a presumption). Nine years later, the 0.01% BAC limit for drivers under 21 was instituted, and in 2003, the 0.10% BAC limit was reduced to 0.08% to comply with federal highway funding requirements.|$|E

25|$|Interestingly, {{different}} from other alkali metals, the amount of Na intercalation is very small. Quantum-mechanical calculations show that this originate from a quite general phenomenon: among the alkali and alkaline earth metals, Na and Mg generally have the weakest chemical binding to a given substrate, compared with the other elements in {{the same group of}} the periodic table. The phenomenon arises from the competition between trends in the ionization energy and the ion–substrate coupling, down the columns of the periodic table. However, considerable Na intercalation into graphite can occur <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>when</b> the ion is wrapped in a solvent shell through the process of co-intercalation.|$|E
25|$|The {{scope of}} this rule has been {{considered}} <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>when</b> much of the prosecution case involves evidence by a witness who is absent from court. In Luca v Italy (2003), in the European Court of Human Rights, it was held that a conviction solely or decisively based upon evidence of witnesses which the accused has had no opportunity to examine breached Article 6 of the Convention (right to a fair trial). However in R v Arnold (2004), in the Court of Appeal, it was said this rule would permit of some exceptions, otherwise it would provide a licence to intimidate witnesses - though neither should it {{be treated as a}} licence for prosecutors to prevent testing of their case. Each application had to be weighed carefully.|$|E
25|$|Coordinated {{words are}} {{normally}} written separately (with a comma).

A hyphen is needed <b>in</b> <b>cases</b> <b>when</b> a phrase is only used with certain suffixes. Connections of words which are completely fused and thus take suffixes only at the end of the second element are written as one word (e.g. búbánat ‘sorrow and grief’, búbánatos ‘stricken with sorrow and grief’). However, there are phrases that only take suffixes at the end but their elements are still connected with a hyphen, as when words are contrasted (e.g. édes-bús ‘bittersweet’). Certain phrases can be suffixed either at the end of both elements or only at the end of the second element (e.g. hírnév ‘fame’: hírneve or híre-neve ‘his/her/its fame’).|$|E
