5|$|Depending {{on which}} {{character}} the player assumes control of, either Chris or Barry {{is separated from}} the rest of the team during the chase and <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the mansion. At this point, the team decides to split up to investigate. Over the course of the game, the player character finds several members of Bravo Team, including Kenneth J. Sullivan being eaten by a zombie; Richard Aiken, who is either killed by a giant venomous snake or eaten by a shark; Forest Speyer, who is found dead on the balcony and then revived as a zombie; and Bravo Team leader Enrico Marini, who reveals that one of Alpha Team's members is a traitor before being shot and killed by an unseen assailant. Bravo Team survivor Rebecca Chambers joins Chris. The player character eventually learns that a series of illegal experiments was being undertaken by a clandestine research team under the authority and supervision of biomedical company Umbrella Corporation. The creatures roaming the mansion and its surrounding areas are the results of these experiments, which have exposed the mansion's personnel and various animals and insects to a highly contagious and mutagenic biological agent known as the T-virus.|$|E
5|$|Players {{control the}} player {{character}} Kid Klown as {{he attempts to}} rescue Princess Honey from the villain Black Jack. The game's graphics are presented in an isometric view as Kid Klown automatically moves down a path to thwart Black Jack's plans of blowing up one of his spade bombs in each level. Various obstacles cause Kid Klown to slow down if they collide with him; if Kid Klown <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> to the bomb in time or if he is hit too many times, the level is lost. The game consists of 5 stages. In each stage, Kid Klown must find all 4 card suit orbs and stop the bomb to complete the level. At {{the end of each}} stage Kid Klown gets a key which in turn at the ending could be of use to unlock Honey's cage. If the player gets all 4 orbs in the very first turn, Kid Klown also gets a Honey heart. After the fifth stage Kid Klown must find the correct lock out of the 10 locks to unlock Honey's cage.|$|E

5|$|Velázquez {{uses this}} light {{not only to}} add volume and {{definition}} to each form but also to define the focal points of the painting. As the light streams in from the right it brightly glints on the braid and golden hair of the female dwarf, who is nearest the light source. But because her face is turned from the light, and in shadow, its tonality <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> a point of particular interest. Similarly, the light glances obliquely on the cheek of the lady-in-waiting near her, but not on her facial features. Much of her lightly coloured dress is dimmed by shadow. The Infanta, however, stands in full illumination, and with her face turned towards the light source, even though her gaze is not. Her face is framed by the pale gossamer of her hair, setting her apart from {{everything else in the}} picture. The light models the volumetric geometry of her form, defining the conic nature of a small torso bound rigidly into a corset and stiffened bodice, and the panniered skirt extending around her like an oval candy-box, casting its own deep shadow which, by its sharp contrast with the bright brocade, both emphasises and locates the small figure as the main point of attention.|$|E

25|$|Aristotle also {{includes}} in {{his theory of}} dreams what constitutes a dream and what does not. He claimed that a dream is first established {{by the fact that}} the person is asleep when they experience it. If a person had an image appear for a moment after waking up or if they see something in the dark it is not considered a dream because they were awake when it occurred. Secondly, any sensory experience that actually occurs while a person is asleep and is perceived by the person while asleep does not qualify as part of a dream. For example, if, while a person is sleeping, a door shuts and in their dream they hear a door is shut, Aristotle argues that this sensory experience is not part of the dream. The actual sensory experience is perceived by the senses, the fact that it occurred while the person was asleep <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> part of the dream. Lastly, the images of dreams must be a result of lasting impressions of sensory experiences had when awake.|$|E
25|$|The custom in Québec {{was similar}} to the one in France until 1981. Women would {{traditionally}} go by their husbands' surname in daily life, but their maiden name remained their legal name. Since the passage of a 1981 provincial law intended to promote gender equality as outlined in the Québec Charter of Rights, no change may be made to a person's name without the authorization of the registrar of civil status or the authorization of the court. Newlyweds who wish to change their names upon marriage must therefore go through the same procedure as those changing their names for other reasons. The registrar of civil status may authorize a name change if: 1) the name the person generally uses does not correspond to the name on their birth certificate, 2) the name is of foreign origin or too difficult to pronounce or write in its original form, or 3) the name invites ridicule or has become infamous. This law <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> legal for a woman to immediately change her name upon marriage, as marriage is not listed among the reasons for a name change.|$|E

500|$|Nonetheless {{for all of}} {{his wealth}} and {{innovation}} Little's ignominious end ensured he was quickly forgotten, and by the time Edwin Lefèvre published his now-classic Reminiscences of a Stock Operator in 1923 he was virtually unknown. To demonstrate this Lefèvre details asking nine seasoned members of the NYSE whether or not they had ever heard of Jacob Little before; only three of them did, and none could name who he was or what he had done, only knowing of his existence from having heard his name before. Lefèvre provided for this fact by saying [...] "what happened to Jacob was no more than what happens to thousands every year. The difference in degree <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> more memorable." [...] Though it had once been that [...] "on change his tread was that of a king", today Little has been relegated to obscurity, and survives only as a footnote in histories of the stock market.|$|E
500|$|In {{contrast}} to Popper, the philosopher Thomas Kuhn {{argued that it}} was not lack of falsifiability that makes astrology unscientific, but rather that the process and concepts of astrology are non-empirical. Kuhn thought that, though astrologers had, historically, made predictions that categorically failed, this in itself <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> unscientific, nor do attempts by astrologers to explain away failures by claiming that creating a horoscope is very difficult. Rather, in Kuhn's eyes, astrology is not science because it was always more akin to medieval medicine; they followed a sequence of rules and guidelines for a seemingly necessary field with known shortcomings, but they did no research because the fields are not amenable to research, and so [...] "they had no puzzles to solve and therefore no science to practise." [...] While an astronomer could correct for failure, an astrologer could not. An astrologer could only explain away failure but could not revise the astrological hypothesis in a meaningful way. As such, to Kuhn, even if the stars could influence the path of humans through life astrology is not scientific.|$|E
500|$|Writing for a {{majority}} of the Court, Justice Anthony Kennedy held that Drayton and Brown were not seized and their consent to the search was voluntary. He explained that [...] "aw enforcement officers do not violate the Fourth Amendment's prohibition of unreasonable seizures merely by approaching individuals on the street or in other public places and putting questions to them if they are willing to listen". Additionally, Justice Kennedy emphasized that [...] "f a reasonable person would feel free to terminate the encounter, then he or she has not been seized". Citing the Court's analytic framework established in Florida v. Bostic, Justice Kennedy concluded that a reasonable person would have felt free to [...] "leav the bus or otherwise terminat the encounter". Justice Kennedy noted that the officers did not brandish weapons, they did not make [...] "intimidating movements", they left the aisle clear, and they [...] "spoke to passengers one by one and in a polite, quiet voice". He noted that [...] "t is beyond question that had this encounter occurred on the street, it would be constitutional", {{and the fact that the}} encounter occurred on a bus <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> illegal.|$|E

500|$|Dorothy Gale (Ashanti) is an {{orphaned}} {{teenage girl}} {{living in a}} trailer park in Kansas. Her Aunt Em (Queen Latifah) and Uncle Henry (David Alan Grier) own a diner, to which Dorothy works for room and board. Her {{dream of becoming a}} singer is slim, but when waiting on some truckers Dorothy overhears that the Muppets are conducting a cross-country show called [...] "Star Hunt" [...] and are looking for a backup singer. Aunt Em disapproves, but with Uncle Henry's best wishes, she goes to the audition. However, the Muppets are about to end the audition, and Dorothy only manages to give them a demo CD that she created beforehand. In returning home, the civil defense sirens sound as a tornado is headed for Dorothy's trailer park. When Aunt Em and Uncle Henry run into the county storm shelter for safety, Dorothy hurries back to her family's mobile home to get Toto, her pet prawn. She <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> out in time, and the two are swept by the tornado across the vast fields of Kansas. When Dorothy climbs out of the wreckage, she finds that Toto (Pepé the King Prawn) can talk and that she is no longer in Kansas.|$|E
500|$|Eberhardt recommences {{working as}} a {{journalist}} for Barracund. Her marriage begins to break down as Slimene does not want her travel away from him. After reaching the outpost at Aïn Séfra, Eberhardt meets a French officer, Major Hubert Lyautey (Peter O'Toole). Despite their differences, the two respect each-other and soon become friends. Lyautey requests Eberhardt travel to Morocco to ask a marabout for permission to pursue a bandit into his territory. Eberhardt is conflicted about working for the French, though agrees to do it. After arriving in Morocco, however, she finds the marabout unwilling to make time to see her, and she becomes sick with malaria while waiting. Eberhardt is taken to a military hospital back in Aïn Séfra. Slimene vists her, and Eberhardt asks him to take her with him. Slimene takes her back to his small hut, and returns in the heavy rain to get medicine for her. While he is out he realises Eberhardt will be in danger from the growing amount of water, but he <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> back to the hut in time to save her. Inside her hut, Eberhardt realises she is in danger when {{it is too late}} and declares she wants to live an instant before a wall of water caves in the house, killing her. Eberhardt reads the final paragraph from her short story [...] "The Breath of Night" [...] in a voice over, as images of the desert and water appear on screen.|$|E
500|$|The episode {{received}} mixed-to-positive reviews. Tom Kessenich, in {{his book}} Examinations, gave the episode a largely positive review. He favorably compared the episode to the sixth season episode [...] "The Rain King" [...] and noted that [...] "'The Rain King' [...] was quite simply one of the joys of season six. So it hardly {{came as a surprise}} to me that I enjoyed Bell's 'The Goldberg Variation" [...] entry for [...] It was cute, light-hearted, and a little kooky, with a happy ending to boot." [...] Den of Geek writer Juliette Harrisson named the episode the [...] "finest stand-alone episode" [...] of Season Seven and wrote, [...] "Since 'The X-Files’ roots are in horror, feel-good episodes are few and far between, and something to be treasured when they appear. The Goldberg Variation is the perfect feel-good X-Files episode; not too soppy, not too harsh, but just the right mix of ludicrous gangster deaths and saving the cute kid." [...] Paula Vitaris from Cinefantastique gave the episode a moderately positive review and awarded it three stars out of four. She called the episode a [...] "charmer" [...] and praised Willie Garson's characterization of Harry Weems. Kenneth Silber from Space.com wrote positively of the episode, writing, [...] "'The Goldberg Variation' is a clever, witty standout from the recent middling run of X-Files episodes." [...] Todd VanDerWerff of The A.V. Club awarded the episode a [...] "B+" [...] and called it a [...] "fun" [...] entry that shows off the series' [...] "emotional palette". He felt that the episode successfully managed to convey a [...] "clever and whimsical" [...] feel, but that the conceit of a [...] "good man" [...] as the monster of the episode <b>does</b> <b>not</b> <b>make</b> <b>it</b> particularly scary. All-in-all, he felt that it [...] "all works out in the end".|$|E
