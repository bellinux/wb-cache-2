50|$|Despite {{the fact}} that the new BH Persona is {{classified}} as a B-segment saloon, as opposed to the outgoing C-segment CM Persona, it offers more headroom, comparable rear legroom and a significantly larger boot thanks to more efficient design and packaging. Nonetheless, the larger interior volume in the BH, made possible by short overhangs and increased height {{come at the expense of}} more balanced exterior proportions. Additionally, the new Persona is fitted with more basic gooseneck boot hinges as opposed to the old model's space saving, albeit costly twin <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> hinges.|$|R

50|$|Fiberglass, {{hard plastic}} or {{aluminum}} tonneau covers are also common. Some may be painted {{to match the}} truck, are solid in construction, and can be locked. These covers are usually heavy and require <b>gas</b> <b>struts</b> to assist in opening and closing. They operate much like a vehicle's hood, typically opening from the tailgate {{end of the bed}} (back to front). Some have multiple compartments that open front to back, back to front, side to side, or even rise vertically. Fiberglass, hard plastic or aluminum tonneau covers are sometimes installed as a factory option on new vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The Proton Persona (CM) was {{unveiled}} on 15 August 2007 as the decisive successor to Proton's ageing Wira saloon range. The CM Persona was {{largely based on}} the then three-year-old Proton GEN•2 hatchback platform, albeit modified to fit saloon specifications. The entire section aft of the B-pillar was re-engineered, amounting to a 167mm length extension over the GEN•2. The extended rear overhang incorporates a larger 430-litre boot, while the boot lid itself was redesigned and features space-saving twin <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> hinges. Rear headroom in the Persona was also increased by 43mm over the GEN•2 courtesy of a redesigned rear roof design.|$|R

40|$|Joint contractures {{which do}} not respond to {{conventional}} physiotherapy can be difficult to treat. Serial plastering has been used effectively but is expensive, inconvenient to the patient and does not permit daily hygiene or clinical inspection. A mechanical device has been developed consisting a hinged orthosis which spans the affected joint to which is attached a <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> to provide a corrective moment about the anatomical joint. Such an arrangement enables prescribed corrective moments to be applied accurately following clinical assessment using routine physiotherapy techniques. The inherently low spring rate of a <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> ensures that the specified corrective torque is maintained as correction occurs. Initial treatment experience {{under the control of the}} developers had generated wider interest in the system. A geographically distant independent orthotic supply centre was trained in the techniques of application. They treated nine elbow and three knee joints in patients who had not responded to physiotherapy treatment. All of the patients experienced improvement. The average for elbow joints was a reduction in the contracture of 25. 6 ° with a corrective moment of 6. 8 Nm over a period of 3. 9 weeks. For the knee joints the averages were a reduction in contracture of 10. 7 ° with a corrective moment of 12. 7 Nm over a period of 4 weeks. The results confirmed the practicality of transferring the system to independent clinical centres and provide evidence to support funding for a formal prospective clinical trial of the treatment approach...|$|R
40|$|The strut {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} components in a vehicle suspension system; however, it is also one of the most difficult elements to model owing to its highly nonlinear characteristics. In this paper a non-linear <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> model built in the software package Bathfp is presented. Both analytical and parametric modelling methods were used in the representation of different components in the strut. Simulations at various frequencies showed good agreement with experimental results. A sensitivity analysis of strut performance is presented at the end of the paper. It was found that the damper valve characteristics, the rod diameter, the temperature, and the user-defined polytropic index significantly affect the strut performance...|$|R

40|$|It is {{no wonder}} that demand of {{adjustable}} desks is increasing in the world. People are dealing with long hours sitting down and many have musculoskeletal system problems due to this. Our idea started with this concept but then we applied it for the Reykjavík University workshop which really needs better facilities to keep your laptop and other equipment out of harm's way while working on projects. Our idea is to make an affordable adjustable desk that is suitable for a workshop environment. It will only be mechanical, unlike most desks which are driven by electrical motors. To reduce the gravitational force of the desk we will use <b>gas</b> <b>struts,</b> this will give the desk more flowing motion. The desk met all our requirements. After building the desk we tested it and can withstand 200 kg on the top and can be pushed from all sides with 50 kg without flexing.

40|$|Gas struts {{are widely}} used in vehicle suspensions. However, they are highly {{non-linear}} and conventional linear models are not sufficient to describe their complex behaviour. In this paper, two non-linear <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> models with different modelling approaches are presented. One is based on grey-box methods using the modular dynamic simulation package Bathfp, whrer both physical parameters and experimental data are used to model the strut. The other uses black-box methods in Matlab, where artificial neural networks are employed and experimental data are used to train the model. Simulation studies demonstrate that the neural network model is more suitable for real vehicle simulations, whereas the Bathfp model is more appropriate for detailed system dynamics analysis, especially isos-frequency studies. Since the Bathfp model is able to predict the strut performance when certain parameters in the system are changed and can be easility integrated into different vehicle models, it is a useful design tool for both strut manufacturers and automotive original equipment manufacturers...|$|R
40|$|It is {{extremely}} difficult to maintain simultaneously a high standard of ride, handling, and body control in a vehicle with a conventional passive suspension. However, {{it is well known that}} active suspensions provide a possible solution to this problem, albeit with additional cost and weight. This paper describes the design and analysis of a hydropneumatic slow active suspension. The design is based on hydropneumatic suspension components taken from a commercial system. A non-linear quarter-car model is developed, which includes a <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> model developed in a previous study and a non-linear dynamic flow control valve model. A hybrid control strategy is proposed for the disturbance rejection and self-levelling requirements. The disturbance rejection control is based on limited state feedbacks and the linear quadratic method plus a Kalman filter that is used to optimize the performance index. The self-levelling control employs a proportional, integral, and derivative (PID) control strategy. Practical issues, such as power consumption, controller robustness, and valve dynamics, are also investigated in this paper. Simulations show that the proposed system has good performance and robustness...|$|R
50|$|The Chepeko was Carlton's first {{project to}} produce a kit car that was easy to build, and {{reasonably}} practical for everyday use. To this end, {{it was based on}} the floorpan (chassis) of a 1960s Volkswagen Beetle coupled with the available range of engines that would mate with the drivetrain. It was a two-seater, with gull-wing doors. The kit comprised a one-piece body shell, built from separate glass-fibre mouldings bonded together. Other parts included mouldings for the two doors and bonnet, plus door <b>gas</b> <b>struts,</b> hinges and catches, and four side windows in moulded acrylic sheet. The front and rear screens were not in the kit, but could be sourced as the rear screens of 1970s Vauxhall estate cars. The kit was produced from 1975 to 1976. The design changed several times throughout the production run of less than 20, including restyling of the rear end, and the provision of separate engine cover, headlight covers, instrument box, and sunroof panels. Length 166 in, width 66 in, height 45 in, wheelbase 94.5 in.|$|R
50|$|The Toyota Sera is of a steel {{monocoque}} construction {{with a low}} and rounded body shape. It is a 3-door hatchback coupe (sometimes referred to a liftback). The Sera's most distinctive feature is its butterfly doors, which are hinged {{at the top and}} bottom of the A pillar and open forward and up in a manner similar to the McLaren F1 and Saleen S7 - the McLaren F1 designer Gordon Murray cited the Sera as the inspiration of the F1's door arrangement. The weight of the door is predominantly supported by a thick <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> and counterbalanced by a smaller secondary strut inside the door to help take into account changes in temperature. Unlike the conventional side-opening doors on most cars, the Sera door can be opened fully in a fairly confined space, requiring only 43 cm of lateral clearance. The Alfa Romeo Stradale is believed to be the first car to feature dihedral doors which, like the Sera, features windows that curve upward into the 'roof' section of the vehicle.|$|R
50|$|In 2003, Hyundai {{responded to}} some of the {{customer}} complaints and suggestions such as the fact that the hood used a prop and not <b>gas</b> <b>struts,</b> there was no light in the glove compartment, and the car itself did not have enough power. In 2003, Hyundai introduced the 3.5-liter V6 in addition to the other two gas engines in North America. The bigger engine came with a computer-controlled four-wheel drive system. Automatic transmission models were given a chrome shift gate surround as opposed to the matte silver plastic style used in the 2001 and 2002 models. A Monsoon high-performance sound system came standard on the mid-level GLS model and came with a 6-disc CD changer on the top-tier LX. Rounding out the changes in the 2003 model was the discontinuation of the highly unpopular Pine Green which in some owner circles has gained the nickname 'Yucky Green'. In Australia, the four-cylinder Santa Fe was dropped in 2003, due to slow sales, leaving the 2.7L V6 automatic as the only model.|$|R

5000|$|Some makes of air guns {{incorporate}} a gas spring (commonly {{referred to as}} a gas piston, <b>gas</b> ram, <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> or nitro piston) instead of a mechanical coil spring. The spring itself is essentially a stand-alone enclosed piston pump without outlet and with pressurized air or inert gas (such as nitrogen) held tightly sealed within the cylinder. When the gun is cocked, the gas inside the cylinder gets further compressed by the piston, stores potential energy and acts in effect as a pneumatic accumulator. Gas spring units require higher precision to manufacture, since they require a low-friction sliding seal that can withstand the high pressures when cocked. The advantages of the gas spring include the ability to keep the gun cocked and ready to fire for extended periods of time without long-term spring fatigue, smoother recoil pattern and lower vibration, and faster [...] "lock time" [...] (the time between pulling the trigger and the pellet being discharged) which results in better accuracy. Gas spring air guns are also usually less [...] "hold-sensitive" [...] and hence easier to achieve consistent shot groupings.|$|R

40|$|A {{proposed}} <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> {{system would}} separate a liquid-fueled second rocket stage from a solid-fueled first stage using {{an array of}} pre-charged struts. The strut would be a piston-and-cylinder mechanism containing a compressed gas. Adiabatic expansion of the gas would drive {{the extension of the}} strut. The strut is designed to produce a force-versus-time profile, chosen to prevent agitation of the liquid fuel, in which the force would increase from an initial low value to a peak value, then decay {{toward the end of the}} stroke. The strut would include a piston chamber and a storage chamber. The piston chamber would initially contain gas at a low pressure to provide the initial low separation force. The storage chamber would contain gas at a higher pressure. The piston would include a longitudinal metering rod containing an array of small holes, sized to restrict the flow gas between the chambers, that would initially not be exposed to the interior of the piston chamber. During subsequent expansion, the piston motion would open more of the metering holes between the storage and piston chambers, thereby increasing the flow of gas into the piston chamber to produce the desired buildup of force...|$|R

40|$|Passive {{suspensions}} {{have been}} developed to a high level of sophistication but in order to further improve vehicle performance it is important to fully understand the dynamic behaviour of the suspension components using mathematical simulation. One of the most important components in a vehicle suspension system is the strut. Since it is highly non-linear it is difficult to predict its performance characteristics using a mathematical model. However, neural networks have been successfully used as universal 'black-box' models in the identification and control of non-linear systems. In this paper this approach has been used to model a novel <b>gas</b> <b>strut</b> and the neural network was trained with experimental data obtained in the laboratory from simulated road profiles. The results obtained from the neural network demonstrated good agreement with the experimental results over a wide range of operating conditions. In contrast, a linearised mathematical model using least square estimates of system parameters was shown to perform badly due to the highly non-linear nature of the system. A quarter-car mathematical model was developed in order to compare the linearised model with the model that used a neural network to predict strut behaviour. It was shown that the two models produced significantly different predictions of ride performance and it was argued that the neural network was preferable as it included the effects of non-linearities. Although the neural network model does not provide a good physical understanding of the component behaviour it is argued that it is a useful tool for assessing vehicle ride and NVH performance due to its good computational efficiency and accuracy...|$|R

40|$|Annandale sponges (Radiospongilla cerebellata) have chlorellae as endosymbiotic {{algae and}} are {{distributed}} throughout the freshwaters of southwestern Japan. Gemmules of this sponge hatch only under an illuminated condition. The hatch is perfectly inhibited in total darkness.

Gemmules also fail to hatch unless the surface of incubating media is freely exposed to the atmosphere. Photosynthetic inhibitors strongly suppressed the hatching even under the optimal temperature and fully illuminated condition. To understand role of air components and photosynthesis on the gemmule hatch, we examined gaseous elements of the air and found that oxygen and carbon dioxide were responsible for the gemmule <b>hatch.</b> These <b>gases</b> are also evolved or consumed by photosynthesis. When oxygen was evacuated from the incubating media, no gemmules were hatched. On the other hand, gemmules incubated in a medium containing excess carbon dioxide did not germinate even under the optimal illuminated condition. This suggests that gemmule germination of the Annandale sponges seems to be initiated by oxygen and suppressed by carbon dioxide. This suggests that the both gasses might be evolved in or consumed from hibernating gemmule cells by photosynthesis of symbiotic algae to induce germination in these animal cells...|$|R
