5000|$|The {{original}} designer Robert Mainhardt {{enlisted the}} help of his friend Nick Minchakievich of Pleasanton, California, before 1962, in helping to stabilize the projectiles or ammunition. Minchakievich first developed retractable fins after rear ignition proved too dangerous. But the retractable fins proved too expensive, requiring advanced machining during production. The two experimental calibers with retractable fins were 6mm and 13mm. (Livermore Labs, p. 42.) Rushed for a solution due to the possibility of large government contracts, Minchakievich then quickly and ingeniously invented diagonal vented ports to make the projectiles or ammunition spin while advancing, thus relatively stabilize the projectiles using centrifugal force. This method was used in all the Mainhardt calibers for the Gyrojet. Minchakievich warned Mainhardt that rushing the project would only make the pistol shoddy and unreliable. Working for free out of his Livermore Aerospace Plastics Lab, Minchakievich requested six more months to perfect an accurate projectile, and make the Gyrojet more famous than the Colt Peacemaker. Mainhardt and the Air Force declined as current ordnance and technology was in demand for Vietnam. Minchakievich even attempted a marketing strategy by enlisting the help of Gene Roddenberry in using the pistol on Star Trek. Although Roddenberry loved the Gyrojet, he wanted a [...] "ray gun" [...] and not a pistol that merely shot a rocket projectile, no matter how advanced for the twentieth century. (Paramount Pictures, Correspondence, vol. XIX, p. 1309.) MBA projectiles are still found at building sites on Sycamore Creek Way and Happy Valley Road in Pleasanton where Minchakievich lived and did some experimentation. When spin stabilization was chosen for the Gyrojet, the compact electronics used in today's smart bullets were not available. [...] Both the cost and size of <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>equipment</b> have decreased greatly since a Gyrojet launcher was reviewed in Guns and Ammo Magazine in 1965.|$|E
30|$|It {{is clear}} from the {{observed}} imagery that the image is de-focused. For example, the signal return of an aircraft above the leftmost hangar (Target 1) appears to be completely smeared. In addition, signal returns are not registered in their appropriate locations, such as Targets 2 and 4 (aircraft hangars) which appear shifted. Furthermore, Target 3 appears as multiple peaks in the image, implying asymmetric sidelobe levels in the PSF. These artefacts are due to the accuracy and update rate of the GPS receiver onboard the helicopter which are inadequate to sample trajectory deviations sufficiently, plus the absence of <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>equipment</b> which was unfortunately outside our control.|$|E
40|$|Image-based mobile mapping systems enable an {{efficient}} acquisition of georeferenced image sequences, {{which can be}} used for geo-data capture in subsequent steps. In order to provide accurate measurements in a given reference frame while e. g. aiming at high fidelity 3 D urban models, high quality georeferencing of the captured multi-view image sequences is required. Moreover, sub-pixel accurate orientations of these highly redundant image sequences are needed in order to optimally perform steps like dense multi-image matching as a prerequisite for 3 D point cloud and mesh generation. While direct georeferencing of image-based mobile mapping data performs well in open areas, poor GNSS coverage in urban canyons aggravates fulfilling these high accuracy requirements, even with high-grade <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> <b>equipment.</b> Hence, we conducted comprehensive investigations aiming at assessing the quality of directly georeferenced sensor orientations as well as the expected improvement by image-based georeferencing in a challenging urban environment. Our study repeatedly delivered mean trajectory deviations of up to 80 cm. By performing image-based georeferencing using bundle adjustment for a limited set of cameras and a limited number of ground control points, mean check point residuals could be lowered from approx. 40 cm to 4 cm. Furthermore, we showed that largely automated image-based georeferencing is capable of detecting and compensating discontinuities in directly georeferenced trajectories...|$|E

30|$|Consequently, {{inertial}} sensors are inaccurate and {{unsuitable for}} positioning applications {{over an extended}} period of time and are usually utilized to supplement other navigation systems, such as GPS, to provide a higher degree of accuracy than is possible with the use of any single system (Maklouf and Adwaib 2014).

40|$|The paper {{describes}} design {{issues for}} MEMS-based pedestrian <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> systems. By now the algorithms to estimate navigation parameters for strap-down <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> systems {{on the basis}} of plural observations have been already well developed. At the same time mathematical and software processing of information in the case of pedestrian <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> systems has its specificity, due to the peculiarities of their functioning and exploitation. Therefore, there is an urgent task to enhance existing fusion algorithms for use in pedestrian navigation systems. For this purpose the article analyzes the characteristics of the hardware composition and configuration of existing systems of this class. The paper shows advantages of various technical solutions. Relying on their main features it justifies a choice of the navigation system architecture and hardware composition enabling improvement of the estimation accuracy of user position as compared to the systems using only inertial sensors. The next point concerns the development of algorithms for complex processing of heterogeneous information. To increase an accuracy of the free running pedestrian <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> system we propose an adaptive algorithm for joint processing of heterogeneous information based on the fusion of inertial info rmation with magnetometer measurements using EKF approach.

A Global Positioning System module is able to accurately determine position without sensor drift, but its usage is limited in heavily urbanized environments and heavy vegetation.

With the {{rotation}} modulation, a strapdown <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> system (INS) can keep high accuracy navigation without high accuracy gyro and high accuracy accelerometer. Firstly {{we give the}} error equation of strapdown INS, and then deduct the navigation error propagation of system.

Form global analysis way, the navigation error roused by constant error and the modulation effects are deducted here. 1. The technology scheme of single axis rotation error modulation The strapdown INS navigation error automatic compensation is based on inertial system error spread rule, it improves navigation precision effectively. One of the most typical, the most common automatic compensation error suppression method is rotating modulation [1 - 3]. Rotating modulation technology {{as a kind of}} inertial components deviation modulate the measurement components [4 - 5] deviation and counteract the influence of the system accuracy [6] caused by component offset by means of rotating inertia measurement components around a shaft or more axis, so as to improve the strapdown <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> system long time work precision.

40|$|Navigation is {{a highly}} {{challenging}} aspect of an autonomous vehicle’s operation. For autonomous underwater vehicles, this becomes even more difficult due to {{the complexities of the}} underwater environment and the restricted availability of GPS signals. Amidst the variety of navigation methods that are commonly used for underwater <b>navigation,</b> <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> is the most self-contained. Until recently, the high cost of <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> systems did not allow for their use by small to medium enterprises, but the advent of low cost <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> systems has recently made this technique a more pragmatic option for inexpensive projects. These devices however, have their limitations, with inherent errors that accumulate with time. While manufacturers publish the accuracy of <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> device’s internal components (such as accelerometers, gyroscopes and magnetometers), it is not immediately evident how these figures directly affect navigational accuracy because of compensation strategies between these components. This study empirically demonstrates the practical performance of a commercially viable <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> system, analyses the observable errors and assesses strategies for performance enhancement, such as by using Kalman filters to combine data from other devices. For reasons of practicality, the experimental studies were principally undertaken using a land vehicle that followed particular pathways from which the accuracy of the <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> could be easily determined. Finally, underwater experimental trials were conducted to evaluate the performance of the low cost <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> system underwater. This thesis also demonstrates the achievable range of performances using devices with particular specifications. It is concluded that even though commercially affordable <b>inertial</b> <b>navigation</b> systems alone are not reliable, they can form a reliable core of navigation systems when they are aided by other devices via a Kalman filter, various architectures of which are also presented in this thesis.
