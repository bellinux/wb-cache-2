25|$|Self-esteem {{may make}} people {{convinced}} they deserve happiness. Understanding this is fundamental, and universally beneficial, since {{the development of}} positive self-esteem increases the capacity to treat other people with respect, benevolence and goodwill, thus favoring rich interpersonal relationships and avoiding destructive ones.

On the contrary, an attitude of love toward themselves will be found <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> {{who are capable of}} loving others.

Visaria states that female deficit among Muslims was markedly higher, next only to Sikhs. South India region was an exception reporting excess females overall, which scholars attribute partly to selective emigration of males and the regional practice of matriarchy.|$|E

25|$|After {{a period}} of {{hyperinflation}} in the late 1940s when the Kuomintang (KMT) military regime of Chen Yi overprinted the new Taiwan Yuan against the previous Japan Taiwan Yen, {{it became clear that}} a new and stable currency was needed. When the KMT government retreated to Taiwan after the loss of mainland China in the Chinese Civil War, it brought part of the precious metal and foreign currency reserve of mainland China to the island. Although war-ravaged China had held only a very small reserve, some $170 million <b>in</b> <b>all,</b> <b>those</b> reserves helped to establish a gold-standard reserve currency in Taiwan, which in turn helped to stabilize prices and reduce hyperinflation. More importantly, many of the Chinese intellectual and business elites moved with KMT to the island. The Japanese had built up the agricultural and industrial infrastructure as well as chemical, material, and food reserves on the island that allowed the elite of the KMT supporters to jump start their own economic endeavors. Along with the $4 billion in financial aid and soft credit provided by the US (as well as the indirect economic stimulus of US food and military aid) over the 1945-1965 period, Taiwan had the necessary capital to restart its economy. Further, the KMT government instituted many laws and land reforms that it had never effectively enacted on mainland China.|$|E

500|$|Cagney's {{portrayal}} of Cody Jarrett in the 1949 film White Heat {{is one of}} his most memorable. Cinema had changed in the 10 years since Walsh last directed Cagney (in The Strawberry Blonde), and the actor's {{portrayal of}} gangsters had also changed. Unlike Tom Powers in The Public Enemy, Jarrett was portrayed as a raging lunatic with few if any sympathetic qualities. In the 18 intervening years, Cagney's hair had begun to gray, and he developed a paunch for the first time. He was no longer a romantic commodity, and this was reflected in his performance. Cagney himself had the idea of playing Jarrett as psychotic; he later stated, [...] "it was essentially a cheapie one-two-three-four kind of thing, so I suggested we make him nuts. It was agreed so we put <b>in</b> <b>all</b> <b>those</b> fits and headaches." ...|$|E
