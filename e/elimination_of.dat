5|$|A direct {{consequence}} of the invasion was the almost total <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> the old English aristocracy {{and the loss of}} English control over the Catholic Church in England. William systematically dispossessed English landowners and conferred their property on his continental followers. The Domesday Book meticulously documents the impact of this colossal programme of expropriation, revealing that by 1086 only about 5 per cent of land in England south of the Tees was left in English hands. Even this tiny residue was further diminished in the decades that followed, the <b>elimination</b> <b>of</b> native landholding being most complete in southern parts of the country.|$|E

40|$|We {{consider}} the possibility of free receptor (antigen/cytokine) levels rebounding to higher than the baseline level after one or more applications of an antibody drug using a target-mediated drug disposition model. Using geometry and dynamical systems analysis, we show that rebound will occur {{if and only if}} the <b>elimination</b> rate <b>of</b> the drug-receptor product is slower than the <b>elimination</b> rates <b>of</b> the drug and of the receptor. We also analyse the magnitude of rebound through approximations and simulations and demonstrate that it increases if the drug dose increases or if the difference between the <b>elimination</b> rate <b>of</b> the drug-receptor product and the minimum <b>of</b> the <b>elimination</b> rates <b>of</b> the drug and of the receptor increases. © 2013 Springer-Verlag Berlin Heidelberg...|$|R
