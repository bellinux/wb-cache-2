50|$|The <b>traditional</b> <b>sedans</b> with full-width bench seating offered {{nearly the}} same {{passenger}} capacity as the newer three-row SUV or minivan. Some models, such as the Chrysler Pacifica, feature a center console in the second row, rather than room for a passenger in the middle.|$|R

50|$|The {{bi-parting}} doors typically {{feature a}} longer {{front door and}} a short rear door, without a pillar in between. The configuration offers both a more 'sporty' aesthetic than compared to a <b>traditional</b> <b>sedan,</b> and the utility of 4-doors, though the doors operate inter-subdependently. This means that the forward door must always be opened before the rear-door (which opens in a rear-hinged fashion) can be opened.|$|R
50|$|The Sigma {{designation}} disappeared {{with the}} 1990 model. A new hardtop liftback model was added in 1988, called the (Mitsubishi Eterna). and in Japan, the Eterna was only {{sold at a}} specific retail chain called Car Plaza. This generation Galant was also sold in Canada as the Dodge 2000GTX and Eagle 2000GTX. The five-door liftback version was never offered in North America, where buyers prefer <b>traditional</b> <b>sedans.</b> Sales ended in 1993.|$|R
5000|$|For the 1955 {{model year}} the Fairlane name {{replaced}} the Crestline as Ford's premier full-sized offering. Six different body styles were offered, including the Crown Victoria Skyliner with a tinted, transparent plastic roof, the regular Crown Victoria coupe {{with lots of}} stainless steel trim, a convertible Sunliner, the Victoria hardtop coupe, and <b>traditional</b> <b>sedans.</b> All featured the trademark stainless-steel [...] "Fairlane stripe" [...] on the side. Power options were a 223 CID L straight-6 engine and a 272 CID L V8. The 292 CID L Y-block was offered as an option and was called the Thunderbird V-8.|$|R
2500|$|All {{versions}} {{with the}} exception of the wagon were usually fitted with the four round tail lights that had become a regular feature to the Skyline's design. The wagon had different tail lights, headlights, and no turbo or six-cylinder versions available. It more closely resembled a Nissan Sunny than a Skyline. The two-door coup√© had a hardtop, pillarless design, and featured roll-down quarter windows for the rear seat passengers (a styling feature of the previous C10, C110, and C211 coupes), while four-door versions had a <b>traditional</b> <b>sedan</b> body style with framed windows. The crease that appeared over the rear wheels beginning with the second generation, referred to as the [...] "surf line", no longer appeared starting with this generation.|$|R
5000|$|Within {{six months}} of the Airflow's introduction, the vehicle was a sales disaster. Adding insult to injury, General Motors mounted an {{advertising}} campaign aimed at further discrediting the Airflows. Most automotive historians, though, agree that the Airflow was shunned in large part because buyers did not like its looks. The hood, waterfall grille, headlamps, and fenders were all merged into one continuous form that was interpreted as an [...] "anonymous lump". While thoroughly modern, the public was slow to embrace the Airflow. At the depth of the Great Depression, the car seemed to be too advanced, too different for many consumers. While Airflows sold in respectable numbers in its first year, Chrysler's <b>traditional</b> <b>sedans</b> and coupes far outsold the Airflow by 2.5 to one, with first year Airflow sales at 10,839 units.|$|R

50|$|All had {{a slight}} face lift for the 1985 model year. The Corcel II became known again simply as the Corcel. The {{interior}} was now {{the same for all}} four models. Externally, the Corcel and the Del Rey differed at the rear; the Corcel received fastback-style bodywork while the Del Rey was of a more <b>traditional</b> <b>sedan</b> design. The Belina and the Scala, however, had by now lost nearly all of their interior/exterior differences and became near identical: only a few details, such as the taillamps, differentiated these two models. Between 1985 and 1987 the Belina was made available with the same four-wheel-drive system used in the Pampa. This system seemed to have questionable reliability; Quatro Rodas magazine did a long-term test of a Belina 4x4 (50,000 km) in which breakdowns were very frequent - the resulting bad reputation led to Belina 4x4 production ending after only a few model years, while the Pampa 4x4 continued to be available.|$|R
5000|$|The {{design of}} the car has been changed to a more {{conservative}} appearance. The [...] "fluidic sculpture" [...] design that persisted across the Hyundai portfolio since 2011 is gone in the sixth generation Elantra. The car is now more like a fastback with its roofline sloped from the windshield {{to the rear of}} the car and it has less curves overall with pentagonal head and tail lights, a hexagonal grille, and redesigned body panels and bumper emphasizing straight lines along the body. The windshield is drawn back from the hood further than the prior generation, making for a more <b>traditional</b> <b>sedan</b> look. The interior is also less curved, with a cockpit, audio/temp controls and glove compartment in a single bow line across the dash. This was done without reducing the interior cabin space of the prior generation at 110.2 cubic feet (while the Elantra is sold under the compact class, it classifies as a mid-size sedan according to the EPA.) ...|$|R
