As an initial feasibility study for a new intervention, based on cognitive behavioural and cognitive rehabilitation principles, relatively broad inclusion criteria were used.

Potential mechanisms for these findings will be discussed. A replication using a more rigorous randomised trial is currently underway. Griffith Health FacultyFull Tex...|$|E

40|$|This article {{discusses}} {{the common ground}} between psychological and spiritual care.

40|$|The {{service and}} {{evaluation}} {{is funded by}} the Scottish Government through the Detect Cancer Early Programme. Background: Previous research has shown diagnosis or screening for cancer may be a ‘teachable moment’ for prevention through lifestyle change. Previous trials have been successful, but have been delivered via national programmes targeting patients being screened for colorectal cancer. This manuscript reports the protocol for a proof-of-concept study to assess the feasibility and acceptability of a lifestyle change service targeting men suspected or diagnosed with cancer of the prostate in a secondary care cancer service within the UK. Methods: Lifestyle change will be promoted through integration of a lifestyle change service in a Urology department in one NHS Board. The service is delivered by a <b>Health</b> <b>Psychologist</b> <b>and</b> uses Motivational Interviewing and behavioural change techniques to motivate and support patients to consider and address topics such as increasing physical activity and a healthy diet, smoking cessation, alcohol reduction and weight loss. A service evaluation will assess feasibility and acceptability via a patient experience survey, a survey exploring staff knowledge, attitudes and practice, pre- and post-intervention lifestyle behaviour survey, and an audit of routine patient database. Discussion: This pilot will assess the viability of using cancer testing and diagnosis as a ‘teachable moment’ for lifestyle change in a unique population (i. e. men with suspected cancer of the prostate). If successful, this approach offers potential for preventative services to enhance routine and person-centred clinical cancer care provided within secondary care settings.

40|$|A {{qualitative}} exploration {{was conducted}} of the conceptualisations {{of the process}} of change held by 10 independently employed <b>health</b> <b>psychologist</b> <b>and</b> counselling practitioners who work with clients with chronic health conditions in a context parallel to primary care. The health psychologists were in their early careers while the counsellors were older and had practiced longer. A thematic analysis of responses to semi-structured interviews found commonalities in intervention beliefs among the participants from the two professions, sharing two overarching themes of “Change can be prompted by expert techniques” and “Providing love and safety lets change happen”. These themes were believed to facilitate an end-state of healthy change in the patient/client. The health psychologists appeared to believe that techniques based on theories and evidence provided an appropriate basis for intervention while the counsellors appeared to believe that an eclectic mix of relational theory and selected techniques were sufficient to support their approach. The health psychologists and counsellors approached their clients/patients with different objectives, with the health psychologists focused on improved outcomes while the counsellors focused {{on the quality of the}} therapeutic relationship. A sub-theme of “Frustrated by lack of therapeutic skills” was derived from some of the health psychologists who believed that a lack of training in relational skills inhibited the quality and possibly the efficaciousness of face-to-face interventions whereas the counsellors appeared more confident in their practice and exhibited no similar frustration with their approach. It is suggested that the expert procedures in the Trans-Theoretical Model of behaviour change could provide the basis for additional relational training for health psychologists as this model derives from psychotherapeutic change theory and practice. Further research should be carried out to explore and test the utility of combining health psychological theory and evidence with relational approaches in health interventions in clients/patients with common chronic conditions.

40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{evaluate}} the impact of a health psychology-led bariatric rehabilitation service (BRS) on patient weight loss following bariatric surgery at 1 year. METHODS: A single-site open-randomised parallel group control trial based at St. Richard's Hospital in Chichester in the UK. Patients (n[*]=[*] 162) were recruited immediately prior to Roux-en-Y gastric bypass and randomly allocated to receive either treatment as usual (n[*]=[*] 80) or the BRS (n[*]=[*] 82). The BRS involved three 50 -min one-to-one sessions with a <b>health</b> <b>psychologist</b> <b>and</b> provided information, support and mentoring pre and post surgery addressing psychological issues such as dietary control, self esteem, coping and emotional eating. Weight loss was assessed at 1 year. The key outcome variable was BMI and change in BMI. RESULTS: Follow-up weight was available for 145 patients. Intention-to-treat analysis (n[*]=[*] 162) using last measured weights showed that mean change in BMI by 1 year post surgery was - 16. 49. There was no significant difference between the two groups (control group[*]=[*]- 16. 37, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 15. 15 - 17. 57; intervention[*]=[*]- 16. 6, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 15. 42 - 17. 81; η p (2) [*]=[*] 0. 001). Similarly, explanatory analysis (n[*]=[*] 145) showed a mean change in BMI of - 17. 17. The difference between the two groups was not significant (control group[*]=[*]- 16. 9, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 15. 78 - 18. 18; intervention[*]=[*]- 17. 35, 95 % CI[*]=[*] 18. 5 - 16. 16; η p (2) [*]=[*] 0. 001). CONCLUSIONS: Psychological support pre and post bariatric surgery had no impact on weight loss as measured by BMI and change in BMI by 1 year. It is argued that psychological support should be targeted to patients who start to demonstrate weight regain at a later stage. TRIAL REGISTRATION: ClinicalTrials. gov NCT 01264120...|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background Self {{management}} {{is the cornerstone}} of effective preventive care in diabetes. Educational interventions that provide self-management skills for people with diabetes have been shown to reduce blood glucose concentrations. This in turn has the potential to reduce rates of complications. However, evidence to support type, quantity, setting and mode of delivery of self-management education is sparse. Objectives: To study the biophysical and psychological effectiveness of a brief psycho-educational intervention for type 1 diabetes in adults. Methods/Design Design: Randomised controlled clinical trial. Setting: Multidisciplinary specialist diabetes centre. Hypothesis: Our hypothesis was that the brief (2. 5 -day) intervention would be biophysically and psychologically effective for people with type 1 diabetes. Intervention: A brief psycho-educational intervention for type 1 diabetes developed by a multi-professional team comprising of a consultant diabetologist, a diabetes specialist nurse, a specialist diabetes dietician and a clinical <b>health</b> <b>psychologist</b> <b>and</b> delivered in 20 hours over 2. 5 days. Primary outcomes: HbA 1 c and severe hypoglycaemia. Secondary outcomes: Blood pressure, weight, height, lipid profile and composite psychometric scales. Participants: We shall consent and recruit 120 subjects with postal invitations sent to eligible participants. Volunteers are to be seen at randomisation clinics where independent researcher verify eligibility and obtain consent. We shall randomise 60 to BITES and 60 to standard care. Eligibility Criteria: Type 1 diabetes for longer than 12 months, multiple injection therapy for at least two months, minimum age of 18 and ability to read and write. Randomisation: An independent evaluator to block randomise (block-size = 6), to intervention or control groups using sealed envelopes in strict ascendant order. Control group will receive standard care. Assessment: Participants in both groups would attend unblinded assessments at baseline, 3, 6 and 12 months, in addition to their usual care. After the intervention, usual care would be provided. Ethics approval: York Research Ethics Committee (Ref: 01 / 08 / 016) approved the study protocol. Discussion We hope the trial will demonstrate feasibility of a pragmatic randomised trial of BITES and help quantify therapeutic effect. A follow up multi-centre trial powered to detect this effect could provide further evidence. Trial registration Current Controlled Trials ISRCTN 75807800 </p...|$|E

40|$|Purpose: A {{societal}} {{response to}} the existence of substance misuse fluctuates between harm minimisation and prohibition. Until recently, little {{attention has been paid to}} the importance of the individual’s substance use experiences, which are vital to understanding the social and contextual reasons to understanding why someone chooses to use, and are therefore of imperative importance to facilitating the design and delivery of a substance use health promotion campaign. The purpose of this study is to investigate the efficacy of the television adverts shown as part of the previously unstudied ‘Talk to Frank’ intervention in relation to an individual’s perceived risk of taking a substance and their intent to use substances in the future. It is also to get a better understanding of the educational experiences surrounding substance use, in order to provide information to <b>health</b> <b>psychologists</b> devising <b>and</b> developing <b>health</b> promotion campaigns concerning substance use in the future. Design: A mixed-methods design was employed in order to quantitatively analyse the data collected from the study testing the efficacy of the ‘Talk to Frank’ intervention. To follow this, semi-structured interviews were conducted with a third of the study population to gain an understanding of their experiences of substance use education, and how this impacted their substance use experiences. Findings: The ‘Talk to Frank’ television adverts were unsuccessful at increasing perceived risk and reducing intent to use. However, a positive correlation was found between participants’ previous substance use scores and their intent to use substances in the future. The results of the qualitative analysis indicated that participants draw on a variety of ‘primary’, ‘secondary’ and ‘tertiary’ learning experiences to enhance their understanding of substance use, which therefore affects their substance use behaviour. Originality/value: This study calls for <b>health</b> <b>psychologists</b> <b>and</b> other <b>health</b> educators to focus on understanding the lived experiences of substance use education so that these findings can be implemented back into designing a more effective intervention.
