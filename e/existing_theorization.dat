The studies will be summarized {{in relation to their}} context, data collection, findings and GM model, and this will be done distinguishing the research studies based on their theoretical orientation (Byrnes 2009; Colombi 2006; Christie and Derewianka, 2008; Derewianka 2003 a; Mohan & Beckett, 2001; Painter 2003; Ryshina–Pankova 2010; Schleppegrell, 2004; Torr & Simpson, 2003). The reason why these particular studies are included in this paper is due to the publication year of the studies. The studies conducted following the emergence of the semantic model were included in order to reach a more comprehensive picture of GM theorization and application.|$|E
40|$|The aim of {{this thesis}} is to {{investigate}} how women's participation in the labour force affects the dynamics of power in gender relationships in contemporary Greece. Employment status has been considered as a crucial factor in determining women's power. Particular emphasis {{has been placed on}} relationships within the family setting and sexuality. The literature indicates firstly that family and sexuality are characterised by an imbalance of power in gender relationships. Secondly, it indicates that the family constitutes a major obstacle to women's participation in the labour force. The study applies a feminist approach within the context of theories of gender hierarchy and patriarchy. Thus, by taking into account the <b>existing</b> <b>theorization</b> about gender relationships and their constantly changing nature within all aspects of social life, this study aims to do the following: firstly, to investigate the compatibility of theoretical frameworks of patriarchy originating mainly from the UK and USA with empirical evidence of gender relationships in Greece; secondly, to provide an insight into the cultural valuations of the notions of power in gender relationships by comparing two different social settings within Greece: Athens, a cosmopolitan city, and Kastro, a small seaside village; and thirdly, to highlight how power defines the gender roles within family, employment and sexuality and in a reciprocal way how gender roles define the dynamics of power within heterosexual relationships. A total of fifty nine male and female participants - forty living in Athens and nineteen in Kastro - gave unstructured, face-to-face interviews. Participants were chosen to allow for differences in social class and employment status. All of the participants were married; this was because, firstly, pre-marital sexual relationships are not common in rural Greece, and secondly it was assumed that sexuality within marriage acquires a kind of legitimacy; it would therefore be easier and more justifiable for people to talk about it. Ethnographic studies carried out in Greece have served as a useful source of information about gender relationships, especially in rural areas. The research findings indicate that women's full time employment has an impact upon their sexual behaviour as well as upon men's sexual behaviour towards women. The findings also illustrate a wide range of variations other than polarization in gender power relationships firstly between men and women and secondly between those who live in Athens and in Kastro...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} effect of supply chain quality {{management}} (SCQM) practices on quality performance. Prior research theorizes that both TQM and SCM practices have a positive relationship with organisational performance (e. g. Kuei et al., 2001; Kahnali and Taghavi, 2010), because effective TQM and SCM {{has proved to be}} core to a firm’s competitive standing and deemed essential to achieve desired quality outcomes. In the light of the current globalised business environment, more recent research suggests that firms need to shift their internal focus on quality to encompass the globalization of their quality strategy and implement quality across the whole supply chain. In the extant literature, this has been referred to as supply chain quality management (SCQM). Hence, quality is now viewed as a common supply chain goal and perceived to be responsibility of the levels and actors in the supply chain. Exploring the interrelationships between TQM and SCM or SCQM practices, we encounter mixed results in the literature about their performance impact on quality outcomes and organisation as a whole (e. g., Lin et al. 2005; Sila et al., 2006; Kahnali and Taghavi, 2010). For example, most of previous research on the performance impact of SCQM practices has often been carried out at an aggregate level (i. e. viewing SCQM as a single construct), thereby concealing variation between individual practices of SCQM (e. g., Kuei et al, 2001; Kahnali and Taghavi, 2010; Zu and Kaynak, 2012; Lin et al., 2013). In this regard and given the multidimensionality of SCQM, we argue that the literature could be enriched by analysing the individual performance impact of each of SCQM practices on quality performance. Such individual level of analysis of SCQM practices not only supplement the existing dominant aggregate level analysis of SCQM, but also provides a platform for quality, supply chain and operations managers to identify the relative importance weight of individual SCQM practices and plan their operational and strategic priorities accordingly. Moreover, a major limitation of <b>existing</b> <b>theorization</b> of SCQM relates {{to the fact that they}} often explore the impact of SCQM practices on organisational performance. This implies that few studies have provided (mixed) accounts of the quality performance impact of SCQM practices and that the impact of SCQM practices on quality performance has remained ambiguous and controversial (see Lin et al. 2005; Kaynak and Hartley 2007; Kanji and Wong 1999; Kahnali and Taghavi 2010). The present paper seeks to attend to the aforementioned limitations with an empirical evaluation of the performance impact of SCQM practices on quality outcomes...|$|E
40|$|Memories {{collected}} {{across the}} life-course often inform {{our sense of}} who we are and what is important to us, as we grow older. This article draws on the findings of two qualitative life-history research projects that set out to explore older UK migrant women’s quality of life across the life course. It has two main aims. One aim is to contribute to <b>existing</b> <b>theorizations</b> of social memory. Another aim is to show the extent to which migrant women’s memories of life-altering events influence their satisfaction with life as they grow older. The article concludes by arguing for an approach to the study of ageing that is sensitive to the impact of memories on our experiences of growing older...|$|R
40|$|Attempts by {{policy-makers}} {{to encourage}} diasporas {{to engage in}} development in the Global South rely on conceptions of behaviour drawn from economics that emphasize individual choice, stimuli and motivations. This article argues that diasporas are better understood as ‘communities of practice’ in which actions are conceptualized {{as part of a}} wider social system based on embodied knowledge acquired through socialization, technology and the habituation of particular lifestyles. Using social theories of practice to analyze remittances draws attention to the symptomatic silences of dominant <b>theorizations</b> of behaviour. <b>Existing</b> <b>theorizations</b> underpin, and thereby uncritically endorse, potentially unsustainable development policies based on remittances. The alternative approach presented here opens up new areas for policy and research based on medium to long-term changes in the socio-technical remittance regime...|$|R
40|$|This article {{presents}} an ethnographic study of politics of waiting in a post-Soviet context. While activation has been explored in sociological and anthropological literature as a neo-liberal governmental technology and its application in post-socialist context {{has also been}} compellingly documented, waiting as a political artefact has only recently been receiving increased scholarly attention. Drawing on ethnographic fieldwork at a state-run unemployment office in Riga, this article shows how, alongside activation, state welfare policies also produce passivity and waiting. Engaging with the small but developing field of sociological literature {{on the politics of}} waiting, I argue that, rather than interpreting it as a clash between ‘neo-liberal’ and ‘Soviet’ regimes, we should understand the double-move of activation and imposition of waiting as a key mechanism of neo-liberal biopolitics. This article thus extends the <b>existing</b> <b>theorizations</b> of the temporal politics of neo-liberalism...|$|R
40|$|Migration, {{along with}} the implied geographies of the ethics of care {{literature}} and policy initiatives vis-à-vis care have increasingly led {{to the adoption of}} the ‘global’ as the most appropriate level for analysing care. Much of the empirical work underpinning analyses of care, however, was done at particular sites and had specific emphases that are now being adopted in the analysis of care globally. In this article, I suggest the need for empirical research {{from other parts of the}} world to inform, build on and challenge the <b>existing</b> <b>theorizations</b> of transnational care. Using examples from India, I highlight some ways in which (a) recognizing the varied genealogies of care in different places, (b) bringing together the literature on care diamonds with that on care chains, and (c) recognizing the diversity of family forms and the increasing transnationalization of markets, the state and civil society may enrich existing care chain analysis. I thus suggest that we need to explore what differences in the infrastructural architecture of care means for how we theorize care in the context of migration. I outline some elements of a new research agenda, not only for research on India but also for recognizing the importance of heterogeneous care arrangements in a globalizing world of care...|$|R
40|$|Corruption is {{a serious}} problem and social ethics has a {{significant}} impact on all societies. It is a phenomenon which is globally widespread and can be generally defined as the use of public power to benefit a private interest. It is a complex and multifaceted concept with several and heavy complications for the economy and environmental sustainability. Despite the <b>existing</b> <b>theorizations</b> and descriptions of the political economy concerning environment/society interactions and widespread evidence of bribery and illegal exchange in natural resources management, nowadays, fighting corruption goes on widely ineffective, with serious consequences for environmental quality. The main focus of this study is the different forms of corruption and its consequences and costs to the environment, especially in resource-rich developing countries. It explores a few practical examples taken from these countries due to the linkages between corruption and weak environmental governance. The institutional set-up of the country such as the characteristics of the political and judicial system determines the extent of corruption. In such a context, transparency {{has been described as a}} cure for corruption. Good governance including a broad commitment to the rule of law is crucial for environmental sustainability and is a way to put a stop to the devastating impact corruption has had on the environment. info:eu-repo/semantics/publishedVersio...|$|R
40|$|Abstract: For {{much of the}} 20 th century, the {{informal}} economy in advanced western nations was depicted as a leftover from an earlier mode of production and disappearing from view. In recent decades, however, with the recognition that it persists and is even growing, it has been variously re-theorized as either a direct by-product of late capitalism, an alterna-tive to formal work or a complement to the formal economy. To evaluate critically the validity of these rival theorizations {{of the relationship between}} formal and informal work in western economies and beyond, evidence from a study of 350 households in rural England is here reported. The finding is that although each and every theorization is wholly valid in relation to particular populations engaged in specific types of informal work, no one theorization fully captures the diverse and multiple relationships between formal and informal work. Here, in consequence, it is contended that only by using all of the <b>existing</b> <b>theorizations</b> will a finer-grained and more comprehensive understanding of the complex and multifarious relationships between formal and informal work be achieved. The result is a call to move beyond the conventional sim-plistic belief that the formal economy is everywhere replacing {{the informal}} economy and for greater recognition of the multifarious relations between formal and informal work in contemporary economies...|$|R
40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} this paper is to examine the current gap <b>existing</b> between ethics <b>theorization</b> and {{enforcement}} in the Nigerian leadership system. Design/methodology/approach – In an attempt to achieve the objective of the paper, some ethical issues in the Nigerian governance and the several regulatory and enforcement agencies set up to curb ethical menace were critically examined. The achievements of the bodies were also evaluated. Findings – The paper concludes that the apparent gap which continues to exist is not a function of ethical definition but results from challenges in the enforcement which are thematically grouped under leadership, societal and individual variables. Research limitations/implications – The analysis suggests that bridging the ethical gap in Nigeria depends largely on leadership which must be by example. Originality/value – This paper presents an invaluable challenge to leadership in Nigeria who must reposition their responsibility. Business ethics, Ethics, Governance, Leadership, Nigeria...|$|R
40|$|What do fashion {{designers}} {{do when they}} do fashion? How are enchanting clothing objects stitched and pieced together behind closed doors? What happens when a designer is not performing on dazzling front stages according to certain culturally determined expectations, norms or embodied scripts? We are easily seduced by the exciting surface, fantasy and magic of fashion (e. g. Evans, 2001; Moeran, 2015; Soley-Beltran, 2012; Thrift, 2008). In fact, popular readings about fashion tend to emphasize its references to consumer dreams, seduction, spectatorship and glamour (Moeran, 2015; Stacey, 1994). Meanwhile, we know less about the mundane work practices and emerging activities of (high) fashion. This thesis explores what happens in and during fashion organizing, in the broadest sense. Written {{at the intersection of}} fashion studies and organization studies, this thesis focuses on the demystification, deepening and appreciation of ordinary fashion practice and its ‘nitty-gritty-details’ (Chia, 2004, 29). Previous work on fashion has rarely paid detailed attention to the micro-level activities through which fashion’s daily organizing emerges and happens. As such, this thesis is in contrast to much of the <b>existing</b> <b>theorizations</b> of fashion that have, to a great extent, focused on ‘still’ surface, pleasure and consumption, to the degree that messy socio-material organization, embodied action and manual labour have been overshadowed. In this thesis, I open up an intriguing empirical site for the detailed study of bricolage and organizing, phenomena that are always processual, moving, embodied-material and intertwined. Founded on a worldview that emphasizes action, multiplicity and movement (Chia, 1997), this thesis openly asks ‘what goes on in here?’ in order to capture a fashion designer’s multiple ‘here-andnow’ forms of organization. By so doing, this ethnographic study considers the varied actions, ad hoc doings and organizing practices in the affect-intensive day-to-day life of a fashion designer working in the city of Helsinki, a specific cultural context. This piece of writing builds upon previous literature on critical organizational theory (e. g. Dale, 2001; Harding, 2011; Höpfl, 2003; Phillips et al., 2014) that challenges conventional representations of organizing as abstract, disembodied and purposive actions. In my attempt to not fall back on the dualism of materiality–discourse, appearance–reality or the Goffman-esque ‘dichotomy between front-stage and back-stage spaces’ (Shortt, 2015, 655; Satama and Huopalainen, 2016), I highlight the emerging, ‘messy’ and contextual qualities of organizing that have traditionally been overlooked within the field of organization studies in favour of more linear, rational and abstract accounts. In this thesis, I also move physically across a range of fashion’s workspaces as a researcher in order to illustrate glimpses of everyday action and fashion organizing, as these complex activities unfold over time. By closely following a designer inventing and integrating all sorts of resources – often inexpensive and improvisational ones – in order to organize himself and his work across time and space, this thesis offers deep and situated knowledge of the uncertain process of working towards the ideals of polished ‘high’ fashion. This study illustrates a designer and his team navigating complexity by regularly performing the art of bricolage in order to create affection, perfection and value in a context of great expectations, low budgets, surface manipulations, patchworks, exhaustion, and speed. The ongoing organizing in this empirical context includes never-ending capabilities to affect and to be affected, bricolage styles and practices, hard work and intense effort (Thrift, 2010), as well as improvisations, editing tricks and endless changes along the way. Rich in empirical data, this thesis shows how the stitching, sewing or piecing together of ideas, resources and materials – or the inventive manipulation and transformation of various surfaces, bodies and things – matter hugely in fashion. Fashion is essentially in the uncertain process of ‘becoming’. This thesis creates deeper knowledge on the dynamics of organizing (in) a particular hybrid economy that builds upon endless trials-and-errors, surface manipulations and uncertain technologies of enchantment. By shedding light on everyday, exceptional and celebratory actions, this thesis captures the fusion of ‘magical’ and ‘mechanical’ aspects of the fashion organization, and develops fashion as an empirical organizational phenomenon. The close-up empirical engagement with fashion organization can be viewed as one of the key contributions of this thesis. Also, this thesis contributes valuable knowledge about organizing as emerging doings, piecing fragments and performing bricolage, a surprising embodied-material process with no predetermined start or end. Finally, this thesis challenges orthodox understandings of bricolage in the field of organization studies, and develops our understanding of fashion as a multidimensional and unfinished organizational phenomenon. Organizing ‘for’ fashion is essentially unfinished; an ongoing bricolage process of endless becoming where bodies, surfaces and materials intensely intertwine. In this context, substance and surface, image and reality, matter and mind or culture and commerce are never mutually exclusive, but always part of life and, as such, already intensely entangled and intertwined...|$|R
