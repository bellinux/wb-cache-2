40|$|We {{develop a}} model to analyze {{alternative}} health care financing arrangements. Health care is demanded by individuals varying in income and severity of illness. There is a limited supply of health care resources used to treat individuals, causing some individuals to go untreated. We examine outcomes under <b>full</b> public <b>finance,</b> <b>full</b> private <b>finance,</b> and mixed, parallel public and private finance under two rationing rules for the public sector: needs-based rationing and random rationing. Insurers (both public and private) must bid to obtain the necessary health care resources to treat their beneficiaries. While public insurer's ability-to-pay is limited by its (fixed) budget; the private insurers willingness-to-pay reflects the individuals' willingness-to-pay for care. When permitted, the private sector supplies supplementary health care to those {{willing and able to}} pay. We find that the introduction of a private sector diverts treatment from relatively poor to relatively rich individuals. Moreover, if the public system allocates care according to need, then the average severity of the untreated is higher in a mixed system than in a pure public system. While we can unambiguously sign most comparative static effects for a general set of distribution functions, an analysis of the relationship between public sector rationing and the scope for a private health insurance market requires distributional assumptions. For a bivariate uniform distribution function we find that the private health insurance market is smaller when the public sector rations according to need as compared to random allocation of health care. health care financing, rationing rules...|$|R

Aim: The aim of the present study was: to examine the {{relationship between}} the public and the private sector inhealth systems, to review the relevant international experience, and investigate the possibility of implementingprivatizations in the Greek Health System. Conclusions: International experience demonstrates that mass privatization programs can lead to the depreciationof public health systems and also to the conversion of health to a marketable commodity. This can have an impacton the quality of health services, and it can also influence workers’ rights, and increase insurance costs. In Greece,there is a public demand for a public health system, full-scale primary health care services, and the total replanningof hospitals with: <b>full</b> <b>financing,</b> appropriate staffing, and high quality health services for all...|$|E
40|$|Once widely {{considered}} just a theoretical curiosity or an ideological aspiration, employee ownership of enterprise has attracted considerable interest {{in recent years}} as a practical matter of organization. In the West, this interest derives in considerable part from the decline of unionism and the resulting search for other means of assuring efficiency and equity in labor contracting, while in the East, interest in employee ownership has been stimulated by the rapid market-oriented ownership structures that stop short of a direct leap into <b>full</b> <b>finance</b> capitalism. This essay explores the relative efficiency advantages and disadvantages of employee ownership with respect to other forms of ownership [...] in particular, investor ownership [...] and seeks to explain why employee ownership has become widespread in some industries, such as the service professions, while it remains rare in many others. The general conclusion offered is that employee ownership appears relatively efficient in a broad range of circumstances so long as control of the firm can be placed {{in the hands of a}} class of employees who have highly homogeneous interests. Where, however, this condition cannot be met [...] as is commonly the case [...] other forms of ownership typically have the advantage. ...|$|R
