In this paper, we {{concentrate}} {{on the effect of}} migrating Web pages from large screened devices to small screened devices for users who use a Web site first on the larger screen and then use the same site on the small screen. We examine transformation volatility, including cognitive and navigational factors, related to the user experience while switching between devices for Web page use. A user’s cognitive volatility can be minimized by using a transformation method that both enables the user to reuse their existing mental model of a Web page first viewed on the large screen on the small screen and by decreasing the cognitive load required to comprehend the interface components. The navigational volatility relates to a user’s expectation of how to navigate a new instance of a page on a different screen size and is influenced by changes to layout, content, location of options, and legibility. We propose a model for automatic transformation of Web <b>pages</b> called the <b>Gateway</b> that creates reduced replica of the source <b>page.</b> The <b>Gateway</b> transformation model minimizes the effect of transformation volatility for users switching between different screen sizes.

40|$|Summary: The Signaling <b>Gateway</b> Molecule <b>Pages</b> (SGMP) {{database}} provides {{highly structured}} data on proteins which exist in different functional states participating in signal transduction pathways. A molecule page {{starts with a}} state of a native protein, without any modification and/or interactions. New states are formed with every post-translational modification or interaction {{with one or more}} proteins, small molecules or class molecules and with each change in cellular location. State transitions are caused by a combination of one or more modifications, interactions and translocations which then might be associated with one or more biological processes. In a characterized biological state, a molecule can function as one of several entities or their combinations, including channel, receptor, enzyme, transcription factor and transporter. We have also exported SGMP data to the Biological Pathway Exchange (BioPAX) and Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML) as well as in our custom XML.

40|$|There is an {{increasing}} demand for smart fogcomputing gateways as the size of cloud data is growing. This paper presents a Fog computing interface (FIT) for processing clinical speech data. FIT builds upon our previous work on EchoWear, a wearable technology that validated the use of smartwatches for collecting clinical speech data from patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). The fog interface is a low-power embedded system {{that acts as a}} smart interface between the smartwatch and the cloud. It collects, stores, and processes the speech data before sending speech features to secure cloud storage. We developed and validated a working prototype of FIT that enabled remote processing of clinical speech data to get speech clinical features such as loudness, short-time energy, zero-crossing rate, and spectral centroid. We used speech data from six patients with PD in their homes for validating FIT. Our results showed the efficacy of FIT as a Fog interface to translate the clinical speech processing chain (CLIP) from a cloud-based backend to a fog-based smart <b>gateway.</b> Comment: 3 <b>pages,</b> 5 figures, 1 table, 2 nd IEEE International Conference on Smart Computing SMARTCOMP 2016, Missouri, USA, 201...|$|R

[...] Special Issue: PAST Gateways (Palaeo-Arctic Spatial and Temporal <b>Gateways).</b> [...] 16 <b>pages,</b> 12 figures, 2 tables, {{supplementary}} data [URL] is a glacially-carved, E-W trending trough {{located in}} the NW Barents Sea, an epicontinental shelf sea of the Arctic Ocean located off northern Norway and Russia. A set of confined sediment drifts (the “Kveithola Drift”) is {{located in the}} inner part of the trough. In general, drift deposits are commonly characterized by high lateral continuity, restricted occurrence of hiatuses and relatively high accumulation rates, and thus represent excellent repositories of paleo-environmental information. We provide {{for the first time a}} detailed morphological and seismostratigraphic insight into this sediment drift, which is further supported by some preliminary lithological and sedimentological analyses. The complex morphology of the drift, imaged by combining all available multibeam data, includes a main and a minor drift body, two drift lenses in the outer part of the trough, more or less connected drift patches in the innermost part and small perched sediment patches in a structurally-controlled channel to the north. The seismic (PARASOUND) data show that the main and minor drift bodies are mainly well-stratified, characterized by sub-parallel reflections of moderate to high amplitude and good lateral continuity. The reflectors show an abrupt pinch-out on the northern edge where a distinct moat is present, and a gradual tapering to the south. Internally we identify the base of the drift and four internal horizons, which we correlate throughout the drift. Two units display high amplitude reflectors, marked lensoidal character and restricted lateral extent, suggesting the occurrence of more energetic sedimentary conditions. Facies typical for contourite deposition are found in the sediment cores, with strongly bioturbated sediments and abundant silty/sandy mottles that contain shell fragments. These characteristics, along with the morphological and seismic information, suggest a strong control by a bottom current flowing along the moat on the northern edge of the drift. Though both Atlantic and Arctic waters are known to enter the trough, from the west and the north respectively, brine-enriched shelf water (BSW) produced during winter and flowing westward in the moat, is suggested to be responsible for the genesis of the Kveithola Drift. The formation of BSW is inferred to have started around 13 cal ka BP, the onset of drift deposition, suggesting that conditions leading to atmospheric cooling of the surface waters and/or the presence of coastal polynyas and wind or floating ice shelves have persisted on the western Barents Shelf since that time. The units inferred to have been deposited under more energetic sedimentary conditions (tentatively dated to the Younger Dryas and to 8. 9 – 8. 2 cal ka BP) are suggestive of stronger BSW formation. In general, we infer that variations in the bottom current regime were mainly related to BSW formation due to atmospheric changes. They could also have been a response to successive episodes of grounded and sea ice retreat that allowed for a first limited, later open shelf current, which progressively established on the western Barents Sea shelfThe research cruise MSM 30 CORIBAR and this study were partly funded through the MARUM DFG-Research Center/Cluster of Excellence “The Ocean in the Earth System” as part of MARUM project SD- 2.
