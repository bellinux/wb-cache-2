ABSTRACT It is {{not easy}} to build <b>Internet</b> <b>applications</b> with common techniques, such as CGI scripts and Perl. Therefore, we designed the DiCons language, which supports the development of a range of <b>Internet</b> <b>applications</b> at the appropriate level of abstraction. In this paper we discuss the design of DiCons, we give an overview of the tool support and we explain the language by means of an example. 1. INTRODUCTION Some trends concerning the development of new <b>Internet</b> <b>applications</b> can be observed. First of all, the <b>Internet</b> and <b>applications</b> of <b>Internet</b> are developed with a tremendous speed. The first to come with an interesting application sets the standard for that application area.

The Institute promotes climate change denial, advocates for smoker's rights, for the privatization of public resources including school privatization, for school vouchers, for lower taxes and against subsidies and tax credits for individual businesses, and against an expanded federal role in health care, among other issues. In addition to lobbying activities, Heartland hosts an <b>internet</b> <b>application</b> called [...] "Policybot" [...] which serves as a clearinghouse for research from other conservative organizations such as The Heritage Foundation, the American Legislative Exchange Council, and the Cato Institute.|$|E

It was clear that bridging the digital divide was difficult without special expenditure from national budgets. China has not only invested heavily {{in the creation of}} the telecommunication infrastructure, but also the universal telecommunication access in rural and remote areas. To bridge the widening Internet-connection gap between rural and urban areas, China has recently launched the [...] "Every Village has a Phone" [...] and [...] "Gold Farm Engineering" [...] project, which promoted telephone access and <b>Internet</b> <b>application</b> in rural areas. 5,000 networked telephones have been installed in rural areas, and more than 200 agricultural websites have been created. In particular, great efforts have been made to accelerate the construction and improvement of the IT infrastructure to satisfy the socio-economic needs of western regions of the country. China has drawn up a series of favorite policies to encourage the domestic and foreign investors participate in the investment and building of the information industry in the western regions. Moreover, especial efforts have been made by the government to cultivate a number of promising IT industries in the western regions.|$|E
