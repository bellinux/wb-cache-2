5|$|<b>Gone</b> <b>to</b> Coney Island and Booming Business are two 1910 American silent short comedy {{productions}} by the Thanhouser Company. Both {{were released}} {{together on a}} single film reel on July 5, 1910. <b>Gone</b> <b>to</b> Coney Island is a comedy that features Coney Island, which the mere subject would make for a successful film. Booming Business {{may have been the}} very type of slapstick comedy that Edwin Thanhouser specifically said the Thanhouser Company would not produce. The productions of both films have no credits for the cast or crew, but possible candidates for these roles exist. Reviews of the films favored <b>Gone</b> <b>to</b> Coney Island, but some reviewers specifically refused to explain the plot because Coney Island subjects were deemed self-explanatory. Booming Business received one detailed review in The New York Dramatic Mirror which was negative. The films are presumed lost.|$|E

5|$|The Millennium Park {{project has}} been the subject of some {{criticism}} since its inception. In addition to concerns about cost overruns, individuals and organizations have complained that the money spent on the park might have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> other worthy causes, citing poverty in Chicago and problems in the city's schools. Although the park's design and architectural elements have won wide praise, there has been some criticism of its aesthetics. Other criticism has revolved around the larger issue of corruption and political favoritism in the city; The New York Times reported in July 2004 that an inflated contract for park cleanup had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> a company that made large contributions to Mayor Daley's election campaign. The park's only full service restaurant, Park Grill, has been criticized for its connection to numerous friends and associates of the mayor.|$|E

50|$|Between 1842 and 1870 a {{total of}} 525,482 Indians emigrated to the British and French Colonies.

Thus by 1870 the indenture system, transporting Indian labour to the colonies, was an established system of providing labour for European colonial plantations and when, in 1879, Fiji became a recipient of Indian labour it was this same system with a few minor modifications.|$|R

5|$|Although {{initially}} {{planned for}} an East Coast shoot, The Judy Garland Show was taped in Studio 43 at CBS Television City in Los Angeles.

Garland's dressing room was a 110ft × 40ft trailer which had been decorated as a replica of her newly purchased Brentwood home. The corridor that led from her dressing room to the stage was painted to resemble the Yellow Brick Road from The Wizard of Oz.|$|E

40|$|Kratzer (1991) {{discusses}} syntactic {{restrictions on}} the construction of focus alternatives in the sense of Rooth 1992. She presents an example with a focus in the antecedent of a deleted VP. (d 0) Peter: What a copy cat you are! You <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because I did. You <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Elk Lake Lodge because I did. And you <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood because I did. Jane: I only <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD because you did. By reconstructing the deleted VP, Jane´s objection becomes I only <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD because you <b>went</b> <b>to</b> TANGLEWOOD. For this sentence standard alternative semantics al-lows for the construction of an alternative set A 0 which comprises predicates like <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island and <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood, i. e. predicates of the form <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> y. Jane´s objection therefore excludes that she <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Tanglewood because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Block Island. Kratzer claims that this is not intended. The alternative set (A 1) may only comprise predi-cates of the form <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x because Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> x. This restriction is due to syntactic, and not contextual reasons. In constructing an alternative set the focus in a formerly deleted VP must always be replaced by the same value as the corresponding focus in the antecedent VP. Kratzer´s view is widely accepted. We did an experiment to test whether listeners always interpret utterances like Jane´s ac-cording to Kratzer´s hypothesis. We integrated a German analogue of Jane´s objection into two different German dialogues (d 1,d 2). As there is no VP-deletion in German, the German and English examples differ in their anaphoric means. The English example employs VP-deletion, the German ones pronominal anaphora. We placed the dialogues into a context where Peter <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Berlin (resp. Tanglewood), which inspired Jane, who then <b>went</b> <b>to</b> Dort-mund (Block Island), Kiel (Elk Lake Lodge) and Berlin. After she came back, Peter went t...|$|R
