On one hand it is an advantage, be-cause when choosing from more alternatives we can find de-signs that better meet our needs. On another hand {{there is also a}} greater risk to misuse this flexibility and to pro-duce too complicated designs. In this paper we show that there can be different solutions to the same problem de-pending on the assumed <b>design</b> <b>goals.</b> Thus, we shouldn’t speak about the best design, but rather about the best de-sign with respect to the stated design goals; and the success of design largely depends on proper selection of <b>design</b> <b>goals.</b> We believe that the design process could be improved by making goal analysis more explicit. Non-functional require-ments should be specialized up to specific <b>design</b> <b>goals</b> that constrain implementation decisions.

40|$|The {{design of}} an Operating System (OS) {{scheduler}} {{is meant to}} allocate its resources appropriately to all applications. In this paper, we present the scheduling techniques used by two Linux schedulers: O(1) and Completely Fair Scheduler (CFS). CFS is the Linux kernel scheduler that replaces the O(1) scheduler in the 2. 6. 23 kernel. The <b>design</b> <b>goals</b> of CFS are to provide fair CPU resource allocation among executing tasks without sacrificing interactive performance. The ability to achieve good fairness in distributing CPU resource among tasks is important to prevent starvation. However, these <b>design</b> <b>goals</b> have never been scientifically evaluated {{despite the fact that}} there are many conventional operating system benchmarks that are geared towards measuring systems performance in terms of throughput. We therefore scientifically evaluate the <b>design</b> <b>goals</b> of CFS by empirical evaluation. We measure the fairness and interactivity performance by using fairness and interactivity benchmarks. To provide a meaningful representation of results, comparisons of O(1) and CFS kernel schedulers of the open source Linux OS are used. Our experience indicates the CFS does achieve its <b>design</b> <b>goals...</b>|$|R

Most of the previous approaches towards topology control would certainly yield optimal performance for only a small subset of the <b>design</b> <b>goals</b> which are often conflicting in nature. Through both analytical and simulation studies they demonstrate that their protocol is capable of achieving average performance for a variety of topology related parameters simultaneously.|$|R
