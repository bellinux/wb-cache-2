5|$|Adrienne's head {{is split}} open by a {{swinging}} pendulum blade in one death scene, an effect that took several hours to set up. A fake head was created from a model cast of actress Victoria Morsell's head, with pumps installed to pump fake blood into it, and strings attached {{to either side}} {{so it could be}} pulled apart. The crew only had one head model, so they had to keep putting <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> and reusing it over and over for each take. After filming was completed, the crew put the head back together and took a picture of Morsell with it.|$|E
5|$|With {{the vocal}} tracks completed, a final {{mix of the}} album was {{undertaken}} with engineer Dick Meaney at the Church in Crouch End during the autumn of 1991; it was the nineteenth studio in which Loveless had been worked on. The album was edited on an aged machine {{that had previously been}} used to cut together dialog for movies in the 1970s. Its computer threw the entire album out of phase. Shields was able to put <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> from memory, yet when it came to mastering the album, to Creation's dismay, he needed 13 days, rather than the usual one day.|$|E
5|$|In 1997, Matt and Jeff {{created their}} own wrestling promotion, The Organization of Modern Extreme Grappling Arts (frequently {{abbreviated}} to OMEGA Championship Wrestling, or simply OMEGA), in which Matt competed under the name High Voltage. The Hardys launched the promotion because, at the time, there weren't many places to wrestle, nor did they know anyone who could help. Both Matt and Jeff would take apart the ring and put <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> at every event they had, while Matt sewed all the costumes worn in OMEGA. The promotion would fold in October 1999, after both Matt and Jeff signed with the World Wrestling Federation. Eight years later in 2007, Highspots.com produced a two-disc DVD set entitled OMEGA: Uncommon Passion, chronicling {{the history of the}} promotion, including matches and interviews with many OMEGA wrestlers.|$|E

50|$|Legends of the Superheroes is an {{umbrella}} title for two 60-minute live-action television specials produced by Hanna-Barbera that aired on NBC on January 18 and 25, 1979. The series was {{loosely based on}} Hanna-Barbera's Super Friends cartoon show, then airing on Saturday mornings on ABC; but served as a reunion of sorts for the 1960s' Batman TV series, as <b>it</b> brings <b>back</b> <b>together</b> three of its stars reprising their respective roles. The specials were produced like standard variety shows of the time: on videotape and with a laugh track.|$|R
5|$|Ramona, {{published}} in 1884, {{was based in}} part on experiences that Helen Hunt Jackson had had during her visit to Rancho Camulos in 1882. Jackson spent only two hours on the ranch and did not meet Ysabel del Valle, but she had a keen eye for details and used many of her observations in the novel. For example, the altar cloth in the rancho's chapel had a small tear in it which had been mended. In the novel, the character Margarita accidentally tears the altar cloth, and Ramona sews <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together.</b> The book became extremely popular and inspired a great deal of tourism, which was stimulated by the improved access possible due to the opening of Southern Pacific railroad lines in Southern California.|$|E
5|$|Years after Su's death, {{the capital}} city of Kaifeng was besieged and {{captured}} in 1127 by the Jurchens of the Manchuria-based Jin Dynasty during the Jin–Song wars. The clock-tower was dismantled piece by piece by the Jurchens, who carted its components back to their own capital in modern-day Beijing. However, due to the complexity of the tower, they were unable to successfully piece <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together.</b> The new Emperor Gaozong of Song instructed Su's son, Su Xie, to construct a new astronomical clock-tower in its place, and Su Xie set to work studying his father's texts with a team of other experts. However, they were also unsuccessful in creating another clock tower, and Su Xie was convinced that Su Song had purposefully left out essential components in his written work and diagrams so that others would not steal his ideas.|$|E

500|$|Car {{scenes were}} filmed with a [...] "biscuit rig," [...] a camera car rig {{developed}} for the film Seabiscuit (2003), which allowed stunt driver Robert Nagle to steer the car, freeing Gosling to concentrate on acting. Consistent with Refn's usual visual style, wide-angle lenses were used heavily by cinematographer Newton Thomas Sigel, who avoided hand-held camera work. Preferring to keep the film more [...] "grounded" [...] and authentic, he also avoided using of computer-generated imagery (CGI). Budget restrictions were also a factor in this decision. Although many stunt drivers are credited, Gosling did some stunts himself, after completing a stunt driving car crash course. During the production, Gosling re-built the 1973 Chevrolet Malibu used in the film, taking it apart and putting <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together.</b> Filming concluded on November 12, 2010.|$|E

Bayer cut the film into pieces, and soaked it in his bath, applying deliberate fingerprints and abrasions to the footage before putting <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together</b> by hand. Vig would compliment the video for mirroring the band's sound: [...] "some of it looked beautiful, some of it looked distorted, and kinda fucked up - and it sorta described some of our music visually".

They are able to place the last Chaos Emerald in the shrine on the final continent at Eggman's new empire, [...] "Eggmanland", but are interrupted by him; Sonic then defeats Eggman who is using a robot that utilizes Dark Gaia's power.

[...] The women Ash photographed experienced this phenomenon {{in their own}} lives and discussed it with him. Anna served as a chaotic representation of every woman who has a hidden part of herself. Of the 18 photographs in this series, one depicts a bald model who could have passed for a girl or a boy. Her body was broken into many pieces and then <b>it</b> was sewn <b>back</b> <b>together.</b> This beaten state shows the viewer that when she breaks down she has to put herself <b>back</b> <b>together.</b> Another picture entitled [...] "Growing Up" [...] was of a nine year old girl.

It also featured five panels with mannequins ringing gongs or bells, and tablets showing the time of day, or other special times. Furthermore, it featured the first known endless power-transmitting chain drive in horology. Originally built in the capital of Kaifeng, it was dismantled by the Jin army and sent to the capital of Yanjing (now Beijing), where they were unable to put <b>it</b> <b>back</b> <b>together.</b> As a result, Su Song's son Su Xie was ordered to build a replica.|$|E

The Petersen graph is not 3 -edge-colourable, and in 1966 Tutte conjectured that every cubic graph with no cut-edge that does not contain the Petersen graph as a minor is 3 -edge-colourable.
