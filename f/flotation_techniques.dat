Nonetheless, it can be diagnosed in most cases {{by a combination of}} careful questioning, thoracic radiographs, fibre-scope (endoscopic) evaluation of the oesophagus and stomach and special faecal <b>flotation</b> <b>techniques</b> (the standard technique is not usually adequate). In certain circumstances, CT scans of the chest; or exploratory surgery may be used for individual patients. Sometimes, the diagnosis is just a surprise.
