5|$|The <b>greylag</b> <b>goose</b> (Anser anser) was domesticated by the Egyptians {{at least}} 3000 years ago, and a {{different}} wild species, the swan goose (Anser cygnoides), domesticated in Siberia about a thousand years later, {{is known as a}} Chinese goose. The two hybridise with each other and the large knob {{at the base of the}} beak, a noticeable feature of the Chinese goose, is present to a varying extent in these hybrids. The hybrids are fertile and have resulted in several of the modern breeds. Despite their early domestication, geese have never gained the commercial importance of chickens and ducks.|$|E
25|$|Due to {{the fact}} that {{domestic}} geese descended from the <b>Greylag</b> <b>goose</b> are effectively the same species as their wild ancestor (being a subspecies formed through domestication), escaped individuals readily breed with wild populations, resulting in the offspring sometimes resembling either one of their parents, or bearing mixed plumage with patterns of grey and white feathers.|$|E
25|$|The {{karyotype}} of {{the swan}} goose is 2n=80, consisting of four pairs of macrochromosomes, 35 pairs of microchromosomes, {{and a pair}} of sex chromosomes. The two largest macrochromosome pairs as well as the Z (female) chromosome are submetacentric, while the third-largest chromosome pair is acrocentric and the fourth-largest is metacentric. The W chromosomes are acrocentric too, as are the larger microchromosomes, the smaller ones probably being telocentric. Compared to the <b>greylag</b> <b>goose,</b> there seems to have been some rearrangement on the fourth-largest chromosome pair.|$|E

The most important are the tufted duck (Aythya fuligula, red-crested pochard (Netta rufina), mallard (Anas platyrhynchos), <b>greylag</b> <b>goose</b> (Anser anser), pygmy cormorant (Microcarbo pygmeus), purple heron (Ardea purpurea), great white egret (Egretta alba), little egret (Egretta garzetta), eurasian spoonbill(Platalea leucorodia), great white pelican (Pelecanus onocrotalus), Dalmatian pelican (Pelecanus crispus), mute swan (Cygnus olor), and glossy ibis (Plegadis falcinellus).

25|$|In Europe, {{northern}} Africa, {{and western}} Asia, the original domesticated geese {{are derived from}} the <b>greylag</b> <b>goose</b> Anser anser. In eastern Asia, the original domesticated geese are derived from the swan goose Anser cygnoides; these {{are commonly known as}} Chinese geese. Both have been widely introduced in more recent times, and modern flocks in both areas (and elsewhere, such as Australia and North America) may consist of either species, and/or hybrids between them. Chinese geese may be readily distinguished from European geese by the large knob {{at the base of the}} bill, though hybrids may exhibit every degree of variation between them.|$|E

50|$|Anser anser, the <b>greylag</b> <b>goose,</b> is {{a member}} of the {{waterfowl}} family Anatidae. It was first described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 as Anas anser, but was transferred two years later to the new genus Anser, erected by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson, where it is the type species. Two subspecies are recognised; A. a. anser, the western <b>greylag</b> <b>goose,</b> breeds in Iceland and north and central Europe; A. a. rubrirostris, the eastern <b>greylag</b> <b>goose,</b> breeds in Romania, Turkey and Russia eastwards to northeastern China. The two subspecies intergrade where their ranges meet. The <b>greylag</b> <b>goose</b> sometimes hybridises with other species of goose including the barnacle goose (Branta leucopsis) and the Canada goose (Branta canadensis), and occasionally with the mute swan (Cygnus olor). The <b>greylag</b> <b>goose</b> was one of the first animals to be domesticated; this happened at least 3000 years ago in Ancient Egypt, the domestic breed being known as A. a. domesticus. As the domestic goose is a subspecies of the <b>greylag</b> <b>goose</b> they are able to interbreed, with the offspring sharing characteristics of both the wild and tame birds.|$|E

50|$|Since the 1950s, {{increases}} in winter temperatures {{have resulted in}} <b>greylag</b> <b>geese,</b> breeding in central Europe, reducing their winter migration distances.

40|$|Visual co-orientation with another’s gaze {{direction}} (gaze following) {{may provide}} important {{information about the}} location of food, social interactions or predators. Gaze following {{has been shown in}} a variety of mammals, but only in few bird species, and has not been tested in precocial birds at all. It has been suggested that gaze following is an anti-predator behaviour, and in Common ravens (Corvus corax) and rooks (C. frugilegus), it emerges shortly after fledging, at a time when young birds leave the predator-safe nest. However, if gaze following is adaptive, the developmental pattern should differ between altricial and precocial birds. <b>Greylag</b> <b>geese</b> (Anser anser) are highly social birds with a precocial development. Goslings move and feed independently within 24 h post-hatching, and they are highly vulnerable to aerial predators. We therefore predicted that <b>greylag</b> <b>geese</b> are capable of gaze following and that they develop this skill already pre-fledging. We experimentally tested 19 hand-raised greylag goslings for their ability to follow a conspecific’s gaze when they were between 10 days and 6 weeks old. In line with our predictions, first responses were already detectable in 10 -day-old goslings. Our results therefore not only demonstrate that <b>greylag</b> <b>geese</b> follow the gaze of conspecifics into distant space, but that they also develop this ability much earlier than altricial birds...|$|R
