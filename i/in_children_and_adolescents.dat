5|$|At least 41 systems {{measure the}} severity, or grade, of a mild head injury, {{and there is}} little {{agreement}} about which is best. In an effort to simplify, the 2nd International Conference on Concussion in Sport, meeting in Prague in 2004, decided that these systems should be abandoned in favor of a 'simple' or 'complex' classification. However, the 2008 meeting in Zurich abandoned the simple versus complex terminology, although the participants did agree to keep the concept that most (80–90%) concussions resolve in a short period (7–10 days), and although the recovery time frame may be longer <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents.</b>|$|E
5|$|Suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors are rare in clinical trials, and the FDA requires all antidepressants, including bupropion, {{to carry a}} boxed warning stating that antidepressants may {{increase the risk of}} suicide in persons younger than 25. This warning is based on a statistical analysis conducted by the FDA which found a 2-fold increase in suicidal thought and behavior <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> and 1.5-fold increase in the 18–24 age group. For this analysis the FDA combined the results of 295 trials of 11 antidepressants in order to obtain statistically significant results. Considered in isolation, bupropion was not statistically different from placebo.|$|E
5|$|The healthy BMI range {{varies with}} the age and sex of the child. Obesity <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents</b> {{is defined as a}} BMI greater than the 95thpercentile. The {{reference}} data that these percentiles are based on is from 1963 to 1994 and thus has not been affected by the recent increases in rates of obesity. Childhood obesity has reached epidemic proportions in the 21stcentury, with rising rates in both the developed and the developing world. Rates of obesity in Canadian boys have increased from 11% in the 1980s to over 30% in the 1990s, while during this same time period rates increased from 4 to 14% in Brazilian children.|$|E

5|$|Despite {{being the}} most {{commonly}} studied and diagnosed mental disorder <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> the exact cause is unknown {{in the majority of}} cases. It affects about 5–7% of children when diagnosed via the DSM-IV criteria and 1–2% when diagnosed via the ICD-10 criteria. As of 2015 it is estimated to affect about 51.1 million people. Rates are similar between countries and depend mostly on how it is diagnosed. ADHD is diagnosed approximately three times more often in boys than in girls, although the disorder is often overlooked in girls due to their symptoms differing from those of boys. About 30–50% of people diagnosed in childhood continue to have symptoms into adulthood and between 2–5% of adults have the condition.|$|E
5|$|Externalizing {{disorders}} (i.e., acting-out disorders) show {{a clearer}} link to delayed gratification, since they more directly involve deficits in impulse control. For example, {{attention deficit hyperactivity}} disorder (ADHD) and aggressive behavior are associated with difficulty delaying gratification <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents,</b> as are substance abuse, gambling, and other addictive behaviors in adolescents and adults. In a 2010 study, teenagers and young adults with stronger abilities to delay gratification were less likely to drink alcohol, or to smoke cigarettes or cannabis. Interestingly, a 2011 study found that the contrast in delayed gratification between children with and without ADHD was no longer significant after statistically controlling for IQ (in other words, ADHD was not associated with delayed gratification above and beyond the influence of IQ). This may stem from the high correlation between intelligence and delayed gratification, and suggests that the tie between delayed gratification and ADHD could benefit from more investigation.|$|E
5|$|There is no {{well-established}} {{treatment for}} self-injurious behaviour in children or adolescents. Cognitive behavioural therapy {{may also be}} used to assist those with Axis I diagnoses, such as depression, schizophrenia, and bipolar disorder. Dialectical behaviour therapy (DBT) can be successful for those individuals exhibiting a personality disorder, and could potentially be used for those with other mental disorders who exhibit self-harming behaviour. Diagnosis and treatment of the causes of self-harm is thought {{by many to be the}} best approach to treating self-harm. But in some cases, particularly in people with a personality disorder, this is not very effective, so more clinicians are starting to take a DBT approach in order to reduce the behaviour itself. People who rely on habitual self-harm are sometimes hospitalised, based on their stability, their ability and especially their willingness to get help. In adolescents multisystem therapy shows promise. Treatments such as CBT, family intervention, interpersonal therapy, and various psychodynamic therapies were all shown to be possibly effective in treating self-injurious behaviour <b>in</b> <b>children</b> <b>and</b> <b>adolescents.</b>|$|E
