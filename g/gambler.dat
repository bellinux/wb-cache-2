40|$|The study {{aimed to}} {{identify}} different patterns of gambling activities (PGAs) and to investigate how PGAs differed in gambling problems, substance use outcomes, personality traits and coping strategies. A {{representative sample of}} 4989 young Swiss males completed a questionnaire assessing seven distinct gambling activities, gambling problems, substance use outcomes, personality traits and coping strategies. PGAs were identified using latent class analysis (LCA). Differences between PGAs in gambling and substance use outcomes, personality traits and coping strategies were tested. LCA identified six different PGAs. With regard to gambling and substance use outcomes, the three most problematic PGAs were extensive <b>gamblers,</b> followed by private <b>gamblers,</b> and electronic lottery and casino <b>gamblers,</b> respectively. By contrast, the three least detrimental PGAs were rare or non-gamblers, lottery only <b>gamblers</b> and casino <b>gamblers.</b> With regard to personality traits, compared with rare or non-gamblers, private and casino <b>gamblers</b> {{reported higher levels of}} sensation seeking. Electronic lottery and casino <b>gamblers,</b> private <b>gamblers</b> and extensive <b>gamblers</b> had higher levels of aggression-hostility. Extensive and casino <b>gamblers</b> reported higher levels of sociability, whereas casino <b>gamblers</b> reported lower levels of anxiety-neuroticism. Extensive <b>gamblers</b> used more maladaptive and less adaptive coping strategies than other groups. Results suggest that gambling is not a homogeneous activity since different types of <b>gamblers</b> exist according to the PGA they are engaged in. Extensive <b>gamblers,</b> electronic and casino <b>gamblers</b> and private <b>gamblers</b> may have the most problematic PGAs. Personality traits and coping skills may predispose individuals to PGAs associated with more or less negative outcomes...|$|R

40|$|Numerous {{studies have}} {{reported}} higher rates of gambling problems among Internet compared with non-Internet <b>gamblers.</b> However, little research has examined those at risk of developing gambling problems or overall gambling involvement. This study aimed to examine differences between problem and moderate-risk <b>gamblers</b> among Internet and non-Internet <b>gamblers</b> to determine the mechanisms for how Internet gambling may contribute to gambling problems. Australian <b>gamblers</b> (N = 6, 682) completed an online survey that included measures of gambling participation, problem gambling severity, and help seeking. Compared with non-Internet <b>gamblers,</b> Internet <b>gamblers</b> were younger, engaged in {{a greater number of}} gambling activities, and were more likely to bet on sports. These differences were significantly greater for problem than moderate-risk <b>gamblers.</b> Non-Internet <b>gamblers</b> were more likely to gamble on electronic gaming machines, and a significantly higher proportion of problem <b>gamblers</b> participated in this gambling activity. Non-Internet <b>gamblers</b> {{were more likely to report}} health and psychological impacts of problem gambling and having sought help for gambling problems. Internet <b>gamblers</b> who experience gambling-related harms appear to represent a somewhat different group from non-Internet problem and moderate-risk <b>gamblers.</b> This has implications for the development of treatment and prevention programs, which are often based on research that does not cater for differences between subgroups of <b>gamblers...</b>|$|R

40|$|This paper investigates {{consumer}} {{perspectives of}} implemented and proposed gambling harm minimisation measures {{taken from a}} geographically stratified survey of adult residents in Tasmania, Australia. Electronic gaming machine (EGM) <b>gamblers</b> were asked whether current and proposed EGM harm minimisation measures impacted on their actual or anticipated gambling expenditure and enjoyment. Participants were analysed based on their endorsement of Problem Gambling Severity Index criteria (scores 0 – 27), and categorised as non-problem <b>gamblers</b> (score 0), low-risk <b>gamblers</b> (scores 1 – 2), and moderate/problem <b>gamblers</b> (scores 3 +). Specifically, we wanted to identify harm minimisation policies {{that resulted in the}} lowest decreases in enjoyment for non-problem <b>gamblers</b> and the highest decreases in expenditure for moderate/problem <b>gamblers.</b> Regarding current policies, the lowest decrease in enjoyment for non-problem <b>gamblers</b> was the ban on Automatic Teller Machines (ATMs) in EGM venues (0. 2 %) while the highest decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem <b>gamblers</b> was the reduction in maximum lines (46. 9 %). For the proposed measures, the lowest decrease in enjoyment for non-problem <b>gamblers</b> was visible clocks (1. 2 %) while the highest decrease in expenditure for moderate/problem <b>gamblers</b> was reducing cash withdrawals (36. 3 %). These results suggest universal EGM harm minimisation measures can differentially target non-problem and moderate/problem <b>gamblers...</b>|$|R
