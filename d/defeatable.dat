25|$|The Battle of the Catalaunian Plains {{is given}} its first modern {{historical}} perspective by Edward Gibbon, who {{called it the}} last victory achieved {{in the name of}} the Western Roman Empire. Gibbon noted that it was from his enemies we hear of his terrible deeds, not from friendly chroniclers, emphasizing that the former had no reason to elevate Attila's reign of terror, but of proving Attila to be <b>defeatable.</b> The first individual historical survey of the battle was given by Sir Edward Creasy, who heralded it as a triumph of the Christian Europe over the pagan savages of Asia, saving classical heritage and European culture.|$|E
500|$|Executive {{producer}} Steven Moffat {{announced in}} 2011 {{that he intended}} to give a [...] "rest" [...] to the Daleks. The reason for the rest was that Moffat felt their frequent appearances made them the [...] "most reliably <b>defeatable</b> enemies in the universe". Moffat recalled that the Daleks were remembered for being scary, but due to their legacy as British icons they had become [...] "cuddly" [...] over the years and their true menace forgotten; with [...] "Asylum" [...] he intended to make them scary again, reminding the audience of their intentions. He thought {{the best way to do}} this would be to show Daleks that were considered even madder than usual. Gillan admitted that she had not been scared of the Daleks before working on the episode. It is also the first Dalek story Moffat has written for the show; he stated that he [...] "couldn't resist" [...] the opportunity.|$|E
2500|$|The sixth {{series was}} {{commissioned}} in March 2010, before the fifth series aired. Neither Peter Bennett or Tracie Simpson returned as producers, with Sanne Wohlenberg covering the {{role for the}} [...] "A Christmas Carol" [...] and the first two episodes filmed for the main series ("The Doctor's Wife" [...] and [...] "Night Terrors"). Marcus Wilson produced every other episode except [...] "Closing Time", where Denise Paul produces and Wilson is credited as [...] "series producer". Production designer Edward Thomas was replaced by Michael Pickwoad. Lead writer and executive producer Steven Moffat stated {{that the purpose of}} the previous series was to [...] "reassure" [...] the audience that the show was the same, despite the many production changes. However, he wanted this series to be more of a [...] "ghost train" [...] and [...] "worry" [...] the audience. The series is much more serialised than previous ones; the arc-driven nature was inspired by positive reactions from fans when the Doctor from the fifth series finale [...] "The Big Bang" [...] appeared in the earlier episode [...] "Flesh and Stone". Moffat decided to [...] "rest" [...] the Doctor's arch-enemies the Daleks for the series, as being the [...] "most frequent" [...] enemies of the show made them [...] "the most reliably <b>defeatable</b> enemies in the universe".|$|E
2500|$|The Daleks only {{appeared}} {{briefly in}} subsequent finales [...] "The Pandorica Opens"/"The Big Bang" [...] (2010) and The Wedding of River Song (2011) as Steven Moffat decided to [...] "give them a rest" [...] and stated [...] "There's {{a problem with}} the Daleks. They are the most famous of the Doctor's adversaries and the most frequent, which means they are the most reliably <b>defeatable</b> enemies in the universe." [...] They next appear in [...] "Asylum of the Daleks" [...] (2012), where the Daleks are shown to have greatly increased numbers and have a Parliament; in addition to the traditional [...] "modern" [...] Daleks, several designs from both the original and new series appear. All record of the Doctor is removed from their collective consciousness {{at the end of the}} episode. The Daleks then appear in the 50th Anniversary special [...] "The Day of the Doctor", where they are seen being defeated in the Time War. In [...] "The Time of the Doctor", the Daleks are one of the races that travel to Trenzalore and besiege it for centuries to stop the Doctor from releasing the Time Lords. Due to converting Tasha Lem into a Dalek puppet, they regain knowledge of the Doctor. In the end, they are the only enemy left, the others having retreated or been destroyed and nearly kill the near-death Doctor before the Time Lords intervene and grant him a new regeneration cycle. The Doctor then uses his regeneration energy to obliterate the Daleks on the planet.|$|E

5000|$|The Tomb of the High Priest: At first, {{it seems}} {{just to be}} an empty room, but if José moves a wall, a {{sarcophagus}} is found in a hidden room. Scorper is found here. (Scorper is usually the first <b>defeatable</b> monster.) ...|$|E
50|$|Warrior parties usually {{encounter}} Monsters of {{the same}} level as themselves. This is necessary, for Warriors can find higher-level Monsters very difficult or even impossible to destroy. For example, a level 10 Great Unclean One would rampage through a party of level 5 Warriors and would not be remotely <b>defeatable.</b>|$|E
5000|$|A {{voting system}} {{complying}} with the Condorcet loser criterion will never allow a Condorcet loser to win. A Condorcet loser is a candidate who can be defeated in a head-to-head competition against each other candidate. (Not all elections will have a Condorcet loser since {{it is possible for}} three or more candidates to be mutually <b>defeatable</b> in different head-to-head competitions.) ...|$|E
5000|$|In some cases, {{corporate}} interests and political groups {{have found it}} useful to create policy institutes, advocacy organizations, and think tanks. For example, The Advancement of Sound Science Coalition was formed in the mid-1990s to dispute research finding an association between second-hand smoke and cancer. According to an internal memorandum from Philip Morris Companies referring to the United States Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), [...] "The credibility of the EPA is <b>defeatable,</b> {{but not on the}} basis of ETS environmental tobacco smoke alone,... It must be part of a larger mosaic that concentrates all the EPA's enemies against it at one time." ...|$|E
5000|$|Klonoa: Door to Phantomile is a side-scrolling {{platform}} game {{viewed from}} a [...] "2.5D" [...] perspective. The player moves the protagonist, Klonoa, along a path in a two-dimensional fashion, {{but the game}} is rendered in three dimensions. This allows the path followed to curve and for the player to interact with objects outside of the path. The game is divided into levels called [...] "Visions", where the player progresses by following a path with <b>defeatable</b> computer-controlled enemies and puzzles that must be solved. At the end of some levels, the player must defeat a boss - a powerful enemy.|$|E

50|$|Initially the pickups were Gibsons, rewired as 4 {{conductor}} and potted. Later Guild pickups {{were treated}} the same way. In 1974-1975, some custom guitar models, and from 1975-1982, many production bass guitars were fitted with innovative, adjustable-pole humbucker pickups, designed by Sergio Zuñica of Pacific Palisades, California. In 1975 DiMarzio agreed to build wax-potted, 4-conductor pickups for B.C. Rich and they were used until B.C. Rich began designing their own in the late 1980s. Early in the 1970s Neal Moser was brought on board to design and supervise the electronics. His contribution was a setup with coil taps, a phase switch, a Varitone and a <b>defeatable</b> active preamp (or two in some models). This electronics package {{continues to this day}} on higher-end models.|$|E

50|$|Residual {{high-frequency}} {{components of}} the signal remaining after de-multiplexing can be problematic when recording to analog magnetic media. While the higher frequencies are unlikely to survive filtering in the recording deck, the 19 kHz tone is within the 20 to 20,000 Hz frequency range for many tape formats, including compact cassette, and typically provides an audible beat (difference) tone {{in conjunction with the}} tape head bias signal used when recording. The recording may also be saturated by the pilot tone. More importantly, the pilot tone interferes with the proper functioning of noise reduction systems such as Dolby B, C and S. Because the pilot tone is relatively loud in comparison to the overall loudness of the FM program (typically -20dB), the source signal is not correctly processed by the noise reduction system, leading to audible artefacts such as breathing and pumping. For this reason many decks with <b>defeatable</b> MPX filters have been designed {{in such a way that}} the MPX filter can only be enabled when also a noise reduction system is enabled.|$|E
5000|$|In 439, when Emperor Taiwu {{was on a}} {{campaign}} to conquer Northern Liang, he had Crown Prince Huang assume imperial authority at the capital Pingcheng (平城, in modern Datong, Shanxi), assisted by the high-ranking official Qiumuling Shou (丘穆陵壽), to guard against a Rouran attack. However, Qiumuling, not believing that Rouran would actually attack, took little actual precautions, and when Rouran's Chilian Khan Yujiulü Wuti attacked, Pingcheng was caught nearly defenseless. Qiumuling wanted to escort Crown Prince Huang to the hills south of Pingcheng and take up defense position there, but at the opposition of Emperor Taiwu's wet nurse Empress Dowager Dou, Crown Prince Huang remained in Pingcheng, and when Northern Wei forces subsequently defeated Rouran forces, Yujiulü Wuti was forced to withdraw. (By this point, although he was only 11, Crown Prince Huang was apparently already participating in major military and policy decisions, as he had opposed his father's Northern Liang campaign, but was overruled by his father, who trusted Cui Hao's advice that Northern Liang was easily <b>defeatable.)</b> ...|$|E

5000|$|It {{was said}} that, after Liu's conquest of Yichang, he {{believed}} himself to have divine help, and became both licentious and cruel. His methods of torture included putting people in iron cages and then heating the cages, and brushing their faces with iron brushes. [...] Against Sun's advice, he {{also began to}} have designs to take imperial title. He first {{sent a letter to}} Wang Rong and Wang Chuzhi, asking them to support him to take the title of Shangfu (尚父, [...] "imperial father," [...] a very honorary title rarely given and only given to the most senior officials). When Wang Rong informed Li of this, Li initially wanted to attack Liu right away, but the Jin generals believed that offering Liu the title would make him even more arrogant and more <b>defeatable.</b> Li thus signed a joint petition with Wang Rong, Wang Chuzhi, and three other governors under Li's command—Zhou Dewei the military governor of Zhenwu Circuit (振武, headquartered in modern Datong, Shanxi), Li Sizhao the military governor of Zhaoyi Circuit (昭義, headquartered in modern Changzhi, Shanxi), and Song Yao (宋瑤) the defender of Tiande Circuit (天德, headquartered in modern Hohhot, Inner Mongolia)—offering Liu the Shangfu title. Liu then submitted their petition to Emperor Taizu, stating to Emperor Taizu if Emperor Taizu made him the supreme commander of the circuits to the north, Li Cunxu and Wang Rong would fall into line. Emperor Taizu, while knowing that Liu was inflating himself, thereafter sent the emissaries Wang Tong (王瞳) and Shi Yanqun (史彥群) to bestow him the title of surveyor (采訪使, Caifangshi) of the circuits north of the Yellow River.|$|E
40|$|In what follows, I take naturalism to be a methodological {{prescription}} {{about how}} philosophical theories should relate to other branches of enquiry. Methodological naturalists urge that philosophical claims should a) be informed and {{constrained by the}} best scientific and empirical knowledge and b) should eschew claims about sources of information not so informed or constrained. In a naturalized discipline the arrows of justification and constraint between claims and theories are reciprocal. Theories in a naturalized philosophy of mind, for example, are informed by developments in psychology, neuroscience and AI but also inform research in those areas. The claim that phenomenology should be naturalised is normative. It urges phenomenologist to adopt a naturalistic attitude to phenomenology. However, it is not fact proof. It is justified {{if and only if}} natural scientific claims are relevant to arbitrating between phenomenological claims. Thus phenomenology would be apt for naturalization if its claims were <b>defeatable</b> or required supplementation by claims made in other areas of science or naturalisti...|$|E
40|$|For {{many years}} now, {{philosophical}} naturalism has enjoyed {{the status of}} orthodoxy in the Western academy; and it is widely recognized among theists {{as one of the}} most important sources of opposition to belief in God. In World Without Design: The Ontological Consequences of Naturalism, I raised two main objections against naturalism. First, I argued that there is an important sense in which naturalism’s status as orthodoxy is without ratio-nal foundation. Second, I argued that naturalists must give up two views that many of them are inclined to hold dear—realism about material objects (RMO) and materialism. I also argued that naturalists will have a difficult time avoiding solipsism. If I am right, naturalism comes with some very unattractive commitments. In a review recently published in Faith and Philosophy, Dale Jacquette rais-es several objections against my book, ultimately concluding that its argu-ments are “myopic[ally] focus[ed] on easily, if not succinctly, <b>defeatable</b> strawmen. ” Moreover, as Jacquette sees it, once I have conquered my army of strawmen (2004 : 127), I “still [leave] the strongest contrary and sometimes most obvious opposing views untouched. ” (2004 : 127) Indeed, he alleges that I overlook at least one formulation of naturalism that straightforwardly “answers [my] main objections to naturalism. ” (2004 : 127) These are serious charges. If true, they make it difficult to resist his final verdict—that the book is “hard to recommend on its philosophical merits. ” (2004 : 130) The question, however, is whether any of these charges are backed up by anything even approaching decent argument. In what follows, I will show that they are not. Given the serious nature of the charges, one woul...|$|E
