50|$|A further {{feature of}} the {{structure}} of negative coronas is that as the <b>electrons</b> <b>drift</b> outwards, they encounter neutral molecules and, with electronegative molecules (such as oxygen and water vapor), combine to produce negative ions.

50|$|Usually, the <b>electron</b> <b>drift</b> {{velocity}} in {{a material}} is {{directly proportional to}} the electric field, {{which means that the}} electron mobility is a constant (independent of electric field).

50|$|Initial {{observations}} by fast {{camera imaging}} in 2008 were recorded independently, demonstrated with better precision, and confirmed demonstrating that most ionization processes occur in spatially very limited ionization zones.

50|$|In the 1960s, Hurst {{along with}} L.B. O'Kelly, E.B. Wagner, J.A. Stockdale, James E. Parks, and F.J. Davis {{investigated}} time-of-flight electron transport in gases.

Hurst led efforts to investigate time-of-flight of electron transport in atomic and molecular gases.|$|E
50|$|The drift {{velocity}} {{deals with the}} average velocity of a particle, such as an electron, due to an electric field. In general, an electron will propagate randomly in a conductor at the Fermi velocity. Free electrons in a conductor follow a random path. Without {{the presence of an}} electric field, the electrons have no net velocity. When a DC voltage is applied, the <b>electron</b> <b>drift</b> velocity will increase in speed proportionally to the strength of the electric field. The {{drift velocity}} is on the order of millimeters per hour. AC voltages cause no net movement; the electrons oscillate back and forth in response to the alternating electric field (over a distance of a few micrometers - see example calculation).|$|E

50|$|In 1820, André-Marie Ampère {{showed that}} {{parallel}} wires having currents {{in the same}} direction attract one another. To the electrons, the wire contracts slightly, causing the protons of the opposite wire to be locally denser. As the electrons in the opposite wire are moving as well, they do not contract (as much). This results in an apparent local imbalance between electrons and protons; the moving electrons in one wire are attracted to the extra protons in the other. The reverse can also be considered. To the static proton's frame of reference, the electrons are moving and contracted, resulting in the same imbalance. The <b>electron</b> <b>drift</b> velocity is relatively very slow, on the order of a meter an hour but the force between an electron and proton is so enormous that even at this very slow speed the relativistic contraction causes significant effects.|$|E
50|$|HEMTs' {{exceptional}} {{carrier mobility}} and switching speed {{come from the}} following conditions. The wide band element is doped with donor atoms; thus it has excess electrons in its conduction band. These electrons will diffuse to the adjacent narrow band material’s conduction band due to the availability of states with lower energy. The movement of electrons will cause a change in potential and thus an electric field between the materials. The electric field will push electrons back to the wide band element’s conduction band. The diffusion process continues until electron diffusion and <b>electron</b> <b>drift</b> balance each other, creating a junction at equilibrium similar to a p-n junction. Note that the undoped narrow band gap material now has excess majority charge carriers. The fact that the charge carriers are majority carriers yields high switching speeds, {{and the fact that}} the low band gap semiconductor is undoped means that there are no donor atoms to cause scattering and thus yields high mobility.|$|E
5000|$|When the Hall probe is held so {{that the}} {{magnetic}} field lines are passing at right angles through the sensor of the probe, the meter gives {{a reading of the}} value of magnetic flux density (B). A current is passed through the crystal which, when placed in a magnetic field has a [...] "Hall effect" [...] voltage developed across it. The Hall effect is seen when a conductor is passed through a uniform magnetic field. The natural <b>electron</b> <b>drift</b> of the charge carriers causes the magnetic field to apply a Lorentz force (the force exerted on a charged particle in an electromagnetic field) to these charge carriers. The result is what is seen as a charge separation, with a buildup of either positive or negative charges on the bottom or {{on the top of the}} plate. The crystal measures 5 mm square. The probe handle, being made of a non-ferrous material, has no disturbing effect on the field.|$|E

50|$|On {{the side}} {{opposite}} of the cathode plane {{is a set of}} anode wire planes set at potentials much higher (less negative) than that of the cathode. Each plane is separated from its neighbors by a small gap, usually on the order of 1 cm. A plane consists of many parallel conducting wires spaced by a few millimeters, and the angle at which the wires are oriented relative to the vertical varies from plane to plane. Together, these planes read out signals from the drift electrons. For a detector with N anode wire planes, the inner N − 1 planes are called induction planes. These are set at lower (more negative) potentials than the outer plane, allowing drift electrons to pass through them, inducing signals that are used for event reconstruction. The outer plane is called the collection plane because the drift electrons are collected on these wires, producing additional signals. Having multiple planes with different wire orientations permits two-dimensional event reconstruction, while the third dimension is found from <b>electron</b> <b>drift</b> times.|$|E
50|$|A light-collection system often {{accompanies the}} basic LArTPC {{as a means}} of extracting more {{information}} from an event by scintillation light. It can also {{play an important role in}} triggering, because it collects scintillation light only nanoseconds after the particle passes through the detector. This is comparatively (on the order of 1000 times) shorter than the time taken by the freed electrons to drift to the wire planes, so it is often sufficient to demarcate the collection time of scintillation photons as a trigger time (t0) for an event. With this trigger time, one can then find <b>electron</b> <b>drift</b> times, which enables three-dimensional reconstruction of an event. While such systems are not the only means by which a LArTPC can identify a trigger time, they are necessary for studying phenomena like supernovae and proton decay, where the particles undergoing decay or interaction are not produced in a human-made accelerator and the timing of a beam of particles is therefore not known. Photomultiplier tubes, light guides, and silicon photomultipliers are examples of instruments used to collect this light. These are typically positioned just outside the drift volume.|$|E

The wave fronts have small angles with the magnetic fie]d lines and propagate from the high-stream region to the low-stream region. ...|$|R
40|$|Three-dimensional track {{reconstruction}} is a {{key issue}} for directional Dark Matter detection. It requires a precise knowledge of the <b>electron</b> <b>drift</b> velocity.

The latter can exceed the ion-acoustic speed and is probably a measure of the <b>electron</b> <b>drift</b> velocity.
