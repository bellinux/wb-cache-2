5000|$|Keiō {{was among}} the first railway {{companies}} <b>to</b> introduce <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> on its trains. <b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> are those reserved for the physically handicapped, elderly, pregnant women, and people with infants. These special seats, which were initially called [...] "Silver seats" [...] but renamed in 1993, were inaugurated on Respect for the Aged Day on September 15, 1973.|$|R
5000|$|After {{the setup}} of <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> in MTR, bus {{companies}} started <b>to</b> follow. <b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> were introduced <b>to</b> the Kowloon Motor Bus (KMB) in May 2011, and then followed by Citybus and New World First Bus (NWFB) in June 2012. In {{accordance with the}} press releases, the KMB first introduced <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> 87 of their buses. In each bus, several <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> were located {{at the front of}} the lower deck. The headrests of such seats are in green with words of [...] "PRIORITY SEAT" [...] and symbols of elderly, handicapped, pregnant women, and people with infants or young children to help passengers identify them. Advertisements were also broadcast in order to raise the awareness of passengers to offer seats. Receiving positive and supportive feedback after the 6-month trial, in the year 2012, the KMB decided <b>to</b> have <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> set up in all of its buses and the headrests of such seats were changed into dark purple. According to press releases from the government, for the minibus, <b>priority</b> <b>seat</b> is provided at the first single seat near the door. And for the tram, there are a few <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> offered near the driver in the lower deck. Also, there is <b>priority</b> <b>seating</b> offered by the Cathay Pacific airline, for passengers with disabilities. But since other transportations such as taxi and ferry which usually do not allow standing, there are no specifically designated <b>priority</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
50|$|Other {{improvements}} included wider {{entry and}} exit doorways, flip-up seats for {{the installation of}} wheelchair positions (which are now marked in blue velour <b>to</b> signify <b>priority</b> <b>seating</b> areas instead of the red velour used for other seats), {{and the removal of}} vertical stanchions along the car's centre line, making them the TTC's first subway cars to be wheelchair-accessible. The interior colour scheme consists of grey floors and walls and dark red doors and panels, unlike the simulated woodgrain panels used on the predecessor H-series cars.|$|R
50|$|The {{game was}} {{announced}} as a sellout on July 21, 2011, thirty {{days after the}} tickets went on sale {{to the public and}} 129 before the game itself. This surpassed the previous Vancouver record, set when the 93rd Grey Cup game was sold out on October 7, 2005. The sellout attendance for the 99th Grey Cup was 54,313. Prices ranged from $125 to $375 when tickets were released to the general public in June 2011, but 2011 Lions season ticket holders were able <b>to</b> get <b>priority</b> <b>seating</b> at prices ranging from $100 to $295.|$|R
5000|$|Under the {{principle}} of [...] "Barrier Free Environment", the idea of [...] "priority seats" [...] was first introduced in northern Europe. Providing unimpeded, effortless access and ideal living environment to all people is the final goal. Over the past centuries, the idea of <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> spread <b>to</b> Asian countries such as Japan, Taiwan and Korea. These three are the most significant examples due to their cultural emphasis on politeness that teaches the younger generation to offer seats to the elderly. Failing {{to do so would}} be regarded as disrespectful. Countries such as Australia, Malaysia, Singapore and China have similar traditions. In addition, some countries may require passengers <b>to</b> show their <b>priority</b> <b>seat</b> cards <b>to</b> prove they are eligible, for instance the Southern Railway and National Rail of Britain.|$|R
50|$|In the band's thirtieth anniversary year, 2006, they headlined {{the fifth}} annual Bonnaroo Music and Arts Festival. In {{addition}} to Bonnaroo, Petty was on tour {{throughout the summer}} of 2006. The tour started in Charlotte, North Carolina on June 9 and ended in Randall's Island, Manhattan, New York on August 19. Stops included major cities such as New York, St. Louis, Indianapolis, and Denver. Supporting acts during the tour included Pearl Jam, The Allman Brothers Band, and Trey Anastasio. Additionally, Stevie Nicks joined the band onstage during the first eight concerts as well as subsequent second leg dates to perform various songs from the Heartbreakers' vast catalog. For the Highway Companion Tour they offered a Highway Companion's Club which allowed fans <b>to</b> receive <b>priority</b> <b>seating,</b> discounts at the Tom Petty Store, a complimentary CD of Highway Companion and a personalized email address.|$|R
50|$|On 1 August 2011, Norway's parliament, {{nominally}} {{in recess}} for the summer, reconvened for an extraordinary session to honour {{the victims of}} the attack. In a departure from parliamentary procedure, both King Harald V and Crown Prince Haakon were present. The president of Norway's Parliament, Dag Terje Andersen read out loud the names of all 77 victims. The session was open to the public, but due <b>to</b> limited <b>seating,</b> <b>priority</b> was given <b>to</b> relatives of the deceased.|$|R
50|$|The full-production sets (02 onward) {{incorporate}} {{a number of}} design changes. Whereas in the pre-series set 01, the luggage rack height was generally 1678 mm with a height of 1628 mm in the end cars and in <b>priority</b> <b>seating</b> areas, this is standardized as 1,628 mm throughout from set 02 onward. The <b>handrails</b> next <b>to</b> seats in the full-production sets have an embossed surface compared with the polished metal surface used in the pre-series set.|$|R
50|$|There are {{two major}} controversies {{regarding}} <b>priority</b> <b>seats.</b> First of all, people think that only people in need can sit on the <b>priority</b> <b>seats.</b> Even if the train is full, <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> are still left empty. This situation is common in Taiwan and Hong Kong. People, especially young people, {{are not willing to}} sit on the train as they afraid of being morally criticized, scolded or even cyberbullied (like uploading their scenes of occupying <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> <b>to</b> social networking websites). However, the <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> are first-come-first-served. <b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> are designed <b>to</b> promote the culture of offering seats to the needy. If there are no needy on the public transport, people are free to sit on the <b>priority</b> <b>seats.</b>|$|R
5000|$|<b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> {{have been}} {{designated}} in public transport vehicles by certain transport operators to allow elderly, disabled, {{pregnant women and}} the injured to ride public transport with an equal degree of access and comfort as normal people. <b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> {{can be found on}} various public transportation, including the mass transit railways, buses, minibuses, and trams. The slogan [...] "Please offer your seat to anyone in need" [...] is often displayed beside the seat. The elderly, disabled, pregnant, and injured have <b>priority</b> <b>to</b> take these <b>seats.</b> In most cases, there is no regulation to restrict the use of <b>priority</b> <b>seats,</b> but people are expected to offer their seats to those in need.|$|R
50|$|Improvements to the DVAs (Digital Voice Announcements) with {{differential}} {{pitch of}} the voice allow more natural sounding speech. These announcements were modified in July 2013, and again in January 2014. They have not been modified since then. All the stations included in the stopping pattern are also announced prior to or soon after departure from a terminus stop. ‘Smart’ air-conditioning automatically adjusts to the outside temperature {{and the number of}} passengers on board. Accessibility features include 16 wheelchair spaces, portable wheelchair ramps in the end cars, red fabric on <b>priority</b> <b>seating</b> and additional <b>handrails</b> compared <b>to</b> older trains in the fleet.|$|R
5000|$|In Hong Kong, <b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> {{were first}} {{introduced}} in the MTR in 2009 with the [...] "Priority Seats Campaign".

50|$|The {{number of}} <b>priority</b> <b>seats,</b> {{for the aged}} or infirm, was {{increased}} to 10 seats in each car. The <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> use red moquette and orange straps and poles {{to hold on to}} clarify the distinction between those seats and regular seats. Wheelchair spaces are located behind the driver's cab in both cars on each end of the train.|$|R
50|$|<b>Priority</b> <b>seats</b> motivate people <b>to</b> offer {{seats to}} people with special need. Taking the {{initiative}} to give seats to them can prevent them from accidents when travelling on public transports. According to the Press Release of The Kowloon Motor Bus in 2011, <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> are designed <b>to</b> provide people with special need a safe and enjoyable journey. Such passengers, including the elderly and people with mobility obstacles, may face special inconvenience and difficulties during travelling. Introducing <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> encourages individuals <b>to</b> bear the social responsibility of caring for others in need. According to the Press Release of The Kowloon Motor Bus in 2011, promotion of <b>priority</b> <b>seats</b> aims <b>to</b> enhance the awareness of offering seats to the people with special need so as to cultivate a culture of care. The motion encourages people to be sensitive about other people's needs and take actions of empathy and altruism.|$|R
