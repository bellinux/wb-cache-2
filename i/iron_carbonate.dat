2500|$|From {{the peak}} Spirit spotted a {{striking}} formation, which was dubbed [...] "Home Plate". This {{was an interesting}} target, but Spirit would be driven later to the McCool Hill to tilt its solar panels towards the sun in the coming winter. At the end of October the rover was driven downhill and to Home Plate. On the way down Spirit reached the rock formation named [...] "Comanche" [...] on sol 690. Scientists used data from all three spectrometers {{to find out that}} about one-fourth of the composition of Comanche is magnesium <b>iron</b> <b>carbonate.</b> That concentration is 10 times higher than for any previously identified carbonate in a Martian rock. Carbonates originate in wet, near-neutral conditions but dissolve in acid. The find at Comanche is the first unambiguous evidence from the Mars Exploration Mission rovers for a past Martian environment that may have been more favorable to life than the wet but acidic conditions indicated by the rovers' earlier finds.|$|E

50|$|Badab Soort's {{terraces}} {{are made}} of travertine, a sedimentary rock deposited by flowing water from the two distinct mineral springs; they were formed during Pleistocene and Pliocene geological periods. When the water, supersaturated with calcium carbonate and <b>iron</b> <b>carbonate,</b> reaches the surface, carbon dioxide degases from it, and mineral carbonates are deposited. The depositing continues until the {{carbon dioxide in the}} water balances the carbon dioxide in the air. <b>Iron</b> <b>carbonate</b> and calcium carbonate are deposited by the water as soft jellies, but they eventually harden into travertine.|$|E

40|$|The {{chemical}} {{forms of}} low concentrations of metals (Zn, Pb, Cu, Cd, Co and Mn) and main components (Fe and Ca) were determined under the original reducing conditions of a sulfide-rich sediment from the Gent-Terneuzen Canal (Belgium). Therefore, dissolution experiments {{as a function}} of pH were made in a salt solution mimicking the canal water. The centrifugates remaining after the dissolution vs. pH experiments were subsequently further extracted with 0. 1 M EDTA/ 0. 5 M NaAc (pH 4. 65) to determine eventually readsorbed and/or reprecipitated metal ions. The experimental dissolution vs. pH edge of calcium, iron, manganese and cobalt had a lower slope than theoretically expected {{on the basis of the}} solubility of, respectively, calcium <b>carbonate,</b> <b>iron</b> sulfide/iron <b>carbonate,</b> manganese sulfide/manganese carbonate and cobalt sulfide and was explained by the combination of (a) the solubilities of the various minerals and (b) metal readsorption onto clay minerals and organic matter. Higher metal recoveries were measured in the 0. 1 M EDTA/ 0. 5 M NaAc mixture and proved that in addition coprecipitate formation with <b>iron</b> sulfide/iron <b>carbonate</b> minerals may occur. The solubility of zinc, lead, cadmium and copper was very low in the mimicking salt solution even at very low pH values (up to pH 1) in agreement with the theoretical solubility of their discrete metal sulfides. However, by using an additional 0. 1 M EDTA/ 0. 5 M NaAc extraction on the centrifugates remaining after the dissolution vs. pH experiments, it was qualitatively shown that zinc and lead were partly associated with <b>iron</b> sulfide/iron <b>carbonate</b> phases in the real sediment (in addition to their presence in discrete metal sulfides). Cadmium was present solely in discrete cadmium sulfide phases. It was not possible to verify whether copper was present in discrete copper sulfide phases and/or in mixed coprecipitates with <b>iron</b> sulfide/iron <b>carbonate</b> minerals. status: publishe...|$|R

A chromatographic study shows that uric acid and guanine are not present. The young concretions occur primarily in ergastoplasmic cisternae. They are first wholly electron-opaque, but their center becomes more and more clear. In very old spheres, only a thin shell of electron-opaque material remains.

50|$|Bog ore is a {{renewable}} resource when mined and utilized with care. It is produced when rain water leaches out humic and tannic acids and reacts with carbon dioxide, which is produced {{as a part}} of the natural life-cycle of microorganisms in the soil. Part of this leachate consists of iron particles from deeper in the soil. As the water passes through these areas of loamy soil, also called marl, it deposits a solution of <b>iron</b> <b>carbonate</b> which rises up to the surface. This <b>iron</b> <b>carbonate</b> then combines with the surface soil and, over time, hardens into a solid mass. This process only takes about 25 to 35 years, making it an ideal, almost perpetual resource for industry but only if treated with respect. If the ore bed is left undeveloped and unpolluted, the beds can be mined indefinitely farther south in New Jersey. The operators of furnaces were forced to purchase ore from Staten Island, New York, because the ore beds had been over-mined.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Carbonates</b> (calcium or <b>iron</b> <b>carbonates)</b> were {{discovered}} in a crater {{on the rim of}} Huygens Crater, located in the Iapygia quadrangle. The impact on the rim exposed material that had been dug up from the impact that created Huygens. These minerals represent evidence that Mars once had a thicker carbon dioxide atmosphere with abundant moisture, since these kind of carbonates only form when {{there is a lot of}} water. They were found with the Compact Reconnaissance Imaging Spectrometer for Mars (CRISM) instrument on the Mars Reconnaissance Orbiter. Earlier, the instrument had detected clay minerals. The carbonates were found near the clay minerals. Both of these minerals form in wet environments. [...] It is supposed that billions of years ago Mars was much warmer and wetter. At that time, carbonates would have formed from water and the carbon dioxide-rich atmosphere. Later the deposits of carbonate would have been buried. [...] The double impact has now exposed the minerals. Earth has vast carbonate deposits in the form of limestone.|$|R

5000|$|One of the {{processes}} involved in petrification is permineralization. The fossils created through this process tend to contain {{a large amount of}} the original material of the specimen. This process occurs when groundwater containing dissolved minerals (most commonly quartz, calcite, pyrite, siderite (<b>iron</b> <b>carbonate),</b> and apatite (calcium phosphate) [...] ), fills pore spaces and cavities of specimens, particularly bone, shell or wood. [...] The pores of the organisms' tissues are filled when these minerals precipitate out of the water. Two common types of permineralization are silicification and pyritization.|$|E
5000|$|At low temperature, the {{anaerobic}} corrosion of iron {{can give}} rise {{to the formation of}} [...] "green rust" [...] (fougerite) an unstable layered double hydroxide (LDH). In function of the geochemical conditions prevailing in the environment of the corroding steel, iron(II) hydroxide and green rust can progressively transform in iron(II,III) oxide, or if bicarbonate ions are present in solution, they can also evolve towards more stable carbonate phases such as <b>iron</b> <b>carbonate</b> (FeCO3), or iron(II) hydroxycarbonate (Fe2(OH)2(CO3), chukanovite) isomorphic to copper(II) hydroxycarbonate (Cu2(OH)2(CO3), malachite) in the copper system.|$|E

The seams are often oolitic, {{especially in the}} north of the district, but vary in constitution across the ore-field. The ooids (on average) comprise ~33% siderite, ~33% berthierine, and a similar proportion of ancillary minerals and demonstrate deformation whilst the sediment was still plastic.|$|E

5000|$|Taranakite was rediscovered in two cave locations, {{and given}} two new names. In 1894, Armand Gautier {{described}} a mineral {{which he called}} minervite from caves at Grotte de Minerve in [...] Hérault, France and argued that it formed from decomposing guano and animal remains reacting with clays. He experimentally justified this by reacting ammonium phosphate with gelatinous aluminium oxide, <b>iron</b> <b>carbonate,</b> and limestone. These reactions yielded a minervatie-like compound, and iron and calcium phosphates similar to what he observed in the caves. In 1904 Eugenio Casoria found a mineral under a guano layer at Monte Alburno, Italy which he called palmerite. These two minerals were later identified through X-ray powder diffraction as taranakite and discredited in favor of taranakite by historical priority.|$|E
5000|$|Magnetite and {{hematite}} are opaque {{under the}} microscope under transmitted light. Under reflected light, magnetite shows up as metallic and a silver or black color. Hematite will be a more reddish-yellow color. Pyrite is seen as opaque, a yellow-gold color, and metallic. [...] Chamosite is an olive-green color in thin section that readily oxidizes to limonite. When it is partially or fully oxidized to limonite, the green color becomes a yellow-ish brown. Limonite is opaque {{under the microscope}} as well. Chamosite is an iron silicate {{and it has a}} birefringence of almost zero. Siderite is an <b>iron</b> <b>carbonate</b> and it has a very high birefringence. The thin sections often reveal marine fauna within oolitic ironstones. In older samples, the ooids may be squished and have hooked tails on either end due to compaction.|$|E
40|$|To {{optimize}} {{simulations of}} CW EPR spectra for high-spin Fe(III) with zero-field splitting {{comparable to the}} EPR quantum, information is needed on the {{factors that contribute to}} the line shapes and line widths. Continuous wave electron paramagnetic resonance (EPR) spectra obtained for <b>iron</b> transferrin <b>carbonate</b> from 4 to 150 K and for iron transferrin oxalate from 4 to 100 K did not exhibit significant temperature dependence of the line shape, which suggested that the line shapes were not relaxation determined. To obtain direct information concerning the electron spin relaxation rates, electron spin echo and inversion recovery EPR were used to measure T 1 and Tm for the high-spin Fe(III) in <b>iron</b> transferrin <b>carbonate</b> and <b>iron</b> transferrin oxalate between 5 and 20 - 30 K. For comparison with the data for the transferrin complexes, relaxation times were obtained for tris(oxalato) ferrate(III). The relaxation rates are similar for the three complexes and do not exhibit a strong dependence on position in the spectrum. Extrapolation of the observed temperature dependence of the relaxation rates to higher temperatures gives values consistent with the conclusion that the CW line shapes are not relaxation determined up to 150 K...|$|R
