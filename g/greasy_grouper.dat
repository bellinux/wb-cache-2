40|$|Betanodaviruses {{are small}} positive-sense bipartite RNA viruses that infect {{a wide variety}} of fish species and are notorious for causing lethal {{outbreaks}} in juvenile fish hatcheries worldwide. The function of a small nonstructural protein, B 2, encoded by the subgenomic RNA 3 of betanodaviruses, has remained obscure. <b>Greasy</b> <b>grouper</b> nervous necrosis virus, a betanodavirus model, was used to develop a facile DNA-based reverse genetics system that recapitulated the virus infection cycle, and we used this system to show that B 2 is a small nonstructural protein that is essential for high level accumulation of viral RNA 1 after RNA transfection of fish, mammalian, and avian cells. The defect in RNA 1 accumulation in a B 2 mutant was partially complemented by supplying B 2 RNA in trans. Confocal analysis of the cellular distribution of B 2 indicated that B 2 is able to enter the nucleus and accumulates there during the late stages of GGNNV infection. Using human HeLa cells as a cellular RNA interference model, we found that B 2 could efficiently antagonize RNA interference, which is a property shared by the distantly related alphanodavirus B 2 proteins.

40|$|AbstractBetanodavirus <b>greasy</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus tauvina) nervous {{necrosis}} viruses (GGNNV) protein α, a virus capsid protein, {{was detected}} in both nucleolus and cytoplasm of infected cells of Asian sea bass (SB) and transfected cells of SB and Cos- 7 with pcDNA 3. 1 /RNA 2. To study its subcellular localization, ORF of protein α with 338 aa was fused with enhanced {{green fluorescent protein}} (EGFP) gene and was detected in transfected cells {{in the absence of}} other viral proteins. In both SB and Cos- 7 cells, protein α was found to localize EGFP to the nucleolus and cytoplasm. Deletion mutants of protein α indicated that N-terminal 43 amino acid residues were required to import EGFP-α protein into the nucleolus. Further deletions within the 43 amino acid backbone, EGFP/ 33 aa(1 – 33) and EGFP/ 30 aa(14 – 43), localized to the nucleolus, suggesting that the 20 amino acids from 14 to 33 of protein α were the domain of nucleolus localization. To further determine the nucleolus targeting sequence, deletion mutations within the 20 amino acids of protein α were constructed. It was found that the deletion of 23 RRR 25, 29 RRR 31, or 23 RRRANNRRR 31 prevented the accumulation of EGFP fusion proteins into the nucleolus, demonstrating that 23 RRRANNRRR 31 contain the signal required for nucleolar localization. A similar distribution pattern of localization of protein α and its deletion mutants in SB and Cos- 7 cells suggested that N-terminal residues of protein α 23 RRRANNRRR 31 constitute a nucleolus localization signal that functions in both fish and mammalian cells...|$|E
40|$|AbstractBetanodaviruses, {{members of}} the Nodaviridae family, are the causative agents of viral nervous {{necrosis}} in fish and infection by which cause high mortality in larvae and juveniles {{in a wide range}} of marine fish species in Asia, Europe, Australia, Martinique, and Tahit. <b>Greasy</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus tauvina) nervous necrosis viruses (GGNNV) were investigated for their apoptotic activity in culture cells. GGNNV infection of sea bass (SB) cells appeared to induce a typical cytopathic effect (CPE), i. e., cytoplasmic vacuolation, thinning, rounding up, detachment of infected cells from the cultured dish, and eventually cell lysis and death. The infected SB cells underwent DNA fragmentation and stained positive in terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT) -mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) assay, suggesting that GGNNV infection induced apoptosis in SB cells. In addition, GGNNV-infected SB cells showed an increased activity of caspase- 8 -like proteases (IETDase) and caspase- 3 -like proteases (IETDase), whereas inhibitor of caspase- 8 and caspase- 3 reduced GGNNV-induced apoptosis. This suggests that GGNNV may promote apoptosis via the extrinsic pathway in SB cells. Protein α, the precursor of GGNNV capsid proteins, was transiently expressed in SB and Cos- 7 cells. The DNA fragmentation and TUNEL positive signal were apparent in SB and Cos- 7 cells expressing protein α, suggesting that protein α may serve as an apoptotic inducer in these cells. Moreover, expression of protein α resulted in the activation of caspase- 3 -like proteases in both cells, which could be inhibited by a caspase- 3 -like protease specific inhibitor DEVD-CHO peptide. These results suggest that fish caspases are important elements in GGNNV-meditated apoptosis...|$|E
40|$|Localization of RNA {{replication}} to intracellular membranes is {{a universal}} feature of positive-strand RNA viruses. The betanodavirus <b>greasy</b> <b>grouper</b> (Epinephelus tauvina) nervous necrosis virus (GGNNV) is a positive-RNA virus {{with one of the}} smallest genomes among RNA viruses replicating in fish cells. To understand the localization of GGNNV replication complexes, we generated polyclonal antisera against protein A, the GGNNV RNA-dependent RNA polymerase. Protein A was detected at 5 h postinfection in infected sea bass cells. Biochemical fractionation experiments revealed that GGNNV protein A sedimented with intracellular membranes upon treatment with an alkaline pH and a high salt concentration, indicating that GGNNV protein A is tightly associated with intracellular membranes in infected cells. Confocal immunofluorescence microscopy and bromo-UTP incorporation studies identified mitochondria as the intracellular site of protein A localization and viral RNA synthesis. In addition, protein A fused with green fluorescent protein (GFP) was detected in the mitochondria in transfected cells and was demonstrated to be tightly associated with intracellular membranes by biochemical fractionation analysis and membrane flotation assays, indicating that protein A alone was sufficient for mitochondrial localization in the absence of RNA replication, nonstructural protein B, or capsid proteins. Three sequence analysis programs showed two regions of hydrophobic amino acid residues, amino acids 153 to 173 and 229 to 249, to be transmembrane domains (TMD) that might contain a membrane association domain. Membrane fraction analysis showed that the major domain is N-terminal amino acids 215 to 255, containing the predicted TMD from amino acids 229 to 249. Using GFP as the reporter by systematically introducing deletions of these two regions in the constructs, we further confirmed that the N-terminal amino acids 215 to 255 of protein A function as a mitochondrial targeting signal...|$|E

In addition, Hg and methylmercury were analyzed in scalp hair of 19 fishermen living in the same coastal stations of the Persian Gulf and consuming several fish meals a week. Total mercury concentrations in fish muscle and liver ranged from 0. 01 to 1. 35  µg g - 1 w. w. and from 0. 02 to 1. 30  µg g - 1 w. w., respectively. In fish muscle, 3 % of the Hg concentrations were higher than 0. 5  µg g - 1 w. w., which corresponds to the maximum acceptable WHO level, while 9 % were in the range of polluted fish (between 0. 3 and 0. 5  µg g - 1 w. w.). The highest mercury concentrations in fish muscle were observed in flathead fish at Abadan (average of 0. 68  µ g g - 1 w. w.). Methylmercury fractions in fish muscle and liver amount to 34 – 99 % (median 64 %) and 24 – 70 % (median 43 %), respectively. The mean total Hg concentration in the fishermen’s scalp hair amounted to 2. 9 ± 2. 2  µ g g - 1, with 68 % in the form of methylmercury. Ninety-five percent of the Hg levels in the fishermen’s hair were below 10  µ g g - 1, which is the WHO warning limit. In addition, relationships between the mercury levels in hair, on the one hand, and exposure-related factors such as Hg levels in specific fish species, regional differences, and number of fish meals, on the other hand, are discussed. It appears that a significant correlation for example exists between Hg levels human hair and fish muscle or human hair and age and that mean mercury levels in fish muscle and human hair decreased from western (Abadan) to eastern (Abbas port) coastal sites...|$|E
