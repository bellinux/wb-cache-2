5|$|The {{payment of}} death duties and the {{difficulty}} of maintaining a large estate during the Second World War forced the Cubitt family to begin selling packets of land. Cubitt's mansion was abandoned until its demolition in 1953, by which time the family was living in a Regency-style house converted from the housing that had been provided <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> and stable staff in more affluent times.|$|E
5|$|The {{original}} idea <b>for</b> <b>The</b> <b>Garden</b> of Words came from Shinkai's desire {{to capture the}} beauty of the daily scenery in modern Tokyo and showcase it in a film. Having lived for ten years in Shinjuku, he selected it as the location of the film and set about taking thousands of photos, upon which he created his storyboards. Wanting to share the peace and harmony of his favorite locations in Japan with the hope that it would encourage people to visit, Shinkai modeled the garden in the film to match Shinjuku Gyoen National Garden in Tokyo. Following the earthquake in March 2011, he was worried that it could be destroyed and wanted to preserve it in an animated film.|$|E

5|$|Throughout {{his career}} Douglas {{attracted}} commissions from wealthy and important patrons. His first-known independent work was an ornament, {{which is no}} longer in existence, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> of the Honourable MrsCholmondeley. She was the sister-in-law of Hugh Cholmondeley, 2nd Baron Delamere, and it was from the 2ndBaron that Douglas received his first major commission, a considerable rebuilding of the south wing of his seat at Vale Royal Abbey in 1860. Around the same time, Lord Delamere commissioned him to build the church of St John the Evangelist at Over, Winsford, as a memorial to his first wife.|$|E
5|$|Roland {{was born}} on 26 January 1899 and {{initially}} followed {{a career in the}} army. He married Sonia Rosemary Keppel on 16 November 1920 and they had three children: two sons, Henry and Jeremy (1927–1958); and a daughter, Rosalind. Death duties and the Second World War impacted greatly on the estate: staffing was a problem, and maintenance and general repair costs were unsustainable. The Home Guard requisitioned a section of the mansion as its headquarters and based a training school there. Hugh Pollock, husband of the author Enid Blyton, re-ignited his adulterous affair with Ida Crowe after arranging work there for her as a civilian secretary. Roland transformed the buildings that had previously been used as housing <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> and stable staff into a Regency-style house. Flooring and doors were stripped from the old mansion to be incorporated in the new house, leaving just the basic structure of Cubitt's original mansion, which had been empty since 1947. Furniture was disposed of in a clearance sale at Dorking in mid-July 1952. Cubitt's mansion was within a designated preservation area, causing the local council to refuse any suggestions that were put forward for the old mansion to be used for commercial purposes. Contractors were brought in to demolish the mansion in 1953; the company may have encountered financial problems, as the basement was not fully destroyed and was left filled with rubble from the higher levels.|$|E

25|$|A pair of courtyards {{is found}} in the {{northern}} corners of the jilaukhana which provided quarters (Khawasspuras) for the tombs attendants and the Hafiz. This residential element provided a transition between the outside world and the other-worldy delights of the tomb complex. The Khawasspurs had fallen into a state of disrepair by the late 18th century but the institution of the Khadim continued into the 20th century. The Khawasspuras were restored by Lord Curzon as part of his repairs between 1900 and 1908, after which the western courtyard was used as a nursery <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> and the western courtyard was used as a cattle stable until 2003.|$|E
25|$|After {{the death}} of Alexander the Great, Perdiccas {{expelled}} the Athenian settlers on Samos to Colophon, {{on the coast of}} what is now Turkey. After the completion of his military service, Epicurus joined his family there. He studied under Nausiphanes, who followed the teachings of Democritus. In 311/310BC Epicurus taught in Mytilene but caused strife and was forced to leave. He then founded a school in Lampsacus before returning to Athens in 306BC where he remained until his death. There he founded The Garden (κῆπος), a school named <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> he owned that served as the school's meeting place, about halfway between the locations of two other schools of philosophy, the Stoa and the Academy.|$|E
25|$|Under the {{patronage}} of the extravagantly wealthy {{and most powerful}} Cardinal Scipione Borghese, the young Bernini rapidly rose to prominence as a sculptor. Among his early works for the cardinal were decorative pieces <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>garden</b> of the Villa Borghese such as The Goat Amalthea with the Infant Jupiter and a Faun, and several allegorical busts, including the so-called Damned Soul and Blessed Soul, {{which may have been}} influenced by a set of prints by Pieter de Jode I but which were in fact long cataloged in the inventory of their original owner as depicting a nymph and s satyr, a commonly paired duo in ancient sculpture. By the time he was twenty-two, Bernini was considered talented enough to have been given a commission for a papal portrait, the Bust of Pope Paul V, now in the J. Paul Getty Museum.|$|E
