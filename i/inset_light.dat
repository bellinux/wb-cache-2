50|$|The Lafayette Street Overpass is a {{historic}} bridge in Fayetteville, Arkansas. It is a three-span open masonry structure, carrying Lafayette Street over the tracks of the St. Louis-San Francisco Railway. The bridge is about 120 ft long and 30 ft wide, and consists of reinforced concrete spans resting on concrete abutments. It features an Art Deco railing, with a metal balustrade covering concrete piers with <b>inset</b> <b>light</b> fixtures. The bridge was built in 1938 by Ed B. Mooney, Inc.|$|E
2500|$|CAT II ILS became {{operational}} on 23 December 2011 {{and reduced}} the visibility requirement for an aircraft landing at Amritsar Airport on Runway 34 from the existing 650 metres to 350 metres benefiting airlines in terms of increased safety and avoiding diversions to other airports resulting in better operational and environmental efficiency. During 2016-17 runway upgrade, the flexible portion runway was strengthed and <b>inset</b> <b>lighting</b> installed for ILS CAT III {{at a cost of}} 150 crores.|$|R
50|$|The Maple Street Overpass is a {{historic}} bridge in Fayetteville, Arkansas. The bridge carries West Maple Street over the railroad tracks running {{just east of the}} University of Arkansas at Fayetteville campus. It is a reinforced concrete single-span arch, 60 ft in length and 25 ft in width. The bridge has a decorative Art Deco balustrade with <b>inset</b> <b>lights</b> on both sides. The bridge was designed by Frederick Lutt Johann, a regionally noted bridge designer, and built in 1936.|$|R

50|$|Important design {{elements}} such as the classic horse shoe grille, <b>inset</b> front <b>lights,</b> converging front hood and an exposed intake plenum would eventually {{be integrated into the}} production Bugatti Veyron EB 16.4.|$|R
25|$|The 1968 XT model {{featured}} a mild facelift, with a divided grille, and <b>inset</b> driving <b>lights</b> for the GT. The GT also replaced the thick lower body stripes of the XR with narrow stripes along the waistline from grille to tail light. The tail lights were still round, {{but instead of}} the small round indicator of the XR, the XT model had a long indicator across the light. Otherwise, all external body panels and bumpers {{were the same as}} the XR.|$|R
40|$|The Federal Highway Administration (FHWA) {{estimates}} that 58 percent of roadway fatalities are lane departures, while 40 percent of fatalities are single-vehicle run-off-road (SVROR) crashes. Addressing lane-departure crashes {{is therefore a}} priority for national, state, and local roadway agencies. Horizontal curves are of particular interest {{because they have been}} correlated with increased crash occurrence. This toolbox was developed to assist agencies address crashes at rural curves. The main objective of this toolbox is to summarize the effectiveness of various known curve countermeasures. While education, enforcement, and policy countermeasures should also be considered, they were not included given the toolbox focuses on roadway-based countermeasures. Furthermore, the toolbox is geared toward rural two-lane curves. The research team identified countermeasures based on their own research, through a survey of the literature, and through discussions with other professionals. Coverage of curve countermeasures in this toolbox is not necessarily comprehensive. For each countermeasure covered, this toolbox includes the following information: description, application, effectiveness, advantages, and disadvantages. Countermeasures covered are as follows: speed signs, chevrons, widening/adding paved shoulders, reflective barriers, high-friction treatments, raised pavement markers, edge lines, transverse pavement markings, vertical delineation, rumble strips, rumble stripes, on-pavement curve signing, flashing beacons, dynamic curve warning systems, and pavement <b>inset</b> <b>lights...</b>|$|R
50|$|The form of {{the tower}} was {{inspired}} by the unique ice mountain topography around the city, with an angled, mountainous façade that emulates the cool bluish hue of the rocky formations in deep winter. Like the mountain ridges reflecting the light of the sky and the valleys reflecting light from the earth, the tower will perform as a light sculpture to diffuse light from 360 degrees, creating a connection between the ground plane and the sky. A series of <b>inset</b> LED <b>lights</b> along the exterior will enhance this effect at night, causing the tower itself to be an enduring visual centerpiece for the larger development.|$|R
50|$|The Majestic Theater, {{designed}} by John Eberson and constructed downtown in 1923, {{is considered to}} be the most notable movie theatre built in the city. The design was not of a standard theatre interior, but an outdoor plaza and garden of with a starlit sky overhead. The Mediterranean blue ceiling, <b>inset</b> with twinkling <b>lights,</b> featured clouds that floated {{over the heads of the}} audience during screenings. The Majestic was the world’s first “atmospheric” movie theatre.|$|R
50|$|John Street Roundhouse could {{maintain}} 32 locomotives at a time. 32 bay doors {{make up the}} inner rounded facade {{of the building and}} face the 120 foot turntable. This turntable was the largest used by the Canadian Pacific Railway Company and was constructed by the Canadian Bridge Company. The exterior and interior of the building is mostly composed of brick and glazing. Each of the bay doors is of wood construction and can be left open to reveal a floor to ceiling glass wall with a regular sized man door <b>inset.</b> Natural <b>light</b> floods the interior space from the curved loft space and all exterior facades. Refurbished wooden columns also stand within the interior of the structure. The coaling tower and water tank are auxiliary structures still located in the park from the working days of the John Street Roundhouse.|$|R
50|$|The {{crown of}} {{justification}} {{might be made}} of laurel, palm, feathers, papyrus, or precious metals. It was syncretized with the solar crown of the sun god Re, and might be made of gold to mimic {{the properties of the}} sun. Among the collections of the Museum of Fine Arts, Boston, is an intricately woven papyrus wreath with bronze <b>insets</b> to reflect <b>light.</b> In the Roman era, initiates into the mysteries of Isis might wear a wreath of palm leaves to suggest the rays of the sun.|$|R
25|$|Attached to {{the nave}} are {{the north and}} south aisles. The early 15th-century north aisle is of string-coursed ashlar, buttressed, with four windows of same {{appearance}} and stylerectilinear with <b>inset</b> three <b>lights</b> of simple round head, diamond-pattern leaded clear glazing, and flattened hood moulds. Three windows are placed on the north wall, the fourth serves as the aisle west window. Between the two north wall western windows is a simply moulded and slightly pointed door opening with hood mould and label stops, and a carved finial above. Within is a face-hinged oak door. The north aisle parapet is deeply crenellated to the same style as the tower battlements. Above the windows runs a moulding, defining the roof edge {{at the base of the}} parapet, holding two gargoyles which drain the aisle roof. Two double-stepped angle buttresses support the aisle on its north wall, with a third diagonal buttress at the north-west corner.|$|R
50|$|The Chevrolet Tahoe Z71 also {{exhibited}} a monochromatic appearance {{similar to the}} Tahoe Limited, but instead of black onyx metallic the Tahoe Z71 was offered in either light pewter metallic, victory red, emerald green metallic, or indigo blue metallic. Features of the Tahoe Z71 {{were similar to those}} of the Tahoe Limited with a few key differences to distinguish the 2WD Tahoe Limited from the 4WD Tahoe Z71. Features that differ from those previously mentioned on the Tahoe Limited included the Z71 off-road chassis package (46 mm Bilstein shock absorbers, a standard 3.73 rear gear ratio G80 locking differential), body colored wheel flares, trim, grille and bumpers, <b>inset</b> driving <b>lights</b> built into the center of the front bumper, oversized two row radiator, two tone leather seating surfaces in either a gray or neutral theme, distinctive tail lamp lens covers, black tubular side assist step bars, black brush guard, and distinctive 16 inch Alcoa five spoke 6 bolt polished aluminum wheels.|$|R
2500|$|The window hood moulds {{are similar}} to the south chapel but run into a further cill band around the north and east wall. Within the central bay of the north wall is a chapel doorway opening that breaks through the plinth. The opening is a twin-mould recess, with arch above {{surrounded}} by a hood mould. The door planking is set behind raised and studded rails and stiles with <b>inset</b> moulded blind <b>lights.</b> The chancel east wall between the chapels is plain except for a simple cill band above the roof line, and a shallow coped gable with a central cross above. The chancel east window is of three lights with cinquefoil heads set in a moulded frame. Pevsner states that the window [...] "makes an odd east view with the chancel east window, smaller, recent, and straight-headed, between." [...] Two spouts, dressed with gargoyle heads, drain the roof between the chancel and the chapels.|$|R
40|$|The {{optoelectronic}} {{properties of}} {{a new type of}} organic light-emitting diode have been measured, which incorporates in the active layer a molecule containing as well an electron conducting and blue emitting oxadiazole group and a hole conducting carbazole group. The investigated device consists of this active oxadiazole/carbazole layer deposited by spin-coating on transparent conductive oxide (TCO) covered glass substrate and top aluminium contacts for electron injection. We compared two types of devices, with and without the insertion of a 40 nm thick spin-coated PEDOT layer as hole injector between the active and the TCO layer. Stable blue emission has been observed only for the device with inserted PEDOT layer with an <b>inset</b> of the <b>light</b> emission at an applied voltage of 10 V. For devices without PEDOT layer a much higher threshold voltage for light emission and a lower quantum efficiency as compared to the device with intermediate PEDOT layer has been found...|$|R
50|$|St Michael's is {{constructed}} in stone rubble with ashlar dressings, and has slate roofs. Its plan {{consists of a}} four-bay nave, a south porch, an apsidal chancel, a south organ chamber with an aisle, and a west tower. The tower has diagonal buttresses, a two-light west window, straight-headed bell openings, and an embattled parapet. The nave windows have two-lights and straight heads, and contain Decorated tracery. The east window has five lights, and {{the window in the}} organ chamber has three <b>lights.</b> <b>Inset</b> into the wall of the inner entrance to the church is a Norman tympanum carved with runes, and the image of Christ and a cross. There are also damaged Norman capitals built into the porch, and fragments of carved stones elsewhere inside the church. The octagonal font is medieval and is tulip-shaped. All the stained glass was made by Powell. The two-manual pipe organ was made by Jardine and Company of Manchester.|$|R
40|$|Figure 1 : Our {{heterodyne}} light field camera provides 4 D light {{field and}} full-resolution focused image simultaneously. (First Column) Raw sensor image. (Second Column) Scene parts which are in-focus can be recovered at full resolution. (Third Column) <b>Inset</b> shows fine-scale <b>light</b> field encoding (top) {{and the corresponding}} part of the recovered full resolution image (bottom). (Last Column) Far focused and near focused images obtained from the light field. We describe a theoretical framework for reversibly modulating 4 D light fields using an attenuating mask in the optical path of a lens based camera. Based on this framework, we present a novel design to reconstruct the 4 D light field from a 2 D camera image without any additional refractive elements as required by previous light field cameras. The patterned mask attenuates light rays inside the camera instead of bending them, and the attenuation recoverably encodes the rays on the 2 D sensor. Our mask-equipped camera focuses just as a traditional camera to capture conventional 2 D photos at full sensor resolution, but the raw pixel values also hold a modulate...|$|R
5000|$|The south aisle {{south and}} west windows reflect {{completely}} the style and date {{of those in the}} north aisle. Attached to the south aisle, and opposite the porch on the north, is a 19th-century gabled vestry—not evident in an 1806 plan—partly set behind a wall and iron fence enclosure. The vestry window at the south is of a single light with panes of glear glazing set in square muntins, within a double chamfered arched surround with hood mould. At {{the west side of the}} vestry is a plank door within an ogee-headed moulded doorway.The 1448 south chapel sits on a moulded plinth which runs over two twin-stepped buttresses, one angled and central to the south wall, the other diagonal on the south-east corner. The buttresses are topped by square-based pinnacles with blind cusped panels, crocketed above gables at each side, the pinnacle at the south-east finished with a finial. The parapet is embattled with moulded coping, which runs as a gable end at the east end and includes a central cross above. At the roof line at the base of the parapet and the buttress tops runs a moulded cill band—angled projection that allows water to flow from a building face—which continues around the east side and follows the line of the gable end. Either side of the south wall buttress is a three light window with cinquefoil heads, with six panels above with trefoil heads, enclosed in a moulded surround, and set with stained glass. The window opening has a flattened arch above the spring with a following hood mould. The 1460-70 north chapel also sits on a moulded plinth. Its angle buttresses are similar style to the south chapel, including cill band, although four in number on the north wall defining three external bays with three windows. These and the chapel east window are all of three lights with simple 'Y' tracery and cinquefoil heads.The window hood moulds are similar to the south chapel but run into a further cill band around the north and east wall. Within the central bay of the north wall is a chapel doorway opening that breaks through the plinth. The opening is a twin-mould recess, with arch above surrounded by a hood mould. The door planking is set behind raised and studded rails and stiles with <b>inset</b> moulded blind <b>lights.</b> The chancel east wall between the chapels is plain except for a simple cill band above the roof line, and a shallow coped gable with a central cross above.
