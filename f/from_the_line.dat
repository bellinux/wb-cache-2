5|$|Environmental {{mitigation}} {{measures in the}} line's construction phase included the construction of animal bridges over the line, the planting and re-planting of trees along the track as noise screens, and the purchase of farmland to create a preservation area for jacana birds (水雉) away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b>|$|E
5|$|Maslama {{was the son}} of the Umayyad caliph Abd al-Malik ibn Marwan (reigned 685–705) and {{half-brother}} of the caliphs al-Walid I (r. 705–715), Sulayman (r. 715–717), Yazid II (r. 720–724) and Hisham (r. 724–743). Maslama {{himself was}} excluded <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of succession as his mother was a slave.|$|E
5|$|On 6 July 1553, {{at the age}} of 15, Edward VI {{died from}} a lung infection, {{possibly}} tuberculosis. He did not want the crown to go to Mary, because he feared she would restore Catholicism and undo his reforms {{as well as those of}} Henry VIII, and so he planned to exclude her <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of succession. His advisers, however, told him that he could not disinherit only one of his sisters: He would have to disinherit Elizabeth as well, even though she was a Protestant. Guided by John Dudley, 1st Duke of Northumberland, and perhaps others, Edward excluded both of his sisters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of succession in his will.|$|E

5|$|The Chakri Dynasty of Thailand has {{included}} marriages between royal relatives, but marriages between dynasts and foreigners, including foreign royals, are rare. This {{is in part}} due to Section 11 of 1924 Palace Law of Succession which excludes {{members of the royal family}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of succession if they marry a non-Thai national.|$|E
5|$|As {{that battle}} on the Somme dragged on, the Canadian Corps {{was brought up}} and the AIF was {{withdrawn}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> to re-organise and reform, having suffered almost 23,000 casualties {{over the course of}} the 45 days that they had been involved. The 5th Division had been so badly mauled, having been incapacitated by the losses they had suffered at Fromelles, that it was not until October that the 5th Division finally returned to the line and joined the 1st, 2nd and 4th Divisions on the Somme near Flers.|$|E

5|$|Claimants <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of Moana Wahine made {{petitions}} to {{the court}} under the act of 1874 to quite land titles. The act was later deemed unconstitutional and a new decree of heirship was made. By December 1879 disbursement of land in trust with William Cooper Parke, (Marshal of Hawaii from 1853 to 1884) and owned by heirs, could not be agreed upon for settlement. Most supported {{the sale of the}} lands, so an order was made and all land sold at auction.|$|E
5|$|Hair {{length is}} most often {{measured}} (in centimeters or inches) <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> of the scalp on the forehead up over the highest point of the skull to its termination, and sometimes from the crown, the latter resulting in 10 centimeter lower values in average. In cosmetology, hair lengths are usually categorized according to {{the part of the}} body where the bulk of the longest hair terminates: chin level, shoulder length, lower shoulderblade/mid-back level, waist length, hip-length, classic length (extends to almost buttock-length, i.e. upper thigh-length, where the legs meet the buttocks), thigh-length, knee-length and ankle/floor length hair.|$|E
5|$|In {{his fifth}} {{year with the}} Grizzlies, he became the franchise's all-time leading rebounder on March 24 against the New York Knicks when he grabbed his 3,072nd rebound in a Grizzlies uniform. He made 29 {{consecutive}} free throw attempts from January 24 to 28, tying the second best mark in Grizzlies history, including two straight games going 12–12 <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line,</b> tying the best single-game mark in franchise history. Gasol and the Grizzlies returned to {{the playoffs for the}} third time in his and his team's history. Once again, they were eliminated in the first round and did not win a single game against the Dallas Mavericks.|$|E

5|$|Located on an embankment, {{the station}} has four tracks {{with only the}} two outer ones in revenue service. The two center express tracks have been {{disconnected}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> and have permanently been removed from service. North of this station, {{a portion of the}} southbound express track connects with the southbound local track at its north end, and ends at a bumper block at its southern end. This section of track can be used for revenue service or work train layups, but this use has been made completely redundant because of the nearby Pitkin Yard serving as the primary layup yard instead.|$|E
5|$|On 16 June, the 45th Division withdrew for rest in {{preparation}} for other operations. At this time, VI Corps {{was attached to the}} Seventh Army, under Lieutenant General Alexander Patch, itself part of the 12th Army Group under Lieutenant General Jacob L. Devers. The 45th, 36th, and 3rd Infantry Divisions were pulled <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in Italy {{in preparation}} for Operation Dragoon (formerly Anvil), the invasion of southern France. Dragoon was originally planned to coincide with the Normandy landings in the north, but was delayed until August because of a shortage of landing craft.|$|E
5|$|On 23 September the {{battalion}} was relieved by American forces. At {{this time they}} were withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{along with the rest}} of the 1st Division. They would take no further part in the fighting. In early October, the rest of the Australian Corps, severely depleted due to heavy casualties and falling enlistments in Australia, was also withdrawn upon a request made by Prime Minister Billy Hughes, to re-organise in preparation for further operations. On 11 November, an armistice came into effect, and as hostilities came to an end, {{the battalion}}'s personnel were slowly repatriated back to Australia for demobilisation and discharge. This was completed in May 1919.|$|E

5|$|The {{attack on}} Orsonga began at 3:30pm, {{following}} a half-hour artillery bombardment, and marked the battalion's first battle on Italian soil. Although initially some progress was made, the Germans {{managed to hold}} Orsonga throughout December amidst intense hand-to-hand fighting. Finally, the Māoris were withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> {{on the night of}} 15/16 January 1944 when they were relieved by an Indian unit. Over the course of the battle, they had lost 11 men killed and 222 wounded.|$|E
5|$|The {{attacks of}} 28 March were a {{continuation}} of the rapid advances that had so shattered the Fifth Army since the first days of the Spring Offensive. Prisoners of war taken by the 48th Battalion attested to {{the fact that this was}} not a set-piece assault, but merely an attack off the line of march. The 50th Reserve Division was in no state to renew the offensive on the following day, and 229 RIR was withdrawn <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line.</b> It had suffered 309 casualties, with 230 RIR losing another 240.|$|E
5|$|The {{remainder}} of the line, between Llangefni and Amlwch, looks set to be preserved as a heritage railway, with Network Rail giving licence to Anglesey Central Railway Limited to begin clearing the overgrown line north of Llangefni. ACR started to clear vegetation <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> in Llangefni before Christmas 2012. ACR Limited's support group, Lein Amlwch, have also opened a small shop, cafe and heritage centre in Llanerchymedd's station building, which will be open during the summer months.|$|E

5|$|About 09:45, the LI Infantry Corps began {{crossing}} the Drava, but {{construction of a}} bridge near Maribor was suspended because the river was in flood. Despite this, the 183rd Infantry Division managed to secure an alternative crossing point, and established a bridgehead. This crossing point was a partially destroyed bridge, guarded by a single platoon of the 1st Bicycle Battalion of Detachment Ormozki. This crossing, combined with {{the withdrawal of the}} 7th Army's 38th Infantry Division Dravska <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> Slovenska Bistrica–Ptuj exposed the left flank of Detachment Ormozki. The Detachment attempted to withdraw south, but began to disintegrate during the night 10/11 April, and the 1st Bicycle Battalion left to return to Ljubljana. In the afternoon, the remaining elements of the 42nd Infantry Division Murska also began to withdraw though Varaždinske Toplice to Novi Marof, leaving the Ustaše to take control of Varaždin.|$|E
5|$|After this, the Australian Corps {{was removed}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> for rest and {{training}} in preparation for further operations. In order {{to make up for}} the losses the Australians had suffered during the previous months, a number of Australian battalions were disbanded at this time to provide reinforcements to those that remained. The 32nd Battalion received a large number of reinforcements from the all-Victorian 29th Battalion, which was subsequently disbanded. It was still out of the line when the Armistice was declared on 11 November 1918. During the battalion's final series of battles, the battalion was led by Major Blair Wark, who was later awarded the Victoria Cross for his leadership and bravery.|$|E
5|$|Archaeological {{evidence}} shows that Zhou dynasty divination was grounded in cleromancy, the production of seemingly random numbers to determine divine intent. The Zhou yi provided a guide to cleromancy that used the stalks of the yarrow plant, {{but it is not}} known how the yarrow stalks became numbers, or how specific lines were chosen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>line</b> readings. In the hexagrams, broken lines were used as shorthand for the numbers 6 (六) and 8 (八), and solid lines were shorthand for values of 7 (七) and 9 (九). The Great Commentary contains a late classic description of a process where various numerological operations are performed on a bundle of 50 stalks, leaving remainders of 6 to 9. Like the Zhou yi itself, yarrow stalk divination dates to the Western Zhou period, although its modern form is a reconstruction.|$|E
