25|$|In the {{animated}} short , a new apprentice code named Tiger Claw is joining the G.I. Joe team, and learns of Snake Eyes' and Storm Shadow's {{past in the}} Arashikage Clan.

25|$|Certain {{authors have}} prostitutes talking about themselves: Lucian in his Dialogue of courtesans or Alciphron in his {{collection}} of letters; but these are works of fiction. The prostitutes of concern here are either independent or hetaera: the sources <b>here</b> <b>do</b> not concern themselves with the situation of slave-prostitutes, except to consider them {{as a source of}} profit. It is quite clear what ancient Greek men thought of prostitutes: primarily, they are reproached for the commercial nature of the activity. The greed of prostitutes is a running theme in Greek comedy. The fact that prostitutes were the only Athenian women who handled money likely increased male acrimony. An explanation for their behavior is that a prostitute's career tended to be short, and their income decreased with the passage of time: a young and pretty prostitute, across all levels of the trade, could earn more money than her older, less attractive colleagues. To provide for old age, they thus had to acquire as much money as possible in a limited period of time.|$|E
500|$|Following Roy Wilkins' comments, white opinion {{began to}} shift. According to {{historian}} Stephen Whitfield, a specific brand of xenophobia in the South was particularly strong in Mississippi. Whites were urged {{to reject the}} influence of Northern opinion and agitation. This independent attitude was profound enough in Tallahatchie County that it earned the nickname [...] "The Freestate of Tallahatchie," [...] according to a former sheriff, [...] "because people <b>here</b> <b>do</b> what they damn well please," [...] making the county often difficult to govern.|$|E

500|$|For {{the timing}} of {{introducing}} the new characters, the showrunners decided to introduce the Punisher immediately and hold back on Elektra briefly, with Ramirez explaining that [...] "one of the pitfalls when we have this many great characters to play with is wanting to throw them at the wall", but {{it was important to}} take the time to introduce the new characters properly to the audience, particularly to the people who weren't already familiar with them. Elaborating on the aim to keep the story focused on Murdock, Petrie revealed that the writers would often come up with [...] "amazing stuff" [...] for the season, but then realize that they had forgotten about Murdock and had to [...] "completely turn it over and look at how this affects Matt and filter it through that prism." [...] Ramirez added,It could easily become The Punisher story or the Elektra story that Matt cameos in, and not vice versa. So, we built it like a Matt story, in terms of what we wanted to put him through, where we wanted to get him, by the end of the season, and what we wanted to have him learn about himself, and we used an Elektra and Frank story throughout, to get him there... we talked about when we watch shows in 13 episode stretches, how do we watch them? What is an exciting structure that we would like to think about <b>here?</b> <b>Do</b> we divide it right down the middle? Do we do a three-act structure?...If you were to sit and watch 13 episodes, you would absolutely feel a structure, much like in the comics. That’s what we did this season.|$|E

2500|$|Justice Breyer's {{concurrence}} {{stressed that}} the majority opinion was rather specific, writing [...] "the circumstances here include the following": The search at issue was a search solely for evidence. The objecting party was present and made his objection known clearly and directly to the officers seeking to enter the house. The officers did not justify their search on grounds of possible evidence destruction. Cf. Thornton v. United States, 541 U.S. 615, 620–622 (2004); Skinner v. Railway Labor Executives' Assn., 489 U.S. 602, 623 (1989); Schmerber v. California, 384 U.S. 757, 770–771 (1966). And, {{as far as the}} record reveals, the officers might easily have secured the premises and sought a warrant permitting them to enter. See Illinois v. McArthur, 531 U.S. 326 (2001). Thus, the [...] "totality of the circumstances" [...] present <b>here</b> <b>do</b> not suffice to justify abandoning the Fourth Amendment's traditional hostility to police entry into a home without a warrant. I stress the totality of the circumstances, however, because, were the circumstances to change significantly, so should the result.|$|E
2500|$|The market {{also sells}} {{a number of}} species of plants which are native to Mexico and not {{commonly}} appreciated as ornamental plants. [...] Between this market and the flower market in Tenancingo, State of Mexico, a 2007 study identified 131 species from 93 genera and 42 families, with orchidaceae best represented. There are five main types: Briopsida, Pteridopsida, Pinopsida, Magnoliopsida and Liliopsida, with the last two accounting for 93% of all species. However, these 131 species are {{only a fraction of}} the 434 native Mexican species which have been identified as having ornamental potential. 95% of the species sold are on no or little risk of extinction or need of any special protection. Exceptions to this are Coryphantha elephantidens, Nymphaea odorata, Tillandsia imperialis, Campyloneurum phyllitidis, Cupressus lusitanic and Barkeria scandens. Many of these species are taken directly from the wild with little or no monitoring. However, the vast majority of the flower and plant species sold at the market are not native to Mexico, a situation reflected in the rest of the country. One reason for this is that most of the plant sellers <b>here</b> <b>do</b> not know the taxonomy of the native plants.|$|E

[...] The likes of fœtid, though superficially exceptional <b>here,</b> <b>do</b> belong in this category because the counting properly includes also final -e that has gone silent since Middle English (and therefore has been left out by some spellings) in those situations where speakers before the -e’s demise, such as Chaucer (who did not drop it in rhymes), {{would have had the}} -e as an intrinsic part of the word (rather than as just a suffix) — save for its regularly disappearing where followed with no pause by a word beginning with a vowel or sometimes /h/. [...] As less-circumstantial evidence (than this word's Modern short E) that it contained the final -e, consider both the spelling of , within [...] "It maketh to blister both handes, & feet, out of which issueth foetide, and stinckinge water." [...] (in a text dating to 1599) and the immediate ancestor of the word, lying between it and Latin’s fœtidus, -a, -um, namely, Anglo-Norman French fetide, attested 13th c.
