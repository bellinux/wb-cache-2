40|$|Abstract: <b>Jassids</b> (Hemiptera: Cicadellidae) are {{cell sap}} sucking insects of plants of {{economic}} importance. While sucking the cell sap they inject toxins into the plant body and cause yellowing and curling {{of leaves and}} flowers. Eventually, growth of the plant is retarded and flowering and fruiting bodies drop down. The sooty moulds affect photosynthesis and the yield of crops. Therefore, biodiversity of <b>Jassids</b> has been reported from Kolhapur district. In all, 22 species of <b>Jassids</b> belonging to the genera Deltocephalus...|$|R

The objectives of these studies were to control the pest by bio-intensive management methods and find an effective, safe and economical method/s for recommendation to the farmers. A Field experiment was carried to determine resistance or susceptibility of twenty genotypes of Bt-cotton against <b>Jassid</b> (nymph + adult) based on per seedling and per leaf population density count during 2009 and 2010 under field conditions. Laboratory experiments were carried out to study Physico-morphological and chemical plant characteristics with the objective to determine their effects on the population of <b>Jassid.</b> The results revealed that during preliminary field trials, the genotype Auriga- 213 showed maximum <b>Jassid</b> populations, whereas the genotype IR- 824 had zero population per seedling. Auriga- 101 and MNH- 886 possessed maximum <b>Jassid</b> populations per leaf (susceptible) whereas MG- 06 showed minimum (comparatively resistant). During a final screening trial, the genotypes Auriga- 101 and MNH- 886 proved to be susceptible, AA- 703 and MG- 06 appeared as comparatively resistant, while BT- 121 and CA- 12 were intermediate based on both per seedlings and per leaf population density counts of Jassids. The maximum population of <b>Jassid</b> (nymph + adult) per leaf was recorded on August 01, 2009 and August 16, 2010. There was only one peak in both the study years. The HPSIs (Host Plant Susceptibility Indices) on an average basis during both years showed that Auriga- 101 and MNH- 886 were susceptible, whereas AA- 703 and MG- 06 showed minimum HPSI and proved comparatively resistant, based per seedling and per population density counts of <b>Jassid</b> per leaf. The results revealed that minimum temperature during 2009 exerted a positive and significant (P < 0. 01) correlation with the <b>Jassid</b> population with a r-value of 0. 667 while during 2010 maximum temperature had negative and significant correlation (P < 0. 01) with the pest density on per leaf basis with a r-value of 0. 558. Relative humidity and rainfall during 2010 and on cumulative basis of both the study years 2009 and 2010 resulted in a significant (P < 0. 01) and positive correlation with the pest population. Multiple regression models reveal that minimum temperature during 2009 and 2010 and on cumulative basis of both the study years resulted in maximum impact, while maximum temperature during 2010 also exerted a reasonable contribution to the pest population. The results revealed that hair density on the plant's midrib, vein and lamina had a negative and significant correlation, length of hair on midrib and vein had a non significant correlation while thickness of leaf lamina had a positive and significant correlation with the <b>Jassid</b> population per leaf. Gossypol glands on midrib and vein showed positive and significant correlation, while on lamina they had a negative and significant effect.

40|$|Groundnut {{farmers in}} India apply so much {{insecticide}} that {{they end up}} inducing pest outbreaks. Their counterparts in Africa rarely use chemical sprays, and their crops suffer less damage from pests. Researchers at the International Crops Research Institute for the Semi-Arid Tropics (ICRISAT) in India {{have been looking at}} why African groundnut crops suffer little from pest damage. It seems that because Indian farmers spray at least seven times in the season the natural enemies of the pests are just not able to recolonize the crops as quickly as the pest. When the groundnut crop is quite young it is attacked by <b>jassids</b> and thrips. These cause only superficial damage, which results in no crop loss. But the farmers are encouraged to spray against the pest because the crop begins to look untidy and yellow. However, the spray not only kills the <b>jassids</b> and thrips but also the parasites of the groundnut leaf miner, the next major pest to appear. When ICRISAT withheld sprays in their fields they found that 70 - 80 % of the miners were parasitized and, in consequence they caused less crop damage. But if the parasites are killed, the miner can be very destructive. Later in the season the armyworm appears and starts to eat the leaves. Farmers do not realize that these pests can eat up to half the leaves without having any affect on yield. Even when farmers do spray, the costs incurred are not recovered by the increased yield. The last important pest of the season is Heliothis or pod borer. By this time any beneficial insects have been killed by all the previous spraying. ICRISAT plant breeders have now bred groundnut lines that are resistant to <b>jassids</b> and thrips. ICRISAT hopes that farmers using these new lines will not use sprays early in the season. If sprays are withheld at that time there is usually no need to spray later on, because the beneficial insects have been able to increase their populations. ICRISAT researchers hope that African farmers will be able to benefit from the results of these findings.
