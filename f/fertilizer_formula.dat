Mustard (Sinapis alba L.), oats (Avena sativa sp. L.), cucumber (Cucumis sativus L.) and cress (Lepidium sativum L.) were used as test plants species in the experiment. The toxicity tests were performed using a standard procedure of 72 h with the use of Phytotoxkit microbiotest and fertilizer application of 2. 5; 5 and 10 % (v/v).

30|$|The {{incorporation}} of humic complexes with nutritional action in plants, into the NPK granule, {{can be made}} through their incorporation either {{into one of the}} operational steps involved in the granule formation (I–III) or after granule stabilization in the conditioner drum. Although the latter option seems to be more adequate to prevent any decomposition of the molecules, many times it is not possible because it is very expensive due to the technology involved in it, and in many cases, the amount of humic mineral complexes needed to achieve intended results is too high to be applied by coating. In this sense, more than 1  % in the formula is normally not suitable to be applied as a coating. Then, regarding to the humic-derived molecules considered in this study, those related to micronutrients might be applied by coating (micronutrient concentration in compound fertilizer is rather low, mainly around 0.1  % referred to the micronutrient), while those involving major nutrients in <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formula,</b> such as macronutrients and even secondary nutrients (for instance, Ca and Mg), have to be applied in the granule mass during the granulation process.|$|E

40|$|Cocoa is {{globally}} {{the third}} agricultural commodity traded {{in terms of}} value. The cocoa world production is relatively stable since 2010, amounting to around 4. 5 million tonnes. Eight countries account for 90 % of the cocoa production, of which four West African countries. Under traditional cultivation practices, cocoa yields are poor {{with an average of}} ten fruits per cacao (Theobroma cacao L.), even though it has a potential to yield more than 100 fruits. As for most tree crops, the yields are depending on many factors, of which the more important are planting material, climate, cultural practices, and soil. Cacao is cultivated on many types of soil, and in various conditions, from agroforestry systems to full sun. Soil degradation and low soil fertility are among the main causes of low cocoa productivity. However, despite this inherent low fertility, most of the cocoa farmers do not use fertilizer because they are not well informed of the agricultural and fertilizers issues. Here we first review why fertilizers are used and how to optimize their effects, particularly farming practices and soil fertility management in full sun or shaded plantations. Secondly, we describe soil diagnosis and the foliar diagnosis, the two complementary approaches that were developed to assess the nutritional needs of cacao. The soil diagnosis provides a means to improve soil nutrient availabilities, while foliar diagnosis provides information on the cacao health. Third, we review the methods used to design <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formulae</b> and doses, and how they are calculated. Fertilizer inputs and mode of application are determined from the local conditions and farming practices. Finally, we review the effects of nutrients on the characteristics of the cocoa tree and cacao product. Finally, some current issues are discussed, {{such as the use of}} advising a single formula for a whole region or country and how to develop adoption of fertilizer by cocoa farmers.

40|$|Overuse of {{fertilizers}} in China causes {{environmental problems}} and high costs for farmers. In this paper {{we aim to}} identify entry points to improve fertilizer use efficiency in Taihu Basin, China. We use stochastic frontier analysis to estimate the technical and fertilizer use efficiency of rice production based on a survey held among 320 households in Wuxi, Zhenjiang and Changzhou, located upstream of Taihu Lake. Subsequently, Tobit model is applied to analyze factors influencing fertilizer use efficiency. The average technical efficiency and fertilizer use efficiency in this area in 2008 were 84. 2 % and 25. 4 % respectively. On average, rice production is thus efficient, but fertilizer use efficiency can be substantially improved. The results of the regression analyses explaining fertilizer use efficiency indicate that although extension services have stimulated the use of <b>formula</b> <b>fertilizer</b> in Taihu Basin, the use of <b>formula</b> <b>fertilizer</b> has not (yet) improved fertilizer use efficiency. Environmental awareness on water pollution and {{on the effect of}} fertilizers, off-farm income and a positive risk attitude have a significant positive effect on fertilizer use efficiency in Taihu Basin. Possessing a car or truck, labor intensity and the occurrence of disasters, on the other hand, have a significant negative effect on fertilizer use efficiency. Policies aimed at improving fertilizer use efficiency may therefore focus on increasing knowledge on the environment and fertilizer management, improving extension services and encouraging farmers to migrate or work off-farm...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to verify the kinetics of sorption and desorption of diuron in an Oxisol under application of biochar. The samples were collected in a field experiment conducted in randomized design blocks consisted of 2 base fertilization levels (0 and 400 kg&# 8729;ha&# 8722; 1 NPK 00 - 20 - 20 <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formula)</b> and 3 doses of biochar (0, 8 and 16 Mg&# 8729;ha&# 8722; 1). In the evaluation of sorption and desorption, Batch Equilibrium method was used. The kinetics of sorption and desorption of diuron, total organic carbon, fulvic acid, humic acid and humin, pH and partition coefficient to organic carbon were evaluated. The Freundlich isotherm was adjusted appropriately to describe diuron sorption kinetics in all the studied treatments. The application of biochar provided increment in the sorption (Kf) and reduction in the desorption of diuron in 64 and 44 %, respectively. This effect is attributed to the biochar contribution to the total organic carbon and C-humin and of these to diuron through hydrophobic interactions and hydrogen bonds. The positive correlation between the partition coefficient to organic carbon and Kf confirms the importance of soil organic compartment in the sorption of diuron. There was no competition of NPK fertilizer for the same sorption site of diuron. The increase and reduction in sorption and desorption, respectively, show that the application of biochar is an important alternative for the remediation of soil leaching of diuron, especially in sandy soils...|$|E
40|$|Farmers are {{increasingly}} required {{to justify their}} practices and to change their technical management approach due {{to the development of}} integrated production, new regulations and private standards. The feasibility of these changes can be assessed by analysing the practices of farmers. Here, we analysed the practices of farmers in apple orchards in the Mauguio-Lunel plain, France from an agronomic viewpoint, focusing on irrigation and N fertilizer. Our study was based on interviewing farmers about their practices and factors that influence their decisions. Interviews were supported by model-generated irrigation and fertilizer application schedules related to the considered plots. Fertilizer data recorded over a two-year period (2002 and 2003) were compared to data from interviews. Our results show that (1) irrigation practices were highly dependent on pest control practices; (2) chemical spraying against the codling moth [Cydia pomonella] strongly influenced irrigation frequency; (3) irrigation practices were dependent on irrigation devices; and (4) fertilizer application practices were highly dependent on the conceptions that farmers had about the role of N fertilizers. These conceptions were associated with timing, <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formula</b> and modulation rules. Based on data recorded by farmers over a two-year period, fertilizer application practices were highly variable. Likewise, these data also differed from data collected during interviews. Overall, our findings underline the importance of considering interactions between cultural practices and farmers' conceptions to understand farmers' practices. It also stressed the need to consider data recorded by the farmers themselves only as a partial source of information and to design better interviewing procedures with farmers...|$|E
40|$|The {{intensely}} weathered {{nature of}} soils used for cocoa production in Ghana, {{and the long}} history of nutrient depletion due to the absence of fertilization in this farming system have resulted in increased incidence of soil nutrient deficiencies in cocoa farms. The paper discusses the use of a soil diagnostic model combined with geographic information systems (GIS) to convert the current blanket fertilizer recommendations (0 N - 165 P. O, - 200 K. O kg ha 1) into a more effective recommendation that accounts for local land resources and the actual nutrient requirements of cocoa trees. A digital map of cocoa nutrient requirements was created based on climatic and soil groups/associations data. The results showed that about 95 % of the areas suitable for cocoa production are developed on only seven soil groups and four sub-groups (FAO classification). As inputs, 201 soil chemical analytic data were linked to land units to compute cocoa fertilizer formulae and doses. The number of fertilizer formulae was reduced to 32 using a fuzzy classification. Six fertilizer formulae would be sufficient to cover fertilizer recommendations for 52 % of the cocoa growing areas, while 16 fertilizer formulae will cover 90 % of the cocoa area. The current blanket <b>fertilizer</b> <b>formula</b> is only suitable for 6 % of the cocoa growing areas in Ghana. In western Ghana, where rainfall is over 1800 mm, the climatic influence is predominant and high leaching of soils is probably responsible for greater needs for P, than for K, Ca, and Mg. In eastern Ghana, where soils have high exchangeable cation levels and base saturation, soil diagnostic method suggested application of N fertilizers. This integrated method could provide precision agriculture techniques for cocoa farmers in Ghana, and beyond, in order to sustain yields on cocoa farms. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E

Likewise, in ES, about 51. 5 % fields were found severely deficient in S, and 30. 3 % were marginal, again necessitating the application of external S in about 81. 8 % of fields. In OL, about 63. 6 % of the fields were severely deficient in S, and 24. 2 % were marginal. From the study, therefore, across all 3 locations, 59. 0 % of studied fields were severely S deficient and 24 % were marginal.

After composting, the products were applied in the cultivation of Pak-choi to investigate the effects of different C/N ratios, different amounts of compost and successive culture on the plant growth and soil properties. Results show that the loss of nitrogen, overaged 55 %,is higher than the loss of carbon, 34 ﹪,during composting. The productivity of Pak-choi using organic fertilizers is higher than using chemical fertilizer, implies that the use of organic fertilizer in strong acid soil could certainly improve the plant productivity. The test of OF 1 in nitrogen efficiency is better than OF 2 and OF 3. This suggestes that a lower C/N organic fertilizer on higher rate of organic fertilizers used to increase up Pak-choi production [...] After the successive culture using compost as fertilizer increases soil P, K, and Mg contents and EC value, and thus increase the uptake of P, K and, Mg in plants. If the amount of compost is higher, the accumulations increase too, which will cause soil malnutrition after long terms of apply. According result, it is of great significance to adjustment the nutrient ratio in the organic fertilizer in order to meet the need of plant growth. 現代化的農業依賴高投入的化學肥料及合成農藥等化學資材來增加生產，然而由於不當之使用，造成土壤肥力及其理化性質日趨劣化，對地球環境造成負面影響。另則近來國人生活品質提升，環保意識抬頭，因此利用台灣每年所產生的大量有機廢棄物來發展有機農業實為必要。 本論文包括有機肥料小規模調製研究及小白菜盆栽驗證二部分，以研究有機栽培用小白菜有機肥料養分調配及施用量推算法。有機肥料調製研究部份，試驗材料以金針菇太空包及稻殼為主要碳源以大豆粕為主要氮源，堆肥化前材料中碳：氮：磷比例為 60 ： 4. 3 ： 1 (OF 1) ；為 90 ： 4. 3 ： 1 (OF 2) ；為 120 ： 4. 3 ： 1 (OF 3) 三種不同比例，進行堆肥化作用。盆栽驗證部份則以堆肥化後之三種有機肥料栽種小白菜，以探討不同碳氮比及相同堆肥不同施用量及連續種植對小白菜生長及土壤性質之影響。 有機肥料調製試驗結果發現以豆粕為氮源之堆肥，其氮量損失率偏高，而碳損失率偏低。氮成分總量損失率平均約為 55. 0 ﹪，碳成分總量損失率約為 34. 5 ﹪。可作為日後以此類氮源利用之參考。在盆栽試驗方面，在產量上有機肥料處理高於化學肥料，顯示在強酸性土壤有機肥料施用有增進小白菜生產之功效。在植體氮含量與吸收量來看，OF 1 在氮肥的效率上有佳於OF 2 及OF 3 的情況。高施用量處理(H) 無論在植體氮含量或植體氮吸收量方面都有高於低施用量(L) 之處理組，顯示調製高氮含量或調製低碳氮比之堆肥，能更有效提供小白菜生長所需。 有機肥料處理具有改善土壤酸性，增加土壤有機質含量之功效，但有機肥料連用後造成土壤中磷、鉀、及鎂的累積，造成EC的逐次上升，此外磷、鉀、鎂的累積，亦造成植體中磷、鉀、鎂含量的提升。且有隨施用量之增加而增加，在鉀鎂比、鈣鎂比、及鉀鈣比方面，土壤與植體中之比例呈一線性相關，達極顯著，長期施用後將造成土壤養分的失調，進而影響作物生長，因此調整有機肥料中之養分比例，使其養分的釋放能配合小白菜的生長，確有其必要性。中文摘要…………………………………………….
