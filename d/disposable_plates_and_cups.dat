50|$|Bars {{were the}} first {{businesses}} to reopen in many areas; two remained open in the French Quarter even during {{the worst of the}} storm and the official mandatory evacuation. Most other businesses, such as gas stations, appliance stores, and supermarkets, followed somewhat later as they required more work before they could reopen. Three months after the storm, most open restaurants were serving food and drink in <b>disposable</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>cups</b> because of the shortage of dishwashers. Despite many restaurants offering wages double pre-Katrina levels for dishwashers, there were few takers as untrained laborers were able to make more money in demolition- and reconstruction-related industries. Ten months later, things had improved, though there were still labor shortages in many service industries.|$|E
40|$|Recently great {{attention}} from {{industry has been}} focused on biodegradable polyesters derived from renewable resources. In particular, PLA has attracted great interest due to its high strength and high modulus and a good biocompatibility, however its brittleness and low heat distortion temperature (HDT) restrict its wide application. On the other hand, Poly(butylene succinate) (PBS) is a biodegradable polymer with a low tensile modulus but characterized by a high flexibility, excellent impact strength, good thermal and chemical resistance. In this work the two aliphatic biodegradable polyesters PBS and PLA were selected with the aim to obtain a biodegradable material for the industry of plastic cups and plates. PBS was also blended with a thermoplastic starch. Talc was also added to the compounds because of its low cost and its effectiveness in increasing the modulus and the HDT of polymers. The compounds were obtained by melt compounding in a single screw extruder and the rheological, mechanical and thermal properties were investigated. The properties of the two compounds were compared and {{it was found that the}} values of the tensile modulus and elongation at break measured for the PBS/PLA/Talc compound make it interesting for the production of <b>disposable</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>cups.</b> In terms of thermal resistance the compounds have HDTs high enough to contain hot food or beverages. The PLA/PBS/Talc compound can be, then, considered as biodegradable substitute for polystyrene for the production of <b>disposable</b> <b>plates</b> <b>and</b> <b>cups</b> for hot food and beverages...|$|E

40|$|Everyday Millions of <b>disposable</b> <b>plates,</b> <b>cups</b> <b>and</b> {{utensils}} {{are used}} in fast food establishments, cafeterias, restaurants and homes worldwide. These single-use disable <b>plates,</b> <b>cup</b> <b>and</b> utensils, when of polystyrene or plastic, do not biodegrade and decompose like fruit, vegetables or meat; they only breakdown into smaller pieces on a physical level. This lack of decomposition means that these products persist and accumulate in landfills consuming the available space and contaminate the surrounding area. With an ever growing global population, the disposable waste generated annually is increasing and landfills worldwide are rapidly filling. Therefore, more landfills are needed sooner but they are expensive to create, they consume {{a large amount of}} usable space and can harm the environment. In order to reduce the dependence on landfills, the waste can be diverted through recycling programs, reducing human consumption and purchasing reusable and/or compostable materials. These methods of waste reduction would be implemented at the municipal level but {{it would be possible to}} change provincial and state legislation so that municipalities would be required to do so rather than of their own volition. If initiated worldwide than the amount of waste produced by humans would be greatly reduced and the dependence on landfills would decrease...|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} the results of heat and compression effects on moisture content and water absorption properties in the manufacturing of <b>disposable</b> <b>plate</b> made from Pineapple Leaf Fiberbased material (PALF). The plate was made of PALF and sugarcane bagasse waste as an alternative to polystyrenes, designed to promote the green technology effort on food packaging material. Two different specimens were produced with different compositions of PALF/sugarcane bagasse, series N 2 T 8 as a 20 % Pineapple leaf fiber and 80 % sugarcane bagasse and series N 8 T 2 as an 80 % Pineapple leaf fiber and 20 % sugarcane bagasse. The specimens were produced using a hot press machine set at compressing temperatures of 50 °C, 100 °C and 150 °C with constant pressure of 0. 024 MPa for 10 minutes. Moisture content and water absorption tests were carried out on the specimens to determine the moisture content and water absorption properties. The best water absorption was obtained for specimen N 8 T 2 because PALF/sugarcane potential to hydroscopic and water resistance. This range of properties is expected to be good enough for the requirement of <b>disposable</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> it has the potential as a suitable raw material for strength and lightweight in the manufacturing of <b>disposable</b> <b>plate...</b>|$|R

30|$|Normally a {{constant}} shear stress is specified. The disadvantage {{is that the}} resulting rotational speed decreases continuously as the viscosity increases. The rate of deformation would therefore no longer be constant. This, however, is decisive for the comparability {{of the effect of}} shear on the test specimen [15]. Therefore the shear rate is kept constant. The measuring temperature is kept constant and, {{with the aid of a}} disposable measuring system, consisting of a <b>disposable</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> a <b>disposable</b> dish, it is possible to measure several specimens without having to go to the effort of removing the hardened adhesive. The time-dependent viscosity function is evaluated as the result. Here, the time t_s (start time) when the curve begins to rise is of special interest. Likewise, the slope of this curve can be compared for the respective substrate temperatures.|$|R

50|$|In banana leaf meals, {{white rice}} (or {{parboiled}} rice in authentic South Indian restaurants) is {{served on a}} banana leaf {{with an assortment of}} vegetables, pickles, papadum and other regional condiments (usually sour, salty or spicy). The banana leaf acts as a <b>disposable</b> <b>plate</b> <b>and</b> it in itself is not consumed. The choice of banana leaves is mainly due to the broad leaves {{as well as to the}} ubiquity of the plant in South India. Typically, only vegetarian gravy (e.g. sambar) will be served on the rice as it is meant to be a traditional vegetarian dish. However, sometimes boiled eggs, curried or fried meat or seafood are served as well. Traditionally, there will be two servings of rice with the first being served with gravy, side dishes and condiments whilst the second serving will be just rice with curd as a palate cleanser.|$|R
