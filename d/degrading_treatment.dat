Metals are important environmental pollutants, since they are widely used during human activities, and following release are not either chemically or biologically <b>degraded.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of acute poisoning in humans caused by potentially toxic metals has employed complexation agents such as ethylenediaminetetraacetic acid (EDTA) or -aminoacids.

40|$|Establishment of {{riparian}} buff ers is an eff ective {{method for}} reducing nutrient input to streams. However, the underlying biogeochemical processes {{are not fully}} understood. Th e objective of this 4 -yr {{study was to examine}} the eff ects of riparian zone restoration on soil N cycling mechanisms in a mountain pasture previously degraded by cattle. Soil inorganic N pools, fl uxes, and transformation mechanisms were compared across the following experimental treatments: (i) a restored area with vegetation regrowth; (ii) a degraded riparian area with simulated eff ects of continued grazing by compaction, vegetation removal, and nutrient addition (+N); and (iii) a degraded riparian area with simulated compaction and vegetation removal only (-N). Soil solution NO 3 – concentrations and fl uxes of inorganic N in overland fl ow were> 90 % lower in the restored treatment relative to the <b>degraded</b> (+N) <b>treatment.</b> Soil solution NO 3 concentrations decreased more rapidly in the restored treatment relative to the degraded (-N) following cattle (Bos taurus) exclusion. Mineralization and nitrifi cation rates in the restored treatment were similar to the <b>degraded</b> (-N) <b>treatment</b> and, on average, 75 % lower than in the <b>degraded</b> (+N) <b>treatment.</b> Nitrogen trace gas fl uxes indicated that restoration increased the relative importance of denitrifi cation, relative to nitrifi cation, as a pathway by which N is diverted from the receiving stream to the atmosphere. Changes in soil nutrient cycling mechanisms following restoration of the degraded riparian zone were primarily driven by cessation of N inputs. Th e recovery rate, however, was infl uenced by the rate of vegetation regrowth...|$|R

The states themselves have undertaken long-term social changes through the protection of the human rights.

40|$|Hantavirus {{glycoprotein}} precursor (GPC) is posttranslationally cleaved {{into two}} glycoproteins, Gn and Gc. Cells transfected with plasmids expressing either GPC or both Gn and Gc revealed that Gn is posttranslationally <b>degraded.</b> <b>Treatment</b> of cells with the autophagy inhibitors 3 -methyladenine, LY- 294002, orWortmanin rescued Gn degradation, suggesting that Gn is degraded by the host autophagy machinery. Confocal microscopic imaging showed that Gn is targeted to autophagosomes for degradation by an unknownmechanism. Examination of autophagy markers LC 3 -I and LC 3 -II demonstrated that both Gn expression and Sin Nombre hantavirus (SNV) infection induce autophagy in cells. To delineate whether induction of autophagy and clearance of Gn {{play a role}} in the virus replication cycle, we downregulated autophagy genes BCLN- 1 and ATG 7 using small interfering RNA (siRNA) andmonitored virus replication over time. These studies revealed that inhibition of host autophagy machinery inhibits Sin Nombre virus replication in cells, suggesting that autophagic clearance of Gn is required for efficient virus replication. Our studies provide mechanistic insights into viral pathogenesis and reveal that SNV exploits the host autophagy machinery to de-crease the intrinsic steady-state levels of an important viral component for efficient replication in host cells. The ubiquitin-proteasome and autophagy-lysosome pathwaysare the two main routes for the clearance of proteins and or-ganelles in most eukaryotic cells.
