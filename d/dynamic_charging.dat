The carbon-based materials are also natural choices for stretchable supercapacitors, with proper structural engineering to impart stretchability to the devices.

Previous work in this area using FZG gear wear rig and pin-on-disc tribometers demonstrated that ‘precursor’ charge events may be detected prior to the onset of scuffing. Possible charging mechanisms associated with the precursor events were identified as tribocharging, surface charge variation, exo-emissions, and debris generation. This article details tests carried out to investigate the contribution of wear debris. Tests were carried out on a modified pin-on-disc rig using a sliding point contact and fitted with electrostatic sensors, one of which monitored the disc wear track and the other the disc surface just outside the wear track. Baseline tests used mild wear conditions with no seeded particles added to the entrained lubricant, whereas the high wear tests entrained seeded steel particles into the contact to promote wear. The wear debris produced <b>dynamic</b> <b>charge</b> features and the overall charging activities are directly related to the wear rate (i. e. charging levels increase with increasing wear rate).

40|$|ABSTRACT: Understanding the <b>dynamic</b> <b>charge</b> {{storage in}} {{nanoporous}} electrodes with room-temperature ionic liquid electrolytes {{is essential for}} optimizing them to achieve supercapacitors with high energy and power densities. Herein, we report coarse-grained molecular dynamics simulations of the cyclic voltammetry of supercapacitors featuring subnan-ometer pores and model ionic liquids. We show that the cyclic charging and discharging of nanopores are governed by the interplay between the external field-driven ion transport and the sloshing dynamics of ions inside of the pore. The ion occupancy along the pore length depends strongly on the scan rate and varies cyclically during charging/discharging. Unlike that at equilibrium conditions or low scan rates, charge storage at high scan rates is dominated by counterions while the contribution by co-ions is marginal or negative. These observations help explain the perm-selective charge storage observed experimentally. We clarify the mechanisms underlying these dynamic phenomena and quantify their effects on {{the efficiency of the}} <b>dynamic</b> <b>charge</b> storage in nanopores...|$|R

Therefore, the work presented in this paper focuses on the experimental performance testing of two-stage reciprocating compressors using air as the working fluid during the <b>dynamic</b> <b>charging</b> of a tank. A new test stand has been designed and built to conduct the dynamic compressor performance tests. Performance tests have been conducted from an initial pressure of 101. 3 kPa to a final tank pressure of 3600 kPa. To achieve the final pressure of 3600 kPa, two hermetic reciprocating compressors are used in series. Due {{to the nature of the}} charging process, initially only the first stage compressor is activated until the tank pressure reaches a level that requires activation of the second stage compressor. Â Along with the experimental effort, a simulation model to predict the compressor dynamic performance has been developed. In this model, the initial clearance factors of the two compressors can be calculated based on available compressor maps. These clearance factors are then used as inputs to the dynamic model. The entire charging process can be simulated to provide the compressor performance data as the function of time.

40|$|As {{emission}} regulations {{getting more}} stringent {{and the demand}} for fossil fuel growing, it is crucial to develop advanced technologies for internal combustion engine to lower emissions and fuel. ^ Strategies such as diesel oxidation catalysts (DOC) for UHC, diesel particulate filters (DPF) for PM, and selective catalytic reduction (SCR) for NOx have been developed and implemented to convert harmful emissions to innocuous species. However, the efficiencies of these after-treatment systems are heavily temperature dependent. ^ Heavy-duty over-the-road trucks require periodic active diesel particulate filter regeneration to clean the filter of stored particulate matter. These events require sustained temperatures between 500 and 600 °C to complete the regeneration process. Engine operation during typical 65 mile/hour highway cruise conditions (1200 rpm/ 7. 6 bar) results in temperatures of approximately 350 °C, and can reach approximately 420 °C with late fuel injection. This necessitates hydrocarbon fueling of a diesel oxidation catalyst or burner located upstream of the diesel particulate filter to reach the required regeneration temperatures. These strategies require increased fuel consumption, and the presence of a fuel-dosed oxidation catalyst (or burner) between the engine and particulate filter. This work experimentally demonstrates that, at the highway cruise condition, deactivation of valve motions and fuel injection for two or three (of six) cylinders can instead be used to reach engine outlet temperatures of 520 - 570 °C, a 170 - 220 °C increase compared to normal operation. This is primarily a result of a reduction in the air-to-fuel ratio realized by reducing the displaced cylinder volume through cylinder deactivation. ^ HDFTP drive cycle has {{more than half of the}} fuel consumed at high speed/high load conditions.
