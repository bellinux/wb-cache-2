40|$|International audienceExact closed-form {{solutions}} are derived that completely characterize the effective {{behavior of a}} composite material made of elastic-perfectly plastic parallel plane layers perfectly bonded together. The derivation is framed within a rigorous theory of homogenization for elastoplastic composites, {{and based on the}} fundamental fact that the in-plane part of the strain tensor and the out-of-plane part of the stress tensor are uniform throughout the composite provided no free-edge effects occur. The obtained expressions are coordinate-free and valid in the general anisotropic case. As an example, a layered composite material with <b>isotropic</b> <b>constituents</b> is examined in detail...|$|R
40|$|In this work, {{based on}} the {{periodic}} unfolding homogenization technique, the limiting equations modelling the behaviour of three-dimensional magneto-electro-elastic periodic structures are rigorously established. The local problems and the corresponding homogenized coefficients of the elastic, dielectric, magnetic permittivity, piezoelectric, piezomagnetic and magneto-electric (ME) tensors are explicitly described. The homogenization model is exemplified for laminated composites and a unified general formula for all effective properties of periodic multilaminated magneto-electro-elastic composites is obtained. This formula is applied to investigate the global behaviour for the important case of transversely <b>isotropic</b> <b>constituents</b> and any finite number of layers in each periodic cell. Examples that provide theoretical evidence {{of the presence of}} both a product property and the ME effect are given. 1...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe overall {{properties}} of a binary elastic periodic fiber-reinforced composite, with transversely <b>isotropic</b> <b>constituents</b> in an anti-plane-strain deformation state, are studied {{here for a}} cell periodicity of square type. This analysis considers four different orientations of the axis of transverse isotropy of constituents {{with respect to the}} direction of fibers. Each case is characterized by very simple closed-form expressions for the effective coefficients, which were obtained using the asymptotic homogenization method. Local problems defined on a periodic square unit cell are solved using Weierstrassian and Natanzon’s functions and perturbation theory relative to small anisotropy. In the isotropic limit, comparison with rigorous bounds and some well-known mixing rules are made. Also, comparisons with finite element calculations show that the derived closed-form formulae provide excellent results even for large anisotropy...|$|R
40|$|In this work, we {{developed}} an improved shear lag model {{to investigate the}} load transfer characteristics of three-phase nanocomposite which is reinforced with microscale fibers augmented with carbon nanotubes on their circumferential surfaces. The shear lag model accounts for (i) radial and axial deformations of different transversely <b>isotropic</b> <b>constituents,</b> (ii) thermomechanical loads on the representative volume element (RVE), and (iii) staggering effect of adjacent RVEs. The results from the current newly developed shear lag model are validated with the finite element simulations and found {{to be in good}} agreement. Our study reveals that the reduction in the maximum value of the axial stress in the fiber and the interfacial shear stress along its length become more pronounced in the presence of applied thermomechanical loads on the staggered RVEs. The existence of shear tractions along the RVE length plays {{a significant role in the}} load transfer characteristics and cannot be ignored...|$|R
40|$|This work {{presents}} a systematic study of thermo-mechanical behaviour of macroscopically isotropic heterogeneous materials with anisotropic constituents based on microstructural modelling. As an example, lamellar cast iron is considered, whose microstructure {{is composed of}} spatially interconnected anisotropic graphite particles embedded in ferrite/pearlite matrix. The complex three-dimensional microstructure of lamellar cast iron is represented here by an idealized unit cell model which captures in a simplified manner the main morphological features of the material. The thermal, mechanical and thermo-mechanical response of the unit cell incorporating the highly anisotropic phase is analysed {{by comparing the results}} for the equivalent unit cell with the <b>isotropic</b> <b>constituents</b> and considering both fully fixed and loose interface conditions. The major conclusion drawn from these analyses is that the anisotropy of microstructural phases plays crucial role in determining both the effective as well as local response of the material. The simplifying isotropy assumption leads to significantly different predictions at both scales...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMicrostructures {{possessing}} local spherical anisotropy {{are considered}} in this paper. An {{example is a}} spherulitic polymer which can be modelled by an assemblage of spheres of all sizes in which a radial direction in every sphere is an axis of local transverse isotropy. Our purpose is to construct effectively isotropic microstructures, with spherically anisotropic and thermoelastic constituents, whose effective bulk modulus, thermal stress and specific heat can be exactly determined. The basic microstructure for which this is achieved in the present paper is the nested composite sphere assemblage of Milgrom and Shtrikman (J. Appl. Phys. 66 (1989) 3429) which was originally formulated for <b>isotropic</b> <b>constituents,</b> in the settings of conductivity and coupled fields with scalar potentials. Here, we allow the phases of this microstructure to be spherically thermoelastic with a symmetry class which can be trigonal, tetragonal, transversely isotropic, cubic or isotropic {{with respect to a}} local spherical coordinate system. A rich class of new exact results for two-phase composites and polycrystals are obtained. (C) 2004 Elsevier Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R
40|$|It {{is shown}} here that {{interstellar}} diamond and SiC {{were incorporated into}} all groups of chondrite meteorites. Abundances rapidly go to zero with increasing metamorphic grade, suggesting that metamorphic destruction {{is responsible for the}} apparent absence of these grains in most chondrites. In unmetamorphosed chondrites, abundances normalized to matrix content are similar for different classes. Diamond samples from chondrites of different classes have remarkably similar noble-gas constants and <b>isotropic</b> compositions, although <b>constituent</b> diamonds may have come from many sources. SiC seems to be more diverse, partly because grains are large enough to measure individually, but average characteristics seem to be similar from meteorite to meteorite. These observations suggest that various classes of chondritic meteorites sample the same solar system-wide reservoir of interstellar grains...|$|R
40|$|One of {{the main}} factors {{responsible}} for effective anisotropy of seismic attenuation is interbedding of thin attenuative layers with different properties. Here, we apply Backus averaging to obtain the complex stiffness matrix for an effective medium formed by an arbitrary number of anisotropic, attenuative constituents. Unless the intrinsic attenuation is uncommonly strong, the effective velocity function {{is controlled by the}} real-valued stiffnesses (i. e., is independent of attenuation) and can be determined from the known equations for purely elastic media. Analysis of effective attenuation is more complicated because the attenuation parameters are influenced by coupling between the real and imaginary parts of the stiffness matrix. The main focus of this work is on effective VTI (transversely isotropic with a vertical symmetry axis) models that include <b>isotropic</b> and VTI <b>constituents.</b> Assuming that the stiffness contrasts, as well as the intrinsic velocity and attenuation anisotropy, are weak, we develop explicit first-order (linear) and secondorder (quadratic) approximations for the attenuation-anisotropy parameters ɛ...|$|R
40|$|Advanced fibers used to {{reinforce}} composite materials exhibit complicated morphology. Typically, the fiber {{consists of a}} cylindrical core embedded in a cladding region followed by a distinct interface zone separating the fiber system from the matrix region. In addition, the cladding region itself often consists of subregions which can be identified as more or less distinct layers. According to the simplest micromechanical models these coaxial layers {{are assumed to be}} isotropic and homogeneous. At low frequencies when the acoustic wavelength is much larger than the radius of the fiber, such a composite fiber exhibits significant anisotropy of transversely symmetric nature manifested by higher axial stiffness relative to the radial one. This macroscopic anisotropy is caused by the coaxial structure and the possibly imperfect interfaces between the layers. The main goal {{of this study was to}} determine whether this structural anisotropy produced by the presence of microscopically <b>isotropic</b> and homogeneous <b>constituents</b> is sufficient to account for all of the macroscopic anisotropy observed in real fibers or, in addition, microscopic anisotropy caused by some texturing in the constituents themselves is needed to properly model the fiber at ultrasonic frequencies. Apparent texturing in the constituents can be caused by either real microscopic anisotropy due to preferred crystallographic orientation of grain growth during manufacturing or by additional structural anisotropy due to strong radial inhomogeneity in the material composition, e. g., increasing carbon content in the silicon carbide caladding...|$|R
40|$|It is {{well known}} that Biot theory (Biot, 1956; 1962) of porous-media {{acoustics}} ignores all wave-induced flow at mesoscopic scales, i. e. scales greater than the grain size but less that the wavelength. Biot?s theory can not explain high level attenuation observed in natural porous media such as fluid-filled sands or sandstone over the seismic frequency range (10 - 200 Hz). This attenuation is successfully described by the mesoscopic heterogeneity models (e. g., Gurevich and Lopatnikov, 1995; Gelinksy and Shapiro, 1997; Johnson, 2001). By applying the volume averaging theory to the local Biot poroelastic law, Pride an Berryman (2003 a,b) developed the double-porosity, dual permeability (DPDP) model It gives a theoretical framework, including the field equations governing the linear acoustics of composites with two <b>isotropic</b> porous <b>constituents</b> (phase 1 and phase 2), to model acoustic wave propagation through heterogeneous porous structures. Under the assumption that phase 2 is entirely embedded in phase 1, the double-porosity theory is reduced to the effective Biot theory with the complex frequency-dependent elastic moduli in which the internal mesoscopic flow is incorporated. This theory provides good agreement with measurements of attenuation over the seismic and ultrasonic frequency bands (Pride et al., 2004). In this paper, the analytical transient solution and dispersion characteristics for the double-porosity model are obtained over the whole frequency range for a homogeneous medium. A homogeneous poro-viscoacoustic model is constructed and analytically solved to approximate the double porosity model. The comparison between the results of the two models shows the likely validity and limitations of numerical solutions using a poro-viscoacoustic model to represent a double porosity medium in the heterogeneous case. Our calculations show that the dissipation by local mesoscopic flow of the double porosity model is very hard to fit over the entire frequency range by a single Zener element. We choose the relaxation function which just approximates the dispersion behaviour of the double porosity model around the source centre frequency. It is shown that if the frequency is much lower than the peak attenuation frequency of the double porosity model, then wave propagation can be well described by the poro-viscoacoustic model with a single Zener element. For most water-filled sandstones having a double porosity structure, this holds true across the seismic frequency range. L. Xu, S. Greenhalgh and B. Zhou[URL]...|$|R
40|$|In modern {{engineering}} applications, multilayered {{structures are}} extensively used {{due to the}} added advantage of combining physical, mechanical, and thermal properties of different materials. Many of these applications require a detailed knowledge of transient temperature and heat-flux distribution within the component layers. Both analytical and numerical techniques {{may be used to}} solve such problems. Nonetheless, numerical solutions are preferred and prevalent in practice, due to either unavailability or higher mathematical complexity of the corresponding exact solutions. Rather limited use of analytical solutions should not diminish their merit over numerical ones; since exact solutions, if available, provide an insight into the governing physics of the problem, which is typically missing in any numerical solution. Moreover, analyzing closed-form solutions to obtain optimal design options for any particular application of interest is relatively simpler. In addition, exact solutions find their applications in validating and comparing various numerical algorithms to help improve computational efficiency of computer codes that currently rely on numerical techniques. Although multilayer heat conduction problems have been studied in great detail and various solution methods including orthogonal and quasi-orthogonal expansion technique, Laplace transform method, Green’s function approach, finite integral transform technique are readily available; there is a continued need to develop and explore novel methods to solve problems for which exact solutions still do not exist. One such problem is to determine exact unsteady temperature distribution in polar coordinates with multiple layers in the radial direction. Numerous applications involving multilayer cylindrical geometry require evaluation of temperature distribution in complete disk-type. One typical example is a nuclear fuel rod, which consists of concentric layers of different materials and often subjected to asymmetric boundary conditions. Moreover, several other applications including multilayer insulation materials, double heat-flux conductimeter, typical laser absorption calorimetry experiments, cryogenic systems, and other cylindrical building structures would benefit from such analytical solutions. Then, object of the present thesis is to derive new thermo-elastic solutions for composite materials constituted by multilayered spheres and cylinders under time-dependent boundary conditions. These solutions are utilized for several engineering applications and we report some applications in last analyze chapters of present thesis. In follows, we will described the contents of thesis. In first chapters are reported the thermo-mechanical foundations and a summary of the formulation of thermo-elastic problems for isotropic material. In chapter X it is developed an analytical approach to find exact elastic solutions for multilayered cylinder composed of <b>isotropic</b> <b>constituents</b> and determining the analytical response in terms of displacements and stresses for all the De Saint Venant (DSV) load conditions, that is axial force, torque, pure bending and combined bending moment and shear actions. Successively, {{on the basis of the}} found analytical solutions, a homogenization procedure is adopted in order to obtain the overall constitutive elastic laws for multilayered cylinder, in this way deriving the exact one-dimensional model characterized by the axial stiffness, flexural rigidity, shear deformability and torsional stiffness relating beam’s generalized stresses and strains. By playing with the Poisson ratios of adjacent phases, some counterintuitive and engineering relevant results are shown with reference to unexpected increasing of overall stiffness of multilayered cylinder. In chapter XI it is presented an analytical elastic solution for multilayered cylinder constituted by transversally-isotropic n-phases, under radial pressure, axial force and torque. Then, by utilizing the homogenization theory, it is obtained the overall elastic stiffness of the equivalent homogeneous transversally-isotropic solid, establishing the constitutive elastic laws relating stresses and strains. In chapter XII it is developed an analytical approach to find exact elastic solutions for multilayered cylinder subjected to axial force, constituted by n orthotropic cylindrical hollow phases and a central core, each of them modelled as homogeneous and cylindrically anisotropic material. In chapter XIII it is reported an analytical solution for multilayered cylinder composed by hollow cylindrical monoclinic phases under axial force and torsion. In this chapter, we consider the chiral structure for each cylindrical layer. In particular the composite material is constituted by two hollow cylindrical monoclinic phases. The cylindrical monoclinic elastic property of multilayered cylinder is obtained by the particular chiral structure. In fact, we consider the two hollow phases constructed by right-handed and left-handed spiral helices whose long axes are all parallel. These helical spirals may be either touching or separated by a matrix material and are composed by elastic orthotropic material. In chapters XIV, XV, XVI are reported some thermo-elastic solution, for hollow cylinders, hollow spheres and plates, respectively. In chapter XVII we consider a steady-state thermo-elastic problem of multilayered cylinder with finite length. The thermal and mechanical loads applied on the cylinder are axisymmetric in the hoop direction and are constant in the axial direction. In order to obtain analytical solutions for temperature, displacements, and stresses for the two-dimensional thermo-elastic problem, the cylinder is assumed to be composed of n fictitious layers in the radial direction. The material properties of each layer are assumed as homogeneous. In chapter XVIII are determined the displacements, strains, and stresses from the general analytical solution of multilayered sphere composed by an arbitrary number of layers constituted by materials with generic modulus of elasticity, thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity. Material properties are assumed to be temperature-independent and homogeneous in each layer. The multilayered sphere is considered as a classical composite material whose properties abruptly vary from one hollow sphere to the other. In chapter XIX are presented the most important standard fire curves: ISO 834, External fire curve, hydrocarbon fire curve, ASM 119 and parametric fire curves (European Parametric fire curves, Swedish Fire Curves, BFD curves, CE 534 curve). Moreover in this chapter are reported the mechanical and thermal properties of steel and concrete at elevate temperature. In chapters XX and XXI, the one-dimensional quasi-static uncoupled thermo-elastic problem of a multilayered sphere and multilayered cylinder, with time-dependent boundary conditions are considered, respectively. The body forces and heat generation vanish. In both cases, the analytical solution is obtained by applying the method of separation of variables. In chapter XXII it is studied a spherical tank methane gas-filled exposed to fire characterized by hydrocarbon fire curve. The interaction between spherical tank and internal gas is studied. By applying a suitable simplified hypothesis on the mechanics of problem, we determine the analytical thermo-elastic solution for spherical tank. By applying the solution obtained, the increasing graded temperature of gas methane in spherical tank is determined. Finally, a numerical example is reported for a spherical tank exposed to hydrocarbon fire, showing the collapse temperature. In chapter XXIII, an industrial insulated pipeline is modelled as multilayered cylinder, subjected to mechanical and thermal loads. By using a multi-layered approach based on the theory of laminated composites, the solutions for temperature, heat flux, displacements, and thermal/mechanical stresses are presented. By applying the analytical thermo-elastic solution reported in Chapter XVII, a parametric analysis is conducted in order to analyze the mechanical behaviour of an industrial insulated pipeline composed by three phases: steel, insulate coating, and outer layer made of polyethylene to protect the insulation. In this model, parametric analyses are conducted by varying the Young’s modulus, Poisson’s ratio, thermal conductivity and linear thermal expansion coefficient of insulate coating. The analysis shows the maximum Hencky von Mises’s equivalent stress in steel phase and in insulate coating. Finally, it is presented a numerical example by considering three types of materials for insulate coating: (1) Expanded Polyurethane; (2) Laminate glass; (3) Syntatic foam. In chapter XXIV it is analyzed a cylindrical concrete specimen under axial force within Fibre Polymeric Reinforcing sheets. The elastic solutions found in Chapter XII are here extended to the post-elastic range. The evolution of the stress field when the core phase is characterized by an Intrinsic Curve or Schleicher-like elastic-plastic response with associate flow rule and the cylindrically orthotropic hollow phase obeys to is shown the elastic-brittle Tsai-Hill anisotropic yield criterion. The choice of these post-elastic behaviours is suggested by experimental evidences reported in literature for these materials, as well as the cylindrical orthotropy of the hollow phase intrinsically yields to consider several perfectly bonded FRP layers as an equivalent one, interpreting their overall mechanical response by invoking the theory of homogenization and the mechanics of composites. At the end, a numerical example application to cylindrical concrete specimens reinforced with Carbon FRP is presented, by furnishing a predictive formula – derived from the previously obtained analytical solutions - for estimating the overall collapse mechanism, the concrete ultimate compressive strength and the confining pressure effect. The results are finally compared with several experimental literature data, highlighting the very good agreement between the theoretical predictions and the laboratory measurements. In chapter XXV it is reported an analytical thermo-elastic solution in closed form for bi-layer hollow cylinder subjected to time-dependent boundary conditions. It is assumed that each hollow cylinder is composed by a homogeneous and thermo-isotropic material, characterized by different mechanical and thermal parameters, i. e. modulus of elasticity, thermal expansion coefficient and thermal conductivity. Moreover, these material properties in each hollow cylinder are assumed to be temperature-independent. In other words, the bi-layer hollow cylinder is considered as a classical composite material whose properties abruptly vary from one hollow cylinder to the other. In particular, it is obtained a new analytical solution for a bi-layer hollow cylinder, constituted by two phases: Ceramic () and Metal () subjected to heat flux on inner surface...|$|R
