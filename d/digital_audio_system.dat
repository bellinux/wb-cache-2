Regal stated that they are planning on making 25 of their IMAX locations available for the screening of the film when it {{opened to the public}} on 28 October. Dick Westerling, head of marketing and advertising for Regal, stated that the film was selected due to its strong ticket sales. IMAX Corporation and Sony stated that the film will open in digital IMAX theatres. and that the limited IMAX release will be played domestically during [...] "evening show times" [...] in 96 IMAX digital theaters, and additionally the movie will be played in 27 of the company's international digital locations.

50|$|Analog {{audio signals}} are {{susceptible}} to noise and distortion, due to the innate characteristics of electronic circuits and associated devices.

It is therefore generally possible to have an entirely error-free <b>digital</b> <b>audio</b> <b>system</b> in which no noise or distortion is introduced between conversion to digital format, and conversion back to analog.|$|E
