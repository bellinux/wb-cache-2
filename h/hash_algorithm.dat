25|$|Systems {{that use}} {{passwords}} for authentication {{must have some}} way to check any password entered to gain access. If the valid passwords are simply stored in a system file or database, an attacker who gains sufficient access to the system will obtain all user passwords, giving the attacker access to all accounts on the attacked system, and possibly other systems where users employ the same or similar passwords. One way to reduce this risk is to store only a cryptographic hash of each password instead of the password itself. Standard cryptographic hashes, such as the Secure <b>Hash</b> <b>Algorithm</b> (SHA) series, are very hard to reverse, so an attacker who gets hold of the hash value cannot directly recover the password. However, knowledge of the hash value lets the attacker quickly test guesses offline. Password cracking programs are widely available that will test {{a large number of}} trial passwords against a purloined cryptographic hash.|$|E
2500|$|Cryptographic hash {{functions}} are a third type of cryptographic algorithm. They take {{a message of}} any length as input, and output a short, fixed length hash, {{which can be used}} in (for example) a digital signature. For good hash functions, an attacker cannot find two messages that produce the same hash. MD4 is a long-used hash function that is now broken; MD5, a strengthened variant of MD4, is also widely used but broken in practice. The US National Security Agency developed the Secure <b>Hash</b> <b>Algorithm</b> series of MD5-like hash functions: SHA-0 was a flawed algorithm that the agency withdrew; SHA-1 is widely deployed and more secure than MD5, but cryptanalysts have identified attacks against it; the SHA-2 family improves on SHA-1, but it isn't yet widely deployed; and the US standards authority thought it [...] "prudent" [...] from a security perspective to develop a new standard to [...] "significantly improve the robustness of NIST's overall <b>hash</b> <b>algorithm</b> toolkit." [...] Thus, a hash function design competition was meant to select a new U.S. national standard, to be called SHA-3, by 2012. The competition ended on October 2, 2012 when the NIST announced that Keccak would be the new SHA-3 <b>hash</b> <b>algorithm.</b> Unlike block and stream ciphers that are invertible, cryptographic hash functions produce a hashed output that cannot be used to retrieve the original input data. Cryptographic hash {{functions are}} used to verify the authenticity of data retrieved from an untrusted source or to add a layer of security.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Cryptographic <b>hash</b> <b>algorithms</b> are {{important}} building blocks in cryptographic protocols, providing authentication and assurance of integrity. While many different <b>hash</b> <b>algorithms</b> are available including MD 5, Tiger, and HAVAL, {{it is difficult}} to compare them since they do not necessarily use the same techniques to achieve their security goals. This work informally describes a framework in four parts which allows different <b>hash</b> <b>algorithms</b> to be compared based on their strengths and weaknesses. By breaking down cryptographic <b>hash</b> <b>algorithms</b> into their preprocessing, postprocessing, compression function, and internal structure components, weaknesses in existing algorithms can be mitigated and new algorithms can take advantage of strong individual components. ...|$|R
