5|$|Lucy Stone {{was born}} on August 13, 1818, on her family's farm at Coy's Hill in West Brookfield, Massachusetts. She was the eighth of nine {{children}} born to Hannah Matthews and Francis Stone; she grew up with three brothers and three sisters, two siblings having died before her own birth. Another member of the Stone household was Sarah Barr, “Aunt Sally” to the children– a sister of Francis Stone who had been abandoned by her husband and left dependent upon her brother. Although farm life was hard work for all and Francis Stone tightly managed the family resources, Lucy remembered her childhood as one of “opulence,” the farm producing all the food the family wanted and enough <b>extra</b> <b>to</b> trade for the few store-bought goods they needed.|$|E

Some 18 varieties of this strain became available, enabling African farmers to produce enough rice to feed their families and have <b>extra</b> <b>to</b> sell.|$|E

25|$|Oftentimes, schools simply {{lack the}} {{resources}} to create an optimal classroom setting for those in need of special education. In the United States, it can cost between $6595 to $10,421 <b>extra</b> <b>to</b> educate a child with autism. In the 2011-2012 school year, {{the average cost of}} education for a public school student was $12,401. In some cases, the extra cost required to educate a child with autism nearly doubles the average cost to educate the average public school student. As the range of those with autism can widely vary, {{it is very difficult to}} create an autism program that is well suited to the entire population of autistics as well as those with other disabilities. In the United States, many school districts are requiring schools to meet the needs of disabled students, regardless of the number of children with disabilities there are in the school. This combined with a shortage of licensed special education teachers has created a deficiency in the special education system. The shortage has caused some states to give temporary special education licenses to teachers with the caveat that they receive a license within a few years.|$|E

He is a marvellous player and choosing him in defence is certainly an option but Mikaël Silvestre and John O'Shea should be fit and I have a back four in my mind." [...] The final was United's first since the 1999 UEFA Champions League Final and Ferguson was determined to win: That is too long for us, and we are delighted.

We've played Liverpool once in Cardiff – in the Charity Shield – and lost so I hope this time it will be a different result." ...|$|E
