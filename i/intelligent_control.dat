5|$|It {{was some}} time {{afterward}} when the thought flashed upon {{my mind that}} the disturbances I had observed {{might be due to}} an <b>intelligent</b> <b>control.</b> Although I could not decipher their meaning, it was impossible for me to think of them as having been entirely accidental. The feeling is constantly growing on me that I had been the first to hear the greeting of one planet to another.|$|E

25|$|The CIA {{organized}} the January 1953 Robertson Panel of scientists to debunk {{the data collected}} by the Air Force's Project Blue Book. This included an engineering analysis of UFO maneuvers by Blue Book (including a motion picture film analysis by Naval scientists) that had concluded UFOs were under <b>intelligent</b> <b>control</b> and likely extraterrestrial.|$|E
25|$|The main {{categories}} of networks are acyclic or feedforward neural networks (where the signal passes {{in only one}} direction) and recurrent neural networks (which allow feedback and short-term memories of previous input events). Among the most popular feedforward networks are perceptrons, multi-layer perceptrons and radial basis networks. Neural networks {{can be applied to}} the problem of <b>intelligent</b> <b>control</b> (for robotics) or learning, using such techniques as Hebbian learning, GMDH or competitive learning.|$|E

As well all vehicles can be followed online and on smartphones in real-time throughout the city with the Futár PIDS system, while the continuous introducing of integrated e-ticket system will help the measurement of passenger numbers on each line and the <b>intelligent</b> <b>control</b> of service frequency.|$|E
500|$|Keating filed his dissent, saying, [...] "At a {{time when}} the spread of {{pornography}} has reached epidemic proportions in our country and when the moral fiber of our nation seems to be rapidly unravelling, the desperate need is for enlightenment and <b>intelligent</b> <b>control</b> of the poisons which threaten us – not the declaration of moral bankruptcy inherent in the repeal of the laws which have been the defense of decent people against the pornographer for profit." [...] Keating wrote, [...] "One can consult all the experts he chooses, can write reports, make studies, etc., but the fact that obscenity corrupts lies within the common sense, the reason, and the logic of every man." ...|$|E

30|$|The {{communication}} {{needs of}} different WAP concepts can vary drastically [10]. Some may require measurements to be streamed from multiple locations {{at a rate}} of once per cycle (e.g. <b>intelligent</b> <b>controlled</b> islanding [11]) while others may only require binary signals to be streamed at lower rates (e.g. supervision of backup protection [10]).|$|R
2500|$|Integration of the CNC model into STEP {{to produce}} ISO 10303-238 {{was done in}} the United States, under the NIST ATP Model Driven <b>Intelligent</b> <b>Control</b> of Manufacturing project, led by STEP Tools, Inc. with an {{industrial}} review board (IRB) consisting of Fortune 500 companies, CAD and CAM software developers, machine tool manufacturers, job shops and industry experts.

2500|$|Among {{the robotic}} {{paradigms}} is the hierarchical paradigm {{in which a}} robot operates in a top-down fashion, heavy on planning, especially motion planning. [...] Computer-aided production engineering has been a research focus at NIST since the 1980s. [...] Its Automated Manufacturing Research Facility was used to develop a five layer production control model. [...] In the early 1990s DARPA sponsored research to develop distributed (i.e. networked) <b>intelligent</b> <b>control</b> systems for applications such as military command and control systems. [...] NIST built on earlier research to develop its Real-Time Control System (RCS) and Real-time Control System Software which is a generic hierarchical control system {{that has been used}} to operate a manufacturing cell, a robot crane, and an automated vehicle.|$|E
2500|$|The first {{sightings}} {{occurred in}} November 1944, when pilots flying over Western Europe by night reported seeing fast-moving round glowing objects following their aircraft. The objects were variously described as fiery, and glowing red, white, or orange. Some pilots described them as resembling Christmas-tree lights {{and reported that}} they seemed to toy with the aircraft, making wild turns before simply vanishing. Pilots and aircrew reported that the objects flew formation with their aircraft and behaved {{as if they were}} under <b>intelligent</b> <b>control,</b> but never displayed hostile behavior. However, they could not be outmaneuvered or shot down. The phenomenon was so widespread that the lights earned a name – in the European Theater of Operations they were often called [...] "Kraut fireballs", {{but for the most part}} called [...] "foo-fighters". The military took the sightings seriously, suspecting that the mysterious sightings might be secret German weapons, but further investigation revealed that German and Japanese pilots had reported similar sightings.|$|E

60|$|With {{a beating}} heart, Sybil leant {{back in the}} coach and clasped her hands. Her brain was too wild to think: the {{incidents}} of her life during the last four-and-twenty hours had been so strange and rapid that she seemed almost to resign any quality of <b>intelligent</b> <b>control</b> over her fortunes, and to deliver herself up to the shifting visions of the startling dream. His voice had sounded in her ear as his hand had touched hers. And on those tones her memory lingered, and that pressure had reached her heart. What tender devotion! What earnest fidelity! What brave and romantic faith!
