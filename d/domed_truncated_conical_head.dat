The <b>truncated</b> <b>conical</b> shells are reinforced by single-walled carbon nanotubes (SWCNTs) that {{vary according to}} the linear functions of the shell thickness. The motion equations are solved by the Galerkin method and the fourth-order Runge–Kutta method. In numerical results, the influences of geometrical parameters, elastic foundations, natural frequency parameters, and nanotube volume fraction of FG-CNTRC <b>truncated</b> <b>conical</b> shells are investigated.

To validate Ogden hyper-elastic material model in simulation, the small impact test was performed. As the comparison for the time history of the acceleration between the impact test and simulation was performed.

40|$|The {{purpose of}} the present study is to improve the method for {{automatic}} measurement of particle-size distribution. 　In this attempt, the author has designed a special <b>conical</b> <b>head,</b> of which the base has a three dimensional Archimede 2 ̆ 7 s spiral contour, as a separator of particles. When particles are placed on the top of the specially designed <b>conical</b> <b>head,</b> they descend along its slope and then begin to drop one after another from it as a result of difference in the lengths of their descending paths. In order to enhance the effect of the separation, the <b>conical</b> <b>heads</b> and the hoppers are arranged, one after the other, in a vertical series. 　The results obtained on this apparatus are as follows :　The length of time required for a given number of particles to descend from the top of the <b>conical</b> <b>head</b> to the exit of the underlaying hopper is proportional to both the square root of ⊿lmax (⊿lmax is a maximum difference in the length of the generating line of the <b>conical</b> <b>head)</b> and the number of the <b>conical</b> <b>heads,</b> but is not affected by the nurnber of feeding particles...|$|R

40|$|In our {{previous}} studies {{a new type}} of grid-domed textile composite with high specific energy-absorbing capacity was developed. Each cell of the grid-domed textile composites consists of a hemispherical shell connected to a <b>truncated</b> <b>conical</b> wall (Configuration 1). In the present paper, a new cell configuration is examined, whose cell is a <b>truncated</b> <b>conical</b> shell only (Configuration 2). The grid-domed textile composite with Configuration 2 displays a higher energy-absorbing capacity, more stable deformation mode, lower peak force and almost constant magnitude of force during its large deformation process. The factors having an influence on the energy-absorbing capacity, which are investigated, include the cell height, the diameter ratio of cell-top to cell-bottom, conical wall area, cell density and the resin added-on percentage. The effective parameters to control the energy-absorbing capacity of the grid-domed textile composites are the semi-apical angle and the cell wall area. Increasing the cell density leads to the enhancement of the energy-absorbing capacity. (C) 2000 Elsevier Science Ltd. All rights reserved...|$|R

The paper reinvestigates the buckling of an axially compressed <b>truncated</b> <b>conical</b> shell with rigid bulkheads. Two improvements are achieved. First, {{the condition that}} the total horizontal displacement must vanish due to rigid bulkhead and axisymmetry is treated as a constraint.

Second, the stability is evaluated in the deformed state using the asymptotic solutions of the pair of Donnell-type equations for axisymmetric configuration. The results indicate that the buckling strength of conical shells depends mainly on the condition of the smaller end.
