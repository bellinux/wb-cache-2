40|$|Freshwater is a {{fundamental}} requirement for human life. Many urban or urbanising areas are reliant upon groundwater for drinking water supply. The provision of sanitation is a key requirement {{for the improvement of}} human health, particularly in the urban environment. The removal of human excreta from the urban environment may directly improve human health, but traditional forms of disposal (flush and discharge; drop and store) represent a waste of nutrient resources. It is recognised that urine particularly contains nutrients that are of potential use in agriculture. <b>Ecological</b> alternatives in <b>sanitation</b> seek to simultaneously remove human waste from the environment whilst reusing the useful constituents through the principal of sanitise and reuse, thus closing the nutrient cycle. However, there is another cycle to consider; the waterborne disease cycle.

40|$|Abstract — Urine is {{residual}} fluid excreted by kidneys through {{urinary tract}} to {{outside of the}} human body, to maintain homeostasis of fluid in the body. Normally urine still contains high amount of nitrogen, which is 87 %, phosphor 50 %, potassium 54 % and low bacterial content. With these contents urine potentially becomes organic fertilizer rich with nitrogen, phosphor and potassium contents and is beneficial to plants. However, until today the utilization or urine in Indonesia is very low. The urine produced is dispose with feces in toilets. This study aimed to utilize urine as solid organic fertilizer using magnesium oxide (MgO), zeolite, and actived carbon as absorbents of ammonium and phosphor. The study started with collecting urine, time variations of urine storage were 24; 48 and 72 hours, and urine was mixed with water as an assumption that urine mixes with water when flushed in urinals. The result showed effectiveness of optimum urine absorption in urine stored for 48 hours by adding 8 gram MgO, producing ammonium and phosphor contents 56. 100 ppm and 3. 610 ppm, respectively. From environmental perspective, utilization of urine as organic fertilizer was applicable because it satisfied the <b>ecological</b> principle of <b>sanitation</b> to prevent soil pollution, ground and surface water pollution and its utilization as agricultural resources...|$|R

Five river water quality classes; class I (high), class II (good), class III (moderate), class IV (poor) and class V (bad) {{have been used to}} describe the effect of organic degradable pollution (saprobic approach). The response of benthic macroinvertebrates varied with organic pollution, sediment extraction and river crossings.

Proved that one way of solving this problem is the establishment of restoictions of land rights, restrictions in land use. However, the mechanism of regulation establishment, implementation and termination of restrictions on the rights to land are not very functional and needs improvement. Current legislation in Ukraine does not contain a balanced set of regulations that would determine the nature and objectives of the restrictions, including encumbrances of land rights, their types, the reasons establishing and implementing restrictions of ownership and other rights to land and so on. Based on our analysis, we provide scientifically grounded suggestions on improving the legal framework, particularly, in terms of restrictions on land use and registration in the land management process, as an important means of influence on those rights in order to ensure rational land use and protection it is. Proved that the efficiency of administrative decisions during setting restrictions on land use purpose and usage of land is possible on the basis of land zoning, thus, it is necessary to adopt the Law of Ukraine "On land zoning. " In addition, the current classification of land use restrictions, which was proposed by prominent scientists in Ukraine AM Tretyak (classification of restrictions in land use by functional features), and D. S. Dobryak and D. I. Babmindra (classification of restrictions on land use based on their placement by owners and land users), is complemented by types, namely: legal, environmental, <b>ecological,</b> technological, <b>sanitation,</b> urban and special. In the result of scientific studies,we have proposed a model of methodological process of land management actions on formation of territorial restrictions in land use, formed on the principles of state security, a combination of state and local interests, to achieve a balanced ratio of economic and environmental interests of society and to ensure rational land use.
