5|$|The Sovetsky Soyuz-class {{ships were}} {{provided}} with aircraft facilities to handle two to four KOR-2 flying boats which would be launched by the two catapults mounted on the stern.

5|$|Following the {{realization}} in February 1915 {{that the war}} would not be won quickly, the Navy department decided to replace the six armored cruisers that had been lost thus far. The ships were improved versions of the Derfflinger class; the primary alterations being {{the adoption of the}} 35cm (13.8in) gun for the main battery, along with a full-length <b>forecastle</b> <b>deck.</b> Four ships were ordered and laid down, but only two of them, Mackensen and Graf Spee, were launched. None of the ships were completed, as work had been diverted to U-boat construction. All four ships were broken up in Germany between 1921 and 1924.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War I, the number of 50-caliber 76mm guns was reduced to 13, all mounted on the turret tops, and six new 40-caliber 76-millimeter {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) guns were installed abreast the aft funnel. In addition two license-built 2-pounder AA guns were mounted on the <b>forecastle</b> <b>deck</b> abreast 'B' turret. In 1925–26 the foremast was replaced by a tetrapodal mast, which was moved forward of the funnels, the rangefinders were upgraded, and the ships were equipped to handle a Macchi M.18 seaplane mounted on the center turret. Around that same time, {{one or both of the}} ships was equipped with a fixed aircraft catapult on the port side of the forecastle.|$|E
2500|$|Hibernia had two decks, with poop and <b>forecastle</b> <b>decks.</b> She had [...] three masts, {{a square}} stern, quarter quarter galleries, and a scroll head. She was {{registered}} at Bristol on 6 April 1829, with owner John Cambridge. Cambridge mortgaged her, but died. The mortgage holders died also, and the executors of his will {{and that of}} the executors of the holders, who were in bankruptcy when they died, sold Hibernia on 8 November 1832 to Edward Walkinshaw, a merchant of Liverpool.|$|R

5|$|The first turuma, Norden, was c. 35m (116ft) {{long and}} 8m (26.5ft) wide with {{a draft of}} 3.3m (11ft). By the third ship, the Lodbrok (1771), the hull had been {{expanded}} to 38.5m (126ft) by 9.5m (31ft) and remained roughly the same. The armament was considerably heavier {{than that of the}} galleys, or the smaller udemas and pojomas. It had one full gundeck of 22 (24 in the ships built before 1790) 12-pounders in a regular broadside arrangement, firing through gunports. On the <b>forecastle</b> <b>deck</b> facing straight forward were two 18-pounders. For close-range action it carried another up to 24 3-pound swivel guns along the railings.

5|$|In 1951, Wrangler {{became the}} first ship of her class to be {{converted}} into a Type 15 anti-submarine frigate. This was a major reconstruction that involved {{the removal of the}} superstructure, masts and armament as well most of the internal equipment. To increase the usable volume of the hull and to improve crew comfort, the <b>forecastle</b> <b>deck</b> was extended almost {{all the way to the}} stern and a new superstructure was built above it, made of aluminium to reduce topweight. Two lattice masts were added to carry the Type 277Q surface-search, Type 274 navigation, and Type 293Q gunnery radars. The ship's main gun armament now consisted of a twin-gun turret fitted with 4-inch (102mm) Mk XVI guns mounted aft and a water-cooled, twin-gun Mk V mount for 40mm Bofors guns above the bridge. The pair of triple-barrelled Squid anti-submarine mortars were shifted to the quarterdeck aft and were controlled by Type 170 and 174 ASDIC systems.|$|E
5|$|After the battle, Duke of Edinburgh was {{attached}} to the 2nd Cruiser Squadron and remained at sea until 2 June, searching for disabled ships. She arrived in Scapa Flow on the afternoon of 3 June. On the evening of 18 August 1916, the Grand Fleet, including Duke of Edinburgh, put to sea in response to a deciphered message that the High Seas Fleet, minus the II Battle Squadron, would be leaving harbour that night. The Germans planned to bombard the port of Sunderland on 19 August, with extensive reconnaissance provided by airships and submarines. The Germans broke off their planned attack to pursue a lone British battle squadron reported by an airship, which was in fact the Harwich Force under Commodore Tyrwhitt. Realising their mistake, the Germans then set course for home. After Jutland the 2nd Cruiser Squadron, now including Duke of Edinburgh, was ordered to reinforce the patrols north of the Shetland Islands against German blockade runners and commerce raiders. The ship's foremast was converted to a tripod to support the weight of a fire-control director in May 1917, but when the director was actually fitted is not known. Two more 6-inch guns were added in embrasures on the <b>forecastle</b> <b>deck</b> during that same refit. She was transferred to the North America and West Indies Station in August 1917 for convoy escort duties, where she remained {{for the duration of the}} war. Upon her return, Duke of Edinburgh was stationed in the Humber, before she was sold for scrap on 12 April 1920 and broken up at Blyth in Northumberland.|$|E
25|$|The vessels were {{designed}} {{with a single}} deck with a long raised quarter deck carried to the fore side of the trawl winch and also a raised top-gallant forecastle. On the <b>forecastle</b> <b>deck</b> a windlass for working the winch was fitted, and an anchor of the stockless type housed in a long hawse pipe. An iron breakwater was also fitted to divert the sea when the vessels are being driven in heavy weather. The crew was housed under the <b>forecastle</b> <b>deck,</b> the entrance being through a lobby on the starboard side over which the <b>forecastle</b> <b>deck</b> was carried affording ample protection to the crew when entering or leaving the forecastle in heavy weather.|$|E

25|$|Astoria lost {{steering}} {{control on the}} bridge at about 0225, shifted control to central station, and began steering a zig-zag course south. Before she made much progress, though, the heavy cruiser lost all power. Fortunately, the Japanese chose that exact instant to withdraw.

50|$|At {{that point}} her boilers broke down, {{and she was}} unable to move. Nevertheless William G.

The latter included iron plates placed around the <b>forecastle,</b> quarter <b>deck,</b> and wheelhouse.

50|$|The three-island {{principle}} was {{a technique}} {{used in the}} construction of steel-hulled ships whereby a ship was built with a <b>forecastle,</b> bridge <b>deck,</b> and poop. The technique allowed the economical and efficient construction of ships and was particularly common in tramp steamers and smaller vessels of the nineteenth and early twentieth centuries. The Knight of Malta, for instance, a 1929 steam ferry of only 16ft draught that operated between Malta and Sicily, was built on the principle.|$|R

50|$|The vessels had two {{complete}} decks, {{upper and}} lower, with poop and <b>forecastle</b> <b>decks.</b> The poop contained cabins for the captain, first lieutenant, and navigating officer, with the double wheel sheltered under its forward end. The forecastle {{was used for}} the heads and working space for the cables. Between these was the open quarterdeck in the waist of the ship, on which the battery was located. Under the lower deck were spaces for water, provisions, coal, and magazines for shell and powder. Amidships were the engine and boiler rooms. These were covered by an armoured deck, 1.5 in thick and approximately 103 ft long. This armour was about 3 ft underneath the lower deck, and the space between could be used for additional coal bunkerage. The machinery spaces were flanked by coal bunkers, affording the machinery and magazines some protection from the sides. The lower deck, above the machinery spaces, was used for berthing of the ship's company; officers aft, warrant and petty officers forward, and ratings amidships, as was traditional. The tops of the coal bunkers, which projected above deck level, could be used for seating {{on one side of the}} mess tables, which were arranged fore-and-aft. The living spaces were well-ventilated and an improvement over prior vessels.|$|R

Another arched deck of the same thickness covered the stern aft of the rear transverse bulkhead.|$|E
