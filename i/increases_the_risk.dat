5|$|Serotonergic drugs (such as most antidepressants) co-administered with {{amphetamine}} <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of serotonin syndrome.|$|E
5|$|Chronic {{lung disease}} is another {{significant}} risk factor. Silicosis <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> about 30-fold. Those who smoke cigarettes have {{nearly twice the}} risk of TB compared to nonsmokers.|$|E
5|$|The {{presence}} of a permanent biliary stent (e.g. in pancreatic cancer) slightly <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of cholangitis, but stents of this type are often {{needed to keep the}} bile duct patent under outside pressure.|$|E
50|$|The {{issue of}} whether {{angiotensin}} II receptor antagonists slightly <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of myocardial infarction (MI or heart attack) is currently being investigated. Some studies suggest ARBs can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of MI. However, other studies have found ARBs do not <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of MI. To date, with no consensus on whether ARBs {{have a tendency to}} <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of myocardial infarction, further investigations are underway.|$|R
50|$|Borage {{seed oil}} might prolong {{bleeding}} time, <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of bruising and bleeding, and <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of bleeding {{during and after}} surgery.|$|R
25|$|A {{number of}} {{medications}} {{are found to}} cause upper GI bleeds. NSAIDs or COX-2 inhibitors <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> about fourfold. SSRIs, corticosteroids, and anticoagulants may also <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk.</b> <b>The</b> <b>risk</b> with dabigatran is 30% greater than that with warfarin.|$|R
5|$|When {{taken with}} NSAIDS (non-steroidal {{anti-inflammatory}} medications), warfarin <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> for gastrointestinal bleeding. This increased risk {{is due to}} the anti-platelet effect of NSAIDS as well as the possible damage to the gastrointestinal mucosa.|$|E
5|$|Common {{side effects}} include nausea, diarrhea, rash, and pain {{at the site}} of injection. It <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of hospital-acquired Clostridium difficile colitis about fourfold. Other {{antibiotics}} may be recommended instead due to this reason. It appears to be generally safe in pregnancy. It is of the lincosamide class and works by blocking bacteria from making protein.|$|E
5|$|The {{anatomical}} {{structure of the}} internal organs and tissues of the female reproductive tract provides a pathway for pathogens to ascend from the vagina to the pelvic cavity thorough the infundibulum. The disturbance of the naturally occurring vaginal microbiota associated with bacterial vaginosis <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of PID.|$|E
50|$|Ranitidine {{and other}} {{histamine}} H2 receptor antagonists may <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of pneumonia in hospitalized patients. They may also <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of community-acquired pneumonia in adults and children.|$|R

5|$|Venous {{thrombosis}} {{may also}} occur in more unusual places: in the veins of the brain, liver (portal vein thrombosis and hepatic vein thrombosis), mesenteric vein, kidney (renal vein thrombosis) and the veins of the arms. Whether thrombophilia also <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of arterial thrombosis (which is {{the underlying cause}} of heart attacks and strokes) is less well established.|$|E
5|$|A primary {{pneumothorax}} is {{one that}} occurs without an apparent cause {{and in the absence}} of significant lung disease, while a secondary pneumothorax occurs in the presence of existing lung disease. Smoking <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> as do lung diseases including COPD, asthma, and tuberculosis. A pneumothorax can also be caused by physical trauma to the chest (including a blast injury), or as a complication of a healthcare intervention; in which case it is called a traumatic pneumothorax.|$|E
5|$|An {{overhead}} or penetration diving {{environment is}} where the diver enters a space from {{which there is no}} direct, purely vertical ascent to the safety of breathable atmosphere at the surface. Cave diving, wreck diving, ice diving and diving inside other natural or artificial underwater structures or enclosures are examples. The restriction on direct ascent <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of diving under an overhead, and this is usually addressed by adaptations of procedures and use of equipment such as redundant breathing gas sources and guide lines to indicate the route to the exit.|$|E
40|$|This study reanalyses data {{using a new}} {{analytical}} approach, {{taking into}} account, that some risk-factors will <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> for a herd to be positive, whereas other risk factors tend to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of a high prevalence in positive herds. The zero-inflated model showed that use of pelleted feed <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of being positive for the herd. In positive herds, use of pelleted feed, dry feed, increasing herd size and conventional (non-SPF) health status <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> prevalence...|$|R

25|$|A {{threshold}} value can be varied {{to make the}} test more restrictive or more sensitive, with the more restrictive tests <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of rejecting true positives, and the more sensitive tests <b>increasing</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of accepting false positives.|$|R
5|$|DPB has {{its highest}} {{prevalence}} among the Japanese, at 11 per 100,000 population. Korean, Chinese, and Thai individuals {{with the disease}} have been reported as well. A genetic predisposition among East Asians is suggested. The disease {{is more common in}} males, with the male to female ratio at 1.42:1 (or about 5 men to 3 women). The average onset of the disease is around age 40, and two-thirds of those affected are non-smokers, although smoking is not believed to be a cause. The presence of HLA-Bw54 <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of diffuse panbronchiolitis 13.3-fold.|$|E
5|$|Dengue {{is spread}} by {{several species of}} {{mosquito}} of the Aedes type, principally A. aegypti. The virus has five different types; infection with one type usually gives lifelong immunity to that type, but only short-term immunity to the others. Subsequent infection with a different type <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of severe complications. A number of tests are available to confirm the diagnosis including detecting antibodies to the virus or its RNA.|$|E
5|$|Epilepsy {{may occur}} {{as a result of}} a number of other {{conditions}} including tumors, strokes, head trauma, previous infections of the central nervous system, genetic abnormalities, and as a result of brain damage around the time of birth. Of those with brain tumors, almost 30% have epilepsy, making them the cause of about 4% of cases. The risk is greatest for tumors in the temporal lobe and those that grow slowly. Other mass lesions such as cerebral cavernous malformations and arteriovenous malformations have risks as high as 4060%. Of those who have had a stroke, 2–4% develop epilepsy. In the United Kingdom strokes account for 15% of cases and it is believed to be the cause in 30% of the elderly. Between 6 and 20% of epilepsy is believed to be due to head trauma. Mild brain injury <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> about two-fold while severe brain injury <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> seven-fold. In those who have experienced a high-powered gunshot wound to the head, the risk is about 50%.|$|E
25|$|As early human {{ancestors}} {{evolved into}} bipeds, changes {{occurred in the}} pelvis, hip joint and spine which <b>increased</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of osteoarthritis. Additionally genetic variations that <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> were likely not selected against because usually problems only occur after reproductive success.|$|R
50|$|Other {{risk factors}} are poorly understood. However, {{conditions}} that reduce immune function, such as malnutrition, other illnesses, or host genetic differences, may <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of developing leprosy. Despite this, infection with HIV {{does not appear}} to <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of developing leprosy.|$|R
50|$|Topical {{administration}} of steroids and non-steroid anti-inflammatory drugs are first-line treatment {{for individuals with}} CNV. The {{administration of}} steroids can <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of infection, glaucoma, cataracts, herpes simplex recurrence. The anti-inflammatory drugs, however, <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of corneal ulceration and melting.|$|R
5|$|Fasting {{is a risk}} factor, {{possibly}} because of depletion of liver glutathione reserves. The concomitant use of the CYP2E1 inhibitor isoniazid <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of hepatotoxicity, though whether 2E1 induction {{is related to the}} hepatotoxicity in this case is unclear. Concomitant use of other drugs that induce CYP enzymes, such as antiepileptics including carbamazepine, phenytoin, and barbiturates, have also been reported as risk factors.|$|E
5|$|Hypothermia {{is reduced}} body {{temperature}} {{that happens when}} a body loses more heat than it generates. Hypothermia is a major limitation to swimming or diving in cold water. The reduction in finger dexterity due to pain or numbness decreases general safety and work capacity, which in turn <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of other injuries. Body heat is lost much more quickly in water than in air, so water temperatures that would be tolerable as outdoor air temperatures can lead to hypothermia, which may lead to death from other causes in inadequately protected divers.|$|E
5|$|Initially, Sanders and KFC used {{hydrogenated}} {{vegetable oil}} for frying, {{but in the}} 1980s the company began to switch to cheaper oils such as palm or soybean. In the 2000s {{it became apparent that}} these oils contain relatively high levels of trans fat, which <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of heart disease. By April 2007, the chain had switched to trans fat-free soybean oil in all of its US outlets.|$|E
50|$|Like other SSRIs, olanzapine/fluoxetine {{carries a}} boxed warning stating {{that it could}} <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of suicidal {{thoughts}} and behaviors in patients aged 24 and under.

5|$|Several {{congenital}} {{conditions may}} <b>increase</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of leukemia; <b>the</b> most common is probably Down syndrome, which {{is associated with}} a 10- to 18-fold <b>increase</b> in <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of AML.|$|R
5|$|Metformin is {{contraindicated}} {{in people}} with any condition that could {{increase the risk of}} lactic acidosis, including kidney disorders (arbitrarily defined as creatinine levels over 150 μmol/l (1.7mg/dl),), lung disease and liver disease. According to the prescribing information, heart failure (in particular, unstable or acute congestive heart failure) <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of lactic acidosis with metformin. A 2007 systematic review of controlled trials, however, suggested metformin is the only antidiabetic drug not associated with any measurable harm {{in people with}} heart failure, and it may reduce mortality in comparison with other antidiabetic agents.|$|E
5|$|Outdoor air pollutants, {{especially}} chemicals {{released from}} the burning of fossil fuels, {{increase the risk of}} lung cancer. Fine particulates (PM2.5) and sulfate aerosols, which may be released in traffic exhaust fumes, are associated with slightly increased risk. For nitrogen dioxide, an incremental increase of 10 parts per billion <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of lung cancer by 14%. Outdoor air pollution is estimated to account for 1–2% of lung cancers.|$|E
5|$|Plutonium-239 and 240 emit {{ionizing}} radiation {{in the form}} of alpha particles. Inhalation is the primary pathway by which plutonium enters the body, though plutonium can also enter the body through a wound. Once inhaled, plutonium <b>increases</b> <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of lung cancer, liver cancer, bone cancer, and leukemia. Once absorbed into the body, the biological half life of plutonium is about 200 years.|$|E
50|$|Dietary factors also {{influence}} <b>the</b> <b>risk</b> of developing type 2 DM.
