A natural question when introduced to these models is first to understand the random lattice itself: how does it look like in the limit?

While the occurrence of gold in granites described in this note appears to be a new discovery, the fact that gold is present in shear zones in the granitic rocks at Yellowknife is not novel. Gold in shear zones in granitic rocks and granite dikes was first noted by Jolliffe (2) and later described in my memoir (1). Furthermore, when I was working in the Yellowknife-Gordon Lake area I noted specks of gold and a few sulfides in narrow shear zones in many types of granitic rocks.

The historian of the future need look no farther than our houses (if any remain), to be satisfied that we had more than the necessities of existence. The Maryland aristocrat with his town place and his country place was indeed a parallel of the patrician at home. He wore his English clothes, drove and rode his English horses, and his coaches were built in Long Acre. His heavy silver service came from Fleet Street, and his claret and Champagne and Lisbon and Madeira were the best that could be bought or smuggled.

However, {{it soon became clear}} that a lucrative market existed alongside this for combining search with advertising, targeted to the queries that users were issuing. The basic idea behind this is simple. Early Web advertising was sold on the basis of “impressions, ” by analogy with the print ads one sees in newspapers or magazines: a company like Yahoo! would negotiate a rate with an advertiser, agreeing on a price for showing its ad a fixed number of times. But suppose I’m a very small retailer who’s trying to sell a specialized product; say, for example, that I run a business that sells calligraphy pens over the Web.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I intend {{to present the}} “narrative part” of a larger study, Genre Space of Traditional Russian Folklore (or Ethnopoetry, Oral Poetry), which is {{described}} in its entirety elsewhere. Two main dimensions (axes, distinctive features) of the space are (a) versified vs. non-versified (verse in Russian folklore, as in some others as well, means sung or recitative performance), and (b) prosaic vs. non prosaic, where prose actually means ‘a story’, i. e., narrative. Thus we have four groups of genres: (1) narrative in verse, (2) non-versified narrative (prose sensu stricto), (3) non-narrative verse (lyrical song, laments) and (4) “neither verse nor prose” (paroemia, spells, etc.). The structure of the two narrative groups is mainly symmetrical; each of them has one nuclear genre, a “main” or most representative genre (fairy tale in non-versified genres, and bylina (epics) in versified ones) and peripheral genres,largely corresponding to each other. The category of ‘spiritual verses’ (dukhovnyie stikhi) corresponds to sacred legends (both being sacral genres), although their repertory of tale types is quite different (e. g., non-versified oral legend includes no hagiographic legends, vitae). Historical songs (some historical ballads as well) share common subject matter with historical legends (istoricheskoe predanie – tales about historical persons). Ballads roughly correspond to novelles (usually called novelistic or Romantic tales, AaTh 850 – 899), while comic or parody epics resemble the “Jokes and Anecdotes” of Aarne’s classification. For many European traditions <b>I</b> <b>might</b> <b>mention</b> Animal Tales and Animal Epics, respectively, but Russian tradition has no animal epics in verse. Each group has one feature that diminishes as one moves from the nuclear genre to the peripheral ones; in verse genres, this is verse itself. Epics are sung in bylina (epic) verse; other genres combine epic verse and song-verse. In non-versified texts this feature is a stylistic elaboration, with special formulas {{which can be found}} to a most sophisticated degree in fairytales and are much less prominent in other genres. Some other types of symmetry connect these genres with non-narrative ones...|$|R
