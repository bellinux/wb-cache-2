500|$|Show runners Damon Lindelof and Carlton Cuse wrote [...] "I Do" [...] as a [...] "mini-season finale", {{as it was}} {{the last}} episode before mid-season hiatus, and would end in a cliffhanger. It also served as a climax and {{beginning}} of a closure of Jack, Kate and Sawyer's captivity on Hydra Island, with the writers saying that afterwards there would be a return to the beach and the six-episode block would be [...] "more palatable" [...] and make more sense, comparing them to the first seven episodes of season 2 where the tail section survivors are introduced. Executive producer Bryan Burk also said the pre-hiatus episodes were [...] "our season 2.5.

500|$|An {{accompanying}} {{music video}} {{was directed by}} Douglas Avery, and was filmed in Monte Carlo in July 2000. The plot was loosely based on Martin Scorsese's 1995 crime drama movie Casino, with Minogue herself portraying a character using aspects of Sharon Stone's bored trophy wife. Dutch actor Rutger Hauer served as Minogue's on-screen mob partner and husband. According to Hauer, {{no one from the}} set—including the singer, and apart from Avery—knew he was appearing as a cameo. Regarding the on-screen relationship, the singer stated; [...] "In my opinion, the Rutger Hauer character <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a minder or he's in charge of her, although there is that kind of strong sexual tension." [...] The artist wore three outfits in the video—a multi-coloured dress {{at the start of the}} visual, a black dress during her appearance at a casino in Monte Carlo, and a final blue cocktail dress. She had sported an estimated $2 million worth of jewellery and diamonds during filming, with a few security guards having to accompany her on the set.|$|E
500|$|American {{musician}} Shawn Colvin guest {{starred in}} the episode as Rachel Jordan, a character that she would later return to voice in the episode [...] "I'm Goin' to Praiseland" [...] (2001) from season twelve. In that episode, she stays at the Flanders' house with Ned, and leaves briefly after he attempted to mold her {{in the image of}} his deceased wife. At the end of the episode, however, she returns and has a date with him. Colvin told the Seattle Post-Intelligencer that being raised in Carbondale, Illinois meant she did not have to do much research for the guest appearance: [...] "It's just very isolated [...] There was church music and that was about it. [...] I didn't have to dig too deep for the role. I suppose the whole 'Simpsons' thing <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a hick town." [...] Colvin has shown a segment of her guest role on The Simpsons during some of her concerts, including one at Cape Cod Melody Tent in 2007. She has also performed the song that she sings in [...] "Alone Again, Natura-Diddily" [...] in concert. The Wisconsin State Journal reported that during her 2001 concert at Barrymore Theatre, the [...] "loudest audience response came after she sang a ditty that she performed as a character on The Simpsons." [...] The song, called [...] "He's the Man", later appeared on the 2007 soundtrack album [...]|$|E
5000|$|Stanley {{described}} {{the story of}} the song: [...] "It was written about an encounter with somebody in a bar, and then {{at the end of the}} song I didn't know quite how to end it so I came up with this riff that <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a Black Sabbath <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> riff and we tacked that on." ...|$|R

500|$|Brothers Glenn and Todd Kessler {{decided to}} work with Daniel Zelman because [...] "we have a third brother, but Daniel <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> our fourth brother that we've known for over 20 years." [...] When the Kesslers and Zelman devised the series, they did not {{specifically}} intend for Patty and Ellen to be lawyers. They wanted to explore the power structures in two strong women—feeling that the male power dynamics had been seen before—and considered a number of professions, including entertainment and pharmaceuticals, before deciding on law. Zelman said that the writers' main motivation {{to write about the}} law [...] "was our interest in power dynamics, the dynamics of power in society. We're very much interested in the ambiguity of it. We're just interested in seeing how far we can push these characters." [...] According to Kessler, [...] "One thing that's crucial is that Patty Hewes is {{on one end of the}} spectrum and Ellen Parsons is on the other." [...] The relationship the writers were most interested in showing was that between a mentor and a mentee, which is represented by Patty and her protégée Ellen. Todd Kessler called the real life Enron case [...] "a big part" [...] of the inspiration for Patty's main case involving Arthur Frobisher, though Zelman claims that Enron was not used as a basis in particular: [...] "It was more just the culture of all those corporate scandals at the time. There seemed to be one after the other of them, and we became very interested in sort of the characters who were a part of those scandals." ...|$|E
500|$|Wolfgang Flür {{has stated}} Kraftwerk were {{influenced}} by {{the music of the}} Weimar Germany era: [...] "we were children who were born straight after World War Two ... we had no musical or pop culture of our own ... there was the war, and before the war we had only the German folk music. In the 1920s or 1930s melodies were developed and these became culture that we worked from". Karl Bartos also spoke of post-war influence as the group thought that they [...] "had this development in the 1920s which was very, very strong and was audio visual. We had the Bauhaus school before the war and then after the war we had tremendous people like Karlheinz Stockhausen and the development of the classical and the electronic classical. This was very strong and it all happened very close to Düsseldorf in Cologne and all the great composers at that time came there." [...] Paul Alessandrini is credited for helping contribute to the album's concept. Alessandrini told Hütter and Schneider that [...] "with the kind of music you do, which <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> an electronic blues, railway stations and trains are very important in your universe, you should do a song about the Trans Europe Express". Kraftwerk believed critics in the United Kingdom and the United States associated them with Nazi Germany, with tracks such as [...] "Autobahn" [...] inextricably linked with the Nazis who built the high-speed roads in the 1930s and 1940s. At the same time, the band were keen to move away from their German heritage towards a new sense of European identity and felt that the Trans Europ Express could be used to symbolize this. Allmusic referred to Trans-Europe Express as a concept album with two different themes. The first being the disparities between reality and image, represented by the songs [...] "Hall of Mirrors" [...] and [...] "Showroom Dummies", and the others about the glorification of Europe. Slant Magazine described the album as [...] "a sonic poem to Europe".|$|E
2500|$|The {{majority}} of the band's music and lyrics were written by Patton, Dunn, and Spruance, with McKinnon and Heifetz occasionally contributing. Regarding their creative process, Bär McKinnon stated in a 2000 interview that [...] "This band <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a cruel boys club in a way. You bring some ideas and if you're not 100 percent firm about bringing a certain idea to this group, you can watch it get kicked aside and die really quickly." ...|$|E
5000|$|Milo {{has stuck}} with me for almost nine years now, so I wouldn't exactly feel right about just {{continuing}} to call us the Descendents. In a sense that would <b>be</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> discrediting Milo's nine years worth <b>of</b> effort. It's <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like,</b> [...] "Let the Descendents be my and Milo's sacred thing," [...] or whatever. Who knows, at some point later on we might decide {{that we want to}} get together and record something.|$|R

5000|$|Dark was {{released}} 27 May 2013, with Ware explaining the album {{would consist of}} [...] "very dark versions of tunes {{that have to be}} of a certain type. Basically it's dark reinterpretations, primarily looking at things differently from a lyrical point of view. It's almost like soundscape stuff, {{in much the same way}} as [...] "You've Lost That Loving Feeling" [...] on [...] "Reproduction" [...] <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a soundscape." ...|$|R
2500|$|Goyer later explained, [...] "What {{the series}} is, {{in a weird}} way, <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> a Wiseguy with vampires, because Jill's {{character}} {{is kind of a}} double agent working for Blade, within the vampire community, and [...] treating the vampires sort of like the ultimate crime family.

2500|$|In 1978, Orwig {{received}} the James J. Corbett Memorial Award, presented annually to the collegiate administrator who “through {{the years has}} most typified Corbett’s devotion to intercollegiate athletics and worked unceasingly for its betterment." [...] On receiving the award, Orwig said: [...] "This award <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> being named coach of the year.

2500|$|The missionary {{position}} is sometimes mocked as a plain vanilla sex position. Archer stated, [...] "To all the sex gymnasts, {{this kind of}} banal preference looks lazy, unimaginative and uninformed," [...] but she rebuts this by pointing out the existence of variations: [...] "Missionary <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> tofu: You have to add your own flavor." [...] Perhaps due to the ubiquity of this position, its typical role as the first position used by couples, its tendency to put the man in control of speed, tempo and depth, its ability to cause him to quickly reach orgasm, {{and the fact that}} it is literally a [...] "male-superior" [...] position with the man on top, missionary is sometimes associated with men who are dominating and uncreative and selfish about sex. According to Gina Ogden, [...] "the cultural missionary position—man on top" [...] is not conducive to romance since [...] "If a relationship is based on authoritarian control, keeping one person on top and the other underneath, it gets old pretty fast—for both partners, really". In Women Who Love Sex, Ogden writes, [...] "Think what will happen to the missionary position when women, en masse, opt for pleasures that stir body and soul instead of continuing to do good-girl intercourse by the book." [...] In Chinua Achebe's Things Fall Apart, the main character ridicules the idea of women making decisions by saying that one might as well say that the woman lies on top of the man when they are making the baby.|$|E
5000|$|In 1998, he {{starred in}} American History X {{alongside}} Edward Norton and {{appeared in his}} first comedy role in Pecker, directed by John Waters. Of his title role in Pecker, Furlong stated, [...] "It's true most of the characters that I've played so far <b>are</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> suicidal. Really dark roles, which I like. But I {{wanted to do something}} different and John {{gave me a chance to}} do that." ...|$|R
5000|$|During post-production, {{director}} Stevan Mena's initial cut of {{the film}} was three hours long. Things cut from the film included overtly gory scenes. The film is a prequel to Malevolence, stating [...] "The only {{way to describe it}} is like an epic horror story. It's more in the vein of The Shining, whereas the original <b>was</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> Halloween or Friday the 13th. Bereavement is more of a character study".|$|R

2500|$|MSNBC editor Scott Taves praised Travis Touchdown's {{design as}} richly {{detailed}} and flamboyantly designed. Jason Hill of the Sydney Morning Herald described Touchdown as an [...] "absurd, shallow, and pitiful creature", commenting {{that he is}} an analogue to gamers. Sean Ewing of The Star-Ledger called Touchdown the poster-child for what anti-video game extremists like Jack Thompson think gamers are like. Nintendo Power listed Travis as their 15th favourite hero, stating that he <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> them, except that they aren't [...] "lewd, beam katana-wielding assassins". Game Zone editor Stephen Woodward compared Travis to everyday people living in an uber male fantasy, citing him being an otaku and being a luchador fan. PALGN editor David Low described Touchdown as what gamers want to be, though commenting that Suda 51 [...] "accidentally" [...] incorporated the nerdy aspects of his personality into his character. Tampa Bay Online editor Doug Bell found the character rude and detached, but not funny or cool, calling the other assassins better characters. Game Informer editor Matt Miller suggested that there is a connection between sex and extreme violence with Travis, citing a scene where he waits to confess his love to a woman only after she has blown her head off with a grenade. GamesRadar listed him as the seventh greatest assassin, commenting that in spite of his social awkwardness, he is actually a pretty competent assassin. In discussing the [...] "brooding pretty boy" [...] cliché, they used him {{as an example of the}} opposite of this cliché, stating that while he has some qualities of this character type, his personality sets him apart.|$|E
2500|$|Ringer was not {{selected}} in the first 4 rounds of the draft, where he was projected to go by some. Instead, Ringer was selected by the Tennessee Titans in the 5th round of the 2009 NFL Draft, 173rd overall, the 11th RB taken overall. At the time of being drafted, {{he was one of}} eight Running Backs on the Titans roster. Terry McCormick of the Nashville City Paper, when grading the Titans draft, gave the Ringer pick an [...] "A". Ringer said on his Twitter page about being drafted “Titans! I can’t tell you how excited I am!”. He was the first (and only) MSU player drafted this year. Ringer said of his future pro career, [...] "I definitely have something to prove with me showing that I am just as good, if not better, than a lot of the running backs that went above me. I don't want {{to be one of those}} running backs who is titled as, He was a good running back in college and went to the NFL and became a bust. I want to make sure I continue to be called a great running back also in the NFL." [...] He mentioned of where he would fit in, [...] "I would say I fit in pretty well. I know Chris Johnson <b>is</b> <b>kind</b> <b>of</b> <b>like</b> the super-fast one, and LenDale White is like the really big one. I would kind of be in the middle." [...] Ringer is expected to [...] play special teams and operate as a third-down back. Ringer said of the running back situation in Tennessee, [...] "I feel very confident in my abilities. I feel like I'm definitely going to learn a lot from the vets. I'm very happy to be in a room with LenDale White and Chris Johnson. I'm going to make sure to play my role and push them in practice. I'm also going to make sure I ... continue to do what I can do to help Tennessee." [...] Because 23 was taken by Donnie Nickey, Ringer was assigned #3, a number normally prohibited for use by running backs. He kept the number until early August, when he switched to number 21.|$|E
