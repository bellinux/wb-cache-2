5|$|The {{most widely}} {{accepted}} theory {{about the origin of}} cricket is that it first developed in early medieval times to the south and south-east of London in the geographical areas of the North Downs, the South <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> the Weald. The counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey were therefore the earliest centres of excellence and it was from here that the game reached London, where its lasting popularity was ensured, and other southern counties like Berkshire, Essex, Hampshire and Middlesex. As early as c.1611, a cricket match was recorded at Chevening in Kent between teams representing the <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> the Weald.|$|E
5|$|As {{the quarter}} {{came to an}} end, the Hokies gained two quick first <b>downs</b> <b>and</b> {{advanced}} the ball 26yards, seemingly having regained the momentum lost with the blocked kick. With onequarter remaining in the game, however, Kansas still had a three-point lead, 1714.|$|E

5|$|Benbow's {{experience}} led to {{him being}} promoted {{to a similar}} flotilla, this time to be deployed against Dunkirk {{under the command of}} Vice-Admiral Shovell. A number of converted merchant vessels, rigged like fireships but designed to explode rather than burn, were assigned to support the expedition. Benbow had a hand in preparing these vessels for the operation throughout 1694, and worked closely with the principal storekeeper of the ordnance, Willem Meesters. Benbow's attacking fleet was covered by Shovell's fleet on the <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> the attack was planned for 12 and 13 September. However, the French were able to block the entrance to the port, preventing Benbow's squadron from entering, and a storm further disrupted operations. Benbow drew back from Dunkirk, and instead sailed around to Calais, where he carried out a further bombardment on 27 September. He returned to the <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> then resumed his duties at Deptford Dockyard. He spent December organising a convoy for a fleet of merchant vessels due to sail to Cadiz.|$|E
5|$|During the 1989 season, 11–year veteran Ottis Anderson, a Plan B Free Agent, {{emerged as}} the Giants new {{featured}} running back. His style of power running was an ideal fit for Parcells' offensive strategy and he ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third <b>downs</b> <b>and</b> special teams, catching 34 passes for 531yards and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E
5|$|Following the touchdown, Virginia Tech {{kicked the}} ball off to Florida State, {{and after a}} short return, the Seminoles' offense took the field at their 22-yard line.

During the drive, Florida State converted two third <b>downs</b> <b>and</b> Manuel completed passes of 12 yards, 14 yards and 25 yards.|$|E

5|$|From the Nore, Bellerophon {{proceeded}} to the <b>Downs</b> <b>and</b> joined the fleet stationed there. She spent {{three weeks in}} the roadstead, exercising her guns, before moving to Spithead. The diplomatic crisis with Spain had largely abated by October 1790, and Bellerophon was sent to Sheerness in late November. She remained in commission, still under Pasley, during the Russian Armament in 1791, but when this period of tension also passed without breaking into open war, Bellerophon {{was sent back to}} Chatham and paid off there on 9 September 1791.|$|E
5|$|In {{subsequent}} possessions, Nevada and Maryland both {{failed to}} gain first <b>downs</b> <b>and</b> exchanged punts. Nevada quarterback Colin Kaepernick then led a drive {{that included a}} 68-yard pass to the Maryland three-yard line. The Terrapins' defense stopped two rushing attempts by Vai Taua, but a short pass to wide receiver Chris Wellington was completed for Nevada's first touchdown. With the extra point, Nevada took the lead, 7–6. Wolf Pack placekicker Brett Jaekle executed a 69-yard kickoff to Torrey Smith, and he returned it 99yards for a second Maryland touchdown. Egekeze made the extra point and Maryland regained the lead, 13–7, with 7:53 remaining in the quarter.|$|E
5|$|The Giants' 12–4 {{record in}} 1989 was the NFC's second-best (only to San Francisco's 14–2 record) They lost their divisional playoff game in {{overtime}} to the Rams, 19–13. The {{highlight of the}} game was wide receiver Flipper Anderson's catch of the game-winning touchdown pass. After catching the ball, Anderson made a long run to the end zone, silencing the crowd in attendance. In 1989, free-agent acquisition Ottis Anderson ran for 1,023yards and caught 28 passes. Rookie Dave Meggett also emerged as a threat on third <b>downs</b> <b>and</b> special teams, catching 34 passes for 531 yards, and making the Pro Bowl.|$|E

The Bulldogs' offense had 15 first <b>downs,</b> <b>and</b> the only score of the game came when the Bulldogs' Ike Martin had a 7-yard {{touchdown}} run in the first quarter. Jim Thorpe of the Bulldogs, who would later be enshrined in the Pro Football Hall of Fame, made his season debut in the game, coming in as a substitute in the fourth quarter.|$|E

Another gorge, cut by the Hazel Brook (which flows into the River Trym), crosses the Blaise Castle estate in northern Bristol.|$|E
5|$|After {{the failed}} trick play, the Hokies' offense started at their 44-yard line. The first Tech {{play of the}} drive was a 15-yard pass from DeShazo to Still for a first down. A three-yard run by Thomas was {{followed}} by a seven-yard reverse by Still for another first down at the Tennessee 29-yard line. On first down, Thomas pushed the Hokies eight yards forward with a run up the middle. This was followed by two incomplete passes, bringing up fourth down. Again, Tech head coach Frank Beamer elected to try to convert the fourth down rather than kick a field goal. Unlike Tech's previous fourth down, however, the try was unsuccessful after DeShazo mishandled the snap and was tackled for a loss. Virginia Tech turned the ball over on <b>downs,</b> <b>and</b> Tennessee's offense returned to the game with 1:31 remaining in the quarter.|$|E

5|$|Because Air Force {{received}} {{the ball to}} begin the game, Virginia Tech {{received the}} ball to begin the second half. Tech returned the kickoff to its 25-yard line, where the Hokie offense began the first drive {{of the second half}}. The Tech offense used rushes by Lee Suggs and passes by Bryan Randall to pick up several first <b>downs</b> <b>and</b> drive into Air Force territory. But once on the Falcons' side of the field, Tech proved unable to gain another first down and was even pushed back into its own territory by a penalty. Tech was forced to punt, and Air Force began its first offensive possession of the second half at its 20-yard line after a touchback.|$|E
5|$|Following the score, kickoff, and return, Tech began another {{offensive}} possession at its 24-yard line. The Hokies {{picked up}} two first <b>downs</b> <b>and</b> drove into NC State territory, but the clock continued to tick toward halftime. In the Wolfpack {{side of the}} field, Tech running back Eddie Hunter broke free for a 23-yard run, the longest play by Virginia Tech in the second quarter. There was now just over twominutes remaining in the quarter. Tech was unable to pick up another first down after Hunter's run, and attempted to convert the fourth down rather than trying a field goal. When the play was stopped for a loss, however, Virginia Tech was denied points and NC State's offense returned with 47seconds remaining in the half.|$|E
5|$|On the Hokies' second {{offensive}} possession, quarterback Tyrod Taylor {{took the}} field in place of Sean Glennon. Two successful passes and two short runs resulted in two first <b>downs</b> <b>and</b> Virginia Tech advanced the ball across the 50-yard line and into Boston College territory. As Taylor attempted to scramble for yet another short run, however, he was tackled behind {{the line of scrimmage}} and fumbled the ball. The loose ball was scooped up by Boston College defender Jamie Silva, who returned it 51yards for a touchdown. The touchdown and subsequent extra point were the first points of the game and gave Boston College a 70 lead with 4minutes remaining in the quarter.|$|E
