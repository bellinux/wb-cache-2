40|$|In this study, we {{presents}} the potentiality of retrieving Aerosol Optical Thickness (AOT) {{in the atmosphere}} which combined Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite and ground based closures enable the determination of required aerosol characteristics over moderate bright surfaces area of Makkah, Mina and Arafah. A multispectral algorithm was developed by assuming that surface condition of study area was lambertian and homogeneous. In-situ AOT data was calculated using Beer Lambert law from transmittance of atmospheric measured using the FieldSpec handheld spectroradiometer and their locations were determined by a handheld Global Positioning System (GPS). The Digital Number (<b>DN)</b> <b>recorded</b> by satellite imageries were converted to top of the atmosphere (TOA) reflectance which {{is the sum of}} the ground reflectance and atmospheric reflectance. Then, the atmospheric correction (ATCOR 2) method was used to retrieve the surface reflectance. The reflectance measured from the satellite {{at the top of the}} atmosphere (TOA) was subtracted from the amount given by the surface reflectance to obtain the atmospheric reflectance. Measured PM 10 and AOT were correlated with atmospheric reflectance value using regression technique. Various types of regression algorithms were then examined by comparing the correlation coefficient (R) values and the Root-Mean-Square Error (RMSE) values. The three band model of algorithm was selected based on the highest R value and the lowest RMSE value. The proposed algorithm added evidence on the correlation found between aerosol optical thickness derived from Landsat 7 ETM+ satellite using multispectral algorithm with Terra Multiangle Imaging SpectroRadiometer (MISR) AOT product...|$|R

In open ocean waters the optical properties are dominated by phytoplankton density, while the relationship between color and the constituents is more complicated in inland waters varying regionally and seasonally. Concerning the difficulties relating to comprehensive modeling of complex inland and coastal waters, the alternative approach is considered in this paper: the raw digital numbers (<b>DN)</b> <b>recorded</b> using aerial remote hyperspectral sensing are used without corrections and derived by means of regression modeling to predict Chlorophyll a (Chl-a) concentrations using in situ reference measurements. The target {{of this study is}} to estimate which number of local reference measurements is adequate for producing reliable statistical model to predict Chl-a concentration in complex lake water ecosystem. Based on the data collected from boreal lake Lohjanjarvi, the effect of standard ¨ deviation of Chl-a concentration of reference samples and their local clustering on predictability of model increases when number of reference samples or bands used as model variables decreases. However, the 2 or 3 band models are beneficial and more cost efficient when compared to 5 or 7 band models when the standard deviation of Chl-a concentration of reference samples is over certain level. The simple empirical approach combining remote sensing and traditional sampling may be feasible for regional and seasonal retrieval of Chl-a concentration distributions in complex ecosystems, where the comprehensive models are difficult or even impossible to derive...|$|R

Aim: The aim was to assess the association of DN with dental caries and oral hygiene among adolescents in Virajpet, India. Materials and Methods: A total of six hundred adolescents aged 15 - 18 years were selected. <b>DN</b> was <b>recorded</b> using self-administered questionnaire. Oral health status was clinically assessed using simplified oral hygiene index (OHI-S) and dental caries through dentition status as per WHO criteria. Results: The mean DN score for this population was 10. 18. Sociodemographic variables and Dental Attendance pattern were significantly associated with DN. Mean decayed missing filled value and OHI-S values were also significantly associated with DN.

40|$|The caudal dentate nucleus (DN) in lateral {{cerebellum}} {{is connected}} with two visual/oculomotor areas of the cerebrum: the frontal eye field and lateral intraparietal cortex. Many neurons in frontal eye field and lateral intraparietal cortex produce "delay activity" between stimulus and response that correlates with processes such as motor planning. Our hypothesis was that caudal DN neurons would have prominent delay activity as well. From lesion studies, we predicted that this activity would be related to self-timing, i. e., the triggering of saccades based on the internal monitoring of time. We recorded from neurons in the caudal DN of monkeys (Macaca mulatta) that made delayed saccades {{with or without a}} self-timing requirement. Most (84 %) of the caudal DN neurons had delay activity. These neurons conveyed at least three types of information. First, their activity was often correlated, trial by trial, with saccade initiation. Correlations were found more frequently in a task that required self-timing of saccades (53 % of neurons) than in a task that did not (27 % of neurons). Second, the delay activity was often tuned for saccade direction (in 65 % of neurons). This tuning emerged continuously during a trial. Third, the time course of delay activity associated with self-timed saccades differed significantly from that associated with visually guided saccades (in 71 % of neurons). A minority of neurons had sensory-related activity. None had presaccadic bursts, in contrast to <b>DN</b> neurons <b>recorded</b> more rostrally. We conclude that caudal DN neurons convey saccade-related delay activity that may contribute to the motor preparation of when and where to move...|$|R
40|$|Starting in 1994, all AVIRIS data {{distributions}} {{include a}} new product useful for quantification and modeling of the noise in the reported radiance data. The 'postcal' file contains approximately 100 lines of dark current data collected {{at the end of}} each data acquisition run. In essence this is a regular spectral-image cube, with 614 samples, 100 lines and 224 channels, collected with a closed shutter. Since there is no incident radiance signal, the <b>recorded</b> <b>DN</b> measure only the DC signal level and the noise in the system. Similar dark current measurements, made {{at the end of each}} line are used, with a 100 line moving average, to remove the DC signal offset. Therefore, the pixel-by-pixel fluctuations about the mean of this dark current image provide an excellent model for the additive noise that is present in AVIRIS reported radiance data. The 61, 400 dark current spectra can be used to calculate the noise levels in each channel and the noise covariance matrix. Both of these noise parameters should be used to improve spectral processing techniques. Some processing techniques, such as spectral curve fitting, will benefit from a robust estimate of the channel-dependent noise levels. Other techniques, such as automated unmixing and classification, will be improved by the stable and scene-independence noise covariance estimate. Future imaging spectrometry systems should have a similar ability to record dark current data, permitting this noise characterization and modeling...|$|R

Aim: The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the prevalence of CPNP in a rural primary care area in Northern Italy. Materials and Methods: A multicenter audit study was carried out in a rural area in Northern Italy with 113 participating general practitioners (GPs) seeing 58, 480 patients> 18 years during 3 months. Patients who for any reason attended GPs' surgeries and had symptoms suggestive of neuropathic pain (NP) were given the NP diagnostic questionnaire “Douleur Neuropathique en 4 Questions” (<b>DN</b> 4) and <b>recorded</b> their pain level on a visual analog scale (VAS). Results: Chronic NP was established by a DN 4 score of ≥ 4 and a VAS pain score of ≥ 40 mm for> 6 months together with a clinical diagnosis in 448 (254 women and 194 men) out of 58, 480 patients giving a prevalence of 0. 77 %. 179 patients (0. 31 %) had diabetes neuropathy, 142 (0. 24 %) had postherpetic pain, 41 (0. 07 %) had trigeminal neuralgia, 27 (0. 05 %) had NP postinjury, 27 (0. 05 %) had NP caused by nerve entrapments, 11 (0. 02 %) had NP triggered by systemic diseases, and 21 (0. 04 %) had NP of unknown etiology.

40|$|District {{nurses are}} {{the largest group of}} {{community}} nurses in the United Kingdom and an important aspect of their role is the responsibility to assess the health needs of patients at home. To date there has been limited exploration of the knowledge or decision-making underpinning needs assessment in district nursing practice. The aim {{of this study was to}} explore knowledge in use by district nurses at the first assessment visit and the relationship of this knowledge to the decisions they make. The inherent difficulties in exploring the knowledge and decision making of experienced district nurses demanded a systematic and interpretative research approach where the impact of the context could be examined. An ethnographic approach was adopted for the study as the focus on perspectives and activities in the natural setting and the substantial reliance on observation of real examples provided a starting point for this study. Eleven district nurses were accompanied on a first assessment visit. Each district nurse was interviewed twice, immediately following the observed visit and then approximately one year later when preliminary data analysis had been undertaken. This approach to the study revealed a breadth and depth of community nursing knowledge that seemed to incorporate an amalgam of theoretical (knowing that) knowledge with practice based (knowing how) knowledge. The study findings depict the range and scope of the knowledge in use by district nurses and challenge the utility of theoretical models which remove knowledge from the context in which it is used and applied. The most striking findings relate to the influence of the context in which the DN/patient interaction takes place and the reflexive character of the assessment process. In particular, the study illuminates the ways in which DNs utilise a range of cues throughout the assessment process. The information search in assessment is often 'paced' to cope with the uncertainty that exists in many of the complex, multifaceted situations encountered by the DN. Understanding assessment as a paced process was linked to making the best judgement at the time of the first visit. A model of district nurse assessment, which seeks to illuminate the process of assessment, is presented. In particular, this model seeks to highlight the reflexive nature of the assessment process. A typology of district nursing knowledge, which conceptualises six dimensions of practice based knowing in district nursing practice, is also presented. Strategies for decision making are revealed through the application of Carroll and Johnson's (1990) theoretical framework. Recommendations are given for future research and the educational and professional context in which DN practice exists. It is suggested that further research should take cognisance of the ongoing nature of assessment in the community setting. A study conducted over a longer period of time, exploring further the impact of the context on the assessment process, seems particularly important. Given the paced approach to needs assessment and the ongoing nature of assessment identified by the study participants, it is suggested that the qualified DN should be contributing to needs assessment on a continuing basis. This recommendation is counter to recent trends in the skill/grade mix in the DN team which emphasise the need to reduce rather than increase the numbers of qualified DNs. Additionally, given the emphasis on family care by the DNs in this study, it is recommended that <b>DNs</b> should <b>record</b> and examine this important area of their work, so that this aspect of the DN role is identified and acknowledged. Finally, the importance of experiential learning depicted by the participants in this study suggests that work-based and problem-based learning approaches may be the most appropriate way in which to teach DN students about assessment. The findings are therefore important for the education of current and future DNs. This study contributes to the knowledge of assessment practice by increasing understanding of the ways DNs work in relation to the first assessment visit. The model of assessment illuminates the process of assessment and the typology aims to provide a conceptualisation of knowledge in use. Furthermore, the ways in which DNs make decisions is revealed. Therefore, the study findings can inform the education of present and future DNs to the potential benefit of patients and their carers...|$|R
