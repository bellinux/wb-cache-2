40|$|In cloud computing, user {{functional}} requirements are satisfied through service composition. However, {{due to the}} process of interaction and sharing among SaaS services, user privacy data tends to be illegally disclosed to the service participants. In this paper, we propose a privacy data decomposition and discretization method for SaaS services. First, according to logic between the data, we classify the privacy data into discrete privacy data and continuous privacy data. Next, {{in order to protect the}} user privacy information, continuous <b>data</b> <b>chains</b> are decomposed into discrete <b>data</b> <b>chain,</b> and discrete <b>data</b> <b>chains</b> are prevented from being synthesized into continuous <b>data</b> <b>chains.</b> Finally, we propose a protection framework for privacy data and demonstrate its correctness and feasibility with experiments...|$|R
40|$|Abstract—Often, component-based {{real-time}} {{systems are}} modeled with trigger and <b>data</b> <b>chains.</b> The end-to-end timing requirements on trigger chains {{are different from}} those on <b>data</b> <b>chains.</b> For a trigger chain, the interest lies in the calculation of holistic response time and its comparison with end-to-end deadline. Whereas, the schedulability of a <b>data</b> <b>chain</b> requires a comparison between its end-to-end latencies and corresponding deadlines. We discuss the problem of translating end-to-end timing requirements unambiguously from component-based real-time systems into timing analysis models which are required as input by the analysis tools. We also provide preliminary guidelines for such translations in the existing industrial tool suite.

50|$|Files in OS 2200 {{are simply}} {{containers}} {{that may be}} addressed either by word offset in the file or by sector (28-word unit) offset in the file. The 28 words is a historical unit from an early mass storage device (the FASTRAND drum) that could hold 64 such units per physical track. Nonetheless, it is a fortunate historical accident. Four such 28-word units or 112 words occupy 504 bytes. With today’s mass storage devices all using 512-byte physical records, OS 2200 clients have almost all adopted some multiple of 112 words as their physical record size and database page size. I/O processors automatically adjust for the 504<->512 byte mapping adding 8 bytes of zeros on writes and stripping them off on reads of each physical record. OS 2200 handles applications that use sizes other than multiples of 112 words by indivisibly reading the containing physical records and writing back out the unchanged and changed portions with <b>data</b> <b>chaining.</b> Special locking functions guarantee indivisibility even when there are device errors and across multiple systems in a cluster.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{analyzes}} {{the effect of}} resource sharing and assignment on the clock period of the synthesized circuit. The assignment phase assigns or binds operations of the scheduled behavioral description {{to a set of}} allocated resources. We focus on control-flow intensive descriptions, characterized by the presence of mutually exclusive paths due to the presence of nested conditional branches and loops. We show that clustering of multiple operations in the same state of the schedule, possibly leading to chaining of functional units (FUs) in the RTL circuit, is an effective way to minimize the total number of clock cycles and hence the total execution time. We present an assignment algorithm which is particularly effective for such design styles, by minimizing the <b>data</b> <b>chaining</b> and hence the clock period of the circuit, thereby leading to further reduction in the total execution time.

40|$|The {{increasing}} use of data within {{safety related}} systems is often not addressed within current safety cases. Data safety has been highlighted as an issue for over a decade, yet coverage within the current research and safety standards is still relatively sparse. In addition, safety standards remain focused on functional safety and do not adequately address the specific concerns of information systems and data which indirectly contribute safety. This thesis focuses on the safety of marine navigational data and proposes methods of identifying and classifying safety related data. Endsley’s Goal Directed Task Analysis is re-used as a method to support the identification of safety related data within a hierarchy of task, information and data hazards. A safety criticality scheme is proposed which acknowledges the indirect nature of data and information system contribution to safety. Hazard analysis of the navigational <b>data</b> <b>chain</b> is proposed using HAZOP based on a proposed taxonomy of navigational data errors. Applying HAZOP to the <b>data</b> <b>chain</b> {{identified a number of}} difficulties associated with analysis of the <b>data</b> <b>chain</b> including error propagation, timeliness and the need to focus the analysis to avoid the potential for significant amounts of effort...|$|R

40|$|In {{an era of}} {{increasing}} dependence on data science and big data, the voices of one set of major stakeholders - the world's children and those who advocate on their behalf - have been largely absent. A recent paper estimates one in three global internet users is a child, yet {{there has been little}} rigorous debate or understanding of how to adapt traditional, offline ethical standards for research, involving data collection from children, to a big data, online environment (Livingstone et al., 2015). This paper argues that due to the potential for severe, long-lasting and differential impacts on children, child rights need to be firmly integrated onto the agendas of global debates about ethics and data science. The authors outline their rationale for a greater focus on child rights and ethics in data science and suggest steps to move forward, focussing on the various actors within the <b>data</b> <b>chain</b> including <b>data</b> generators, collectors, analysts and end users. It concludes by calling for a much stronger appreciation of the links between child rights, ethics and data science disciplines and for enhanced discourse between stakeholders in the <b>data</b> <b>chain</b> and those responsible for upholding the rights of children globally.

40|$|While {{questions}} related to UAS operations and use in government surveillance have been discussed at length, the legal ramifications of cybersecurity negligence and data breaches for UAS operators {{have yet to be}} addressed. In Part I, this article seeks to explore those areas by discussing the UAS <b>data</b> <b>chain.</b> Vulnerabilities in this <b>data</b> <b>chain</b> specific to UAS and in general are explored, followed by an examination {{of the state of the}} law related to the collection, use, retention, and dissemination of data. Part I concludes with an overview of current voluntary “Best Practice” documents offering guidance for collecting and managing data. Part II of this article applies Article III standing requirements and third-party liability limitations to the cybersecurity negligence and data breach issues. Existing federal law does not address liability for cybersecurity negligence or data breaches in UAS operations. This, combined with current interpretations of Article III standing requirements and a lack of a required standard of care for UAS operators to protect against cyber attack by third parties, results in the lack of a legal remedy for people whose private data is captured by drone and later compromised in a cybersecurity breach. Thus, it appears UAS operators are effectively shielded from liability for data breaches beyond the UAS operation and in flight data collection...|$|R
