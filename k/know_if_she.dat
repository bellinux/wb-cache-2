25|$|Rather than {{populate}} the film with many characters, {{as in his}} previous films, here the story focuses on the compelling relationship at its center: the actress and her kidnapper literally struggling for power and desperate for love. The film's title line Tie Me Up! is unexpectedly uttered by the actress as a genuine request. She does not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> will try to escape or not, and when she realizes she has feelings for her captor, she prefers not {{to be given a}} chance. In spite of some dark elements, Tie Me Up! Tie Me Down! can be described as a romantic comedy, and the director's most clear love story, with a plot similar to William Wyler's thriller The Collector.|$|E
25|$|Earlier in the season, Cliff had J.R. {{facing a}} {{financial}} mess, when J.R.'s plan to blackmail the Farlows into handing over John Ross, by stockpiling 5 {{million barrels of}} the Farlows' crude oil, backfired on J.R., when the market {{price of crude oil}} started to fall and fall. In order to stockpile the Farlows' crude oil, J.R. had taken out a $200,000,000 loan and used $50,000,000 worth of Ewing Oil assets as collateral. Cliff, along with Jordan Lee, Andy Bradley and Wade Luce, then worked with Vaughn Leland in order to buy into the notes owed by J.R., and they planned to foreclose. With Cliff seemingly putting one over on J.R., Miss Ellie bailed Ewing Oil out of this mess by agreeing to a deal with Clayton that Clayton would pay the price that he would have paid {{at the time that the}} oil was stockpiled. By the season's end, J.R. and Cliff's situations had turned sharply in the opposite direction, as Sue Ellen, with whom Cliff had had an off-and-on relationship, decided to return to J.R., planning to marry him again. In addition, J.R. had set a trap for Cliff by making sure that a fake geological report would convince Cliff to invest millions of dollars in buying property on supposedly oil rich land which was actually bone dry. Cliff was then fired by his mother from running Wentworth Tool & Die, due to Cliff's embezzlement of company funds. Cliff attempts suicide with an overdose of pills, and a guilt-ridden Sue Ellen rushes to his bedside as Cliff lies in a coma. J.R. tries to convince Sue Ellen that it was not anybody's fault but Cliff's for what happened, but Sue Ellen disagrees and says she does not <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> can remarry J.R. if Cliff dies. Cliff's life hangs in the balance as the season ends.|$|E

Mullally said that Declan is not prepared for the moment Kate breaks up with him and he is confused.

In an interview for Rolling Stone he explained: [...] "I didn't know what the hell I was going there for. I'm just there having a good time and hanging out with Madonna. She has her producer there and I go into the studio and I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> wanted me to talk or rap. I just go in there and start talking. I'm talking about my life and things that I have endured. I'm saying some really crazy stuff. It was really intense." ...|$|E

500|$|Television critics scribed mostly {{positive}} {{reviews for}} [...] "Stowaway". Writing for Entertainment Weekly, Ken Tucker thought Anna Torv's Nimoy impression was [...] "aces, very wry and amusing," [...] and also praised Joshua Jackson's acting {{in response to}} it. Like Tucker, Noel Murray from The A.V. Club also praised Torv and Jackson's performances, and graded the episode with a B+, explaining it [...] "was an effective episode despite all its metaphysical mumbo-jumbo [...] Dana's predicament was a legitimately tense one... As she stepped on the train, I didn't <b>know</b> <b>if</b> <b>she</b> was planning to save the passengers or send their souls a-scattering... the suspense itself was palpable". Murray however admitted that [...] "if the [...] "villain" [...] weren't so sympathetic, or if the action weren't so breathless, or if I didn't find the Bellivia material so funny, I'd probably be annoyed by the wacky way the Fringe writers have found to bring William Bell back." [...] Andrew Hanson of the Los Angeles Times noted of Torv that her [...] "cadence of her words was dead on, and his/her interactions with everyone else in Fringe Division were pitch perfect." [...] He praised other facets of the episode, including how [...] "the weekly mysteries unfold like origami", and that introducing the prime's version of the Lincoln character allowed the audience [...] "to see all the weirdness of Fringe through fresh eyes".|$|E
500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter.
