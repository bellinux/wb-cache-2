25|$|When coal, oil, natural gas, wood, or {{any other}} fuel is combusted in a stove, oven, fireplace, hot water boiler, or <b>industrial</b> <b>furnace,</b> the hot {{combustion}} product gases that are formed are called flue gases. Those gases are generally exhausted to the ambient outside air through chimneys or industrial flue gas stacks (sometimes referred to as smokestacks).|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{chimneys}} {{are commonly}} referred to as flue gas stacks and are generally external structures, as opposed to those built into the wall of a building. They are generally located adjacent to a steam-generating boiler or <b>industrial</b> <b>furnace</b> and the gases are carried to them with ductwork. Today the use of reinforced concrete has almost entirely replaced brick as a structural component in the construction of industrial chimneys. Refractory bricks are often used as a lining, particularly if the type of fuel being burned generates flue gases containing acids. Modern industrial chimneys sometimes consist of a concrete windshield with a number of flues on the inside.|$|E
500|$|Browner found {{criticism}} {{from both sides}} of environmental issues and battled many environmentalists, who objected to her support for repeal of the 1958 Delaney clause regarding permissible levels of carcinogens in foods. [...] Her announcement in May 1993 that the EPA would impose a moratorium on new incinerator and <b>industrial</b> <b>furnace</b> licensing drew support from environmentalists, however. A move by Clinton to elevate the EPA and Browner to Cabinet-level status failed in late 1993 to gain sufficient Congressional support. [...] Many of her legislative desires had to {{take a back seat to}} the higher-priority 1993 Clinton health care plan.|$|E
