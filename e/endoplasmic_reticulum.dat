5|$|Class II: LDLR is not {{properly}} transported from the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> to the Golgi apparatus for expression {{on the cell}} surface.|$|E
5|$|Many {{types of}} cells export {{proteins}} produced by ribosomes {{attached to the}} rough ER. The ribosomes assemble amino acids into protein units, which are carried into the rough ER for further adjustments. These proteins may be either transmembrane proteins, which become embedded in the membrane of the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum,</b> or water-soluble proteins, which are able {{to pass through the}} membrane into the lumen. Those that reach the inside of the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> are folded into the correct three-dimensional conformation. Chemicals, such as carbohydrates or sugars, are added, then the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> either transports the completed proteins, called secretory proteins, to areas of the cell where they are needed, or they are sent to the Golgi apparatus for further processing and modification.|$|E
5|$|Some dragonflies, such as {{the green}} darner, Anax junius, have a noniridescent blue which is {{produced}} structurally by scatter from arrays of tiny spheres in the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> of epidermal cells underneath the cuticle.|$|E
5|$|Triglyceride {{synthesis}} {{takes place}} in the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> by metabolic pathways in which acyl groups in fatty acyl-CoAs are transferred to the hydroxyl groups of glycerol-3-phosphate and diacylglycerol.|$|E
5|$|Each monomer of the serpin {{aggregate}} {{exists in}} the inactive, relaxed conformation (with the RCL inserted into the A-sheet). The polymers are therefore hyperstable to temperature and unable to inhibit proteases. Serpinopathies therefore cause pathologies similarly to other proteopathies (e.g. prion diseases) via two main mechanisms. First, the lack of active serpin results in uncontrolled protease activity and tissue destruction. Second, the hyperstable polymers themselves clog up the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> of cells that synthesize serpins, eventually resulting in cell death and tissue damage. In the case of antitrypsin deficiency, antitrypsin polymers cause the death of liver cells, sometimes resulting in liver damage and cirrhosis. Within the cell, serpin polymers are slowly removed via degradation in the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b> However, {{the details of how}} serpin polymers cause cell death remains to be fully understood.|$|E
5|$|Most lipids are {{synthesized}} in yeast {{either in}} the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum,</b> lipid particles, or the mitochondrion, {{with little or no}} lipid synthesis occurring in the plasma membrane or nuclear membrane. Sphingolipid biosynthesis begins in the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum,</b> but is completed in the Golgi apparatus. The situation is similar in mammals, {{with the exception of the}} first few steps in ether lipid biosynthesis, which occur in peroxisomes. The various membranes that enclose the other subcellular organelles must therefore be constructed by transfer of lipids from these sites of synthesis. However, although it is clear that lipid transport is a central process in organelle biogenesis, the mechanisms by which lipids are transported through cells remain poorly understood.|$|E
5|$|Prokaryotes {{have only}} one lipid bilayer- the cell {{membrane}} (also known as the plasma membrane). Many prokaryotes also have a cell wall, but the cell wall is composed of proteins or long chain carbohydrates, not lipids. In contrast, eukaryotes {{have a range of}} organelles including the nucleus, mitochondria, lysosomes and <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b> All of these sub-cellular compartments are surrounded by one or more lipid bilayers and, together, typically comprise the majority of the bilayer area present in the cell. In liver hepatocytes for example, the plasma membrane accounts for only two percent of the total bilayer area of the cell, whereas the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> contains more than fifty percent and the mitochondria a further thirty percent.|$|E
5|$|The ER has {{a central}} role in producing, processing, and {{transporting}} biochemical compounds for use inside and outside of the cell. Its membrane is the site of production of all the transmembrane proteins and lipids for most of the cell's organelles, including the ER itself, the Golgi apparatus, lysosomes, endosomes, mitochondria, peroxisomes, secretory vesicles, and the plasma membrane. Furthermore, almost all of the proteins that will exit the cell, plus those destined for the lumen of the ER, Golgi apparatus, or lysosomes, are originally delivered to the ER lumen. Consequently, many of the proteins found in the cisternal space of the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> lumen are there only temporarily as they pass on their way to other locations. Other proteins, however, constantly remain in the lumen and are known as <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> resident proteins. These special proteins contain a specialized retention signal made up of a specific sequence of amino acids that enables them to be retained by the organelle. An example of an important <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> resident protein is the chaperon protein known as BiP which identifies other proteins that have been improperly built or processed and keeps them from being sent to their final destinations.|$|E
5|$|The <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (ER) is a {{membranous}} synthesis {{and transport}} organelle {{that is an}} extension of the nuclear envelope. More than half the total membrane in eukaryotic cells is accounted for by the ER. The ER is made up of flattened sacs and branching tubules that are thought to interconnect, so that the ER membrane forms a continuous sheet enclosing a single internal space. This highly convoluted space is called the ER lumen and is also referred to as the ER cisternal space. The lumen takes up about ten percent of the entire cell volume. The <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> membrane allows molecules to be selectively transferred between the lumen and the cytoplasm, and since it is connected to the nuclear envelope, it provides a channel between the nucleus and the cytoplasm.|$|E
5|$|The thyroid hormones {{are created}} from thyroglobulin. This is a protein within the {{follicular}} space that is originally created within the rough <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> of follicular cells and then transported into the follicular space. Thyroglobulin contains 123 units of tyrosine, which reacts with iodine within the follicular space.|$|E
5|$|Vesicles {{are small}} membrane-enclosed {{transport}} units that can transfer molecules between different compartments. Most vesicles transfer the membranes {{assembled in the}} <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> to the Golgi apparatus, and then from the Golgi apparatus to various locations.|$|E
5|$|SFTPA2 genetic variants, SNPs, haplotypes, {{and other}} genetic {{variations}} {{have been associated}} with acute and chronic lung disease in several populations of neonates, children, and adults. Mutations in the SFTPA2 gene are found in patients with interstitial lung disease and lung cancer. SFTPA2 mutations also associated with pulmonary fibrosis via mechanisms that involve protein instability and <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> stress.|$|E
5|$|The {{process takes}} place in {{multiple}} stages. First, fat synthesized within the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> accumulates in droplets between {{the inner and outer}} phospholipid monolayers of the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> membrane. As these droplets increase in size, the two monolayers separate further and eventually pinch off. This leads to the surrounding of the droplet in a phospholipid monolayer that allows it to disperse within the aqueous cytoplasm. In the next stage, lipid droplets then migrate to the apical surface of the cell, where plasma membrane subsequently envelops the droplet and extrudes together with it. It fully encases the fat droplet in an additional bilayer of phospholipids. The milk fat globule thus released into the glandular lumen, measuring 3-6 μm in average diameter, is surrounded by a phospholipid trilayer containing associated proteins, carbohydrates, and lipids derived primarily from the membrane of the secreting lactocyte. This trilayer is collectively known as MFGM.|$|E
5|$|There are two distinct, though connected, {{regions of}} ER that differ in {{structure}} and function: smooth ER and rough ER. The rough <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> is {{so named because}} the cytoplasmic surface is covered with ribosomes, giving it a bumpy appearance when viewed through an electron microscope. The smooth ER appears smooth since its cytoplasmic surface lacks ribosomes.|$|E
5|$|Another {{function}} of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, {{as part of}} a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Non-inhibitory {{extracellular}} serpins also {{perform a}} wide array of important roles. Thyroxine-binding globulin and transcortin transport the hormones thyroxine and cortisol, respectively. The non-inhibitory serpin ovalbumin is the most abundant protein in egg white. Its exact function is unknown, but it is thought to be a storage protein for the developing foetus. Heat shock serpin 47 is a chaperone, essential for proper folding of collagen. It acts by stabilising collagen's triple helix whilst it is being processed in the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b>|$|E
5|$|The zona fasciculata is {{situated}} between the zona glomerulosa and zona reticularis. Cells in this layer {{are responsible for}} producing glucocorticoids such as cortisol. It is {{the largest of the}} three layers, accounting for nearly 80% of the volume of the cortex. In the zona fasciculata, cells are arranged in columns radially oriented towards the medulla. Cells contain numerous lipid droplets, abundant mitochondria and a complex smooth <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b>|$|E
5|$|All {{corticosteroid}} hormones share cholesterol as {{a common}} precursor. Therefore, {{the first step in}} steroidogenesis is cholesterol uptake or synthesis. Cells that produce steroid hormones can acquire cholesterol through two paths. The main source is through dietary cholesterol transported via the blood as cholesterol esters within low density lipoproteins (LDL). LDL enters the cells through receptor-mediated endocytosis. The other source of cholesterol is synthesis in the cell's <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b> Synthesis can compensate when LDL levels are abnormally low. In the lysosome, cholesterol esters are converted to free cholesterol, which is then used for steroidogenesis or stored in the cell.|$|E
5|$|Envelope: Some {{species of}} virus envelop {{themselves}} in a modified form {{of one of the}} cell membranes, either the outer membrane surrounding an infected host cell or internal membranes such as nuclear membrane or <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum,</b> thus gaining an outer lipid bilayer known as a viral envelope. This membrane is studded with proteins coded for by the viral genome and host genome; the lipid membrane itself and any carbohydrates present originate entirely from the host. The influenza virus and HIV use this strategy. Most enveloped viruses are dependent on the envelope for their infectivity.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear envelope, {{otherwise}} known as nuclear membrane, consists of two cellular membranes, an inner and an outer membrane, arranged {{parallel to one another}} and separated by 10 to 50 nanometres (nm). The nuclear envelope completely encloses the nucleus and separates the cell's genetic material from the surrounding cytoplasm, serving as a barrier to prevent macromolecules from diffusing freely between the nucleoplasm and the cytoplasm. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the membrane of the rough <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (RER), and is similarly studded with ribosomes. The space between the membranes is called the perinuclear space and is continuous with the RER lumen.|$|E
5|$|During the infection, {{rotavirus}} produces mRNA {{for both}} protein biosynthesis and gene replication. Most of the rotavirus proteins accumulate in viroplasm, where the RNA is replicated and the DLPs are assembled. Viroplasm is formed around the cell nucleus {{as early as}} two hours after virus infection, and consists of viral factories thought {{to be made by}} two viral nonstructural proteins: NSP5 and NSP2. Inhibition of NSP5 by RNA interference results in a sharp decrease in rotavirus replication. The DLPs migrate to the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> where they obtain their third, outer layer (formed by VP7 and VP4). The progeny viruses are released from the cell by lysis.|$|E
5|$|Serpins are {{the most}} widely {{distributed}} and largest superfamily of protease inhibitors. They were initially believed to be restricted to eukaryote organisms, but have since been found in bacteria, archaea and some viruses. It remains unclear whether prokaryote genes are the descendants of an ancestral prokaryotic serpin or the product of horizontal gene transfer from eukaryotes. Most intracellular serpins belong to a single phylogenetic clade, whether they come from plants or animals, indicating that the intracellular and extracellular serpins may have diverged before the plants and animals. Exceptions include the intracellular heat shock serpin HSP47, which is a chaperone essential for proper folding of collagen, and cycles between the cis-Golgi and the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum.</b>|$|E
5|$|Once {{inside the}} skin, dengue virus binds to Langerhans cells (a {{population}} of dendritic {{cells in the}} skin that identifies pathogens). The virus enters the cells through binding between viral proteins and membrane proteins on the Langerhans cell, specifically the C-type lectins called DC-SIGN, mannose receptor and CLEC5A. DC-SIGN, a non-specific receptor for foreign material on dendritic cells, {{seems to be the}} main point of entry. The dendritic cell moves to the nearest lymph node. Meanwhile, the virus genome is translated in membrane-bound vesicles on the cell's <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum,</b> where the cell's protein synthesis apparatus produces new viral proteins that replicate the viral RNA and begin to form viral particles. Immature virus particles are transported to the Golgi apparatus, the part of the cell where some of the proteins receive necessary sugar chains (glycoproteins). The now mature new viruses are released by exocytosis. They are then able to enter other white blood cells, such as monocytes and macrophages.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{envelope}} surrounds the nucleus, separating its contents from the cytoplasm. It has two membranes, each a lipid bilayer with associated proteins. The outer nuclear membrane is continuous with the rough <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> membrane, and like that structure, features ribosomes {{attached to the}} surface. The outer membrane is also continuous with the inner nuclear membrane since the two layers are fused together at numerous tiny holes called nuclear pores that perforate the {{nuclear envelope}}. These pores are about 120 nm in diameter and regulate the passage of molecules between the nucleus and cytoplasm, permitting some {{to pass through the}} membrane, but not others. Since the nuclear pores are located in an area of high traffic, they {{play an important role in}} the physiology of cells. The space between the outer and inner membranes is called the perinuclear space and is joined with the lumen of the rough ER.|$|E
5|$|The nuclear {{membrane}} contains a lipid bilayer that encompass {{the contents of}} the nucleus. The <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (ER) is a synthesis and transport organelle that branches into the cytoplasm in plant and animal cells. The Golgi apparatus is a series of multiple compartments where molecules are packaged for delivery to other cell components or for secretion from the cell. Vacuoles, which are found in both plant and animal cells (though much bigger in plant cells), are responsible for maintaining the shape and structure of the cell as well as storing waste products. A vesicle is a relatively small, membrane-enclosed sac that stores or transports substances. The cell membrane is a protective barrier that regulates what enters and leaves the cell. There is also an organelle known as the Spitzenkörper that is only found in fungi, and is connected with hyphal tip growth.|$|E
25|$|The <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> (ER) {{is a type}} of {{organelle}} in eukaryotic {{cells that}} forms an interconnected network of flattened, membrane-enclosed sacs or tube-like structures known as cisternae. The membranes of the ER are continuous with the outer nuclear membrane. The <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> occurs in most types of eukaryotic cells, but is absent from red blood cells and spermatozoa. There are two types of endoplasmic reticulum: rough and smooth. The outer (cytosolic) face of the rough <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> is studded with ribosomes that are the sites of protein synthesis. The rough <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> is especially prominent in cells such as hepatocytes. The smooth <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> lacks ribosomes and functions in lipid manufacture and metabolism, the production of steroid hormones, and detoxification. The smooth ER is especially abundant in mammalian liver and gonad cells. The lacy membranes of the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> were first seen in 1945 using electron microscopy.|$|E
25|$|NS4B {{is a small}} (27 kDa) {{hydrophobic}} integral {{membrane protein}} with 4 transmembrane domains. It is located within the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> and {{plays an important role}} for recruitment of other viral proteins. It induces morphological changes to the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> forming a structure termed the membranous web.|$|E
25|$|CYP17A1, in <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> of {{adrenal cortex}} has steroid 17α-hydroxylase and 17,20-lyase activities.|$|E
25|$|Flavivirus genomic RNA {{replication}} {{occurs on}} rough <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> membranes in membranous compartments.|$|E
25|$|Ceramide synthases (CerS) are {{integral}} membrane proteins of the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> that catalyze {{the synthesis of}} ceramide.|$|E
25|$|SubAB's {{target is}} in the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> of the cell and is brought into the cell through clathrin-mediated endocytosis. The glycan {{receptor}} for SubAB usually ends with an α2-3-linked N-Glycolylneuraminic acid (Neu5Gc). SubAB has an A subunit where it acts as a serine protease and cleaves Bip/GRP78, an <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> chaperone. The cleavage of this chaperone causes cellular stress through protein inhibition, and consequently death of the cell.|$|E
25|$|Secretory proteins, mostly glycoproteins, {{are moved}} across the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> membrane. Proteins that are transported by the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> {{throughout}} the cell are marked with an address tag called a signal sequence. The N-terminus (one end) of a polypeptide chain (i.e., a protein) contains a few amino acids that work as an address tag, which are removed when the polypeptide reaches its destination. Nascent peptides reach the ER via the translocon, a membrane-embedded multiprotein complex. Proteins that are destined for places outside the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> are packed into transport vesicles and moved along the cytoskeleton toward their destination. In human fibroblasts, the ER is always co-distributed with microtubules and the depolymerisation of the latter cause its co-aggregation with mitochondria, which are also associated with the ER.|$|E
25|$|The initial two {{reactions}} {{occur in}} mitochondria, the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum,</b> and peroxisomes, indicating multiple sites of synthesis in animal cells.|$|E
25|$|CYP19A (P450arom, aromatase) in <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> of gonads, brain, adipose tissue, and {{elsewhere}} catalyzes aromatization of androgens to estrogens.|$|E
25|$|In prokaryotes {{translation}} generally {{occurs at}} the point of transcription (co-transcriptionally), often using a messenger RNA that is {{still in the process of}} being created. In eukaryotes translation can occur in a variety of regions of the cell depending on where the protein being written is supposed to be. Major locations are the cytoplasm for soluble cytoplasmic proteins and the membrane of the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> for proteins that are for export from the cell or insertion into a cell membrane. Proteins that are supposed to be expressed at the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> are recognised part-way through the translation process. This is governed by the signal recognition particle—a protein that binds to the ribosome and directs it to the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> when it finds a signal peptide on the growing (nascent) amino acid chain.|$|E
25|$|Whereas HSP90AA1 and HSP90AB1 {{are located}} {{primarily}} in the cytoplasm of the cells, HSP90B1 {{can be found in}} the <b>endoplasmic</b> <b>reticulum</b> and Trap1 in mitochondria.|$|E
