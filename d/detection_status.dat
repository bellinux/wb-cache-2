40|$|The {{objective}} {{was to determine whether}} detectable levels of OP metabolites influence the relationship between BMI and cardiometabolic health. This cross-sectional study was conducted using 2227 adults from the 1999 – 2008 NHANES datasets. Urinary concentrations of six dialkyl phosphate metabolites were dichotomized to above and below the detection limit. Weighted multiple regression analysis was performed adjusting for confounding variables. Independent of BMI, individuals with detectable metabolites had higher diastolic blood pressure (for dimethylphosphate, diethylphosphate, and diethyldithiophosphate; P< 0. 05), lower HDL (for diethyldithiophosphate; P= 0. 02), and higher triglyceride (for dimethyldithiophosphate; P= 0. 05) than those below detection. Contrarily, those with detectable dimethylthiophosphate had better LDL, HDL, and total cholesterol, independent of BMI. Individuals at a higher BMI range who had detectable diethylphosphate (interaction: P= 0. 03) and diethylthiophosphate (interaction: P= 0. 02) exhibited lower HDL, while little difference existed between OP metabolite <b>detection</b> <b>statuses</b> at lower BMIs. Similarly, individuals with high BMIs and detectable diethylphosphate had higher triglyceride than those without detectable levels, while minimal differences between diethylphosphate <b>detection</b> <b>statuses</b> were observed at lower BMIs (interaction: P= 0. 02). Thus, cardiometabolic health outcome differs depending on the specific OP metabolite being examined, with higher BMIs amplifying health risk...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—In {{technologies}} {{affected by}} variability, the <b>detection</b> <b>status</b> of a small-delay fault may vary among manufactured circuit instances. The same fault may be detected, missed or provably undetectable in different circuit instances. We introduce the first complete flow to accurately evaluate and systematically maximize the test quality under variability. As {{the number of}} possible circuit instances is infinite, we employ statistical analysis to obtain a test set that achieves a fault-efficiency target with an user-defined confidence level. The algorithm combines a classical path-oriented test-generation procedure with a novel waveform-accurate engine that can formally prove that a small-delay fault is not detectable and does not count towards fault efficiency. Extensive simulation results demonstrate {{the performance of the}} generated test sets for industrial circuits affected by uncorrelated and correlated variations.

40|$|Abstract–In {{diagnostic}} testing faults detectable by test vectors are partitioned into groups. This partitioning is {{such that}} a fault is distinguishable from faults in all other groups, but is indistinguishable from those in its own group. Diagnostic fault coverage (DC) {{is defined as the}} number of fault groups divided {{by the total number of}} faults. We present a new diagnostic fault simulation algorithm that determines the DC of given test vectors and produces a fault dictionary. For each vector, we begin with detected fault list at each primary output obtained from a convetional fault simulator. For the vector being simulated each fault is assigned a detection index that uniquely specifies its <b>detection</b> <b>status</b> at all primary outputs. Fault list is then partitioned. Fault with different detection index are distinguished by the simulated vector and are kept in separate groups. Any fault in a group by itself is dropped from further simulation with subsequent vectors for which its detection index remains unknown (X). After simulation of each vector, the cumulative DC is obtained by counting the fault groups. Fault dictionary syndrome for a fault is the array of its detection indexes. ...|$|E

40|$|Abstract—One {{of the key}} {{mechanisms}} underlying {{a wireless}} sensor network (WSN) is to monitor the network itself. Many existing approaches perform centralized analysis and maintenance based on {{a large amount of}} status reports collected from the WSN, while others use add-on protocols/modules that not only require extra management cost but also interrupt the normal operations of targeted WSN applications. Unlike existing work, we propose LoMoM, a new approach of Local Monitoring and Maintenance for a WSN, which combines monitoring operations for the WSN with the operations of a mobile event monitoring, {{in a manner that is}} both energy- and latency-efficient. LoMoM includes a two-part monitoring architecture: a WSN and a 3 G network. Our main interest is in the WSN-part, where we address two important issues: monitoring probable anomalies/faults of the nodes, and the link failures. To achieve the event monitoring efficiently, LoMoM conducts a prompt local maintenance when such a fault occurs. Fault and event <b>detection</b> <b>status</b> reports are observed by a remote monitoring center using the 3 G network. Comprehensive evaluations via both simulations and real-world experiments are conducted to validate the effectiveness of LoMoM.

40|$|In {{wireless}} sensor networks, {{detection and}} tracking of continuous natured objects is more challenging owing to their unique {{characteristics such as}} uneven expansion and contraction. A continuous object is usually spread over a large area, and, therefore, {{a substantial number of}} sensor nodes are needed to detect the object. Nodes communicate with each other {{as well as with the}} sink to exchange control messages and report their <b>detection</b> <b>status.</b> The sink performs computations on the received data to estimate the object boundary. For accurate boundary estimation, nodes at the phenomenon boundary need to be carefully selected. Failure of one or multiple boundary nodes (BNs) can significantly affect the object detection and boundary estimation accuracy at the sink. We develop an efficient failure-prone object detection approach that not only detects and recovers from BN failures but also reduces the number and size of transmissions without compromising the boundary estimation accuracy. The proposed approach utilizes the spatial and temporal features of sensor nodes to detect object BNs. A Voronoi diagram-based network clustering, and failure detection and recovery scheme is used to increase boundary estimation accuracy. Simulation results show the significance of our approach in terms of energy efficiency, communication overhead, and boundary accuracy...|$|E

In this context, one needs to understand the details of the time dependent oxygen chemistry, leading to the formation of O- 2 and H 2 O. Aims. We aim to determine the degree of correlation between the occurrence of O- 2 and HOOH (hydrogen peroxide) in star-forming molecular clouds. We first detected O- 2 and HOOH in rho Oph A, we now search for HOOH in Orion OMCA, where O- 2 has also been detected. Methods. We mapped a 3 ' x 3 ' region around Orion H- 2 -Peak 1 with the Atacama Pathfinder Experiment (APEX). In addition to several maps in two transitions of HOOH, viz. 219. 17 GHz and 251. 91 GHz, we obtained single-point spectra for another three transitions towards the position of maximum emission. Results. Line emission at the appropriate LSR-velocity (Local Standard of Rest) and at the level of >= 4 sigma was found for two transitions, with lower signal-to-noise ratio (2. 8 - 3. 5 sigma) for another two transitions, whereas for the remaining transition, only an upper limit was obtained. The emitting region, offset 18 '' south of H 2 -Peak 1, appeared point-like in our observations with APEX. Conclusions.

40|$|Background: Ultrasonic {{evaluation}} of intima-media thickness (IMT) {{is an early}} marker of assessing the development of atherosclerosis and determining cardiovascular risk. To attain the best possible diagnosis, {{it is essential that}} medical images be clear, sharp and without noise and artifacts. Objectives: Comparison of speckle reducing anisotropic diffusion (SRAD), discrete (DTD) and continuum topological derivative (CTD) on B-mode ultrasound images of common carotid and brachial arteries throughout the cardiac cycle. Patients and Methods: In a cross-sectional design, an examination was performed on forty-two human subjects {{with a mean age of}} 44 Â± 6 years from April 2013 to June 2013. This study was approved by the ethics committees of Kashan University of Medical Sciences and Beheshti Hospital. An ultrasonic examination of common carotid and brachial arteries of forty-two human subjects was performed. The program was designed in MATLAB software to extract consecutive B-mode images and apply region of interest (ROI) on the IMT of the common carotid and brachial arteries. Then, three different noise reduction filters with the Canny edge detection were used in ROI separately. Finally, the program measured the image quality metrics. Results: According to values of eleven different image quality metrics (mentioned in the main text), there was a significant difference between CTD, DTD and SRAD filters with the Canny edge <b>detection</b> <b>status</b> in the common carotid and brachial arteries throughout the cardiac cycle (all P values < 0. 001). For example, peak signal to noise ratios (PSNR) using CTD, DTD and SRAD filters were 95. 43 Â± 0. 64, 88. 86 Â± 0. 82 and 73. 02 Â± 0. 20 in common carotid and 96. 39 Â± 1. 25, 92. 58 Â± 0. 11 and 88. 27 Â± 0. 63 in brachial arteries, respectively (both P values < 0. 001).

Within three retrospective comparison studies, a full sample of N= 445 men was recruited from the community, who self-reported sexual fantasies involving prepubescent and pubescent children. Via clinical interviews and questionnaires sexual preference, sexual offenses, <b>detection</b> <b>status</b> and previously identified risk factors for sexual offending (sexual self-regulation deficits, offense supportive cognitions, socio-affective deficits) have been assessed. Study I compared men, who self-reported CSA (with or without additional CP offending) with those, who denied CSA. Based on recent activity, Study II compared men who had committed CP only or CSA offenses {{in the past six months}} with men, who remained offense-free during the same period. Based on lifetime offense history (excluding the most recent six months) CP only offenders were compared with CSA offenders and men, who had committed both kinds of offenses. Study III compared men who admitted current or previous investigation or conviction by legal authorities (detected offenders) with those who denied any detection for their sexual offenses against children (undetected offenders). Group comparisons (detected vs. undetected) were further conducted for each offense type separately (CP only offenders, CSA only offenders, mixed offenders). Overall, there were more similarities than differences between groups. Indicators of sexual self-regulation deficits could not be identified as a risk factor for CP offending, though detected offenders scored higher on related measures. Men, who denied CSA offenses or undetected CP only offenders, scored higher on measures of social functioning compared to undetected CSA and detected CP offenders. Groups by offending behavior did not differ on emotional deficits. However, undetected compared to detected offenders were characterized by a more emotion oriented coping style...|$|E
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2014 This study {{describes}} the short-term {{natural history of}} vaginal human papillomavirus (HPV) and the epidemiology of oral and fingernail HPV among mid-adult women. From 2011 - 2012, 409 30 - 50 year-old women were recruited and followed for 6 months. Women completed surveys on health and behaviors and provided self-collected vaginal samples (monthly) and oral/fingernail specimens (enrollment and exit) for type-specific PCR-based HPV DNA testing. HPV-positive vaginal samples were tested for viral load. Enrollment blood specimens were tested for type-specific HPV antibodies. In chapter 1, we describe the relationship between host and viral factors and repeat high-risk (HR) HPV detection. HPV viral load (adjusted [a]RR per one log 10 increase in viral load= 1. 10; 95 %CI: 1. 05, 1. 16) and current smoking (aRR= 1. 24; 95 %CI: 0. 96, 1. 59) were each positively associated with the proportion of type-specific HR HPV detections over follow-up, whereas incident (versus prevalent) <b>detection</b> <b>status</b> (aRR= 0. 28; 95 %CI: 0. 20, 0. 39) and history of pregnancy (aRR= 0. 83; 95 %CI: 0. 68, 1. 0) were negatively associated. Risk factors {{were similar to those}} previously identified for long-term persistence, suggesting that short-term persistence may relate to long-term persistence. In chapter 2, we describe the incidence of, and risk factors for, newly detected type-specific HR HPV stratified by type-specific HPV serostatus. Six-month cumulative incidence of HR HPV was higher when there was serologic evidence of prior infection with the same type (2. 6 %) than when there was not (1. 3 %). Recent sexual behaviors were associated with incident HPV detection among women without serologic evidence of prior infection only, suggesting that incident detection is more likely due to reactivation or intermittent detection of persisting infection when serologic evidence of prior infection is present. In chapter 3, we evaluated the frequency of, and risk factors for oral and fingernail HPV. Prevalence of genital HPV types detected in the oral cavity (2. 5 %) and fingernails (3. 8 %) were low. Concurrent vaginal infection with the same HPV type was strongly associated with both oral (OR= 10. 29; 95 %CI: 3. 34, 31. 72) and fingernail (OR= 104. 33; 95 %CI: 30. 44, 357. 5) HPV detection. Results suggest that DNA deposition between anatomic sites is plausible, though oral and fingernail HPV detection may be unlikely to serve a key role in genital HPV transmission...|$|E

There is an exception to this rule: if a further shock is detected in the satellite data, the detection will be logged as a satellite detection and the routine for magnetic data will continue to search for SSCs within the expected period, and if one with an exceptionally high probability (P_SSC > 95) is detected, a further storm report will be produced announcing a new Storm, and the “stormy” status will be extended for a further 24  h. This probability was chosen after analysis of the results from our test storm detector, where there were many SSCs that followed initial SSCs less than 24  h after. These were found to always have a probability greater than 95 [...]...|$|R
