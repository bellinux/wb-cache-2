The concept {{is based on a}} theoretical model considering a magnetron as a forced oscillator and experimentally verified with a 2. 5 MW pulsed magnetron. To fulfill fast control of phase and output power requirements of SC accelerators, both two-stage injection-locked CW magnetrons are combined with a 3 -dB hybrid. Fast control in output power is achieved by varying the input phase of one of the magnetrons. For output power up to 250 kW we expect the output/input power ratio to be about 35 to 40 dB in CW or quasi-CW mode with long pulse duration.

This is motivated by the possible {{reduction in the number}} of RF chains and analog-to-digital converters.

In this paper, we propose hybrid architectures based on switching networks to reduce the complexity and the power consumption of the structures based on phase shifters. We define a power consumption model and use it to evaluate the energy efficiency of both structures. To estimate the complete MIMO channel, we propose an open loop compressive channel estimation technique which is independent of the hardware used in the analog processing stage.

In order to overcome the severe propagation loss of mmWave channel, mmWave multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems with analog/digital hybrid precoding and combining transceiver architecture have been widely considered.

40|$|Millimeter-wave (mmWave) {{communications}} {{plays an}} important role for future cellular networks because of the vast amount of spectrum available in the underutilized mmWave frequency bands. To overcome the huge free space omnidirectional path loss in those frequency bands, the deployment of {{a very large number of}} antenna elements at the base station is crucial. The complexity, power consumption and costs resulting from the large number of antenna elements can be reduced by limiting the number of RF chains. This leads to hybrid precoding and combining, which, in contrast to the traditional fully digital precoding and combining, moves a part of the signal processing from the digital to the analog domain. This paper proposes new algorithms for the design of <b>hybrid</b> precoders and <b>combiners</b> in a multiuser scenario. The algorithms are based on the previously proposed Linear Successive Allocation method developed for the traditional fully digital version.

40|$|The design, simulation, and {{characterization}} {{of a novel}} Ka-band (32. 05 0. 25 GHz) rectangular waveguide two-way branch-line <b>hybrid</b> unequal power <b>combiner</b> (with port impedances matched {{to that of a}} standard WR- 28 waveguide) has been created to combine input signals, which are in phase and with an amplitude ratio of two. The measured return loss and isolation of the branch-line hybrid are better than 22 and 27 dB, respectively. The measured combining efficiency is 92. 9 percent at the center frequency of 32. 05 GHz. This circuit is efficacious in combining the unequal output power from two Ka-band GaAs pseudomorphic high electron mobility transistor (pHEMT) monolithic microwave integrated circuit (MMIC) power amplifiers (PAs) with high efficiency. The component parts include the branch-line hybrid-based power combiner and the MMIC-based PAs. A two-way branch-line hybrid is a four-port device with all ports matched; power entering port 1 is divided in phase, and into the ratio 2 : 1 between ports 3 and 4. No power is coupled to port 2. MMICs are a type of integrated circuit fabricated on GaAs that operates at microwave frequencies, and performs the function of signal amplification. The power combiner is designed to operate over the frequency band of 31. 8 to 32. 3 GHz, which is NASA's deep space frequency band. The power combiner would have an output return loss better than 20 dB. Isolation between the output port and the isolated port is greater than 25 dB. Isolation between the two input ports is greater than 25 dB. The combining efficiency would be greater than 90 percent when the ratio of the two input power levels is two. The power combiner is machined from aluminum with E-plane split-block arrangement, and has excellent reliability. The flexibility of this design allows the combiner to be customized for combining the power from MMIC PAs with an arbitrary power output ratio. In addition, it allows combining a low-power GaAs MMIC with a high-power GaN MMIC. The arbitrary port impedance allows matching the output impedance of the MMIC PA directly to the waveguide impedance without transitioning first into a transmission line with characteristic impedance of 50 ohms. Thus, by eliminating the losses associated with a transition, the overall SSPA efficiency is enhanced. For reducing the cost and weight when required in very large quantities, such as in the beam-forming networks of phased-array antenna systems, the combiner can be manufactured using metal-plated plastic. Two <b>hybrid</b> unequal power <b>combiners</b> can be cascaded to realize a non-binary combiner (for e. g., a three-way) and can be synergistically optimized for low VSWR (voltage standing wave ratio), low insertion loss, high isolation, and wide bandwidth using commercial off-the-shelf electromagnetic software design tools...|$|R

The convergence of the proposed algorithms is proved using the monotonic boundary theorem and fractional programming theory.

Economical and energy efficient analog/digial hybrid precoding and combining transceivers have been often proposed for mmWave massive multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) systems to overcome the severe propagation loss of mmWave channels. One major shortcoming of existing solutions lies in the assumption of infinite or high-resolution phase shifters (PSs) to realize the analog beamformers. However, low-resolution PSs are typically adopted in practice to reduce the hardware cost and power consumption.
