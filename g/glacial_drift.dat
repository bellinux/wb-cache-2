5|$|The Itcha Range is the {{smallest}} shield volcano in the Anahim Volcanic Belt in terms of area covered. Unlike the Rainbow and Ilgachuz ranges, the Itcha Range is composed of small coalescing volcanic units rather than a stratiform volcanic pile. It is, in many respects, similar to the small alkaline shields found in Kenya and Ethiopia along the East African Rift. About 60% of the shield is exposed while roughly 40% of it remains buried under <b>glacial</b> <b>drift</b> deposits. This suggests that the Itcha Range was glaciated repeatedly during the Pleistocene epoch. Glacial striae on polished surfaces {{of some of the}} oldest volcanic rocks {{in the eastern part of}} the shield and the local presence of drift deposits throughout the stratigraphy indicate that glaciation and volcanism were contemporaneous through much of the volcanic history of the Itcha Range.|$|E
5|$|In {{more recent}} times, massive ice sheets {{at least one}} {{kilometer}} thick ravaged {{the landscape of the}} state and sculpted its terrain. The Wisconsin glaciation left 12,000 years ago. These glaciers covered all of Minnesota except the far southeast, an area characterized by steep hills and streams that cut into the bedrock. This area is known as the Driftless Zone for its absence of <b>glacial</b> <b>drift.</b> Much of the remainder of the state outside the northeast has 50feet (15m) or more of glacial till left behind as the last glaciers retreated. Gigantic Lake Agassiz formed in the northwest 13,000 years ago. Its bed created the fertile Red River valley, and its outflow, glacial River Warren, carved the valley of the Minnesota River and the Upper Mississippi downstream from Fort Snelling. Minnesota is geologically quiet today; it experiences earthquakes infrequently, {{and most of them are}} minor.|$|E

50|$|As the ice sheets melted, the thinner Fraser Lobe {{began to}} float while the Strait of Georgia lobe {{acted as a}} dam forming a lake under the Fraser Lobe.

40|$|One of {{the major}} issues in (palaeo-) {{climatology}} is the response of Antarctic ice sheets to global climate changes. Antarctic ice volume has varied {{in the past but}} the extent and timing of these fluctuations are not well known. In this study, we address the question of amplitude and timing of past Antarctic ice level changes by surface exposure dating using in situ produced cosmogenic nuclides (10 Be and 21 Ne). The study area lies in the Ricker Hills, a nunatak at the boundary of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet in southern Victoria Land. By determining exposure ages of erratic boulders from <b>glacial</b> <b>drifts</b> we directly date East Antarctic Ice Sheet variations. Erosion-corrected neon and beryllium exposure ages indicate that a major ice advance reaching elevations of about 500 m above present ice levels occurred between 1. 125 and 1. 375 million years before present. Subsequent ice fluctuations were of lesser extent but timing is difficult as all erratic boulders from related deposits show complex exposure histories. Sample-specific erosion rates were on the order of 20 – 45 cm Ma- 1 for a quartzite and 10 – 65 cm Ma- 1 for a sandstone boulder and imply that the modern cold, arid climate has persisted since at least the early Pleistocene...|$|R

40|$|A {{series of}} {{distinct}} glacial deposits flanking {{the margins of}} the upper Hatherton Glacier, an outlet glacier in the central Transantarctic Mountains, are used to constrain the behaviour of the Antarctic ice-sheets. Cosmogenic exposure ages of 18 erratics from four <b>glacial</b> <b>drifts</b> covering the ice free Dubris and Bibra valleys, range in age from 5 to 1997 ka. Our results document four glacial advance and retreat events superimposed on an overall long-term ice thickness reduction of about 500 m since the mid-Pleistocene. The lack of field evidence and absence of LGM exposure ages in the glacial deposits of the Hatherton Glacier supports our conclusion that at the LGM the East Antarctic Ice Sheet was of similar size, or may have been slightly smaller, than present. Minimum exposure ages from the oldest two glacial events, represented by the Isca and Danum drifts, are ∼ 1 – 2 Ma and ∼ 0. 5 Ma respectively. The Britannia-II Drift, previously assumed to mark the maximum extent of the Last Glacial Maximum advance, has a mean 10 Be age of 126 ± 3. 2 ka (n = 5). Ages from the younger Britannia-I Drift suggest that since the mid-Holocene (6. 5 ± 1. 2 ka, n = 5), approximately 200 m of additional ice has been lost. © 2013, Elsevier Ltd. © 2013, Elsevier Ltd...|$|R
40|$|Hydrogeophysical {{surveys were}} carried out in a 3. 2 [*]km 2 Scottish {{catchment}} where previous isotope studies inferred significant groundwater storage that makes important contributions to streamflow. We used electrical resistivity tomography (ERT) to characterize the architecture of <b>glacial</b> <b>drifts</b> and make an approximation of catchment-scale storage. Four ERT lines (360 – 535 [*]m in length) revealed extensive 5 – 10 [*]m deep drift cover on steeper slopes, which extends up to 20 – 40 [*]m in valley bottom areas. Assuming low clay fractions, we interpret variable resistivity as correlating with variations in porosity and water content. Using Archie 2 ̆ 7 s Law as a first approximation, we compute likely bounds for storage along the ERT transects. Areas of highest groundwater storage occur in valley bottom peat soils (up to 4 [*]m deep) and underlying drift where up to 10 [*] 000 [*]mm of precipitation equivalent may be stored. This is consistent with groundwater levels which indicate saturation to within 0. 2 [*]m of the surface. However, significant slow groundwater flow paths occur in the shallower drifts on steeper hillslopes, where point storage varies between 1000 [*]mm– 5000 [*]mm. These fluxes maintain saturated conditions in the valley bottom and are recharged from drift-free areas on the catchment interfluves.

40|$|Did {{the volume}} of the Antarctic ice cover {{fluctuate}} synchronously to the past climate changes that occurred in the northern hemisphere? Or have the southern ice sheets remained unaffected by these partly abrupt warming and cooling events? The glacial deposits at the margin of the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS) reflect volume changes of the inland ice in the past. We have mapped glacial landforms on nunataks and in other ice-free areas along the Transantarctic Mountains within an project ongoing since 1996. The result is a series of 1 : 250, 000 scale geomorphological and glaciological maps showing in detail the distribution of glacier and sea ice features, glacial, periglacial, aeolian and weathering landforms and deposits. At least five <b>glacial</b> <b>drifts</b> at different elevations have been differentiated and correlated over large areas. In addition, we have dated erosional and depositional glacial features at selected sites by surface exposure dating with in-situ produced cosmogenic He- 3 and Ne- 21. At the Ricker Hills, situated 100 km inland west from the Ross Sea coast, we obtain new exposure ages ranging between 160 and 680 ka. The combination of mapping and dating allows the conclusion that the EAIS did undergo surface level changes throughout the Pleistocene, but that these have been of limited amplitude, up to 500 m on Ricker Hills. This agrees with findings from further north in Northern Victoria Land. More datings from the same and other sites are in progress...|$|R
40|$|Along {{the south}} coast of Ireland, a shelly diamict facies, the Irish Sea Till, has been {{variously}} ascribed to subglacial deposition by a grounded Irish Sea glacier or to glacimarine sedimentation by suspension settling and iceberg rafting. Observations are presented here from five sites {{along the south}} coast to directly address this question. At these sites, sedimentary evidence is preserved for the onshore advance of a grounded Irish Sea glacier, which glacitectonically disturbed and eroded pre-existing sediments and redeposited them as deformation till. Recession of this Irish Sea glacier resulted in the damming of ice-marginal lakes in embayments along the south coast, into which glacilacustrine sedimentation then took place. These lake sediments were subsequently glacitectonised and reworked by overriding glacier ice of inland origin, which deposited deformation till {{on top of the}} succession. There is no evidence for deposition of the Irish Sea diamicts by glacimarine sedimentation at these sites. The widespread development of subglacial deforming bed conditions reflected the abundance of fine-grained marine and lacustrine sediments available for subglacial erosion and reworking. Stratigraphical and chronological data suggest that the advance of a grounded Irish Sea glacier along the south coast occurred during the last glaciation, and this is regionally consistent with marine geological data from the Celtic Sea. These observations demonstrate extension of glacier ice far beyond its traditional limits in the Celtic Sea and on-land in southern Ireland during the last glaciation, and remove the stratigraphical basis for chronological differentiation of surficial <b>glacial</b> <b>drifts,</b> and thus the Munsterian Glaciation, in southern Ireland...|$|R

40|$|The {{research}} I {{describe in}} this thesis was under taken in the years from 1959 to 1963 {{with the aim of}} elucidating the physiographic history of central Leicestershire during the Pleistocene period. I have directed relatively little attention to the phases of erosion, albeit of the Pleistocene age, which preceded the deposition of the earliest drift, for to have done so adequately would have involved study of a much wider area than is now encompassed. Instead attention has been concentrated on the events leading firstly to the accumulation of the drifts and secondly to their dissection. These are the two major themes of the thesis, but they are preceded by a brief introductory chapter outlining the present physique of the area, its solid geology, and the history of previous research. Such is the complexity of the <b>glacial</b> <b>drifts</b> that I can lay no claim to have made either an exhaustive or a definitive study; "the balance of probability" is liable to be an over-worked phrase. It is believed that much {{of the value of the}} thesis lies in bringing together descriptions of a large number of sections in the Pleistocene deposits. To this end Chapter two is largely descriptive, and as far as possible interpretation has here been eschewed. A further aspect of the thesis stemming from this is that the area considered in Chapters two, three and four is sharply circumscribed. The boundaries are artificial, and certain topics are discussed in two parts; considerable cross referencing is the result, and for inconvenience to the reader I apologize. The justification lies in the obvious risks arising from not differentiating clearly between areas known in vastly different detail...|$|R
40|$|We {{report on}} the {{effectiveness}} of using magnetic measurements in the search for meteorites on the Antarctic ice sheet, which is thus far the Earth’s most productive terrain. Magnetic susceptibility measurements carried out with a pocket meter (SM 30) during the 2003 / 04 PNRA meteorite collection expedition to northern Victoria Land (Antarctica) proved to be a rapid, sensitive, non-destructive means for the in situ identification, pairing, and classification of meteorites. In blue ice fields characterized by the presence of moraines and <b>glacial</b> <b>drifts</b> (e. g., Miller Butte, Roberts Butte, and Frontier Mountain), magnetic susceptibility measurements allowed discrimination of meteorites from abundant terrestrial stones that look like eteorites thanks to the relatively high magnetic susceptibility of the former with respect to terrestrial rocks. Comparative measurements helped identify 16 paired fragments found at Johannessen Nunataks, thereby reducing unnecessary duplication of laboratory analyses and statistical bias. Following classifications schemes developed by us in this and previous works, magnetic susceptibility measurements also helped classify stony meteorites directly in the field, thereby providing a means for selecting samples with higher research priority. A magnetic gradiometer capable of detecting perturbations in the Earth’s magnetic field induced by the presence of meteorites was an efficient tool for locating meteorites buried in snow along the downwind margin of the Frontier Mountain blue ice field. Based on these results, we believe that magnetic sensors should constitute an additional payload for robotic search for meteorites on the Antarctic ice sheet and, by extension, on the surface of Mars where meteorite accumulations are predicted by theoretical works. Lastly, magnetic susceptibility data was successfully used to crosscheck the later petrographic classification of the 123 recovered meteorites, allowing the detection of misclassified or peculiar specimens...|$|R

Our study focuses on northern Victoria Land (NVL), where an articulated glacial system behaves with its own dynamics, independently from the East Antarctic Ice Sheet (EAIS). A regional landscape analysis, based on glacial geologic and geomorphologic surveys and mapping, was conducted to investigate NVL glacial history {{in order to assess}} the relationship between EAIS and NVL glacial system. Through detailed field traverses in NVL, we identified and classified several geomorphologic units and <b>glacial</b> <b>drifts</b> offering valuable archives of past environmental changes and glacial advances. The polar environment endured in NVL since at least 7. 5 – 8 Ma (and even before when considering the EAIS region). In such a highly conservative setting, surface exposure dating (SED) has proven to be highly valuable in order to establish a precise chronology of the landscape features. Through field observations in ice- free areas at the borders of outlet, valley and local glaciers, as well as in nunataks at the margin of the EAIS are combined with cosmogenic data from erosional surfaces and erratic boulders. Our data indicate several ice fluctuations, providing valuable insights into the paleoclimatic evolution of the study area.
