Norman explained this by Owen's excessive workload in this period, including several administrative functions, polemics with fellow-scientists and the study of a large number of <b>even</b> <b>more</b> <b>interesting</b> newly discovered extinct animals, such as Archaeopteryx. Norman also pointed out that Owen in 1861 suggested a lifestyle for Scelidosaurus that is very different from present ideas: it would have been a fish-eater and partially sea-dwelling.|$|E

The move was initiated keeping in mind the 2015 World Cup that Australia and New Zealand were to host. The previous edition of the Ashes was played in England in July 2013 with England emerging comfortable winners. England had won the previous three editions of the Ashes and were tipped to win this edition as well. They were looking to emulate a feat {{that had not been}} achieved since the 1890s, win four Ashes on the trot. Simply going by Australia's performances in the recent past, it was assumed that the result was a foregone conclusion. Australia's batting was clearly found wanting in the previous series and they had lost matches from seemingly comfortable situations, as was seen in Durham and Lord's. The series had was also shadowed by the controversy surrounding Stuart Broad's refusal to walk in the previous series after clearly edging Ashton Agar to Michael Clarke in the first test at Trent Bridge.

Allegations of redlining- the refusal of lenders to make mortgages or their imposition of more onerous terms on mortgagors because of (noneconomic) bias related to the location of the property- are of quite recent origin. Before the early 1970 s, the term, redlining, was used almost exclusively to describe an alleged practice by insurers of drawing a red line around sections of. a city to delineate an area within which they would not write policies. While mortgagees (and others) had been accused of discriminating against borrowers solely because of their race, national origin, sex, and age, the term "redlining " was not employed to describe these deplorable practices. By now the term is used as a general pejorative description of some institution’s alleged refusal to serve some area or even group (e. g., "credit card redlining " and "Hispanic redlining’).
