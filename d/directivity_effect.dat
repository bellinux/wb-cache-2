Source modeling {{of the earthquake}} by simulating strong ground motions is important for predicting strong ground motions and understanding their generation mechanism. Researchers have conducted source process analyses of the earthquake. For example, Yagi et al. (2016) and Yamanaka (2016) estimated the source process using teleseismic records. Koketsu (2016), Asano and Iwata (2016), Kubo et al. (2016), and Nozu (2016) used strong ground motions. These analyses indicated that the rupture propagated mainly toward the northeast from the hypocenter, and the rupture extended almost {{as far as the}} western edge of Mount Aso. This kind of rupture propagation can cause the rupture <b>directivity</b> <b>effect,</b> where seismic waves are coherently superposed. In the 2016 Kumamoto earthquake, strong motions observed northeast of the epicenter could be amplified by the forward <b>directivity</b> <b>effect.</b> Strong ground motion simulations using point-source models do not seem appropriate for such earthquakes. However, the pseudo point-source model proposed by Nozu (2012 a) has been successfully applied to large earthquakes such as the 2011 Tohoku earthquake (Nozu 2012 a) as well as shallow crustal earthquakes (Hata and Nozu 2014), although the source model does not consider the rupture <b>directivity</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

The model {{is supposed to}} demonstrate the following features in the far-field body waves: 1) the omega-square high-frequency (HF) behavior of displacement spectra; 2) lack of the <b>directivity</b> <b>effect</b> in HF radiation; and 3) a stochastic nature of the HF signal component. The model involves two stochastic elements: the local stress drop (SD) on a fault and the rupture time function (RT) with a linear dominant component. The goal {{of the present study}} is to investigate the Gusev model theoretically and to find conditions for (1, 2) to be valid and stable relative to receiver site. The models with smooth elements SD, RT are insufficient for these purposes. Therefore SD and RT are treated as realizations of stochastic fields of the fractal type. The local smoothness of such fields is characterized by the fractional (Hurst) exponent H, 0 < H < 1. This allows us to consider a wide class of stochastic functions without regard to their global spectral properties. We show that the omega-square behavior of the model is achieved approximately if the rupture time function is almost regular (H~ 1) while the stress drop is rough function of any index H. However, if the rupture front is linear, the local stress drop has to be function of minimal smoothness (H~ 0). The situation with the <b>directivity</b> <b>effect</b> is more complicated: for different RT models with the same fractal index, the effect may or may not occur. The nature of the phenomenon is purely analytical. The main controlling factor for the directivity is the degree of smoothness of the two dimensional distributions of RT random function. For this reason the <b>directivity</b> <b>effect</b> is unstable. This means that in practice the opposite conclusions relative to the statistical significance of the <b>directivity</b> <b>effect</b> are possibleComment: 42 pages, 2 figure...|$|E

In this study we simulate time histories in Memphis, Tennessee, and St. Louis, Missouri, for M 7. 5 and M 8. 0 earthquakes along two faults in the New Madrid seismic zone. Simulations are based on a well-established and calibrated finite-fault simulation program (FINSIM), which has been shown to reproduce ground motions for earthquakes of M 4 – 8 in eastern and western North America (Beresnev and Atkinson, 2001 a). Simulations are made for representative soil profiles for each city, as well as for reference bedrock conditions (at the base of the soil profile); the effect of nonlinearity on soil amplification is considered for the soil sites. Uncertainty in the results is considered by modeling a wide range of alternative scenarios, representing the major uncertainties in input parameters. The total uncertainty in ground motions (response spectra) is about a factor of 2. Results are most sensitive to magnitude, hypocenter location (<b>directivity</b> <b>effects),</b> and maximum slip velocity. The resulting time histories and spectra for all modeled scenarios are available as an electronic supplement to this article. Results are validated to the extent possible using the modified Mercalli intensity (MMI) observations from the 1811 – 1812 earthquakes. The simulated motions are consistent with MMI observations at St. Louis and Memphis. It is not possible to distinguish, based on the MMI observations, which of the M 7. 5 or M 8. 0 scenarios are most likely.

The seismological hierarchy implied by these dependencies allows the logarithmic excita-tion functional to be exactly and uniquely decomposed into a series of uncorrelated terms that include zero-mean averages of the site, source, hypocenter, and source-complexity effects. We use this averaging-based factorization to compare the Cyber-Shake prototype hazard model developed by the Southern California Earthquake Center, CS 11, with the empirical ground-motion prediction equations (GMPEs) of the 2008 Next Generation Attenuation (NGA 08) project. For horizontal-response spec-tral accelerations at long periods (2 – 10 s), the basin and <b>directivity</b> <b>effects</b> of CS 11 are substantially larger than those of the NGA 08 GMPEs. Directivity–basin coupling and other 3 D wave propagation effects not represented in the GMPEs contribute signifi-cantly to the excitation patterns in CS 11. The total variance of the CS 11 excitations is about 60 % higher than the NGA root mean square (rms) at the 2 s period but almost 30 % lower at 10 s. Relative to theNGA rms, the residual variance in CS 11 at 2 s is larger than the aleatory variability in the NGA 08 database by a factor of nearly 1. 6. Recent CyberShake experiments with alternative source and structural models suggest that the high CS 11 variances are due to an overestimation of the basin and <b>directivity</b> <b>effects</b> at short periods.

40|$|Abstract A hybrid deterministic-stochastic method (DSM) is {{developed}} to cal-culate synthetic time series of ground accelerations radiated from an extended source. The main {{goal of the}} proposed methodology is {{to include in the}} classical point-source stochastic method (PSSM) the effects of the rupture propagation on a finite fault. This purpose is achieved through two important modifications of the PSSM technique. First, the envelope does not have a predetermined functional form; rather, it is calculated deterministically following the isochron formulation with a kinematic rupture model. Second, we have generalized the various parameters of the point-source ground motion spectrum to account for the extended fault: corner frequency, distance from the fault, and radiation pattern are evaluated through the kinematic modeling. The guiding principal in all these modifications has been to develop a robust methodology capable of capturing the complexity of near-source ground mo-tion even when input information about earthquake source, propagation medium, and site characteristics are of a very schematic nature. We show that the synthetic envelope contains the required information on the rupture process on extended fault, such as <b>directivity</b> <b>effects</b> and azimuthal variations depending on the source-to-receiver geometry. The method’s capability is demon-strated by modeling strong ground motions of the 1992 Mw 7. 3 Landers, California, earthquake and comparing them with the recorded accelerograms, which are clearly affected by <b>directivity</b> <b>effects.</b> The proposed technique reproduces the main charac-teristics of strong-motion recordings, and can be implemented using {{only a limited number of}} parameters to describe the source (dimension and geometry), the propa-gation medium (wave velocities and layers), and the site effects (transfer function).

These variations become significant at {{a period of}} 0. 6 second and generally grow in size with increasing period. We have developed modifications to empirical strong ground motion attenua-tion relations {{to account for the}} <b>effects</b> of rupture <b>directivity</b> on strong motion amplitudes and durations. The modifica-tions are based on an empirical analysis of near-fault data. The ground motion parameters that are modified include the average horizontal response spectral acceleration, the duration of the acceleration time history, and the ratio of strike-normal to strike-parallel spectral acceleration. The parameters upon which the adjustments oaverage horizon-tal amplitude and duration depend are the fraction of the fault rupture that occurs {{on the part of the}} fault that lies between the hypocenter and the site, and the angle between the fault plane and the path from the hypocenter tothe site. Since both of these parameters can be derived from the hypocenter location and the fault geometry, the model of rupture <b>directivity</b> <b>effects</b> on ground motions that we have developed can be direcdy included in probabilistic seismic hazard calculations.

Considering the source models with a propagating pulse and a finite rise-time, we assume that within the slipping band, the rupture has some random character, with small scale rupture in various directions.

Aftershocks obtained from high-quality local network (Aktar et al., 2006 in review) generally are aligned along an ENE-WSW direction, however they also revealed activation of NE-SW trending structures, close to the epicenter of the 1 st event, which imply sinistral strike-slip sense of motion. Thus, the identification of the fault plane, at least for this event, is crucial for the interpretation of the sequence. As the distribution of aftershocks was puzzling, because {{it is not clear whether}} the NE-SW aftershocks cloud should be considered as off-fault aftershocks, or aftershocks related to the fault plane, here we explore the presence of any <b>directivity</b> <b>effects</b> related to the propagation of these events that would shed light to the identification of the fault plane. Thus, at first we estimate source time functions through an empirical Green's function approach to examine the variation of their shape with azimuth around the source and afterwards we invert their shapes to examine the spatial and temporal distribution of the slip on the main fault. Due to the location of these events at the cross-boundary between Greece and Turkey we used broadband records from the National Seismographic Networks of both countries that provided adequate coverage in azimuth of the activated area. The shape of the source time functions (STF's) of the first event of 17 October 2005, 05 : 45 UTC, Mw 5. 4, exhibit clear directivity towards SW, which strongly implies that from the two nodal planes the NE-SW trending one is the fault plane, whereas the STF's for the stations lying on the north and south of the epicenter are similar, exhibiting no <b>directivity</b> <b>effects.</b> No clear <b>directivity</b> <b>effects</b> were observed for the two other strong events of the sequence.

40|$|Based on the Next Generation Attenuation (NGA) project ground motion library, {{the finite}} element model of the {{high-speed}} railway vehicle-bridge system is established. The model was specifically developed for such system that is subjected to near-fault ground motions. In addition, it accounted for {{the influence of the}} rail irregularities. The vehicle-track-bridge (VTB) element is presented to simulate the interaction between train and bridge, in which a train can be modeled as a series of sprung masses concentrated at the axle positions. For the short period railway bridge, the results from the case study demonstrate that <b>directivity</b> pulse <b>effect</b> tends to increase the seismic responses of the bridge compared with far-fault ground motions or nonpulse-like motions and the <b>directivity</b> pulse <b>effect</b> and high values of the vertical acceleration component can notably influence the hysteretic behaviour of piers...|$|R
40|$|Using a {{model of}} a complex fault system, we examine the initiation, propagation, and {{termination}} of ruptures and their relationship to fault geometry and shaking hazard. We find concentrations of epicenters near fault step overs and ends; concentrations of terminations near fault ends; and persistent propagation <b>directivity</b> <b>effects.</b> Taking advantage of long sequences of dynamic events, we directly measure shaking hazards, such as peak ground acceleration exceedance probabilities, without need for additional assumptions. This provides a new tool for exploring shaking hazard from a physics-based perspective, its dependence on various physical parameters, and its correlation with other geological and seismological observables. Using this capability, we find some significant aspects of the shaking hazard can be anticipated by measures of the epicenters. In particular, asymmetries in the relative peak ground motion hazard along the faults appear well correlated with asymmetries in epicentral locations...|$|R
