The young lady has plucked her hairline to increase the expanse, and thus elegance, of <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> a lock of hair falls at the back in a ponytail. A tight-fitting cap covers her ears, a fashion possibly due to the prevalent belief {{of the time that}} the Virgin Mary conceived through the ear.|$|E

After he helps the locals, Ginko is asked by the innkeeper {{to look at her}} granddaughter, Maho, who is deaf, has horns on <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> hears strange noises.

5|$|Chhinnamasta {{may have}} a lolling tongue. Her hair is loose and dishevelled and {{sometimes}} decorated with flowers. Alternately, in some images, her hair is tied. Additionally, she is described as having a third eye on <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> a jewel on her forehead, which is tied to a snake or a crown on the severed head. The crescent moon may also adorn her head. Chhinnamasta is depicted wearing a serpent as the sacred thread and a mundamala (garland of skulls or severed heads and bones), along with other various gold or pearl ornaments around her neck. Bangles and waist-belt ornaments may be also depicted. She may also wear a snake {{around her neck and}} serpentine earrings.

5|$|Madonna {{lies down}} on a pew and has a dream in which she is falling through space. Suddenly, a woman, {{representing}} power and strength, catches her. She advises Madonna {{to do what is}} right and tosses her back up. Still dreaming, Madonna returns to the statue, which transforms into the black man she had seen earlier. He kisses <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> leaves the church as she picks up a knife and cuts her hands, bleeding. Interspersing scenes show Madonna singing and dancing wildly in front of burning crosses, erotic scenes between her and the saint, and the singer being surrounded by a choir inside the church. Madonna wakes up, goes to the jail and tells the police that she had witnessed the crime and that the black man is innocent; the police release him. The video ends as Madonna dances in front of the burning crosses, and then everybody involved in the story line takes a bow as curtains come down on the set.|$|E
5|$|The {{first call}} from the scene to {{emergency}} services was received at 10:11a.m. While waiting for help to arrive, Giffords' intern Daniel Hernández Jr. applied pressure to the gunshot wound on <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> made sure she did not choke on her blood. Hernández was credited with saving Giffords' life. David and Nancy Bowman, a married doctor and nurse who were shopping in the store, immediately set up triage and attended to nine-year-old Christina-Taylor Green. Police {{arrived on the scene}} at 10:15a.m., with paramedics arriving at 10:16a.m. Badger observed the assailant attempting to discard a small bag containing money and identification, which was recovered by the officers. Following the shooting, the police shut down roads surrounding the shopping center until late in the day. The intersection was cordoned off and most of the businesses in the shopping center were closed throughout the weekend during the initial investigation. The Safeway store reopened a week later, with a makeshift memorial erected near the front of the store.|$|E

25|$|Until {{the turn}} of the last century, an Iyer widow was never allowed to remarry. Once her husband dies, an Iyer woman had to tonsure her head. She had to remove the kunkumam or the {{vermilion}} mark on <b>her</b> <b>forehead,</b> <b>and</b> was required to smear her forehead with the sacred ashes. All these practices have, however, greatly dimimished with the enactment of reforms.|$|E

The priest will use a special ladle to proffer the holy ash to the layperson, who in turn daubs it on his or <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> eyelids, and may take some home for use after a Kushti ceremony.|$|E
500|$|Jaci Stephen of the Daily Mail {{felt that}} Mercedes {{was one of}} [...] "the two sexiest people in Hollyoaks", that {{infidelity}} is part of her [...] "family's standards", that [...] "Mercedes all but has the word 'slapper' tattooed on <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> looks as guilty as the Pope in a brothel" [...] {{and that it was}} unfortunate that Mercedes would not [...] "disappear into the sunset at 100mph". Stephen commented that there were not [...] "many occasions when Mercedes fails to get her kit off for {{at least one of the}} lads [...] This time, Carl's the victim/lucky recipient (depending on your viewpoint) when he sets out to prove that Mercedes is a slut. Blimey. With her track record, how much proof does anyone need?" [...] Stephen commented on Mercedes and Jacqui saying that if they [...] "started charging for sex - they'd never worry about money again. It would be a busman's holiday for them. They could even make it a family business - slappersRus.com". Stephen questioned whether Mercedes would [...] "get her perfect wedding" [...] and then answered, [...] "Expect gunmen/bombs/fights/ murders. Get her to the church on time, but make sure there’s a getaway car waiting, too". When Mercedes was kidnapped, Stephen said that Mercedes was [...] "very unlucky with being centre-siege". Stephen added that [...] "Still, she's been in more terrifying situations – actually, she's only been in terrifying situations. Any chance of her just enjoying a double espresso once in a while?" [...] Stephen's colleague Caroline Fitton commented on Mercedes' doubts about whether she could bring Bobby up alone saying it was [...] "entirely understandable" [...] due to Mercedes being unable to restrain from regularly [...] "changing clothes, cosmetics, jobs or men – let alone children". Stephen felt that due to Mercedes' recent behaviour she would have to chloroform her new boyfriend, adding that to Mercedes a [...] "bloke's a bloke, conscious or unconscious".|$|E
5000|$|Like other Simberg works, the {{atmosphere}} is melancholic: the angelic central figure with <b>her</b> bandaged <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> bloodied wing, the sombre clothing of her two youthful bearers. The direct gaze of the right-hand figure touches the viewer.|$|R

2500|$|Vajrayoginī is visualized as the translucent, {{deep red}} {{form of a}} 16-year-old female with the third eye of wisdom set {{vertically}} on <b>her</b> <b>forehead</b> <b>and</b> unbound flowing hair.
