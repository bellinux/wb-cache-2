5|$|In 1981, Fischer {{stayed at}} the home of {{grandmaster}} Peter Biyiasas, where, over a period of four months, he defeated Biyiasas seventeen times in a series of speed games. In an interview with Sports Illustrated reporter William Nack, Biyiasas assessed Fischer's play:He was too good. There was no use in playing him. It wasn't interesting. I was getting beaten, and it wasn't clear to me why. It wasn't like I made this mistake or that mistake. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was being gradually outplayed, from the start. He wasn't taking any time to think. The most depressing thing about it is that I wasn't even getting out of the middle game to an endgame. I don't ever remember an endgame. He honestly believes there is no one for him to play, no one worthy of him. I played him, and I can attest to that.|$|E
25|$|I {{used to have}} {{to punch}} a time clock at Columbia. Every day of my life. That's what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> was under {{exclusive}} contract, like they owned me… I think he had my dressing room bugged… He was very possessive of me as a person, he didn't want me to go out with anybody, have any friends. No one can live that way. So I fought him… You want to know what I think of Harry Cohn? He was a monster.|$|E
500|$|The sole Kenyan athlete at the Games, Philip Boit, {{competed in}} the men's 10 {{kilometre}} classical cross-country skiing. The competition took place on 12 February, at the Snow Harp venue in Hakuba, Nagano. The beginning of the race was chaotic, with the skiers beset by heavy rain. Boit {{was not prepared to}} race on wet snow, and later attributed it as the reason for falling down on several occasions. He found that it added further complications, adding [...] "Going uphill, the skis were collecting snow. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> had put on high heeled-shoes!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Really, madam," [...] {{said the}} Prince, [...] "I {{wish you would}} leave off {{mentioning}} my nose. It cannot matter to you what <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> <b>am</b> quite satisfied with it, and have no wish to have it shorter. One must take what is given one." ...|$|R
50|$|Next to the Foundation {{is another}} {{monument}} which honors Captain Roberto Rodriguez, known as “El Vaquerito” (little cowboy), a young soldier {{who died in}} the Battle of Santa Clara. When notified of his death, revolutionary leader Che Guevara said: “Today <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> have lost 300 men”.|$|R
60|$|Yes, I am the {{sleeping}} volcano, and one morning, monsieur, I have suffered the eruption. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> this. <b>I</b> shall tell you.|$|R
500|$|In 2013, Gore {{became a}} vegan. He had earlier {{admitted}} that [...] "it's absolutely correct that the growing meat intensity of diets {{across the world}} {{is one of the}} issues connected to this global crisis – {{not only because of the}} [...] involved, but also because of the water consumed in the process" [...] and some speculate that his adoption of the new diet is related to his environmentalist stance. In a 2014 interview, Gore said [...] "Over a year ago I changed my diet to a vegan diet, really just to experiment to see what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> ... <b>I</b> felt better, so I've continued with it and I'm likely to continue it for the rest of my life." ...|$|E
500|$|I don't want to {{escalate}} it because I like Madonna, [...] She's been {{to my house}} for dinner. It {{was something that was}} said {{in the heat of the}} moment, and probably should not have been said. [...] Would I apologize to her if I saw her? Yeah, because I don't want to hurt any artist's feelings. It was my fault. I instigated the whole thing. But it applies to all those bloody teenage singers. [...] The reaction to it was so hysterical, <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> said, 'I think all gays should be killed or I think Hitler was right.' I just said someone was lip-synching. I'm not afraid to speak my mind. I'm not going to mellow with age. I get more enraged about things as I get older because you see that these injustices go on.|$|E
500|$|The {{favourite}} for the race, Bjorn Daehlie of Norway won {{the gold}} medal, but {{instead of going to}} the podium to collect it, he was informed that Boit was still racing – the only competitor left on the course, down in 92nd place. Daehlie waited for Boit to finish, welcoming him as he passed the finish line. Boit was amazed by the crowd's reaction as he arrived, [...] "They were shouting 'Kenya GO!, Philip GO!' <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was winning a medal even though I was last." [...] As he crossed the line some 20 minutes after Daehlie, the Norwegian hugged the Kenyan – while Boit later said that he immediately thanked Daehlie, the gold medallist insisted that Boit instead remarked that he would beat him at the next Olympics. The incident received worldwide attention.|$|E
6000|$|... "No," [...] he said slowly, [...] "I cannot let <b>it</b> <b>be</b> <b>like</b> that. <b>I</b> {{have learned}} to love you and you only, and I thought that you had known it." ...|$|R
3000|$|Haluk: “I think so, {{because if}} <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> Turkey… <b>I</b> mean, whomever I ask in Turkey, {{they say they}} are doing {{academic}} lyceum. I ask myself—are these people that smart? Or is there no system?” [...]...|$|R
6000|$|... "Talking of girls," [...] said Marlowe with enthusiasm. [...] "I've {{just seen}} {{the only one}} in the world that really amounts to anything. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> this. <b>I</b> <b>was</b> shoving my way through the mob on the dock, when suddenly...." ...|$|R
500|$|Kim Manners later {{noted that}} [...] "Theef" [...] was {{difficult}} to shoot because {{the cast and crew}} had inadequate time to prepare. He explained, [...] "It was kind of a rush thing and we got the script very late. We were totally winging it while we were shooting it". Manners later stated that the episode [...] "came together" [...] in the editing room: [...] "When I looked at the footage, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was looking at somebody else's film. But it cut together real nice and the end result was that 'Theef' {{turned out to be a}} decent little episode". Manners later admitted that the episode was his only credit for the series during which he experienced illness. With Manners out for a day due to his sickness, Rob Bowman took over directing duties for a day.|$|E
500|$|In 1999, {{director}} Stanley Kubrick's {{death and}} the Columbine High School massacre occurred within months of each other; Ledonne credited the two events with changing his life. After seeing A Clockwork Orange, Ledonne discovered that film could comment on culture; after the Columbine shootings, {{he realized he was}} headed down the same path as the shooters. [...] "It was a bit scary, once I learned more about these boys, because <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was looking in the mirror and I didn't want the same fate for myself," [...] Ledonne said. He began taking martial arts, studying film, and saw a therapist. By the time he graduated from Alamosa High School, Ledonne had a 4.0 grade point average and was voted [...] "most likely to succeed" [...] by his peers. He studied film at Emerson College and moved back to Colorado to form his own production company, Emberwild Productions, which mostly edits wedding videos.|$|E
500|$|Oakley, Inc. {{provided}} the red-lensed glasses worn by Cyclops, a customized {{version of the}} company's own X-Metal Juliet. Wolverine's claws required no cast of Hugh Jackman's hands, and were built so he could easily put them on and take them off for safety reasons. Production had insisted that they be attached at all times under a full prosthetic sleeve but designer Gordon Smith refused to do it. Production also insisted on real metal blades, which Smith also refused to do, making injection-moulded plaster blades instead. Hundreds of pairs were built for Jackman and his stunt doubles. Rebecca's wore 110 individual silicone prosthetic, Only the edges were glued, the rest were self-sticking. The prosthetics were built flat and wrapped her body. They were internally colored with food coloring and needed additional makeup or paint. The original agreed to and tested design was, to color her skin with cosmetic grade food coloring as well, which looked remarkable, says Gordon Smith, {{but at the last}} minute Bryan Singer insisted on painting her skin to look opaque, as in the comic book, which added 6 hours to the makeup, making the ordeal very difficult for her. [...] There were also no facilities provided to exhaust paint fumes, during one of Canada's colder winters. Romijn reflected, [...] "I had almost no contact {{with the rest of the}} cast; <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was making a different movie from everyone else. It was hell." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He's the {{blacksmith}} what owns the shanty where I live. You see, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> this: <b>I</b> allers sold him a paper every afternoon, an' when it rained, or business was dull, I loafed 'round there, an' that's how I found the place." ...|$|R
6000|$|... ‘Your Highness,’ replied Clara, ‘I {{must begin}} with thanks; <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> what <b>I</b> have heard of you, that you should thus take up {{the case of the}} unfortunate; and as for my Harry, he is worthy of all that you can do.’ She paused.|$|R
3000|$|We {{did a lot}} of {{residential}} work growing up. At first I only watched and then I was allowed to wield tools. My parents remodeled the home and I was finally allowed to wield tools. <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> “Look, <b>I</b> can make something out of this!” [...]...|$|R
2500|$|In a July 1995 {{interview}} with Playboy magazine, Gibson said President Bill Clinton was a [...] "low-level opportunist" [...] and someone was [...] "telling {{him what to}} do". He said that the Rhodes Scholarship was established for {{young men and women}} who want to strive for a [...] "new world order" [...] and this was a campaign for Marxism. Gibson later backed away from such conspiracy theories saying, [...] "It was like: 'Hey, tell us a conspiracy'...so I laid out this thing, and suddenly, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was talking the gospel truth, espousing all this political shit like I believed in it." [...] In the same 1995 Playboy interview, Gibson argued against ordaining women to the priesthood.|$|E

2500|$|In 2004, Canadian tech-metal band Out of Your Mouth {{released}} a cover version of [...] "Music" [...] as their debut single. Vocalist Jason Darr commented, [...] "I absolutely love her, I've bought her records {{and when she}} came out with that song <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was hit over the head with it". In 2007, The Dynamics {{released a}}n eight-minute soul cover on their album Versions Excursions. French metal band Eths added a cover of the song as a bonus track on their third studio album III (2012). In addition, remixed eurodance cover versions of the song have appeared on the Dancemania series albums, including an uptempo cover remix by Nancy And The Boys on the 2001 album Dancemania Speed 6.|$|E

60|$|Now James {{began to}} be sick, but I think the cause thereof was fear; so his mother gave him some of that glass of spirits that she had given her at the Interpreter's house, {{and three of the}} pills that Mr. Skill had prepared, and the boy began to revive. Thus they went on, till they came to about the middle of the Valley, and then Christiana said, Methinks I see {{something}} yonder upon the road before us, a thing of such a shape such as I have not seen. Then said Joseph, Mother, what <b>is</b> <b>it?</b> An ugly thing, child; an ugly thing, said she. But, mother, what <b>is</b> <b>it</b> <b>like?</b> said he. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> cannot tell what, said she. And now <b>it</b> <b>was</b> but a little way off; then said she, <b>It</b> <b>is</b> nigh.|$|R
2500|$|Slug also dislikes some of {{the songs}} that he wrote before and does not perform them live, such as [...] "Vampires" [...] from 2002 album God Loves Ugly. Daley has stated, [...] "when I did get my phase of trying to figure myself out, {{there was a lot}} of tug-of-war inside of me between wanting to hate a {{particular}} woman and then feeling guilty about that. And there’s certain songs that I won’t perform anymore, because the game of tug-of-war is over and I know where I’m at". Furthermore, Slug has criticized Atmosphere's first album Overcast!, saying: [...] "It's obvious that I’m trying so fucking hard on Overcast and you can see through it and tell it's not a person it's more of an attempt at trying to fill the niche, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like</b> <b>I</b> was trying to prove to myself that I was a rapper." ...|$|E

5000|$|Ruffin stated [...] "When I got {{the song}} from Martyn, I knew <b>it</b> <b>was</b> a better song than he realised. I thought right, I will sing this sang so well, that this girl won't {{be able to}} do <b>it.</b> <b>It</b> <b>was</b> <b>like,</b> OK, <b>I</b> don't mind doing a guide vocal, but it'll be so good that they'll have to use it." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, I didn't know, Mely, child," [...] {{said the}} old woman. [...] "I didn't know what <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>like.</b> <b>I</b> hain't never been to one, and you can't be too keerful where you go, {{in a place like}} New York." ...|$|E
