50|$|The Microsoft Natural Keyboard is an <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboard</b> for computers, {{introduced}} in 1994. It {{was designed for}} Microsoft by Ziba Design. The keyboard was a split keyboard with each half of the keyboard separated and tilted upwards and down {{from the center of}} the keyboard. This key arrangement was ergonomically designed to prevent carpal tunnel syndrome and other repetitive strain injuries associated with typing for long periods of time. Another innovation was the integrated wrist pad helping to ensure correct posture while sitting at the computer and further reducing strain on the neck, arms and wrists.This keyboard also introduced three new keys purposed for Microsoft's upcoming operating system: two Windows logo keys between the Ctrl and Alt keys on each side, and a Menu key between the right Windows and Ctrl keys.Although it was not the first <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboard,</b> it was the first widely available sub-$100 offering. The keyboard gained popularity quickly, selling over 600,000 per month at its peak.|$|E
50|$|It {{is claimed}} that an <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboard</b> may reduce muscle strain and reduce risk of carpal tunnel {{syndrome}} or other kinds of repetitive strain injury, but one {{should be aware that}} many “ergonomic” keyboards change the musculoskeletal region exposed to risk, instead of eliminating hazardous postures. Manufacturers also claim that after a user takes the time to adjust to this style of keyboard, they can increase typing speed.|$|E
50|$|Originally, Gruenbaum {{planned to}} trigger the samchillian via a {{traditional}} piano style keyboard, but with remapped functions, but later decided for functional and aesthetic reasons, to switch to an <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboard</b> made by Kinesis. Some touch sensitivity was sacrificed, but spatial access to intervals was greatly reduced. Via MIDI, the samchillian {{has been able to}} control any number of digital sound sources, but also analog sources such as acoustic player pianos.|$|E
50|$|The {{lock keys}} are {{scattered}} around the keyboard. Most styles of keyboards have three LEDs indicating which locks are enabled, in the upper right corner above the numpad. Some <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboards</b> instead place the lock indicators in between the key split. Some brands of keyboards have a function mode key (also called F mode or Office Lock), and may replace the scroll lock indicator with an office lock indicator. Office Lock, when enabled, will enable alternate functions of the function keys, meant for use with various word processing or email programs.|$|R

40|$|This article {{uses the}} lens of {{computer}} writing injuries to explore writing as an embodied activity. We use philosopher Mark Johnson 2 ̆ 7 s five-part definition of embodiment to develop an analysis that examines the physical, flesh-and-blood aspects of writing {{in addition to the}} social and cultural aspects of embodied activity. With this framework, we show the limits of purely technological solutions to writing injuries (like <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboards)</b> and explore the difficulties of including somatic training in the writing classroom. Rather than prescribing a single solution, we propose that these injuries require multifaceted infrastructural changes, and point to the benefits of approaching writing with mindfulness. We conclude by suggesting ways that writing instructors and scholars can use this framework to rethink the role of the body in writing activity...|$|R
50|$|There are {{a growing}} number of {{performing}} Samchillian Tip Tip Tip Cheeepeeeee players, primarily concentrated in the New York/New Jersey area. Among them are jazz organist Brian Charette, Rodney Clarke, Adrian Romero, and Vernon Reid. Adrian Romero has recorded a number of pieces on the samchillian, for his solo vocal records, under his instrumental electronic cut-up moniker Radiomen Roar, (notably the track Son Of Samchillian,) and with the band Ünderbelly formed with ex-Blue Öyster Cult drummer Albert Bouchard. In 2010, Charette, Clarke, and Romero performed together with Leon Gruenbaum and percussionist Shawn Banks, improvising an entire performance where all bass lines, chords, loops, samples, and solos were played on samchillians, ("4 Samchillian Jam.") Gruenbaum, Charette, and Clarke use split <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboards</b> manufactured by Kinesis, while Romero uses an old Mac G3 remote keyboard.|$|R
50|$|In the {{management}} of CTS, workstation modification (i.e., adapting the work environment) is {{a large part of}} the intervention. By adjusting the workstation equipment, such as desks, chairs, monitors, and keyboards, the ideal position of the wrist and forearm can be achieved. This can help alleviate symptoms of CTS as well as prevent further damage and strain. For example, there is moderate evidence that a modified <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboard</b> is more effective than a regular keyboard at relieving symptoms of CTS. The addition of forearm supports can help to facilitate appropriate posture of the wrist by preventing extension while using a mouse.|$|E
50|$|Maltron {{manufactures}} several {{models of}} keyboards, in {{varying levels of}} adaptation. Lillian Malt's original invention and the company's flagship design known as the Fully Ergonomic 3D Keyboard is the most highly adapted; it incorporates a curved surface for the keyboard, in which the keys' angles and depth are staggered {{to compensate for the}} different lengths and placement of the fingers. An integral trackball mouse is a customer-selectable option at additional cost. Other keyboard types available are single hand keyboards which are ergonomically designed to be used by only the left or right hand, a flat version of the fully <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboard,</b> a keyboard designed to be used by a single digit or head stick or mouth stick, and a robust expanded keyboard designed primarily to assist people with cerebral palsy. Maltron keyboards are electrically compatible with IBM PC keyboards and Apple Macintosh keyboards, using USB connectors. Earlier connectors included DIN and PS2 but these are now discontinued.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2005, Microsoft {{introduced}} the Natural <b>Ergonomic</b> <b>Keyboard</b> 4000. This keyboard provides a significantly changed ergonomic design, including an integrated leatherette wrist rest, noticeably concave key banks, and a removable front stand to help straighten {{the wrist and}} allow the fingers to drop naturally onto the keys. The multimedia keys have again been redesigned, and the home/end key location set has been fixed by returning to the standard 2×3 horizontal rectangular layout. The F Lock key now defaults to [...] "on", providing the original function key features rather than the new [...] "enhanced" [...] functions, and retains its setting across reboots. The 4000 has the indicator lights for Caps lock, etc. moved back to between the banks of keys, although they are now below the Space bar, rather than above. The 4000 is also significantly quieter to type on, with less of the distinctive [...] "click clack" [...] noise that is common with older keyboards. The space bar, however, has been reported by several reviewers to be unusually noisy and difficult to depress. The 4000 is available in two variants, Business and Retail. The exact differences are not known, although product descriptions imply that the packaging is different, and prices are often slightly higher for the Business edition.|$|E
40|$|Standard {{keyboards}} can {{be difficult}} to use for single-handed typists. They might find that typing is laborious, time consuming, and inefficient. Single-handed typists might range from having carpal tunnel in one hand, spasticity, limited motor control to a chronic irritation or loss of the fingers or the hand. When people think of solutions for single-handed typists, they tend {{to think in terms of}} alternate keyboards and keyboard layouts. However there are many additional products that will assist a one-handed user. One-handed keyboarding has many solutions and concerns to be considered. No single solution will fit all needs and preferences that individuals may have. As with any solution, exploring choices will point to the one most likely to meet individual needs. Preventing further injury and enabling proficiency at the keyboard are primary concerns and goals. Types of keyboards include chorded keyboards, right-handed/left-handed keyboards, hand-held <b>keyboards</b> and <b>ergonomic</b> <b>keyboards...</b>|$|R
