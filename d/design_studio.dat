We assume that Multimedia-Panorama can bring significant contributions to <b>design</b> <b>studios.</b> It can follow all design process stages: the recognition {{and analysis of the}} site and surrounding landscape; the organization of references; the first idea and its conception; the development of the project; and its final presentation. The strenght of panoramas in <b>design</b> <b>studios</b> is particularly enhanced by interactivity. This paper aims to demonstrate new possibilities in the association of panorama’s space recognition characteristic to the architecture design process. [Full paper in Portuguese...|$|R

5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley <b>design</b> <b>studio</b> was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, partly because of the model's aging and partly because of competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) internal competition within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E

5|$|The game {{includes}} heavily stylized {{opening and}} ending cinematics produced {{in part by}} Pete Candeland of Passion Pictures, with help from animator Robert Valley and background visuals from Alberto Mielgo. Candeland, {{who is known for}} his work animating Gorillaz videos, also produced the opening cinematics for both the original Rock Band and Rock Band 2. Within two and a half minutes, the opening cinematic provides a brief representative history of the band interspersed with numerous references to songs by The Beatles, followed by more metaphorical scenes reflecting their studio albums. Prior to each of the chapters in the game's Story mode, the game presents short introductory animations; these animations were prepared by graphic <b>design</b> <b>studio</b> MK12, who had previously worked on the opening cinematics for movies such as Stranger than Fiction and Quantum of Solace.|$|E

5|$|Unlike most {{special schools}} in Singapore, which place little {{emphasis}} on academics, Pathlight School {{uses the same}} academic curriculum as mainstream primary and secondary schools. The sole exception is that mother tongue lessons are replaced with classes covering social and life skills. The school accommodates {{the needs of students}} with smaller class sizes, staff trained to handle autistic children, more visual teaching methods, more predictable environments and individual education plans for each student. Satellite classes and special events give students regular opportunities to interact with neurotypical (non-autistic) peers from mainstream schools; exceptional students are allowed to attend classes with mainstream students for some subjects. To prepare students for employment, Pathlight School runs computing courses, a <b>design</b> <b>studio</b> and a cafe staffed by students. The school also produces book compilations of thoughts written by students, conducts exhibitions of student artwork and sells merchandise made by students, to help students develop useful skills, raise funds for the school and raise awareness of autism. In addition, Pathlight School has hosted autism events such as the WeCAN Learning Congress 2010, where over 20 international experts shared their best practices in autism care with about 560 delegates.|$|E
5|$|Vehicle Sound for Pedestrians or VSP is a Nissan-developed warning {{sound system}} in {{electric}} vehicles. The Nissan Leaf {{was the first}} car manufactured by Nissan to include VSP, and the electric car includes one sound for forward motion and another for reverse. The VSP was also used in the Nissan Fuga hybrid launched in 2011. The system developed makes a noise easy to hear for those outside {{to be aware of}} the vehicle approaching, but the warning sounds do not distract the car occupants inside. Nissan explained that during the development of the sound they studied behavioral research of the visually impaired and worked with cognitive and acoustic psychologists, including the National Federation of the Blind, the Detroit Institute of Ophthalmology, experts from the Vanderbilt University Medical Center and a Hollywood sound <b>design</b> <b>studio.</b>|$|E
