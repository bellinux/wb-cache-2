40|$|Magister Scientiae - MScCoal {{provides}} for 77 % of South Africa’s primary energy needs {{and is therefore}} a major resource that supports the socio-economic needs of South African citizens. Power stations are the major consumers of coal in South Africa and produces electricity from burned coal. The burning of coal produces a large volume of ash that is disposed {{in the form of}} ash dump systems. The ash dump system is treated with high salinity process water from the power station for dust suppression. The process water contains salts due to evaporation processes from the recirculation of water in the cooling water system. Various studies to evaluate the sustainability of the ash dump system as a sustainable salt sink were therefore conducted. This study aimed to develop a conceptual model for the ash dump system by evaluating the movement of the process water trough the ash dump and the impacts it might have on the underlying weathered dolerite aquifer. This was achieved by evaluating the <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transport</b> properties of the ash dump system. An initial site conceptual model was first established prior to the application of the <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transport</b> methods. The initial conceptual model was based on the literature, previous reports and an initial site walk over. Known and tested <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transport</b> methods were applied n bo. th field and laboratory scale for the saturated part of the ash dump system. The laboratory experiments comprised of column and core experiments. These methods assisted in parameter estimation of <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transport</b> properties and also assisted in the planning of the field experiments. The field experiments were conducted in the form of slug tests, tracer dilution and natural gradient divergent tracer test experiments. The combined laboratory and field experiments provided statistically significant values that were then used as inputs into the conceptual model. Field experiments were also applied to a surrogate aquifer that represented the underlying shallow weathered dolerite aquifer of the ash dump system. The components of the updated conceptual model identified and investigated include the physical environment, the calculated <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transport</b> properties. The ash dump can be conceptualized as a 20 to 30 meter high heap of consolidated clay size ash particles built on top of an underlying shallow weathered dolerite aquifer. The ash dup is directly connected to the underlying weathered dolerite aquifer. The saline water within the saturated zone has the ability to move through the ash dump system with hydraulic conductivities ranging between 10 - 1 - 10 - 2 m/day, with flow velocities of 7 - 8 m/day and effective porosities of 1 %- 2 %. The hydraulic properties of the ash dump are, amongst others, controlled by the ash geology, contact time of the process water with the sh and show a significant reduction in hydraulic conductivity over time, before reaching a steady state. The transport properties are controlled by advection and spreading in available pathways. Results for the surrogate underlying fractured rock aquifer show flow velocities of 31 m/day and an effective porosity of 1 %. This suggests that the underlying weathered dolerite aquifer is vulnerable to process water contamination from the ash dump system. The study illustrates the importance of a site conceptual model before the application of investigative methods. Hence having a site conceptual model provides an excellent platform for <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transport</b> estimation. The development of a site conceptual model enhanced the understanding of flow and transport movement of the processed water trough the ash dump, it also assisted as a beneficial tool to enhance ash dump management.

40|$|The Campine Plateau {{in northeastern}} Belgium, {{a remnant of}} an {{alluvial}} fan deposited by the Meuse River during the mid-Pleistocene, is characterised {{by the presence of}} boulders with maximum dimensions of up to 2 m, embedded in a gravel matrix. These boulders originated in the Ardennes region and are generally assumed to have been transported by ice-rafting processes. This paper investigates for the first time quantitatively the possibility of purely <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transport</b> of the boulders, taking into account channel and flow characteristics in the boulder provenance area during the mid-Pleistocene. Empirical transport relations that describe incipient motion thresholds in nonuniform river beds {{as a function of the}} relative grain size, or the ratio between the grain size of interest and the median grain size of the channel bed, are applied in order to calculate critical water depths for transport of boulders of various sizes. Results indicate that <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transport</b> of boulders with intermediate diameters < 1 m could have occurred within limited reaches of the palaeoriver, more specifically in the palaeo-Amblève tributary; whereas the small slope gradient of the palaeo-Meuse most probably inhibited boulder movement by hydraulic forces only. Although calculations of the ice volume required to lift a boulder to the water surface and comparison of the ice floe's dimensions with palaeochannel morphology do suggest that ice rafting is theoretically possible, several alternative, more probable transport mechanisms for the larger boulders of the Campine Plateau are proposed, requiring much smaller critical ice volumes and water depths than ice-rafting processes or purely <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transport.</b> These hypotheses include decreased bed friction and effective boulder density caused by a limited ice layer attached to the river bed and the boulder, hence lowering <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transport</b> thresholds, as well as the formation of ice jams and dams inducing catastrophic flooding and mechanical impacts by ice floes upon failure. status: publishe...|$|E

An effective element model will sharply reduce the cost and complexity of large scale simulations to bring these to manageable levels. Stochastic analysis is a powerful tool which can determine the <b>hydraulic</b> and <b>transport</b> characteristics of intersecting sets of statistically defined fractures. <b>Hydraulic</b> and <b>transport</b> characteristics are required to develop representative elements.

The variance of hydraulic conductivity induces dispersion into the transport process. The simplest of fracture systems, a single set of parallel fractures, is treated to demonstrate the usefulness of stochastic analysis. Explicit equations for conductivity of an element are developed and the dispersion characteristics are shown.

40|$|The authors {{consider}} {{the problem of}} conveyance of non-spherical solid particles in an open rectangular channel. The process of glass container manufacturing is accompanied by formation of waste glass at 1150 [...] . 1350 °С. As a result, hot glass mass flows into cold water and transforms into glass granules. Granules {{are used in the}} production of glass, and they can be loaded back into the industrial furnace. At this stage, there arises a problem of conveyance of waste glass granules into the gallery, {{in the direction of the}} furnace. The pipeline-based method requires an engine, which will increase the cost of glass containers. Hydraulic transportation of waste glass is a cheaper method. In this connection, there is a practical problem of identifying the slope angle sufficient for the transportation of waste glass in an open rectangular channel. Thus, we must determine the hydraulic characteristics of the two-phase flow to solve the problem. A laboratory research of the particle size distribution pattern was conducted in 2011 at the glass factory in operation in the Tula region. The shape of particles and the condition of the glass surface affect the parameters of their hydraulic transportation. These characteristics are taken into account when calculating the formula and introducing the correction coefficient. The problem of determining the slope of the open channel needed to transport waste glass into the glass melting furnace can be formulated as follows. What should be the angle of the bottom of the channel for <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transport</b> of waste glass, when the particle speed reaches its critical value? The input data are as follows: channel length - 70 meters, cross-section area - 1. 4 m 2. <b>Hydraulic</b> <b>transport</b> of waste glass is produced under the influence of gravity, due to the difference in the height of the upper and lower points of transportation.

Little is known about how conifer trees adjust their {{structural}} morphology at lower treeline as they experience increased drought-conditions with decreasing elevation. We hypothesized that as elevation decreases, <b>hydraulic</b> <b>transport</b> capability decreases, because trees design their xylem structure more for safety against cavitation rather than for transport efficiency under drier conditions. To test this hypothesis, branch samples were collected from Rocky Mountain Douglas-fir trees (Pseudotsuga menziesii var. glauca) along an elevation gradient from 1700 m elevation to 2100 m elevation. Cross sections were then sliced off of the Douglas-fir tree branches and placed onto microscope slides.
