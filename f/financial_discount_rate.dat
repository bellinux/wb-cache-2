The {{purpose of this study is}} to propose the Revenue-Beta Model of obtaining a <b>financial</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> for PPI projects, especially road-related projects implemented by a BTO scheme with the following assumption: The Korean government can be considered as a risk-averse investor that can build a portfolio with each toll plaza on the Korean expressways. The most significant issue in this research is whether it is reasonable and practical to apply the Capital Asset Pricing Model to get an appropriate <b>financial</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> for PPI projects. As an example, the model is applied to a real BTO project: the CN Expressway project...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{sets out}} to {{identify}} {{the correlation between the}} variations in spending and revenue as the investment progresses through time and the evolution of the <b>financial</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> and of the net present value; it also seeks a method for computing the probability of reaching a certain value. The project’s performance indicators are established at the “ 0 ” moment, when costs and revenues are estimated for the entire life of the project. It would be useful for any investor, even if they are local administrations, to follow the actual evolution of their investments as they develop through time. The positive or negative deviations from the performance indicators can determine the investor to adopt tailored decisions for each particular case in order to maintain a minimum set-performance for the project...|$|E
40|$|The {{development}} of transport infrastructure {{is critical to}} boost the economic growth in developing countries. However, transport infrastructure is capital-intensive and public funds are limited. In this context, private sector participation {{should be encouraged to}} decrease the burden of the governments in terms of financing. Indonesia is the fourth most populated country in the world and its economy has been steadily growing during the last decade. Nevertheless, the country faces several challenges due to the underdeveloped and irregular distribution of transport infrastructure around the country. The Master Plan for Acceleration and Expansion of Indonesia's Economic Development (MP 3 EI) includes the construction of thousands of kilometers of roads. PPPs are expected {{to play an important role}} in the implementation of this Plan. In this sense, the government holds a proactive approach and as a result, a regulatory framework for PPPs has been established. The main objective of this dissertation is to determine whether toll road projects are economically and financially viable in Indonesia and, consistently define the most suitable financing schemes to be adopted. A Cost Benefit Analysis (CBA) has been conducted in order to assess the economic welfare gain, as well as to conclude whether this projects would be commercially feasible. One of the most attractive sections of the Trans Sumatra toll road, in terms of traffic forecast and initial investment, has been analyzed for this purpose. The relevant economic impacts have been identified, monetized, and discounted using a certain social discount rate to determine the economic performance. Moreover, all the financial outflows and inflows have been calculated and discounted using a certain <b>financial</b> <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> to establish the cash flow streams. The economic and financial indicators obtained show that even toll roads socio-economically desirable are financially unfeasible. Hence, mixed financing schemes have been proposed including public incentives to attract private investors. A Build-Operate-Transfer (BOT) agreement between public and private parties is considered the more appropriate model to develop toll roads in Indonesia. It is essential to identify the risks related to the project; paying special attention to which party – the public or the private sector – will be mainly responsible for the planning and implementation of the mitigation measures and the management of such risks. Several financing schemes with different initial investment distributions, responsibilities, and risk allocations have been proposed. The conclusion drawn is that major initial investment covered by the private or public party implies greater financial profitability for the private party and smaller incurred cost for the public party respectively. However, it should be considered that more responsibility and financial risk will be assumed too. Based on the proposed schemes, the {{development of}} toll roads in Indonesia would be commercially viable under BOT financing schemes sharing the initial investment between public and private parties and establishing shadow tolls. An agreement regarding the portion of initial investment covered by each party and the shadow tolls compensation should be clearly defined in the PPP contract...|$|E

40|$|Temporal <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> {{are often}} poor {{predictors}} of behaviors {{that we expect}} will be motivated by the future. The current research suggests {{this may be because}} conventional discounting measures are poor measures of the motivational value of future rewards. In six studies, I develop motivation-based measures of the present value (PV) of future rewards and compare the PVs obtained with those obtained using conventional money-based discounting measures. Conventional money-based PVs consistently overestimate motivation-based PVs and are discriminable from them. I explore explanations for this mismatch, including timing of effort exertion (Study 2) and loss aversion (Study 3), both features of the motivation-based measures. In Study 5, I use self-reports of valuation strategies and a time pressure manipulation to demonstrate that participants use different valuation strategies in the conventional money-based and the motivation-based measures that, in part, determine the difference in PVs obtained and the relatively low correspondence between them.

The financial reform program commenced in 1989 when both the Reserve Bank Act and the Banking Act were revised with the easing of entry requirements into the banking system, and indirect monetary policy instruments were subsequently introduced in 1990. The adoption of a floating exchange rate in 1994 {{marked the end of}} major policy reforms in the Malawian financial sector. Using alternative definitions of spreads, our analysis shows that spreads increased significantly following liberalization, and panel regression results suggest that the observed high spreads can be attributed to high monopoly power, high reserve requirements, high central bank <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> and high inflation.

Using a largely unexploited dataset, the paper finds that corporate bond spreads are determined by firm-specific variables, bond characteristics, macroeconomic conditions, sovereign risk, and global factors. A variance decomposition analysis shows that firm-level characteristics account for the {{larger share of the}} variance. In addition, the paper finds two asymmetries. The first is in line with the sovereign ceiling "lite" hypothesis which states that the transfer of risk from the sovereign to the private sector is less than 1 to 1. The second is consistent with the popular notion that panics are common in emerging markets where investors are less informed and more prone to herding.

The purpose was to compare the absolute costs and the rate of decrease in costs, and to understand the reason for differences between the studies. The Australian-specific datasets are the ‘Australian Energy Generation Technology Costs’ report by the Electric Power Research Institute (EPRI), and the 2010 dataset used by the Australian Energy Market Operator (AEMO), largely based on the EPRI data with a review from ACIL Tasman. The assessment reviewed technical and economic parameters of wind, photovoltaic (PV) and concentrating solar thermal (CST) energy generation technologies, considering technology specific learning rates and cost reduction potentials. It includes a detailed exploration of the factors contributing to the learning rates and cost reductions. Levelised Cost of Energy (LCOE) calculations were used to develop cost outlooks and compare the outlooks to other projections. Where relevant, LCOE is calculated from capital and operating cost data at a common renewable resource level, exclusive of subsidies or carbon costs.

40|$|When new {{international}} statistical standards {{were published in}} 1993, {{one of the major}} changes to the recommended presentation of the system of national accounts and the balance of payments was the adoption of accruals reporting for income and expenditure. However, as countries have begun to implement these standards, questions have arisen about their exact interpretation in respect of interest flows associated with tradable debt, where the cash flow is fixed at the time of issue but where the price of the instrument fluctuates with market conditions. A clear consensus has yet to emerge. The paper explores the issues involved in using the alternative approaches, the so-called "debtor" and "creditor" approaches. The debtor approach uses the rate implicit at the time of issue, and the creditor approach, the current market rate. The paper concludes that the creditor approach is the only one consistent with accrual principles and market valuation for the debt outstanding. It reviews implications for national and sectoral saving from this approach.

Each bank forms a firm group endogenously and internalizes externalities directly within a firm group and indirectly across firm groups. This unique equilibrium requires a condition that separates competition for sources and uses of funds. I present a realistic institution that satisfies this condition.

The research aims to investigate Real Shocks in the <b>Discount</b> <b>Rate</b> of Pakistan, where by 66 years of historical data of the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in Pakistan is tested using the Augmented Ducky Fuller test in-order to determine the stationarity. The outcomes of {{the results of this study}} demonstrate that the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> of Pakistan is non-stationary in nature which confirms that there is a real shock in the <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> of Pakistan for 1948 - 2013.

40|$|Recent {{modelling}} of {{the costs}} and benefits of climate change has renewed debate surrounding assumptions regarding the social <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> in analysing the impacts of environmental change. Previous literature segments the social <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> into being influenced by two key factors; the rate of pure time preference and the elasticity of marginal utility of future consumption. These components of the social <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> reinforce the linkages between the choice of social <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> and intergenerational distribution. In an extension of previous work by the author on intergenerational distributional preferences, this paper discusses the relationship between intergenerational equity and the social <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> The work has significant policy implications given the sensitivity of Cost Benefit Analysis outcomes to assumptions regarding the social <b>discount</b> <b>rate.</b> Intergenerational equity, Social <b>discount</b> <b>rate,</b> Environmental Economics and Policy,...|$|R
40|$|We {{estimate}} individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> {{with respect}} to time streams of money using controlled laboratory experiments. These <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are elicited by means of field experiments involving real monetary rewards. The experiments were carried out across Denmark using {{a representative sample of}} 268 people between 19 and 75 years of age. Individual <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are estimated for various households differentiated by socio-demographic characteristics such as income and age. Our conclusions are that <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are constant over the 12 -month to 3 -year horizons used in these experiments, and that <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> vary substantially {{with respect to}} several socio-demographic variables. Hence we conclude that it would be reasonable to assume constant <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> for specific household types, but not the same rates across all households. <b>Discount</b> <b>Rates,</b> Time Preference, experimental economics censored dependent variable...|$|R
50|$|Discounting {{can either}} be {{prescriptive}} or descriptive. The descriptive approach is based on what <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> are observed in the behaviour of people making every day decisions (the private <b>discount</b> <b>rate)</b> (IPCC, 2007c:813). In the prescriptive approach, a <b>discount</b> <b>rate</b> is chosen based on what {{is thought to be}} {{in the best interests of}} future generations (the social <b>discount</b> <b>rate).</b>|$|R

A comparison of close-ended and open-ended time preference elicitation mechanisms showed that close-ended mechanisms elicit lower mean <b>discount</b> <b>rates,</b> although there is consistency between social and private <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> and between <b>discount</b> <b>rates</b> and individual traits (van der Pol and Cairns 2002).|$|R
