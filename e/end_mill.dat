40|$|AbstractA deduced {{cutting force}} {{prediction}} model for circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> process {{is presented in}} this paper. Traditional researches on cutting force model usually focus on linear milling process which does not meet other cutting conditions, especially for circular milling process. This paper presents an improved cutting force model for circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> process based on the typical linear milling force model. The curvature effects of tool path on chip thickness as well as entry and exit angles are analyzed, and the cutting force model of linear milling process is then corrected to fit circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> processes. Instantaneous cutting forces during circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> process are predicted according to the proposed model. The deduced cutting force model {{can be used for}} both linear and circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> processes.

40|$|Machining along {{continuous}} circular tool-path trajectories avoids tool stoppage {{and even}} feed rate variation. This helps particularly in high-speed milling {{by reducing the}} effect of the machine tool mechanical structure and cutting process dynamics. With the increase in popularity of this machining concept, the need for detailed study of a valid chip formation in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is becoming necessary for accurate kinematic and dynamic modeling of the cutting process. In this paper, chip formation during circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is studied with a major focus on feed per tooth and undeformed chip thickness along with their analytical derivations and numerical solutions. At first, the difference in the feed per tooth formulation for <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> along linear and circular tool-path trajectories is presented. In the next step, valid formulation of the undeformed chip thickness in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> is derived by considering an epitrochoidal tooth trajectory {{with a wide range of}} the tool-path radius. The complex transcendental equations encountered in the derivation are dealt with, by a case-based approach to obtain closed-form analytical solutions. The analytical solutions of undeformed chip thickness are validated with results of numerical simulations of tool and tooth trajectories for circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> and also compared to the linear <b>end</b> <b>milling.</b> The close resemblance between analytical and numerical calculations of the undeformed chip thickness in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> suggests validity of the proposed analytical formulations. As a case study, the cutting forces in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling</b> are calculated based on the derived chip thickness formulations and an existing mechanistic model. The calculation results reiterate the need of taking into account adjusted feed per tooth and valid chip thickness formulations in circular <b>end</b> <b>milling,</b> especially for small tool-path radii, for more realistic process modeling.
