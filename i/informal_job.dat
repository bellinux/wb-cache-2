The raw gender wage gap is higher in <b>informal</b> <b>jobs</b> (13 %) compared to formal jobs (5 %), but I show that this difference is an artefact of different male and female selection processes.

30|$|It is {{important}} to distinguish between formal and <b>informal</b> <b>jobs</b> because the <b>informal</b> sector {{plays an important role}} in developing economies like Indonesia. For the purpose of our study, the distinction between formal and <b>informal</b> <b>jobs</b> {{is important}} because jobs in the formal sector may require different skills than <b>jobs</b> in the <b>informal</b> sector. In general, the informal sector has been defined in three ways. The International Labour Organisation (ILO) and the Economic Commission for Latin American and the Caribbean define the informal sector as the sum of non-professional self-employed, domestic workers, unpaid workers, and workers in enterprises employing five or fewer workers (Angelini and Hirose, 2004). Second, formal employment can be defined as employment in a job where mandatory social security contributions are paid. Third, formal employment can be defined as employment in firms that are registered.|$|R

As will be explained later, in the current context, most of those who lose their informal jobs either exit the labor force or stay unemployed. We examine the transition in further detail later in the text.|$|E

This theoretical distribution clearly shows that the conventional dichotomization of formal vs. <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> searches captures {{only a small portion of}} job search behaviors.

40|$|Abstract- The Turkish labour market, {{like that}} of many {{developing}} economies, is characterised by widespread recourse to <b>informal</b> <b>jobs.</b> Sever-al measures have recently been taken by the Turkish authorities to limit the extent of this tendency. These are {{in keeping with the}} dynamic process of accession to the EU to which Turkey has been committed since the opening of negotiations in October 2005. From Household Labour Force surveys conducted by the Turkish Statistical Institute, the study presented here de-picts a panorama of informal employment in Turkey before the implementa-tion of these measures. It responds to the need expressed by the Council of the European Union to have an analysis of undeclared work. From a de-scriptive analysis of the main features of <b>informal</b> <b>jobs</b> and from the estima-tion of the probability of informal employment, it brings out a number of lessons on how to target policies to combat informal employment in Turkey and on the people who encounter the greatest difficulties in accessing or participating in the market...|$|R

30|$|This study {{highlights}} {{the necessity of}} distinguishing {{the use of the}} formal-informal joint channel from the sole reliance on either the formal or <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> search channel. I first used interview data collected in three Chinese cities as well as ethnographic case studies in the existing literature to illustrate a typology of the distribution of job search behavior, by focusing on the match between individual qualifications and employers’ hiring requirements. Based on data drawn from the 2003 China General Social Survey, the subsequent quantitative analysis confirms that neither the formal nor the <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> search channel dominates individual job search behaviors in practice. Rather, the formal-informal joint channel is used most frequently. Quantitative findings also show that competitive individual job seekers who possess both certifiable and non-certifiable qualifications are more likely to jointly use formal and <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> search methods. This study confirms that contact use plays a positive role in job searches, but very often in combination with the use of formal job search methods, rather than being used alone.|$|E

We empirically examine these issues specifically for rural migrants in urban China, a country where one of the largest domestic migration in human history has occurred over the past decades. We find that there exists a significant wage penalty for those migrant workers who have conducted their search through informal channels, despite their popularity. Our further analysis suggests two potential reasons for the wage penalty: 1) the <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> search sends a negative signal (of workers' inability to successfully find a job in a competitive market) to potential employers, resulting in lower wages; and 2) there exists a trade-off between wages and search efficiency for quicker entry into local labor market. We also find some evidence that the <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> search may lead to low-skilled jobs with lower wages. We do not find strong evidence supporting alternative explanations...|$|E

(2) Do social resources {{theory and the}} theory of employee referrals explain {{the conditions under which}} <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> searchers find good jobs? The questions are examined using a rather unique dataset which was collected among people who completed secondary vocational education in 1998. It is found that the use of informal methods in itself rarely promotes one’s chances of finding a good job. Rather, good jobs can be accessed through either high status contacts or employee referrals. These findings are consistent with both social resources theory and the theory of employee referrals...|$|E

30|$|We {{find that}} Syrian refugee inflows have {{negatively}} affected {{the likelihood of}} employment for natives, while their wage outcomes have not been affected in a statistically significant way. We focus on four mutually exclusive labor market outcomes {{defined in terms of}} their ratios to the population of native workers of age 15 – 64 : (i) not in labor force, (ii) formal employment, (iii) informal employment, and (iv) unemployment. We find that the informal employment-to-population ratio has declined by around 2.2 percentage points as a consequence of refugee inflows. Of this decline in informal employment, around 50 % went out of the labor force, 32 % remained unemployed, and 18 % switched to a formal job. For men, the decline in the informal employment-to-population ratio is 1.9 percentage points. Most of the men who lost their <b>informal</b> <b>jobs</b> remained unemployed. For women, however, the decline is much higher, 2.6 percentage points. Almost all of the women who lost their <b>informal</b> <b>jobs</b> went out of the labor force. These findings suggest that native workers who lost their <b>informal</b> <b>jobs</b> were substituted by informal Syrian refugees. Among these substituted natives, women have found it extremely difficult to find new jobs and, consequently, dropped out of the workforce. Men, on the other hand, have preferred to stay in the labor force, which has led to increased incidence of unemployment. To summarize, unemployment has increased, while labor force participation, <b>informal</b> employment, and <b>job</b> finding rates have declined for natives. The disadvantaged groups, i.e., women, younger workers, and less-educated workers, have been affected the worst. We find a small, but unexpected, increase in formal employment among men, which we conjecture that is due to the increased presence of organizations to supply health, education, nutrition, security, childcare, and other services to the Syrian refugees located in the region. We conclude that the prevalence of informal employment in the Turkish labor markets has amplified the negative impact of Syrian refugee inflows on natives’ labor market outcomes.|$|R
30|$|This section {{estimates}} the earnings gap between {{formal and informal}} employment, taking different variables into account, including ability and personal characteristics. Ceteris paribus, one assumes that, when given the choice, a person would prefer the job with higher earnings. Considering income {{as a proxy for}} individual utility and embedded in the principle of revealed preferences (Nguyen et al. 2013), an individual would not choose to be employed informally if the overall earnings are significantly lower in the informal sector. In other words, for salaried workers, a significant earnings gap between a formal and an <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> would lead them to prefer the formal job unless more benefits or better working conditions were associated with the <b>informal</b> <b>job.</b>|$|E
30|$|We {{formulate}} {{a model of}} an urban labour market in a developing economy in which workers’ risk attitudes {{play a role in}} determining their labour supply decisions and we illustrate the model diagrammatically. Whereas in the Rauch ([12]) model risk is excluded, with choices being made purely on the basis of ability, in our formulation trade-offs between ability and risk aversion matter. For example, when risk is excluded from the analysis a worker’s first preference might be self employment (maximizing expected income); but, incorporating risk into the model, given that self employment income is uncertain, the worker’s risk aversion may be sufficient to make him or her prefer formal wage employment. Similarly, the results of the search-and-matching literature on informality would be modified if risk aversion were taken into account. For example, in the model of Albrecht et al. ([1]) workers who are relatively productive in formal-sector employment reject <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> offers to wait for a formal-sector job. But if risk aversion were allowed for, these workers might not take the risk of rejecting the <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> offer. Parallel to our analysis, it is therefore possible that a worker with higher ability would take an <b>informal</b> <b>job,</b> while a worker with lower ability would get a formal job.|$|E

Immigrants with higher education, who obtained education in the Netherlands and/or who have no problems with the Dutch language rather search via advertisements and also find their jobs more often through this channel. Employment agencies are least often used by immigrants with tertiary education and, compared to <b>informal</b> <b>job</b> search methods, lead to a job most often for immigrants with secondary education, obtained in the Netherlands, and/or with good language proficiency. Finally, our results suggest that Turks search more often informally and also find a job more often via this channel than the Dutch whereas Surinamese and Dutch Antilleans search less informally than the Dutch and are most successful with employment agencies.
