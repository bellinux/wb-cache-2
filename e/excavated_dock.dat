50|$|When the Melbourne Harbour Trust {{was formed}} in 1877, Brady {{was one of the}} first {{applicants}} for the position of Chief Engineer. His previous success with railway and water projects appears to have impressed the commissioners, and so he won the position. While the Trust engaged Sir John Coode to provide advice and designs on the harbour improvements, Bradey was able to convince the scommissioners to accept his modification resulting in consuiderable efficiencies and cost savings. these involved using Australian hardwood timber piled wharfs instead of Coode's masonry, and excavating a single large basin for what became Victoria Dock rather than several small docks. As a result, Melbourne gained one of the largest single <b>excavated</b> <b>dock</b> basins in the World, which put the Harbour Trust in good stead for the next 80 years.|$|E

There is not {{room for}} all of them in the river; at least there is not room for them at the wharves, {{along the banks of the}} river, to load and reload. Accordingly, about fifty years ago, the merchants of London began to form {{companies}} for the purpose of <b>excavating</b> <b>docks</b> for them. The place that they chose for the docks was at a little distance from the river, below the city. Their plan was to build sheds and warehouses around the docks, so as to have conveniences for loading and unloading their ships close at hand.|$|R

50|$|In 2007, {{work began}} on a £20 million {{extension}} of the Leeds and Liverpool Canal, providing a further 1.4 mi of navigable waterway. A new 6.5 m-wide channel was <b>excavated</b> through Trafalgar <b>Dock</b> to {{the northern end of}} West Waterloo Dock as part of the canal route.|$|R
50|$|Mort's Dock was {{the brainchild}} of {{industrialist}} Thomas Sutcliffe Mort and former steamship captain T.S. Rountree (or Rowntree). Steam ships had first appeared in Sydney Harbour in 1853 but no repair or maintenance facilities existed to cater for the new vessels. In 1854, Mort and Rountree purchased an area of land at Waterview Bay on the northern side of the Balmain peninsula and <b>excavated</b> a dry <b>dock</b> measuring 123 by 15 m.|$|R
5000|$|When {{planning}} permission was granted on 15 April 1986, the whole site, including the lock, was derelict. Both the Coal Dock and the lock had been infilled with contaminated materials, {{which had to}} be excavated and disposed of. The design required the contractor {{to reduce the size of}} the Dock by 1/3rd from the north end, to form the 75-berth Marina; and to re-construct the lock chamber, lock-gates, and cill. Work on-site began in early May 1986, and within twelve months the contractor had <b>excavated</b> the <b>dock,</b> constructed a new north wall, re-puddled the dock floor and renovated the lock. The site was equipped with 14 tower cranes, and had approximately 1500 personnel on-site during most of the build phase. In April 1987 a [...] "commissioning Champagne Party" [...] was held on two pontoons in the newly flooded [...] "marina" [...] for all the staff directly involved.|$|R
60|$|Detached broken {{fossils of}} pre-adamite whales, {{fragments}} of their bones and skeletons, have within thirty years past, at various intervals, been {{found at the}} base of the Alps, in Lombardy, in France, in England, in Scotland, and in the States of Louisiana, Mississippi, and Alabama. Among the more curious of such remains is part of a skull, which in the year 1779 was disinterred in the Rue Dauphine in Paris, a short street opening almost directly upon the palace of the Tuileries; and bones disinterred in <b>excavating</b> the great <b>docks</b> of Antwerp, in Napoleon's time. Cuvier pronounced these fragments to have belonged to some utterly unknown Leviathanic species.|$|R
50|$|The dock {{entrance}} {{was on the}} River Hull {{just south}} of North Bridge, and the dock itself built west-south-west along {{the path of the}} North Wall as far as the Beverley Gate. The dock walls were of local brick, with Bramley Fall stone coping piece. Cement for the lock wall's front construction was rendered waterproof through the use of pozzolana imported from Italy. Piling for the walls consisted of piles narrowing from 12 by 9 in to 3 in at the bottom supporting sleepers 12 by 6 in wide by deep trenailed to the piles. The alluvium <b>excavated</b> during the <b>dock</b> construction was deposited mostly on land to the north, raising the ground by 5 ft—the land was later sold for building upon.|$|R
60|$|At a word {{of command}} from Montgomery, the four men in the launch sprang up, and with {{singularly}} awkward gestures struck the lugs. Montgomery steered us round and into a narrow little <b>dock</b> <b>excavated</b> in the beach. Then {{the man on the}} beach hastened towards us. This dock, as I call it, was really a mere ditch just long enough at this phase of the tide to take the longboat. I heard the bows ground in the sand, staved the dingey off the rudder of the big boat with my piggin, and freeing the painter, landed. The three muffled men, with the clumsiest movements, scrambled out upon the sand, and forthwith set to landing the cargo, assisted by the man on the beach. I was struck especially by the curious movements of the legs of the three swathed and bandaged boatmen,--not stiff they were, but distorted in some odd way, almost as if they were jointed in the wrong place. The dogs were still snarling, and strained at their chains after these men, as the white-haired man landed with them. The three big fellows spoke to one another in odd guttural tones, and the man who had waited for us on the beach began chattering to them excitedly--a foreign language, as I fancied--as they laid hands on some bales piled near the stern. Somewhere I had heard such a voice before, and I could not think where. The white-haired man stood, holding in a tumult of six dogs, and bawling orders over their din. Montgomery, having unshipped the rudder, landed likewise, and all set to work at unloading. I was too faint, what with my long fast and the sun beating down on my bare head, to offer any assistance.|$|R
