40|$|In this article, {{we examine}} the roles of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> and turning points in negotiation. Both concern impasses in negotiation, and negotiators can exploit them to move past impasses. Each term uses the word "point" differently, however. A <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> refers to a single salient {{coordinating}} concept shared by the parties. A turning point is a departure that takes place {{during the course of}} a negotiation, when the course seems to change. Precipitants precede turning points and consequences follow them. In this article, we focus on the relationship of these two negotiation concepts. We raise the following questions: Does the development of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> precipitate departures, and, if so, how? Do departures lead to the development of <b>focal</b> <b>points,</b> and, if so, how? Are there circumstances in which <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> do not precipitate turning points and vice versa? Do negotiations that feature <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> create more or less durable agreements? Do negotiations that include turning points create more or less durable agreements? To help answer these questions, we have analyzed four cases. In the German Foundation Agreement negotiation, the development of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> precipitated turning points. In the South African Interim Constitution negotiations, turning point departures precipitated the development of <b>focal</b> <b>points.</b> And in the negotiations to end the Burundi civil war and to reach the Nouméa Accord between France and New Caledonia, parties shared <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> that did not precipitate turning points. These case analyses provide insights into the role of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> in producing effective and durable agreements. They also suggest opportunities for further research on the interaction between these concepts. 24 page(s...|$|R

40|$|Existing {{experimental}} {{studies have shown}} that an outside option, when offered to one of the two players who later participate in a battle-of-the-sexes game, facilitates coordination by making the equilibrium that favors the same player focal. Since the other player’s payoff in the outside option was lower than that in the <b>focal</b> <b>point,</b> {{it is possible that the}}re was a reciprocal motive of the other player to coordinate on the <b>focal</b> <b>point.</b> Then it is possible that the actual power of the outside option to generate the <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> was either lower or non-existent. The current paper reports results of an experiment designed to test for the <b>focal</b> <b>point</b> effect of the outside option by controlling for the reciprocal motive of the other player.

40|$|This paper {{argues that}} the notion of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> is {{important}} in understanding bargaining processes. Recent literature confines a discussion of the usefulness of the notion to coordination problems and when bargaining experiments result in outcomes that are inconsistent with a straightforward interpretation of economic theory, some notion of ‘fairness’ is invoked. This paper uses symmetry requirements to formalize the notion of <b>focal</b> <b>points.</b> By doing so, it explains the focality of equal split division and it re-interprets recent experimental evidence in bargaining games. Experimental economists should try to empirically disentangle the importance of <b>focal</b> <b>points</b> from other explanatory factors (such as fairness). One way to do so, would be to study modal (instead of average) responses more systematically. Future theoretical research should focus on the strategic implications of proposing a frame (<b>focal</b> <b>point)</b> to conceive of the bargaining problem.
