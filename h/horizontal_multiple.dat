Using a large sample of European listed firms in the period from 2003 to 2011 and system GMM we find a significant compensation effect on corporate firm performance for the initial negative effect of <b>horizontal</b> <b>multiple</b> directorships by product market competition. In markets with effective competition, <b>horizontal</b> <b>multiple</b> directorships turn out to be an efficient mechanism to increase firm performance and thus assure competitive advantages.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss {{strategies}} concerning the implementation of an agent-based simulation of complex phenomena. The model we consider accounts for population decomposition and interaction in industrial districts. The approach we follow is twofold: on one hand, we implement progressively more complex models using different approaches (vertical multiple implementations); on the other hand, we replicate the agent-based simulation with different implementations using jESOF, JAS and plain C++ (<b>horizontal</b> <b>multiple</b> implementations). By using both different implementation approaches and a multiple implementation strategy, we highlight the benefits that arise when the same model is implemented on radically different simulation environments, comparing the advantages of multiple modeling implementations. Our findings provide some important suggestions in terms of model validation, showing how models of complex systems tend to be extremely sensitive to implementation details. Finally we point out how statistical techniques may be necessary when comparing different platform implementations of a single model.

The switches in the first bay have their <b>horizontal</b> <b>multiples,</b> or [...] "banjo wires", cut in half, effectively dividing each switch into a line switch and a line junctor switch. Each of the ten junctor switches have ten junctors on its ten verticals, and each of its ten levels was wired as a line link, {{to one of the}} ten line switches of the LLF. Thus, the line link frame terminates 100 Junctors. Each junctor has full availability to however many hundreds of lines there are, via the hundred line links. The number of lines, thus the line concentration ratio (LCR), was engineered for the expected occupancy.|$|R
40|$|Predator {{data and}} {{exploratory}} {{fishing in the}} Scotia Sea have revealed the presence of cephalopod stocks in the Antarctic Polar Frontal Zone (PFZ). This is a vast, remote region where large epipelagic cephalopods aggregate into highly mobile schools making them difficult to locate and sample. We used satellite tagged predators and shipboard acoustics for coarse and fine scale location of cephalopod concentrations, and sampled them with commercial and scientific nets to determine the relationship between cephalopod distribution and mesoscale oceanographic features at the PFZ. Satellite tags were attached to 9 grey-headed albatrosses Diomedea chrysostoma, breeding at Bird Island, South Georgia, to monitor foraging at sea in January-March 1994. A foraging area at the PFZ, north of South Georgia, was located, an acoustic survey undertaken and a fixed station established where acoustic targets were found. A net survey was carried out with a commercial pelagic trawl, a rectangular midwater trawl 25 m 2 (RMT 25), a <b>horizontal</b> <b>multiple</b> plankton sampler and a neuston net. Acoustic layers were targeted and the RMT 25 sampled 200 m layers to 1000 m in daylight and darkness. Cephalopods were simultaneously recovered from food samples fed to D. chrysostoma chicks at Bird Island. Two CTD transects, approximately normal to the major current flow, were undertaken across the PFZ and remote-sensed sea-surface temperature images from NOAA polar orbiting satellites were obtained aboard ship. The pelagic trawl sampled a cephalopod community that closely resembled that exploited by D. chrysostoma. The largest and most conspicuous species was the ommastrephid squid Martialia hyadesi {{which is the most}} important cephalopod prey species. Net-sampled M. hyadesi had been feeding on crustaceans and mesopelagic fish. The cephalopod community was sampled in a feature, interpreted as a warm core ring, in an area characterised by mesoscale features associated with the bathymetry of the northern end of the Northeast Georgia Rise and near a gap in the Falkland Ridge. The association of these mesoscale features with the bathymetry suggests that they may be predictable foraging locations for the cephalopods and their predators...|$|E
40|$|The {{concept of}} {{distributed}} leadership (DL) is relatively a new notion of school leadership {{which refers to}} multiple leaders in school, both formal and informal or designed, or by default. DL practice can be shaped through bottom-up and <b>horizontal</b> <b>multiple</b> interactions among a web of leaders at various levels. The {{purpose of the study}} is to explore the perceptions and practices of school leaders about the distributed leadership, while looking at roles, nature of role distribution and the nature of decision- making as distributed phenomena. This study can be sought an acknowledgement as {{the first of its kind}} in the context of Pakistan which would contribute to the improvement of schools by identifying how the leadership roles are distributed among multiple leaders in schools to achieve common goals. Furthermore, it will also contribute to the development of a healthy working relationship among all stakeholders of schools in general. This study may also open the avenues for future studies with reference to effective governance of schools in the developing world context like Pakistan. The central research question that guided the study was: How is distributed leadership idealized and practiced in a private secondary school in Karachi, Pakistan? This study has been conducted through the case study method, within the qualitative research paradigm. Data were collected through semi-structured interviews, document analysis and observations. Since the purpose of the study was to explore the phenomenon of distributed leadership through studying different roles; therefore, certain actors were the target of the study. The principal, three section heads and two subject coordinators were selected as research participants through purposive sampling. The findings of the study reveal that leadership roles are distributed among multiple stakeholders at FSSI. The leadership roles are distributed formally in collective and collaborative ways. Some leadership roles are informally distributed on the basis of skills, strengths and voluntary spirit of staff members in the school community. Decisions take place at different levels according to the nature of work and are based on consultation and discussion, but personal, time-based decisions were also made. Exploring the leadership talent and division of labour are two important reasons for role distribution among various stakeholders. 1 Five Star School, the pseudonym of the school...|$|E

50|$|Junctors are wired from LLF {{through the}} junctor {{grouping}} frame to {{the levels of}} trunk junctor switches in the trunk link frame (TLF). Unlike earlier designs, the junctors have no supervisory relays or other active hardware, all such functions being assigned to trunk circuits. The basic design of the TLF has ten junctor switches with their <b>horizontal</b> <b>multiples</b> split in half, hence two hundred junctors, and two hundred trunk links to the ten trunk switches. The banjo wiring of the trunk switch was not split, but a discriminator level trick devoted two levels to doubling {{the use of the}} other eight, thus allowing each trunk switch to connect sixteen trunks to its twenty trunk links. This results in the TLF having a 0.8:1 trunk concentration ratio (TCR). This degree of deconcentration eventually turned out to provide too few trunk appearances for the variety of trunk types needed. The final 1970s 5XB offices had type C trunk switches with twelve levels, using two for discrimination, leaving a TCR of unity.|$|R

To assist {{in the development of}} target identification algorithms, our efforts involve gathering background GPR data for the various site conditions and circumstances that often typify clandestine burials. For this study, forensic anthropologists established shallow-grave plots at The University of Tennessee Anthropological Research Facility (ARF) that are specific to GPR research. These plots contain donated human cadavers lying in various configurations and depths, surrounded by assorted construction material and backfill debris. We scanned the plots using two GPR technologies: (1) a multi-frequency synthetic-aperture FM-CW radar (200 - 700 MHz) (GPR-X) developed by the U. S. Department of Energy's (DOE) Special Technologies Laboratory (STL), Bechtel Nevada (Koppenjan et al., 2000), and (2) a commercial pulse radar (SIR- 20) manufactured by Geophysical Survey Systems, Inc.

40|$|AbstractThe {{generally}} accomplished {{technique for}} horizontal wells in tight gas reservoirs is by multi-stage hydraulic fracturing, not to mention, the flow {{characteristics of a}} <b>horizontal</b> well with <b>multiple</b> transverse fractures are very intricate. Conventional methods, well as an evaluation unit, are difficult to accurately predict production capacity of each fracture and productivity differences between wells with a different number of fractures. Thus, a single fracture sets the minimum evaluation unit, matrix, fractures, and lateral wellbore model that are then combined integrally to approximate <b>horizontal</b> well with <b>multiple</b> transverse hydraulic fractures in tight gas reservoirs. This paper presents a new semi-analytical methodology for predicting the production capacity of a <b>horizontal</b> well with <b>multiple</b> transverse hydraulic fractures in tight gas reservoirs. Firstly, a mathematical flow model used as a medium, which is disturbed by finite conductivity vertical fractures and rectangular shaped boundaries, is established and explained by the Fourier integral transform. Then {{the idea of a}} single stage fracture analysis is incorporated to establish linear flow model within a single fracture with a variable rate. The Fredholm integral numerical solution is applicable for the fracture conductivity function. Finally, the pipe flow model along the lateral wellbore is adapted to couple multi-stages fracture mathematical models, and the equation group of predicting productivity of a multi-stage fractured horizontal well. The whole flow process from the matrix to bottom-hole and production interference between adjacent fractures is also established. Meanwhile, the corresponding iterative algorithm of the equations is given. In this case analysis, the productions of each well and fracture are calculated under the different bottom-hole flowing pressure, and this method also contributes to obtaining the distribution of pressure drop and production for every horizontal segment and its changes with effective fracture half-length and conductivity. Application of this technology will provide gas reservoir engineers a better tool to predict well and fracture productivity, besides optimizing transverse hydraulic fractures configuration and conductivity along the lateral wellbore...|$|R
