The Glan-y-wern Canal was unused at the time, following Lord Vernon's <b>distraint,</b> but Tennant, who had no previous experience with canals, decided to lease it, enlarge it and extend it. He planned to make it suitable for barges of , which would gain access to the river Neath through a lock at Red Jacket. Where the canal turned northwards across Crymlyn Bog, he would extend it to the west, to terminate at a lock into the River Tawe, near Swansea harbour. He believed that Swansea docks would provide a better shipping point than Neath or Giant's Grave, and hoped that the canal would encourage the development of the corridor through which it ran. He attempted to gain support for the scheme from local landowners, but when none was forthcoming, he decided to fund the project himself. Lord Vernon's estate had been inherited by the Earl of Jersey in 1814, and so Tennant leased the Glan-y-wern Canal from him.|$|E

Jenkins obtained a lease to build it from Lord Vernon on 14 August 1788, but died on the same day. Edward Elton took over management of the colliery, and the canal was constructed by 1790, {{although there was no}} actual connection to the river. At Red Jacket, cargos were transhipped from the small boats used on the canal to larger vessels in the pill, which was tidal. The canal remained in use for about 20 years. Elton became bankrupt and died in 1810 after which Lord Vernon, who had leased the land on which the canal {{was built to}} Elton, placed a <b>distraint</b> on the wharves at Red Jacket and on the barges and it became disused.|$|E

[...] The key connotation of the word [...] "distraint" [...] is that there is often a taking of possession or withholding of property to induce a debtor to pay an obligation.

40|$|The project {{analyzes}} current {{legislation on}} usury in the Czech Republic {{and the financial}} literacy of the adult population. On 1 Dec. 2016, an amended Act on Consumer Loans entered into force and this project examines it. The project compares Czech legislation on usury with selected European Union countries.

The most effective legislation can be considered in Spain, which explicitly stipulates allowed interest rate limits. Based on that, Czech legislation on usury should be adjusted. The research results show a correlation between respondents' highest-achieved level of education and their financial literacy levels. The research also finds that the number of court <b>distraints</b> (property seizures) and the willingness to borrow money is lower among respondents with university-level education than for respondents with secondary and basic school education.

In the Czech Republic {{the number of people who}} find themselves in financial shortcoming due to over- indebtedness has recently raised. When we compare the Czech Republic with the advanced countries in the European Union, we find out the over-indebtedness is not so high. What is, however, alarming is its dynamics in the recent years. These figures are confirmed with statistic data. The phenomenon of consumer loans started to develop in the late 1990 's when the first negative consequences, i. e. social and psychological impact, and <b>distraints,</b> which had not been known so far, appeared for the first time. Mortgages are seen as relatively healthy form of debt because their reimbursement is not as problematic as it is with the consumer loans. Investment into living is considered as long-lasting. There are several possibilities how to cope with debts.

50|$|The levy of fines on rent arrear, and the <b>distraints</b> for debt due, {{which were}} {{obtained}} through the borough court, were {{a matter of}} interest to the burgesses of the court, and first taught the burgesses co-operative action.

The sheriff was in many cases also the constable of the castle, set by the Normans to overawe the English boroughs; his powers were great and dangerous enough to make him an officer specially obnoxious to the boroughs. Henry I about 1131 gave the London citizens the right to choose their own sheriffs and a justiciar answerable for keeping the pleas of the crown. In 1130 the Lincoln citizens paid to hold their city in chief of the king.

40|$|Financial {{literacy}} {{is a topic}} of the day which concerns all the categories {{of the population in}} their everyday life. The thesis titled Financial Literacy of Refuge Clients tries to describe the theme of financial literacy from two points of view. On one hand, from the viewpoint of people who, for various reasons, have become clients of refuge and on the other hand, from the viewpoint of social workers who work in refuge. The theoretical part is divided into four subchapters which describe a given issue. An explanation of the basic terminology related to the topic is followed by a subchapter on financial education of children and adults and activities in the field of education. The third subchapter deals with potential effects of financial literacy {{and the end of the}} theoretical part focuses on social work with refuge clients. The practical part describes a research which consists of two parts. To achieve the defined goal, a qualitative research has been employed in both parts, using the survey method and the semi-structured interview technique. The document contents analysis was used in the second part of the research. The survey research was carried out in five refuge of Diaconia of the Evangelical Church of the Czech Brethren. The first part of the survey involved fifteen communication partners, users of the refuge as a social service. The second part of the survey involved five communication partners, social workers in refuge. Both survey samples were created by a special-purpose selection. The data gathered in the interviews were evaluated by means of the open coding method. The main goal of the thesis was to find out how refuge clients view their own financial literacy and a potential for improvement in this respect. A sub-goal of the thesis focused on learning viewpoints of the social workers regarding the potential for improving financial literacy of the refuge clients. The survey results have shown that the category of financial literacy within the meaning as defined in literature is not represented in the refuge clients. With regard to their generally difficult situation which also includes their financial situation, the category of financial literacy narrowed to the efforts to make both ends meet at the end of the month and to the question whether or not to deal with financial claims, debts or <b>distraints.</b> This is the setting which has to be the basis for work of social workers in refuge as well. There exists a wide-ranging offer of potential paths leading to financial literacy for all categories of the population, regardless their address. Leaving aside education at school, getting further information is optional, conditioned by everybody's own interest. To increase financial literacy of the clients, social workers may choose from many options, or use their own knowledge and skills. The main prerequisite for success is to adapt themselves to the clients' interest and capabilities. The thesis describes attitudes of refuge clients to financial {{literacy is}}sues which are identical to the attitudes of this specific category of the population to addressing their difficult financial situation. Social workers become aware of additional possibilities of financial literacy improvement which they can use when working with their clients. Based on the survey results obtained, a comprehensible leaflet has been prepared, containing the essential information about financial literacy. The leaflet in both electronic and printed version will be available for those interested in it, i. e. refuge clients, social workers as well as the general public...|$|R

On ascertaining that a <b>distraint</b> was to be put on the ground which owed the rent, he attended there with a crowd of countrymen, and would not allow the bailiff to put his foot upon the lands; the next day the bailiff came again with police in numbers at his heels, and found the twenty acres which had yesterday been waving with green crops, utterly denuded. Every blade had been cut and carried in the night, and was then stacked on the ground on which no <b>distraint</b> could be levied. In twelve hours, and those mostly hours of darkness, twenty acres had been reaped, bound, carted, carried, uncarted, and stacked, and the bailiff and the policemen had nothing to seize but the long, green, uneven stubble.|$|E

6000|$|We {{must not}} judge a man's whole {{intellectual}} character, and declare {{him to be}} incapable of poetry, on the score of a few legal papers about matters of business. Apparently Shakspere helped that Elizabethan Mr. Micawber, his father, out of a pecuniary slough of despond, in which the ex-High Bailiff of the town was floundering,-- pursued by the <b>distraint</b> {{of one of the}} friendly family of Quiney-- Adrian Quiney.

Indeed, Shakspere's case is the less [...] "out of the way" [...] of the two. He wanted his loan to be repaid, and told his lawyer to bring an action. Bacon wanted to keep his head (of inestimable value) on his shoulders; or to keep his body out of the Tower; or he merely, as he declares, wanted to do his duty as a lawyer of the Crown. In any case, Bacon was in a tragic position almost unexampled; and was at once overwhelmed by work, and, one must suppose, by acute distress of mind, in the case of Essex. He must have felt this the more keenly, if, as some Baconians vow, HE WROTE THE SONNETS TO ESSEX. Whether he were writing his Hamlet when engaged in Essex's case (1601), or any other of his dramatic masterpieces, even this astonishing man must have been sorely bestead to combine so many branches of business.|$|E
6000|$|It {{was settled}} that Grace {{should go to}} Allington {{as soon as a}} letter could be {{received}} from Miss Dale in return to Grace's note, and on the third morning after her arrival at home she started. None but they who have themselves been poor gentry,--gentry so poor as not to know how to raise a shilling,--can understand the peculiar bitterness of the trials which such poverty produces. The poverty of the normal poor does not approach it; or, rather, the pangs arising from such poverty are altogether of a different sort. To be hungry and have no food, to be cold and have no fuel, to be threatened with <b>distraint</b> for one's few chairs and tables, and with the loss of the roof over one's head,--all these miseries, which, if they do not positively reach, are so frequently near to reaching the normal poor, are, no doubt, the severest of the trials to which humanity is subjected. They threaten life,--or, if not life, then liberty,--reducing the abject one to a choice between captivity and starvation. By hook or crook, the poor gentleman or poor lady,--let the one or the other be ever so poor,--does not often come to the last extremity of the workhouse. There are such cases, but they are exceptional. Mrs. Crawley, through all her sufferings, had never yet found her cupboard to be absolutely bare, or the bread-pan to be actually empty. But there are pangs to which, at the time, starvation itself would seem to be preferable. The angry eyes of unpaid tradesmen, savage with an anger which one knows to be justifiable; the taunt of the poor servant who wants her wages; the gradual relinquishment of habits which the soft nurture of earlier, kinder years had made second nature; the wan cheeks of the wife whose malady demands wine; the rags of the husband whose outward occupations demand decency; the neglected children, who are learning not to be the children of gentlefolk; and, worse than all, the alms and doles of half-generous friends, the waning pride, the pride that will not wane, the growing doubt whether it be not better to bow the head, and acknowledge to all the world that nothing of the pride of station is left,--that the hand is open to receive and ready to touch the cap, that the fall from the upper to the lower level has been accomplished,--these are the pangs of poverty which drive the Crawleys of the world to the frequent entertaining of that idea of the bare bodkin. It was settled that Grace should go to Allington;--but how about her clothes? And then, whence was to come the price of her journey? ...|$|E
60|$|And {{the fact}} was soon known to the American Minister and his family. Mr. Spalding {{was a man who}} at home had been very hostile to English interests. Many American gentlemen are known for such hostility. They make anti-English speeches about the country, as though they thought that war with England would produce certain triumph to the States, certain {{increase}} to American trade, and certain downfall to a tyranny which no Anglo-Saxon nation ought to endure. But such is hardly their real opinion. There, in the States, as also here in England, you shall from day to day hear men propounding, in very loud language, advanced theories of political action, the assertion of which is supposed to be necessary to the end which they have in view. Men whom we know to have been as mild as sucking doves in the political aspiration of their whole lives, suddenly jump up, and with infuriated gestures declare themselves the enemies of everything existing. When they have attained their little purpose,--or have failed to do so,--they revert naturally into their sucking-dove elements. It is so with Americans as frequently as with ourselves,--and there is no political subject on which it is considered more expedient to express pseudo-enthusiasm than on that of the sins of England. It is understood that we do not resent it. It is presumed that we regard it as the Irishman regarded his wife's cuffs. In the States a large party, which consists chiefly of those who have lately left English rule, and who are keen to prove to themselves how wise they have been in doing so, is pleased by this strong language against England; and, therefore, the strong language is spoken. But the speakers, who are, probably, men knowing something of the world, mean it not at all; they have no more idea of war with England than they have of war with all Europe; and their respect for England and for English opinion is unbounded. In their political tones of speech and modes of action they strive to be as English as possible. Mr. Spalding's aspirations were of this nature. He had uttered speeches against England which would make the hair stand on end on the head of an uninitiated English reader. He had told his countrymen that Englishmen hugged their chains, and would do so until American hammers had knocked those chains from off their wounded wrists and bleeding ankles. He had declared that, if certain American claims were not satisfied, there was nothing left for Americans to do but to cross the ferry with such a sheriff's officer as would be able to make <b>distraint</b> on the great English household. He had declared that the sheriff's officer would have very little trouble. He had spoken of Canada as an outlying American territory, not yet quite sufficiently redeemed from savage life to be received into the Union as a State. There is a multiplicity of subjects of this kind ready to the hand of the American orator. Mr. Spalding had been quite successful, and was now Minister at Florence; but, perhaps, one of the greatest pleasures coming to him from his prosperity was the enjoyment of the society of well-bred Englishmen, in the capital to which he had been sent. When, therefore, his wife and nieces pointed out to him {{the fact that it was}} manifestly his duty to call upon Mr. Glascock after what had passed between them on that night under the Campanile, he did not rebel for an instant against the order given to him. His mind never reverted for a moment to that opinion which had gained for him such a round of applause, when expressed on the platform of the Temperance Hall at Nubbly Creek, State of Illinois, to the effect that the English aristocrat, thorough-born and thorough-bred, who inherited acres and titles from his father, could never be fitting company for a thoughtful Christian American citizen. He at once had his hat brushed, and took up his best gloves and umbrella, and went off to Mr. Glascock's hotel. He was strictly enjoined by the ladies to fix a day on which Mr. Glascock would come and dine at the American embassy.|$|E
