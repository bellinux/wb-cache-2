[...] In August 2015, Tremonti reiterated that there were no plans for Creed {{for at least the next}} few years, but he didn't rule out the possibility. [...] In September 2015, Stapp appeared on the Dr. Oz Show and recounted his history with depression and drug use, and how they contributed to mental health scare in November. [...] When asked about a Creed reunion, Stapp replied: [...] "I can tell you what, <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> <b>hope</b> so.

50|$|Hoffmann {{was born}} to Dr. E. Franz Hoffmann, psychiatrist, and wife in 1887. Hoffmann {{graduated}} from Cornell University in 1908. He was married and divorced twice. His first marriage was to actress Janet Beecher in August, 1919. He had one son, Richard Jr., who was a decorated bombardier in World War II, but who died {{as a young man}} of alcoholism. His son was divorced in 1952 from Christine Dodge Cromwell and they had one son. Cromwell was an heiress to her grandfather, founder of Dodge motor company, and divorced by charging he was only interested in her money. A year later Hoffmann's son remarried to Judith Ann Dexter. Hoffmann was close friends with actor Charles Coburn. Hoffmann was ethnically Jewish, but was an atheist. When asked by a minister if he was an atheist Hoffmann replied, “I don’t believe in Him, but <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> <b>hope</b> He believes in me.” He died at age 80.|$|E

One of the first things I will do when I get home is to go and see Bryant and possibly meet some of my old friends.

I will enclose my correct address at the bottom of this letter. I wish you would pass on my best wishes to all the gang, and especially to the class of 36. I have recently been promoted. As for myself I am fine and have done considerably traveling since I entered the service. One of my most enjoyable trips was to Rome, where I had the opportunity and good fortune of seeing the Vatican and the Pope. I was wondering if you were still publishing the Bulletin which I used to receive once in a while when I was in Africa. If you are I would appreciate it, if you would put me on the distribution list. I enjoyed reading it very much and would like to get it again. The weather gets pretty miserable around here at times, but I guess we can take for a little while longer. <b>I</b> <b>sure</b> <b>hope</b> to get home one of these days and have now over 2 years on foreign soil.
