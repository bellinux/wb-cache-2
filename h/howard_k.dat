500|$|Most historians, {{such as one}} of Roosevelt's many biographers <b>Howard</b> <b>K.</b> Beale have {{summarized}} {{that the}} corollary was influenced by Roosevelt's personal beliefs {{as well as his}} connections to foreign bondholders. The U.S. public was very [...] "tense" [...] during the two-month blockade, and Roosevelt requested that Britain and Germany pull out their forces from the area. During the requests for the blockade’s end, Roosevelt stationed naval forces in Cuba, to ensure [...] "the respect of Monroe doctrine" [...] and the compliance of the parties in question. The doctrine was never ratified by the senate or brought up for a vote to the American public. Roosevelt's declaration was the first of many presidential decrees in the twentieth century that were never ratified.|$|E

500|$|According to Castel, [...] "historians [...] {{have tended}} to {{concentrate}} {{to the exclusion of}} practically everything else upon his role in that titanic event [...] ". Through the remainder of the 19th century, there were few historical evaluations of Johnson and his presidency. Memoirs from Northerners who had dealt with him, such as former vice president Henry Wilson and Maine Senator James G. Blaine, depicted him as an obstinate boor who tried to favor the South in Reconstruction, but who was frustrated by Congress. According to historian <b>Howard</b> <b>K.</b> Beale in his journal article about the historiography of Reconstruction, [...] "Men of the postwar decades were more concerned with justifying their own position than they were with painstaking search for truth. Thus [...] Hilary Herbert and his corroborators presented a Southern indictment of Northern policies, and Henry Wilson's history was a brief for the North." ...|$|E
500|$|In September 1942, Wilson {{became chief}} of staff of Major General George Kenney's Allied Air Forces, Southwest Pacific Area and Fifth Air Force. Kenney had {{specifically}} requested General Henry Arnold to send Wilson to replace his {{chief of staff}}, Air Vice Marshal William Bostock, an RAAF officer. Wilson had known Kenney for many years and was on a first name basis with him; but while serving as his chief of staff, Wilson always addressed Kenney respectfully as [...] "general". The loss of Brigadier General Kenneth N. Walker over Rabaul in January 1943 and then his successor, Brigadier General <b>Howard</b> <b>K.</b> Ramey on a reconnaissance mission in March did not dampen Wilson's desire to accompany a mission, and he tagged along as a passenger on a B-24 on a bombing raid on Rabaul. For his service in the Southwest Pacific, Wilson was awarded the Distinguished Service Medal.|$|E
500|$|In later years, Voorhis {{had more}} to say about the reasons for his defeat. In 1958, he alleged that voters had {{received}} anonymous phone calls saying that he was a communist, that newspapers had stated that he was a fellow traveler, and that when Nixon got angry, he would [...] "do anything". [...] In November 1962, after Nixon's defeat in the California gubernatorial race, Voorhis appeared on <b>Howard</b> <b>K.</b> Smith's [...] program on ABC in the episode entitled [...] "The Political Obituary of Richard M. Nixon" [...] and complained about the way Nixon had conducted himself in the 1946 race. [...] Voorhis's appearance was overshadowed by the controversial participation of Nixon adversary Alger Hiss. [...] In 1972, Voorhis authored a book, The Strange Case of Richard Milhous Nixon, in which he stated that Nixon was [...] "quite a ruthless opponent" [...] whose [...] "one cardinal and unbreakable rule of conduct" [...] was [...] "to win, whatever it takes to do it". [...] In 1981, three years before his death, Voorhis denied {{in an interview that he}} had been endorsed by the NCPAC.|$|E

500|$|As the {{shooting}} took place, ABC News was signing off from its electoral broadcast, while the CBS broadcast was already over. It {{was not until}} 21 minutes after the shots that CBS's coverage of {{the shooting}} would begin. [...] ABC's <b>Howard</b> <b>K.</b> Smith had signed off {{the air and the}} closing credits and advertisements were playing over a wide studio shot of the anchors and staff when a voice over alerted the audience several times to stay tuned for a special report. [...] More than four minutes passed before Smith came back on the air announcing [...] "a disturbing report that Senator Robert Kennedy had been shot". [...] During that four minutes of extended coverage, the studio camera broadcast the live panic and bewilderment in the ABC newsroom. The reporters who had been present to report on Kennedy's win in the primary ended up crowding into the kitchen where he had been shot and the immediate aftermath was captured only by audio recording and cameras that had no live transmission capability. ABC was able to show scant live footage from the kitchen after Kennedy had been transported but unlike CBS and NBC, all of ABC's coverage from the Ambassador was in black and white. CBS and NBC shot footage in the kitchen of the shooting's aftermath on color film, which could not be broadcast until it was developed two hours after the incident.|$|E

Entertainment photographer Larry Birkhead, steadfastly maintained that he was the baby's father and filed a lawsuit to establish paternity.
