25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the axiom {{of choice}} is {{equivalent}} to the ability to well-order every set.

25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{malnutrition}} is {{a strong}} risk factor for becoming unwell with TB, that TB is itself {{a risk factor for}} malnutrition, and that malnourished patients with TB (BMI less than 18.5) are at an increased risk of death even with appropriate antibiotic therapy. Knowledge about the association between malnutrition and TB is prevalent in some cultures, and may reduce diagnostic delay and improve adherence to treatment.|$|E
25|$|A {{recent report}} on the Sava river in Serbia {{suggests}} {{that many of the}} river silts contain about 100Bqkg1 of natural radioisotopes (226Ra, 232Th, and 238U). According to the United Nations the normal concentration of uranium in soil ranges between 300μgkg1 and 11.7mgkg1. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> some plants, called hyperaccumulators, are able to absorb and concentrate metals within their tissues; iodine was first isolated from seaweed in France, which suggests that seaweed is an iodine hyperaccumulator.|$|E

25|$|The {{origin of}} the Haridasa {{movement}} is not clearly known, with some legends indicating there were holy men and kings who espoused this form of devotion {{as early as the}} 9th century. However <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the great Vaishnava religious devotionalism called Dasa Kuta found its organizational base and started to produce large congregation of devotees in the Karnataka region, largely due to the Vedanta (philosophy) propounded in the 13th century by Madhvacharya of Udupi (1238 - 1317 CE).|$|E
25|$|We {{recall that}} for a (unital, associative) ring R, we denote by V(R) the (conical, commutative) monoid of {{isomorphism}} classes of finitely generated projective right R-modules, see here for more details. Recall that if R is von Neumann regular, then V(R) is a refinement monoid. Denote by Idc R the (∨,0)-semilattice of finitely generated two-sided ideals of R. We denote by L(R) the lattice of all principal right ideals of a von Neumann regular ring R. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> L(R) is a complemented modular lattice.|$|E

25|$|Nitrous oxide in {{biological}} {{systems can be}} formed by an enzymatic or non-enzymatic reduction of nitric oxide. In vitro {{studies have shown that}} endogenous nitrous oxide can be formed by the reaction between nitric oxide and thiol. Some authors have shown that this process of NO reduction to N2O takes place in hepatocytes, specifically in their cytoplasm and mitochondria, and suggested that the N2O can possibly be produced in mammalian cells. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> N2O is produced by some bacteria during process called denitrification.|$|E
25|$|Recent {{discoveries of}} dolmens {{on the island}} (dating to {{the second half of}} the third {{millennium}} BC) seems to offer new insights into the culture of primitive Sicily. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the Mediterranean region went through a quite intricate prehistory, so much so that it is difficult to piece together the muddle of different peoples who have followed each other. The impact of two influences is clear, however: the European one coming from the Northwest, and the Mediterranean influence of a clear eastern heritage.|$|E
25|$|Other {{research}} has found that people whose parents became centenarians have an increased number of naïve B cells. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the children of parents who have a long life are also likely to reach a healthy age, but it is not known why, although the inherited genes are probably important. A variation in the gene FOXO3A is known to {{have a positive effect on}} the life expectancy of humans, and is found much more often in people living to 100 and beyond - moreover, this appears to be true worldwide.|$|E

25|$|Pharmaceuticals used in {{veterinary}} medicine, or as additives {{to animal}} food, pose a different problem, {{since they are}} excreted into soil or possibly open surface waters. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> such excretions may affect terrestrial organisms directly, leading to extinction of exposed species (e.g. dung-beetles). Lipid-soluble pharma residues from veterinary use may bind strongly to soil particles, with little tendency to leak out to ground water or to local surface waters. More water-soluble residues may be washed out with rain or melting snow and reach both ground water and surface water streams.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{electromagnetic}} radiation carries a certain linear {{momentum in the}} direction of propagation. In addition, however, light carries a certain angular momentum if it is circularly polarized (or partially so). In comparison with lower frequencies such as microwaves, the amount of angular momentum in light, even of pure circular polarization, compared to the same wave's linear momentum (or radiation pressure) is very small and difficult to even measure. However it was utilized in an experiment to achieve speeds of up to 600 million revolutions per minute.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> {{eukaryotic}} genomes including primates {{and humans}} {{are complex and}} have large numbers of long repeated regions. Short reads from second generation sequencing must resort to approximative strategies in order to infer sequences over long ranges for assembly and genetic variant calling. Pair end reads have been leveraged by second generation sequencing to combat these limitations. However, exact fragment lengths of pair ends are often unknown and must also be approximated as well. By making long reads lengths possible, third generation sequencing technologies have clear advantages.|$|E

25|$|For maximum {{likelihood}} estimations, a model {{may have a}} number of nuisance parameters. For the asymptotic behaviour outlined to hold, the number of nuisance parameters should not increase with the number of observations (the sample size). A well-known example of this case is where observations occur as pairs, where the observations in each pair have a different (unknown) mean but otherwise the observations are independent and normally distributed with a common variance. Here for 2N observations, there are Nnbsp&+nbsp&1 parameters. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> the {{maximum likelihood}} estimate for the variance does not converge to the true value of the variance.|$|E
25|$|Throughout {{the history}} of the Soviet Union, there were at least 476 {{separate}} camp administrations. The Russian researcher Galina Ivanova stated that, to date, Russian historians have discovered and described 476 camps that existed at different times on the territory of the USSR. <b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> practically every one of them had several branches, many of which were quite large. In addition to the large numbers of camps, there were no less than 2,000 colonies. It would be virtually impossible to reflect the entire mass of Gulag facilities on a map that would also account for the various times of their existence.|$|E
25|$|<b>It</b> <b>is</b> <b>well</b> <b>known</b> <b>that</b> strict {{churches are}} strong and {{growing in the}} {{contemporary}} United States, whereas liberal ones are declining. For Iannaccone's religious experience is a jointly produced collective good. Thus members of a church face a collective action problem. Strict churches, which often impose costly and esoteric requirements on their members, are able {{to solve this problem}} by weeding out potential free riders, since only the very committed would join the church {{in the face of such}} requirements. Consistent with the notion that religious experience is a collective good, Iannaccone et al. show that churches that extract more resources from their members (in the form of time and money) tend to grow in membership.|$|E
