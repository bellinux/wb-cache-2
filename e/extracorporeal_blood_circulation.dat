To underscore the importance of studying the naive microcirculation, we implanted titanium dorsal skinfold chambers in hamsters and used intravital fluorescence microscopy to study venular leukocyte rolling in response to ischemia-reperfusion injury or <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>circulation.</b> The experiments were performed in chambers that fulfilled all well-established criteria for a physiological microcirculation as well as in chambers that showed various extents of leukocyte rolling due to trauma, hemorrhage, or inflammation. In ideal chambers with a physiological microcirculation ( 100 leukocytes/mm), we observed a paradoxical reduction of leukocyte rolling after ischemia-reperfusion injury or <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>circulation.</b> A similar effect was observed when we superfused leukotriene B 4 (LTB 4) onto the chamber tissue. The initial increase in leukocyte rolling in response to an LTB 4 challenge was reversed by a second superfusion 90 min later.

We aimed to study the development of gut barrier loss in patients undergoing major non-abdominal surgery. Methodology/Principal Findings: Twenty consecutive children undergoing spinal fusion surgery were included. This kind of surgery is characterized by long operation time, significant blood loss, prolonged systemic hypotension, without directly leading to compromise of the intestines by intestinal manipulation or use of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulation.</b> <b>Blood</b> was collected preoperatively, every two hours during surgery and 2, 4, 15 and 24 hours postoperatively. Gut mucosal barrier was assessed by plasma markers for enterocyte damage (I-FABP, I-BABP) and urinary presence of tight junction protein claudin- 3. Intestinal mucosal perfusion was measured by gastric tonometry (P rCO 2,P r-aCO 2 -gap). Plasma concentration of I-FABP, I-BABP and urinary expression of claudin- 3 increased rapidly and significantly after the onset of surgery in most children. Postoperatively, all markers decreased promptly towards baseline values together with normalisation of MAP. Plasma levels of I-FABP, I-BABP were significantly negatively correlated with MAP at K hour before blood sampling (20. 726 (p, 0. 001), 20. 483 (P, 0. 001), respectively).

40|$|A {{modified}} polyethersulphone graft membrane {{was loaded}} with antiproteases, {{with the aim of}} reducing the active protease blood concentration during hemodialysis in acute catabolic renal failure or cardiopulmonary bypass. As protease/antiprotease system, elastase and alpha 1 -antitrypsin were used. The concentration of active elastase in aqueous solutions decreased as function of contact time with the membrane, approaching saturation. A 40 % loss of elastase activity was obtained at pH 7. 4, which was not due to autolysis, which accounted for 5 % of the loss. The highest reduction was achieved at pH 9. 0 (25 % higher than at pH 7. 4). The saturation level of elastase decrease, calculated by means of the Einstein equation, was reached after more than 47 minutes. We speculate that a time reduction might be achieved either increasing the concentration of immobilized antiproteases, or increasing the rate of elastase movement across the membranes by hydraulic, osmotic, or temperature gradients.

30|$|Acute kidney {{insufficiency}} (AKI) [1] requiring renal {{replacement therapy}} (RRT) occurs in approximately 4 % of critically ill patients [2] and {{is associated with}} a mortality rate ranging between 38 % and 82 % [3]. Whereas vascular access is necessary for <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>circulation</b> during RRT, measures should be taken to preserve the vascular network, due to the higher risk of long-term chronic renal disease in these patients [4]. In critically ill patients, veno-venous access via dialysis catheters (DCs) rather than arteriovenous access is recommended [5]. Most information and recommendations on temporary DC insertion and management are based on data concerning the use of long-term DCs in patients with end-stage renal disease (ESRD) or that of central venous catheters (CVCs) {{in the intensive care unit}} (ICU). Whether such data may be extrapolated to DCs in critically ill patients is questionable, because critically ill patients differ widely from ESRD patients, DCs differ widely from CVCs with regard to manipulation and management, and RRT techniques differ widely between the dialysis unit and the ICU.|$|E

The current study {{examined the effects of}} variables on the immobilization of protamine to cyanogen bromide (CNBr) -activated cellulose hollow fibers. The degree of protamine immobilization was controlled by three independent parameters: the amount of CNBr used during the activation process, the duration of the coupling process, and the protamine concentration in the coupling solution. By the adjustment of these parameters, cellulose fibers containing desired amounts of immobilized protamine (ranging from 1 to 20 mg of immobilized protamine per gram of dry fibers) were readily prepared. Heparin adsorption to the protamine-bound cellulose fibers was also examined. The adsorption isotherm followed a Langmuir adsorption model. The amount of heparin adsorbed was dependent on both the heparin concentration in the substrate solution and the protamine loading on the fibers. The Langmuir adsorption constant K was estimated to be 0. 37 ± 0. 06 mL/mg, whereas the saturation capacity Q s of the protamine-bound fibers increased with increasing the protamine loading...|$|E

40|$|<b>Extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> <b>circulation</b> (ECC) for dialysis, {{cardiopulmonary}} bypass and extracorporeal membrane oxygenation (ECMO) induces {{the activation}} of different humoral and cellular cascade systems. Systemic anticoagulation with heparin inhibits activation of blood coagulation but increases risk of bleeding. Heparin bonded surfaces (HBS) of the biomaterials reduce the activation of coagulation, platelets, complement system and leukocytes {{according to the}} type of HBS leading to improved biocompatibility. In this study the biocompatibility of a covalently end-point-attached heparin coating was analyzed in different in-vitro and in-vivo-models considering coagulation and complement systems. Mechanism inhibiting the activation on HBS were examined. An in-vitro-model integrating a roller pump and an arterial blood filter was filled with human blood. After heparin coating of whole circuit as well as isolated coating of arterial filter blood coagulation was less activated, but only modifying all blood contacting surfaces reduced complement activation. To examine mechanism of reduced complement activation heparin coated and unmodified surfaces were simultaneously tested in an in-vitro-study with a closed tube-circuit ("Chandler-Loop") filled with human blood. Significantly increased binding of complement inhibitors C 1 Inhibitor and factor H on HBS lead to significantly reduced detection of activation specific complement proteins (iC 3 b and C 5 b- 9) demonstrating reduced complement activation. Analysis of alternative C 3 -convertase and soluble terminal complement complex in blood revealed decreased activation for HBS. In-vivo-experiments with adult sheep compared ECMO with HBS or with unmodified surfaces for 120 hrs. Experiments demonstrated non-leaching and constant function of HBS preventing activation of coagulation and complement systems.

40|$|SummaryThe {{primitive}} <b>blood</b> <b>circulation</b> requires intravascular plasma flow [1]. However, {{it remains}} unclear whether the onset of earliest <b>blood</b> <b>circulation</b> is dependent solely on establishment of a functional circulatory organ or whether it also requires active processes inherent in blood cells. In this study, we present novel mechanisms for the onset of <b>blood</b> <b>circulation</b> by monitoring fluorescently labeled blood precursors and blood vessels in zebrafish. The earliest <b>blood</b> <b>circulation</b> occurs synchronously. This synchrony is achieved by the retention of erythroid precursors on the lumen of the vasculature after their invasion from the subaortic region, and then by simultaneous release of these precursors into the flow. Morphological and biochemical analyses suggest that the onset of <b>blood</b> <b>circulation</b> accompanies disruption of blood cell-to-vessel adhesion and requires metalloprotease-dependent processes. ADAM 8, {{a member of the}} a disintegrin and metalloprotease (ADAM) family, mediates the onset of <b>blood</b> <b>circulation.</b> In ADAM 8 -depleted embryos, erythroid cells fail to detach from the vascular lumen and stagnate. Expression of a protease-defective ADAM 8 in erythroid cells causes dominant-negative effects on <b>blood</b> <b>circulation,</b> suggesting cell-autonomous roles of ADAM 8. Based on these findings, we propose that the first erythroid cells require both flow-dependent passive and proteolysis-dependent active processes to enter the circulation...|$|R

All patients had contraindication to systemic heparin anticoagulation. The dialysis technique consisted of an on-line hemodiafiltration with a citrate dialysate without calcium using a Fresenius 4008 S dialysis machine and Fresenius Polysulfone F 60 dialyzers. The infusion solution was procured directly from the dialysate and was infused into the arterial line. To avoid the risk of hypocalcemia, calcium gluconate was infused to the venous return line. The study {{was carried out in}} two stages. During the first stage, the citrate infusion rate was 80 mL/min and the calcium infusion rate was 9 mmol/h. At the second stage, the rates were 100 mL/min and 11 mmol/h, respectively. The primary endpoint of this study was the incidence of thrombosis in the <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>blood</b> circuit and/or the dialyzer. A total of 78 sessions were conducted.

Methods: Total replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch was performed in 12 patients with acute type A dissection with the tear in the descending thoracic aorta between March 1991 {{and the end of}} September 1995. The indications for total replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch were cardiac tamponade, acute aortic regurgitation, cerebral ischemia, and dilatation of the ascending aorta. The operation was performed with the aid of <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulation,</b> <b>blood</b> cardioplegia, selective cerebral perfusion, and open distal anastomosis. The surgical procedure used was total replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch with a graft provided with three limbs accompanied by resection of the intimal tear in the descending thoracic aorta. Results: Hospital death occurred in two patients (16. 7 %). In both, death was due to dissection/related complications of renal/mesenteric ischemia. The other 10 patients have had uneventful postoperative courses over a mean period of 24 months. Conclusions: Total replacement of the ascending aorta and aortic arch accompanied by resection of an intimal tear distal to the left subclavian artery seems to be justified in selected patients with acute type A dissection with the tear in the descending thoracic aorta.

40|$|RATIONALE Hemolysis {{occurs in}} {{conditions}} such as sickle cell disease and malaria but also during transfusion of stored <b>blood,</b> <b>extracorporeal</b> <b>circulation</b> and sepsis. Cell-free hemoglobin (Hb) depletes nitric oxide (NO) in the vasculature, causing vasoconstriction and eventually cardiovascular complications. We hypothesize that Hb-binding proteins may preserve vascular NO signaling during hemolysis. OBJECTIVES Characterization of an archetypical function by which Hb scavenger proteins could preserve NO signaling during hemolysis. METHODS We investigated NO reactions kinetics, effects on arterial NO signaling and tissue distribution of cell-free Hb and its scavenger protein complexes. MEASUREMENTS AND MAIN RESULTS Extravascular translocation of cell-free Hb into interstitial spaces, including the vascular smooth muscle cell layer of rat and pig coronary arteries, promotes vascular NO resistance. This critical disease process is blocked by haptoglobin. Haptoglobin does not change NO dioxygenation rates of Hb; rather, the large size of the Hb:haptoglobin complex prevents Hb extravasation, which uncouples NO/Hb interaction and vasoconstriction. Size-selective compartmentalization of Hb functions {{as a substitute for}} RBCs following hemolysis and preserves NO signaling in the vasculature. We found that evolutionarily and structurally unrelated Hb binding proteins, such as PIT 54 found in avian species, functionally converged with haptoglobin to protect NO signaling by sequestering cell-free Hb in large protein complexes. CONCLUSIONS Sequential compartmentalization of Hb by erythrocytes and scavenger protein complexes is an archetypical mechanism, which may have supported co-evolution of hemolysis and normal vascular function. Therapeutic supplementation of Hb scavengers may restore vascular NO signaling and attenuate disease complications in patients with hemolysis...|$|R
