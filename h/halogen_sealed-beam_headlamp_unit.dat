2500|$|... 1992: All {{three models}} of the Storm {{received}} a new headlight cluster (with narrow <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>headlamps</b> also seen in that year's Pontiac Grand Prix GTP), tail lights, and front clip. Base models received a new rear bumper treatment. Instrument panel and gauge graphics were also slightly revised. The GSi version received a new spoiler and a larger DOHC engine which offered 10 extrahp.|$|R
5000|$|The Tempo was Ford's first compact car downsizing, {{just seven}} years after GM {{downsized}} its cars in 1976 for the 1977 model year (some of them in 1978 or later). The front windshield and rear window were both set at 60° angles, with {{the trunk of the}} car being placed higher than the side windows to allow for greater fuel efficiency and air flow. On the Tempo, a rear quarter window was present while the Topaz received a more formal C-pillar arrangement minus the window. The front of the car featured a set of two <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>headlamps</b> recessed in chrome [...] "buckets" [...] and the grille in between the headlights featured four horizontally thin rails each swept back to allow for greater air flow into the engine compartment and over the hood. The Tempo shared much of its design language with the European Ford Sierra, launched a year earlier.|$|R

5000|$|In 1986, the Tempo and the Topaz saw {{numerous}} moderate {{design changes}} which {{coincided with the}} release of the then-new and revolutionary 1986 Taurus. While generally considered the same car, the front and rear end styling was where the changes were most evident. The standard rectangular <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>halogen</b> <b>headlamps</b> were replaced with new, plastic composite designs which only required replacing the bulb itself. These new headlights were flush-mounted to match the redesigned front corner lights and a freshly restyled grille, which also closely matched that of the Taurus (the Topaz received a pseudo-lightbar grille styled after the Sable). For the rear end, the trunk and taillights were slightly restyled, giving the car a sharper look. Replacing the carburetor on the 2.3 L four-cylinder engine was a new Central Fuel Injection (CFI) system (the carbureted version was still available in Canada until 1987). New was an optional [...] "LX" [...] luxury trim, replacing the GLX. Other changes and improvements included the addition of automatically retracting front seat belt shoulder straps, and the addition of a new all-wheel-drive model. The Tempo AWD included special badging, interior badges. Other available features included power lumbar support, four-way power driver's seat and a cassette player.|$|R
5000|$|... 1989, the Shadow/Sundance {{received}} a facelift, with the <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> discarded {{in favor of}} more aerodynamic composite units. All-new grilles and tail lights were among the changes as well.|$|R
25|$|A {{light source}} (filament or arc) is placed {{at or near}} the focus of a reflector, which may be {{parabolic}} or of non-parabolic complex shape. Fresnel and prism optics moulded into the headlamp lens refract (shift) parts of the light laterally and vertically to provide the required light distribution pattern. Most <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> have lens optics.|$|R
50|$|Automakers {{faced an}} {{inherent}} conflict between NHTSA's stringent headlight legislation, which froze U.S. headlight technology in 1940, and the Corporate Average Fuel Economy standard, which effectively mandated that automakers develop {{ways to improve}} the ability of the car to cleave the air. As a result, in the early 1980s, automakers lobbied for a modification of the mandate for fixed shape <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The basic {{architecture}} of the Silver Cloud II did not change between 1959 and 1963, but there were numerous minor changes implemented, notable among them a succession of improvements to the ventilation system. [...] Interior changes in 1961 included the adoption of blue instrument lighting, {{the introduction of a}} combined indicator / headlamp flasher switch and of a handbrake warning light. A remodelled rear light assembly was introduced in May 1962 and a change to single <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> was made in August 1962.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s most serving SAR {{steam and}} {{electric}} locomotives had their original large round headlamps replaced by less attractive but more efficient double <b>sealed-beam</b> automobile <b>headlamps.</b> On Series 3, 4 and early series 5 units, the original round headlamp housing was retained {{and the glass}} {{was replaced by a}} metal disk containing the sealed beam headlamps. On Series 5 units with squared corners, the smaller round headlamp was replaced by <b>sealed-beam</b> automobile <b>headlamps</b> on the original or a similar rectangular backing plate above the end door.|$|R
25|$|Southern Pacific road {{switcher}} diesels often had elaborate lighting clusters front and rear, {{with a large}} red Mars Light for emergency signaling, and often two pairs of <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> {{one on top of}} the cab and the other below the Mars Light on the nose. Starting in the 1970s SP had cab air conditioning on all new locomotives and the unit is visible on the cab roof. Southern Pacific placed large snowplows on the pilots of their {{road switcher}}s for the heavy snowfall on Donner Pass. Many Southern Pacific road switchers had a Nathan-AirChime model P3 or P5 air horn with chords distinct to Southern Pacific locomotives in the western states.|$|R
50|$|The Simca 1100 {{was also}} the first small car, that was {{designed}} from the outset, with an angled single piece hatchback tailgate to enter large scale production. The earlier Renault 4 tailgate was near vertical like an estate car, and the Austin A40 originally had a split tailgate. The Simca was successful in France, but less so elsewhere due to 'tappety' engines and body corrosion. A total of 2.2 million cars were produced by 1985. In 1972 Renault introduced the monocoque Renault 5 supermini hatchback, that used the proven and successful Renault 4 mechanicals and suspension. It was made until 1985, when it was replaced by the 'Super Cinq'. American Motors (AMC) marketed a version with <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>headlamps</b> and reinforced bumpers as the 'Le Car' in the U.S. from 1976 to 1983.|$|R
50|$|In the 1970s most serving SAR {{steam and}} {{electric}} locomotives had their original large round headlamps replaced by less attractive but more efficient double <b>sealed-beam</b> automobile <b>headlamps.</b> On Series 3, 4 and 5 units, the original round headlamp housing was retained {{and the glass}} {{was replaced by a}} metal disk containing the sealed beam headlamps.|$|R
50|$|While the {{standard}} S-10 {{moved to a}} redesigned front fascia in 1998, the S-10 Electric kept the same front fascia as the '94-'97, {{with the exception of}} composite headlamps in 1998 versus the previous year's <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>headlamps.</b> The interior was also updated in 1998 along with internal combustion models, adding a passenger side airbag. Aside from this header panel, a unique lower bumper valance, and a stylized 'Electric' decal {{on the bottom of the}} doors, there is little difference externally between the appearance of an Electric and a stock S-10. Any changes, however minimal, were reported to have had a positive influence on reducing the truck's aerodynamic resistance. These changes included a closed grille and a front air skirt, belly pans beneath the front suspension, a seal between the cab and the pickup bed, and a half-length tonneau cover over the rear of the pickup bed.|$|R
5000|$|The Fiesta was {{initially}} available in Europe with the Valencia [...] I4 (high compression and low compression options), and [...] engines and in Base, Popular, L, GL (1978 onward), Ghia and S trim, {{as well as}} a van. The US Mark I Fiesta was built in Cologne, West Germany, but to slightly different specifications; US models were Base, Decor, Sport, and Ghia, the Ghia having the highest level of trim. These trim levels changed very little in the Fiesta's three-year run in the US, from 1978 to 1980. All US models featured the more powerful [...] engine, (which was the older [...] "Crossflow" [...] version of the Kent, rather than the Valencia) fitted with a catalytic converter and air pump to satisfy strict Californian emission regulations), energy-absorbing bumpers, side-marker lamps, round <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> improved crash dynamics and fuel system integrity as well as optional air conditioning (a/c was not available in Europe). In the US market, the Ford Escort replaced both the Fiesta and the compact Pinto in 1981, competing with the Chevrolet Chevette.|$|R
5000|$|The Modus {{was offered}} with a {{cornering}} lamp function. Concealed {{in the main}} <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit</b> and operating at speeds less than 38 mi/h km/h, the lights gave the driver a wider field of vision when going round bends. On Privilège and Initiale models, Renault offered the Modus with [...] "double-distance" [...] Xenon headlamps.|$|R
50|$|The F103 {{bodyshell}} was {{a development}} of the earlier DKW F102. The engine compartment had to be extended so that the new four-cylinder engine could be accommodated. The front and tail were also cosmetically revised: Audi F103s sold in Europe all featured quasi-rectangular headlamps which were becoming fashionable at the time, whereas the F102 had used round <b>headlamp</b> <b>units.</b>|$|R
50|$|During {{the first}} few months of 2004, MG Rover facelifted the design of the ZT and ZT-T to a less retro look, at the same time as the Rover 75 {{received}} a facelift. While the facelift didn't feature any mechanical differences, the changes were merely aesthetic and the main changes to the facelift, included the replacement of the twin headlamps, with a new, clear single <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit.</b>|$|R
5000|$|From 1970 to 1978, the Capri {{was sold}} in North America through Ford's Lincoln-Mercury Division. All were German-produced. Headlamps were four round sealed-beams (shared with the Capri RS3000), and turn signal lamps were grille-mounted on all US-spec 1971-74 Capris and 1976-78 Capri IIs. Full {{instrumentation}} wasn't available on 1971-72 four-cylinder models but was made standard equipment from 1973 on. An optional interior decor package, changed by name to the [...] "Ghia" [...] package for the Capri II, featured deluxe interior trim and features. 1973 Ford Capris were the Mk I face-lift models featuring the new grille, larger taillights and new interior and dash. The 1973 model had the federally mandated 2.5 mph front bumper for '73. The bumper was extended, the gap closed with a silver filler panel. 1974 models had larger bumpers front and rear with wraparound urethane, body-color bumper covers to meet the revised Federal front and rear 5 mph standard. 1976-78 models were the re-designed hatchback models offered worldwide since 1974, fitted with the grille-mounted turn signal lamps and the required round <b>sealed-beam</b> <b>headlamps,</b> 5 mph body-color bumpers and catalytic converter, requiring no-lead fuel. In 1976, an 'S' (JPS) special edition featured black or white paint with gold-coloured wheels, gold pin-striping, and upgraded two-tone interior in beige and black. Due to late production of Capri IIs, there were no 1975 models sold in the USA.|$|R
5000|$|Lamborghini {{launched}} a facelifted Diablo in 1999, simplifying the model range {{by eliminating the}} [...] "base" [...] Diablo (since the SV model had become the new entry-level trim anyway) and applying universal revisions across the lineup. The most immediately noticeable exterior change was {{the replacement of the}} previous Diablo's pop-up <b>headlamp</b> <b>units</b> with fixed composite lenses, borrowed under license from their original application in the Nissan 300ZX Z32. All Diablos were also fitted with new 18 inch wheels.|$|R
40|$|Development of TarVIP 1. 0, a {{computer}} model for predicting the detection distances of normal and UV activated pavement markings was recently completed at the Operator Performance Laboratory (OPL). Two Sherwin-Williams UV activated pavement marking samples, four UV <b>headlamp</b> <b>units</b> (Ultralux, Visteon, Cibio and Labino brands), and the UV filter covering the Labino UV <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit</b> were characterized {{in terms of their}} fluorescence coefficients, spectral emissions, and spectral transmissivity, respectively. The TarVIP model properly accounts for a complete three-dimensional representation of the roadway-headlamp-driver geometry. Veiling luminance due to fog is modeled using the Mie Scattering theory. The model consists of physical and human performance subsystems. Besides the aforementioned physical subsystem items, the human performance subsystem uses an extensive human visibility contrast threshold database to represent the human capabilities and limitations of pavement marking detection. The model was used to obtain the visibility distances under various levels of fog density, UV activated pavement marking and UV headlamp efficiencies. The resulting visibility distances show some potential benefits and some inadequacies of the UV headlamps and UV activated pavement markings. The computer model TarVIP was developed to obtain INTRODUCTION estimates of nighttime detection distances for conventiona...|$|R
50|$|Perhaps {{the most}} {{widespread}} use of Fresnel lenses, for a time, occurred in automobile headlamps, where they can shape the roughly parallel beam from the parabolic reflector to meet requirements for dipped and main-beam patterns, often both in the same <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit</b> (such as the European H4 design). For reasons of cost, weight, and impact resistance, newer cars have dispensed with glass Fresnel lenses, using multifaceted reflectors with plain polycarbonate lenses. However, Fresnel lenses continue in wide use in automobile tail, marker, and backup lights.|$|R
50|$|The {{original}} NSX body design {{received only}} minor modifications from Honda {{in the new}} millennium when in December 2001 the original pop-up headlamps were replaced with fixed xenon HID <b>headlamp</b> <b>units,</b> along with slightly wider rear tires to complement a revised suspension. Front spring rates were increased from 3.2 kg/m to 3.5 kg/m, rear spring rates were increased from 3.8 kg/m to 4.0 kg/m and the diameter of the rear stabilizer bar increased from 17.5 mm to 19.1 mm with a 2.3 mm wall thickness.|$|R
5000|$|The 306 {{underwent}} {{the only}} major revamp of its life in May 1997, with {{the launch of the}} [...] "Phase 2" [...] version (N5 in Australia). The basic shape remained the same, but lights, grille and bumpers were redesigned in an effort to bring the styling into line with the new, more rounded, Peugeot family look established with the Peugeot 406. Indicator lamps were now incorporated into the <b>headlamp</b> <b>unit</b> and the new style [...] "block filled" [...] Peugeot lion logo was adopted. The Phase 2 also saw the addition of an estate version.|$|R

Many Southern Pacific road switchers had a Nathan-AirChime model P3 or P5 air horn with chords distinct to Southern Pacific locomotives in the western states.The Southern Pacific and Cotton Belt were the only buyers of the EMD SD45T-2 [...] "Tunnel Motor" [...] locomotive. This locomotive was necessary because the standard configuration EMD SD45 could not get a sufficient amount of cool air into the diesel locomotive's radiator while working Southern Pacific's through snow sheds and tunnels in the Cascades and Donner Pass. These [...] "Tunnel Motors" [...] were EMD SD45-2's with radiator air intakes at the locomotive car body's walkway level, rather than EMD's typical setup with fans on the locomotive's long hood roof pulling air through radiators at the top/side of the locomotive's body. Inside tunnels and snow sheds hot exhaust from lead units would accumulate near the top of the tunnel or snow shed and be drawn into the radiators of trailing EMD (non-tunnel motor) locomotives, leading these locomotives to shut down as their diesel prime mover overheated. The Southern Pacific also operated EMD SD40T-2s, as did the Denver and Rio Grande Western Railroad.|$|R
50|$|In the United States, Federal {{lighting}} regulations required headlamps of {{sealed beam}} construction and standard {{size and shape}} on all vehicles, so Accords in North America were equipped with four rectangular <b>headlamp</b> <b>units</b> rather than the aerodynamic composite replaceable-bulb units used on Accords sold outside North America (note European specification imagery). Other Automotive lighting variations included amber front and red rear side marker lights and reflectors in North America, and headlamp washers and a red rear fog lamp for European markets. Japanese-market Accords were unique from all other markets in that they included adjustable ride height control and side view mirrors installed on the mid-forward fenders.|$|R
50|$|The Class 6E was {{delivered}} in the new body shape with squared corners that had been introduced part-way {{through the construction of}} the Class 5E1, Series 5 and was equipped with double <b>sealed-beam</b> automobile <b>headlamps.</b> The body dimensions were {{the same as that of}} the later models of the Class 5E1, Series 5 and the most visually obvious external difference was the replacement of the three small vertically arranged grilles to the right of centre on each side of the Classes 5E and 5E1 with a larger double grille on each side of the Class 6E. In respect of the coachwork, the Class 6E was identical to its immediate predecessor, the Class 6E1, Series 1, while its bogies were identical to those of the Class 5E1.|$|R

5000|$|For the 2007 {{model year}} Lotus several minor changes were made. The LOTUS decals {{on the rear}} of the vehicle, {{previously}} flat stickers, were replaced by raised lettering. The <b>headlamp</b> <b>units</b> were sealed. Also, in order to comply with US Federally mandated bumper restrictions, the frontal crash structure was slightly changed and rear bumperettes were added next to the licence plate mount. Approximately 100 2007 model year [...] "launch" [...] cars were shipped to the US without these bumper changes. Also in 2007, the Elise S was released and the 111R renamed Elise R. All Lotus Elise cars manufactured after 1 January 2007 include the new headlights and 2.5 mi/h km/h bumpers, although they are hidden in the front.|$|R
5000|$|The Class 6E1, Series 1 was {{delivered}} in the new body shape with squared corners that had been introduced part-way {{through the construction of}} the Class 5E1, Series 5, and was equipped with double <b>sealed-beam</b> automobile <b>headlamps.</b> The body dimensions were {{the same as that of}} the Class 5E1, Series 5 and the most visually obvious external difference was the replacement of the three small vertically arranged grilles to the right of centre on each side of the Classes 5E and 5E1 with a larger double grille on each side of the Class 6E1. Since the traction struts on the new Class 6E1 bogie allowed room for only one footstep instead of the earlier three to be mounted on the bogie, a stirrup step was added, attached to the bodywork directly below the side door.|$|R
5000|$|In 1973, Vauxhall {{acknowledged}} that their rather dull model range needed a makeover, {{and developed a}} radical version of the Firenza, known officially as the High Performance (HP) Firenza, but known colloquially as the [...] "droopsnoot" [...] after its dramatically styled aerodynamic nose. The nose was moulded from GRP, and featured two pairs of Cibié headlamps behind toughened glass covers. The overall look was somewhat reminiscent of the Renault Alpine A310, and used the same <b>headlamp</b> <b>units.</b> Several prototypes of the HP Firenza were considered with different types of front end treatment, requiring different degrees of change from the standard production front end, including cars known as Black Knight and Daytona, the latter for its resemblance to the Ferrari Daytona, a favourite of Wayne Cherry.|$|R
5000|$|A more {{powerful}} model, the 8 Major (model R1132), {{was released in}} 1964, featuring an 1108 cc engine developing [...] A still {{more powerful}} version, the 8 model R1134 Gordini, was also released that year, with a tuned engine of the same capacity but developing [...] The extra power was obtained by a cross-flow head and twin dual-choke 40mm side-draft Solex carburetors. A four-speed close ratio manual transmission, dual rear shock absorbers and uprated springs were fitted. The R1134 Gordini was originally available only in blue, with two stick-on white stripes. It was also distinguishable from the 8 Major by the bigger 200mm <b>headlamp</b> <b>units.</b> In 1965, the Renault 10 Major, a more luxurious version of the 8 with different front and rear styling, was released, replacing the 8 Major.|$|R
5000|$|In 1991, {{the front}} of the Dakota {{received}} a new grille and hood which extended the engine compartment to better fit the optional [...] 5.2 L V8, which was inspired by the earlier Shelby Dakota V8 option. By 1992, the standard square <b>sealed-beam</b> glass <b>headlamps</b> were phased out for the aerodynamic-style molded plastic headlamps attached to the grill components. It was equipped with halogen lights, making 1991 the only year for a unique front-end for the Dakota, though it is mechanically possible to fit sealed beams on 1992 to 1996 model years, as this model year was an overlap between new grille introduction and new headlamp introduction. Also debuting in 1991 were six-bolt wheels (replacing the earlier five-bolt wheels) based on Dodge's marketing attempting to differentiate the Dakota from competing manufacturers' trucks and the upcoming introduction of the redesigned Ram, and 1991 was also the first year for an optional driver-side airbag (made standard in 1994) and the last year for the Dakota convertible.|$|R
5000|$|In October 1993 the Honda Street's front {{design was}} changed yet again, {{receiving}} larger, more square <b>headlamp</b> <b>units.</b> A PGM-FI version in [...] "Fox" [...] and [...] "Xi" [...] equipment levels was also {{introduced to the}} Street at this time. This version produces [...] The front end changes were applied to the Acty as well, beginning in January 1994. The Acty and the Street were further modified in January 1996 when the turn signals were changed from amber to clear. At this time, the fuel injected Acty SDX-Hi was also introduced - only with two-wheel drive and a five-speed manual - with the same engine as the Street Xi (the Fox was dropped, replaced by the carburetted Street V). Production of the Acty continued until {{the arrival of the}} third generation in 1999, although the Honda Street continued to be built until 2001 as it was only partially replaced by the pricier Honda Vamos.|$|R
5000|$|The Austin 3-Litre is a British {{saloon car}} that was {{introduced}} by Austin at the London Motor Show in 1967. It became apparent that BMC were not geared up to producing the car: few or none {{seem to have been}} sold that year, but by July 1968 it was reported that the cars had begun to leave the factory. By that time the square headlights seen at the 1967 motor show had been replaced by conventional round twin <b>headlamp</b> <b>units,</b> and {{by the time of the}} October 1968 show the car had also acquired front quarter lights. [...] In July 1968, with cars beginning to emerge from the plant, the manufacturers were asked to detail improvements reportedly implemented since the car's [...] "launch" [...] the previous October. Mention was made of orifice modifications to hydraulic valves in the rear suspension, and it was stated that there was a [...] "new" [...] final drive ratio of 3.9:1, though this was actually the same final drive ratio included in the launch information the previous October.|$|R
50|$|The {{rebodied}} R20/R30 {{was introduced}} in January 1992 and produced until September 1996. For this series, the mechanicals were largely carried over (hence the retention of the R20/R30 chassis codes), but the styling fully refreshed. At this time, the LiteAce van became a derivative of the TownAce line, sharing the latter's body work. Thus, from this time, the entire LiteAce and TownAce range (van and truck) were unified. The rebodied R20/R30 had a much more streamlined design. The LiteAce and TownAce commercial vans were very similar, differing by the TownAce receiving extra headlamps adjacent inside to the main units and a small air intake slit. The LiteAce did not have this intake, but instead had additional grilles where the extra lamps in the TownAce were. Passenger wagons of both models had different styling again. Here, the LiteAce front end featured two separate <b>headlamp</b> <b>units</b> that tapered inwards towards the Toyota logo. TownAce wagons had headlamps that sat flush with a translucent garnish that gave {{the appearance of a}} large, single headlamp. Rear styling also differed between the commercial vans and passenger wagons, although both models used the same rear-end regardless if badged LiteAce or TownAce.|$|R
