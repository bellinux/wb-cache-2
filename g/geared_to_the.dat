25|$|Early Zionist pioneers were {{impressed}} {{by the fact that}} the calendar preserved by Jews over many centuries in far-flung diasporas, as a matter of religious ritual, was <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> climate of their original country: the Jewish New Year marks the transition from the dry season to the rainy one, and major Jewish holidays such as Sukkot, Passover, and Shavuot correspond to major points of the country's agricultural year such as planting and harvest.|$|E
25|$|Each {{time the}} {{pendulum}} swings through its centre position, it releases one tooth of the escape wheel (g). The {{force of the}} clock's mainspring or a driving weight hanging from a pulley, transmitted through the clock's gear train, causes the wheel to turn, and a tooth presses {{against one of the}} pallets (h), giving the pendulum a short push. The clock's wheels, <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> escape wheel, move forward a fixed amount with each pendulum swing, advancing the clock's hands at a steady rate.|$|E

They were interesting buses, quite faster than Leyland Tiger in use by other fleets. It was {{said at the time}} (early '60s) that the main reason was inter-urban gearing instead of purely urban gearing present in Leylands. An interesting feature was preselector gear-change, similar to those in Leyland buses, commanded by a smallish gated lever installed by the steering wheel, with a reversed gate, with first <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> right and up, and fourth <b>gear</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> bottom and left.|$|R

25|$|Works {{published}} by Mesorah under this imprint {{adhere to a}} perspective appealing to many Orthodox Jews, but especially to Orthodox Jews who have come from less religious backgrounds, but are returning to the faith (Baalei Teshuva). Due to {{the makeup of the}} Jewish community in the USA, most of the prayer books are <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Ashkenazic custom. In more recent years, Artscroll has collaborated with Sephardic community leaders in an attempt to bridge this gap. Examples of this include a Sephardic Haggadah {{published by}} Artscroll, written by Sephardic Rabbi Eli Mansour, and the book Aleppo, about a prominent Sephardic community in Syria.|$|E
25|$|Within the {{framework}} of the Law on Nine-Year Compulsory Education and the general trend toward vocational and technical skills, attempts were made to accommodate and correct the gap between urban and rural education. Urban and key schools almost invariably operated on a six-day full-time schedule to prepare students for further education and high-level jobs. Rural schools generally operated on a flexible schedule <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> needs of the agricultural seasons and sought to prepare students for adult life and manual labor in lower-skilled jobs. They also offered a more limited curriculum, often only Chinese, mathematics, and morals. To promote attendance and allow the class schedule and academic year to be completed, agricultural seasons were taken into account. School holidays were moved, school days shortened, and full-time, half-time, and spare-time classes offered in the slack agricultural seasons. Sometimes itinerant teachers were hired for mountain villages and served one village in the morning, another village in the afternoon.|$|E

25|$|Activities and {{functions}} of R are highly confidential and declassification of past operations are uncommon unlike agencies like CIA, MI6 and Mossad who have many of their activities declassified. The Secretary (R) reported to the Vohra Committee that R offices abroad have limited strength and are largely <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> collection of military, economic, scientific and political intelligence. R monitors the activities of certain organisations abroad only insofar {{as they relate to}} their involvement with narco terrorist elements and smuggling arms, ammunition, explosives, etc. into India. It does not monitor the activities of criminal elements abroad, which are mainly confined to normal smuggling without any links to terrorist elements. However, if there is evidence to suggest that certain organisations have links with Intelligence agencies of other countries, and that they are being used or are likely to be used by such countries for destabilising India's economy, it would become R's responsibility to monitor their activities.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of the}} 2014 Lexus IS sports sedan {{launch in}} the US, 2 new {{television}} ads (Crowd, Color Shift) were produced by Lexus' agency of record, Team One, with Original music from Devo's Mark Mothersbaugh, and directed by Jonas Åkerlund. The 'Crowd' ad emphasizes that things designed to draw a crowd are good, but leaving the crowd behind is more rewarding. The 'Color Shift' ad shows it's more fun and exciting to blend out than blend in. The Two additional ads (This is Your Move, Intense) were created by Lexus' multicultural agency, Walton Isaacson, {{as part of the}} campaign. 'This is Your Move' was <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> African-American audience, features Los Angeles Dodgers center fielder Matt Kemp as he searches for something that matches his ambitious and driven personality. 'Intense' is targeted to the Hispanic audience and follows a young couple as they experience the thrills of driving the redesigned IS 250.|$|E
500|$|The Mahans' {{propulsion}} plant was considerably improved over {{that of the}} Farraguts. Steam pressure was raised from [...] to [...] in some ships, and superheated steam temperature was raised from [...] to [...] in all ships. Double reduction gearing replaced single reduction gearing, allowing smaller, faster-turning turbines to be used; this saved enough space and weight to allow cruising turbines to be fitted, which greatly improved fuel economy at moderate speeds. Boiler economizers, as in previous ships, further improved fuel economy. The ships' range was extended to [...] at , [...] farther than the Farraguts. Design shaft horsepower was increased from [...] to [...] in the same space and weight as in the Farraguts. The relatively compact power plant contributed to the Mahans' ability to carry 12 torpedo tubes instead of eight with only 150 tons extra displacement. The main turbines were manufactured by General Electric and were impulse-type, also called Curtis turbines. Each main turbine was divided into a high-pressure (HP) and a low-pressure (LP) turbine feeding into a common reduction gear to drive a shaft, {{in a similar manner}} to the machinery illustrated at the following reference. Steam from the boilers was supplied to the HP turbine, which exhausted to the LP turbine, which exhausted to a condenser. The cruising turbines were <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> HP turbines and could be engaged or disengaged as needed; at low speeds they were operated in series with the HP turbines to improve the efficiency of the overall turbine arrangement, thus improving fuel economy. This general arrangement with double reduction gearing became standard for most subsequent steam-powered surface ships of the US Navy, although not all of these had cruising turbines.|$|E

2500|$|He {{moved back}} to his beloved California in the early 1960s. During this time he began working for the Hollywood film industry, and he enjoyed {{tremendous}} popular success writing music for film and television. He wrote much background and theme music for motion pictures, including the films Sex and the Single Girl, How to Murder Your Wife (1965), Synanon, Boeing Boeing (1965), Lord Love a Duck (1966), Duel at Diablo (1966), Barefoot in the Park (1967), The Odd Couple (1968), and Harlow (1965), for which he received two Grammy nominations for the song [...] "Girl Talk".

2500|$|The {{system also}} models the {{phases of the}} moon. The moon pointer holds a shaft along its length, on which is mounted a small gear named r, which meshes to the sun pointer at B0 (the {{connection}} between B0 {{and the rest of}} B is not visible in the original mechanism, so whether b0 is the current date/mean sun pointer or a hypothetical true sun pointer is not known). The gear rides around the dial with the moon, but is also <b>geared</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sun— the effect is to perform a differential gear operation, so the gear turns at the synodic month period, measuring in effect, the angle of the difference between the sun and moon pointers. [...] The gear drives a small ball that appears through an opening in the moon pointer's face, painted longitudinally half white and half black, displaying the phases pictorially. It turns with a modelled rotational period of 29.53 days; the modern value for the synodic month is 29.530589 days.|$|E
