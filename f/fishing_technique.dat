25|$|Historically, {{cormorant}} fishing {{has been}} a significant <b>fishing</b> <b>technique</b> in China. To control the birds, the fishermen tie a snare near the base of the bird's throat. This prevents the birds from swallowing larger fish, which are held in their throat. When a cormorant has caught a fish, the fisherman brings the bird back to the boat and has the bird spit the fish out. Chinese fishermen often employ great cormorants. Though cormorant fishing used to be a successful fishing industry, its primary use today is to serve the tourism industry. In Guilin, Guangxi Province, cormorant birds are famous for fishing on the shallow Lijiang River.|$|E

Both times, he was successfully guided back to the Pacific Ocean using a [...] "sound net" [...] in which people in a flotilla of boats made unpleasant noises behind the whale by banging on steel pipes, a Japanese <b>fishing</b> <b>technique</b> known as oikami. At the same time, the attractive sounds of humpback whales preparing to feed were broadcast from a boat headed towards the open ocean.|$|E

2500|$|The <b>fishing</b> <b>technique,</b> quite efficacious, is [...] "on sight". It {{consists}} of intercepting, with wide nets, the flows of fish moving along the ravines of the coast. Trabucchi are located where {{the sea is}} deep enough (at least 6 meters), and are built on rocky peaks generally oriented southeast or north in order to exploit the favorable marine current.|$|E
2500|$|Drag {{systems are}} a {{mechanical}} means of applying variable {{pressure to the}} line spool or drive mechanism in order {{to act as a}} friction brake against it. [...] This supplies resistance to the line after hook-up to aid in landing the fish without the line breaking. In combination with rod flex and <b>fishing</b> <b>technique,</b> this allows larger fish to be caught than the straight breaking strength of the line would suggest.|$|E
2500|$|Trout tend {{mostly to}} feed underwater. When fishing deeper waters such as rivers or lakes, putting a fly {{down to the}} trout may be more {{successful}} than fishing on the surface, especially {{in the absence of}} any surface insect activity or hatch. The nymph itself can be weighted, as is the popular bead headed hare's ear nymph or bead headed pheasant tail nymph. Alternatively, the angler can use an attractor pattern such as a prince nymph. Weights can be added to the leader. Probably the best weight to use is twist on lead or other metal strips because it has a much less detrimental effect on the casting ability. A sinking tip fly line can also serve to sink the fly. A common nymphing and general overall fly <b>fishing</b> <b>technique</b> that even beginners can master is a [...] "dead drift" [...] or tight line <b>fishing</b> <b>technique,</b> casting directly across the river, letting the fly line drift downriver while keeping any slack out of the line. If the Nymph is drifting too fast, then you should perform an upstream mend. If the nymph is drifting too slowly, you should mend downstream. A beginner need simply to point the rod at the fly, lifting the rod in the event of a strike. This is a [...] "downstream technique" [...] where the angler moves in a downstream direction. More advanced techniques make use of a highly visible strike indicator attached to the leader above the sinking fly.|$|E

40|$|We have {{recently}} {{carried out a}} cytogenetic survey {{of a series of}} non-Hodgkin's lymphomas (NHLs) and identified chro-mosomal abnormalities in most of the samples studied. A third of these cases, however, had to be recorded as contain-ing derivative or marker chromosomes, whose origins were either partially or completely unknown. In an attempt to fur-ther analyse such cases, we have adopted the fluorescence in situ hybridization (<b>FISH)</b> <b>technique.</b> The <b>FISH</b> <b>technique</b> has allowed us to map the myb gene to 6 q 23, and then to study its position on 6 q ~ derivative chromosomes in the NHL cells. The related <b>FISH</b> <b>technique</b> of chromosome painting has enabled us to identify a marker chromosome in one of our cases as an abnormal X chromosome, and in other cases has allowed 14 q+ derivative chromosomes to be further analysed. We have also applied the <b>FISH</b> <b>technique</b> to the analysis of interphase nuclei, and have been able to determine numerical chromosome changes in NHL interphase cells. The applica-tion of the <b>FISH</b> <b>technique</b> to the study of NHL cell chromo-somes is likely to enable the identification of most chromoso-mal abnormalities present, and so may reveal the critical events leading to malignant transformation of lymphoid cells...|$|R
