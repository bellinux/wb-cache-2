500|$|... "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg," [...] the Ramones 1985 single, pictured Reagan's {{controversial}} {{visit to}} a German military cemetery in Bitburg earlier that year. Critics in the U.S., Europe, and Israel decried the presidential visit because among the 2,000 German soldiers buried there were 49 members of the Waffen-SS who had committed genocidal atrocities. The phrase [...] "Bonzo Goes to Bitburg" [...] was coined by protesters in {{the weeks leading up}} to Reagan's trip. Before the trip, Reagan ignited more controversy when he expressed his belief that the soldiers buried at Bitburg [...] "were victims, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> the victims in the concentration camps." ...|$|E
2500|$|Peter Beaumont, {{writing in}} The Observer, agrees that {{proponents of the}} concept of [...] "new antisemitism" [...] have {{attempted}} to co-opt anti-Jewish sentiment and attacks by some European Muslims as a way to silence opposition to the policies of the Israeli government. [...] "riticise Israel," [...] he writes, [...] "and you are an anti-Semite <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> if you were throwing paint at a synagogue in Paris." ...|$|E
2500|$|Prichard and Eisenhower {{exchanged}} correspondence {{during the}} war. [...] Shortly after the United States entered the war, in December 1941, Eisenhower {{wrote a letter}} to Prichard in which he confided [...] "this is a long tough road we have to travel." [...] In an oft-quoted passage, Eisenhower continued his comments to Prichard, noting that [...] "men that can do {{things are going to be}} sought out <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> the sun rises in the morning," [...] and [...] "fake reputations, habits of glib and clever speech, and glittering surface performances are going to be discovered." ...|$|E
60|$|The {{two boys}} {{who had been}} {{splitting}} wood ceased from their labours and straightened their backs; suddenly the smaller of the two gave the other a resounding whack with a split lath that he still held in his hand, and flew up the hillside with a scream of laughter and simulated terror, the bigger lad following in hot pursuit. Up and down the steep bush-grown slope they raced and twisted and dodged, coming sometimes to close quarters in a hurricane of squeals and smacks, rolling over and over like fighting kittens, and breaking away again to start fresh provocation and fresh pursuit. Now and again they would lie for a time panting in what seemed the last stage of exhaustion, {{and then they would}} be off in another wild scamper, their dusky bodies flitting through the bushes, disappearing and reappearing with equal suddenness. Presently two girls of their own age, who had returned from the water-fetching, sprang out on them from ambush, and the four joined in one joyous gambol that lit up the hillside with shrill echoes and glimpses of flying limbs. Comus sat and watched, at first with an amused interest, then with a returning flood of depression and heart-ache. Those wild young human kittens represented the joy of life, he was the outsider, the lonely alien, watching something in which he could not join, a happiness in which he had no part or lot. He would pass presently out of the village and his bearers' feet would leave their indentations in the dust; that would be his most permanent memorial in this little oasis of teeming life. And that other life, in which he once moved with such confident sense of his own necessary participation in it, how completely he had passed out of it. Amid all its laughing throngs, its card parties and race- meetings and country-house gatherings, he was just a mere name, remembered or forgotten, Comus Bassington, the boy who went away. He had loved himself very well and never troubled greatly whether anyone else really loved him, and now he realised what he had made of his life. And {{at the same time he}} knew that if his chance were to come again he would throw it away <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely,</b> <b>just</b> <b>as</b> perversely. Fate played with him with loaded dice; he would lose always.|$|R
6000|$|... "These are our ancestors, {{and their}} history is our history. Remember that <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> we one day swung {{down out of}} the trees and walked upright, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely,</b> on a far earlier day, did we crawl up out of the sea and achieve our first {{adventure}} on land." ...|$|R
60|$|It was nervous, {{tingling}} work, for <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> I sensed {{his intention}} of briefness, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> had he sensed mine. I doubt that I {{could have done}} the trick had it been broad day instead of moonlight. The dim light aided me. Also was I aided by divining, the moment in advance, {{what he had in}} mind. It was the time attack, a common but perilous trick that every novice knows, that has laid on his back many a good man who attempted it, and that is so fraught with danger to the perpetrator that swordsmen are not enamoured of it.|$|R
2500|$|The {{court found}} that [...] "oppose" [...] is not defined by the statute, so a normal {{definition}} of it may be used, per Perrin v. United States. [...] "Thus, a person can 'oppose' by responding to someone else’s questions <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> by provoking the discussion," [...] further [...] "we would call it 'opposition' if an employee took a stand against an employer’s discriminatory practices not by 'instigating' action, but by standing pat, say, by refusing to follow a supervisor’s order to fire a junior worker for discriminatory reasons." [...] The court supposes {{there could be a}} hypothetical case in which an employee describes a [...] "supervisor's racist joke as hilarious," [...] but finds that these [...] "will be eccentric cases, and this is not one of them." ...|$|E
2500|$|The State Supreme Court {{wrote that}} a scandalous {{publication}} [...] "annoys, injures and endangers the comfort and repose of {{a considerable number}} of persons," [...] and so constituted a nuisance <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> [...] "places where intoxicating liquor is illegally sold," [...] "houses of prostitution," [...] "dogs," [...] "malicious fences" [...] "itinerant carnivals," [...] "lotteries," [...] and [...] "noxious weeds." [...] The court considered that a newspaper may also endanger safety, because [...] "scandalous material" [...] tended to disturb the peace and provoke assaults. The court cited previous Minnesota decisions that upheld the right of the state to enjoin the publication of [...] "details of execution of criminals" [...] and the teaching of [...] "things injurious to society." [...] Restricting the publication of a newspaper based on its harmful content accordingly fell within the legitimate power of [...] "the people speaking through their representatives" [...] to preserve [...] "public morals" [...] and the [...] "public welfare." [...] The court stated that it had to give heavy deference to such decisions, because [...] "it is the prerogative of the legislature to determine not only what the public interests require but also the measures necessary to protect such interests." ...|$|E

60|$|But {{all this}} time we have been only looking at {{one side of the}} question, for there exists an {{abundance}} of facts which seem to imply, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely,</b> the utter uselessness of cross-fertilisation. Let us, then, see what these facts are before proceeding further.|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot just yet," [...] he answered. [...] "All that I {{can promise}} you is that, if I am successful, {{it will stop}} the war <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> Captain Graham's new explosive." ...|$|E
60|$|Elsa {{had promised}} before God {{and before the}} whole village that she would marry Erös Béla on the feast of St. Michael and All Angels, and after that single thought of rebellion, she knew that on the {{following}} Tuesday this {{would have to be}} <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> the day follows the night and the night the day.|$|E
6000|$|When {{the creatures}} had gone, the girl turned toward Bradley. [...] "Why {{did you have}} them bring us here?" [...] she asked. [...] "Now we are far from my country. We may never live to reach it, as we are among enemies who, while not so horrible will kill us <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> would the Wieroos should they capture us, and we have before us many marches through lands filled with savage beasts." ...|$|E

60|$|C. Wal. Well--the {{world is}} right well made, that's certain; and He {{who made the}} Jews' sin our {{salvation}} may bring plenty out of famine, and comfort out of covetousness.

6000|$|... "How {{could you}} know, Crystal?" [...] the voice replied. [...] "You could know that, my dear, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> {{you know that}} in a stormy night the sky is dark, just as you know that when heavy clouds obscure the blue ether above, no ray of {{sunshine}} warms the shivering earth.

6000|$|... ... If {{the great}} American people only keep their temper {{on both sides}} of the line, the {{troubles}} will come to an end, and the question which now distracts the country will be settled, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> all other difficulties of a like character which have originated in this government have been adjusted. Let the people on both sides keep their self-possession, and just as other clouds have cleared away in due time, so will this great nation continue to prosper as heretofore.|$|E
60|$|A {{whole day}} in the lonely forest passed swiftly, yet it left a feeling of long time. She lived by her thoughts. Always the morning was bright, sunny, sweet and {{fragrant}} and colorful, and her mood was pensive, wistful, dreamy. And always, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> the hours passed, thought intruded upon her happiness, and thought brought memory, and memory brought shame, and shame brought fight. Sunset after sunset she had dragged herself back to the ranch, sullen and sick and beaten. Yet she never ceased to struggle.|$|E
5000|$|... “At {{that moment}} I knew, surely and clearly, that I was {{witnessing}} perfection.

60|$|Andre-Louis, however, still went {{on eating}} stolidly, {{without so much}} as a look in her direction. Gradually the company came to realize that <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> a scene was brooding, just so surely would there be no scene as long as they {{remained}}. It was Polichinelle, at last, who gave the signal by rising and withdrawing, and within two minutes none remained in the room but M. Binet, his daughter, and Andre-Louis. And then, at last, Andre-Louis set down knife and fork, washed his throat with a draught of Burgundy, and sat back in his chair to consider Climene.|$|E
6000|$|But {{he did not}} go far. A dozen steps, perhaps, and he came to {{a sudden}} stop. [...] "He is an Englishman," [...] he muttered, [...] "and the other is a woman. They can never reach the {{settlements}} without my help. I could not kill her with my own hands when I tried, and if I let them go on alone, I will have killed her <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> though I had run my knife into her heart. No," [...] and again he shook his head. [...] "Tarzan of the Apes is a fool and a weak, old woman," [...] and he turned back toward the south.|$|E
60|$|And, finally, Giotto {{believed}} {{that all he}} was called on to represent, concerning St. Francis, really had taken place, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> you, {{if you are a}} Christian, believe that Christ died and rose again; and he represents it with all fidelity and passion: but, as I just now said, {{he is a man of}} supreme common sense;--has as much humour and clearness of sight as Chaucer, and as much dislike of falsehood in clergy, or in professedly pious people: and in his gravest moments he will still see and say truly that what is fat, is fat--and what is lean, lean--and what is hollow, empty.|$|E
6000|$|... 'You will,' replied Plantagenet; 'your destiny {{requires}} it. You {{will see}} him <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> you beheld that portrait {{that it was}} the labour of a life to prevent you beholding.' ...|$|R
60|$|In justice, too, pity her. For <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> ever {{woman was}} killed by man, I killed Mrs. Wessington. And the last portion of my {{punishment}} is even now upon me.|$|R

6000|$|... "A close {{neighbor}} of Thunderfoot's {{in the days}} when he was Lord of the Prairies was Fleetfoot the Antelope. Fleetfoot {{is about the size of}} a small Deer, and in his graceful appearance reminds one of Lightfoot, for he has the same trim body and long slim legs. He is built for speed and looks it. From just a glance at him you would know him for a runner <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> a look at Jumper the Hare would tell you that he must travel in great bounds. The truth is, Fleetfoot is the fastest runner among all my children in this country. Not one can keep up with him in a race.|$|E
6000|$|Again, in the [...] "Lancaster Sands," [...] {{which is}} one of the plates I have marked as most {{desirable}} for your possession; the stream of light which falls from the setting sun on the advancing tide stands similarly in need of some force of near object to relieve its brightness. But the incident which Turner has here adopted is the swoop of an angry seagull at a dog, who yelps at it, drawing back as the wave rises over his feet, and the bird shrieks within a foot of his face. Its unexpected boldness is a type of the anger of its ocean element, and warns us of the sea's advance <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> the abandoned plough told us of the ceased labour of the day.|$|E
60|$|One of {{the great}} errors which we have been called on, of recent years, to unlearn, is the {{supposed}} irregularity and uncertainty of the winds and waves. Nothing is more regular, nothing more certain--not even the rising and setting of the sun himself--than the circulation of the waters and the winds of earth. The apparent irregularity and uncertainty lies in our limited power and range of perception. The laws by which God regulates the winds and waves are as fixed as is the law of gravitation, and every atom of air, every drop of water, moves in its appointed course in strict obedience to those laws, <b>just</b> <b>as</b> <b>surely</b> <b>as</b> the apple, when severed from the bough, obeys the law of gravitation, and falls to the ground.|$|E
