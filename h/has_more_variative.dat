The learning approach that can attract the studentsâ€™ interest and correlate the science, environment, technology, and society aspects, and therefore enhance the studentsâ€™ academic result, should be applied. This research was conducted using quasi-experimental method with cluster random sampling technique. The developed instruments consist of the learning sets using salingtemas approach, test sets, observation and questionnaire sheets. The result of this {{research shows that the}} chemistry learning on chemical bond topic using salingtemas approach is effective to enhance the studentsâ€™ academic result and come up the studentsâ€™ learning interest.

40|$|Students’ {{academic}} achievement {{is one of}} main indicator of education goals. This research aimed to analyze adolescents’ characteristics, family’s characteristics, academic emotions, and learning strategies, {{and its effect on}} {{academic achievement}} of high school students. The locations were chosen purposively in Bogor District. Samples of this study were 132 high school students from both X and Y high schools by proportional random sampling technique. Data were collected through questionnaires and filled-in by samples. The data analysis used descriptive analysis (minimum value, maximum value, average, standard deviation, and frequency) and inferential analysis (Spearman correlation test, Pearson correlation test, and multiple linear regression test). Result showed that positive-activation emotion was mostly felt by adolescents. Learning strategies that mostly used were time/study environment management and help-seeking, meanwhile in general learning strategy usage was still low. Female students engaged <b>more</b> <b>variative</b> learning strategies and better academic achievement than male students. Positive-activation emotion had increased the learning strategies, and the variety of learning strategies usage will affect academic achievement positively. Meanwhile, family characteristics was found have no significant effect on learning neither strategies nor academic achievement...|$|R
40|$|This {{research}} aims {{to design}} pyrolysis reactor, develop pyrolysis operating procedure, and {{to investigate the}} effect of pyrolysis temperature to liquid product quality. The pyrolysis experiments will be performed in batch reactor equipped from carbon steel with 20 cm inside diameter and 40 cm height. The experimental conditions are as follows: temperature range 250 - 400 degrees C, and reaction time 0 - 30 min. The effect of inert (N 2) flow rate to liquid product quality will also be observed. From all variables studied, it seemed that temperature had the highest effect. Chemical reaction rate constant was affected by temperature in accordance with Arrhenius equation. The activation energy of k was 12145, 4 cal. /mole, respectively. This value was not {{so far from the}} extreme values (104 cal/mole) presented by Westerterp et al. These facts ascertained that the chemical reaction step controlled the overall rate of reaction. The highest volatile matter conversion in this research was 46, 5 %, and this was obtained at process conditions of 30 minutes and temperature of 360 oC.

40|$|While {{friendship}} {{patterns and}} the relationship between friendship status and school adjustment have been studied in same-age classrooms, little is known about friendship patterns and the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in mixed-age classrooms. The purposes of the present study were to investigate friendship patterns in a large sample of mixed-age (ungraded) primary classrooms and to examine the contribution of friendship status to school adjustment in a smaller subsample of ungraded primary children. Peer acceptance level and age relative to classmates both {{had a significant impact on}} the number of reciprocated friends children had, and on the relative age of their friends. High-accepted and relatively old children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> reciprocated friends than did less accepted and relatively young children. Also, high-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old, and intermediate age friends than did than average- and low-accepted children, and average-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends at all relative ages than did low-accepted children. Children who were older in relative age <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends who were also older in relative age than did children who were intermediate and young in relative age. Intermediate age children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than did relatively young children. Chi square tests of independence revealed that low-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends who were young in relative age, and high-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than expected by random pairing, and that relatively young children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively young friends and relatively old children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than expected by random pairing. There were some similarities in friendship patterns between the larger data sample and the school adjustment subsample. Peer acceptance influenced friendship patterns in a similar manner, however, there was no significant effect of relative age. Also, high- and average-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> friends who were young and intermediate in relative age than did relatively young children. High-accepted children also <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than did average and low-accepted children, and average-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends than did low-accepted children. Chi-square analysis revealed patterns similar to those in the larger sample; high-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively old friends and low-accepted children <b>had</b> <b>more</b> relatively young friends than expected. There was no significant of relative age on the relative age of children 2 ̆ 7 s friends. In the school adjustment subsample, children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math, reading, and science were positively related to math, reading, and science achievement scores. Friendship status was significantly related to children 2 ̆ 7 s attitudes toward math and achievement scores. Specifically, if children had at least one friend, they <b>had</b> <b>more</b> positive attitudes toward math and higher average achievement scores. Also, females <b>had</b> <b>more</b> positive attitudes toward math, but not other subjects...|$|R
