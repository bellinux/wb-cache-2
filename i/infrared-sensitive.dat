50|$|Rattlesnakes {{have evolved}} {{specialized}} sensory organs (<b>infrared-sensitive</b> pit organs) that enhance {{their ability to}} predate small mammals. This ability to sense in the infrared {{set the stage for}} ground squirrels to evolve antipredator counter-innovations that take advantage of the specialized sensory organs of rattlesnakes. Owings and colleagues found that ground squirrels shunt blood to their tails when encountering rattlesnakes. This allows ground squirrels to tail flag to rattlesnakes even in the dark with their hot tails that rattlesnakes can detect with <b>infrared-sensitive</b> pit organs. Ground squirrels do not shunt blood to their tails when they encounter gopher snakes, which also feed on their young, but lack <b>infrared-sensitive</b> pit organs.|$|E

50|$|From 1929, Tihanyi {{worked on}} {{television}} guidance for defense applications, building prototypes {{of a camera}} for remotely guided aircraft in London for the British Air Ministry, and later adapting it for the Italian Navy. In 1929, he invented the first <b>infrared-sensitive</b> (night vision) electronic television camera for anti-aircraft defense in Britain.|$|E
50|$|Ciol has {{concentrated}} on creating a photographic record and archive of Italian works of art, architecture, landscapes, and archaeological sites and artefacts, particularly in Friuli.

50|$|The {{spectral}} {{standards for}} M-type stars have changed slightly over the years, but settled down somewhat {{since the early}} 1990s. Part of {{this is due to}} the fact that even the nearest red dwarfs are fairly faint, and the study of mid- to late-M dwarfs has progressed only in the past few decades due to evolution of astronomical techniques, from photographic plates to charged-couple devices (CCDs) to <b>infrared-sensitive</b> arrays.|$|E
50|$|Washing {{plates in}} water, dilute ammonia, {{triethanolamine}} or (more recently) silver nitrate solutions {{was found to}} be very effective, especially for red- and <b>infrared-sensitive</b> materials. Later types of fine grain, near-IR-sensitive plates were unusable without such hypersensitizing. However, much skill and persistence was required to obtain consistent and uniform results, especially with large plates, which were often treated at unsocial hours in observatory darkrooms on remote mountain tops.|$|E
50|$|Some {{of these}} methods {{detected}} not the submarine itself, but the disturbances it made in the sea. If its passage mixed layers of cold surface and underlying warm water, this would raise the apparent surface temperature slightly. This temperature change could be detected using an <b>infrared-sensitive</b> thermometer. Although impossible to detect by measuring {{the temperature in the}} wake, imaging the temperature of the overall sea would show the wake as standing out from it.|$|E
50|$|In 1929, Hungarian {{physicist}} Kálmán Tihanyi {{invented the}} <b>infrared-sensitive</b> (night vision) electronic television camera for anti-aircraft defense in Britain. The first thermographic cameras developed were infrared line scanners. This {{was created by}} the US military and Texas Instruments in 1947 and took one hour to produce a single image. While several approaches were investigated to improve the speed and accuracy of the technology, one of the most crucial factors dealt with scanning an image, which the AGA company was able to commercialize using a cooled photoconductor.|$|E
50|$|Certain <b>infrared-sensitive</b> {{films like}} Kodak HIE must only be loaded and {{unloaded}} in total darkness. Infrared black-and-white films require special development times but development is usually achieved with standard black-and-white film developers and chemicals (like D-76). Kodak HIE film has a polyester film base {{that is very}} stable but extremely easy to scratch, therefore special care must {{be used in the}} handling of Kodak HIE throughout the development and printing/scanning process to avoid damage to the film. The Kodak HIE film was sensitive to 900 nm.|$|E
50|$|Laser tag is a tag {{game played}} with guns which fire {{infrared}} beams. <b>Infrared-sensitive</b> targets are commonly worn by each player and are sometimes integrated within the {{arena in which}} the game is played. Since its birth in 1979, {{with the release of}} the Star Trek Electronic Phasers toy manufactured by the South Bend Electronics brand of Milton Bradley, laser tag has evolved into both indoor and outdoor styles of play, and may include simulations of combat, role play-style games, or competitive sporting events including tactical configurations and precise game goals.|$|E
50|$|Kürten and Schmidt (1982) first {{suggested}} that the location and orientation of each pit structure provided directional information in infrared radiation detection. From their initial studies, the nasal pits seemed to be ideal for purposes of IR-perception. Later in 1984, Kürten and collaborators made electrophysiological recordings from nerve fibers of temperature-sensitive infrared thermoreceptors located on the central nose-leaf and upper lip, but did not find such receptors in the nasal pits (see Physiology). This revoked their earlier hypothesis and established that the <b>infrared-sensitive</b> receptors are located on the central nose-leaf. Schäfer and collaborators confirmed this by recording impulses from thermoreceptors on the nose-leaf as well.|$|E
5000|$|When these {{filters are}} used {{together}} with <b>infrared-sensitive</b> film or sensors, [...] "in-camera effects" [...] can be obtained; false-color or black-and-white images with a dreamlike or sometimes lurid appearance {{known as the}} [...] "Wood Effect," [...] an effect mainly caused by foliage (such as tree leaves and grass) strongly reflecting {{in the same way}} visible light is reflected from snow. There is a small contribution from chlorophyll fluorescence, but this is marginal and is not the real cause of the brightness seen in infrared photographs. The effect is named after the infrared photography pioneer Robert W. Wood, and not after the material wood, which does not strongly reflect infrared.|$|E
50|$|Arguably the {{greatest}} obstacle to infrared film photography {{has been the}} increasing difficulty of obtaining <b>infrared-sensitive</b> film. However, despite the discontinuance of HIE, other newer infrared sensitive emulsions from EFKE, ROLLEI, and ILFORD are still available, but these formulations have differing sensitivity and specifications from the venerable KODAK HIE that {{has been around for}} at least two decades. Some of these infrared films are available in 120 and larger formats as well as 35 mm, which adds flexibility to their application. With the discontinuance of Kodak HIE, Efke's IR820 film has become the only IR film on the market with good sensitivity beyond 750 nm, the Rollei film does extend beyond 750 nm but IR sensitivity falls off very rapidly.|$|E
50|$|Vampire bats are {{the only}} known mammals whose entire {{nutrition}} relies on blood from mammals or birds. In the family Phyllostomidae and the subfamily Desmodontinae, there are three known species of vampire bats: Desmodus rotundus (common vampire bat), Diphylla ecaudata (hairy-legged vampire bat), and Diaemus youngi (white-winged vampire bat). Most of the referenced research on infrared sensing in vampire bats {{has been done on}} the common vampire bat because this is the most commonly found species. These bats have developed a specialized system using <b>infrared-sensitive</b> receptors on their nose-leaf to prey on homeothermic (warm-blooded) vertebrates. Trigeminal nerve fibers that innervate these IR-sensitive receptors may be involved in detection of infrared thermal radiation emitted by their prey. This may aid bats in locating blood-rich areas on their prey. In addition, neuroanatomical and molecular research has suggested possible similarities of IR-sensing mechanisms between vampire bats and IR-sensitive snakes. Infrared sensing in vampire bats has not yet been hypothesized to be image forming, as it was for IR-sensitive snakes. While the literature on IR-sensing in vampire bats is thin, progress continues to be made in this field to identify how vampire bats can sense and use infrared thermal radiation.|$|E
5000|$|The {{difficulty}} in constructing high-quality, high-resolution FPAs {{derives from the}} materials used. Whereas visible imagers such as CCD and CMOS image sensors are fabricated from silicon, using mature and well-understood processes, IR sensors must be fabricated from other, more exotic materials because silicon is sensitive only in the visible and near-IR spectra. <b>Infrared-sensitive</b> materials commonly used in IR detector arrays include mercury cadmium telluride (HgCdTe, [...] "MerCad", or [...] "MerCadTel"), indium antimonide (InSb, pronounced [...] "Inns-Bee"), indium gallium arsenide (InGaAs, pronounced [...] "Inn-Gas"), and vanadium(V) oxide (VOx, pronounced [...] "Vox"). A variety of lead salts can also be used, but are less common today. None of these materials can be grown into crystals anywhere near the size of modern silicon crystals, nor do the resulting wafers have nearly the uniformity of silicon. Furthermore, the materials used to construct arrays of IR-sensitive pixels cannot be used to construct the electronics needed to transport the resulting charge, voltage, or resistance of each pixel to the measurement circuitry. This set of functions is implemented on a chip called the multiplexer, or readout integrated circuits (ROIC), and is typically fabricated in silicon using standard CMOS processes. The detector array is then hybridized or bonded to the ROIC, typically using indium bump-bonding, and the resulting assembly is called an FPA.|$|E
