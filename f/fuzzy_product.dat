By considering the influences of sensor faults on both the system states and premise variables of fuzzy controllers, a class of new convex reliable stabilization conditions are proposed for T-S fuzzy systems through using the properties of <b>fuzzy</b> <b>product</b> inference engines. Furthermore, the obtained result is extended to the H ∞ reliable control case. The resulting controllers are reliable in that they provide guaranteed asymptot-ic stability and H ∞ performance when all sensors are operational as well as when some sensor experiences failures.

Consequently, they need to define a generic product structure to support product configurations that covers all product types such as hardware, software and services.
