5|$|Securely {{attached}} adults tend to {{have positive}} views of themselves, their partners and their relationships. They feel comfortable with intimacy and independence, balancing the two. Anxious-preoccupied adults seek high levels of intimacy, approval and responsiveness from partners, becoming overly dependent. They {{tend to be less}} trusting, have less positive views about themselves and their partners, and may exhibit high levels of emotional expressiveness, worry and impulsiveness in their relationships. Dismissive-avoidant adults desire a high level of independence, often appearing to avoid attachment altogether. They view themselves as self-sufficient, invulnerable to attachment feelings and not needing close relationships. They tend to suppress their feelings, dealing with rejection by distancing themselves from partners of whom they often have a poor opinion. Fearful-avoidant adults <b>have</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>feelings</b> about close relationships, both desiring and feeling uncomfortable with emotional closeness. They tend to mistrust their partners and view themselves as unworthy. Like dismissive-avoidant adults, fearful-avoidant adults tend to seek less intimacy, suppressing their feelings.|$|E

Club {{agreed that}} the scene between Coach and his {{daughter}} at the office is the most redeeming part of the episode, but they <b>have</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>feelings</b> {{about the rest of}} the episode.

Others praised this episode overall, including moments outside the story of Coach's daughter. Erik Adams observed that Coach can immediately sense a bad aspect about Roy, even when he is a [...] "simpleton".|$|E
500|$|Within a {{few weeks}} of signing with London, the A member who was {{negotiating}} with Sleep had been transferred and replaced. After sending the finished album to London Records, the label told Sleep that {{they were not going to}} release the album in its current format. London Records had David Sardy remix the album but the label were still confused as to what to do with the album. Sleep refused to have the album released in any edited form which led to a deadlock between London and the band. The members of Sleep <b>have</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>feelings</b> whether the album should have been released in general. Cisneros felt it should not have been released while Pike was content with its release, saying [...] "We did all the work so why leave it sitting around?" ...|$|E

2500|$|Observers in {{neighboring}} countries <b>have</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>feelings</b> {{of the overall}} deforestation of the Congo Basin. Some fear of famine as “farmers prefer to cut trees down to make charcoal and sell it ... rather than wait two years to harvest a field of cassava”. Also {{as a result of}} deforestation, hunting has decreased locally as animals are forced to move to new areas. Yet, others view the deforestation as simply a means of survival. Selling firewood can bring the equivalent of $1000 each month for those farmers able to produce one hundred 15-kilo sacks which sell for approximately $10 in most areas.|$|E
2500|$|People {{with this}} {{attachment}} style <b>have</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>feelings</b> about close relationships. On [...] one hand, they {{desire to have}} emotionally close relationships. On the other hand, they tend to feel uncomfortable with emotional closeness. These mixed feelings are combined with sometimes unconscious, negative views about themselves and their attachments. They commonly view themselves as unworthy of responsiveness from their attachments, and they don't trust the intentions of their attachments. Similar to the dismissive–avoidant attachment style, people with a fearful–avoidant attachment style seek less intimacy from attachments and frequently suppress and deny their feelings. Because of this, they are much less comfortable expressing affection.|$|E

2500|$|Mundungus [...] "Dung" [...] Fletcher is {{mentioned}} in passing {{in some of}} the earlier books in the series, but it is not until the second chapter of Harry Potter and the Order of the Phoenix that he makes his first appearance. Mundungus is described as a [...] "squat, unshaven man" [...] with [...] "short, bandy legs", [...] "long, straggly ginger hair", and [...] "bloodshot, baggy eyes that gave him the doleful look of a basset hound". He is involved in many illegal activities, yet he seems confined to relatively minor crimes, such as theft and trading stolen goods on the black market. Many members of the Order <b>have</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>feelings</b> about him, but he is very loyal to Dumbledore, who once got him out of serious trouble. His connections enable him to hear rumours and information rolling around the shadier segments of the wizarding population, which could potentially prove instrumental in the fight against Voldemort.|$|E
2500|$|Migration {{and drug}} {{smuggling}} problem has affected most border towns. Many people {{make a living}} by catering migrants or working as [...] "coyote" [...] guides. People hoping {{to cross the border}} and those recently deported crowd the border area; some of these people return home, but many others decide to stay on the Sonoran border, working to earn money for another attempt. These workers put a strain on insufficient municipal medical services. The walls, which have shut down much of the illegal crossing into Texas and California, have also been built on parts of the Arizona border, especially between towns such as the two Nacos and the two Nogaleses. The wall in Naco is four meters high and made of steel. It currently extends , but there are plans to extend it another [...] Security there was further tightened after the 2001 September 11 attacks. The U.S. Border Patrol credits the wall and better surveillance technology with cutting the number of captured border crossers near Naco by half in 2006. People {{on both sides of the}} wall <b>have</b> <b>mixed</b> <b>feelings</b> about it.|$|E
