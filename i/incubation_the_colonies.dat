My research question was: “Is there a significant mean difference among antiseptics used in medical institutions, {{in terms of their}} bactericidal effects on Staphylococous epidermidis in laboratory conditions evaluated by the use of Quantitative Suspension Test Method?” It was hypothesized {{that there would be a}} mean difference in between antiseptic properties of various agents. Since the antiseptics include different chemicals, they may have different bactericidal properties in terms of destroying microorganisms. In order to test the hypothesis and to answer the research question, Quantiative Suspension Test Method was used. S. epidermidis colonies were cultivated onto Mueller Hinton Plate. In order to compare the data, a control trial was needed. In my research, S. epidermidis suspensions were prepared, by using dilutions and then mixed with different brands of antiseptics. After 60 seconds of preparation the solution was neutralized. Then the suspensions were spreaded on a TSA and incubated for 24 hours at 37 °C. Following the <b>incubation</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> were taken out and counted by using a colored marker and multiplied by the dilution ratio in order to determine the actual number.

Low concentrations (0 to 1. 9 ppm) of NO were bacteriostatic to log-phase cultures of M. roseus, M. luteus, and Staphylococcus aureus grown on mineral salts glucose agar. Bacteriostatic activity over a 24 -h interval was maximal at an initial NO concentration of 1 ppm. Appreciable amounts of NO 2 were produced in 24 h at initial NO concentrations greater than 1 ppm.

40|$|Background This study {{investigated}} the effects of extremely low frequency (ELF) pulsed electromagnetic field (PEMF) radiation on the growth of bacterium Staphylococcus aureus (ATCC 25923) that plays a versatile role in infecting wounded tissues. The viability of these bacteria (number of live cells as colony-forming units (CFUs)) was measured {{before and after the}} ELF PEMF exposures to quantify their survival rate. Methods S. aureus cultures were first cultivated in an agar medium, and then picked and suspended in Columbia broth medium. Optical density reading for the suspended bacteria was measured at 600 nm and adjusted to a specific value of 0. 1 ±. 005 A prior to experimentation and placement of bacteria into 2. 5 mL centrifuge tubes. Sham-exposed tubes filled with bacteria were kept under the same experimental conditions and used as controls. The constructed exposure system, emitting uniform time varying magnetic fields (frequency of 2 - 500 Hz, and magnetic induction of 0. 5 - 2. 5 mT), was employed to irradiate S. aureus bacteria for 90 min. To determine the CFU per ml of the exposed bacteria, five serial dilutions were performed. A volume of 100 μl from the last tube was suspended onto agar plates by spread plating. After <b>incubation,</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> formed on the plates were visually counted. Results All irradiated S. aureus bacteria showed decrease in their growth rate compared to control samples. The results demonstrated that ELF PEMF exposures at 150 - 500 Hz are more effective than exposures at 3 - 100 Hz in reducing the viability of S. aureus in broth. The lowest CFU value was achieved with the exposure at 300 Hz and 1. 5 mT. The decrease of at least 20 % in CFU value was obtained for frequencies above 200 Hz and all five studied magnetic flux densities (0. 5 mT. 1. 0 mT, 1. 5 mT, 2. 0 mT, and 2. 5 mT). Conclusions In summary, the growth rate of the irradiated S. aureus bacteria is affected by radiation of particular parameters, thus revealing resonant effects induced by the applied radiation. The decreased CFU values in all irradiated samples compared to control samples (non-exposed) were observed.

Liquid egg products are generally pasteurized at moderate temperatures because of the heat sensitivity of the proteins and stored at refrigeration temperatures. Contamination by Salmonella, which remains the major safety preoccupation of this sector, is now {{under the control of}} breeding surveillance and of effective pasteurization processes. However, the manufacturers now encounter new types of microorganisms selected by the preservation processes themselves. The spoilage flora resisting to pasteurization may adhere on the surfaces of the pipelines or inside the stainless steel equipment. This flora may lead to the contamination of the egg product passing through the pipelines, hence causing a massive and fast contamination of the final egg product. The spoilage flora can lead to technological and/or organoleptic problems (coagulation, changes in colour or in flavour) due to the production of hydrolytic enzymes, even at low temperature. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the whole egg spoilage potential of isolates collected from stainless steel equipment in the egg processing industry. [br/]Material and methods: Sterile stainless steel chips were suspended inside the pipelines of 7 egg processing companies, at two process levels, before and after the pasteurizer, and at two seasons (summer and winter). After two months, the adhering flora was harvested by sonication and scrapping in tryptone salt, followed by plating onto BHI-YE agar and incubation for 1 to 7 day(s) at 30 °C, with or without oxygen. After <b>incubation,</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> were identified by 16 S rDNA sequencing. Isolates were selected for further in vitro investigation on their ability to adhere on stainless steel surfaces. After bacterial adhesion, sterile liquid whole egg was added on the chips and incubated at various temperatures. Enumeration and visual observations were carried out in order to detect contamination and spoilage, i. e. transformation of whole egg into a white slurry cream. Results: A broad range of diversity was highlighted even if a majority of facultative aero-anaerobic Gram positive bacteria was found, such as Streptococcus, Micrococcus, Staphylococcus, Microbacterium, Lysinibacillus and Bacillus. The adhesion capacity of the harvested isolates did not depend on their location in the process (before or after pasteurization), neither on the season (cold or warm) nor on the company. The level of adhesion depended more on the species than on the genus. While the whole collection was able to grow in liquid whole egg, only the genera Lysinibacillus and Bacillus were able to provoke a detectable spoilage. Significance: The adhesion of microorganisms on industrial surfaces is frequently observed in the food industry. Poorly controlled, adhering bacteria can be the source of food product contamination and/or food spoilage, and therefore can lead to high economic losses for the industry...|$|E
40|$|This diploma {{thesis is}} focused on the {{prevention}} and monitoring of healthcare-associated infections at the Hospital Prachatice, a. s. The main objective was to describe current situation in the field of prevention of nosocomial infections in this hospital. I focused on verification of medical personnel knowledge of nosocomial infections, the work of cleaners and the quality of hand hygiene of medical personnel. Diploma thesis {{is focused on}} the 4 selected departments of the hospital department of internal medicine, gynecology-obstetric department, surgical department and ARO and ICU. Thesis is divided into theoretical and practical part. The present knowledge about the healthcare-associated infections are processed in the theoretical part. To obtain all needed information was used domestic and foreign professional literature. The practical part was about the observation and the short research in the Hospital Prachatice, a. s. The research part was combined. The qualitative method including short interviews with the cleaners was combined with a quantitative method. Within this quantitative method have been used short questionnaires, which were intended for nurses. With these questionnaires I tried to find out their basic knowledge about nosocomial diseases and how they prevent them. The microbiological department of the Hospital Prachatice, a. s. was helpful in monitoring the quality of hand hygiene through method of microbiological fingerprinting. The questionnaires were handed out to nurses which worked on shift in that time on four mentioned departments of hospital. I return total 32 questionnaires back. Questionnaire had 11 questions and my plan was find out the basic knowledge of nurses about the issue. Interviews were conducted with cleaners working on focused departments where the research took place. The microbial fingerprints of hands were collected from medical staff on current work shift including doctors and cleaners. The fingerprints were made on blood agar where after 24 -hours of <b>incubation</b> <b>the</b> <b>colonies</b> of bacteria were evaluated. None of the fingerprints was completely negative. I determined totaly 4 research questions: 1. Are all workers of selected hospital departments well informed about nosocomial diseases? 2. What is the hygiene quality of hands among medical staff? 3. On what hygienic level is job of cleaners how often they are cleaning, which way and how often they are changing the working equipment and are the all hygiene criterions followed? 4. How is manipulated with laundry? The results of the questionnaires was surprised for me because most of the medical personnel correctly answered all the asked questions. It was found a total 16 kinds of gram+ and gram microorganisms during a hand hygiene by microbial fingerprints. Most occurred findings was Staphylococcus epidermidis and Microccocus species. In two cases occurred a epidemiologically significant Staphylococcus aureus, which in both cases was found among cleaners. From my observation, investigation and interviews with cleaners I can infer that the work they are doing, they do really conscientiously and normally the health regulations are not violated. Further was found that the manipulation with laundry in Hospital Prachatice, a. s. is in accordance with the hygiene requirements for medical devices. What is important is the effective education of personnel in the prevention of infections and supervision of compliance of mandated procedures...|$|E
30|$|Before disinfection, {{the plant}} samples were {{thoroughly}} washed under running tap water for 10 h. The PG root samples were surface-disinfected with 70 % (v/v) ethanol for 1 min, 5 % NaOCl 10 min, 70 % (v/v) ethanol for 1 min and burning for 30 sec. The samples were subsequently rinsed with sterile water, {{and the outer}} tissue was removed with a sterile scalpel. Small pieces (0.5 × 0.5 cm) of PG were placed in Petri dishes containing malt extract agar (MEA, Difco, USA), Czapeck agar (CZA, Difco, USA), or potato dextrose agar (PDA, Difco, USA), and incubated at 28 °C for five days. Following <b>the</b> <b>incubation,</b> single <b>colonies</b> of distinctive morphotypes were separated {{on the basis of}} their morphological characteristics and appearance. <b>The</b> <b>colonies</b> were subsequently re-isolated by plating on PDA and incubated at 28 °C for 24 – 48 h to obtain pure cultures.

40|$|Summary: In this study, the {{isolation}} of C. sordellii from abomasum lesions of lambs and the confirmation of the isolates by polymerase chain reaction (PCR) was attempted. A total of 298 abomasal specimens (swabs) obtained from lambs of 4 to 8 months of age were investigated. Sampled swabs were inoculated onto blood agar plates and incubated anaerobically. Following <b>the</b> <b>incubation</b> grown <b>colonies</b> were identified according to their morphological and biochemical characteristics. C. sordellii was isolated from 17 of 298 specimens (5. 7 %). These bacteria were also confirmed to harbour C. sordellii DNA by PCR. In conclusion, the presence of C. sordellii in abomasum lesions was demonstrated in Turkey {{for the first time}} with this study...|$|R

40|$|Objective: To {{assess the}} value of the new {{differential}} culture medium CHROMagar Candida for routine investigation of clinical specimens. Methods: During a whole year, 6150 clinical samples were plated on CHROMagar Candida medium. After <b>incubation,</b> <b>the</b> green <b>colonies</b> were considered to be Candida albicans. <b>The</b> <b>colonies</b> of other colors were identified using Bichrolatex-krusei, or by their assimilation pattern on ID 32 C test strips and their morphology on rice cream-agar-Tween. Results: Among the 6150 clinical samples, 1643 were positive for fungi. Aspergillus fumigatus and Geotrichum sp. were the predominant filamentous fungi isolated. Candida albicans was the most common species isolated (1274 of the positive samples; 77. 5 %), and Candida glabrata was the second most common yeast isolated (174 positive samples; 10. 6 %). Other yeast species were detected at lower frequencies, mainly Candida tropicalis (3. 8 %), Candida krusei (2. 7 %), Saccharomyces cerevisiae (2. 7 %) and Candida kefyr (2. 3 %), and 16 samples revealed a lipophilic species, Malassezia furfur. Mixed fungal populations accounted for 14. 7 % of the positive samples. Two or more yeast species were detected in 206 of the 242 specimens containing mixed fungal populations, and five yeast species were detected in one sample. Additionally, we did not observe significant differences in the isolation of yeasts or filamentous fungi from the 366 samples simultaneously plated on CHROMagar Candida and Sabouraud dextrose agar. Close agreement between the two culture media was observed for 89. 9 % of these samples. Conclusions: CHROMagar Candida medium was shown to be extremely helpful in a routine clinical mycology service, facilitating the detection of mixed cultures of yeasts and allowing direct identification of C. albicans, as well as rapid presumptive identification of the other yeasts: C. glabrata, C. tropicalis, C. krusei and S. cerevisiae. This chromogenic medium thus appears to be suitable as a primary culture medium, particularly for the mycologic surveillance of immunocompromised patients...|$|R

40|$|Three {{different}} methods for detection and count of Streptococcus mutans in saliva have been {{compared with a}} microbiological method in order to estimate their efficacy and practicality. The study {{has been carried out}} on fifty children of six-eleven years old. The first method (stamp method) derives from that of Kohler and Bratthall, improved on the sampling, without saliva stimulation and, hence, more rapid. Furthermore, using a tongue depressor with a shovel-like extremity, we can either restrict the area where <b>the</b> grown <b>colonies</b> must be counted, avoiding any mistake, and stamp the spatula in the centre of the plate, not in the border, as the original method described, pressing it with the same force in every part, so that almost all the saliva collected can be plated on the Streptococcus mutans selective medium. As stated by this method, a tongue depressor is pressed first on the subject's tongue, then on a plate containing <b>the</b> medium. After <b>incubation,</b> <b>the</b> Streptococcus mutans <b>colonies</b> are counted on the plate's area limited by the stamp of the extremity of the spatula. According to Emilson we can also discriminate Streptococcus mutans and Streptococcus sobrinus <b>colonies.</b> <b>The</b> second method is a "strip mutans test" (Dentocult) : saliva is stimulated making the subject chew a piece of paraffin and then it is collected passing a plastic spatula for ten times on the child's tongue. The spatula is introduced into a tube containing a liquid medium selective for Streptococcus mutans and then incubated. (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 250 WORDS...|$|R

Fusarium wilt caused by F. oxysporum f. sp. canariensis was found on 54 Phoenix canariensis trees growing on four islands: Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura, La Palma and Tenerife. F. proliferatum occurred on fifteen palms (10 P. canariensis, 1 P. dactylifera, 3 Roystonea regia and 1 Veitchia joannis) located in Gran Canaria, Fuerteventura and Tenerife. Both these Fusarium species were found only in diseased palms from gardens and public parks, but not in natural palm groves.
