500|$|The Season Seven DVD {{contains}} {{a number of}} deleted scenes from this episode. Notable cut scenes include Andy discussing the [...] "crowd dynamic" [...] at musicals and music events, Gabe discussing his history of playing Ichabod Crane in three separate play productions, Pam and Jim discussing how hard <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> a babysitter, Michael ordering flowers, Andy getting a pep talk from his director, Phyllis worrying about Cynthia and Bob bonding, and Kevin talking to his sister {{who happens to be}} playing a part in the musical.|$|E
500|$|Producer John Lloyd, {{speaking}} to The Times in 1989 hinted {{that it was}} the draining scripting and rehearsal process that led to the writers deciding not to make another series: [...] "Things do get very tense by the end of a series, because everyone involved in the thing is very clever, and very funny, and they all want to push the scripts along. It's a very exhausting process, {{and by the end of}} it we all swear we'll never, ever, do another one. But then you start to think how rare <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> so many good people in the same room and you talk yourself into doing another series." ...|$|E
500|$|Critics near universally {{took issue}} with the game's controls. Critics found that the webs that they shot did not go where they wanted them to go, and {{multiple}} reviewers described navigation as [...] "trial and error". Reviewers also found {{that they could not}} always jump when they wanted to, and one reviewer found that power-ups failed to activate when she wanted them to. Reviewers also complained that it was extremely difficult to get enough stars to progress from one stage to the next, forcing players to replay the same levels over and over again. Because points are subtracted each time Spidy dies, the problems with the control scheme exacerbate how difficult <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> enough stars to progress.|$|E

500|$|The poor {{reception}} prompt Hadfield {{to release}} an apology to Minogue, blaming himself {{for not being}} {{in control of the}} promotion; [...] "I loved her voice, got on with her and I am embarrassed that I failed her." [...] Tom Parker, who wrote the liner notes for the 2003-release of Impossible Princess, had observed that critics slated [...] "Some Kind of Bliss" [...] due to Minogue's approach to [...] "obtain lyrical and production credibility, which was overshadowed in whole". Minogue publicly commented about the single's aftermath [...] "I think the static was that Elton had 75 percent of the sales that week, so mine didn't get off at a good start." [...] She went on to say [...] "I've told not to be frustrated, but I was frustrated because the album should be out [...] The point of <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it out and maybe people will like it, they may love it or they might hate it, but it was in my hands." [...] She also felt guilt for parting with Stock Aitken Waterman after her production team with Deconstruction was not in good terms; she later commented that she departed on [...] "good terms".|$|E
500|$|The CSI {{effect may}} alter how crimes are committed. In 2000, {{the year that}} CSI: Crime Scene Investigation debuted, 46.9 percent of all rape cases in the United States were {{resolved}} by police. By 2005, the rate had fallen to 41.3 percent. [...] Some investigators attributed this decline to the CSI effect, as crime shows often explain in detail how criminals can conceal or destroy evidence. Several rape victims have reported that their assailants forced them to shower or clean themselves with bleach after their assaults. In December 2005, Jermaine McKinney broke into a home in Trumbull County, Ohio, where he murdered two women. [...] A fan of CSI, McKinney went to unusual lengths to remove evidence of his crime: he cleaned his hands with bleach, burned the bodies and his clothing, and attempted {{to dispose of the}} murder weapon in a lake. McKinney was eventually apprehended. Ray Peavy, head of the Los Angeles County homicide division, commented that, in addition to teaching criminals how to conceal evidence, crime shows may even [...] "encourage them when they see how simple <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> away with [...] on television." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{correspondence}} between the two men, Hoffecker gave Rovelstad a number of tips {{about how to deal}} with Congress. [...] Even though the bill was still mired in committee, Hoffecker advised what to do once the bill was signed. [...] He did not know yet that Rovelstad was a sculptor, and wrote to him in September 1935 about the models to be submitted for approval, [...] "These should also be 10 [...] in diameter, and this is where your trouble commences. These sculptors all want to incorporate their own ideas in the design and ask anywhere from $400.00 to $1,000.00 for their work, telling you what trouble <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> the approval of the Commission of Fine Arts and many other things which do not exist." [...] Hoffecker also offered to handle the issue for the committee; he proposed to advance the money necessary to purchase the new coins from the government and to handle the distribution. [...] He stated that he had enjoyed the distribution of the Old Spanish Trail piece, though he lied to Rovelstad, stating he was not a coin dealer—the letterhead that Hoffecker used to write to Rovelstad said [...] "Loans and Mortgages" [...] under his name. He also warned Rovelstad, [...] "It would not be good for either of us if the word got out you had disposed of the entire issue to me." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{his review}} for The Boston Globe, John Freeman observes that Clarke's fantasy, {{like that of}} Franz Kafka and Neil Gaiman, is imbued with realism. He argues that the {{footnotes}} in particular lend an air of credibility to the narrative: for example, they describe a fictional biography of Jonathan Strange and list where particular paintings in Norrell’s house are located. In an interview, Clarke describes how she creates this realist fantasy: [...] "One way of grounding the magic is by putting in lots of stuff about street lamps, carriages and how difficult <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> good servants." [...] To create this effect, the novel includes many references to real early-nineteenth century people and things, such as: artists Francisco Goya, Cruikshank, and Rowlandson; writers Frances Burney, William Beckford, Monk Lewis, Lord Byron, and Ann Radcliffe; Maria Edgeworth's Belinda and Austen's Emma; publisher John Murray; politicians Lord Castlereagh and George Canning; The Gentleman's Magazine and The Edinburgh Review; Chippendale and Wedgwood furnishings; and the madness of King George III. Clarke has said that she hopes the magic is as realistic as that in Le Guin's Earthsea trilogy. This realism has led other reviewers, such as Polly Shulman, to argue that Clarke's book {{is more of an}} historical fiction, akin to the works of Patrick O'Brian. As she explains, [...] "Both Clarke's and O'Brian's stories are about a complicated relationship between two men bound together by their profession; both are set during the Napoleonic wars; and they share a dry, melancholy wit and unconventional narrative shape." [...] Shulman sees fantasy and historical fiction as similar because both must follow rigid rules or risk a breakdown of the narrative.|$|E

In January 2011, Gareth Edwards was announced as the director for the film. In an interview publicizing the DVD release of Monsters, Edwards discussed the new film: [...] "this will definitely {{have a very different}} feel than the 1998 film and our biggest concern is making sure we get it right for the fans because we know their concerns. It must be brilliant in every category because I'm a fan as well." [...] Edwards further stated, [...] "Without addressing anything specific, everyone knows how important <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>to</b> <b>get</b> it right." ...|$|E
