25|$|The Taizaong Shilu 3 March 1421 entry {{noted that}} the envoys of sixteen {{countries}} (Hormuz and other countries) were given gifts of paper and coin money, and ceremonial robes and linings before returning to their respective countries under escort of the treasure fleet. The imperial order for the sixth voyage was dated 3 March 1421.

5000|$|... "Evening {{snow on the}} [...] ") parodies River and Sky in Evening Snow ( [...] ). While kōten ( [...] , [...] "large {{river and}} sky") implies a {{composition}} in which a broad skyline lies against a wide river, the renderings in the Eight Views of Xiaoxiang tend to emphasize the snow-covered mountains. Harunobu replaces these mountains with , lacquered wooden forms that <b>silk</b> <b>floss</b> was placed on to dry. The young man at the top helps the young woman at the bottom prepare wadding from white <b>silk</b> <b>floss.</b> The print's embossing gives {{the feeling of the}} softness of the <b>silk</b> <b>floss</b> detail, a technique called karazuri (...) that uses an un-inked woodblock.|$|R

60|$|And two {{or three}} large palmers, red, grizzled, and coch-a-bonddhu, each with a tuft of red <b>floss</b> <b>silk</b> at the tail. These are enough to show sport from March to October; and also like enough to certain natural flies to satisfy the {{somewhat}} dull memory of a trout.|$|E
60|$|He dressed his thick, {{dark brown}} hair as best he could, drew {{on a pair of}} white stockings, and donned three lace shirts one over another. His fine cloak of <b>floss</b> <b>silk</b> he gave to Balbi, who looked for all the world as if he had stolen it.|$|E
6000|$|On {{coming in}} from a walk, Aurelia was {{surprised}} by the tidings that Mistress Phoebe Treforth had come to call on her, and had left a billet.

50|$|Silk comforters {{are easy}} to care for: they only need to be dried under the sun twice a year to {{maintain}} their freshness. If more thorough cleaning is required, a silk comforter should be dry-cleaned, since the <b>silk</b> <b>floss</b> layers are damaged by contact with water.|$|R
60|$|From Ulm! The very {{sound was}} joy; and Christina with {{trembling}} hands unfastened the cords and stitches that secured the canvas covering, within which lay folds on folds of linen, {{and in the}} midst a rich silver goblet, long ago brought by her father from Italy, a few of her own possessions, and a letter from her uncle secured with black <b>floss</b> <b>silk,</b> with a black seal.|$|E

"Often in our English mornings, the rain-clouds in {{the dawn}} form soft level fields, which melt imperceptibly into the blue; or when of less extent, gather into {{apparent}} bars, crossing the sheets of broader cloud above; {{and all these}} bathed throughout in an unspeakable light of pure rose-color, and purple, and amber, and blue, not shining, but misty-soft, the barred masses, when seen nearer, found to be woven in tresses of cloud, like <b>floss</b> <b>silk,</b> looking as if each knot were a little swathe or sheaf of lighted rain.|$|E
50|$|The {{extensive}} gardens feature ginkgo biloba, ombú, wisteria, cypress, palm, bitter orange, and <b>silk</b> <b>floss</b> trees, {{as well as}} buxus hedges totaling around 700 m (2,300 ft).

5000|$|Its main, Santiago del Estero {{campus was}} built in 1979, and the {{institution}} maintains campuses in San Salvador de Jujuy (1993), Olivos (1994), and Rafaela (1997).

60|$|Here {{the door}} opened, {{and a small}} quadroon boy, between four and five years of age, entered the room. There was {{something}} in his appearance remarkably beautiful and engaging. His black hair, fine as <b>floss</b> <b>silk,</b> hung in glossy curls about his round, dimpled face, while a pair of large dark eyes, full of fire and softness, looked out from beneath the rich, long lashes, as he peered curiously into the apartment. A gay robe of scarlet and yellow plaid, carefully made and neatly fitted, set off to advantage the dark and rich style of his beauty; and a certain comic air of assurance, blended with bashfulness, showed {{that he had been}} not unused to being petted and noticed by his master.|$|E
60|$|His tie {{is simple}} enough. A pale {{partridge}} or woodcock wing, short red hackle legs, a peacock-herl body, and a tail--on which too much artistic skill {{can hardly be}} expended--of yellow <b>floss</b> <b>silk,</b> and gold twist or tinsel. The orange-tailed governors 'of ye shops,' as the old drug-books would say, are all 'havers;' for the proper colour is a honey yellow. The mystery of this all-conquering tail seems to be, that it represents the yellow pollen, or 'bee bread' in the thighs or abdomen of the bee; whereof the bright colour, and perhaps the strong musky flavour, makes him an attractive and savoury morsel. Be that as it may, {{there is no better}} rule for a chalk stream than this--when you don't know what to fish with, try the governor.|$|E
60|$|The hamlet {{consisted}} of one large cottage {{and half a}} dozen small cots, besides several sheds and enclosures wherein were a few sleepy-looking sheep, some lean cattle, and several half-starved horses. There was active life there also. Smoke issued from the chimneys; fresh-looking women busied themselves about household work; rosy children tumbled in and out at the doors, while men in rough garments and with ruddy countenances mended nets or repaired boats on the shore. On a bench in front of the principal cottage sat a sturdy man, scarcely middle-aged, with shaggy fair and flowing locks. His right foot served as a horse to a rapturous little boy, whose locks and looks were so like to those of the man that their kinship was obvious--only the man was rugged and rough in exterior; the boy was round and smooth. Tow typified the hair of the man; <b>floss</b> <b>silk</b> that of the boy.|$|E
25|$|Dental floss {{is either}} a bundle of thin nylon {{filaments}} or a plastic ribbon used to remove food and dental plaque from teeth. Levi Spear Parmly, a dentist from New Orleans, is credited with inventing the first form of dental floss. He had been recommending that people should clean their teeth with <b>silk</b> <b>floss</b> since 1815.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>floss</b> is {{extracted}} from silkworm cocoons and spun by hand into yarn. It is then dyed with the kasuri technique using indigenous plant dyes and a mud mordant {{to give it}} its usual black-brown colouring; the plants used are the guru, techika, kurubo or Japanese persimmon, yamamomo, and yuna or cotton tree hibiscus. Finally it is woven with a takahata (高機) loom, and fulled by block.|$|R
50|$|<b>Silk</b> <b>floss</b> is {{extracted}} from silkworm cocoons and spun by hand into yarn. Patterns are added by tie-dyeing, before weaving with a loom {{known as a}} jibata (地機). The strap around the weaver's waist enables the tension of the vertical thread to be adjusted. It {{can take up to}} fifteen days to weave enough plain fabric for an adult garment, and up to forty-five days for patterned fabric.|$|R
60|$|Having made {{a bundle}} of the fine taffeta suit {{in which he had}} been arrested, his gay cloak of <b>floss</b> <b>silk,</b> some stockings, shirts, and handkerchiefs, he and Balbi passed up to the other cell, {{compelling}} Soradici to go with them. Leaving the monk to make a parcel of his belongings, Casanova went to tackle the roof. By dusk he had made a hole twice as large as was necessary, and had laid bare the lead sheeting with which the roof was covered. Unable, single-handed, to raise one of the sheets, he called Balbi to his aid, and between them, assisted by the spontoon, which Casanova inserted between the edge of the sheet and the gutter, they at last succeeded in tearing away the rivets. Then by putting their shoulders to the lead they bent it upwards until there was room to emerge, and a view of the sky flooded by the vivid light of the crescent moon.|$|E
60|$|This simple yet {{first-class}} conversation {{existed in}} the morning-room of Plusham, where the mistress of the palatial mansion sat involved in the sacred privacy of a circle of her married daughters. One dexterously applied golden knitting-needles to the fabrication of a purse of <b>floss</b> <b>silk</b> of the rarest texture, which none who knew the almost fabulous wealth of the Duke would believe was ever destined to hold in its silken meshes a less sum than 1,000,000 pounds; another adorned a slipper exclusively with seed pearls; a third emblazoned a page with rare pigments and the finest quality of gold leaf. Beautiful forms leaned over frames glowing with embroidery, and beautiful frames leaned over forms inlaid with mother-of-pearl. Others, more remote, occasionally burst into melody as they tried the passages {{of a new and}} exclusive air given to them in MS. by some titled and devoted friend, for the private use of the aristocracy alone, and absolutely prohibited for publication.|$|E
60|$|In {{personal}} appearance Ethelbert Stanhope {{was the most}} singular of beings. He was certainly very handsome. He had his sister Madeline's eyes, without their stare and without their hard, cunning, cruel firmness. They were also very much lighter, and of so light and clear a blue as to make his face remarkable, if nothing else did so. On entering a room with him, Ethelbert's blue eyes {{would be the first}} thing you would see, and on leaving it almost the last you would forget. His light hair was very long and silky, coming down over his coat. His beard had been prepared in holy land, and was patriarchal. He never shaved and rarely trimmed it. It was glossy, soft, clean, and altogether not unprepossessing. It was such that ladies might desire to reel it off and work it into their patterns in lieu of <b>floss</b> <b>silk.</b> His complexion was fair and almost pink; he was small in height and slender in limb, but well-made; and his voice was of peculiar sweetness.|$|E
5000|$|The Banni or Heer Bharat {{embroidery}} {{originates in}} Gujarat, and is practiced mainly by the Lohana community. It {{is done with}} <b>silk</b> <b>floss</b> (Heer means [...] "silk floss") and it {{is famous for its}} vibrancy and richness in color pallets & design patterns, which include shisha (mirror) work. Bagh and phulkari embroidery of the Punjab region has influenced Heer Bharat embroidery in its use of geometrical motifs and stitchery.|$|R
5000|$|The cocoons {{are first}} boiled {{to loosen the}} sericin holding the {{filaments}} together and remove the silkworm. Each cocoon is stretched by hand on a U-shaped wooden rack, and the ball of thread becomes a sheet of tangled fibers. This sheet is then hand-stretched again on a larger rack, along with several other cocoons to make a thick, cottony bundle called <b>silk</b> <b>floss.</b> It takes hundreds of these bundles to make a silk comforter.|$|R
50|$|The <b>silk</b> <b>floss</b> tree is {{cultivated}} {{mostly for}} ornamental purposes. Outside of private gardens around the world, {{it is often}} planted along urban streets in subtropical areas such as in South Africa, Australia, northern New Zealand and the southern USA, although its prickled trunks and limbs require safety buffer zones, especially around the trunks, {{in order to protect}} people and domesticated animals from its prickles. Ceiba speciosa is added to some versions of the hallucinogenic drink Ayahuasca.|$|R
60|$|Ameera {{climbed the}} narrow {{staircase}} {{that led to}} the flat roof. The child, placid and unwinking, lay in the hollow of her right arm, gorgeous in silver-fringed muslin with a small skull-cap on his head. Ameera wore all that she valued most. The diamond nose-stud that takes the place of the Western patch in drawing attention to the curve of the nostril, the gold ornament in the centre of the forehead studded with tallow-drop emeralds and flawed rubies, the heavy circlet of beaten gold that was fastened round her neck by the softness of the pure metal, and the chinking curb-patterned silver anklets hanging low over the rosy ankle-bone. She was dressed in jade-green muslin as befitted a daughter of the Faith, and from shoulder to elbow and elbow to wrist ran bracelets of silver tied with <b>floss</b> <b>silk,</b> frail glass bangles slipped over the wrist in proof of the slenderness of the hand, and certain heavy gold bracelets that had no part in her country's ornaments but, since they were Holden's gift and fastened with a cunning European snap, delighted her immensely.|$|E
6000|$|However, {{she then}} turned her {{attention}} to the accounts, where Sir Andrew Melville was ready to question and debate every item set down by Shrewsbury's steward; while his mistress showed herself liberal and open-handed. Indeed she had considerable command of money from her French dowry, the proceeds of which were, in spite of the troubles of the League, regularly paid to her, and no doubt served her well in maintaining the correspondence which, throughout her captivity, eluded the vigilance of her keepers. On taking leave of her, which Richard Talbot did before joining his host at the mid-day meal, she reiterated her thanks for his care of her daughter, and her charges to let no persuasion induce him to consent to Babington's overtures, adding that she hoped soon to obtain permission to have the maiden amongst her authorised attendants. She gave him a billet, loosely tied with black <b>floss</b> <b>silk</b> and unsealed, so that if needful, Sadler and Shrewsbury might both inspect the tender, playful, messages she wrote to her [...] "mignonne," [...] and which she took care should not outrun those which she had often addressed to Bessie Pierrepoint.|$|E
60|$|Hum {{had his own}} {{favourite}} {{places and}} perches. From the first day he chose for his nightly roost a towel-line which had been drawn across the corner over the wash-stand, where he every night established himself with one claw in {{the edge of the}} towel and the other clasping the line, and, ruffling up his feathers till he looked like a little chestnut-burr, he would resign himself to the soundest sleep. He did not tuck his head under his wing, but seemed to sink it down between his shoulders, with his bill almost straight up in the air. One evening one of us, going to use the towel, jarred the line, and soon after found that Hum had been thrown from his perch, and was hanging head downward, fast asleep, still clinging to the line. Another evening, being discomposed by somebody coming to the towel-line after he had settled himself, he fluttered off; but so sleepy that he had not discretion to poise himself again, and was found clinging, like a little bunch of green <b>floss</b> <b>silk,</b> to the mosquito netting of the window.|$|E
50|$|Silk {{comes from}} the cocoons of the silkworm, which feeds off {{mulberry}} trees in subtropical climates. When the cocoon is boiled, the hard cocoon becomes a loose ball of strong, flexible filament measuring over 1,000 meters. Usually, this ball is uncoiled and wrapped on a spindle {{for use in the}} textile industry. Silk is used for making everything from clothing to rugs. During silk comforter production, however, the silk filament is not unraveled, but rather stretched into a flat tangled web and layered to form <b>silk</b> <b>floss,</b> which will fill the comforter.|$|R
50|$|This mill, {{probably}} flour, is attested in the 18th century. It initially {{belongs to}} the Manoël d'Ayres family whose castle is 700 meters south. In the cadastre of 1841, it is mentioned as a fulling mill owned by Louis Pagett. In 1849 it is transformed into carding of <b>silk</b> <b>floss,</b> then gradually converted into wool carding. The spinning is managed by Benjamin Avesque, who goes bankrupt in 1855, then by David Saumade. His son sells the buildings in 1892 to Louis Couderc who operates the carding wool until 1926.|$|R
5000|$|Artifacts {{date from}} the 18th century to the present day, and include dental {{equipment}} such as articulators, denture-forming equipment, and dental X-ray items, as well as historical oral hygiene items, which include a toothpaste and tooth powder collection on loan. Among the exhibits are materials on Saint Apollonia, {{the patron saint of}} dentistry; a collection of dentistry-themed children's books and toys; and materials on the noted dentist Willoughby D. Miller, a graduate of the university. The museum's collection includes [...] "toothbrushes with heads greater than two inches in length, <b>floss</b> made from <b>silk</b> and examination chairs grand enough for a king." ...|$|R
