Therefore {{it is necessary that}} these grains are properly dried and stored to ensure availability and wholesomeness throughout the year. Advancements have taken place in the practice of drying since the first world war. Manufacturing methods have greatly improved production rate and the production line bottle-neck created by extended drying time inherent in the use old drying methods can no longer be tolerated. Main objectives of this study were to improve on the design of an existing cabinet grain dryer (to redesign the already existing cabinet grain dryer so as to: (i) Optimize efficiency at low cost (ii) Reduce total time of drying (iii) Produce viable and quality grain. Approach: The improvement on the design of the existing cabinet dryer had been achieved through proper focus on the selection of power source, materials and other design criteria for the various components of the existing one. The dryer consists of a cabinet containing trays in which the grains to be dried are spread.

The dryer also consisted of a thermostat which turns off the machine if inlet temperature exceeds 40 °C. Results: The result of the improvement on the design of a cabinet grain dryer showed that; (i) It was less costly (ii) It was cheap to maintain since the fan is the only moving component and can hardly become faulty (iii) drying time of the grain was reduced (iv) The machine ergonomic; operation of the machine does not require specialization (v) The machine is safer to operate since the use of gas has been eliminated (vi) Time between two batches was reduced with the introduction of a trolley (vii) Energy for loading or unloading reduced since the trays can be loaded and unloaded outside the cabinet. Conclusion: Drying of grains safer since fire hazards were reduced owing to the use of gas in the previous design. Heater supplied the right quantity of heat and incorporates a fan which supplies right quantity of air needed to distribute this heat evenly to all grains in drying chamber. This made drying faster and grains are moderately dried...|$|E

50|$|Durham Hosiery Mill is a {{historic}} textile mill complex located at Durham, Durham County, North Carolina. It includes seven contributing brick buildings in the complex. The original Durham Hosiery Mill was built in 1902, and consists of a four-story main building with a six-story Romanesque Revival style tower in front; engine, boiler, and <b>heater</b> <b>houses</b> attached at the rear, and a one-story dye house. The main building was expanded with a two-story annex in 1904, and a three-story annex in 1906. Other buildings include the triangular Annex No. 1 (1912) and a three-story brick finishing building. By 1910, the Durham Hosiery Mills Corporation was the largest manufacturer of cotton hosiery in the world. The mill was abandoned in 1922.|$|R

It was built in 1883, and is a large three-story, five bay, brick dwelling with Eastlake and Queen Anne design elements. The front facade features a two-story portico with four full-height Tuscan columns, added about 1942. Also on the property are the contributing large bank barn with cupola and weathervane, a scale house dating at least to 1907, a frame summer kitchen, a two level stone ice house, a smokehouse, and a brick bake oven. It was owned by Solomon and Caroline Wunder Heater, who lost two sons fighting for the Confederacy, {{even though she was}} a staunch Union sympathizer.|$|R
40|$|Mine {{ventilation}} systems provide air to underground mines through large fan systems {{and a series}} of raises and tunnels. Doors and barricades are put in to direct the flow of fresh air to the places it is needed in a mine. At present, the solution to meeting TLV’s limits has been to increase the volume of air entering the mine to dilute it appropriately. As the pressure to improve the underground environment has been mounting the idea of magnetizing fuels for providing more complete combustion has been a potential solution that needed a fresh look. Demystifying magnetization and how it works to provide more complete combustion has been the major stumbling block to understanding the value of this idea. This paper describes two experiments that were done {{over the last two years}} to improve our understanding of how magnetization can make a potential difference. The first experiment involved testing a diesel engine in a controlled environment without and with magnets. The results while not totally conclusive did indicate something significant was happening. Due to these results a different experiment needed to be done on a larger scale. It was decided that a larger quantity of fuel being combusted continuously would speed getting results. Therefore, a <b>heater</b> <b>house</b> used for winter heating of mine ventilation air was selected. The results of magnetizing natural gas headers in a <b>heater</b> <b>house</b> were substantial. Over a two-year test period, a total of 11. 95 % less gas was used to heat the mine air. This paper will provide background for the reader into fuel magnetization theory, the initial diesel combustion experiment, the McCreedy East mine experience and then discuss the potential of this exciting new technology and future work that will be undertaken...|$|R

50|$|The Vixen was {{designed}} as {{an answer to the}} GMC motorhome. The Vixen {{was designed}} to be stored in a typical garage as it was only 6 feet high and 21 feet long. Despite its small size by motorhome standards, the Vixen was marketed as having all of the features of larger competitors. Such features included a generator and water <b>heater.</b> Two <b>house</b> batteries {{and one of the first}} electric inverters in an RV allowed the owner to run the microwave, air-conditioning, and anything else which could be plugged into 110-volt outlets, off the batteries that were charged by the 120-amp alternator. The Vixen could also be plugged-in at a typical campsite outlet. Water came from the fresh water tank or services at a campsite and was heated by a heat exchanger. The same engine heat was used to warm the passenger compartment. Since diesels do not develop waste heat quickly, there was also an auxiliary diesel heater that could raise the temperature of the engine coolant. This helped with winter starting, keeping the RV warm, and the water hot. The heater was fuel efficient, and didn't need to stop for propane to fuel it. Unfortunately, it was notorious for needing service.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{presents}} {{the evaluation of}} a miniature liquid microflow sensor, directly integrated on a PCB. The sensor operation {{is based on the}} convective heat transfer principle. The heating and sensing elements are thin Pt resistors which are in direct electrical contact with the external copper tracks of the printed circuit board. Due to the low thermal conductivity of the substrate material, a high degree of thermal isolation is obtained which improves the operating characteristics of the device. The sensor is able to operate under both the hot-wire and the calorimetric principle. In order to fully exploit the temperature distribution in the flowing liquid, multiple sensing elements are positioned in various distances from the <b>heater.</b> A special <b>housing</b> was developed which allowed implementation of the sensor into tubes of various cross sectional areas. The sensor sensitivity and measurement range {{as a function of the}} sensing element distance were quantified.

40|$|BackgroundCarbon {{monoxide}} (CO) is {{an important}} source of poisoning in children. We performed this study in order to clarify the clinical characteristics of pediatric patients with CO poisoning. MethodsWe identified and reviewed the medical records of pediatric patients diagnosed with CO intoxication and hospitalized in our department during a 10 -year period. Epidemiologic and clinical data were collected and analyzed. ResultsA total of 30 children with CO poisoning were identified. Their ages ranged from 2 to 17 years, with a mean of 9. 5 ± 4. 5 years. Improperly vented exhaust produced by gas hot water heaters was {{the most common cause of}} intoxication (53. 3 %), followed by house fires (26. 7 %). Intentional poisoning by charcoal burning by parents occurred in six patients (20. 0 %). The majority of events occurred during cool seasons (76. 7 %). The most common presenting symptom was consciousness disturbance (86. 7 %). Only one child died and the mortality was 0. 03 %. Five (16. 7 %) children developed delayed neurologic sequelae (DNS), but they all recovered completely within 2 months. Seizures during the acute stage, severe metabolic acidosis, significant hypotension, longer times for recovery to full consciousness, and longer hospital stays were observed in children with DNS. ConclusionChildren with CO poisoning had good outcomes in this series. Although improperly vented exhaust from water <b>heaters</b> and <b>house</b> fires were the most common causes, intentional poisoning by parents through charcoal burning was also an important factor.

40|$|PURPOSE: This study {{investigated}} whether the Clean Development Mechanism (CDM) could {{assist with the}} funding of low-pressure solar water <b>heaters</b> in low-cost <b>housing</b> in South Africa. It aimed to identify the minimum requirements for the CDM to succesfully act as a funding mechanism. METHODOLOGY: In this mixed-method study, qualitative methods, including a literature review, interview and case study, were used to inform the quantitative {{part of the study}} by identifying the key variables that had to be considered in developing a financial model that allowed the identification of the parameters that would make the CDM a viable funding mechanism. FINDINGS: It was found that the Clean Development Mechanism by itself cannot fund the installation of 110 l LP-SWH in low-cost housing in South Africa. For a CDM programme to be financially viable the CER prices should be at levels above R 80 each and the price per LP-SWH should be less than R 3 388. LIMITATIONS: In determining the feasibility parameters the study only considered two variables: the CER price and the capital costs of a LP-SWH unit. VALUE OF THE PAPER: The paper offers policy makers and financial institutions an indication of the feasibility of the CDM as a financing mechanism for LP-SWH in low-income housing. [URL]...|$|R
