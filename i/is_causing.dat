5|$|Complicated UTIs {{are more}} {{difficult}} to treat and usually requires more aggressive evaluation, treatment and follow-up. It may require identifying and addressing the underlying complication. Increasing antibiotic resistance <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> concern about the future of treating those with complicated and recurrent UTI.|$|E
5|$|Data {{is visiting}} D'Sora, but she seems unhappy {{and he is}} acting erratically {{in order to find}} an {{appropriate}} response to make her happy. It becomes evident to the crew that the nebula <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> distortions in space; Picard orders the ship into warp to leave the nebula as quickly as possible but this speeds up the distortions. Whilst investigating them, Lieutenant Van Mayter (Georgina Shore) is killed when a distortion embeds her into the deck. Data discovers that dark matter <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> the distortions. The ship can detect the pockets at short range, but not in enough time {{to move out of the}} way. Worf proposes using a shuttle to lead the Enterprise out, and Picard insists on piloting it alone.|$|E
5|$|As well as {{producing}} electricity, the dam {{is intended}} to increase the Yangtze River's shipping capacity and reduce the potential for floods downstream by providing flood storage space. China regards the project as monumental {{as well as a}} success socially and economically, with the design of state-of-the-art large turbines, and a move toward limiting greenhouse gas emissions. However, the dam flooded archaeological and cultural sites and displaced some 1.3million people, and <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> significant ecological changes, including an increased risk of landslides. The dam has been controversial both domestically and abroad.|$|E

Murine Typhus <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by the Rickettsia Typhi bacteria, from the fleas on rats. Scrub Typhus <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by the Orientia Tsutsugamushi bacteria, from the harvest mites on humans and rodents. Queensland tick typhus <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by the Rickettsia Australis bacteria, from ticks.|$|R
40|$|Ehrlichiosis is a {{group of}} diseases, usually named {{according}} to the host species and the type of white blood cell most often infected. Canine monocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Ehrlichia canis and, occasionally, E. chaffeensis. Canine granulocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Anaplasma phagocytophilum and Ehrlichia ewingii. Equine monocytic ehrlichiosis/Potomac horse fever <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Neorickettsia risticii (formerly Ehrlichia risticii). Equine granulocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Tick-borne fever, a disease of ruminants, <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Human monocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Ehrlichia chaffeensis and E. ewingii. Human granulocytic ehrlichiosis <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Anaplasma phagocytophilum. Sennetsu fever <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by Neorickettsia sennetsu (formerly Ehrlichia sennetsu). In 2001, the taxonomy of the ehrlichiae was changed. Formerly, they belonged to the genus Ehrlichia, tribe Ehrlichieae and family Rickettsiaceae. Some species of Ehrlichia have now been reclassified into the genera Anaplasma or Neorickettsia, and all were placed in the family Anaplasmataceae. Anaplasma phagocytophilum contain...|$|R
50|$|So far one agent {{has been}} identified, the ciliate {{protozoan}} Halofolliculina corallasia. Skeletal eroding band {{is the first}} recorded disease of corals that <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by a protozoan, and thus the first known to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by an eukaryote - most <b>are</b> <b>caused</b> by prokaryotic bacteria. For example, black band disease <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by microbial mats of variable composition, and White pox disease by the bacterium Serratia marcescens.|$|R
5|$|Discectomy (the partial {{removal of}} a disc that <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> leg pain) can provide pain relief sooner than nonsurgical treatments. Discectomy has better {{outcomes}} at one year but not at four to ten years. The less invasive microdiscectomy has not been shown {{to result in a}} different outcome than regular discectomy. For most other conditions, there is not enough evidence to provide recommendations for surgical options. The long-term effect surgery has on degenerative disc disease is not clear. Less invasive surgical options have improved recovery times, but evidence regarding effectiveness is insufficient.|$|E
5|$|Earth's {{magnetic}} field stops its atmosphere from being stripped {{away by the}} solar wind. Venus and Mars do not have {{magnetic field}}s, {{and as a result}} the solar wind <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> their atmospheres to gradually bleed away into space. Coronal mass ejections and similar events blow a magnetic field and huge quantities of material {{from the surface of the}} Sun. The interaction of this magnetic field and material with Earth's magnetic field funnels charged particles into Earth's upper atmosphere, where its interactions create aurorae seen near the magnetic poles.|$|E
5|$|Evidence {{suggests}} that barotrauma <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> bat fatalities around wind turbines. Bats have typical mammalian lungs, which {{are thought to}} be more sensitive to sudden air pressure changes than the lungs of birds, making them more liable to fatal rupture. In addition, {{it has been suggested that}} bats are attracted to these structures, perhaps seeking roosts, and thereby increasing the death rate. Acoustic deterrents may help to reduce bat mortality at wind farms.|$|E

Cholera <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by a frightful pain in the stomach, and diphtheria <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by trying to cure a sore throat.|$|R
5|$|For {{functioning}} tumors, the somatostatin analog {{class of}} medications, such as octreotide, {{can reduce the}} excessive production of hormones. Lanreotide can slow tumor growth. If the tumor is not amenable to surgical removal and <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> symptoms, targeted therapy with everolimus or sunitinib can reduce symptoms and slow progression of the disease. Standard cytotoxic chemotherapy is generally not very effective for PanNETs, but may be used when other drug treatments fail to prevent the disease from progressing, or in poorly differentiated PanNET cancers.|$|E
5|$|Increasing ozone {{pollution}} <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> tissue {{damage to the}} massive giant sequoia trees in the park, making them more vulnerable to insect infestation and disease. Since the cones of these trees require fire-touched soil to germinate, historic fire suppression has reduced these trees' ability to reproduce. The current policy of setting prescribed fires is expected to help the germination issue.|$|E
5|$|On December 9, 2010, Symantec {{released}} the 18.5 version through Norton LiveUpdate. However, this update was later pulled due to numerous {{reports on the}} Norton forums that the update <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> system instability and freeze ups during system scans (both full and quick scans). This issue only affects some customers. Users affected by this update are advised to uninstall the product, run the Norton Removal Tool, and reinstall the 18.1 version from http://www.norton.com/nis11. Symantec later fixed the bugs and re-{{released the}} update.|$|E
5000|$|There {{are three}} types of CFEOM, {{numbered}} 1-3. CFEOM1, the most common type, is now known to <b>be</b> <b>caused</b> by one of several mutations in the KIF21A gene, while CFEOM2 <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by mutations in the PHOX2A gene. CFEOM3 <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> by mutations in the TUBB3 gene.|$|R

5|$|Set {{within a}} fictionalized {{version of the}} San Francisco Bay Area, {{the game is played}} from a third-person {{perspective}} and its open world is navigated on-foot or by vehicle. Players control Marcus Holloway, a hacker who works with the hacking group DedSec to take down the city's advanced surveillance system known as ctOS. There are multiple ways to complete missions, and each successful assignment increases the follower count of DedSec. Cooperative multiplayer allows for competitive one-on-one combat and connecting with other players in order to neutralize a player who <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> havoc.|$|E
5|$|Surgery may {{be useful}} in those with a herniated disc that <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> {{significant}} pain radiating into the leg, significant leg weakness, bladder problems, or loss of bowel control. It may also be useful in those with spinal stenosis. In the absence of these issues, there is no clear evidence of a benefit from surgery.|$|E

50|$|In {{the world}} {{we can see that}} things <b>are</b> <b>caused.</b> But it <b>is</b> not {{possible}} for something to <b>be</b> the <b>cause</b> of itself, because this would entail that it exists prior to itself, which is a contradiction. If that by which it <b>is</b> <b>caused</b> <b>is</b> itself <b>caused,</b> then it too must have a cause. But this cannot be an infinitely long chain, so therefore there must <b>be</b> a <b>cause</b> which <b>is</b> not itself <b>caused</b> by anything further. This everyone understands to be God.|$|R

5|$|The {{mechanisms}} of CCD are still unknown, but many causes {{are currently being}} considered, such as pesticides, mites, fungi, beekeeping practices (such {{as the use of}} antibiotics or long-distance transportation of beehives), malnutrition, poor quality queens, starvation, other pathogens, and immunodeficiencies. The current scientific consensus is that no single factor <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> CCD, but that some of these factors in combination may lead to CCD either additively or synergistically.|$|E
5|$|The second main plot thread follows Egwene al'Vere, {{leader of}} the rebel faction of Aes Sedai. After her capture by the White Tower in the {{previous}} book, Egwene works to undermine Elaida a'Roihan's rule and mend the strife it <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> in the White Tower. She is initially granted freedom of the tower as novice, but after publicly denouncing Elaida, Elaida names her a follower of the Dark One, and orders her imprisonment. When Elaida fails to prove her accusation, Egwene is released.|$|E
5|$|The {{symptoms}} of narcosis {{may be caused}} by other factors during a dive: ear problems causing disorientation or nausea; early signs of oxygen toxicity causing visual disturbances; or hypothermia causing rapid breathing and shivering. Nevertheless, the presence of any of these symptoms should imply narcosis. Alleviation of the effects upon ascending to a shallower depth will confirm the diagnosis. Given the setting, other likely conditions do not produce reversible effects. In the rare event of misdiagnosis when another condition <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> the symptoms, the initial management– ascending closer to the surface– is still essential.|$|E

5|$|After hearing {{news that}} Syed {{is trying to}} find his wife Amira Shah (Preeya Kalidas), Yusef visits her father, Qadim (Ramon Tikaram) at his office and offers to avenge his family for causing Amira pain. When Zainab and Yusef attend an event together, people assume they are married and Zainab does not correct them. Afterwards, Yusef admits to Zainab that he has great {{feelings}} for her but they should maintain some distance as she is married. Yusef continues to manipulate Zainab and ply her with pills, but she says she wishes to stop taking them, so Yusef crushes up a bottle of pills and conceals them in Zainab's food. Zainab passes out and is hospitalised, with her family believing she took a deliberate overdose, as was Yusef's plan. Concerned that he himself <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> Zainab's worries, Masood divorces Zainab by saying the triple talaq.|$|E
5|$|Cholangitis {{requires}} {{admission to}} hospital. Intravenous fluids are administered, {{especially if the}} blood pressure is low, and antibiotics are commenced. Empirical treatment with broad-spectrum antibiotics is usually necessary until it is known for certain which pathogen <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> the infection, and to which antibiotics it is sensitive. Combinations of penicillins and aminoglycosides are widely used, although ciprofloxacin {{has been shown to}} be effective in most cases, and may be preferred to aminoglycosides because of fewer side effects. Metronidazole is often added to specifically treat the anaerobic pathogens, especially in those who are very ill or at risk of anaerobic infections. Antibiotics are continued for 7–10days. Drugs that increase the blood pressure (vasopressors) may also be required to counter the low blood pressure.|$|E
5|$|It is {{not clear}} what happens to the Rocket Group {{immediately}} after this: the next time Quatermass is seen on screen (Quatermass, also released internationally as The Quatermass Conclusion and Quatermass IV, 1979) he has long been retired, living in retreat in the Scottish Highlands. He has recently become the guardian of his teenaged granddaughter Hettie after her parents were killed in a road accident in Germany. After Hettie runs away from home, he travels to London in search of her and finds a dystopian world there. Quatermass and the scientist Joe Kapp establish that an alien probe <b>is</b> <b>causing</b> the collapse of society by feeding on the world's youth, and Quatermass forms a plan to drive the intruder away by the detonation of a nuclear bomb. He presses the button to detonate it himself, with Hettie's help, and they are killed in the blast as the planet is saved.|$|E
