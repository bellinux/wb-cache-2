The Carbonari secretly continued their agitation against Austria and the governments in <b>friendly</b> <b>connection</b> with it. They formed a vendita. Pope Pius VII issued a general condemnation of the secret society of the Carbonari. The association lost its influence by degrees and was gradually absorbed into the new political organizations that sprang up in Italy; its members became affiliated especially with Mazzini's [...] "Young Italy". From Italy the organization was carried to France where it appeared as the Charbonnerie, which, was divided into ventes. Members were especially numerous in Paris.

From Paris the movement spread rapidly through the country, and it was the cause of several mutinies among the troops; it lost its importance after several conspirators were executed, especially as quarrels broke out among the leaders.

40|$|The major militant Islamist {{network in}} Indonesia, {{comprising}} the Jemaah Islamiyah (JI) {{and its associated}} groups, was {{believed to have been}} responsible for dozens of violent incidents after 2000, including the Bali bombings of 2002 and 2005. Generally JI sympathized with al-Qaeda's ideology, openly supported al-Qaeda and other militant ideologues by translating and publishing their work in Indonesia, and sent hundreds of fighters (mujahidin) to Afghanistan for training. The Indonesian militant Islamist groups were not foreign controlled, but they shared some features with a broader militant Islamist network. This essay takes as its point of departure Albert-Laszlo Barabasi's characterization of al-Qaeda as a matrix of self-organized networks, not a military organization with structured divisions. In Barabasi's theorization of networks, al-Qaeda appears as a "scale-free network" of a limited number of persons who had accumulated many nodes in a scattered and self-sustaining web. Hence, JI was loosely organized and yet hierarchical, composed of small cells held together by personal loyalties, family, school, and other <b>friendly</b> <b>connections.</b> Faced with intensifying police assaults, militant Islamists increasingly fell back on their networks. Using published reports and the author's own interviews with relevant individuals, this essay traces the links and nodes of the militant Islamic networks in Indonesia and examines why and how jihadists in Indonesia tenaciously sustained their violent activities...|$|R

Recent focus to redevelop these open lots and increase density/activity in the city’s core have been hugely successful as many of these lots are today being turned into large residential, retail and commercial developments. This is especially true around the newly redeveloped and highly popular Union Station area in Denver’s LoDo (Lower Downtown) neighborhood.

40|$|A {{physical}} separation method (i. e. sieving) was investigated to determine {{particle size distribution}} in non-radioactive sludge slurry simulants {{with the goal of}} implementation into the SRNL (Savannah River National Laboratory) shielded cells for use with radioactive sludge slurries. The investigation included obtaining the necessary experimental equipment, developing accessory equipment for use with the sieve shaker (to be able to sieve simulant slurries with aqueous solutions), sieving three different simulant slurries through a number of sieves and determining the particle size distribution gravimetrically, and developing a sufficient cleaning protocol of the sieves for re-use. The experimental protocol involved successive sieving of a NIST standard (to check the particle size retention of the sieves) and three non-radioactive slurry simulants (Batch 3 Tank 40 Test 3, Tank 40 Drum 3 and CETL Sludge Batch 2, which had been previously characterized by Microtrac analysis) through smaller and smaller sieves (150 microns x 5 microns) via use of the wet sieving system or by hand. For each of the three slurries, duplicate experiments were carried out using filtered supernate and DI water (to check the accuracy of the method versus Microtrac data) to sieve the slurry. Particle size determinations using the wet sieving system with DI water agree well with Microtrac data on a volume basis and in some cases the sieving data may be more accurate particularly if the material sieved had large particles. A correction factor had to be applied to data obtained from experiments done with supernate due to the dissolved solids which dried upon the sieves in the drying stage of the experiments. Upon subtraction of the correction factors, the experimental results were very similar to those obtained with DI water. It should be noted that approximately 250 mL of each of three simulant slurries was necessary to have enough filtered supernate available to carry out the experiments. The experimental results for the slurries are below with Microtrac data. The design of the experimental equipment was sufficient initially, but some pieces of the equipment began failing over time due to the caustic nature of the supernate and the vibrations from the sieve shaker. It is therefore recommended that upgrades to the experimental equipment be done before implementation into the SRNL shielded cells. Theses upgrades include using manipulator <b>friendly</b> <b>connections,</b> changing brass parts for stainless steel parts, using Teflon rather than polycarbonate, and possibly a change of pumps used to re-circulate the sieving fluid...|$|R

The life and political journey of Budislav Budisavljević-Prijedorski is roughly divided into two parts in the paper. The first part covers his youth, when the young Budisavljević as pupil of Kurelac and tough populist with his own literary work and <b>friendly</b> <b>connections</b> with Croatian writers supported their political and cultural work, and involved himself in politics, he began working on raising awareness {{of the people and}} the improvement of their economic opportunities, confronting the invading Germanism and Hungarianism. The second part covers the period of his life when Budisavljević left his career as a Krajina administrative officer and as a young deputy governor in Syrmia, and later as a chief governor under the Khuen regime in three Croatian counties (Bjelovar-Križevci, Lika-Krbava and Zagreb) he moved {{within the framework of the}} official Hungarian regime in the then Triune Kingdom as a typical "Khuenian". His concerns for national definition in the memoirs are clearly illustrated in the first part of his life, later he accepted Serbian national feeling, since the Yugoslavian ideology was the closest, which he clearly embraced in the older days. The memoirs of Budislav Budisavljević pl. Prijedorski Croatian and Serbian politician and writer are autobiographical annals in which Budisavljevi! apart from descriptions of the political situations dealt with contemporary accounts, and other various events from many towns in Croatia and Slavonia where he served. At the beginning the memoirs describe his adolescence and adulthood, then the historical events in which he mainly served as a deputy or chief governor.

Ultimately it can be concluded that Budisavljević 2 ̆ 7 s memoirs are non-critical of his actions, but despite this subjective view his memoirs are an important contribution tot he understanding of 19 th century Croatian history, especially on local levels, mostly in areas of the once Lika-Krbava County...|$|R

40|$|Most {{studies of}} disease {{spreading}} consider the underlying social network as obtained without the contagion, though epidemic influences people's willingness to contact others: A "friendly" contact may be turned to "unfriendly" to avoid infection.

In a signed network, according to Heider's theory, edge signs evolve such that finally a state of structural balance is achieved, corresponding to no frustration in physics terms. However, the danger of infection affects the evolution of its edge signs. To describe the coupled problem of the sign evolution and disease spreading, we generalize the notion of structural balance by taking into account the state of the nodes.
