5|$|The lens {{features}} a hypersonic zoom motor for its autofocus, {{which is considered}} to be a fast and quiet design. In addition, manual override is allowed in the single-shot autofocus mode. The lens, which focuses internally, has one of the lowest maximum magnification measurements in its class (which includes the Canon 10–18mm and 10–22mm, Sigma 10–20mm f/3.5 and Sigma 10–20mm f/4–5.6 EX DC HSM, Tamron 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5 DI II, Nikon 10–24mm f/3.5–4.5G ED AF-S DX, and Tokina 11–16mm f/2.8 AT-X Pro DX lenses). The lens' autofocus feature is not functional with Pentax ist* series and K100D DSLR cameras that do not support hypersonic zoom mechanics. The lens is capable of <b>focusing</b> from infinity to minimum <b>focusing</b> distance and back in under a second: so micro <b>focusing</b> is rapid. However, because of the narrow focus range (0.13x) the lens is not suitable for macro photography.|$|E
40|$|According to the <b>Focus</b> Projection theory, a <b>focused</b> word {{projects}} its <b>focus</b> to {{a larger}} syntactic constituent. When a Verb Phrase (VP) has two arguments (e. g., gave a boy a book), <b>focus</b> on the verb-final argument licenses <b>focus</b> on the VP. According to the Information Packaging theory of <b>focus</b> applied to Korean, <b>focus</b> on a theme argument licenses <b>focus</b> on the VP. However, production data of Korean <b>focus</b> support neither theory. Results show that in Korean a VP-initial argument is the most prominent in a sentence with VP <b>focus</b> {{regardless of the order}} or the type of the arguments, but is still not as prominent as the VP-initial word receiving narrow <b>focus...</b>|$|R
40|$|In Korean, <b>focus</b> is {{expressed}} in accentual phrasing. To ascertain whether words <b>focused</b> in this manner enjoy a processing advantage analogous to that conferred by <b>focus</b> as expressed in, e. g, English and Dutch, we devised sentences with target words in one of four conditions: prosodic <b>focus,</b> syntactic <b>focus,</b> prosodic + syntactic <b>focus,</b> and no <b>focus</b> as a control. 32 native speakers of Korean listened to blocks of 10 sentences, then were presented visually with words and asked {{whether or not they}} had heard them. Overall, words with <b>focus</b> were recognised significantly faster and more accurately than unfocused words. In addition, words with syntactic <b>focus</b> or syntactic + prosodic <b>focus</b> were recognised faster than words with prosodic <b>focus</b> alone. As for other languages, Korean <b>focus</b> confers processing advantage on the words carrying it. While prosodic <b>focus</b> does provide an advantage, however, syntactic <b>focus</b> appears to provide the greater beneficial effect for recognition memor...|$|R
40|$|This study {{investigates the}} {{acoustic}} realization of single vs. double <b>focus</b> in statements and yes/no questions in General American English. Four speakers produced {{four sets of}} utterances of different lengths with alternating <b>focus</b> and sentence type conditions. Results indicate that double <b>focus</b> increases max F 0 and duration of the <b>focused</b> word to a similar degree as single <b>focus</b> in both statements and yes/no questions. Furthermore, post-focus pitch range suppression occurs in both single- and double-focused statements. However, in yes/no questions, post-focus pitch range compression and raising occur only after single <b>focus</b> and <b>focus</b> 2 of double <b>focus.</b> In contrast, F 0 after <b>focus</b> 1 of double <b>focus</b> falls gradually until the stressed syllable in <b>focus</b> 2 in yes/no questions. These findings suggest that double <b>focus</b> interacts with sentence type in a more complicated way than single <b>focus</b> in shaping F 0 contours of English sentences...|$|R

40|$|This paper revisits Japanese <b>focus</b> prosody by {{comparing}} the realization of contrastive <b>focus</b> vs. neutral <b>focus</b> across 4 <b>focus</b> positions and 2 accenthoods. Post-focus F 0 Range compression (PFC) is found only in accented stimuli, while <b>focus</b> in unaccented stimuli is marked by Min F 0 lowering. Penultimate <b>focus</b> differs from other <b>focus</b> positions, {{in terms of its}} post-focus behavior. Intensity and Duration manifest patterns of <b>focus</b> marker distribution comparable to those of F 0. These results combined confirm that <b>focus</b> realization interacts closely with accenthood and <b>focus</b> position, and have implications that may enhance our understanding of Japanese pitch accent in general.

40|$|The use of {{word order}} and {{intonation}} to mark <b>focus</b> in child speech has received some attention. However, past work usually examined each device separately or only compared the realizations of <b>focused</b> vs. non-focused constituents. This paper investigates {{the interaction between}} word order and intonation in the marking of different <b>focus</b> types in 4 - to 5 -year old German-speaking children and an adult control group. An answer-reconstruction task was used to elicit syntactic (word order) and intonational <b>focus</b> marking of subject and objects (locus of <b>focus)</b> in three <b>focus</b> types (broad, narrow, and contrastive <b>focus).</b> The results indicate that both children and adults used intonation to distinguish broad from contrastive <b>focus</b> but they differed in the marking of narrow <b>focus.</b> Further, both groups preferred intonation to word order as device for <b>focus</b> marking. But children showed an early sensitivity {{for the impact of}} <b>focus</b> type and <b>focus</b> location on word order variation and on phonetic means to mark <b>focus...</b>|$|R

5000|$|A method {{variously}} {{referred to}} as trap <b>focus,</b> <b>focus</b> trap, or catch-in-focus uses autofocus {{to take a shot}} when a subject moves into the focal plane (at the relevant focal point); this can be used to get a <b>focused</b> shot of a rapidly moving object, particularly in sports or wildlife photography, or alternatively to set a [...] "trap" [...] so that a shot can automatically be taken without a person present. This is done by using AF to detect but not set <b>focus</b> - using manual <b>focus</b> to set <b>focus</b> (or switching to manual after <b>focus</b> has been set) but then using <b>focus</b> priority to detect <b>focus</b> and only release the shutter when an object is in <b>focus.</b> The technique works by choosing the <b>focus</b> adjustment (turning AF off), then setting the shooting mode to [...] "Single" [...] (AF-S), or more specifically <b>focus</b> priority, then depressing the shutter - when the subject moves into <b>focus,</b> the AF detects this (though it does not change the <b>focus),</b> and a shot is taken.|$|R
