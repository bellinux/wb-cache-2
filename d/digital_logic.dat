25|$|There are no {{cancellation}} or absorption {{problems with}} multiplication or division, though small errors may accumulate as operations are performed in succession.

25|$|<b>Digital</b> <b>logic</b> is the {{application}} of the Boolean algebra of 0 and 1 to electronic hardware consisting of logic gates connected to form a circuit diagram. Each gate implements a Boolean operation, and is depicted schematically by a shape indicating the operation.

40|$|BiCMOS {{technology}} was spawned {{by the need}} for higher performance <b>digital</b> <b>logics</b> {{back in the early}} 1980 s. Since then, with the aggressive scaling of CMOS technology, the cost/performance ratio of pure CMOS began to surpass that of the BiCMOS. This caused a temporary slow down in the development of BiCMOS technology in the late 1980 s. The rapid development of recent wireless technology requiring high performance mixed signal and RF circuits has resurrected the focus in the current generation of BiCMOS technology. SiGe HBTs can be designed to be compatible with conventional silicon-based CMOS fabrication processes, but with performance that is far superior to Si-BJTs.

25|$|Boolean {{operations}} {{are used in}} <b>digital</b> <b>logic</b> to combine the bits carried on individual wires, thereby interpreting them over {0,1}. When a vector of n identical binary gates are used to combine two bit vectors each of n bits, the individual bit operations can be understood collectively as a single operation on values from a Boolean algebra with 2n elements.|$|E
25|$|Phase-locked loops {{are widely}} {{employed}} in radio, telecommunications, {{computers and other}} electronic applications. They {{can be used to}} demodulate a signal, recover a signal from a noisy communication channel, generate a stable frequency at multiples of an input frequency (frequency synthesis), or distribute precisely timed clock pulses in <b>digital</b> <b>logic</b> circuits such as microprocessors. Since a single integrated circuit can provide a complete phase-locked-loop building block, the technique is widely used in modern electronic devices, with output frequencies from a fraction of a hertz up to many gigahertz.|$|E
25|$|Industrial {{robotics}} is a sub-branch in {{the industrial}} automation that aids in various manufacturing processes. Such manufacturing processes include; machining, welding, painting, assembling and material handling to name a few. Industrial robots utilizes various mechanical, electrical as well as software systems to allow for high precision, accuracy and speed that far exceeds any human performance. The birth of industrial robot came shortly after World War II as United States saw {{the need for a}} quicker way to produce industrial and consumer goods. Servos, <b>digital</b> <b>logic</b> and solid state electronics allowed engineers to build better and faster systems and overtime these systems were improved and revised to the point where a single robot is capable of running 24 hours a day with little or no maintenance.|$|E

25|$|Traditional {{telephone}} switches connected physical circuits (e.g., wire pairs) while modern telephone switches use {{a combination}} of space- and time-division switching. In other words, each voice channel is represented by a time slot (say 1 or 2) on a physical wire pair (A or B). In order to connect two voice channels (say A1 and B2) together, the telephone switch interchanges the information between A1 and B2. It switches both the time slot and physical connection. To do this, it exchanges data between the time slots and connections 8,000 times per second, under control of <b>digital</b> <b>logic</b> that cycles through electronic lists of the current connections. Using both types of switching makes a modern switch far smaller than either a space or time switch could be by itself.|$|E
25|$|A {{dedicated}} {{voltage comparator}} chip such as LM339 {{is designed to}} interface with a <b>digital</b> <b>logic</b> interface (to a TTL or a CMOS). The output is a binary state often used to interface real world signals to digital circuitry (see analog to digital converter). If there is a fixed voltage source from, for example, a DC adjustable device in the signal path, a comparator is just {{the equivalent of a}} cascade of amplifiers. When the voltages are nearly equal, the output voltage will not fall into one of the logic levels, thus analog signals will enter the digital domain with unpredictable results. To make this range as small as possible, the amplifier cascade is high gain. The circuit consists of mainly Bipolar transistors. For very high frequencies, the input impedance of the stages is low. This reduces the saturation of the slow, large P-N junction bipolar transistors that would otherwise lead to long recovery times. Fast small Schottky diodes, like those found in binary logic designs, improve the performance significantly though the performance still lags that of circuits with amplifiers using analog signals. Slew rate has no meaning for these devices. For applications in flash ADCs the distributed signal across eight ports matches the voltage and current gain after each amplifier, and resistors then behave as level-shifters.|$|E
500|$|In 1954, Bothe {{was awarded}} the Nobel Prize in Physics [...] "for the {{coincidence}} method and his discoveries made therewith". [...] However, his implementation of this method was very cumbersome, for it involved visual correlation of photographed pulses. Within {{a few weeks of}} reading his paper with Kolhörster, Rossi invented an improved electronic coincidence circuit, which made use of triode vacuum tubes. [...] The Rossi coincidence circuit has two major advantages: [...] it offers very precise temporal resolution and it can detect coincidences among any number of pulse sources. [...] These features make it possible to identify interesting events that produce coincident pulses in several counters. [...] These rare events stand out even in the presence of high rates of unrelated background pulses in the individual counters. [...] The circuit not only provided the basis for electronic instrumentation in nuclear and particle physics, but also implemented the first electronic AND circuit, which is a fundamental element of the <b>digital</b> <b>logic</b> that is ubiquitous in modern electronics.|$|E

40|$|The journalistic {{field is}} facing a {{paradigm}} shift with the digitalization of offline publications. This research aims to study the Swedish magazine Omvärlden, who since January 2015 has completely converted to an online magazine. The research aims to understand how this digitalization process has affected the content of Omvärlden and if it still upholds classic journalistic quality. Thus the research question is ”how has the digitalization of the magazine Omvärlden affected the journalistic content published on their digital platforms? ”. A qualitative content analysis was performed and the data was anchored {{in the concept of}} news form. The analysis was conducted in three steps; 1) comparing the offline magazine with the online magazine, 2) comparing collected data from one single day, June 5 th 2017, from all of Omvärlden’s digital platforms; Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, Omvarlden. se and Omvarldenberattar. se and finally 3) following an article and comparing how the story is shaped in each digital platform. The results pointed in several directions indicating that the content is indeed adapted to the various digital channels but to different extent. Classic journalistic <b>logics</b> intertwine with <b>digital</b> <b>logics</b> as the content is shaped and re-shaped depending on the platform of publication. The content is both fragmented and adjusted to social and <b>digital</b> media <b>logics.</b> On the other hand, it is also coherent and in accordance with classic journalistic content and news form. Due to the ever changing media environment the research shows journalistic content will have to adapt to several media logics when shaping the content. ...|$|R

500|$|In practice, {{computational}} addition may {{be achieved}} via XOR and AND bitwise logical operations {{in conjunction with}} bitshift operations {{as shown in the}} pseudocode below. Both XOR and AND gates are straightforward to realize in <b>digital</b> <b>logic</b> allowing the realization of full adder circuits which in turn may be combined into more complex logical operations. In modern digital computers, integer addition is typically the fastest arithmetic instruction, yet it has the largest impact on performance, since it underlies all floating-point operations as well as such basic tasks as address generation during memory access and fetching instructions during branching. To increase speed, modern designs calculate digits in parallel; these schemes go by such names as carry select, carry lookahead, and the Ling pseudocarry. Many implementations are, in fact, hybrids of these last three designs. Unlike addition on paper, addition on a computer often changes the addends. On the ancient abacus and adding board, both addends are destroyed, leaving only the sum. The influence of the abacus on mathematical thinking was strong enough that early Latin texts often claimed that in the process of adding [...] "a number to a number", both numbers vanish. In modern times, the ADD instruction of a microprocessor often replaces the augend with the sum but preserves the addend. In a high-level programming language, evaluating [...] does not change either a or b; if the goal is to replace a with the sum this must be explicitly requested, typically with the statement [...] Some languages such as C or C++ allow this to be abbreviated as [...]|$|E
