5|$|Bell alleged in his 2003 {{lawsuit that}} the <b>government</b> <b>employees</b> had {{actually}} planted an illegal GPS tracking device {{in his car}} months before the one ostensibly allowed by the October 2000 warrant, at least as early as Bell's April 2000 release from prison.

Bell also alleged that federal <b>government</b> <b>employees</b> had also illegally planted a GPS tracking transmitter in a vehicle he drove in June 1998, one which the government never disclosed. Bell further stated that his defense lawyers colluded to keep Bell from being able to demand disclosure of all such secretly planted devices.|$|E
