500|$|In November 1991, {{with the}} second Commander Keen trilogy of episodes nearing {{completion}} and their contractual obligations to Softdisk almost finished, id Software sat down to plan out their next major game. Designer Tom Hall, who initially {{wanted to do a}} third Keen trilogy, recognized that Carmack's programming focus had shifted from the 2D side-scrolling platform game series to 3D action games. After an initial proposal by Hall of a sci-fi project, [...] "It's Green and Pissed", Romero suggested a 3D remake of the 1981 Castle Wolfenstein. The team was interested in the idea, as Romero, Hall, and John Carmack all had fond memories of the original title and felt the maze-like shooter gameplay fit well with Carmack's 3D game engine, while Adrian Carmack was interested in moving away from the child-friendly art style of <b>Keen</b> <b>into</b> something more violent. Encouraged by the reception to his idea, Romero expounded on it by proposing a [...] "loud" [...] and [...] "cool" [...] fast action game where the player could shoot soldiers before dragging and looting their bodies. The core of the gameplay would be fast and simple, for Romero believed that due to the novelty of a 3D game and control scheme, players would not be receptive to more complicated, slow gameplay. He felt the game would occupy a unique place in the industry, which was then dominated by slower simulation and strategy games. Adrian and John Carmack were excited by the prospect, while Hall felt that it was enjoyable enough, and that since he was the company's designer that they could return to his ideas at a later date.|$|E
50|$|In {{his early}} {{academic}} works, he wrote on arts and was especially <b>keen</b> <b>into</b> popularizing it. His essay How the paintings should be watched, written in Berlin but published in Belgrade in 1898, gave practical guidelines to the spectators {{how they should}} see the paintings, pointing out to them that the times changed so the audience should not expect from modern painters to paint like the old masters did. Pinnacle of his efforts in this direction was the realization of his idea of the First Yugoslav Exhibition in Belgrade, 1904, where artists from the four Slavic nations (Serbs, Croats, Slovenes and Bulgarians) presented their works. The exhibition was a success, so he later founded Yugoslav Art Gallery within the National Museum.|$|E
