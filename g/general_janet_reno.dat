5|$|As {{a result}} of the {{discovery}} of the Watkins memo, and based upon a suggestion from the Office of Independent Counsel, on March 20, 1996, Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> requested that Whitewater Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr expand his inquiry to specifically include the travel office affair, in particular allegations that White House employees had lied about Hillary Clinton's role in the firings, and that David Watkins or Hillary Clinton had made false statements in previous testimony to the GAO, Congress, or the Independent Counsel.|$|E
5|$|McVeigh {{later said}} that he had {{contemplated}} assassinating Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno,</b> Lon Horiuchi, and others in preference to attacking a building, and after the bombing he {{said that he}} sometimes wished he had carried out a series of assassinations instead. He initially intended only to destroy a federal building, but he later decided that his message would be better received if many people were killed in the bombing. McVeigh's criterion for potential attack sites was that the target should house at least two of three federal law enforcement agencies: the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, and Firearms (ATF), the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI), or the Drug Enforcement Administration (DEA). He regarded the presence of additional law enforcement agencies, such as the Secret Service or the U.S. Marshals Service, as a bonus.|$|E

He received unanimous confirmation vote for this position along with an endorsement from the Senate Judiciary Committee's Republican subcommittee chairs.

5|$|In 1997, Carl Williams, the {{superintendent}} of the New Jersey State Police, {{wrote a letter to}} Pope John Paul II asking him to raise the issue of Shakur's extradition during his talks with President Fidel Castro. During the pope's visit to Cuba in 1998, Shakur agreed to an interview with NBC journalist Ralph Penza. Shakur later published an extensive criticism of the NBC segment, which inter-spliced footage of Trooper Foerster's grieving widow with an FBI photo connected to a bank robbery of which Shakur had been acquitted. On March 10, 1998 New Jersey Governor Christine Todd Whitman asked Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> to do whatever it would take to return Shakur from Cuba. Later in 1998, U.S. media widely reported claims that the United States State Department had offered to lift the Cuban embargo in exchange for the return of 90U.S. refugees, including Shakur.|$|E

5000|$|In 1997, {{after the}} {{retirement}} of Jamie Gorelick, Clinton nominated Holder to be the Deputy Attorney <b>General</b> under <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno.</b> Holder was confirmed several months later in the Senate by a unanimous vote. During his confirmation hearing, Holder's opposition {{to the death penalty}} was questioned, but he pledged his intention to cooperate with the current laws and Reno, saying, [...] "I am not a proponent of the death penalty, but I will enforce the law as this Congress gives it to us." [...] Holder was the first African-American to serve in that position.|$|R

25|$|In May 1998, Blumenthal, {{along with}} {{attorneys}} general from 19 {{other states and}} the District of Columbia, filed an anti-trust lawsuit against Microsoft accusing the company of abusing its monopoly power to stifle competition. The suit, which centered on Microsoft's Windows 98 operating system and the company's contractual restrictions imposed on personal computer manufacturers to tie the operating system to its Internet Explorer browser, was eventually merged with a federal case brought by the United States Department of Justice (DOJ) under Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno.</b>|$|E
25|$|Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> {{ordered the}} return of Elián González to his father and set a {{deadline}} of April 13, 2000, but the Miami relatives defied the order. Negotiations continued for several days as the house was surrounded by protesters as well as police. The relatives insisted on guarantees that they could live with the child for several months and retain custody, and that González would not be returned to Cuba. Negotiations carried on throughout the night, but Reno claimed that the relatives rejected all workable solutions.|$|E
50|$|David's wife, Linda Patrik, first {{suspected}} Theodore {{and urged}} David {{to read the}} manifesto when it was published. David recognized Ted's writing style, and the experienced criminal defense lawyer the couple hired notified authorities. On April 3, 1996, police arrested Ted in his rural cabin in Lincoln, Montana. David had received assurance from the FBI that his identity as the informant would be kept secret, but his name was leaked to the media. In addition, he sought a guarantee from federal prosecutors that Ted would receive appropriate psychiatric evaluation and treatment. The Justice Department's subsequent active pursuit {{of the death penalty}} for Ted, and Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno's</b> initial refusal to accept a plea bargain in exchange for a life sentence, was seen by Kaczynski and other members of his family as a betrayal. Such a plea bargain was eventually reached, and Ted was sentenced to serve life imprisonment with no possibility of parole. Kaczynski has stated in interviews that notifying federal authorities of his brother's possible involvement in the Unabomber case was a painful decision, but that he felt morally compelled to do it in order to save lives that might have been taken had the bombings continued.|$|R

25|$|Inslaw {{is known}} for {{developing}} Promis, an early case management software system. It is also known for a lawsuit that it brought against the United States Department of Justice in 1986 over Promis. Inslaw won damages in bankruptcy court, but these were overturned on appeal. The suit resulted in several Justice Department internal reviews, two Congressional investigations, {{the appointment of a}} special counsel by Attorney General William P. Barr, and a lengthy review of the special counsel's report under Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno.</b> Inslaw's claims were finally referred by Congress to the Court of Federal Claims in 1995, and the dispute ended with the Court's ruling against Inslaw in 1998.|$|E
25|$|In 1986 an Immigration Judge {{agreed not}} to send Fidel Armando-Alfanso back to Cuba, based on his {{membership}} in a particular social group (gay people) who were persecuted and feared further persecution {{by the government of}} Cuba. The Board of Immigration Appeals upheld the decision in 1990, and in 1994, then-Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> ordered this decision to be a legal precedent binding on Immigration Judges and the Asylum Office, and established sexual orientation as a grounds for asylum. However, in 2002 the Board of Immigration Appeals “suggested in an ambiguous and internally inconsistent decision that the ‘protected characteristic’ and ‘social visibility’ tests may represent dual requirements in all social group cases.” The requirement for social visibility means that the government of a country from which the person seeking asylum is fleeing must recognize their social group, and that LGBT people who hide their sexual orientation, for example out of fear of persecution, may not be eligible for asylum under this mandate.|$|E
500|$|Several politicians, {{including}} US Representative Bobby Rush, {{requested that}} State's Attorney Richard A.

500|$|ASL is {{distinguished}} by its requirement that all second-year students complete a mandatory Alternative Dispute Resolution (ADR) class. [...] The school has also held ADR training in local schools; this program drew national attention, particularly from former U.S. Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno,</b> who has publicly congratulated the school on this effort. Students are given {{an overview of}} different types of conflict resolutions, particularly mediation, negotiation, and arbitration. Ethical issues are explored in addition to legal and policy ramifications. Students learn {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} each method of dispute resolution and learn which methods are appropriate for certain situations.|$|E
500|$|On June 18, 1996, Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> {{asked the}} FBI {{to look into}} it; FBI Director Louis Freeh {{acknowledged}} that both the FBI and especially the White House had committed [...] "egregious violations of privacy" [...] (in some cases the background reports contained information about extramarital affairs, trangressions with the law, and medical issues). On June 21 Reno decided it was {{a conflict of interest}} for the U.S. Department of Justice to further investigate the matter, and thus recommended that it be folded into the overall umbrella of the Whitewater investigations, under charge of Independent Counsel Kenneth Starr. In any case, Starr had already begun looking into it.|$|E
500|$|There was {{controversy}} as {{to whether}} the document should be published, but the Department of Justice headed by Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno,</b> along with FBI Director Louis Freeh, recommended publication out of concern for public safety and in hopes that a reader could identify the author. Bob Guccione of Penthouse volunteered to publish it, but Kaczynski replied that, since Penthouse was less [...] "respectable" [...] than the other publications, he would in that case [...] "reserve the right to plant one (and only one) bomb intended to kill, after our manuscript has been published." [...] The pamphlet was published by The New York Times and The Washington Post on September 19, 1995. Penthouse never published it.|$|E

Ginsburg was recommended to Clinton by then-U.S. Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno</b> after a suggestion by Utah Republican Senator Orrin Hatch. At {{the time of her}} nomination, Ginsburg was viewed as a moderate. President Clinton was reportedly looking to increase the Court's diversity, which Ginsburg did as the first Jewish justice since the 1969 resignation of Justice Abe Fortas and as only the second female appointee. The American Bar Association's Standing Committee on the Federal Judiciary rated Ginsburg as [...] "well qualified", its highest possible rating for a prospective justice.|$|E
500|$|Kaczynski was {{the target}} of the Federal Bureau of Investigation's (FBI) longest and costliest investigation. Before his {{identity}} was known, the FBI used the title [...] "UNABOM" [...] (UNiversity & Airline BOMber) to refer to his case, which resulted in the media calling him the Unabomber. The FBI (as well as Attorney <b>General</b> <b>Janet</b> <b>Reno)</b> pushed for the publication of Kaczynski's manifesto, which led to his sister-in-law, and then his brother, recognizing Kaczynski's style of writing and beliefs from the manifesto, and tipping off the FBI. After his arrest in 1996, Kaczynski tried unsuccessfully to dismiss his court-appointed lawyers because they wanted to plead insanity {{in order to avoid the}} death penalty, as he did not believe he was insane. In 1998 a plea bargain was reached, under which Kaczynski pleaded guilty to all charges and was sentenced to life in prison without the possibility of parole.|$|E
500|$|National Security Advisor Sandy Berger called President Bill Clinton at 5:35 AM on August 7 {{to notify}} {{him of the}} bombings.

The group's objective was to plan a military response to the East Africa embassy bombings. Based on electronic and phone intercepts, physical evidence from Nairobi, and interrogations, officials soon suspected bin Laden as the perpetrator of the attacks. On August 8, the White House asked the CIA and the Joint Chiefs of Staff to prepare a targets list; the initial list included twenty targets in Sudan, Afghanistan, and an unknown third country, although it was narrowed down on August 12.|$|E
