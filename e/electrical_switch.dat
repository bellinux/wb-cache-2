30|$|<b>Electrical</b> <b>switching</b> in the electrode/oxide/electrode {{structure}} has attracted significant attention {{due to its}} rich physics and potential application {{in the next generation}} nonvolatile memory [1]. A large variety of materials (such as metal oxides, solid electrolytes, and organic materials) have been found to possess the characteristics of <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> [2 – 9]. Different models have also been proposed to understand the underlying physics of <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> [10 – 13]. However, the microscopic nature of <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> is still under debate, and exploring appropriate materials for fabricating two-terminal resistive random access memory (RRAM) based on <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> is still the most important issue. Recently, nanoscale Pt/TiO 2 /Pt switches have been fabricated and well understood by memristive switching mechanism, in which the drift of + 2 -charged oxygen vacancies under an applied electric field creates or annihilates conducting channels and then switches the device to on or off state [14, 15]. Therefore, nonstoichiometic oxides, in which oxygen vacancies play an important role on their electronic structures, might be the most appropriate materials for fabricating next generation nanoelectronic devices.|$|R

The phase change memories based on <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> appear to be the most promising next generation non-volatile memories, due to many attributes which include high endurance in write/read operations, shorter write/read time, high scalability, multi-bit capability, lower cost and a compatibility with complementary metal oxide semiconductor technology. Studies on the <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> behavior of chalcogenide glasses help us in identifying newer glasses which could be used for phase change memory applications. In particular, studies on the composition dependence of <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> parameters and investigations on the correlation between switching behavior with other material properties are necessary for the selection of proper compositions which make good memory materials. In this review, an attempt has been made to summarize the dependence of the <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> behavior of chalcogenide glasses with other material properties such as network topological effects, glass transition & crystallization temperature, activation energy for crystallization, thermal diffusivity, electrical resistivity and others...|$|R

Operated by an applied magnetic field, reed switches are used as reed relays, automotive sensors, robotics sensors, security sensors and are found in many toys and games. The reed switch was invented in 1936 by W. B. Elwood at Bell Telephone Laboratories.|$|E
25|$|A commutated DC motor has {{a set of}} {{rotating}} windings {{wound on}} an armature mounted on a rotating shaft. The shaft also carries the commutator, a long-lasting rotary <b>electrical</b> <b>switch</b> that periodically reverses the flow of current in the rotor windings as the shaft rotates. Thus, every brushed DC motor has AC flowing through its rotating windings. Current flows through one or more pairs of brushes that bear on the commutator; the brushes connect an external source of electric power to the rotating armature.|$|E
25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated <b>electrical</b> <b>switch</b> {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to detect a fault condition and, by interrupting continuity, to immediately discontinue electrical flow. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then has to be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect an individual household appliance up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. Inspired by the works of American scientist Joseph Henry and English scientist Michael Faraday, the circuit breaker was invented by an American, Charles Grafton Page.|$|E

25|$|A {{circuit breaker}} is an {{automatically}} operated <b>electrical</b> <b>switch</b> {{designed to protect}} an electrical circuit from damage caused by excess current, typically resulting from an overload or short circuit. Its basic function is to interrupt current flow after a fault is detected. Unlike a fuse, which operates once and then must be replaced, a circuit breaker can be reset (either manually or automatically) to resume normal operation. Circuit breakers are made in varying sizes, from small devices that protect low-current circuits or individual household appliance, up to large switchgear designed to protect high voltage circuits feeding an entire city. The generic function of a circuit breaker, RCD or a fuse, as an automatic means of removing power from a faulty system is often abbreviated as ADS (Automatic Disconnection of Supply).|$|E

The first was a [...] weapon dropped by a Hellcat that exploded on the roof of her [...] "Bruno" [...] main gun turret. The explosion destroyed the quadruple [...] anti-aircraft gun mount located on top of the turret, but did not cause any significant damage to the turret itself. The second bomb to strike the ship was a [...] armour-piercing weapon which penetrated through five decks, killed a sailor in a radio room and lodged near an <b>electrical</b> <b>switch</b> room. This bomb failed to explode, and German bomb disposal experts later determined that it had been only partially filled with explosives.

British fighters also attacked other German ships and facilities in the Kaafjord area, damaging two patrol boats, a minesweeper and a radar station, as well as destroying an ammunition dump and three guns of an anti-aircraft battery. Tirpitzs last remaining Arado Ar 196 seaplane was attacked in Bukta harbour and damaged beyond repair. Four Corsairs and two Hellcats were shot down during the raid, and the battleship's crew suffered 8 fatalities and 18 men wounded. Casualties among the anti-aircraft units stationed around Kaafjord were heavy.|$|E

Around 200 tourists were stuck inside the arch {{for up to three}} hours because the severed cable contacted a high-voltage rail, causing a fuse to blow. The north tram was temporarily affected by the power outage as well, but some passengers were able to exit the arch through the emergency stairs and elevator.

An arch official said the visitors, most of whom stayed calm during the ordeal, were not in any danger; they were later given refunds. The incident occurred while visitors in the arch were watching a fireworks display, and no one was seriously injured in the event. However, two people received medical treatment; one person needed oxygen and the other was diabetic.

Bistable <b>electrical</b> <b>switching</b> phenomena arising from four processes, viz., trapping–detrapping, charge transfer, conformational change and nanocomposite redox effects, in electroactive polymers are described.
