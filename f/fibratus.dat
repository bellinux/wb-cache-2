5|$|Cirrus <b>Fibratus</b> clouds {{appear as}} thin and fibrous looking. Noticeably, {{they are the}} most common type of cirrus cloud. They might {{indicate}} windy weather, since they are mostly formed by wind shear on higher altitudes.|$|E
5|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, <b>fibratus,</b> spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus. Cirrus castellanus is a species that has cumuliform tops caused by high-altitude convection rising up from the main cloud body. Cirrus <b>fibratus</b> looks striated and {{is the most common}} cirrus species. Cirrus uncinus clouds are hooked and are the form that is usually called mare's tails. Of the varieties, Cirrus intortus has an extremely contorted shape, and cirrus radiatus has large, radial bands of cirrus clouds that stretch across the sky. Kelvin–Helmholtz waves are a form of cirrus intortus that has been twisted into loops by vertical wind shear.|$|E
5|$|Random, {{isolated}} cirrus do {{not have}} any particular significance. A large number of cirrus clouds can be a sign of an approaching frontal system or upper air disturbance. This signals a change in weather in the near future, which usually becomes stormier. If the cloud is a cirrus castellanus, there might be instability at the high altitude level. When the clouds deepen and spread, especially when they are of the cirrus radiatus variety or cirrus <b>fibratus</b> species, this usually indicates an approaching weather front. If it is a warm front, the cirrus clouds spread out into cirrostratus, which then thicken and lower into altocumulus and altostratus. The next set of clouds are the rain-bearing nimbostratus clouds. When cirrus clouds precede a cold front, squall line or multicellular thunderstorm, it is because they are blown off the anvil, and the next to arrive are the cumulonimbus clouds. Kelvin-Helmholtz waves indicate extreme wind shear at high levels.|$|E
500|$|Cirrostratus clouds {{can appear}} as a milky sheen in the sky or as a {{striated}} sheet. They are sometimes similar to altostratus and are distinguishable from the latter because the sun or moon is always clearly visible through transparent cirrostratus, in contrast to altostratus which tends to be opaque or translucent. Cirrostratus come in two species, <b>fibratus</b> and nebulosus. The ice crystals in these clouds vary depending upon the height in the cloud. Towards the bottom, at temperatures of around [...] to , the crystals tend to be long, solid, hexagonal columns. Towards {{the top of the}} cloud, at temperatures of around [...] to , the predominant crystal types are thick, hexagonal plates and short, solid, hexagonal columns. These clouds commonly produce halos, and sometimes the halo is the only indication that such clouds are present. They are formed by warm, moist air being lifted slowly to a very high altitude. When a warm front approaches, cirrostratus clouds become thicker and descend forming altostratus clouds, and rain usually begins 12 to 24 hours later.|$|E
2500|$|Cirriform clouds {{have three}} non-convective species that can form in mostly stable airmass conditions. [...] Cirrus <b>fibratus</b> {{comprise}} filaments {{that may be}} straight, wavy, or occasionally twisted by non-convective wind shear. The species uncinus is similar but has upturned hooks at the ends. [...] Cirrus spissatus appear as opaque patches that can show light grey shading.|$|E
2500|$|A {{second group}} {{describes}} the occasional arrangements of cloud structures into particular patterns that are discernible by a surface-based observer (cloud fields usually being visible {{only from a}} significant altitude above the formations). These varieties are not always present with the genera and species {{with which they are}} otherwise associated, but only appear when atmospheric conditions favor their formation. Intortus and vertebratus varieties occur on occasion with cirrus <b>fibratus.</b> [...] They are respectively filaments twisted into irregular shapes, and those that are arranged in fishbone patterns, usually by uneven wind currents that favor the formation of these varieties. [...] The variety radiatus is associated with cloud rows of a particular type that appear to converge at the horizon. [...] It is sometimes seen with the <b>fibratus</b> and uncinus species of cirrus, the stratiformis species of altocumulus and stratocumulus, the mediocris and sometimes humilis species of cumulus, and with the genus altostratus.|$|E
2500|$|Of the {{stratiform}} group, high-level cirrostratus comprises two species. [...] Cirrostratus nebulosus has {{a rather}} diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail. [...] Cirrostratus <b>fibratus</b> is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional {{to or from}} cirrus. Mid-level altostratus and multi-level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species. Low stratus is of the species nebulosus except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus (see below).|$|E
2500|$|Another variety, {{duplicatus}} (closely spaced {{layers of}} the same type, one above the other), is sometimes found with cirrus of both the <b>fibratus</b> and uncinus species, and with altocumulus and stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and lenticularis. [...] The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. [...] It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. [...] It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrostratus <b>fibratus</b> {{is a type}} of {{cirrostratus}} cloud. The name cirrostratus <b>fibratus</b> {{is derived}} from Latin, meaning [...] "fibrous". Cirrostratus <b>fibratus</b> is one of the two most common forms that cirrostratus often takes, with the other being cirrostratus nebulosus. They are formed from strong, continuous winds blowing at high altitudes, and they often cover {{a large portion of the}} sky. Cirrostratus <b>fibratus</b> may often develop from either cirrus <b>fibratus</b> or cirrus spissatus cloud. Precipitation is often imminent behind these clouds; however, they are not a precipitation-producing cloud.|$|E

5000|$|Cirrostratus [...] is a high-level, very thin, {{generally}} uniform stratiform genus-type of cloud, {{composed of}} ice-crystals. It {{is difficult to}} detect and is capable of forming halos when the cloud {{takes the form of}} thin cirrostratus nebulosus. The cloud has a fibrous texture with no halos if it is thicker cirrostratus <b>fibratus.</b> On the approach of a frontal system, the cirrostratus often begins as nebulosus and turns to <b>fibratus.</b> If the cirrostratus begins as fragmented <b>fibratus</b> it often means the front is weak. Cirrostratus is usually located above 5.5 km (18,000 ft). Its presence indicates a large amount of moisture in the upper atmosphere.|$|E

50|$|Cirrus {{comes in}} four {{distinct}} species; Cirrus castellanus, <b>fibratus,</b> spissatus, and uncinus; which are each {{divided into four}} varieties: intortus, vertebratus, radiatus, and duplicatus.

5000|$|Mutatus mother clouds: Cirrostratus <b>fibratus</b> cirromutatus or cirrocumulomutatus are {{the result}} of a {{complete}} transformation from cirrus and cirrocumulus genus types. Cirrostratus nebulosis altostratomutatus results when a high grey nebulous altostratus layer thins out into a whitish layer of featureless high cloud.|$|E
50|$|Altostratus {{most often}} {{takes the form}} of a featureless sheet of cloud but can be wavy (undulatus) as a result of wind shear through the cloud. It can also be {{fragmented}} (<b>fibratus)</b> with clear sky visible, which often signals the approach of a weakened or upper level warm front.|$|E
5000|$|Cirrostratus {{nebulosus}} is {{a species}} of high-level cirrostratus cloud. The name cirrostratus nebulosus is derived from Latin, meaning [...] "full of vapor, foggy, cloudy, dark". Cirrostratus nebulosus {{is one of the}} two most common forms that cirrostratus often takes, with the other being cirrostratus <b>fibratus.</b> The nebulosus species is featureless and uniform, while the <b>fibratus</b> species has a fibrous appearance. Cirrostratus nebulosus are formed by gently rising air. The cloud is often hard to see unless the sun shines through it at the correct angle, forming a halo. While usually very light, the cloud may also be very dense, and the exact appearance of the cloud can vary from one formation to another. In the winter, precipitation often follows behind these clouds; however, they are not a precipitation-producing cloud.|$|E

5000|$|Cirrus {{duplicatus}} is {{a variety}} of cirrus cloud. The name cirrus duplicatus is derived from Latin, meaning [...] "double". The duplicatus variety of cirrus clouds occurs when {{there are at least}} two layers of cirrus clouds. Most of the time, occurrences of cirrus <b>fibratus</b> and cirrus uncinus are in the duplicatus form. Like stratus clouds, cirrus clouds are often seen in the duplicatus form.|$|E
5000|$|Stable or mostly stable Of the {{stratiform}} group, high-level cirrostratus comprises two species. Cirrostratus nebulosus has {{a rather}} diffuse appearance lacking in structural detail. [...] Cirrostratus <b>fibratus</b> is a species made of semi-merged filaments that are transitional {{to or from}} cirrus. Mid-level altostratus and multi-level nimbostratus always have a flat or diffuse appearance and are therefore not subdivided into species. Low stratus is of the species nebulosus except when broken up into ragged sheets of stratus fractus (see below).|$|E
5000|$|Species: Cirrostratus <b>fibratus</b> (Cs fib) {{is a high}} fibrous sheet {{similar to}} cirrus but with less {{detached}} semi-merged filaments. It is reported in the SYNOP code as CH8 or as CH5 or 6 (depending {{on the amount of}} sky covered) if increasing in amount. If the high cloud covers the entire sky and takes on the form of a featureless veil, it is classified as cirrostratus of the species nebulosus (Cs neb) and is coded CH7.|$|E
50|$|Cirrostratus clouds {{sometimes}} {{signal the}} approach of a warm front if they form after cirrus and spread from one area across the sky, and thus may be signs that precipitation might follow in the next 12 to 24 hours or as soon as 6-8 hours if the front is fast moving. If the cirrostratus is broken <b>fibratus</b> it can mean that the front is weak and that stratus rather than nimbostratus will be the precipitating cloud (meaning drizzle or snow grains instead of moderate rain or snow). Cumulus humilis or stratocumulus clouds are often found below cirrostratus formations, due to the stable air associated with cirrostratus creating an inversion and restricting convection, causing cumuliform clouds to become flattened. Contrails also tend to spread out and can be visible for {{up to an hour}} in cirrostratus.|$|E

The variety undulatus (having a wavy undulating base) can occur with any clouds of the species stratiformis or lenticularis, and with altostratus. It is only rarely observed with stratus nebulosus. The variety lacunosus is caused by localized downdrafts that create circular holes {{in the form of}} a honeycomb or net. It is occasionally seen with cirrocumulus and altocumulus of the species stratiformis, castellanus, and floccus, and with stratocumulus of the species stratiformis and castellanus.CombinationsIt is possible for some species to show combined varieties at one time, especially if one variety is opacity-based and the other is pattern-based. An example of this would be a layer of altocumulus stratiformis arranged in seemingly converging rows separated by small breaks. The full technical name of a cloud in this configuration would be altocumulus stratiformis radiatus perlucidus, which would identify respectively its genus, species, and two combined varieties.|$|E
