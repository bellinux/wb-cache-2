40|$|This paper works {{through some}} of the {{epistemological}} and methodological con-sequences of an unreflexive use of white suburbs as the expected residential des-tination in U. S. spatial assimilation research. Foregrounding immigrant suburban-ization in spatial assimilation occludes alternative geographic trajectories; simply put, spatial diffusion need not be central city to suburban decentralization. More problematically, spatial assimilation research often translates residential movement to the suburbs into increasing proximity with whites. This results in the degree of segregation from whites becoming the standard by which immigrant assimilative progress is gauged. Building on critical whiteness studies and recent research on aspatial assimilation, we develop some new theoretical entry points into the process of spatial assimilation. We treat metropolitan areas as constellations of neighbor-hoods rather than a central city-suburban doughnut and become circumspect in our use of whites as a referent category. Our investigation of spaces of assimila-tion in greater Los Angeles reveals that established immigrants are more dispersed residentially than recent conational arrivals, although the effect varies by group. For many immigrant groups, these dispersions from concentrations of initial settle-ment do not reduce segregation from whites. Segregation lessens over time, how-ever, between immigrants and other native-born Americans. For many groups, but by no means all, a <b>dispersed</b> <b>residential</b> <b>pattern</b> is associated with higher quality neighborhoods...|$|E

40|$|The {{emergence}} of GIS {{and the availability}} of high resolution geographic data have improved our ability to investigate the residential segregation in cities and to identify the temporal changes of the spatial phenomena. Using GIS, we have quantitatively and visually analyzed the correspondence between land-use distribution and Arab <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> and their changes in the period between 1983 and 2008 in five mixed Arab-Jewish Israeli cities. Results show a correspondence between the dynamics of Arab/Jewish <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> and the spatial distribution of various land-uses. Arab <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> diffused faster towards areas with relatively inferior land-uses than towards areas with more attractive land-uses, in which a gentrification process occurred. Moreover, large-scale non-residential land-uses act as spatial partitions that divide between Arab and Jewish residential areas. Understanding the association between the urban environment and <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> can help in formulating an appropriate social and spatial policy concerning planning of land-uses and design of the built environment in mixed cities. ...|$|R

The origins and causes of sedentism are major archaeological research problems, and researchers concern themselves with the transition between nomadism and sedentism. In this paper I {{argue that there is}} only variation in <b>residential</b> <b>patterns,</b> which may include sedentism; that sedentism, however it is defined, is not a stable <b>residential</b> <b>pattern</b> among hunter-gatherers; and that, rather than explain the causes of sedentism, one must explain shifts in <b>residential</b> mobility <b>patterns.</b> The case study illustrating these points is drawn from the dry interior region of the Pacific Northwest, the Intermontane Plateau, which preserves an excellent record of <b>residential</b> mobility <b>patterns</b> spanning the last 6, 000 years...|$|R

40|$|The {{effect of}} {{immigration}} on social cohesion {{is a political}} issue, expressed as a fear that racially skewed <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> represent ghettos which prevent integration. <b>Residential</b> <b>patterns</b> have been measured by indices of segregation. The range of indices is reviewed in the paper and measured empirically for England and Wales by using census data for 1991 and 2001, including a new index of migration dispersal. There {{has been an increase}} in residential mixing as a result of growing minority populations and their more even spread across localities. These two trends are identified by two commonly used indices of segregation which are moving in opposite directions for the most recent immigrant groups. The sensitivity of each index to modifiable area boundaries makes them unsuitable for evaluation of cities' relative performance. The <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> of cities after immigration are more clearly understood by using demographic measures of migration and age structure.

40|$|This paper {{deals with}} the {{influence}} of the organization of an agent’s ethnic identities on ethnic <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> by extending the Schelling model to include a further hierarchical level; that is, the agents’ ethnic identities are organized in a two-level hierarchy (each agent belongs to an ethnic group and subgroup). Agent-based simulation reveals that the <b>residential</b> <b>pattern</b> created at given levels of ethnic residential distribution can also be a response to intolerance behaviour at another level. The simulation experiments also show that these patterns can qualitatively change in response to different intensities of intolerance at both and/or either level. However, {{as a result of the}} asymmetric nesting of agents’ ethnic identities and the tangible <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> subsequently established, top-down and bottom-up influences are generally displayed in the following form; intolerance behaviour at the top level strengthens the segregation observed at the bottom level whereas intolerance behaviour at the bottom level tends to weaken the segregation observed at the top level. This means that intolerance-motivated segregation between a minority and a majority in a city tends to strengthen segregation between ethnic subgroups within an ethnic minority community. Conversely, mutual intolerance between ethnic subgroups within an ethnic minority tends to moderate residential segregation between that minority community and the majority population. I suggest that these conclusions can be used empirically to evaluate the consequences of individual preferences for the ethnic composition characterizing <b>residential</b> <b>patterns.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Aiming to {{introduce}} market mechanisms to an administratively managed and heavily subsidized housing system, the ongoing housing reform in urban China has brought {{dramatic changes in}} housing provision and consumption. Chinese households have started to enjoy freedom of housing choice that was not possible in socialist China. Yet, their choices are constrained because of the transitional nature of the current housing system where both institutional forces and market mechanisms operate. It {{is the goal of}} this research to examine how these two types of forces interact and how households make their housing choices in the transitional housing system. In contrast to the economic and socio-demographic perspectives on housing choices in the Western literature, I argue that a framework incorporating social relationships between the state, work units and employees is needed to understand households’ housing choice in transitional urban China. Associated with housing choices, the homogenous <b>residential</b> <b>pattern</b> in socialist China is gradually changing and a residential sorting is in process. It is also my goal to study the change of <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> and its dynamics in urban China. Four research questions are proposed: (1) What kinds of individual and household characteristics affect housing choice, and how relevant are the existing Western theories? (2) What are the roles of work units in housing choice in transitional urban China? (3) What {{is the role of the}} central state in constraining housing choice in transitional urban China? (4) Is a new form of <b>residential</b> <b>pattern</b> emerging? What factors contribute to the change of <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> and how relevant are the existing Western theories? A complementary methodology combining both quantitative and qualitative analyses, both national studies and case studies will be employed. The data include a national survey data, in-depth interviews in three cities, and archival data such as housing policies and housing statistics. A multi-level logistic model will be used to examine individual, household, work unit level and state level factors affecting households’ housing choices, and maps on <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> will be created...|$|R

Authors first point out how Paramaribo is at present {{one of the most}} multiethnic and multicultural cities of the Caribbean, and discuss the continuing importance of ethnic identity and boundaries. They further describe the history of Paramaribo's development since the period of slavery and after abolition, when many Creoles migrated to the city. Hindustani started migrating in higher numbers to Paramaribo since the early 20 th c., mainly to the urban periphery, and since the 1960 s also more Javanese. More recently (since the 1980 s) migrants to Paramaribo include Maroons, Amerindians, Chinese, and Brazilians. Authors examine in how far the <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> were determined by socioeconomic factors, and/or by ethnicity. They conclude that socioeconomic factors have overall become more influential in <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> than ethnicity. They point out that residential ethnic mixing has increased, as almost half of Paramaribo's neighbourhoods are mixed, with no dominant ethnic group, although some ethnic concentration continues, as a quarter of the neighbourhoods can be called Creole, one-fifth of them Hindustani, and Creoles (and Maroons) reside for a higher percentage in the city centre, and Hindustani and Javanese more in the urban periphery...|$|R
40|$|The {{controversy}} regarding China's historical <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> {{is related}} to the lack of investigation into demographic influences on past kinship structures and household formation. This study uses computer micro-simulation to examine demographic feasibility of people living in large multi-generation households under the demographic conditions close to those recorded in Chinese history. It investigates both the composition of households in which individuals live at a particular point in their life course and the transition in their household structure and the length of time they spend in households of different types. The simulation exercise suggests that demographic regimes and household formation systems similar to those operating in China in the past produce diverse <b>residential</b> <b>patterns,</b> in which individuals could experience different household forms at different stages of the life cycle.

40|$|Abstract: The {{residential}} {{style of}} rodents varies across and within species from colonial to solitary and territorial [1]. A mechanism that supports this behavioral distinction might be differential {{levels of social}} motivation rather than explicit species-typical social behavior. Accordingly, socially motivated animals learn seeking behavior {{that leads to a}} colonial <b>residential</b> <b>pattern</b> and socially unmotivated animals do not learn this behavior and remain solitary. The present experi-ments test this hypothesis by measuring social motivation in a gregarious social species of vole, the prairie vole, and in a solitary species, the meadow vole. Although their explicit social behavior was similar, Prairie voles readily learned to per-form an instrumental response for access to a target vole while meadow voles did not. Neither the estrus status nor the sex of the target affected instrumental responding in either species. In sum, differential social motivation may contribute to distinctive <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> in rodents...|$|R

40|$|The {{pattern and}} level of {{separation}} among ethnic groups continues to change, and there are certainly more mixed neighborhoods both in cities and suburbs than two decades ago.

The research in this article shows that those who report themselves of more than one race have high levels of residential integration both in central cities and suburbs. These <b>residential</b> <b>patterns</b> can be interpreted as further evidence of tentative steps to a society in which race per se is less critical in <b>residential</b> <b>patterning.</b> The level of integration, for Asian mixed and black mixed is different and substantially higher than for those who report one race alone.
