40|$|Abstract: Percutaneous {{coronary}} angioplasty is increasingly {{employed in the}} treatment of patients with complex coronary artery disease. Different steerable guide wires used to open occluded vessel and facilitate balloon and stent deployment. However, the guide-wire itself is not without hazard: it may perforate or dissect the vessel, but fracture or entrapment is uncommon. Its management depends on the clinical situation of the patient, as well as the position and length of the remnant. In this review we discuss the angioplasty guide-wire fracture and <b>entrapment</b> <b>risk</b> factors, potential risks and management...|$|E
40|$|In this article, {{we provide}} a {{longitudinal}} account of institutionally originated, cohort inequalities in a two-tier labour market, taking Italy as an exemplary case of partial and targeted deregulation. We examine the incidence and career consequences of temporary employment relying on panel data, across reforms {{implemented in the}} 1990 s and early 2000 s. A substitution effect is found for {{the initial stages of}} workers’ careers: while the youngest cohorts of school-leavers increasingly enter the flexible labour market, access to stable positions is hampered. Previous experiences in the flexible segment of the labour force also increase the risk of entrapment in temporary jobs. This lock-in dynamic is more visible for post-reforms cohorts and might have increased labour market inefficiency. Indeed, the <b>entrapment</b> <b>risk</b> has risen disproportionately for those individuals whose (un) observed characteristics could instead predict a faster exit from the flexible labour market, possibly towards stable positions. Our findings cast doubts on the transitory nature of temporary work in Italy and on the efficiency of partial and targeted reforms...|$|E
30|$|Analysis of {{the time}} when {{passenger}} entrapment incidents happen in the Metro revealed a midday peak (12 – 3  pm). From this information and the description of the incidents, it was assumed that a higher percentage of elderly passengers creates additional <b>entrapment</b> <b>risks.</b> The drivers tend to agree with this giving the related causal factor fifth highest average mark. The high mark for direct sunlight does not align with the midday peak statistics as the sun is in zenith during that time. Hence, there is little risk of direct sunlight affecting the DOO equipment. However, morning and evening rush hours also have significantly elevated levels of passenger entrapments. This is when the sunlight causal factor can be the most important.|$|R
40|$|Objective: {{dimensional}} {{guidelines for}} bedrails {{have been developed}} to minimise the <b>risk</b> of patient <b>entrapment</b> within the bed. We examined whether bedrails in a large Irish teaching hospital complied with these standards. Design and setting: survey of 60 accessible beds in six hospital wards. Methods: a specialised cone and cylinder tool that mimics the size and weight of a small adult neck and head was used to determine gaps in the four zones most associated with entrapment. Results: the number of failures for each zone was 15 beds for zone 1 (any space between the perimeters of the rail); 42 beds for zone 2 (the space under the rail); 41 beds for zone 3 (the space between the inside surface of the bedrail and the mattress) and 13 beds for zone 4 (the space between the mattress and rail {{at the end of the}} rail). Failures were more common with hydraulic adjusted than with electric profiling beds. Mattresses that were the wrong size (usually too narrow) or too soft and bedrails that were loose or were poorly maintained accounted for many failures. Conclusion: many beds used in our hospital did not comply with dimensional standards to minimise <b>entrapment</b> <b>risks.</b> This emphasises the need for careful selection of patients for whom bedrails are to be used as well as the need for monitoring and maintenance of bed systems...|$|R

40|$|Objectives The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} whether whole-body vibration (WBV) is associated with prolapsed lumbar intervertebral disc (PID) and nerve root entrapment among patients with low-back pain (LBP) undergoing magnetic resonance imaging (MRI). Methods A consecutive series of patients referred for lumbar MRI because of LBP were compared with controls X-rayed for other reasons. Subjects were questioned about occupational activities loading the spine, psychosocial factors, driving, personal characteristics, mental health, and certain beliefs about LBP. Exposure to WBV was assessed by six measures, including weekly duration of professional driving, hours driven at a spell, and current 8 -hour daily equivalent root-mean-square acceleration A(8). Cases were sub-classified according to whether or not PID/nerve root entrapment was present. Associations with WBV were examined separately for cases with and without these MRI findings, with adjustment for age, sex, and other potential confounders. Results Altogether 237 cases and 820 controls were studied, including 183 professional drivers and 176 cases with PID and/or nerve root <b>entrapment.</b> <b>Risks</b> associated with WBV tended to be lower for LBP with PID/nerve root entrapment but somewhat higher for risks of LBP without these abnormalities. However, associations with the six metrics of exposure were all weak and not statistically significant. Neither exposure–response relationships nor increased risk of PID/nerve root entrapment from professional driving or exposure at an A(8) above the European Union daily exposure action level were found. Conclusions WBV may be a cause of LBP but it was not associated with PID or nerve root entrapment in this study. <br/...|$|R

2500|$|Following the 15 June 1940 {{breakthrough}} by German forces {{through the}} Saar gap, the Germans advanced along {{the rear of}} the Maginot Line. [...] The German 167th Infantry Division approached Kerfent, Bambesch, Einseling [...] and Téting, now manned only by their individual garrisons, on 19 June. The 167th was a weak, inexperienced formation. However, the 167th's parent unit, Höheres Kommando XXXXV, had obtained extra 8.8cm high-velocity guns, which had proven particularly effective against Maginot positions in other sectors. On the 20th the Germans assaulted Bambesch. [...] After an initial infantry assault was repelled, a sustained barrage with 8.8cm guns on Block 2 drove the defenders into the underground galleries. With further attacks on Block 3, the defenders <b>risked</b> <b>entrapment</b> and asphyxiation. Supporting fire from Kerfent was of limited use, since the petit ouvrage did not mount heavy weapons. Bambesch surrendered at 1900 hours. German casualties were six wounded and one dead.|$|R
40|$|Aims: To {{determine}} {{the occurrence of}} pain conditions and disorders in the forearm and to evaluate risk factors for forearm pain in a cohort of computer workers. Methods: A total of 6943 participants {{with a wide range}} of computer use and work tasks were studied. At baseline and at one year follow up participants completed a questionnaire. Participants with relevant forearm symptoms were offered a clinical examination. Symptom cases and clinical cases were defined on the basis of self reported pain score and palpation tenderness in the muscles of the forearm. Results: The seven days prevalence of moderate to severe forearm pain was 4. 3 %. Sixteen of 296 symptom cases met criteria for being a clinical forearm case, and 12 had signs of potential nerve entrapment. One year incidence of reported symptom cases was 1. 3 %; no subjects developed new signs of nerve <b>entrapment.</b> Increased <b>risk</b> of new forearm pain was associated with use of a mouse device for more than 30 hours per week, and with keyboard use more than 15 hours per week. High job demands and time pressure at baseline were risk factors for onset of forearm pain; women had a twofold increased risk of developing forearm pain. Self reported ergonomic workplace factors at baseline did not predict future forearm pain. Conclusion: Intensive use of a mouse device, and to a lesser extent keyboard usage, were the main ris...|$|R
25|$|The Anzio beachhead is at {{the northwestern}} end of a tract of {{reclaimed}} marshland, formerly the Pontine Marshes, now the Pontine Fields (Agro Pontino). Previously uninhabitable due to mosquitoes carrying malaria, in Roman times armies marched {{as quickly as possible}} across it on the military road, the Via Appia. The marsh was bounded on one side by the sea and on others by mountains: the Monti Albani, the Monti Lepini, the Monti Ausoni and further south the Monti Aurunci (where the allies had been brought to a halt before Monte Cassino). Overall these mountains are referenced by the name Monti Laziali, the mountains of Lazio, the ancient Latium. Invading armies from the south had the choice of crossing the marsh or taking the only other road to Rome, the Via Latina, running along the eastern flanks of the Monti Laziali, <b>risking</b> <b>entrapment.</b> The marshes were turned into cultivatable land in the 1930s under Benito Mussolini. Canals and pumping stations were built to remove the brackish water from the land. These canals divided the land into personal tracts with new stone houses for colonists from north Italy. Mussolini also founded the five cities destroyed by the battle.|$|R
40|$|For {{applications}} in which unmanned vehicles must traverse unfamiliar terrain, there often exists the <b>risk</b> of vehicle <b>entrapment.</b> Typically, this <b>risk</b> {{can be reduced}} by using feedback from on-board sensors that assess the terrain. This work addressed the situations where a vehicle has already become immobilized or the desired route cannot be traversed using conventional rolling. Specifically, {{the focus was on}} using push-pull locomotion in high sinkage granular material. Push-pull locomotion is an alternative mode of travel that generates thrust through articulated motion, using vehicle components as anchors to push or pull against. It has been revealed through previous research that push-pull locomotion has the capacity for generating higher net traction forces than rolling, and a unique optical flow technique indicated that this {{is the result of a}} more efficient soil shearing method. It has now been found that pushpull locomotion results in less sinkage, lower travel reduction, and better power efficiency in high sinkage material as compared to rolling. Even when starting from an "entrapped" condition, push-pull locomotion was able to extricate the test vehicle. It is the authors' recommendation that push-pull locomotion be considered as a reliable back-up mode of travel for applications where terrain entrapment is a possibility...|$|R
