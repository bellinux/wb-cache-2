40|$|Fabric {{properties}} such as pilling and {{abrasion resistance}} and tensile strength vary when <b>greige</b> <b>fabric</b> is processed further. The quality of dyed fabric {{depends on the}} quality of <b>greige</b> <b>fabric.</b> Cotton Plain and Twill weave fabrics were woven at three different warp yarn tension and then dyed using monochlorotriazine, Drimerene Red Cl- 5 B dye gives difference in fabric properties. The ASTM, American International Standards were used to determine the greige and dyed fabric properties. It has been observed fabric woven at proper loom setting or warp yarn tension have high strength, less pilling and abrasion tendency as compared to fabric woven at variant warp yarn tension. Moreover, fabric tenacity is decreased after dyeing whereas, slight difference in pilling and abrasion values is observed after dyeing than that of <b>greige</b> <b>fabric...</b>|$|E

Commercial available polyester, polyester-cotton and cotton plain woven fabrics were treated with fluropolymer and found that polyester and cotton twill fabrics have high protection (Midha et al. 2014). To apply both antimicrobial and flurochemical repellent finishes to nonwoven surgical gown fabrics, a one-bath process was investigated by Huang and Karen (2007). Etching of fabrics with functional groups from a gas based plasma treatment can impart functionality, such as grafting polar surface groups to impart hydrophilicity on a hydrophobic fibre surface. There have even been studies conducted on <b>greige</b> <b>fabric</b> treated with plasma and research was made to allow <b>greige</b> <b>fabric</b> to be dyed without the requirement of fabric preparation such as desizing, scouring, and bleaching. The research found that exposing a <b>greige</b> <b>fabric</b> to plasma altered the surface so that it became hydrophilic. Through the formation of polar groups on the fabric surface, during plasma treatment, the increas hydrophilicity was studied for use in pretreating textiles (Gawish et al. 2008; Rajpreet et al. 2004).|$|E

40|$|Control of {{the warp}} and weft yarn tension is an {{important}} factor. In this research, effect of warp yarn tension variations {{on the quality of}} greige and dyed woven fabrics was investigated. Six fabric samples (three Plain and three Twill weaves) were woven on shuttle loom at varied warp yarn tension. The fabric samples were then pre-treated and dyed (Drimarene Red Cl 5 B, 3 % owf) using laboratory singeing machine and HT dyeing machine. <b>Greige</b> <b>fabric</b> quality such as fabric inspection, fabric length, fabric width, GSM (Gram per Square Meter), EPI (Ends per Inch), PPI (Picks per Inch), and dyed fabric quality such as L*, a*, b*, C, h o, (K/S) ?max and fastness properties were assessed according to the standard. It has been observed that fabric samples, both Plain and Twill weave; woven at improper warp yarns tension gives rejected <b>greige</b> <b>fabric</b> quality and 1 - 7 % lower (K/S) 550 nm values as compared to the fabric weave at requisite warp yarn tension such as 38 - 39 cN for Plain fabric and 78 cN for Twill fabric for 42 x 38 and 64 x 36 tex construction. Hence, among other weave faults, warp yarn tension variation has influence on the <b>greige</b> <b>fabric</b> quality as well as caused improper and uneven dyeing behavior...|$|E
40|$|The {{effects of}} {{different}} percentages of elastane and Nylon yarn on the dimensional and physical properties of elastanelNylon Locknit warp knitted fabrics are investigated. In order {{to investigate the}} properties ofthe fabric, four different samples were knitted by selecting four different run-in ratios of elastane and Nylon. Elastane yarn was kept at a constant elongation of 65 % for all four samples. Two samples were produced keeping constant run-in of nylon yarn and changing the run-in length of elastane yarn. Then elastane yarn run-in was kept constant and produced two other samples. The sample with minimum run-in length of elastane yarn and the highest run-in ratio has the highest value of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in length direction and the lowest values of load at 20 %, 40 %, 60 % and 80 % extensions in width direction. This {{is due to the}} fact that low run in of elastane yarn increases the strain on the yarn and it increases the tightness factor value of the sample and contributes higher load at extension along the length direction of the greige sample. Nylon yarn runner length influences the relaxation behavior of elastane yarn and it leads to reduce the load at extension along the width direction of the sample. Changing of Nylon yarn runner length influence the relaxation behavior of elastane yarn and it has an effect on the load at different extension in width direction and course density of the <b>greige</b> <b>fabric.</b> Results revealed that the effect of elastane content of the sample is more on the load at extension values than the effect of run-in of the Nylon yarn...|$|E
40|$|In {{order to}} facilely achieve {{pretreatment}} and salt-free dyeing of <b>greige</b> knitted cotton <b>fabrics,</b> a combinative scouring, bleaching, and cationization pretreatment of the fabrics is designed in this study. The fabrics are first {{treated in a}} bath containing commercial scouring and bleaching agents, and then glycidyltrimethylammonium chloride (GTA) is directly added into the bath to achieve cationization of the fabrics. Utilization of the alkaline and high-temperature conditions in scouring and bleaching process, cationization can facilely proceed in a short time. Optimal pretreatment conditions are as follows: <b>greige</b> knitted cotton <b>fabrics</b> are treated in a bath containing 4 g/L scouring agent and 6 g/L 30 % hydrogen peroxide at 90 °C for 60 min, and then 30 g/L GTA and 3 g/L sodium hydroxide are added in the bath for another 15 min treatment. Fiber performances, including whiteness, water absorptivity, diffusion time, and capillary effect, are tested and evaluated. X-ray diffraction analysis, surface morphology, and thermal analysis of the pretreated cotton are also investigated and compared with that treated only with scouring and bleaching agents. Much higher dye fixation and color yield could be realized on the pretreated cotton in salt-free reactive dyeing. Colorimetric properties of the dyes are studied and good colorfastness of the dyes on the cationic fabrics are obtained. All of the above results show promising prospects of this combinative pretreatment in real application...|$|R
40|$|Enzymatic {{bio-processing}} {{of cotton}} generates significantly less hazardous, readily biodegradable wastewater effluents, yet having several critical shortcomings, such as expensive processing costs and slow reaction rates, which impedes its acceptance at an industrial level. Our research {{showed that the}} introduction of a low-energy, uniform ultrasound field in enzyme-processing solutions greatly improved enzyme efficiency by significantly increasing their reaction rate. It has been established that the following specific features of combined enzyme/ultrasound bio-processing of cotton are critically important: a) the cavitation effects caused by {{the introduction of a}}n ultrasound field in the enzyme processing solution greatly enhance the transport of enzyme macromolecules towards the substrate surface, b) the mechanical impact, produced by the collapse of the cavitation bubbles, provides an important benefit, that of “opening up ” the surface of the solid substrates to the action of enzymes, c) the effect of cavitation is several hundred times higher in heterogeneous (solid substrate-liquid) than in homogeneous systems, and d) in water, the maximum effects of cavitation occur at ~ 50 °C, which is the optimum temperature for many industrial enzymes. At a laboratory scale, the introduction of ultrasonic energy in the reaction chamber during enzymatic bio-preparation of <b>greige</b> cotton <b>fabrics</b> and enzymatic bio-conversion of cotton gin and cotton lint waste biomass in sugars resulted in a significant improvement in enzyme efficiency...|$|R
40|$|In this research, the {{desizing}} and scouring stages {{were eliminated}} by mercerizing <b>greige</b> cotton <b>fabrics</b> for 5 min at different temperatures ranging from 15 to 90 °C in both slack and under tension states. Mercerization {{is one of}} the most common wet processing of cotton materials to improve their dyeing and physical properties following changes in fine structure, morphology and conformation of the cellulose chains occur during mercerization. The barium activity number was used to express the degree of mercerization of the mercerized fabrics. The ratio of IR peak heights (α 1372 cm - 1 /α 2900 cm - 1) obtained from treated fabrics was used to measure crystallinity index of mercerized cotton fabrics at various temperatures. It was observed that mercerization treatments decrease the cellulose crystallinity index where decrement in crystallinity index was varied in different mercerization conditions. Mercerization at low temperatures could increase dye uptake. Maximum dye uptake increase was observed at 35 °C for slack mercerized fabrics and at 65 °C for tension mercerized fabrics which were about 34 and 28. 2 % compared to un-mercerized fabric respectively. Also, these findings evidenced that tensile strength could be improved in mercerization process, whereas the increase of the tensile strength of tension mercerized fabric was small as compared to that of the slack mercerized fabric...|$|R
40|$|Wettable {{nonwoven}} topsheets {{are traditionally}} spunbond polypropylene nonwoven fabrics. The fluid handling performance of hydroentangled greige cotton nonwovens was studied {{to determine their}} suitability for topsheet applications based upon analysis of fluid rewet, strikethrough, and acquisition properties; and the relative contributions of nonwoven cotton’s cellulosic and wax components to hydrophobic and hydrophilic fluid transport properties are addressed. It was observed that mechanically cleaned greige cotton nonwovens exhibit certain fluid handling properties {{that are similar to}} polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets, {{partly as a result of}} the residual wax content. Subsequently, the surface polarity, swelling, and moisture uptake of 100 % greige cotton and 50 : 50 blends of greige cotton and polypropylene hydroentangled nonwovens were studied in comparison with the performance of a commercially available 100 % polypropylene spunbond-meltblown topsheets. The surface polarity, swelling, and wettability values obtained from electrokinetic and water contact angle analysis were found to be in agreement with the hydrophobic polypropylene topsheets. Additionally, comfort assessment was undertaken based upon fabric handle profiles using the Leeds University Fabric Handle Evaluation System, which is an objective evaluation based on the quantification of fabric buckling deformations. Of the fabrics studied in this work, 50 : 50 <b>greige</b> cotton/polypropylene hydroentangled <b>fabrics</b> were the softest as determined by the Leeds University Fabric Handle Evaluation System and exhibited fluid handling properties consistent with the requirements of commercial topsheets...|$|R
40|$|Shibori {{processes}} {{can be used}} {{to generate}} highly-textured surface designs for the production of pure silk garments that permanently retain their form and elasticity. Fabric is first shaped using a variety of traditional stitch-resist shibori techniques on <b>greige</b> goods (untreated <b>fabric)</b> of Japanese Gunma silk, a special fabric with highly over-spun silk filaments. Next, fabric is scoured, causing it to shrink – an effect of the high-twist yarns. In unprotected areas, the textile is permanently pleated, whereas the remaining stitch-resisted and protected areas of the fabric become permanently textured. Texture can further be enhanced 0 through shibori dyeing. A major consideration in designing garments using the method described above {{is the fact that the}} scouring process leads to a sixty percent reduction in the total surface area of the textile. Therefore, it is necessary to calculate how and where this reduction will occur before scouring in order to ensure that the multiple textures and specific design features (i. e. cuffs, collars and waistline), appear at the appropriate and designated positions within the final piece. This technique, unlike that of traditional garment design, involves multiple textures within a continuous piece [...] no seams exist between the pleated and stitch-resisted areas. Collectively, the elasticity inherent in the final pieces, coupled with their seamless nature, results in extraordinary fluidity and new possibilities in design...|$|R
40|$|Shibori, a {{compression}} {{resist dyeing}} technique, has increasingly {{become part of}} our textile vocabulary and for over 25 years, I have explored these techniques in my own production of fabrics for clothing and interior wall pieces. The {{opportunity to work with}} silk <b>greige</b> goods (untreated <b>fabric)</b> and the possibilities with shibori - together, this combination expands the shibori vocabulary with exciting possibilities for the studio artist and designer. In my application, I use arashi shibori, itajime clamp resist, and nui-shibori stitch resist on the raw yardage. The cloth is simmered in a solution of 10 % (of dry weight of silk) soda ash. The resulting fabric emerges with patterned areas of soft silk where scoured, flat crisp areas where resisted. Through experimentation I have found that certain dyes take differently to scoured and non-scoured areas, thereby further enhancing this difference. Textural contrasts add to the dynamics of the finished cloth. While silk organza may be resist-scoured, the Japanese crepe from Gunma prefecture is the one fabric that has given the most subtle and complex results. The scoured crepe shrinks radically, the resisted areas remain flat, and as a result the fabric will pleat conforming to the resist method — it may be ironed flat but will re -pleat under water! I propose to share slides of my working process and finished fabrics and clothing, and to concisely describe my scouring and dyeing methods. Through this, I hope to share my experience and enthusiasm for this new approach to shibori and silk...|$|R
