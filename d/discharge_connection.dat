40|$|This {{invention}} {{relates to}} tanks in which liquids are stored {{and from which}} said liquids are delivered, usually at atmospheric pressure. When such tanks are subject to angular displacement or to changes in acceleration as in an aircraft, {{it has been found}} difficult to maintain continuous liquids discharge therefrom, as the discharge outlet of such a tank may be partly or wholly uncovered from time to time, or the depth of the liquid above the outlet may vary widely. It is the general object of my invention to provide a construction in a liquid storage tank which will effect continuous liquid discharge from the tank in any angular position of the tank or under substantial changes in acceleration or deceleration. To the attainment of this general object, I provide a plurality of separate discharge valves, together with means for opening each valve when submerged and when in a definite relation to the mass of liquid in the tank. I also provide a construction by which the liquid which passes out through all of the valves is discharged from the tank through a single <b>discharge</b> <b>connection.</b> [URL]...|$|E

Often, joints between high-current bus sections have precisely-machined matching surfaces that are silver-plated to reduce the contact resistance. At extra high voltages (more than 300 kV) in outdoor buses, corona <b>discharge</b> around the <b>connections</b> becomes a source of radio-frequency interference and power loss, so special connection fittings designed for these voltages are used.|$|R

40|$|An annular {{centrifugal}} contactor pilot plant incorporating 30 stages of commercial 5 cm CINC V- 02 units {{has been built}} and operated at INL during the past year. The pilot plant includes an automated process control and data acquisitioning system. The {{primary purpose of the}} pilot plant is to evaluate the performance {{of a large number of}} inter-connected {{centrifugal contactor}}s and obtain temperature profile measurements within a 30 -stage cascade. Additional solvent extraction flowsheet testing using stable surrogates is also being considered. Preliminary hydraulic testing was conducted with all 30 contactors interconnected for continuous counter-current flow. Hydraulic performance and system operational tests were conducted successfully but with higher single-stage rotor speeds found necessary to maintain steady interstage flow at flowrates of 1 L/min and higher. Initial temperature profile measurements were also completed in this configuration studying the performance during single aqueous and two-phase counter-current flow at ambient and elevated inlet solution temperatures. Temperature profile testing of two discreet sections of the cascade required additional feed and <b>discharge</b> <b>connections.</b> Lamp oil, a commercially available alkane mixture of C 14 to C 18 chains, and tap water adjusted to pH 2 were the solution feeds for all the testing described in this report. Numerous temperature profiles were completed using a newly constructed 30 -stage centrifugal contactor pilot plant. The automated process control and data acquisition system worked very well throughout testing. Temperature data profiles for an array of total flowrates (FT) and contactor rpm values for both single-phase and two-phase systems have been collected with selected profiles and comparisons reported. Total flowrates (FT) ranged from 0. 5 - 1. 4 L/min with rotor speeds from 3500 - 4000 rpm. Solution inlet temperatures ranging from ambient up to 50 ° C were tested. Ambient temperature testing shows that a small amount of heat is added to the processed solution by the mechanical energy of the contactors. The temperature profiles match the ambient temperature of the laboratory but are nearly 10 ° C higher toward the middle of the cascade. Heated input solution testing provides temperature profiles with smaller temperature gradients and are more influenced by the temperature of the inlet solutions than the ambient laboratory temperature. The temperature effects of solution mixing, even at 4000 rpm, were insignificant in any of the studies conducted on lamp oil and water...|$|R
40|$|International audience[1] Terrestrial gamma-ray flashes (TGFs) {{have been}} {{correlated}} with an early development stage of high altitude positive intracloud (+IC) flashes {{in which the}} negative leader propagates up toward the upper positive charge region, while the positive leader propagates down toward the lower negative charge region. The resultant bidirectional leaders develop electrical potential differences {{in the vicinity of}} their heads with respect to the ambient potential distribution created by the thundercloud charges. These potential differences are believed to be of essential importance for the generation of TGFs. Using electrostatic calculations and a three-dimensional Cartesian fractal model, we quantify these potential differences produced in a developing +IC lightning discharge for given thunderstorm electric configurations. We present a case of a +IC lightning discharge in a realistic thunderstorm configuration that leads to a very high ($ 300 MV) potential difference and show how a delay {{in the development of the}} negative leader with respect to the positive one in a bidirectional leader system can facilitate a high potential difference in the negative leader head region.

40|$|The {{geometry}} of the inlet has a significant bearing on the relationship headwater elevation and discharge for culverts with a free outlet. The relative importance of inlet design depends upon {{the location of the}} control section. The primary purpose of the research reported here was to examine the effect of inlet design upon the head-discharge curve of a model culvert. Two types of flush inlets, selected to represent extreme conditions for flush inlets, were tested [...] a square-edged inlet and a well rounded inlet. For each inlet the head-discharge curve was measured and the two curves compared. The comparison indicated that for certain conditions an appreciable head-advantage was gained by using a rounded inlet. Observation and analysis of the flow characteristics indicated that this gain phenomenon occurred in the region where for the same head a square-edged inlet caused separation and inhibited full flow, while the rounded inlet promoted full flow in the culvert with a corresponding increase in <b>discharge.</b> In <b>connection</b> with measurements to establish friction factors and entrance losses in the model culvert for use in the analysis of the experimental, a few behavior curves were determined. An analysis of behavior curves is included in Appendix IV. The results obtained were compared with experimental curves and other published curves.

Although originally <b>discharged,</b> his <b>connection</b> to the light was soon exploited by BSCT in hopes of killing The One, a monster with a similar origin to Maki. When The One attacked BSCT's headquarters, it was then when Maki transformed into The Next in Anphans, successfully fending off against The One before it retreated. Maki reverted to himself after exhausted and chastised the team for using him as a life bait, though one of them, Sara stated that he was fated to be The One's enemy due to his inheritance of the strange light, dubbed as [...] "The Next". Although BSCT offered Maki to assist them, he refused and wished {{to spend more time}} with his son. Promising the boy to take a flight with him again, Maki finally joined the BSCT in pursuing The One. When The One grew into a gigantic monster, Maki transformed into The Next and this time evolved into Junis, capable of fighting in a more stabilized form and finally put an end to The One's assaults by killing him with Evol Ray Storm. The Next severed his bonds with Maki and gave him another life force to fulfill his promise on taking his son to a flight.|$|R

40|$|This report {{provides}} information about environmental programs during 2004 at the Stanford Linear Accelerator Center (SLAC). Seasonal activities that span calendar years are also included. Production of an annual site environmental report (ASER) {{is a requirement}} established by the United States Department of Energy (DOE) for all management and operating (M&O) contractors throughout the DOE complex. SLAC is a federally-funded, research and development center with Stanford University as the M&O contractor. The most noteworthy information in this report is summarized in this section. This summary demonstrates the effective application of SLAC environmental management in meeting the site's integrated safety management system (ISMS) goals. For normal daily activities, all SLAC managers and supervisors are responsible for ensuring that proper procedures are followed so that worker safety and health are protected; the environment is protected; and compliance is ensured. Throughout 2004, SLAC focused on these activities through the SLAC management systems (described in Chapter 3). These systems were also the way SLAC approached implementing ''greening of the government'' initiatives such as Executive Order 13148. The management systems at SLAC are effective, supporting compliance with all relevant statutory and regulatory requirements. There were no reportable releases to the environment from SLAC operations during 2004. In addition, many improvements were continued during 2004, in waste minimization, recycling, decreasing air emission rates, stormwater drain system, groundwater restoration, and planning for a chemical management system to manage chemical use better. Program-specific details discussed are: (1) Air Quality [...] SLAC operates its air quality management program in compliance with its established permit conditions: 2004 was the seventh consecutive year the air quality management program operated without receiving any notices of violation (NOVs) from regulators. (2) Hazardous Waste [...] The Environmental Health Division of the San Mateo County Health Services Agency is the California certified unified permitting agency (CUPA) responsible for overseeing hazardous materials and waste management at SLAC. The CUPA made no facility inspections of SLAC during 2004. (3) Stormwater and Industrial Wastewater [...] SLAC operates its industrial and sanitary wastewater management program in compliance with established permit conditions: 2004 was the eighth consecutive year the program operated without receiving any NOVs from program regulators. During 2004 the last 32 unauthorized <b>discharge</b> <b>connections</b> to the stormwater system were eliminated. (4) Hazardous Materials Program [...] Although SLAC {{has been successful in}} meeting the regulatory requirements for managing hazardous materials, it has decided to pursue a more active strategy in reducing its use of such materials. The cornerstone of this effort is the implementation of a chemical management system (CMS). (5) Environmental Radiological Program [...] In 2004, no radiological incidents occurred that increased radiation levels or released radioactivity to the environment. In addition to managing its radioactive wastes safely and responsibly, SLAC worked {{to reduce the amount of}} waste generated. As detailed in Chapter 5, SLAC has implemented programs and systems to ensure compliance with all radiological requirements related to the environment. (6) Groundwater Protection and Environmental Restoration [...] In general, environmental concerns at SLAC are limited in number, small in scale and are actively being managed or eliminated. The Environmental Restoration Program continued work on site characterization and evaluation of remedial alternatives at four sites with volatile organic compounds (VOCs) in groundwater and several areas with polychlorinated biphenyls (PCBs) and lead in soil...|$|R
40|$|Gwinnett County has {{implemented}} several Illicit <b>Discharge</b> and Illegal <b>Connection</b> (IDIC) identifi-cation {{programs that}} have proven effective in identifying discharges of pollutants to stormwater drainage systems.

40|$|The {{possibility}} of using negative corona discharge in pure nitrogen as the ionization source for negative ion mobility spectrometry (IMS) has been investigated. The discharge in pure nitrogen produces {{a huge number}} of electrons, almost 106 times as much as that produced by the conventional 63 Ni ionization source. However, this high intensity electron source cannot be simply used in IMS since introducing any electronegative substance in the corona region immediately results in quenching of the <b>discharge.</b> In this <b>connection,</b> a special IMS cell has been designed and optimized to employ this intense electron source without being disturbed by sample. With this design, the electron current received at the detector plate could be as high as 200 nA. The ionization efficiency and the collection efficiency of the electrons and negative ions, as a function of electric field at different regions, have been evaluated. As practical examples, the IMS spectra of CHCl 3, CHBr 3, CH 3 I and nitrobenzene, as well as the explosive materials pentaerythritol tetranitrate (PETN) and trinitrotoluene (TNT) at elevated temperatures have been obtained. Finally, the capability of the method in quantitative analysis of CHCl 3 has been evaluated and a detection limit of 10 ng/m 3 and a linear range of five orders of magnitude were obtained.

40|$|Large wood {{maintains}} in-channel and floodplain habitats by {{influencing the}} biophysical {{character of the}} river corridor. Large wood dynamics in a river corridor are a product of both watershed-wide processes but also of local recruitment, transport, and storage. This complexity of scales added to the logistical constraints in taking measurements limits our understanding of large wood dynamics through the watershed. To begin to unravel this issue, we compiled a dataset {{of the volume of}} large wood deposited annually into 131 reservoirs across Japan, and compared large wood export to both flow discharge and watershed characteristics (watershed size, latitude, channel slope, percent forest, and forest type). We found that large wood was predominately transported during peak flow events. Large wood export increased logarithmically with watershed area. The decreasing export rate of large wood per watershed area is interpreted as a combination of annual export variability in upper watersheds, a non-significant increase in large wood recruitment along the longitudinal gradient (potentially human influenced), the increase in long-term storage on adjacent large floodplains, and significant decay/fragmentation downstream. Watersheds < 10 - 20 km 2 had a highly variable large wood export pattern, conforming generally to previously published work that suggest transport limitation in smaller watersheds. The data suggest that there is an export threshold (∼ 75 km 2) where large wood export is no longer related to watershed size. Export across all watershed sizes was controlled by watershed characteristics (slope, percent forested, etc.) and peak <b>discharge</b> events. The <b>connection</b> with upstream watersheds and laterally with the floodplain increases the net flux of large wood through downstream transport and retransport of buried logs. Identifying rates of large wood transport due to watershed connectivity as a potential key input process will improve our basic understanding of geomorphic and ecological patterns within the watershed. These results highlight the importance of understanding both the local and watershed scale dynamics of large wood in creating and maintaining more heterogeneous riparian and aquatic habitat along the river corridor...|$|R
40|$|Proceedings of the 2007 Georgia Water Resources Conference, March 27 - 29, 2007, Athens, Georgia. The new {{millennium}} brought many new changes, and stormwater management {{was no exception}} in the State of Georgia. The {{new millennium}} has effected change in many arenas, {{not the least of}} which is stormwater management. Minimum compliance is no longer the standard, and stormwater is no longer an afterthought for community planning. For example: 2001 – The State of Georgia completed its Stormwater Management Manual (GSMM), providing a methodology for selecting and implementing Best Management Practices (BMPs) for new development, in accordance with the goal of improving water quality through reduced sediment loads. 2003 – Nationally, Phase II of the National Pollutant Discharge Elimination System program led cities and counties (86 in Georgia) to develop stormwater management programs. 2006 – Stringent measures in the Etowah River Basin were adopted through the Etowah Habitat Conservation Plan to prevent the “taking” of several endangered darters. Over the past few years in the Atlanta metropolitan area, the Metropolitan North Georgia Water Planning District (MNGWPD) developed six model stormwater management ordinances, addressing post-development stormwater management, floodplain management, conservation subdivision / open space development, illicit <b>discharge</b> and illegal <b>connections,</b> litter control, and stream buffer protection. The paper focuses on causes, effects, and remedies leading to the establishment and refinement of administrative procedures, professional trust, proactive approaches, and the elimination of plan implementation obstacles. As a community, we must pool our resources to help enable a positive return on our endeavors. The goal is not only to continually improve the protection and restoration of our streams and watersheds, but also to improve the process. Sponsored and Organized by: U. S.

40|$|The current {{need for}} {{forecasting}} Greenland Ice Sheet contributions to global sea level rise {{is complicated by}} the lack of understanding of ice sheet hydrology. The proportion of meltwater contributing to sea level rise, as well as the pathways transporting meltwater on, through, and out of the ice sheet, are not well understood. Remote sensing of hydrologic dynamics in combination with small-scale fieldwork allows examination of broad spatial and temporal trends in the Greenland hydrologic system responding to a changing climate. This dissertation reviews the current state of knowledge on Greenland Ice Sheet hydrology, and examines three components of the Greenland hydrologic system: (1) fjord sediment plumes as an indicator of meltwater output, (2) supraglacial streamflow as an indicator of meltwater input to the ice sheet, and (3) moulin distribution and formation as a mechanism diverting meltwater {{from the surface of the}} ice sheet to the bed. Buoyant sediment plumes that develop in fjords downstream of outlet glaciers are controlled by numerous factors, including meltwater runoff. MODIS retrievals of sediment plume concentration show a strong regional and seasonal response to meltwater production on the ice sheet surface, despite limitations in fjords with rapidly calving glaciers, providing a tool for tracking meltwater release to the ocean. Summertime field observations and high-resolution satellite imagery reveal extensive supraglacial river networks across the southwestern ablation zone transporting large volumes of meltwater to moulins, yet these features remain poorly mapped and their discharges unquantified. A GIS modeling framework is developed to spatially adapt Manning’s equation for use with high-resolution WorldView- 2 imagery to map supraglacial river <b>discharge.</b> Moulins represent <b>connections</b> between surface meltwater on the Greenland ice sheet and subglacial drainage networks, where increased meltwater can enhance ice sliding dynamics. A new high-resolution moulin dataset in western Greenland created from WorldView- 1 / 2 imagery in the 2012 record melt year is used to assess moulin distribution and formation. Moulin locations show a significantly different distribution compared to geospatial variables in the entire study area, with moulins forming in areas of thinner ice, higher velocity and extensional strain rate, as well as lower surface elevation and slope, and higher bed elevation and slope...|$|R
