50|$|Good {{style is}} a {{subjective}} matter, and {{is difficult to}} define. However, there are several elements common to {{a large number of}} programming styles.

5000|$|Just as in {{standard}} mathematical usage, {{the argument is}} thus the actual input passed to a <b>function,</b> <b>procedure,</b> or routine, whereas the parameter is the variable inside {{the implementation of the}} subroutine.

50|$|The {{main idea}} of an RPC is to allow a local {{computer}} (client) to remotely call procedures on a different computer (server). The client and server use different address spaces, so parameters used in a <b>function</b> (<b>procedure)</b> call have to be converted, otherwise the values of those parameters could not be used, because pointers to parameters in one computer's memory would point to different data on the other computer. The client and server may also use different data representations, even for simple parameters (e.g., big-endian versus little-endian for integers). Stubs perform {{the conversion of the}} parameters, so a remote procedure call looks like a local function call for the remote computer.|$|E

The radial basis <b>function</b> <b>procedure</b> is used to transform partial differential equations, which represent the dynamic behavior of wind turbine blades, into a discrete eigenvalue problem. Numerical results demonstrate that rotational speed significantly impacts the first frequency of a wind turbine blade. Moreover, the pitch angle does not markedly affect wind turbine blade frequencies. This work examines the radial basis functions for dynamic problems of wind turbine blade...|$|E

40|$|Penalty {{function}} {{methods have}} several disadvantages. The main ones are as follows: (1) The methods are time-consuming. They~do require multiple solving of unconstrained minimization sub-problems; (2) Solution of minimization sub-problems becomes exceedingly cumbersome when the penalty coefficient increases, since a minimization function becomes ill-conditioned; (3) The usual penalty methods {{cannot be used}} for determining a solution with great accuracy. These methods are subject to numerical instabilities because the derivatives of the penalty functions increase without bound near the solution as computation proceeds. The methods suggested in this paper essentially simplify standard penalty <b>function</b> <b>procedure</b> and remove, to some extent, the first two shortcomings...|$|E
40|$|The control {{function}} approach (Heckman and Robb (1985)) {{in a system}} of linear simultaneous equations provides a convenient procedure to estimate one of the functions in the system using reduced form residuals from the other functions as additional regressors. The conditions on the structural system under which this procedure can be used in nonlinear and nonparametric simultaneous equations has thus far been unknown. In this note, we define a new property of functions called {{control function}} separability and show it provides a complete characterization of the structural systems of simultaneous equations in which the control <b>function</b> <b>procedure</b> is valid. ...|$|E
