5|$|On 7 November, Udin's family {{announced}} {{their intention to}} sue the city for <b>improper</b> <b>use</b> of evidence. This announcement followed a report from police chief Mulyono that Udin's blood had been disposed of in the southern sea off Parangtritis Beach as an offering to Nyai Roro Kidul, the area's deity, to ensure quick resolution of the investigation. Marsiyem's lawyers from the Legal Aid Institute (Lembaga Bantuan Hukum) filed a case in January 1997 against the police (national, provincial, and local), and Edy Wuryanto. The lawsuit demanded Rp. 1 million (US$36,400) in damages. The police countered that the blood had been given voluntarily, and that Marsiyem hoped to exploit the situation.|$|E

5|$|An acute {{exacerbation}} (a sudden worsening of symptoms) {{is commonly}} triggered by infection or environmental pollutants, or sometimes by other {{factors such as}} <b>improper</b> <b>use</b> of medications. Infections {{appear to be the}} cause of 50 to 75% of cases, with bacteria in 25%, viruses in 25%, and both in 25%. Environmental pollutants include both poor indoor and outdoor air quality. Exposure to personal smoke and secondhand smoke increases the risk. Cold temperature may also play a role, with exacerbations occurring more commonly in winter. Those with more severe underlying disease have more frequent exacerbations: in mild disease 1.8 per year, moderate 2 to 3 per year, and severe 3.4 per year. Those with many exacerbations have a faster rate of deterioration of their lung function. Pulmonary emboli (blood clots in the lungs) can worsen symptoms in those with pre-existing COPD. Signs of PE in COPD include pleuritic chest pain and heart failure without signs of infection.|$|E
5|$|Class III {{dollars are}} {{identical}} to the Class II dollar, except lettering similar to that on the Class I dollars {{was applied to the}} edge of the coins. Based on the slightly concave appearance of the Class III dollars, it is likely that all were given edge lettering at some point after striking; as the Castaing machine was meant to be used prior to striking, its <b>improper</b> <b>use</b> resulted in a deformation of the coin surface. Newman and Bressett assert that they were struck at approximately the same time as the Class II dollars, and that the edges were lettered and the coins concealed by Mint employees until 1869, when one was offered to a coin collector, who rejected it as a restrike. However, numismatist S. Hudson Chapman believed that some Class III dollars were struck as late as 1876. In 1875, several were sold by Philadelphia coin dealer John W. Haseltine. Six specimens of the Class III dollar are known today.|$|E

The study is going to answer why the land is decreasing, how it is converted to non-agricultural uses and what might be the consequences for <b>improper</b> <b>uses</b> of agricultural land. In Bangladesh most of the people live in rural areas and makes Bangladesh predominantly rural. The development in rural seems development of agriculture. But the agricultural land is decreasing day by day. Poverty, rapid population growth, <b>improper</b> <b>uses</b> of land, lack of interest in agriculture, conventional system of irrigation, Real Estate companies etc are playing a critical role for decreasing agricultural land. Besides this, a nature itself is also responsible for land degradation. Flood, drought and salinity due to climate change are very common in Bangladesh thus the result is land degradation. As a result, soil fertility, crop productivity, and food security might be seriously in danger. But it is important to keep full of life this sector for land-scarce country like Bangladesh or else the consequences might be terrible. Food insecurity, unsustainable environment, economic downturn, agricultural productivity decrease and social decay etc are the important matters to consider.   Key words: Land degradation, Agriculture, Land Zonin...|$|R

Birds in hangars are in proximity to the airfield and their droppings are both a health and damage concern. Netting is often deployed across the superstructure of a hangar denying access to the rafters where the birds roost and nest while still allowing the hangar doors to remain open for ventilation and aircraft movements.

Pain beyond the first week, severe pain, cracking, fissures or localized swelling is not normal. The mother should see a doctor for further evaluation. Sore nipples, a common cause of pain, often come from the baby not latching on properly. Factors include too much pressure on the nipple when not enough of the areola is latched onto and an improper release of suction {{at the end of the}} feeding. <b>Improper</b> <b>use</b> of breast pumps or topical remedies can also contribute.

25|$|The Hongwu Emperor of the Ming dynasty {{emulated}} the Yuan dynasty {{rules on}} the use of the dragon motif and decreed that the dragon would be his emblem and that it would have five claws. The four-clawed dragon would become typically for imperial nobility and certain high-ranking officials. The three clawed dragon was used by lower ranks and the general public (widely seen on various Chinese goods in the Ming dynasty). The dragon, however, was only for select royalty closely associated with the imperial family, usually in various symbolic colors, while it was a capital offense for anyone—other than the emperor himself—to ever use the completely gold-colored, five-clawed Long dragon motif. <b>Improper</b> <b>use</b> of claw number or colors was considered treason, punishable by execution of the offender's entire clan.

40|$|Abstract Because of {{its strong}} {{physical}} meaning, the decomposition of a symmetric second-order tensor into a deviatoric and a spheric part is heavily used in continuum mechanics.

But, considering the actual literature, the situation seems to be a bit messy: definitions vary according to authors, <b>improper</b> <b>uses</b> of denomination flourish, and, at the end, the understanding of the physics contained in third-order tensors remains fuzzy. The aim {{of this paper is to}} clarify the situation. Using few tools from group representation theory, we will provide an unambiguous and explicit answer to that problem. ...|$|R
