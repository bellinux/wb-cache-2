2500|$|As {{part of the}} post-September 11 drive towards {{increased}} capability in {{homeland security}} and public health preparedness, traditional GC-MS units with transmission quadrupole mass spectrometers, {{as well as those}} with cylindrical ion trap (CIT-MS) and toroidal ion trap (T-ITMS) mass spectrometers have been modified for field portability and near real-time detection of chemical warfare agents (CWA) such as sarin, soman, and VX. [...] These complex and large GC-MS systems have been modified and configured with resistively heated low thermal mass (LTM) <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> that reduce analysis time to less than ten percent of the time required in traditional laboratory systems. [...] Additionally, the systems are smaller, and more mobile, including units that are mounted in mobile analytical laboratories (MAL), such as those used by the United States Marine Corps Chemical and Biological Incident Response Force MAL and other similar laboratories, and systems that are hand-carried by two-person teams or individuals, much ado to the smaller mass detectors. [...] Depending on the system, the analytes can be introduced via liquid injection, desorbed from sorbent tubes through a thermal desorption process, or with solid-phase micro extraction (SPME).|$|E

50|$|HP Jetdirect {{was first}} {{introduced}} in March 1991 (code named QuickSilver) with the LaserJet IIIsi network printer (code named Eli). Jetdirect is based on HP's MIO (Modular Input/Output) interface, which was designed {{from the ground up}} with the IIIsi to create a mainstream full function high performance networked printer. The initial MIO interface card had Ethernet and Token Ring physical layer variants and used various networking protocols over an AUI/BNC connection. Initially, a printer needed a separate card for each protocol, such as TCP/IP, IPX/SPX, AppleTalk, or DLC/LLC. The following year the team applied the technology to the legacy accessory slot on the LaserJetIIs and IIIs XIO (Extended Input/Output). MIO type Jetdirect cards were also used for network connectivity on some HP/Agilent laboratory equipment such as the 6890A and 6890 Plus series of <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs.</b> These included unusual network connection types such as HPs I-Net which was used as an interconnect between various pieces of hardware that controlled the 58xx and 68xx series <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs.</b> Not until 1994 would MIO interface cards be released that could support more than one protocol per card.|$|E

50|$|Volatile thiols {{are easily}} and almost unerringly {{detected}} by their distinctive odor. S-specific analyzers for <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> are useful. Spectroscopic indicators are the D2O-exchangeable SH signal in the 1H NMR spectrum (33S is NMR-active but signals for divalent sulfur are very broad and of little utility). The νSH band appears near 2400 cm−1 in the IR spectrum. In the nitroprusside reaction, free thiol groups react with sodium nitroprusside and ammonium hydroxide {{to give a}} red colour.|$|E
50|$|Some <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> are {{connected}} to a mass spectrometer which acts as the detector. The combination is known as GC-MS. Some GC-MS {{are connected}} to an NMR spectrometer which acts as a backup detector. This combination is known as GC-MS-NMR. Some GC-MS-NMR {{are connected to}} an infrared spectrophotometer which acts as a backup detector. This combination is known as GC-MS-NMR-IR. It must, however, be stressed this is very rare as most analyses needed can be concluded via purely GC-MS.|$|E
5000|$|Modern {{chemical}} weapon detection is highly automated. One technique involves continual sampling of air through a nondispersive infrared analyzer. More complex instrumentation, such as <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> coupled to mass spectrometers, are standard laboratory techniques {{that need to}} be modified for the field.

IMS cells have since been attached to many other mass spectrometers, <b>gas</b> <b>chromatographs</b> and high-performance liquid chromatography setups. IMS is a widely used technique, and improvements and other uses are continually being developed.|$|E
