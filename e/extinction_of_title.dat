50|$|The <b>title</b> <b>of</b> Earl of Torrington {{was created}} {{twice in the}} Peerage of England. The first {{creation}} was in 1660 as a subsidiary <b>title</b> <b>of</b> the Duke of Albemarle.

50|$|The Counts of Ribeira Grande (Condes de Ribeira Grande) was a <b>title</b> <b>of</b> nobility {{granted to}} a {{hereditary}} line of nobles {{from the island}} of São Miguel in the Portuguese archipelago of the Azores, most {{closely associated with the}} Gonçalves da Câmara familial line. The title was first conferred to D.

When Lord Leith died in 1925 without male heir, thus resulting in the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>title,</b> Burn changed his name by deed poll to Charles Forbes-Leith of Fyvie {{and was able to}} inherit the family seat of Fyvie Castle.|$|R
50|$|In November, formal {{complaints}} were made against Bingham for having provoked the rebellion, but a declaration {{was signed by}} 43 Mayo gentleman {{to the effect that}} the cause of the rebellion had been the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the MacWilliam <b>title</b> and the suppression of exactions to be replaced with a central composition. The charges against Bingham, as brought before the Dublin council, were dismissed as malicious in February 1587.|$|R
50|$|In 1678, Churchill married Sarah Jennings (1660-1744), a courtier and {{influential}} favourite of the queen. They had seven children, of whom four daughters married {{into some of}} the most important families in Great Britain; one daughter and one son died in infancy. He was pre-deceased by his son, John Churchill, Marquess of Blandford, in 1703; so, to prevent the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>titles,</b> a special Act of Parliament was passed. When the 1st Duke of Marlborough died in 1722 his title as Lord Churchill of Eyemouth in the Scottish peerage became extinct and the Marlborough titles passed, according to the Act, to his eldest daughter Henrietta (1681-1733), the 2nd Duchess of Marlborough. She was married to the 2nd Earl of Godolphin and had a son who predeceased her.|$|R

By 1897 the mortgage debt on the Welsh properties had increased to £87,600, as the loan had not been repaid on its due date. In order to repay the loan, the Porthaml estate was sold in 1913 and the Pembrey estate in 1922. Thomas Ashburnham died without issue on 12 May 1924, leading to the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the Ashburnham <b>title.</b>|$|R

Oghy O’Hanlon, ‘chief and captain of his nation’ surrendered his territories in “Upper and Nether Orrye” on 20 September 1587. A new patent was issued on 1 December 1587, whereby O’Hanlon was confirmed in his lands for life, then to his heirs male, failing those, to his brothers. At the same time, Sir Oghie agreed to maintain twelve footmen called kerne and eight horsemen, all well armed, to attend upon the Lord Deputy, or other Governor of Ulster, in all hostings and risings and to maintain them in food and all necessities. Significantly the document also provided for the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the <b>title,</b> The O’Hanlon <b>of</b> Orior. Sir Oghie agreed to pay the Queen £60 per year.|$|R
50|$|On {{leaving the}} Senate in 1893, Dawes became {{chairman}} of the Commission to the Five Civilized Tribes (the Dawes Commission) and served in this capacity for ten years. He negotiated with the tribes for the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the communal <b>title</b> to their land and for {{the dissolution of the}} tribal governments, with the object of making the tribes a constituent part of the United States. Native Americans lost about 90 million acres (360,000 km²) of treaty land, or about two-thirds of their 1887 land base, {{over the life of the}} Dawes Act. About 90,000 Indians were made landless. The Act forced Native people onto small tracts of land distant from their kin relations. The allotment policy depleted the land base and ended hunting as a means of subsistence, creating a crisis for many tribes.|$|R
50|$|The {{church and}} the Jansenists {{condemned}} the production of Esther {{and the lack of}} discipline which seemed to reign at Saint-Cyr, adding that girls' education should not be entrusted to lay people. Moreover, it was held to be incongruous that the Maison was a secular house, not a convent, and yet was financed by revenues from the Abbaye de Saint-Denis. Although neither Madame de Maintenon nor the king wanted the Maison to become a convent, she admitted that her attempt at secular education at Saint-Cyr had failed and accepted its transformation into a convent. Thus, in November 1692, the pope pronounced the <b>extinction</b> <b>of</b> the abbatial <b>title</b> <b>of</b> Saint-Denis, and the Maison's transformation into a convent was decided on in September 1692 - the pope's request was made via Godet des Marais: The conversion became effective from 1 December and the teachers were given the choice between taking solemn vows and thus becoming nuns, and leaving the Maison altogether. From 1692 to 1694, mother Priolo, from the Chaillot convent, was put in charge of their teaching during their time as novices.|$|R
