5|$|Any Canadian citizen or {{corporate}} body can petition for {{a grant of}} new arms or registration of existing arms. In general, eligibility for a grant of arms {{is based on an}} individual's contributions to the community, although the exact criteria for grants or registrations have not been published. A number of grants have been made to people who have already been recognized with state honours for their notable achievements, such as through admission to the Order of Canada, and who are accordingly <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> grant of arms. Those who are Companions of the order may also request the chief herald to grant them supporters.|$|E

5|$|As Kinkladze was {{not playing}} regular {{international}} football {{when he signed}} for Derby, he was not automatically <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> work permit, but a review panel gave him special dispensation, due to his previous contribution to English football. He made his debut on 28 November 1999, coming on {{as a substitute for}} Avi Nimni in a 1–2 loss against Arsenal, the first of 14 loan appearances. He scored his first Derby goal on 4 March 2000 in a 4–0 win against Wimbledon. At the end of the season, the loan move was made permanent. The transfer fee of £3 million set a club record that stood until 2007.|$|E
5|$|Hitler named Grand Admiral Karl Dönitz as his successor. Himmler met Dönitz in Flensburg {{and offered}} himself as second-in-command. He {{maintained}} {{that he was}} <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> position in Dönitz's interim government as Reichsführer-SS, believing the SS {{would be in a}} good position to restore and maintain order after the war. Dönitz repeatedly rejected Himmler's overtures and initiated peace negotiations with the Allies. He wrote a letter on 6 May—two days before the German Instrument of Surrender—formally dismissing Himmler from all his posts.|$|E
5|$|In February 2012 the Standards in Public Office Commission {{published}} the candidates' returns for campaign donations and election expenses.

Three candidates received the maximum refund allowed; the other four had too few votes and received no refund. Only donations above €638 need be reported, making the reported totals less meaningful.

5|$|In his High Court appeal Dietrich was {{represented}} by David Grace, QC. The main argument advanced on Dietrich's behalf was that his trial was a miscarriage of justice, since {{he did not have}} legal representation. He argued that he should have been provided with counsel at public expense, given the seriousness of the crime with which he was charged. Alternatively, he argued that the judge should have stayed or adjourned the trial until he was able to obtain counsel himself. His argument was based on the common law tradition that an accused is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair trial.|$|E
5|$|Months later, the Washington State Department of Health's Office of Counselor Programs {{administratively}} charged Ahn {{with professional}} misconduct. As {{this was an}} administrative proceeding which culminated in a hearing before an administrative law judge conducted over the telephone, rather than a criminal proceeding before a Superior Court judge, Ahn was not <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> public defender in the event he could not afford a lawyer. Concerned {{he would not be}} able to adequately represent himself pro se against a seasoned state attorney, he entered an Alford plea and agreed to a ten-year revocation of his counselor registration.|$|E
5|$|Smith {{suffered}} a heart attack on 9 August 1961, at his home in Washington, D.C., and he died in the ambulance on the way to Walter Reed Army Hospital. Although <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> Special Full Honor Funeral, at the request of his widow, a simple joint service funeral was held, patterned after the one given to General Marshall in 1959. She selected a grave site for her husband in Section 7 of Arlington National Cemetery close to Marshall's grave. Mrs. Smith was buried next to him after her death in 1963. Smith's papers are in the Eisenhower Presidential Center in Abilene, Kansas.|$|E

5|$|The {{defendant}} {{may move}} to dismiss a criminal charge {{on the ground}} that he or she has been singled out for prosecution because of race, gender, religion, national origin, illegitimacy, or similar. In order to get discovery on a racial selective prosecution claim, the defendant must make the threshold showing that the government declined to prosecute similarly situated suspects of other races. The defendant is not <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> presumption of selective prosecution based on data regarding the overall population of convicts.|$|E
5|$|While a {{defendant}} is <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> fair cross {{section in the}} venire, the defendant is not guaranteed a fair cross section in the actual grand jury or petit jury. Yet, the equal protection clause does regulate the use of peremptory challenges {{in the selection of}} the petit jury from the venire. In the landmark case of Batson v. Kentucky (1986), the Supreme Court reversed a criminal conviction because of the prosecutor's racially motivated use of peremptory challenges.|$|E
5|$|Ahead of {{the opening}} of the IPO, {{concerns}} were raised among both investors and Manchester United supporters regarding the details of the share offering. Although the share prospectus specified that the proceeds from the sale would go towards paying down the club's debts, it was revealed that much of the money would go directly to the Glazers. Furthermore, holders of class A shares would not be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>a</b> regular dividend, and the structure of the share issue meant that the Glazers' class B shares had 10 times the voting power of class A shares, essentially denying a controlling interest in the club to anyone but the Glazers. These issues drove down interest and forced a drop in the share price from the planned $16–20 each to $14 each, representing a potential total sale value of $233million (£150million).|$|E
5000|$|The {{entertainment}} tax exemption {{request for the}} film was denied {{on the basis that}} the filmmakers misspelled the English title as [...] "Gethu" [...] instead of [...] "Kethu", the latter being the correct transliteration of a Tamil word. Government officials argued that since films released using Tamil words are <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> {{entertainment tax}}, and that [...] "Gethu" [...] is not a Tamil word, the film would not be <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> exemption. The matter was heard by the Madras State Court, which ruled that the film was <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> the entertainment tax exemption.|$|R

50|$|Students from low-income {{households}} may {{qualify for}} an increased maintenance loan and/or maintenance grant (for every £1 of maintenance grant received the maintenance loan entitlement reduces by £0.50). For the 2009/2010 academic year, students {{living at home}} were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> extra £1,075 (bringing the total loan to £3,838); students living in London were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> extra £1,940 (bringing the total loan to £6,928); and students living elsewhere in the UK were <b>entitled</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> extra £1,386 (bringing the total loan to £4,950). The precise threshold for qualifying as a low-income household varies depending on which country of the UK the student resides in, and is set between two bands, with very poor students receiving the full extra money and less-poor students receiving only a partial extra amount.|$|R
