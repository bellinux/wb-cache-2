The archeological record of this hunter-gatherer connection is poorly documented, however, {{and as a result}} the early agricultural revolution in north China is not as well understood as those that occurred {{in other parts of the}} world. The Laoguantai site of Dadiwan, in the western Loess Plateau, Gansu Province, PRC, furnishes the first complete record of this transition, which unfolded quite differently from other, better known, agricultural revolutions...|$|E
40|$|Double-{{cropping}} millet and legumes is {{a popular}} cropping system in the Upper East region (UER) of Ghana. For improved production efficiency, suitable millet-legume combinations with short life cycles that permit extension of the growing season to facilitate double-cropping need to be explored. The objective {{of this study was}} therefore to use performance data to identify millet-legume combinations compatible for relay cropping within the UER. Three <b>early</b> <b>millet</b> cultivars (Bongo Shorthead, Arrow Millet and Bristled Millet) were factorially relayed by three legumes namely cowpea, groundnut and soybean. Bongo Shorthead followed by cowpea in a relay cropping system has the greatest prospect of accounting for superiority in grain and stover/straw yield while Bongo Shorthead followed by groundnut in a relay will provide the least suitable combination for relay cropping within the Upper East Region of Ghana...|$|E
40|$|Phosphorus (P) {{deficiency}} {{is a major}} constraint to {{pearl millet}} (Pennisetum glaucum L.) growth on acid sandy soils of the West African Sahel. To develop cost-effective fertilization strategies for cash poor farmers, experiments with pearl millet were conducted in southwestern Niger. Treatments comprised single superphosphate hill-placed at rates of 1, 3, 5 or 7 kg P ha^− 1 factorially combined with broadcast P {{at a rate of}} 13 kg ha^− 1. Nitrogen was applied as calcium ammonium nitrate at rates of 30 and 45 kg ha^− 1. At low soil moisture, placement of single superphosphate in immediate proximity to the seed reduced seedling emergence. Despite these negative effects on germination, P placement resulted in much faster growth of millet seedlings than did broadcast P. With P application, potassium nutrition of millet was improved and seedling nitrogen uptake increased two- to three-fold, indicating that nitrogen was not limiting <b>early</b> <b>millet</b> growth. Averaged over the 1995 and 1996 cropping seasons, placed applications of 3, 5 and 7 kg P ha^− 1 led to 72 %, 81 % and 88 % respectively, of the grain yield produced by broadcasting 13 kg P ha^− 1. Nitrogen application did not show major effects on grain yield unless P requirements were met. A simple economic analysis revealed that the profitability of P application, defined as additional income per unit of fertilizer, was highest for P placement at 3 and 5 kg ha^− 1...|$|E
50|$|Proso millet is a {{relatively}} low-demanding crop and diseases are not known; consequently, proso millet is often used in organic farming systems in Europe. In the United States it is often used as an intercrop. Thus, proso millet can help to avoid a summer fallow, and continuous crop rotation can be achieved. Its superficial root system and its resistance to atrazine residue make proso millet a good intercrop between two water- and pesticide-demanding crops. The stubbles of the last crop, by allowing more heat into the soil, result in a faster and <b>earlier</b> <b>millet</b> growth. While millet occupies the ground, because of its superficial root system, the soil can replenish its water content for the next crop. Later crops, for example, a winter wheat, can in turn benefit from the millet stubble, which act as snow accumulators.|$|R
30|$|The {{discovery}} {{of a large number}} of carbonized and charred millet grains from the NKLE site is especially noteworthy (Tsang and Li 2015). Because no <b>earlier</b> <b>millet</b> grains were ever found archaeologically in Taiwan, this discovery is apparently of great importance and significance, assuming that prehistoric people in Taiwan at 5000  BP probably already knew how to grow these plants, and the mode of their subsistence was no longer limited to hunting and gathering. This assumption seems to gain its support not only from direct evidence of millet grains and indirect evidence such as the types of tools used for agricultural activities at that time. The most distinguishing tools are shell knives. The knives were formed by cutting and polishing shells that are relatively flat and thin. On comparison with ethnographical records, these shell knives were probably used as a kind of grain-harvesting tool (Tsang and Li 2015).|$|R

40|$|Mighty baobab Professor Gordana Kanjac-Berisavljevic Sustainable Land Management, Ghana Suggested {{introduction}} Of all African trees, {{perhaps the}} baobab {{is the most}} wonderful. These mighty trees can live {{for as long as}} five thousand years. The baobab has provided us with food for generations. In fact its seeds were found in the stomach of a man who lived on earth thirty thousand years ago. This shows that this tree has long been an important source of food. But despite its long history, eating the baobab has been going out of fashion. However there are signs it is making a comeback, with growing demand in European markets and in semi-arid areas of Africa. Professor Gordana is team leader of a sustainable land management project in northern Ghana. She is enthusiastic about baobab, and she explained to Benedict Komba where in Ghana, and when, the baobab is especially important. Track 3 In	?In northern parts of Ghana? Out	?improve life of the rural people. ? Duration	 4 ? 04 ? Suggested closing announcement: A report on the baobab tree, which has many uses and can live for more than 5000 years. Contact details: Professor Gordana Kanjac-Berisavljevic Vice-Dean Faculty of Agriculture University for Development Studies, Tamale, P. O. Box TL 1882 N, Ghana Email:gordanak@gmail. com Transcript Berisavljevic	In northern parts of Ghana very close to Burkina Faso there is a hungry period every year between January and June. A hungry season means that people subsist on two meals a day and they reduce to only one. It is in June, towards the end, that <b>early</b> <b>millet</b> is harvested and then the diet improves but before that period it is really very difficult and people collect products from the wild. Komba	How can baobab help to feed people in Ghana? Berisavljevic	We have evidence of research for over seventy years that in these particular poor rural communities baobab is always used to support feeding, as part of the diet in this hungry season. This is when all parts of the baobab tree are used to supplement the diet. Komba	May you describe the nutrients that can be available in baobab? Berisavljevic	Baobab is very rich in vitamins. It is now increasingly becoming a medicinal plant. The European market is highly interested in imports of baobab and there are already very strict regulations on what baobab products are to be imported. Particularly interesting is the pulp from the fruit, which is dried and used in a variety of energy drinks, snacks. Komba	And if a person wants to know how does a baobab tree look like, how can you describe it? Berisavljevic	It is probably the largest tree in your environment, it can be five metres wide and it is very old. It normally, some people describe it as having roots upside, up in the air, when there are no leaves on it. It can live up to 5, 000 years and is generally available everywhere in sub-Saharan Africa in drier environment. Komba	Which parts of the baobab are mostly used? Berisavljevic	In our communities where I did my study people use everything, they use each and every part of the tree. The bark is used as the firewood for local beer production. Roots are used for medicinal and spiritual purposes. The fresh leaves are used as a sauce, dry leaves are sold, fruit is eaten fresh as a snack. Pulp is dried and then added to the local staple food, and seeds are cracked and mixed with the local leafy vegetable. So there is really no part that is not useful in the traditional system. Komba	If we come to the fruits themselves, how do they look like? Are they so big or so small and what about their seeds? Berisavljevic	They are not too big, they are not too small, their size is maybe comparable to the smaller types of papaya in size. And they are a little bit difficult to crack but inside is a delicious pulp, which especially children like as a snack. That pulp surrounds seeds which are more or less black and then they are also used. Komba	And how do the seeds or the fruits taste? Berisavljevic	They taste very nice. They can be added to ice cream, and then the people also use it for porridge, for traditional meals and so on. Nobody complains about the baobab flavour! It is very nice. Komba	It seems that this baobab is among those neglected plants, {{so what do you do}} in your country to popularise it? Berisavljevic	Yes we are trying to show people that they can add value and process and export this product because there is a lot of market and then that will probably improve life of the rural people. End of track. The baobab tree has been used by man as a source of food and other materials for tens of thousands of years. In some parts of Africa, such as northern Ghana, the leaves, seeds and fruit pulp are a vitamin rich supplement to diets, particularly during the hungry season. The roots are also valued for their medicinal properties and there is growing interest in baobab products in the European market. As such, baobab deserves attention, having potential for adding value, processing and exporting of products, thereby boosting local economies...|$|E

5|$|Millet cultivation: The {{discovery}} in northern China of domesticated varieties of broomcorn and foxtail millet from 8500 BC, or <b>earlier,</b> suggests that <b>millet</b> cultivation might have predated that of rice {{in parts of}} Asia. Clear evidence of millet began to cultivate by 6500 BC at sites of Cishan, Peiligang and Jiahu. Archaeological remains from Cishan sum up to over 300 storage pits, 80 with millet remains, with a total millet storage capacity estimated for the site of about 100,000kg of grain. By 4000 BC, most Yangshao areas were using an intensive form of foxtail millet cultivation, complete with storage pits and finely prepared tools for digging and harvesting the crop. The success of the <b>early</b> Chinese <b>millet</b> farmers is still reflected today in the DNA of many modern East Asian populations, such {{studies have shown that}} the ancestors of those farmers probably arrived in the area between 30,000 and 20,000 BP, and their bacterial haplotypes are still found in today populations throughout East Asia.|$|R

40|$|Selection {{of drought}} adapted genotypes and {{efficient}} use of water {{are among the most}} important goals in the breeding programs. In order to study drought tolerance of three important species of millets, Proso millet (Panicum miliaseum), Foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and Pearl millet (Pennisetum americanum) were planted in a split-plot design with two irrigation treatments (well watered and 50 % of irrigation requirement) and four replications in Birjand Agricultural Research Station, Iran. Deficit irrigation declined yield by reduction of seed number per ear and ear number per plant. This reduction was greater in Proso millet than the other two species. In addition, although, drought stress caused a reduction in WUE of Proso millet, it increased WUE in the other ones. Harvest index also reduced in the presence of drought stress due to of both seed per ear and per plant reduction. Tillering started <b>earlier</b> in Proso <b>millet</b> than the other millets. Although, stem elongation started <b>earlier</b> in foxtail <b>millet</b> than the other millets, but its ear was emerged very late.

If the castor was sown after the harvest of mungbean in a sequential system the profits were less than from a sole castor system. Relay-sowing the castor 20 days before the harvest of mungbean gave 9 US ha− 1 greater profit than sole castor, but this is probably not enough to justify the more intensive double crop system. On the other hand a reasonable yield of horsegram (Macrotyloma uniflorum) could be produced after an <b>early</b> pearl <b>millet</b> crop, giving a worthwhile extra profit of 21 US ha− 1 compared with sole pearl millet.

The residual effect of B at 10 kg. ha- 1, increased Fe, Cu and B contents of plant by 2 %, 1. 4 % and 65. 6 %, respectively. While no significant effect was noted with respect to plant Zn content. Irrespective of Zn and B availability, application of residual organic matter significantly increased Fe, Zn, Cu and B contents of plant.

30|$|The {{first is}} the <b>early</b> spread of <b>millet</b> {{agriculture}} to the highlands of the Hengduan mountain range {{to the west and}} the south and the Qinling mountain range {{to the north of the}} Sichuan Basin and the Tibetan Plateau. Current evidence suggests that this spread occurred from Northwest China ca 3500 BC or earlier. The second is the spread of rice and foxtail millet agriculture to the undulating hills of the Sichuan Basin itself, specifically to the large level area of the Chengdu Plain in the Northwest portion of the Basin. Here, a system of rice and foxtail agriculture appears suddenly in sites of the Baodun culture ca 2700 BC. Combined rice and foxtail millet formed a perfect packet for agricultural expansion, thanks to their versatility and capacity for intensification and potential to reduce risk. From this area, rice and foxtail millet agriculture spread rapidly into Yunnan, possibly Guizhou, and ultimately into Southeast Asia.|$|R
50|$|Foxtail Millet {{is known}} to have been the first domesticated millet. Chinese legends {{attribute}} the domestication of millet to Shennong, the legendary Emperor of China. Similarly, millets have been mentioned in some of the oldest extant Yajurveda texts, identifying foxtail millet (priyangava), Barnyard millet (aanava) and black finger millet (shyaamaka), indicating that millet consumption was very common, pre-dating to 4500 BC, during the Indian Bronze Age. Specialized archaeologists called palaeoethnobotanists, relying on data such as the relative abundance of charred grains found in archaeological sites, hypothesize that the cultivation of millets was of greater prevalence in prehistory than rice, especially in northern China and Korea. Millets also formed important parts of the prehistoric diet in Indian, Chinese Neolithic and Korean Mumun societies. Broomcorn (Panicum miliaceum) and foxtail millet were important crops beginning in the Early Neolithic of China. For example, some of the <b>earliest</b> evidence of <b>millet</b> cultivation in China was found at Cishan (north). Cishan dates for common millet husk phytoliths and biomolecular components have been identified around 8300-6700 BC in storage pits along with remains of pit-houses, pottery, and stone tools related to millet cultivation. Evidence at Cishan for foxtail millet dates back to around 6500 BC. A 4,000-year-old well-preserved bowl containing well-preserved noodles made from foxtail millet and broomcorn millet was found at the Lajia archaeological site in China.|$|R
40|$|It is {{generally}} recognized that millet agriculture originated in northern China. However, the domestication process of foxtail millet (Setaria italica) and broomcorn millet (Panicum miliaceum) is still poorly understood. Based on statistical and morphological analyses of ancient millet starch grains, a tangible hypothesis {{has been proposed}} for the long-term domestication of green foxtail millet (S. viridis). However, the hypothesis requires validation by evidence from more regions and more archaeological finds. The West Liaohe region {{is one of the}} <b>earliest</b> regions of <b>millet</b> cultivation. Here, we report ancient starch grains recovered from 12 stone grinding tools from eight sites of the Xiaohexi culture (before 8. 5 ka BP), Xinglongwa culture (8. 2 - 7. 4 ka BP), Zhaobaogou culture (7. 0 - 6. 4 ka BP), and Hongshan culture (6. 5 - 5. 0 ka BP) in the West Liaohe region of China. Our results indicate that the proportion of millet starch grains with wrinkled surfaces and rough edges, which are diagnostic of wild millet grasses, decreased from 13. 0 % to 3. 4 % from the Xiaohexi culture to the Hongshan culture. Millet starch grains measuring > 16. 8. m, a size class recorded only in domesticated foxtail millet, increased from 55. 0 % to 62. 1 %. These millet data imply that the process of millet domestication in the West Liaohe region began in the Xiaohexi period and continued up to the Hongshan period...|$|R
40|$|Pearl millet {{plays an}} {{important}} role for food security in arid regions of Africa and India. Nevertheless, it lags far behind other cereals in terms of genetic improvement. Improving its root system could improve pearl millet tolerance to abiotic constraints (drought and low nutrient availability) and lead to a significant increase in production. The objective of this work is to characterize pearl system root system development in order to produce knowledge for breeding, mainly targeted on tolerance to drought stress occurring at the early growth stages. First, we described the dynamics of <b>early</b> pearl <b>millet</b> root system development and the anatomy of the different root types. This work revealed the existence of three anatomically distinct types for lateral roots. We also showed the existence of variability in primary root growth and lateral root density in a diversity panel derived from cultivated varieties. Our study also revealed a large variability among the growth profiles of lateral roots. To further analyze this diversity, the growth rates {{of a large number of}} lateral roots were measured daily and a statistical model was developed to classify these lateral roots into three main trends, according to their growth profiles. These three categories distinguish roots according to their growth rate and their growth duration. These different lateral root types are randomly distributed along the primary root and there seem to be no influence of root types on the intervals between successive lateral roots. The three growth types correspond, though imperfectly, to the three anatomical types evidenced in the first chapter. A similar work has been performed on maize, which was used to compare these two phylogenetically close cereals. Finally, we initiated the search for genetic markers associated to primary root growth, a trait potentially involved in early drought stress tolerance. A large panel of genetically fixed pearl millet inbred lines was phenotyped, confirming the presence of a large variability existing for this trait. These lines were then genotyped by sequencing. Analyses of association between phenotype and genotype are underway. This work provides a precise description of pearl millet root system that was little studied to date. Our data were used for parameterization and testing of functional structural plant models simulating root growth and water transport. The statistical tool developed for the characterization of the different lateral root growth types is an original approach that can be used on other cereals. Finally, results from our association study will reveal new information on the genetic control of root growth and open the way to marker assisted selection for root traits in pearl millet.

40|$|Graduation date: 1988 Wild {{proso millet}} (Panicum miliaceum L.) {{is a serious}} weed {{recently}} infesting sweet corn fields in the Willamette Valley of western Oregon. Field and greenhouse experiments were conducted to determine the importance of seed depth {{in the position of}} the growing point of wild proso millet seedlings and in the performance of five herbicides. The effects of atrazine (6 -chloro-N-ethyl-N'-(1 - methylethyl) - 1, 3, 5 -triazine- 2, 4 -diamine) and tridiphane (2 -(3, 5 - dichloropheny 1) - 2 -(2, 2, 2 -trichloroethyl) oxirane) combinations and alachlor (2 -chloro-N-(2, 6 -diethylphenyl-N-(methoxymethyl) acetamide) soil placement on wild proso millet control were also studied. Shallow seed depths (0 and 3 cm) resulted in more seedlings with the growing point above the soil surface than deeper depths. Mesocotyl length was also directly influenced by seed depth. Wild proso millet emerged from the deepest seed placement which was 15 cm. Seedlings from seeds deeper than 6 cm emerged slower than from shallower seeds. In the first field experiment, seed depth did not influence the performance of alachlor, atrazine, tridiphane, pendimethalin (N-(1 - ethylpropy 1) - 3, 4 -dimethy 1 - 2, 6 -dinitrobenzenamine), and EPTC (S-ethyl dipropyl carbamothioate). In the second field experiment, seed depth influenced the performance of these herbicides. Pendimethalin (2. 0 kg/ha), atrazine + tridiphane (1. 1 + 0. 5 kg/ha), alachlor (2. 2 kg/ha), and EPTC + dichlormid (3 kg/ha) were less effective at 1 cm than at 6 or 11 cm wild proso millet seed depth. Higher rates of the same herbicides were more effective on plants from seeds at 1 cm than from either 6 or 11 cm. This suggests that higher rates are needed to control wild proso millet from shallow seeds. Perhaps the growing point above the soil surface is reducing the effectiveness of soil applied herbicides on wild proso <b>millet.</b> <b>Early</b> postemergence applications of atrazine (0. 56, 0. 84, 1. 68, and 2. 24 kg/ha) and tridiphane (0. 28, 0. 56, and 0. 84 kg/ha) alone and in combinations decreased wild proso millet dry weight and height. Plants treated with atrazine or tridiphane alone did not differ in height or dry weight. There was synergism in the atrazinetridiphane combinations. Shoot exposure was more damaging to wild proso millet seedlings than root exposure at the three alachlor rates used (0. 1, 0. 5, and 1. 0 ppm). Shoot or both shoot and root exposure caused equal reductions in height or dry weight of wild proso millet. These results indicate that alachlor should remain in the shoot region of emerging seedlings for best wild proso millet control...|$|R
40|$|When corn {{or other}} crops fail to grow {{on account of}} {{defective}} seeds, cut worms or other causes; it is necessary frequently to plant something else as a substitute, which will ripen before frosts. But the list of crops which can be grown in Iowa as substitutes in suchcases, is very short. The millets, buck-wheat or beans, are used for such purposes generally; but they have proved failures much oftener than corn, oats, barley or clover. I have grown such crops frequently, not as substitutes for other crops; but because they were profitable. I intend to grow {{them in the future}} also, but I will be careful to select the best varieties for seed, and prepare the ground for them properly. Hungarian grass and, (the weed) Fox-tail, belong to the millet family. Last spring, we planted a large collection of millets which we procured from many different sources. They were billed to us as Hungarian grass, Common millet, German. millet, Pearl millet and Golden Wonder millet. When they were fully grown, the differences between the varieties proved to be great; but not greater than the differences between the plants which were grown from the seeds that were received in each of a considerable number of packages, which were labeled German millet. The seeds in a few of them were nearly pure or true to name; while the plants from the seeds of others showed from twenty-five to fifty variations between Fox-tail and German millet. The Pearl millet lacks vitality and proved a failure on our grounds last year and this year. The common millet is a week earlier than Hungarian grass and two weeks <b>earlier</b> than German <b>millet.</b> Its average heighth on good ground is from 31 / 2 to 4 feet, and its stalks are slender and liable to be blown down by storms. Its blades are very thin and narrow; it is smothered frequently in old fields by Fox-tail and other weeds, and it yields only about half as much hay per acre as German millet. The principal distinctions between Hungarian grass and common millet are, that the former is later and larger than the latter. Neither of them are profitable crops, except on rich, clean ground. The average heighth of German millet is about four feet. Its stalks are so large and strong, that it stands up much better during rain storms than wheat, oats or oarley. Its blades are long, very thick and from 3 / 4 to 1 inch in width. It produces from three to four tons of nutritious hay per acre usually on good ground, and the chinch bugs let it alone; while they are extremely fond of the smaller and earlier varieties. As it is the best of the annual grasses I saved a peck of seeds from carefully selected stalks, to which I expect to add improvements by similar selections of seeds in the future...|$|R
30|$|In {{recent years}} {{there has been}} an {{explosion}} of archaeobotanical research in China, and methodologically there have been major improvements such as the collection and study of spikelet bases (Fuller et al. 2009, 2010 a). Four regions have emerged as candidates for early cultivation of rice (shown in Fig.  1): the Middle Yangtze, the Huai River and southwest Henan, the Houli culture of Shandong and the Lower Yangtze. Unfortunately these regions are not equal in terms of hard evidence, and it remains the case that only the Lower Yangzte has published morphological and quantitative evidence for the domestication process as it happened, and only for {{the latter half of the}} process (Fuller and Qin 2010). Other regions may have been places where wild rice was collected, where it was under pre-domestication cultivation, or even where selection for domestication traits was taking place, but we simply do not know. Some regions may have been dead ends in relation to the traditions of rice agriculture and the genetic lines that persist to this day. This is very likely the case for Shandong where the few finds show no continuity in later cultures (the Beixin and <b>early</b> Dawenkou are <b>millet</b> focused, with rice apparently reintroduced during the Dawenkou period: Song 2011). As for Jiahu, the earliest site with rice on the Huai river (7000 – 6000 BC), we still lack any evidence of spikelet bases, or clear trends of grain shape evolution, or the development of a weed flora, or any clear successor sites—was it a dead end of collectors or early cultivators or something more central to later traditions?—the evidence simply remains unclear. Material culture traits shared with the Yellow River region on the one hand and Yangtze Neolithic on the other may have much to do with this site’s peripheral position to both cultural worlds, rather than indicating some core source of all of China’s Neolithic as Cohen (2011) seems to imply (also contra Sagart 2008). Further to the south and west in Henan, new data from the lowest levels of the site of Baligang do suggest that non-shattering rice was evolving and being cultivated here alongside acorn gathering by ca. 6000 BC (unpublished observations), 1 but the excavations to this level were so limited as to leave material cultural affinities totally unclear. In the middle Yangtze, archaeobotanical evidence is rather more diverse, from Bashidang and Chengtoushan, but we once again lack clear domestication indicators. Cultivation is clear from the weed flora at Chengtoushan, ca. 4300 – 3800 BC (Nasu et al. 2011), and the cultivation system does appear to differ from that of later Hemudu or Majiabang cultures (cf. Fuller and Qin 2009). I tend to favour a diffuse and multi-centric model in which parallel processes of early rice cultivation began de novo in more than one part of China, a position which derives from an emphasis on archaeological cultural differences between regions which are more or less contemporary and the lack of clear evidence for any intensive interaction or trade, but this is not to deny some underlying cultural affinity along the lines of more ancient shared Palaeolithic traditions based on cooking pots and understandings of bodily substance (Fuller and Rowlands 2009, 2011). This appears to be similar to the better known case of the Near East in which early cultivation and the appearance of domesticates appears to be a diffuse process across a wide region rather than focused on any one core region (Willcox 2005; Allaby et al. 2010; Fuller et al. 2011 c, d). In the Near East, this was built upon a much older shared tradition of grain-grinding, flour-based foods and roast meats (Fuller and Rowlands 2009, 2011).|$|R
