Three different fuel blends of Jatropha methyl ester with high speed diesel (HSD) (B 10, B 20) and B 100 were used with producer gas obtained from the gasification of briquettes made from de-oiled Jatropha seed cake. The increments in load on the engine increased the brake thermal efficiency, exhaust gas temperature and lowered the brake specific energy consumption.

40|$|In recent years, {{rapid growth}} in population, development, and {{industrialization}} {{have led to a}} high demand for energy worldwide. Biofuels from bio-based products can be considered an alternative to fossil fuels used in the transport sector. However, the use of biodiesel in conventional diesel combustion engines has usually caused lower thermal efficiency and higher in specific fuel consumption. Using alternative fuels and switching to promising combustion technologies such as low temperature combustion (LTC) are reliable approaches to address this issue. This research aims to use biofuels as an alternative energy source for engines operating in reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) <b>dual-fuel</b> combustion <b>mode.</b> In the first stage, a test cell system was developed, which consisted of a single cylinder diesel engine, dynamometer and combustion analyzer system. This was followed by the extensive conversion and integration of the high pressure common-rail injection to the test engine for providing high degree of flexibility in the control of injection parameters. In the second stage, an experimental investigation to study the effects of palm and Jatropha biodiesel fuels on the engine performance, emissions, and combustion characteristics of the converted engine was performed under different load operations. The test fuels included a conventional diesel fuel and eight different blends of palm and Jatropha biodiesel fuels. During the third stage, parametric studies dealing with injection timing and exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) variation by using neat palm biodiesel were performed and compared with baseline diesel. In the final stage, the effects of diesel/ biodiesel strategies on dual-fuel combustion were investigated. This <b>dual-fuel</b> combustion <b>mode</b> proposes port fuel injection of gasoline and direct injection of diesel/ biodiesel fuel with rapid in-cylinder fuel blending. Engine performance, emissions, and cylinder pressure trace were sampled and analyzed under different experiment schemes. The results indicated that the in-house iv developed ECU is capable of real-time control and monitoring of the injection parameters. The second stage experimental results revealed that the biodiesel blended fuels had a significant influence on the brake specific fuel consumption (BSFC) at all the engine load conditions examined. In general, the use of neat and blends of biodiesel resulted in a reduction in brake specific nitrogen oxide (BSNOx), brake specific carbon monoxide (BSCO), smoke emissions, shorter ignition delay (ID), and shorter combustion duration regardless of the load conditions. Besides, the third stage experimental results indicated that both the injection timing and EGR variation had a prominent effect on the engine performance, emissions and combustion characteristics with baseline diesel and neat biodiesel operation. Based on the highest brake thermal efficiency (BTE) and the reasonable NOx level, thus the optimum injection timing is found to be 11 °BTDC for both the baseline diesel and biodiesel operation. Introduction of EGR has effectively reduced the NOx emissions, but has increased the smoke emissions. In the last stage experiment, the results showed that the engine operating under RCCI <b>dual-fuel</b> combustion <b>mode</b> could achieve high efficiency with near zero NOx and smoke emissions...|$|R
40|$|YesDual-fuel HCCI engines allow a {{relatively}} small quantity of diesel fuel {{to be used to}} ignite a variety of fuels such as natural gas or methane in HCCI mode. The gaseous fuel is mixed with the incoming air, and diesel fuel is sprayed into the cylinder by direct injection. Mathematical modelling is used to investigate the effects of parameters such as premixed ratio (fuel ratio) and pilot fuel injection timing on combustion of a dual-fuel HCCI engines. A CFD package is used with AVL FIRE software to simulate dual-fuel HCCI combustion in detail. The results establish a suitable range of premixed ratio and liquid fuel injection timing for low levels of NOx, CO and HC emissions along with a reliable and efficient combustion. <b>Dual-fuel</b> HCCI <b>mode</b> can increase NOx emission with lower premixed ratios in comparison to normal HCCI engines, but it is shown that the NOx emission reduces above a certain level of the premixed ratio.

The technological solution adopted by the manufactures of diesel engines to meet the NOx and particle matter values imposed in the EURO VI regulation relies on using selective catalytic reduction and particulate filter systems, which increases the complexity and cost of the engine. Alternatively, several new combustion modes aimed at avoiding the formation of these two pollutants by promoting low temperature combustion reactions, {{are the focus of}} study nowadays. Among these new concepts, the <b>dual-fuel</b> combustion <b>mode</b> known as reactivity controlled compression ignition (RCCI) seems more promising because it allows better control of the combustion process by means of modulating the fuel reactivity depending on the engine operating conditions. The present experimental work explores the potential of different strategies for reducing the energy losses with RCCI in a single-cylinder research engine, with the final goal of providing the guidelines to define an efficient dual-fuel combustion system.

Maximum thermal efficiency with JO was found as 29 per cent at 31 per cent of orange oil induction at 100 per cent load. Smoke was reduced significantly with all orange oil induction rates at all power outputs in dual-fuel operation with JO.

40|$|Homogeneous charge {{compression}} ignition (HCCI) engine uses {{a relatively new}} mode of combustion technology. In principle, there is no spark plug or injector to assist the combustion, and the combustion auto-ignites in multiple spots once the mixture has reached its chemical activation energy. The challenges in developing HCCI engines are the difficulties in: controlling the auto-ignition of the mixture and the heat release rate at high load operations, achieving a cold start, meeting emission standards and controlling knock. At low engine speeds, early auto-ignition can occur, possibly leading to knocking, while late auto-ignition at high engine speeds will make HCCI susceptible to misfire. Hydrogen greatly reduces emissions levels but with reduced power. However, when hydrogen is combined with diesel in <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>mode,</b> low NOx, CO and particulate matter (PM) emissions levels can be achieved, and engine efficiency can be increased by 13 – 16 %. Numerical methods are commonly used to predict HCCI engines' performance (i. e. emissions levels, brake thermal efficiency and combustion phasing), which is cost-effective compared to solely relying on experimentation. The multi-zone method promises better simulation results compared to the single-zone model by combining detailed chemical kinetics with simplified 3 D modeling so that turbulence and inhomogeneity in the mixture are considered; good agreement between simulations and experiments have been achieved. Specific strategies used in the experimental method (e. g. fuel additives, inlet air heating, inlet air pressurizing, exhaust gas recirculation (EGR) and injection methods), and numerical method (e. g. single-zone and multi-zone models, mixing model, turbulence model and multi-dimensional model), and other issues associated with HCCI engines are discussed in this paper. ...|$|E

From the existing concepts to meet this goal the Diesel-Ethanol in the <b>Dual-Fuel</b> <b>mode</b> has demand for published experimental data. Such concept brings a greater degree of freedom, but implications in technological challenges. It works through a PFI (Port Fuel Injection) system to prepare a pre-mixture of air and ethanol in the intake port which is compressed in the combustion chamber and ignited by pilot injection of diesel. In this work a single cylinder research engine with 100 % electronically controlled calibration was used. The engine control parameters were set to maximize diesel substitution rate by ethanol with a limited indicated efficiency loss. Comparisons were made among different working conditions.

40|$|Currently, {{interest}} in different alternative transport fuels is growing. There {{are two main}} reasons for this motivation: the universal environmental concern, caused by the noticeable impact of petroleum fuels on the human health and environment, {{and the necessity of}} replacement due to the declining availability of petroleum. Dual-fuel engines could mean a partial solution of these worries, since the primary fuel of this type of engines is natural gas, mostly formed by methane, which can derived from both renewable and fossil sources. Diesel consumption is reduced by the introduction of some gas fractions, and <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>mode</b> allows, mainly, fewer greenhouse gas emissions. From the economic and environmental point of view, dual-fuel is, thus, highly desirable. However, from a technical standpoint, this technique has been proved to be difficult to realize and optimize. Therefore, this master’s thesis has the objective to serve as a support on dual-fuel research field, as far as the Exhaust Gas Recirculation (EGR) effect on combustion and emissions performance is concerned.

Based on the results of this master’s thesis it can be concluded that EGR rate raises lead on significant reduction of NOx emissions, as well as a slightly decrease of unburned hydrocarbons.

A single cylinder 10 HP, constant speed, water cooled diesel engine was used for experimentation with B 20 fish diesel as fuel. This study expanded to achieve diesel equivalent performance from diesel engines with maximum replacement of diesel with renewable fuels. In this context the study analysed the influence of B 20 fish biodiesel as a pilot fuel in a biodiesel biogas dual fuel engine.

In general, B 20 fish biodiesel is compatible with diesel in terms of performance and combustion characteristics. The exhaust emissions like CO and HC were significantly less, and NOx is slightly higher, than diesel fuel at all engine load conditions. Dual fuel mode of operations shows lower thermal efficiency and higher fuel consumption for other fuel mode of test run at all ranges of engine loads.

40|$|This work {{concerns}} a systematic study of IC engine operation with 100 % biogas as fuel (as {{opposed to the}} <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>mode)</b> with particular emphasis on operational issues {{and the quest for}} high efficiency strategies. As a first step, a commercially available 1. 2 kW genset engine is modified for biogas operation. The conventional premixing of air and biogas is compared with a new manifold injection strategy. The effect of biogas composition on engine performance is also studied. Results from the genset engine study indicate a very low overall efficiency of the system. This is mainly due to the very low compression ratio (4. 5) of the engine. To gain further insight into factors that contribute to this low efficiency, thermodynamic engine simulations are conducted. Reasonable agreement with experiments is obtained after incorporating estimated combustion durations. Subsequently, the model is used as a tool to predict effect of different parameters such as compression ratio, spark timing and combustion durations on engine performance and efficiency. Simulations show that significant improvement in performance can be obtained at high compression ratios. As a step towards developing a more efficient system and based on insight obtained from simulations, a high compression ratio (9. 2) engine is selected. This engine is coupled to a 3 kW alternator and operated on 100 % biogas. Both strategies, i. e., premixing and manifold injection are implemented. The results show very high overall (chemical to electrical) efficiencies with a maximum value of 22 % at 1. 4 kW with the manifold injection strategy. The new manifold injection strategy proposed here is found to be clearly superior to the conventional premixing method. The main reasons are the higher volumetric efficiency (25 % higher than that for the premixing mode of supply) and overall lean operation of the engine across the entire load range. Predictions show excellent agreement with measurements, enabling the model {{to be used as a}} tool for further study.

40|$|Global {{efforts have}} been devoted to {{developing}} different kinds of alternative fuels {{in order to reduce}} the dependence on conventional petroleum fuels. Among these alternative fuels, the compressed natural gas (CNG) is a pop- ular choice because of its relatively clean combustion and global availability at attractive prices. Biogas is another important alternative fuel due to its renewable characteristics. Fossil CNG fuel normally consists of four com- ponents: methane, ethane, propane and n-butane. Methane as the primary fuel component can represent up to 90 % of the fuel content. The CNG com- position varies from region to region. Biogas normally consists of methane and carbon dioxide. The latter needs to be removed prior to using biogas as a fuel in combustion engines. One of the most attractive approaches for using gas (CNG/biogas) in heavy- duty engines is the <b>dual-fuel</b> <b>mode,</b> which can be realized by small modifi- cations of current heavy-duty engines. The secondary fuel in this mode is Diesel, which is used as an ignition source. In the conventional dual-fuel scenario, gas is port-injected into the intake manifold and premixed with air before entering the cylinder. A Diesel pilot is directly injected into the cylinder to initiate combustion at the end of the compression stroke. Reactivity Controlled Compression Ignition (RCCI), one of the low temper- ature combustion concepts, can also be used with gas/Diesel combinations. Gas can also be port-injected into the intake manifold as in the conventional dual-fuel scenario, but in the RCCI approach, Diesel needs to be directly injected into the cylinder much earlier in the compression stroke than in the conventional dual-fuel scenario. Experiments were carried out for both the conventional dual-fuel and RCCI scenarios. In the conventional dual-fuel scenario, the influence of the CNG supplement ratio on engine performance and emissions was explored at two different load points. The results indicated improved performance and emis- sions at intermediate load compared to those at low load. For the RCCI scenario, the effects of different parameters on the engine performance and emissions were investigated, including the SOI timing, Diesel injection quan- tity, EGR, compression ratio, engine speed and load. The latter test cam- paign revealed that a high indicated thermal efficiency (over 50 %) could potentially be achieved with the RCCI concept. Besides the experimental investigation, dual-fuel simulation work was also performed. To simulate dual-fuel combustion, a new numerical model in- corporating two coupled combustion modes was developed: the Diesel com- bustion mode modeled as a partially premixed reactor and the flame prop- agation mode based on the turbulent flame propagation model. This com- bustion model was implemented in the updated KIVA- 3 V CFD engine code. Validation of this 3 D dual-fuel combustion model was carried out for three different cases by comparing simulation and experimental results. The com- parison showed reasonable good agreement between experiment and simu- lation for most aspects of engine performance but discrepancies regarding the onset of ignition delay and emissions...|$|E
