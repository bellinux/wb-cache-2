30|$|Nickel powders {{are widely}} used as {{electrode}} materials in multilayered ceramic capacitors. The tendency of ceramic and <b>electrode</b> <b>layers</b> thinning to 100 to 200  nm that is used for increasing of capacitor dielectric capacity leads to the necessity of the powder size decreasing to 10 to 20  nm. At the same time, these powders used as electrode materials should fulfill the requirements for morphology, particle size distribution, ability to disperse in organic solvents, and impurity composition. Every one of these characteristics effects properties of conductive paste for screen printing, <b>electrode</b> <b>layers</b> obtained from it, and multilayered ceramic capacitor as a whole.|$|R

This gate electrode is often called [...] "gate metal" [...] or [...] "gate conductor". The geometrical width of the gate conductor electrode (the direction transverse to current flow) is called the physical gate width. The physical gate width may be slightly different from the electrical channel width used to model the transistor as fringing electric fields can exert an influence on conductors that are not immediately below the gate.|$|E
5000|$|The {{cooling method}} {{requires}} {{a very great}} technical effort and is unfavorable for mass production. In the electrochemical polymerization at first an auxiliary <b>electrode</b> <b>layer</b> on the dielectric has to be applied and {{to be connected to}} the anode. For this purpose, ionic dopants are added to the basic substances of the polymer, forming a conductive surface layer on the dielectric during the first impregnation. During subsequent impregnation cycles, the in-situ polymerization can be time-controlled by the current flow after applying a voltage between the anode and cathode. With this method a fine and stable polypyrrole film on the dielectric oxide layer of the anode can be realized. [...] However, both methods of in situ polymerization are complex and require multiple repetition polymerization steps that increase manufacturing costs.|$|E

The overall achieved conversion efficiency of this device is around 10&minus;5 %. Nonetheless, optical rectenna research is ongoing.

50|$|A keel-shaped needle with a {{titanium}} <b>electrode</b> <b>layer</b> {{rides in}} the groove with extremely light tracking force (65 mg) and an electronic circuit is formed through the disc and stylus. Like an audio turntable, the stylus reads the disc, starting at the outer edge and going towards the center. The video and audio signals are stored on the Videodiscs in a composite analog signal which is encoded into vertical undulations {{in the bottom of}} the groove, somewhat like pits. These undulations have a shorter wavelength than the length of the stylus tip {{in the groove}}, and the stylus rides over them; the varying distance between the stylus tip and the conductive surface due to the depth of the undulations in the groove under the stylus directly controls the capacitance between the stylus and the conductive carbon-loaded PVC disc. This varying capacitance in turn alters the frequency of a resonant circuit, producing an FM electrical signal which is then decoded into video and audio signals by the player's electronics.|$|E

50|$|SageGlass is {{electronically}} tintable {{glass for}} use in buildings. It incorporates nanotechnology consisting of five layers of ceramic materials, which have a total thickness that is less than 1/50th that of a human hair. When voltage is applied than 5V DC it darkens as lithium ions and associated electrons transfer from the counter electrode to an electrochromic <b>electrode</b> <b>layer</b> (see Figure 1). Reversing the voltage polarity causes the ions and associated electrons {{to return to their}} original layer, the counter electrode, and the glass clears. This solid state electrochromic reaction is controlled through a low voltage DC power supply. When the SageGlass coating darkens, the sun’s light and heat are absorbed and subsequently reradiated from the glass surface to the exterior - much the way low-emissivity glass also keeps out unwanted heat.For example, on hot, sunny days the tint in the windows would darken to reduce glare and block out heat. On cold, cloudy days the windows would clear to allow sunlight and heat to fill the office or home. The electrical switching of tints can be operated manually or integrated into an automated building management system. SageGlass modulates visible light transmission and solar heat gain, and, in the tinted condition, blocks 91 percent of the solar heat gain.|$|E
50|$|There are {{two basic}} {{friction}} processes: normal contact, and lateral sliding. We demonstrated here a TENG that is designed based on the in-plane sliding between the two surfaces in lateral direction. With an intensive triboelectrification facilitated by sliding friction, a periodic change in the contact area between two surfaces leads to a lateral separation of the charge centers, which creates a voltage drop for driving the flow of electrons in the external load. The sliding-induced electricity generation mechanism is schematically depicted in the figure. In the original position, the two polymeric surfaces fully overlap and intimately contact with each other. Because of the large difference {{in the ability to}} attract electrons, the triboelectrification will leave one surface with net positive charges and the other with net negative charges with equal density. Since the tribo-charges on the insulators will only distribute in the surface layer and will not be leaked out {{for an extended period of}} time, the separation between the positively charged surface and negatively charged surface is negligible at this overlapping position, and thus there will be little electric potential drop across the two electrodes. Once the top plate with the positively charged surface starts to slide outward, the in-plane charge separation is initiated due to the decrease in contact surface area. The separated charges will generate an electric field pointing from the right to the left almost parallel to the plates, inducing a higher potential at the top electrode. This potential difference will drive a current flow from the top electrode to the bottom electrode in order to generate an electric potential drop that cancels the tribo-charge-induced potential. Because the vertical distance between the <b>electrode</b> <b>layer</b> and the tribo-charged polymeric surface is negligible compared to the lateral charge separation distance, the amount of the transferred charges on the electrodes approximately equals to the amount of the separated charges at any sliding displacement. Thus, the current flow will continue with the continuation of the ongoing sliding process that keeps increasing the separated charges, until the top plate fully slides out of the bottom plate and the tribo-charged surfaces are entirely separated. The measured current should be determined by the rate at which the two plates are being slid apart. Subsequently, when the top plate is reverted to slide backwards, the separated charges begins to get in contact again but no annihilation due to the insulator nature of the polymer materials. The redundant transferred charges on the electrodes will flow back through the external load with the increase of the contact area, in order to keep the electrostatic equilibrium. This will contribute to a current flow from the bottom electrode to the top electrode, along with the second half cycle of sliding. Once the two plates reach the overlapping position, the charged surfaces get into fully contact again. There will be no transferred charges left on the electrode, and the device returns to the first state. In this entire cycle, the processes of sliding outwards and inwards are symmetric, so a pair of symmetric alternating current peaks should be expected.|$|E
