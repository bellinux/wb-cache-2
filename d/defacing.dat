5|$|The older {{writing was}} first noticed by Pierre Allix, a Protestant pastor. Jean Boivin, {{supervisor}} of the Royal Library, made the first extracts of various readings of the codex (under the notation of Paris 9) to Ludolph Küster, who published Mill's New Testament in 1710. In 1834–1835 potassium ferricyanide was used to bring out faded or eradicated ink, which {{had the effect of}} <b>defacing</b> the vellum from green and blue to black and brown.|$|E

5|$|After {{a failed}} attempt to assassinate President Dale, the Martians invade Earth, {{starting}} with Washington, D.C. As they attack the White House (and incinerate the White House tour guide), the Secret Service evacuates the President, but the First Lady Marsha is crushed to death by the Nancy Reagan chandelier. Taffy vanishes during the chaos. After the U.S. government unsuccessfully attempts a nuclear attack on the mother ship, the Martians expand their invasion {{to the rest of}} Earth, <b>defacing</b> world landmarks for their own amusement as they do so. That night, the Martians breach the bunker where Dale has been taken and the leader reduces Decker to the size of an insect before killing him. The Martians kill everyone else in the bunker except for Dale, who makes an impassioned speech in an attempt to plea for peace and his life. The Martians seem convinced, but then use a false hand to kill the President.|$|E
5|$|Much of {{the prison}} {{business}} was run by a debtors' committee of nine prisoners and a chair (a position held by Dickens' father). Appointed on the last Wednesday of each month, and meeting every Monday at 11am, the committee was responsible for imposing fines for rules violations, an obligation they met with enthusiasm. Debtors could be fined for theft; throwing water or filth out of windows or into someone else's room; making noise after midnight; cursing, fighting or singing obscene songs; smoking in the beer room from 8–10 am and 12–2 pm; <b>defacing</b> the staircase; dirtying the privy seats; stealing newspapers or utensils from the snuggery; urinating in the yard; drawing water before it had boiled; and criticizing the committee.|$|E

25|$|In the 1630s a west {{front was}} added to the {{building}} by England's first classical architect, Inigo Jones. There was much <b>defacing</b> and mistreatment of the building by Parliamentarian forces during the Civil War, and the old documents and charters were dispersed and destroyed. During the Commonwealth, those churchyard buildings that were razed supplied ready-dressed building material for construction projects, such as the Lord Protector's city palace, Somerset House. Crowds were drawn to the north-east corner of the churchyard, St Paul's Cross, where open-air preaching took place.|$|E
25|$|The borough has {{sponsored}} graffiti artists to paint certain public {{areas such as}} on and under bridges. The goal is to divert said artists away from illegally <b>defacing</b> property and creating murals and encouraging more talented prospects to more formal training. These graffiti murals have had themes such as the war in Iraq and {{can be seen at}} intersections as Insurgentes/Renato Leduc and Calzada Tlalpan/Viaducto Tlalpan {{as well as on the}} highway leading to Cuernavaca. The borough has also encouraged the creation of formal graffiti “guilds” to work with authorities on projects.|$|E
25|$|In 2007, {{thousands}} of tonnes of foul-smelling refuse were {{piled up in}} Naples, Italy and its surrounding villages, <b>defacing</b> entire neighbourhoods.

25|$|A {{big problem}} for SKM are {{homeless}} people who in winter time seek shelter in the trains. SKM is trying to solve security problems in the trains, problems that are especially evident at night. Security is handled by SOK (Służba Ochrony Kolei, Rail Protection Office) officers and private security companies. Police and City Guard patrols are also more common than they once were. Another essential problem for SKM management are people <b>defacing</b> Electrical Multiple Units (EMUs) with graffiti. The company's spokesman, Wróblewski, assumes annually costs of removing paint from the trains as ce. 150 000 zł (about 50 000 USD).|$|E
25|$|In {{addition}} to a fine or jail term, the Act imposes mandatory corporal punishment of between three and eight strokes of the cane for second or subsequent convictions. Caning is also imposed for first convictions for <b>defacing</b> property using an indelible substance; and stealing, destroying or damaging public property. The Children and Young Persons Act ("CYPA") states that the High Court may impose a caning penalty on juvenile offenders as well. In a 1968 case, the High Court held that despite the wording of this provision, a subordinate court may sentence juveniles to caning under the Vandalism Act as that Act takes precedence over the CYPA.|$|E
25|$|An {{artist with}} a strong distaste for {{industrial}} waste, cars and rubbish, Wilson took to carving sculptures in wooded areas. He would later find many of his carvings vandalized and destroyed. He had already created collages that incorporated collected bits of litter and had painted over billboards and advertisements {{in an effort to}} beautify the urban environment, an effort that brought him trouble with the law. He came on the idea of painting chewing gum, which required no gallery, bureaucracy, or permit and was not <b>defacing</b> property, since the gum was already discarded. He began painting gum on Barnet High Street, intending to create a trail into the centre of London.|$|E
