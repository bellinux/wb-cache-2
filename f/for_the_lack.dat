The film consists of specially shot footage by Temple at the festival, as well as footage sent in by fans and archive footage. Glastonbury was released in the UK on 14 April 2006.|$|E
50|$|The Bahá'í Faith {{asserts that}} evil is {{non-existent}} {{and that it}} is a concept <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> of good, just as cold is the state of no heat, darkness is the state of no light, forgetfulness <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> of memory, ignorance <b>the</b> <b>lacking</b> of knowledge.

50|$|Presently, {{there is}} no therapy or {{treatment}} for phonagnosia.

Increased research will reveal vital information needed to formulate effective treatments and therapies.|$|R

5|$|Upon release, {{the game}} {{received}} a generally favorable reception, praised for its atmospheric and strategic gameplay and its graphics, audio work and overall presentation.

5|$|According to Schultheiss, Herrmann, and Jonas, {{although}} Trousseau {{had earlier}} suggested that surgery was a viable option, {{there is no}} evidence that the subject subsequently received treatment; They suggest several possible factors, including legal issues, the subject's refusal, or failed treatment followed by a lack of reporting, <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of surgery or evidence of such. Maisonneuve, partially shown in one of the photographs, treated another intersex patient in 1862.|$|E
50|$|The unusual {{octagonal}} {{structure is}} said to serve several functions. It is strong, relatively easy to thatch, and provides the occupants with a more panoramic view.

5|$|Following {{the death}} of his father in 1894, Riley began regretting his choice not to marry or have children. To {{compensate}} <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of his own children, he became a doting uncle, showering gifts on his nieces and nephews. He had repurchased his childhood home in 1893 and allowed his divorced sister, Mary, his widowed sister-in-law, Julia, and their daughters to live in the home. He provided for all their needs and spent the summer months of 1893 living with them. He took his nephew Edmund Eital as a personal secretary and gave him a $50,000 wedding gift in 1912. Riley was well loved by his family.|$|E
5|$|How {{were such}} effects produced, {{and how did}} they look? The {{crocodile}} etc. obviously used the floor trap, but was it an illusionistically painted figure worked with sticks, or a man in a crocodile suit? There are no extant drawings or descriptions of machinery and sets for the Restoration theatre, although some documentation exists for court masques from {{the first half of the}} 17th century, notably the work of Inigo Jones and his pupil John Webb. One reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of information for the public theatres is that stage effects, and particularly machines, were trade secrets. Inventors of theatrical effects took great pains to hold on to their secrets, and the playhouses guarded their machine workings as zealously as a magician guards her or his tricks.|$|E
5|$|However, it {{was more}} {{difficult}} in practice. The French were still a vacillating ally until the spring/summer, 1940, but the Command was still stretched by German naval forces operating from Germany, and then Norway. The Germans used surface vessels and U-boats to breakout into the Atlantic by using periods of dark, in winter, and weather conditions unfavourable to aircraft that were still without radar. Tiger Moth biplanes were used, as were civil pilots, to compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of Hudsons. These machines were also without armament to defend from enemy fighters. It could carry 250lb DCs, {{but there was no}} sufficient stock. Only 100lb bombs could be used by the Anson, and they were ineffective. Crew were also insufficiently trained.|$|E

5|$|In Maine, on {{the other}} side of the Atlantic, {{shifting}} fish populations due to changes in sea temperature are being blamed <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of availability of the herring which is the staple diet of the puffins in the area. Some adult birds have become emaciated and died. Others have been provisioning the nest with butterfish (Peprilus triacanthus) but these are often too large and deep-bodied for the chick to swallow, causing it to die from starvation. Maine is on the southerly edge of the bird's breeding range and with changing weather patterns, this may be set to contract northwards.|$|E
5|$|In early 1941 the British press, with {{permission}} from the Air Ministry, was allowed to approach Cunningham and write about his experiences. One of the motivating reasons <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of censorship was morale. In {{the early stages of}} the Blitz, the perception among the civilian population was that the Germans could attack at will over Britain during the night. The publication of Cunningham's exploits were an attempt to assure the public the RAF was fighting back and imposing losses upon the Luftwaffe. Cunningham was singled out for attention for this purpose, though Rawnsley's contribution to his success was virtually ignored.|$|E
5|$|One reason <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of sales, and for {{the poor}} {{condition}} of many surviving specimens, was that while the fair was open, the economic Panic of 1893 began, {{one of the worst}} depressions in the nation's history—fifty cents could make the difference between a family eating or starving {{at a time when the}} average visitor to the fair spent $1.18. Fairgoers were disinclined to exchange a dollar for a fifty-cent piece, and those who had bought Columbian half dollars before the crash often spent their souvenirs.|$|E

5|$|Prior to Pulos and Hutt's work, {{researchers}} were {{split on the}} mode of inheritance of white and whether it was deleterious (harmful). Recent research has discovered several possible genetic pathways to a white coat, so disparities in these historical findings may reflect the action of different genes. It {{is also possible that}} the varied origins of Pulos and Hutt's white horses might be responsible <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of homozygotes. Therefore, it remains to be proven whether all equine dominant white mutations cause embryonic lethality in the homozygous state.|$|E
5|$|Tactile ASL (TASL) is {{a variety}} of ASL used {{throughout}} the United States by and with the deaf-blind. It is particularly common among those with Usher's syndrome. This syndrome results in deafness from birth followed by loss of vision later in life; consequently, those with Usher's syndrome often {{grow up in the}} Deaf community using ASL, and later transition to TASL. TASL differs from ASL in that signs are produced by touching the palms, and there are some grammatical differences from standard ASL in order to compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of non-manual signing.|$|E
5|$|The 'defects' of one organ are {{remedied}} by {{the structure}} of another. The elephant has, Paley argues, a short neck because its head is so heavy, but in compensation it has a long trunk, enabling it to reach out.

5|$|The game {{received}} generally positive reviews, with {{praise for}} its visuals, traversal system, combat system, and humor. However, {{the game was}} criticized <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a compelling story or innovative quest design.

The game was supported with multiple downloadable content, including the story-based The Mystery of the Mooil Rig and Dawn of the Rise of the Fallen Machine, after the game's release.|$|E
5|$|The {{group and}} Botnick {{organized}} a makeshift recording studio at their private rehearsal space, the Doors' Workshop, in a two-story building at 8512 Santa Monica Boulevard. They could then record {{in a more}} comfortable and relaxed setting while avoiding the expenses of a professional studio. A mixing console previously owned by Elektra was installed upstairs in the Workshop, while studio monitors, microphones, and keyboards were set up downstairs. To compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of an isolated vocal booth, Morrison recorded in the bathroom doorway, singing into the same microphone used on the Doors' final tour.|$|E
5|$|The group's early {{sound was}} geared more towards {{psychedelic}} rock with only occasional classical influences. Following O'List's departure, Emerson's {{control over the}} band's direction became greater, resulting in more complex music. The absence of a guitar in the band and Emerson's redefining {{of the role of}} keyboard instruments in rock set the Nice apart from many of its contemporaries. He used a combination of Marshall Amplification and Leslie speakers in order to project a full sound to compensate <b>for</b> <b>the</b> <b>lack</b> of a guitarist.|$|E
