50|$|Hypoxemia (or <b>hypoxaemia</b> in British English) is an {{abnormally}} {{low level}} of oxygen in the blood. More specifically, it is oxygen deficiency in arterial blood. Hypoxemia has many causes, often respiratory disorders, and can cause tissue hypoxia as the blood is not supplying enough oxygen to the body.|$|E
50|$|It {{may also}} be {{indicated}} for any other patient where their injury or illness has caused <b>hypoxaemia,</b> although in this case oxygen flow should be moderated to achieve target oxygen saturation levels, based on pulse oximetry (with a target level of 94-98% in most patients, or 88-92% in COPD patients).|$|E
50|$|Hypoxemia {{refers to}} {{insufficient}} {{oxygen in the}} blood. Thus any cause that influences the rate or volume of air entering the lungs (ventilation) or any cause that influences the transfer of air from the lungs to the blood may cause hypoxemia. As well as these respiratory causes, cardiovascular causes such as shunts may also result in <b>hypoxaemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|Ascites is characterised by {{hypertrophy}} and dilatation of the heart, {{changes in}} liver function, pulmonary insufficiency, <b>hypoxaemia</b> and accumulation of {{large amounts of}} fluid in the abdominal cavity.

50|$|The {{outcome of}} brain {{ischemia}} {{is influenced by}} the quality of subsequent supportive care. Systemic blood pressure (or slightly above) should be maintained so that cerebral blood flow is restored. Also, <b>hypoxaemia</b> and hypercapnia should be avoided. Seizures can induce more damage; accordingly, anticonvulsants should be prescribed and should a seizure occur, aggressive treatment should be undertaken. Hyperglycaemia should also be avoided during brain ischemia.|$|E

5000|$|Chronic {{mountain}} sickness (CMS or Monge's disease) is {{a disease}} in which the proportion of blood volume that is occupied by red blood cells increases (polycythaemia) {{and there is an}} abnormally low level of oxygen in the blood (<b>hypoxaemia).</b> CMS typically develops after extended time living at high altitude (over [...] ) so is most common amongst native populations of high altitude nations. The most frequent symptoms of CMS are headache, dizziness, tinnitus, breathlessness, palpitations, sleep disturbance, fatigue, loss of appetite, confusion, cyanosis, and dilation of veins.|$|E
50|$|Reduced {{capillary}} {{transit time}} occurs {{due to an}} increased blood flow within the pulmonary capillary. Capillary transit time (tc), at rest is around 0.8s, allowing {{plenty of time for}} the diffusion of oxygen into the circulation and the diffusion of CO2 out of the circulation. After training, the capillary volume is still the same however cardiac output is increased, resulting in a decreased capillary transit time, reducing to around 0.16s in trained individuals at maximal work rates. This does not give sufficient time for gas diffusion and results in a <b>hypoxaemia.</b>|$|E
50|$|The {{effect is}} named for Bernard Raymond Fink (1914-2000), whose 1955 paper first {{explained}} it.When a patient is recovering from N2O anaesthesia, large quantities of this gas cross from the blood into the alveolus (down its concentration gradient) and so {{for a short period}} of time, the O2 and CO2 in the alveolus are diluted by this gas. This could cause the partial pressure of oxygen to decrease and could temporarily lead to hypoxia. The decrease in CO2 could also potentiate this effect as ventilation would be suppressed, leading to potential <b>hypoxaemia.</b> Nonetheless, this effect would only last a couple of minutes and hypoxia can be avoided by increasing the fractional inspired oxygen concentration when recovering from N2O anaesthesia.|$|E
5000|$|... 2,3-Bisphosphoglycerate or 2,3-BPG (formerly named 2,3-diphosphoglycerate or 2,3-DPG, {{which is}} now {{considered}} obsolete and incorrect) is an organophosphate formed in erythrocytes during glycolysis and is the conjugate base of 2,3-bisphosphoglyceric acid. The production of 2,3-BPG is likely an important adaptive mechanism, because the production increases for several conditions {{in the presence of}} diminished peripheral tissue O2 availability, such as <b>hypoxaemia,</b> chronic lung disease, anaemia, and congestive heart failure, among others. High levels of 2,3-BPG shift the curve to the right (as in childhood), while low levels of 2,3-BPG cause a leftward shift, seen in states such as septic shock, and hypophosphataemia. In the absence of 2,3-BPG, hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen increases. 2,3-BPG acts as a heteroallosteric effector of hemoglobin, lowering hemoglobin's affinity for oxygen by binding preferentially to deoxyhemoglobin. An increased concentration of BPG in red blood cells favours formation of the T, low-affinity state of hemoglobin and so the oxygen-binding curve will shift to the right.|$|E
50|$|In central sleep apnea, {{the basic}} {{neurological}} controls for breathing rate malfunction {{and fail to}} give the signal to inhale, causing the individual to miss one or more cycles of breathing. If the pause in breathing is long enough, the percentage of oxygen in the circulation will drop to a lower than normal level (<b>hypoxaemia)</b> and the concentration of carbon dioxide will build to a higher than normal level (hypercapnia). In turn, these conditions of hypoxia and hypercapnia will trigger additional effects on the body. Brain cells need constant oxygen to live, and if the level of blood oxygen goes low enough for long enough, the consequences of brain damage and even death will occur. However, central sleep apnea is more often a chronic condition that causes much milder effects than sudden death. The exact effects of the condition {{will depend on how}} severe the apnea is and on the individual characteristics of the person having the apnea.

40|$|AbstractIn {{order to}} clarify whether nocturnal <b>hypoxaemia</b> (arterial oxygen saturation, SaO 2 < 90 % may {{exist in the}} {{long-term}} before daytime <b>hypoxaemia</b> (PaO 2 < 8 · 0 kPa) occurs in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD), 21 patients with stable severe COPD without daytime <b>hypoxaemia</b> (PaO 2 ≥ 8 · 0 kPa) were studied prospectively. Subjects were monitored twice by polysomnography (PSG) 12 months apart. Spirometry was performed, and diffusion capacity (DlCO) and hypercapnic respiratory drive response ΔPi 0 · 1 ΔPCO 2 − 1) were measured during the daytime in conjunetion with polysomnography. At the start of the study our subjects had FEV 1 %P (FEV 1 as a percentage of predicted value) of 26 · 1 ± 7 · 2 %, a mean nocturnal nadir SaO 2 of 83 ± 5 %, and a mean SaO 2 during nocturnal hypoxaemic episodes of 88 · 0 ± 0 · 7 %. The patients' ΔPi 0 · 1 ΔPCO 2 − 1 was 1 · 8 ± 1 · 4 cm H 2 O kPa− 1 (within the normal range). For the entire study group, no significant change in any lung function or blood gas parameter was noted during the year of observation, and nocturnal SaO 2 remained unaltered. Stage I sleep decreased (P< 0 · 05) after 12 months. Prolonged stage I sleep was associated with nocturnal <b>hypoxaemia</b> at the second PSG. Five subjects developed daytime <b>hypoxaemia</b> and they showed poorer lung function but similar nocturnal <b>hypoxaemia</b> and ΔPi 0 · 1 ΔPCO 2 − 1 level compared {{to the rest of the}} patients. Patients with sudden SaO 2 dips had more pronounced nocturnal <b>hypoxaemia</b> and prolonged wakefulness than ‘non-dippers’. In conclusion, the mean level of nocturnal <b>hypoxaemia</b> may persist unaltered for at least 1 yr. COPD patients with exclusively nocturnal <b>hypoxaemia</b> have a hypercapnic drive response within the normal range.

Results. In 87 study nights there were 2403 (individual range 1 – 229) episodes of <b>hypoxaemia,</b> 3509 (individual range 1 – 234) episodes of tachycardia, and 265 (individual range 1 – 73) episodes of ST segment deviation.

40|$|We {{tested the}} {{hypothesis}} that enhanced nitric oxide (NO) opposes fetal peripheral vasoconstrictor responses to acute <b>hypoxaemia</b> via actions involving the carotid chemoreflex and the adrenal medulla. The hypothesis was tested in the late gestation ovine fetus using a novel NO clamp technique, which involves fetal combined treatment with the NO synthase inhibitor, l-NAME, and the NO donor, sodium nitroprusside. In contrast to treatment with l-NAME alone, combined fetal treatment with l-NAME and nitroprusside prevents generalized vasoconstriction and pronounced hypertension, not only maintaining basal cardiovascular function, but also permitting blockade of the de novo synthesis of NO during <b>hypoxaemia</b> while compensating for the tonic production of the gas. Under general anaesthesia, seven sheep fetuses were surgically prepared with catheters and a femoral Transonic flow probe. Five days after surgery, fetuses were subjected to a 3 h protocol: 1 h normoxia, 1 h <b>hypoxaemia</b> and 1 h recovery. Fetal <b>hypoxaemia</b> was induced during either fetal infusion with saline or treatment with the NO clamp. During saline infusion, fetuses responded to <b>hypoxaemia</b> with transient bradycardia, femoral vasoconstriction and increases in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline.

In {{order to}} determine the frequency of <b>hypoxaemia</b> and to evaluate the role of increased closing capacity in producing <b>hypoxaemia</b> in patients with cirrhosis of the liver, 13 patients with well-established cirrhosis were studied. 'Arterial blood gases, spirometry, lung volume, and closing capacity measure-ments were made with the patients in the seated and recumbent positions after exclusion of cardiopulmonary dysfunction. Four of 13 and six of 12 patients exhibited significant <b>hypoxaemia</b> in the seated and recumbent positions respectively. Five of 13 patients showed a closing capacity greater than predicted. This frequency of increased closing capacity was not higher than in a group of smokers of the same age. Unlike Ruff et al.

The association between <b>hypoxaemia</b> and cirrhosis of the liver has been known since the report of Snell in 1935.

Most deaths from asthma occur outside hospital, where <b>hypoxaemia</b> {{is likely to be}} a complicating factor. The cardiovascular effects of fenoterol have been investigated therefore under conditions of normoxaemia and <b>hypoxaemia.</b> METHOD: Eight healthy men were studied on two occasions. Measurements of heart rate, blood pressure, total electromechanical systole (QS 2 I), electrocardiographic QTc interval, cardiac index, stroke volume, and ejection fraction were made under conditions of normoxaemia and <b>hypoxaemia</b> (arterial oxygen saturation 90 %) before and after administration of 800 micrograms of fenoterol by a metered dose inhaler. The order in which treatments were applied was according to a Latin square design. RESULTS: Before inhalation of fenoterol <b>hypoxaemia</b> was associated with a significant increase in heart rate (8 beats/min) and QTc interval (15. 6 ms). Under conditions of normoxaemia fenoterol caused a significant increase in heart rate (14. 3 beats/min), systolic blood pressure (7. 7 mm Hg), stroke volume (27. 7 ml), cardiac index (1. 6 1 /min/m 2), ejection fraction (11. 48), and QTc interval (32. 9 ms) and a fall in QS 2 I (- 23. 2 ms) and diastolic blood pressure (- 8. 4 mm Hg).

40|$|OBJECTIVE: To {{describe}} {{the prevalence of}} <b>hypoxaemia</b> in children admitted {{to a hospital in}} Kenya for the purpose of identifying clinical signs of <b>hypoxaemia</b> for emergency triage assessment, and to test the hypothesis that such signs lead to correct identification of <b>hypoxaemia</b> in children, irrespective of their diagnosis. METHODS: From 2002 to 2005 we prospectively collected clinical data and pulse oximetry measurements for all paediatric admissions to Kilifi District Hospital, Kenya, irrespective of diagnosis, and assessed the prevalence of <b>hypoxaemia</b> in relation to the WHO clinical syndromes of 'pneumonia' on admission and the final diagnoses made at discharge. We used the data collected over the first three years to derive signs predictive of <b>hypoxaemia,</b> and data from the fourth year to validate those signs. FINDINGS: Hypoxemia was found in 977 of 15 289 (6. 4 %) of all admissions (5 % to 19 % depending on age group) and was strongly associated with inpatient mortality (age-adjusted risk ratio: 4. 5; 95 % confidence interval, CI: 3. 8 - 5. 3). Although most hypoxaemic children aged > 60 days met the WHO criteria for a syndrome of 'pneumonia' on admission, only 215 of the 693 (31 %) such children had a final diagnosis of lower respiratory tract infection (LRTI). The most predictive signs for <b>hypoxaemia</b> included shock, a heart rate 60 breaths per minute and impaired consciousness. However, 5 - 15 % of the children who had <b>hypoxaemia</b> on admission were missed, and 18 % of the children were incorrectly identified as hypoxaemic. CONCLUSION: The syndromes of pneumonia make it possible to identify most hypoxaemic children, including those without LRTI. Shock, bradycardia and irregular breathing are important predictive signs, and severe malaria with respiratory distress is a common cause of <b>hypoxaemia.</b> Overall, however, clinical signs are poor predictors of <b>hypoxaemia,</b> and using pulse oximetry in resource-poor health facilities to target oxygen therapy is likely to save costs...|$|E
40|$|Aims: Activity in the {{renin-angiotensin system}} (RAS) may {{influence}} the susceptibility to cardiac arrhythmia. To study the effect of basal RAS activity on cardiac repolarization during myocardial stress induced by hypoglycaemia or <b>hypoxaemia</b> in healthy humans. Methods and results: Ten subjects with high RAS activity and 10 subjects with low RAS activity were studied on three different occasions: (i) hypoglycaemia (nadir P-glucose 2. 7 ± 0. 5 mmol/L), (ii) <b>hypoxaemia</b> (nadir pO 25. 8 ± 0. 5 kPa), and (iii) normoglycaemic normoxia (control day). QT parameters were registered by Holter monitoring. Hypoglycaemia and <b>hypoxaemia</b> induced QTc prolongation (P < 0. 001, both stimuli). The QT/RR slope and the VR increased {{as a function of}} hypoglycaemia, but were unaffected by <b>hypoxaemia.</b> Low RAS activity was associated with a steeper QT/RR slope in the recovery phase after both stimuli: hypoglycaemia: P = 0. 04; hypoxia: P = 0. 03. RAS activity had no impact on QTc [P = 0. 48 (hypoglycaemia) and P = 0. 40 (<b>hypoxaemia)</b> ] {{or any of the other}} outcome variables. Conclusion: Basal RAS activity has significant impact on QT dynamics, but not the corrected QT interval, during recovery from hypoglycaemia and <b>hypoxaemia.</b> The impact, however, is modest and more subtle than initially expected. The clinical relevance is unclear...|$|E

40|$|Aim There are 2. 7 million {{neonatal}} deaths annually, 75 % of which occur in sub-Saharan Africa and South Asia. Effective treatment of <b>hypoxaemia</b> through tailored oxygen therapy could reduce neonatal mortality and prevent oxygen toxicity. Methods We undertook a two-part prospective study of neonates {{admitted to a}} neonatal unit in Nairobi, Kenya, between January and December 2015. We determined the prevalence of <b>hypoxaemia</b> and explored associations of clinical risk factors and signs of respiratory distress with <b>hypoxaemia</b> and mortality. After staff training on oxygen saturation (SpO 2) target ranges, we enrolled a consecutive sample of neonates admitted for oxygen and measured SpO 2 at 0, 6, 12, 18 and 24 h post-admission. We estimated the proportion of neonates outside the target range (≥ 34 weeks: ≥ 92 %; Results A total of 477 neonates were enrolled. Prevalence of <b>hypoxaemia</b> was 29. 2 %. Retractions (odds ratio (OR) 2. 83, 95 % CI 1. 47 – 5. 47), nasal flaring (OR 2. 68, 95 % CI 1. 51 – 4. 75), and grunting (OR 2. 47, 95 % CI 1. 27 – 4. 80) {{were significantly associated with}} <b>hypoxaemia.</b> Nasal flaring (OR 2. 85, 95 % CI 1. 25 – 6. 54), and <b>hypoxaemia</b> (OR 3. 06, 95 % CI 1. 54 – 6. 07) were significantly associated with mortality; 64 % of neonates receiving oxygen were out of range at ≥ 2 time points and 43 % at ≥ 3 time points. Conclusion There is a high prevalence of <b>hypoxaemia</b> at admission and a strong association between <b>hypoxaemia</b> and mortality in this Kenyan neonatal unit. Many neonates had out of range SpO 2 values while receiving oxygen. Further research is needed to test strategies aimed at improving the accuracy of oxygen provision in low-resource settings. </p...|$|E
40|$|In the {{mammalian}} fetus, {{the cardiovascular}} responses to acute <b>hypoxaemia</b> include a redistribution of the cardiac output {{away from the}} periphery towards the adrenal, myocardial and cerebral circulations. A component of the peripheral vasoconstriction is mediated by increased release of catecholamines into the fetal circulation during acute <b>hypoxaemia.</b> Previously, we {{have shown that the}} chick embryo also shows an increase in peripheral vascular resistance during acute <b>hypoxaemia</b> and that this response becomes progressively larger {{towards the end of the}} incubation period. However, the ontogeny of the catecholaminergic response to acute <b>hypoxaemia</b> has not been investigated in this species. Fertilised chicken eggs were studied on days 10, 13, 16 and 19 of incubation (hatching is at 21 days). At each stage of incubation, blood samples were obtained from the chorioallantoic artery of the chick embryos during normoxia and after 5 min of <b>hypoxaemia</b> for measurement of plasma concentrations of adrenaline and noradrenaline by HPLC. Basal plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline concentrations by the end of the incubation period were much higher in the chick embryo than values reported for mammalian fetuses during late gestation. During normoxia, basal plasma noradrenaline concentration remained unchanged during development but plasma adrenaline concentration showed a developmental increase from < 25. 1 pmol l− 1 at day 10 to 3 nmol l− 1 at day 19 of incubation. Acute <b>hypoxaemia</b> caused an increase in plasma noradrenaline and adrenaline from day 13 and day 16 of incubation, respectively. In addition, the increase in plasma adrenaline and noradrenaline and in the ratio of plasma adrenaline to noradrenaline during acute <b>hypoxaemia</b> became progressively larger by the end of the incubation period. These data show an ontogenic increase in basal plasma catecholamines and in the catecholaminergic response to acute <b>hypoxaemia</b> in the chick embryo during the last third of the incubation period...|$|E
