5|$|The {{massacre}} and Gandhi's non-violent {{response to}} it moved many, but also made some Sikhs and Hindus upset that Dyer was <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> murder. Investigation committees were formed by the British, which Gandhi asked Indians to boycott. The unfolding events, the massacre and the British response, led Gandhi {{to the belief that}} Indians will never get a fair equal treatment under British rulers, and he shifted his attention to Swaraj or self rule and political independence for India. In 1921, Gandhi was the leader of the Indian National Congress. He reorganised the Congress. With Congress now behind him, and Muslim support triggered by his backing the Khilafat movement to restore the Caliph in Turkey, Gandhi had the political support and the attention of the British Raj.|$|E

25|$|In the mid-to-late 2000s, many nu metal bands {{experimented with}} other genres and sounds. Linkin Park's third studio album Minutes to Midnight, {{released}} in 2007, was {{noted for its}} complete departure from the band's nu metal sound. Nu metal bands such as Disturbed and Drowning Pool moved to a hard rock or standard heavy metal sound. Slipknot also departed from their nu metal sound and included elements of groove metal, death metal and thrash metal into their music. Staind and Papa Roach moved to lighter sounds. Staind's 2003 album 14 Shades Of Grey does not express as much anger as the band's previous albums and shows the band's departure from heavy metal elements and a movement towards a lighter sound. Papa Roach abandoned the nu metal genre with their 2004 album <b>Getting</b> <b>Away</b> <b>with</b> Murder, moving to a hard rock style.|$|E

500|$|In July 1954, when Sam Sheppard, a Bay Village doctor, {{was accused}} of murdering his wife, the Cleveland Press {{published}} a series of front-page editorials, some written by Seltzer himself, alleging Sheppard's guilt and pushing for swift, punitive action from the local authorities. The stream of editorials began with the July 20 article [...] "Somebody Is <b>Getting</b> <b>Away</b> <b>With</b> Murder", written by Seltzer himself. The following day, the Press published another front-page editorial, addressed directly to County Coroner Sam Gerber: [...] "Why No Inquest? Do It Now, Dr. Gerber". A few hours after the editorial was published, Gerber ordered an inquest. And on July 30, the Press published an editorial entitled [...] "Quit Stalling – Bring Him In".

[...] He feels like he's losing his little girl but needs to keep Whitney under his control and not speak out."

500|$|Beginning in August, several {{professional}} athletes {{have participated in}} the 2016 U.S. national anthem protests. The protests began in the National Football League (NFL) after Colin Kaepernick of the San Francisco 49ers sat during the anthem, as opposed to the tradition of standing, before his team's third preseason game of 2016. During a post-game interview he explained his position stating, [...] "I am not going to stand up to show pride in a flag for a country that oppresses black people and people of color.

500|$|Hoosiers were {{fascinated with}} crime and criminals. Some historians {{have argued that}} the {{popularity}} of bandits and their exploits in robbing banks and <b>getting</b> <b>away</b> <b>with</b> murder derived from working class resentment against the excesses of the Gilded Age. A group of brothers from Seymour, who had served in the Civil War, formed the Reno Gang, the first outlaw gang in the United States. The Reno Gang, named for the brothers, terrorized Indiana and the region for several years. They were responsible for the first train robbery in the United States which occurred near Seymour in 1866. Their actions inspired a host of other outlaw gangs who copied their work, beginning several decades of high-profile train robberies. Pursued by detectives from the Pinkerton Detective Agency, most of the gang was captured in 1868 and lynched by vigilantes. Other notorious Hoosiers also flourished in the post-war years, including Belle Gunness, an infamous [...] "black widow" [...] serial killer. She killed more than twenty people, most of them men, between 1881 and her own murder in 1908.|$|E
500|$|In another {{review of}} the first book, Publishers Weekly noted that Smith [...] "create a fantasy world fit for the most discriminating medieval partisan.

[...] In a similar vein, Kirkus Reviews praised the first novel as [...] "Smith's lush descriptions evoke a fantastic yet credible world, where magic spells and enchanted stones are everyday facts of life." [...] M. Jean Greenlaw, contributing to The ALAN Review, lauded Smith for her [...] "language and imagery" [...] as well as [...] "her deft plotting [...] keep the reader glued to the pages." [...] Writing for the School Library Journal, Patricia Lothrop-Green, however, gave a largely negative review to the first part, highlighting [...] "huge logical leaps," [...] an [...] "utterly predictable plot," [...] and a heroine whom [...] "many readers will be thoroughly tired of" [...] {{by the end of}} the story.|$|E
