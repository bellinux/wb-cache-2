5|$|The {{political}} {{freedom of the}} American republic exerted a similar pull. Swedish peasants {{were some of the}} most literate in Europe, and consequently <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> European egalitarian and radical ideas that culminated in the Revolutions of 1848. The clash between Swedish liberalism and a repressive monarchist regime raised political awareness among the disadvantaged, many of whom looked to the U.S. to realize their republican ideals.|$|E
5|$|Alvarez <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nuclear chemists at the Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory and {{was able}} to work with Frank Asaro and Helen Michel, who used the {{technique}} of neutron activation analysis. In 1980, Alvarez, Alvarez, Asaro, and Michel published a seminal paper proposing an extraterrestrial cause for the Cretaceous-Paleogene extinction (then called the Cretaceous-Tertiary extinction). In the years following the publication of their article, the clay was also found to contain soot, glassy spherules, shocked quartz crystals, microscopic diamonds, and rare minerals formed only under conditions of great temperature and pressure.|$|E

5|$|As senior officer, Lamason <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> main {{camp and}} quickly built a {{rapport with the}} group. As a result, {{he was able to}} secure extra blankets, clothes, clogs and food for the airmen. Lamason also built a rapport with two other prisoners; French {{scientist}} Alfred Balachowsky and Dutch Olympian trainer Jan Robert. Both men had developed trustworthy contacts within the camp administrative area and were able to provide Lamason with reliable intelligence that assisted in the survival of the airmen.|$|E
5|$|Edward VIII succeeded {{his father}} on 20 January 1936, after which Simpson {{attended}} more official functions as the King's guest. Despite her name appearing regularly in the Court Circular, {{the name of her}} husband was conspicuously absent. In the summer of that year, the King eschewed the traditional prolonged stay at Balmoral in favour of a holiday with Simpson in the eastern Mediterranean that was widely covered in the American and continental European press, but not by the British press, which maintained a self-imposed silence. Nevertheless, Canadians and expatriate Britons, who <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> foreign reports, were largely scandalised by the coverage.|$|E
5|$|However, the {{interior}} design of Norfolk House was {{to define the}} London town house for the next century. The floor plan {{was based on an}} adaptation of one of the secondary wings he had built at Holkham Hall. A circuit of reception rooms centred on a grand staircase, with the staircase hall replacing the Italian traditional inner courtyard or two-storey hall. This arrangement of salons allowed guests at large parties to circulate, having been received {{at the head of the}} staircase, without doubling back on arriving guests. The second advantage was that while each room <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> next, it also <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> central stairs, thus allowing only one or two rooms to be used at a time for smaller functions. Previously, guests in London houses had had to reach the principal salon through a long enfilade of minor reception rooms. In this square and compact way, Brettingham came close to recreating the layout of an original Palladian Villa. He transformed what Andrea Palladio had conceived as a country retreat into a London mansion appropriate for the lifestyle of the British aristocracy, with its reversal of the usual Italian domestic pattern of a large palazzo in town, and a smaller villa in the country. As happened so often in Brettingham's career, Robert Adam later developed this design concept further, and was credited with its success. However, Brettingham's plan for Norfolk House was to serve as the prototype for many London mansions over the next few decades.|$|E

5|$|The {{break with}} Rome was not, by itself, a Reformation. That {{was to come}} from the {{dissemination}} of ideas. The views of the German reformer Martin Luther and his school were widely known and disputed in England. A major manifestation of theological radicalism in England was Lollardy, a movement deriving from the writings of John Wycliffe, the 14th century Bible translator, which stressed the primacy of Scripture. But after the execution of Sir John Oldcastle, leader of the Lollard rebellion of 1415, they never again <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> levers of power, and by the 15th century were much reduced in numbers and influence.|$|E

5|$|To block Bruges, Keyes and Lynes {{decided to}} conduct two raids on the ports through which Bruges <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> sea. Zeebrugge {{was to be}} {{attacked}} by a large force consisting of three blockships and numerous supporting warships. Ostend was faced by a similar but smaller force under immediate command of Lynes. The plan was for two obsolete cruisers— and —to be expended in blocking the canal which emptied at Ostend. These ships would be stripped to essential fittings and their lower holds and ballast filled with rubble and concrete. This would make them ideal barriers to access if sunk in the correct channel at the correct angle.|$|E

He used Walter the Chancellor and other now-lost works for the history of the Principality of Antioch. From the end of Fulcher's chronicle in 1127, William is the only source of information from an author living in Jerusalem. For events that happened in William's own lifetime, he interviewed older people who had witnessed the events about which he was writing, and drew on his own memory.|$|E
5|$|After the Great War, Moore {{received}} an ex-serviceman's grant {{to continue his}} education and in 1919 he became {{a student at the}} Leeds School of Art (now Leeds College of Art), which set up a sculpture studio especially for him. At the college, he met Barbara Hepworth, a fellow student who would also become a well-known British sculptor, and began a friendship and gentle professional rivalry that lasted for many years. In Leeds, Moore also <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> modernist works in the collection of Sir Michael Sadler, the University Vice-Chancellor, which had a pronounced effect on his development. In 1921, Moore won a scholarship to study at the Royal College of Art in London, along with Hepworth and other Yorkshire contemporaries. While in London, Moore extended his knowledge of primitive art and sculpture, studying the ethnographic collections at the Victoria and Albert Museum and the British Museum.|$|E

5|$|As {{the game}} neared completion, Miller began {{to market the}} game to players. Strongly {{encouraged}} by the updates the team was sending him, he began heavily advertising the game {{in all of the}} bulletin board systems (BBS) and game magazines he <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to.</b> <b>The</b> game was completed in early December 1990, and on the afternoon of December 14 Miller began uploading the completed first episode to BBSs, with the other two episodes listed as available for purchase as a mailed plastic bag with floppy disks for US$30. After the arrival of the first royalty check from Apogee, the team planned to quit Softdisk and start their own company. When their boss and owner of Softdisk Al Vekovius confronted them on their plans, as well as their use of company resources to develop the game, the team made no secret of their intentions. Vekovius initially proposed a joint venture between the team and Softdisk, which fell apart when the other employees of the firm threatened to quit in response, and after a few weeks of negotiation the team agreed to produce a series of games for Gamer's Edge, one every two months.|$|E
5|$|At 11:00 the {{security}} situation at the Air America compound was deteriorating as General Carey {{did not wish to}} risk his Marines by extending his perimeter to cover the Air America compound (LZ 40), so all Air America helicopters from this time operated out of the tennis courts in the DAO Annex (LZ 35). This move created fuel problems for Air America as they no longer <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> fuel supplies in their compound and at least initially they were refused fuel by the ships of TF76. According to US Naval Archives, at 12:30 an Air America Bell 205 landed Air Vice Marshal Nguyễn Cao Kỳ, Madame Kỳ, Dorothy Martin (wife of Ambassador Martin) and others on the USS Denver; contemporary reports state and photos show that Marshal Kỳ piloted his own UH-1H Huey to the USS Midway.|$|E
5|$|Following the Walpole sale many artists, {{including}} James Barry and John Flaxman, {{had made}} renewed {{calls for the}} establishment of a National Gallery, arguing that a British school of painting could only flourish if it <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> canon of European painting. The British Institution, founded in 1805 by a group of aristocratic connoisseurs, attempted to address this situation. The members lent works to exhibitions that changed annually, while an art school was held in the summer months. However, as the paintings that were lent were often mediocre, some artists resented the Institution and saw it as a racket for the gentry to increase the sale prices of their Old Master paintings. One of the Institution's founding members, Sir George Beaumont, Bt, would eventually play a major role in the National Gallery's foundation by offering a gift of 16 paintings.|$|E

5|$|Six {{visual effects}} {{companies}} worked in The Rise of Cobra, {{the most prominent}} being Digital Domain, which handled the Paris action sequences and the opening convoy sequence. For the Eiffel Tower destruction, special software was written for depicting how the crumbling metal works. To create the digital Eiffel Tower, the technicians <b>had</b> <b>access</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> original building plans, and built a digital model so complex {{that it could not}} fit in a single computer file. For the nanomites, designers used two proprietary software applications for their depiction—one made by Digital Domain, and another by Prime Focus VFX, which also created tools to generate 3D cloud and sky environments for the aerial scenes. Many scenarios were almost fully developed by computer-generated imagery, such as the landing platform of the Pit, the Cobra ice caverns, and the final underwater battle. As for the sound effects themselves, only one is considered popular and isn't instantly recognizable. When the pulse cannon fires upon the main submarine during the polar assault, the sound of a program de-resolution from the 1982 cult movie classic TRON can be heard.|$|E
