5|$|A greater misfortune {{occurred}} {{at the onset of}} the southern winter when the Aurora, locked in an ice-floe which broke off from the main shelf, was torn from its moorings. The ocean currents then pulled ship <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the sledding parties marooned on shore and drifted for over six months before breaking free of the ice. Sadly the Aurora's damaged rudder forced her to return to New Zealand rather than returning for the stranded shore party.|$|E

5|$|Although {{the closest}} scattered-disc objects {{approach}} the Sun at about 30–35AU, their orbits can extend well beyond 100AU.

The innermost portion of the scattered disc overlaps with a torus-shaped region of orbiting objects traditionally called the Kuiper belt, but its outer limits reach much <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the Sun and further {{above and below the}} ecliptic than the Kuiper belt proper.|$|E
5|$|Linguistically, BASL {{differs from}} other {{varieties}} of ASL in its phonology, syntax, and vocabulary. BASL tends {{to have a}} larger signing space, meaning that some signs are produced <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the body than in other dialects. Signers of BASL also tend to prefer two-handed variants of signs, while signers of ASL tend to prefer one-handed variants. Some signs are different in BASL as well, with some borrowings from African American English.|$|E
5|$|The {{ceremonial}} {{centre of}} the Maya city was where the ruling elite lived, and where the administrative functions of the city were performed, together with religious ceremonies. It was also where {{the inhabitants of the}} city gathered for public activities. Elite residential complexes occupied the best land around the city centre, while commoners had their residences dispersed <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the ceremonial centre. Residential units were built on top of stone platforms to raise them above the level of the rain season floodwaters.|$|E

5|$|To ease logistics, Norway {{took the}} {{initiative}} to establish Dronning Maud Land Air Network (DROMLAN), a cooperation between the countries with bases in Queen Maud Land to streamline transport costs.

The first flight that was a preliminary to DROMLAN was made in 2000 from Cape Town, South Africa, to Henriksenskjera, where a Twin Otter was used onwards to Troll.|$|E
5|$|Tropical Storm Emilia {{was a rare}} {{tropical}} cyclone that affected the Baja California peninsula in July 2006. The sixth tropical depression and fifth tropical storm of the 2006 Pacific hurricane season, it developed on July 21 about 400miles (650km) {{off the coast of}} Mexico. It moved northward toward the coast, reaching peak winds of 65mph (105km/h) before turning westward and encountering unfavorable conditions. Emilia later turned to the north, passing near Baja California as a strong tropical storm. Subsequently the storm moved <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the coast, and on July 27 it dissipated.|$|E

5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet (Psittacula eupatria) {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species' southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> its range. Subfossil remains of Newton's parakeet show that it differed from other Mascarene Psittacula species in some osteological features, but also had similarities, such as a reduced sternum, which suggests a close relationship. Skeletal features indicate an especially {{close relationship with the}} Alexandrine parakeet and the rose-ringed parakeet (Psittacula krameri), but the many derived features of Newton's parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues.|$|E
5|$|Based on {{morphological}} features, the Alexandrine parakeet {{has been}} proposed as the founder population for all Psittacula species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species's southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> its range. Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and Hume has proposed that this {{may also be the}} case for all the parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands.|$|E
5|$|Because of its asymmetry, the {{reaction}} between 249Cf and 50Ti was predicted {{to be the}} most favorable practical reaction for synthesizing unbinilium, although it is also somewhat cold, and is <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the neutron shell closure at N = 184 {{than any of the other}} three reactions attempted. No unbinilium atoms were identified, implying a limiting cross-section of 200fb. Jens Volker Kratz predicted the actual maximum cross-section for producing unbinilium by any of these reactions to be around 0.1fb; in comparison, the world record for the smallest cross section of a successful reaction was 30fb for {{the reaction}} 209Bi(70Zn,n)278Nh, and Kratz predicted a maximum cross-section of 20fb for producing the neighbouring ununennium. If these predictions are accurate, then synthesizing ununennium would be at the limits of current technology, and synthesizing unbinilium would require new methods.|$|E

40|$|Previous {{evidence}} {{has shown that}} the number of L and M cones in retina varies significantly between subjects. However, {{it is not clear how}} the variation of L/M ratio changes the behavioral performance of the subject. A model of transformation of data from retina to visual cortex for evaluation of various L/M cones ratios is presented. While L/M cone ratios close to 1 brings the best performance for one of postreceptoral (magnocellular) channels, we showed that the performance in the second channel (parvocells) will improve when the ratio <b>furthers</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> 1. Effects of different ratios of S were also explored...|$|R
5|$|Certain {{patterns}} of reflectivity are important clues for the meteorologist as well. The three body scatter spike is an example. This {{is the result}} of energy from the radar hitting hail and being deflected to the ground, where they deflect back to the hail and then to the radar. The energy took more time to go from the hail to the ground and back, as opposed to the energy that went direct from the hail to the radar, and the echo is <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the radar than the actual location of the hail on the same radial path, forming a cone of weaker reflectivities.|$|E

The 1986 VL represented a substantial makeover of the VK and {{would be the last}} of the mid-size Commodores. Designers distanced the Commodore <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> its Opel origins, by smoothing the lines of the outer body and incorporating a subtle tail spoiler. A thorough redesign of the nose saw the Commodore gain sleek, narrow headlamps and a shallower grille, while the Calais specification employed unique partially concealed headlamps.|$|E
5|$|On 9 February Mendizabal withdrew {{most of his}} {{men from}} Badajoz, leaving behind a 7,000-strong garrison. The field army's 9,000 {{infantry}} settled on the heights of San Cristóbal while the 3,000 horse encamped behind them on the plains of the Caya. The Spanish commander again ignored Wellington's plan, failing to dig entrenchments on the heights, nor did he send out a cavalry screen to protect his front and monitor the French movements. Soult, however, largely ignored the Spanish army {{for the next few}} days, concentrating instead on building up his siege lines and battering Badajoz. Heavy rains also flooded both the Guadiana and Gebora rivers, rendering them impassable, so that between 11–18 February the French were only able to shell {{the southern end of the}} Spanish line, pushing the Spaniards <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> Badajoz and the protection of the San Cristóbal fort.|$|E

5|$|Storm {{spotters}} {{are needed}} because radar {{systems such as}} NEXRAD do not detect a tornado; merely signatures which hint at the presence of tornadoes. Radar may give a warning before there is any visual evidence of a tornado or imminent tornado, but ground truth from an observer can either verify the threat or determine that a tornado is not imminent. The spotter's ability to see what radar cannot is especially important as distance from the radar site increases, because the radar beam becomes progressively higher in altitude <b>further</b> <b>away</b> <b>from</b> the radar, chiefly due to curvature of Earth, and the beam also spreads out.|$|E
