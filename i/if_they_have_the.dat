5|$|Tetra Master is a card-based minigame {{that can}} be {{initiated}} with various non-playable characters in the field. Players assemble a deck of five cards, which can be obtained via chests, given as a reward, or earned from fighting monsters. Each card has various arrows which point to the four sides and {{four corners of the}} card, and various stats that vary between cards, with rarer cards being more powerful. Players take it in turns to strategically place cards on a 4x4 playing grid based on the available directions. Battles can occur when players place a card next to another card, depending on where the player places it. If the defending card has no arrows whilst the attacking card has an arrow pointing towards it, that card is placed under the player's control. When two arrows meet with each other, the cards do battle based on their point values, with the losing card coming under the winning player's control, sometimes triggering combos that put multiple cards in the winner's control. After all cards are played, the winner is the player who has the most cards under their control, with a draw occurring <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same number of cards. The winning player may choose a card from their opponent's deck out of the ones they put under their control. If the winning player scores a perfect win however, in which all ten cards are put under their control, they will win all five cards from the opponent's deck.|$|E

25|$|Two linear systems {{using the}} same set of {{variables}} are equivalent if each of the equations in the second system can be derived algebraically from the equations in the first system, and vice versa.

It follows that two linear systems are equivalent if and only <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same solution set.|$|E
25|$|This {{term was}} {{introduced}} by Kelvin in 1904, the year that he published his Baltimore Lecture of 1884.

Recently, however, homochiral {{has been used in}} the same sense as enantiomerically pure. This is permitted in some journals (but not encouraged), its meaning changing into the preference of a process or system for a single optical isomer in a pair of isomers in these journals.|$|E

25|$|Given an {{abstract}} separable factor, one {{can ask for}} a classification of its modules, meaning the separable Hilbert spaces that it acts on. The answer is given as follows: every such module H can be given an M-dimension dimM(H) (not its dimension as a complex vector space) such that modules are isomorphic if and only <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same M-dimension. The M-dimension is additive, and a module is isomorphic to a subspace of another module {{if and only if}} it has smaller or equal M-dimension.|$|E

25|$|Several studies {{investigated}} {{factors that}} influence the decision to plagiarize. For example, a panel study with students from German universities found that academic procrastination predicts the frequency plagiarism conducted within six months followed the measurement of academic procrastination. It {{has been argued that}} by plagiarizing students cope with the negative consequences that result from academic procrastination such as poor grades. Another study found that plagiarism is more frequent if students perceive plagiarism as beneficial and <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> opportunity to plagiarize. When students had expected higher sanctions and when they had internalized social norms that define plagiarism as very objectionable, plagiarism was less likely to occur.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{one might}} {{like to have a}} direct {{definition}} of the cotangent space without reference to the tangent space. Such a definition can be formulated in terms of equivalence classes of smooth functions on M. Informally, we will say that two smooth functions f and g are equivalent at a point x <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same first-order behavior near x, analogous to their linear Taylor polynomials; two functions f and g have the same first order behaviour near x if and only if the derivative of the function f-g vanishes at x. The cotangent space will then consist of all the possible first-order behaviors of a function near x.|$|E
25|$|In some cases, {{there was}} no {{information}} on the effectiveness for respirators of specific design (type) in the workplace. This {{is due to the}} fact that the measurement of workplace PF is very difficult, time consuming, and expensive work, which was carried out not very often. For these types of respirators experts used the results of WPF measurements of other types of respirators, which are similar. For example, the effectiveness of the Supplied Air Respirators (SARs, with hose) was considered similar to the efficiency of Powered Air Purifying Respirators (PAPRs), <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>have</b> <b>the</b> same facepieces and the same air supply mode. Finally, in the absence of this information, specialists could use the results of Simulated WPF measurements; or estimates of competent experts.|$|E
