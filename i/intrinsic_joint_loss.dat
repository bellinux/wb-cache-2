40|$|Quantum {{mechanics}} violates Leggett-Garg inequalities {{because the}} operator formalism predicts correlations between different spin components that would correspond to negative joint probabilities for {{the outcomes of}} joint measurements. However, the uncertainty principle ensures that such joint measurements cannot be implemented without errors. In a sequential measurement of the spin components, the resolution and back-action errors of the intermediate measurement can be described by random spin flips acting on an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> probability. If the error rates are known, the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> probability can be reconstructed from the noisy statistics of the actual measurement outcomes. In this paper, we use the spin-flip model of measurement errors to analyze experimental data on photon polarization obtained with an interferometric setup {{that allows us to}} vary the measurement strength and hence the balance between resolution and back-action errors. We confirm that the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> probability obtained from the experimental data is independent of measurement strength and show that the same violation of the Leggett-Garg inequality can be obtained for any combination of measurement resolution and back-action.

40|$|Previous {{studies of}} the human stretch reflex have been limited by {{difficulties}} separating the reflex response from those due to passive and <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> properties. This study has presented and experimentally verified a method for separately determining these contributions to the human ankle response, and used this technique to assess the reflex contribution to joint dynamics during {{the application of a}} stochastic position perturbation. Although this method was applied to the human ankle, it is readily applicable to any intact joint. The results of this analysis showed that most of the neuromuscular response could be accounted for by two parallel pathways: one for the stretch reflex dynamics, and another for the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> stiffness. The estimated nonparametric model accounted for 92 % of the measured torque variance between 0. 5 - 25 Hz, and greater than 94 % of the variance between 5 - 12 Hz, where the stretch reflex was found to be most effective...|$|R
40|$|The {{origin of}} non-classical {{correlations}} {{is difficult to}} identify since the uncertainty principle requires that information obtained about one observable invariably results in the disturbance of any other non-commuting observable. Here, this problem is addressed by investigating the uncertainty trade-off between measurement errors and disturbance for measurement interactions controlled {{by the state of}} a single qubit, where the measurement is described by a quantum coherent superposition of a fully projective measurement and the identity operation. It is shown that the measurement statistics obtained from a quantum controlled measurement of A followed by a projective measurement of B can be explained in terms of a simple combination of resolution and back-action errors acting on an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> probability of the non-commuting observables defined by the input state of the system. These <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> probabilities are consistent with the complex-valued joint probabilities recently observed in weak measurements of quantum systems and provide direct evidence of non-commutativity in the form of imaginary correlations between the non-commuting operators. In quantum controlled measurements, these imaginary correlations can be converted into well-defined contributions to the real measurement statistics, allowing a direct experimental observation of the less intuitive aspects of quantum theory.

30|$|DVC {{offers a}} number of {{potential}} advantages which make it well suited for the aforementioned emerging upstream applications. First, it allows for a flexible partitioning of the complexity between the encoder and decoder. Furthermore, due to its <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> source-channel coding framework, DVC is robust to channel errors. Because it does not rely on a prediction loop, DVC provides codec independent scalability. Finally, DVC is well suited for multiview coding by exploiting correlation between views without requiring communications between the cameras, which {{may be an important}} architectural advantage. However, in this case, an important issue is how to generate the joint statistical model describing the multiple views.|$|R
30|$|Another {{appealing}} {{property of}} DVC is its good resilience to transmission errors {{due to its}} <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> source-channel coding framework. A thorough analysis of its performance {{in the presence of}} transmission errors has been presented in [5], showing its good error resilience properties. This results from the fact that DVC is based on a statistical framework rather than the closed-loop prediction used in conventional video coding. Recently, the rapid growth of Internet and wireless communications has led to increased interest for robust transmission of compressed video. However, transmission errors may severely impact video quality as compressed data is very sensitive to these errors [6]. Thus, error control techniques are necessary for efficient video transmission over error prone channels.|$|R

40|$|This {{study was}} aimed at {{examining}} the assumption that three-dimensional (3 D) hand movements follow specific paths that are dictated by the operation of a Listing's law constraint at the <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> level of the arm. A kinematic model was used to simulate hand paths during 3 D point-to-point movements. The model {{was based on the}} assumption that the shoulder obeys a 2 D Listing's constraint and that rotations are about fixed single-axes. The elbow rotations were assumed to relate linearly to those of the shoulder. Both joints were assumed to rotate without reversals, and to start and end rotating simultaneously with zero initial and final velocities. Model predictions were compared to experimental observations made on four right-handed individuals that moved toward virtual objects in "extended arm", "radial", and "frontal plane" movement types. The results showed that the model was partially successful in accounting for the observed behavior. Best hand-path predictions were obtained for extended arm movements followed by radial ones. Frontal plane movements resulted in the largest discrepancies between the predicted and the observed paths. During such movements, the upper arm rotation vectors did not obey Listing's law and this may explain the observed discrepancies. For other movement types, small deviations from the predicted paths were observed which could be explained by the fact that single-axis rotations were not followed even though the rotation vectors remained within Listing's plane. Dynamic factors associated with movement execution, which were not taken into account in our purely kinematic approach, could also explain some of these small discrepancies. In conclusion, a kinematic model based on Listing's law can describe an <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> strategy for the control of arm orientation during pointing and reaching movements, but only in conditions in which the movements closely obey the Listing's plane assumption...|$|R

The safety of the manipulator is analyzed by an analytical worstcase estimation of impact and clamping forces in the absence of collision detection. As <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> compliance can pose a threat by storing energy, a safety evaluation method is proposed taking the potential energy stored in the elastic actuation into account. The evaluation shows that the robot arm design constrains the worst case clamping forces to only 25 N, while being able to handle loads up to 2 kg, and inherits extremely low impact properties, such as an effective mass of less than 0. 4 kg in non near-singular configurations, enabling safe operation even in case of high velocities.

Based on optimal control theory we show that it is possible to significantly and optimally exceed the motor maximum velocity by appropriate motor commands. We solve the problem for models of increasing complexity in order to consecutively elaborate the core insights into the chosen problem.

40|$|AbstractEndothelin 1 (Edn 1) {{signaling}} promotes ventral {{character to}} the facial skeleton. In zebrafish edn 1 mutants, the ventral jaw structures are severely reduced and fused to their dorsal counterparts, with a <b>loss</b> of <b>joints</b> that normally form at an intermediate dorsal–ventral position. Loss of function at another locus, sturgeon, also yields <b>joint</b> <b>losses,</b> but only mild {{reductions in the}} ventral jaw structures. We show that sturgeon encodes one of two orthologs of Furin present in zebrafish, and that both furin genes may function partially redundantly to activate Edn 1 signaling. Supporting this hypothesis, early expression of edn 1 -dependent genes is downregulated in sturgeon (furinA) mutants. Later in development, expression of most of these genes recovers to near wild-type levels in furinA mutants but not in edn 1 mutants. The recovery explains the less severe furinA mutant skeletal phenotype and suggests that late gene expression is dependent on a critical level of Edn 1 signaling not present in the more severe edn 1 mutants. However, expression defects in the intermediate joint-forming domains in both mutants persist, explaining the <b>joint</b> <b>losses</b> observed later in both mutants. We further show that in both mutants the arches fail to correctly undergo ventral elongation before skeletogenesis begins and propose a model in which this failure is {{largely responsible for the}} loss of an Edn 1 -dependent compartmentation of the arch into the intermediate and ventral domains...|$|R
40|$|Joint {{audio-visual}} patterns often {{exist in}} videos and provide strong multi-modal cues for detecting multimedia events. However, conventional methods generally fuse {{the visual and}} audio information only at a superficial level, without adequately exploring deep <b>intrinsic</b> <b>joint</b> patterns. In this paper, we propose a joint audio-visual bi-modal representation, called bi-modal words. We first build a bipartite graph to model relation across the quantized words extracted from the visual and audio modalities. Partitioning over the bipartite graph is then applied to construct the bi-modal words that reveal the joint patterns across modalities. Finally, different pooling strategies are employed to re-quantize the visual and audio words into the bi-modal words and form bimodal Bag-of-Words representations that are fed to subsequent multimedia event classifiers. We experimentally show that the proposed multi-modal feature achieves statistically significant performance gains over methods using individual visual and audio features alone and alternative multi-modal fusion methods. Moreover, we found that average pooling is the most suitable strategy for bi-modal feature generation...|$|R
