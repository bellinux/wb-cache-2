40|$|Ever since Prime Minister David Cameron {{made his}} major speech on Europe on 23 January 2013, {{in which he}} argued {{for some kind of}} new deal between the UK and the EU, the rest of the EU as well as the British public have been {{wondering}} what he would actually propose in operational terms. On 15 March 2014, the Prime Minister offered at least an <b>interim</b> <b>reply</b> to these questions {{in an article in the}} Daily Telegraph newspaper. This paper extracts from the Daily Telegraph article the main ideas that the Prime Minister advances. In all, 10 propositions are identified, presented in the precise language used, followed by an appraisal. The article has not attracted so much attention, mainly because its content is not particularly sensational, but that is its real importance and quality. It points the way towards resolving what otherwise would mean a huge political crisis for the UK and the EU. The Prime Minister gave the overall impression that he is not now heading towards making an impossibly difficult list of demands. On the contrary, an informed and moderate realism seems to be in the making. The package outlined in this paper could be sold in Brussels. There would then have to be a robust communications campaign to sell it to the British public. This paper is part of a series for a CEPS-EPIN project on “The British Question and the Search for a Fresh European Narrative”, which is pegged to an ambitious ongoing exercise by the British government to review all the competences of the European Union. The intention is that this should provide a basis for informed debate before the referendum on the UK remaining in the EU or not, which is scheduled for 2017...|$|E
25|$|A {{subsequent}} State Department message {{stressed the}} need to publicly emphasize {{the fact that the}} coup was an expression of national will by citing the near unanimous support of key military and civilian leaders. The message further stressed the importance of Vice President Nguyễn Ngọc Thơ in a quick return to constitutional rule and the need, therefore, for the junta to include him in an <b>interim</b> regime. Lodge <b>replied</b> affirmatively, indicating the United States should encourage other friendly countries to publicly recognize the new junta first with the assurance that the US would follow suit shortly thereafter. The United States would then resume the Commercial Import Program (CIP) that had been suspended in the meantime. Lodge advised the CIP be resumed quietly to avoid the appearance that it was a payoff for the coup.|$|R
50|$|On 5 October 2001, {{everything}} was ready. Transport Secretary Stephen Byers called Winsor {{to a meeting}} to explain that the government regarded Railtrack as insolvent and that a petition for railway administration in respect of Railtrack would {{be made to the}} High Court in London on 7 October 2001. Winsor expressed surprise that the company could be on the precipice of insolvency, having just had a 50% increase in its allowed revenues in his October 2000 regulatory review, and that the company would not have said anything about its precarious position to its economic regulator who had the power to advance potentially billions of pounds to it in additional revenues. Asked by Winsor whether the chairman of Railtrack knew all this, Byers replied that Robinson would be informed at a meeting immediately after Winsor's interview with the Secretary of State. Winsor told Byers that he would expect Railtrack, upon hearing this news, to immediately apply to him for the promised <b>interim</b> review. Byers <b>replied</b> that any such step would be met by the government introducing emergency legislation into Parliament to take the rail regulator under direct political control, to stop the review taking place. Winsor told Byers of the very severe adverse consequences such a step would involve, but Byers was unmoved. Ministers had made up their minds.|$|R
