5|$|Bone {{grafting}} {{is necessary}} {{when there is}} a lack of bone. While there are always new implant types, such as short implants, and techniques to allow compromise, a general treatment goal is to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> of 10mm in bone height, and 6mm in width. Alternatively, bone defects are graded from A to D (A=10+mm of bone, B=7–9mm, C=4–6mm and D=0–3mm) where an implant's likelihood of osseointegrating is related to the grade of bone.|$|E

5|$|For the {{original}} Final Fantasy, Sakaguchi required a larger production team than Square's previous titles. He began crafting the game's story while experimenting with gameplay ideas. Once the gameplay system and game world size were established, Sakaguchi integrated his story ideas into the available resources. A different {{approach has been}} taken for subsequent titles; the story is completed first and the game built around it. Designers have never been restricted by consistency, though most feel each title should <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> number of common elements. The development teams strive to create completely new worlds for each title, and avoid making new games too similar to previous ones. Game locations are conceptualized early in development and design details like building parts are fleshed out {{as a base for}} entire structures.|$|E
5|$|On 13 July 1965, the {{specification}} for the AFVG {{feasibility study}} was issued; according to Wood, the specification greatly resembled that {{which had been}} earlier issued for the cancelled TSR-2. The AFVG {{was to have a}} maximum speed of 800 knots at sea level and Mach 2.5 at altitude. It was required to possess a minimum combat radium of 500 nautical miles, a ferry range of 3,500 nautical miles, and the nose-mounted airborne interception radar was to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> range of 60 nautical miles. Armanment was to include a pair of 30 mm cannons and a 2,500lb tactical nuclear bomb. However, the specification would be repeatedly re-drafted, the issuing of a definitive specification by Whitehall was delayed until April 1966.|$|E

5|$|On October 23, an open trough was {{centered}} north of Hispaniola near the Turks and Caicos islands. At 0000 UTC the following day, {{the area of}} disturbed weather became organized and was analyzed to have become a tropical storm southeast of Inagua, based on nearby vessel reports. Initially, the storm drifted northward, but later began to accelerate towards the northeast after a roughly 12-hour period. At 0600 UTC on September 25, the disturbance slightly gained in intensity to attain maximum wind speeds of 45 mph (75 km/h); these would be the strongest winds associated with the storm as a fully tropical cyclone. A reanalysis of the system indicated that {{due to a lack}} of definite tropical features, the storm may have had been a subtropical cyclone. On October 26, the system became increasingly asymmetric and had developed frontal boundaries, allowing for it to be classified as an extratropical cyclone at 0600 UTC that day. Once transitioning into an extratropical system, the storm continued to intensified as it moved northward. On October 27, the system was analyzed to <b>have</b> <b>a</b> <b>minimum</b> pressure of at least 985 mbar (hPa; 29.09 inHg) after passing to the southeast of Bermuda. At 1200 UTC later that day, the cyclone reached an extratropical peak intensity with winds of 80 mph (130 km/h) just east of Newfoundland. Had the storm been tropical at the time, it would have been classified as a modern-day Category 1 hurricane. Subsequently, the extratropical storm curved eastward, where it persisted before dissipating by 1800 UTC on September 29.|$|E
