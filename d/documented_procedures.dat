New for the 2015 release is a requirement for an organization to assess risks and opportunities (section 6.1) and to determine internal and external issues relevant to its purpose and strategic direction (section 4.1). The organization must demonstrate how the standard’s requirements are being met, while the external auditor’s role is to determine the quality management system's effectiveness.

Also depending on type the societies request 1 or 2 operators. The UTM operators need to be Level II certified according with SNT-TC-1A or similar standard. Also the company that performs the ultrasonic thickness measurement survey {{must be approved by}} the classification that the vessel is registered with.

50|$|It {{was planned}} that the coin would {{continue}} using the voyageur theme of its predecessor, but the master dies {{that had been}} struck in Ottawa were lost in transit {{en route to the}} Mint's facility at Winnipeg.

It was also found to be the third time that the Mint had lost master dies within five years. An internal review by the Royal Canadian Mint argued that while a policy existed to ship the obverse and reverse dies separately, the new coin dies were packaged separately but were part of the same shipment. The Mint also disagreed with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police's contention that the dies were simply lost in transit, believing instead that they were stolen. The dies were never recovered.|$|E

5000|$|In April 1997 the {{hospital}} was chastised by federal investigators from the United States Health Care Financing Administration for several patient deaths and dangerous understaffing, among a 104 total violations. The deaths were investigated by the California Department of Health Services {{on behalf of the}} USHCFA and were found to be the fault of {{the hospital}}. In fact the California Nurses Association had already reported repeatedly and to no avail that the hospitals were understaffed especially for critical care positions. Kaiser claimed the nurses' complaints were motivated based on Kaiser's plan to reduce their salary and benefits, while the CNA contended they had been complaining for at least 2 years before their labor disagreement came into play. Richmond Medical Center was also censured for sending patients to other hospitals via their own cars and not ambulances, even if they were alone and in labor, as a common practice. Further violations for the hospital that were described by investigators and itself as [...] "deficient" [...] including poor recordkeeping, no standardized nor <b>documented</b> <b>procedures,</b> and understaffing of nurses in the emergency department.|$|E
5000|$|Signer’s [...] "action sculptures" [...] involve setting up, {{carrying}} out, {{and recording}} [...] "experiments" [...] or events that bear aesthetic results. Day-to-day {{objects such as}} umbrellas, tables, boots, containers, hats and bicycles are part of Signer’s working vocabulary. Following carefully planned and strictly executed and <b>documented</b> <b>procedures,</b> the artist enacts and records such acts as explosions, collisions, and the projection of objects through space. Signer advocates ‘controlled destruction, not destruction for its own sake’. Action Kurhaus Weissbad (1992) saw chairs catapulted out of a hotel’s windows; Table (1994) launched a table into the sea on four buckets; Kayak (2000) featured the artist being towed down a road in a canoe. In documenta 8 (1987), he catapulted thousands of sheets of paper into the air to create an ephemeral wall in the room for a brief, but all the more intense moment. As the Swiss representative at the Venice Biennale in 1999, he made 117 steel balls fall from the ceiling on to lumps of clay lying on the ground. Many of his happenings are not for public viewing, and are only documented in photos and film. Video works like Stiefel mit Rakete (Boot with Rocket) are integral to Signer’s performances, capturing the original setup of materials that self-destruct {{in the process of}} creating an emotionally and visually compelling event.|$|E
40|$|Construction {{contracts}} are essentially carried out as projects. In project situation, improvement of work practices {{can take place}} in two ways: within a project and from one project to another. As repetitive work is very much less in construction contracts compared to manufacturing environment, most significant improvements of quality usually take place on project-to-project basis. Documentation and <b>documented</b> <b>procedures</b> can playa major role in such a situation. <b>Documented</b> <b>procedures</b> establish the current practices or the baseline for continual improvement; documentation enables recording lessons from projects that are success as well as failures. The improvement of work practices in this manner is known to increase the project management maturity of a contractor organization. The level of project management maturity usually assesses an organization's current project management practices and processes {{and its ability to}} achieve project objectives in terms of quality, cost and time. This report presents a comparative study on the usage of project management practices in construction contracts and the relationship between <b>documented</b> <b>procedures</b> and the project management maturity. The objectives of the study were (a) to identify the areas which have a greater need for documented procedures; (b) to assess the usage of project management practices in construction contracts; (c) to assess the level of project management maturity of construction organizations; and (d) to establish the relationship between <b>documented</b> <b>procedures</b> and project management maturity. Questionnaire surveys were used to collect necessary data from the construction professionals and different construction organizations. The results of the first survey suggest that construction companies can benefit significantly by implementing <b>documented</b> <b>procedures</b> in the areas of all quality elements of ISO 9000, health and safety and risk management. The second survey was carried out to assess the level of project management maturity achieved by implementing a set of <b>documented</b> <b>procedures</b> and project management tools and techniques and practices. The results of this survey show that project management maturity is significantly high for construction companies in certain knowledge areas such as time management, cost management and procurement management; whereas it is comparatively low with respect to the management of risk, communication and quality of projects. Further, the results suggest that there is a positive relationship between the implementation of <b>documented</b> <b>procedures</b> and the level of project management maturity among contractor organizations. Also the implementation of <b>documented</b> <b>procedures</b> could improve their project management maturity and ability to achieve customer satisfaction. Further, personal interviews were conducted to verify the findings of the questionnaire. survey. Findings & conclusions from this study could be useful for the contractor organizations to identify strategies to increase their PM maturity and thereby to improve their potential to meet stakeholder requirements and successful completion of projects undertaken by them.
