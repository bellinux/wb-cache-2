5|$|Despite this he {{had neither}} an office nor office staff, {{dealing with all}} the {{correspondence}} himself. Much of the detail of his works were held in his memory. He travelled with a personal valet and later had a cashier. But all his letters were written by him; it is recorded that on one occasion after {{the rest of his}} party had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> 31 letters had been written by Brassey overnight. Although he won a large number of contracts, his bids were not always successful. It has been calculated that for every contract awarded, around six others had been unsuccessful.|$|E
5|$|Garran {{joked that}} the long work of the {{drafting}} committee breached the Factory Acts, the group (primarily Barton, Richard O'Connor, John Downer and Garran) often working {{late into the night}} preparing drafts for the convention to consider and debate the next morning. On the evening before the convention's last day, Barton had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> exhausted in the small hours, Garran and Charles Gavan Duffy finishing the final schedule of amendments at breakfast time. The convention concluded successfully, approving a final draft which would ultimately, aside from a small amendment arranged at the last minute in London, become the Constitution of Australia.|$|E

5|$|Green {{told police}} that she had one or two drinks after dinner and went to her bedroom, leaving it only to speak to Tim in the kitchen some time between ten and eleven in the evening, shortly {{before he went to}} bed. Kelly and Kate had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> earlier, each taking one of the family's two dogs with them. Green said that she had fallen asleep around eleven-thirty. At some point before falling asleep, she recalled, she had spoken to Farrar, who had phoned asking which member of the {{household}} had paged him. She {{told police that}} she and Farrar {{were in the process of}} divorce, though she did not know how far along they were, and that although the children were very upset at the prospect, she herself was not and was looking forward to being able to rebuild her life.|$|E

As she reaches the little bed, the clock strikes midnight and she looks up to see Drosselmeyer perched atop it. Suddenly, mice begin to fill the room and the Christmas tree begins to grow to dizzying heights. The nutcracker also grows to life size. Clara finds herself {{in the midst of a}} battle between an army of gingerbread soldiers and the mice, led by their king. They begin to eat the soldiers.|$|E
25|$|In central Serbia, {{once the}} {{household}} members have <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> {{an elderly woman}} of the family sticks a knife into the house door from the inside. Alternatively, she puts a hawthorn stake by the door, hanging a wreath of garlic on it. This is done as a protection against curses, witches, and demons. For the same reason, children are rubbed with garlic on the palms, armpits, and soles before going to bed. In some regions, the men keep watch in shifts by the fireplace during the night, to keep the fire burning.|$|E
25|$|Entwistle died in Room 658 at the Hard Rock Hotel and Casino in Las Vegas, Nevada, on 27 June 2002, one {{day before}} the {{scheduled}} first show of the Who's 2002 United States tour. He had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> that night with a stripper/groupie, who woke that morning to find Entwistle cold and unresponsive. The Clark County medical examiner determined that his death was due to a heart attack induced by a cocaine overdose. His funeral was held at St Edward's Church in Stow-on-the-Wold, Gloucestershire, England, on 10 July 2002. He was cremated and his ashes were buried privately. A memorial service was held on 24 October at St. Martin-in-the-Fields, Trafalgar Square, London. Entwistle's huge collection of guitars and basses was auctioned at Sotheby's in London by his son, Christopher, to meet anticipated taxes on his father's estate.|$|E

500|$|Detectives {{noted that}} during her {{interview}} Green {{did not appear}} to be or have been crying, and her manner was [...] "talkative, even cheerful". She repeatedly referred to Tim and Kelly Farrar in the past tense, and referred to all of her children by their ages rather than their names. Her accounts of times from the previous evening varied, and she seemed uncertain what time she had done things like <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|E
500|$|McClellan further damaged his {{reputation}} by his insulting insubordination to his commander-in-chief. He privately referred to Lincoln, {{whom he had}} known before the war as {{a lawyer for the}} Illinois Central, as [...] "nothing more than a well-meaning baboon", a [...] "gorilla", and [...] "ever unworthy of ... his high position." [...] On November 13, he snubbed the president, who had come to visit McClellan's house, by making him wait for 30 minutes, only to be told that the general had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and could not receive him.|$|E
500|$|As Titanic {{approached}} her fatal collision, most passengers had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> and {{command of the}} bridge had passed from Second Officer Charles Lightoller to First Officer William Murdoch. Lookouts Frederick Fleet and Reginald Lee were occupying the crow's nest, [...] above the deck. The air temperature had fallen to near freezing, and the ocean was completely calm. Colonel Archibald Gracie, one of {{the survivors of the}} disaster, later wrote that [...] "the sea was like glass, so smooth that the stars were clearly reflected." [...] It is now known that such exceptionally calm water is a sign of nearby pack ice.|$|E

500|$|At {{some time}} during the night of 24/25 November 1974, Nick Drake died at his home ("Far Leys") in Tanworth-in-Arden, from an {{overdose}} of amitriptyline, a type of antidepressant. He had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> early after spending the afternoon visiting a friend. His mother said that around dawn he left his room for the kitchen. His family was used to hearing him do this many times before but, during this instance, he {{did not make a}} sound. They presumed he was eating a bowl of cereal. He returned to his room a short while later, and took some pills [...] "to help him sleep".|$|E
500|$|He died {{suddenly}} {{at his home}} in Chichester on 28 February 1819. His obituary reported that he had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed</b> [...] "in good health, and was seized by a spasmodic affectation in his chest, which terminated his existence at 8o'clock". The Naval Chronicle declared that Admiral Murray's [...] disposition is so gentle, and his manners are so mild, that but few men are equally well beloved in the navy; while few possess the facility of commanding with such ease, and, at the same time, with such energy and effect. His wife Ann outlived him by a considerable number of years. She died in Boulogne in 1859, at the age of 95.|$|E
500|$|In April 2008, {{the coroner}} {{recorded}} a verdict of [...] {{in relation to}} Collins.

The inquest found that she had taken [...] "very significant" [...] amounts of cocaine with sleeping pills and vodka, and that she had suffered 60% burns to her body, including her tongue. The coroner noted that at some stage in the night after both Speight and Collins had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> Collins got up to have a bath. He said that it was [...] "more likely than not" [...] that a heart problem had caused Collins to fall unconscious while the hot tap was running. Following Collins's death, Speight moved in with Collins's mother.|$|E

I recall broadcasting home from the ground... describing the scene of desolation with part of the playing arena still under a foot of water...

2500|$|On {{the night}} of June 23, 1855, after {{the rest of his}} family had <b>gone</b> <b>to</b> <b>bed,</b> Robert Newsom came to Celia‚Äôs cabin, as he had told her he would. Celia made an attempt to reject his sexual advances, and when he refused to back down, she clubbed him over the head with the stick that she had brought into her cabin earlier that day. After she hit him the first time, he reached out his arms as if he was trying to grab her and she clubbed him a second time, killing him. She then moved his body into her {{fireplace}} and {{spent the rest of the}} night burning his remains. She crushed some of Newsom‚Äôs smaller bones with a rock, and hid the bones that were too big to crush ‚Äúunder the hearth, and under the floor between a sleeper and the fire-place.‚Äù The next morning, Celia enlisted the help of Newsom‚Äôs grandson, twelve-year-old Coffee Wainscott, in scattering the ashes of Robert Newsom.
