25|$|In most of Canada, either partner may informally {{assume the}} spouse's surname after marriage, {{so long as}} it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> {{purposes}} of fraud. The same is true for people in common-law relationships, in some provinces. This is not considered a legal name change in most provinces, excluding British Columbia. For federal purposes, such as a Canadian passport, Canadians may also assume their partner's surname if they are in a common-law relationship. In the province of British Columbia, people have to undergo a legal name change if they want to use a combined surname after marriage. Their marriage certificate is considered proof of their new name.|$|E
25|$|However, the {{judiciary}} {{has used its}} power to adjudge executive actions and Acts of Parliament unconstitutional and void rather sparingly. To date, the only instance where the High Court struck down a statutory provision was in Taw Cheng Kong v. Public Prosecutor (1998). It was short-lived, as the decision was later overturned by the Court of Appeal. Delivering the Court's judgment, Chief Justice Yong Pung How emphasized the limits of judicial review, stating that it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> courts to dictate the scope and ambit of a section or rule on its propriety. This is a matter which only Parliament can decide, and the courts can only interpret what is enacted. This results in a conflict between the court's responsibility {{to be faithful to}} the Constitution, and its apparently restricted role in reviewing legislation.|$|E

This is illustrated by Campaign for Nuclear Disarmament, {{in which it was}} held that for the court to assume jurisdiction in such areas would be an [...] "exorbitant arrogation of adjudicative power", as the court could not presume that its ruling would bind other states. Another non-justiciable area is where the legislature {{has made it clear that}} a particular question is reserved to the executive to answer, as in Singapore Airlines which noted that section18 of the State Immunity Act requires those claiming sovereign immunity from lawsuits to first obtain certification from the Singapore Government. In such situations, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>for</b> <b>the</b> court to disregard the executive's judgment.|$|E

But Rajamouli excels in story-telling. The way he has used the {{flashback}} as a flip switch, going back and forth and taking the viewer through a 400-year journey in a jiffy is interesting. The rest is about how well technology, creativity, imagination and innovation are leveraged to present what is an eye-pleasing experience for viewers." [...] B. V. S. Prakash of The Times of India wrote, [...] "Despite a few narrative lapses, the much-hyped semi-periodic epic lives up to expectations. Unlike his previous action-centric films, director Rajamouli dishes a heart-touching love story in a lavish canvas convincingly. Also kudos for the way he has visualised and presented the film." [...] He added, [...] "After not-so-impressive Chirutha, Ram Charan Tej returns as a valiant soldier and breathes life into the larger-than-life role with ease. Similarly, Kajal known for simple lover girl roles transforms into a determined princess and truly impresses. Dev Gil is adequate as the ruthless villain", and rated the film 3 out of 5.|$|E

Greg Kot of the Chicago Tribune acknowledged it as the [...] "speed metal prototype", but felt the lyrical replication of Judas Priest and the Misfits kept the album short from becoming a classic. In a retrospective review, Billboard praised Kill 'Em All for changing the face of popular music with its unique combination of punk and metal. AllMusic's Steve Huey called it [...] "the true birth of thrash". He praised Hetfield's highly technical rhythm guitar style and said that the band was [...] "playing with tightly controlled fury even at the most ridiculously fast tempos". Rob Kemp, writing in The Rolling Stone Album Guide, credited the album for consolidating the punk rock and heavy metal scenes, but felt that apart from [...] "Seek & Destroy" [...] and [...] "(Anesthesia) - Pulling Teeth", most of the album had the band [...] "trying to look tough" [...] over enthusiastic but unfinished riff-based songs. Journalist Martin Popoff said Kill 'Em All differentiated from the debuts by Metallica's Bay Area contemporaries because the fans could identify with Hetfield's lyrics and the band's appearance. Spins Chuck Eddy considered Kill 'Em All the inception of the [...] "extreme metal mania" [...] of the early 1980s. He noted the album did not receive much critical praise {{at the time of its}} release, but said it aged well and opened the doors for the less commercially successful bands. Although McIver credits Venom's Welcome to Hell (1981) as the first thrash metal album, he acknowledged Kill 'Em All as a major influence on the flourishing American heavy metal scene. Despite its [...] "less-than-perfect" [...] production, Loudwires Jon Wiederhorn said that Kill 'Em All sounds like an [...] "influential slice of history" [...] and stands on the same level as classic albums by Black Sabbath, Iron Maiden, and Judas Priest.|$|E
