"No, father, it was me," [...] {{answered}} Hetty, who {{was engaged}} in stirring something <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>saucepan,</b> the loose handle of which was attached to its battered body by only one rivet; the other rivet had given way on an occasion when Ned Frog sent it flying through the doorway after his retreating wife.

The thermos flask, the various sandwiches, four apples, and a little tin of butter. So much for the kitchenino, for myself and the queen bee. Then my knapsack and the q-b's handbag.|$|R

In separate mixing bowl, sift 3 cups of flour, then add 2 1/2 tsp. salt, 1 tsp. sugar. Add milk mixture to flour. Mix well, then add additional flour and kneed.

Form dough into small balls the size of a walnut, placing one dough ball on top of another to form a snowman shape; the ball on the top should be slightly smaller than the one on the bottom.

60|$|At last, her eye {{rested on}} an article which stood upon the table, {{and she started}} up impetuously from her chair. She did this so suddenly, that the doctor's hand fell beside him before {{he knew that she}} had risen. The table was covered with all those {{implements}} which become so frequent about a house when severe illness is an inhabitant there. There were little boxes and apothecaries' bottles, cups and saucers standing separate, and bowls, in which messes have been prepared with the hope of suiting a sick man's failing appetite. There was <b>a</b> <b>small</b> <b>saucepan</b> standing on <b>a</b> plate, a curiously shaped glass utensil left by the doctor, and sundry pieces of flannel, which had been used in rubbing the sufferer's limbs. But {{in the middle of the}} débris stood one black bottle, with head erect, unsuited to the companionship in which it was found.|$|R
5000|$|During the Great Patriotic War the Soviet army mess kit was a two-piece design {{similar to}} that used by the Wehrmacht forces that {{consisted}} of a large main canteen part, and <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> <b>saucepan</b> component that also doubled as the mess tin lid. The kit also had a wire handle which many soldiers used to hang the mess kit from their web equipment or backpack. This design was supplemented in the mid-1980s with a second design that featured a metal water bottle held in the middle. The next layer of the set was a large canteen / cooking pot with a wire handle, then <b>a</b> <b>smaller</b> saucepan-type component with a folding metal handle. This last component fitted over the base of the larger cooking pot, the handle was then folded up and clipped over the cooking pot and the lip of the water bottle. The mess set was sometimes issued with a pouch, although this was by no means certain and many soldiers simply hung it onto their equipment from the wire handle. Officers were often issued a satchel-type bag for their mess kits in keeping with their smart image. This latest design of mess kit continues to be used today in the army of the Russian Federation and doubtless [...] is still used in the armies of former Soviet republics.|$|R
5000|$|In 14th- and 15th-century cookery manuals, a possibly-related word spelled {{variously}} [...] "possenet", [...] "postnet", or [...] "posnet" [...] {{is used to}} mean <b>a</b> <b>small</b> pot or <b>saucepan.</b> <b>In</b> 16th-century and later sources, possets are generally made from lemon or other citrus juice, cream and sugar. Eggs are often added. Some recipes used breadcrumbs to thicken the beverage.|$|R
60|$|By {{protruding}} {{his head}} a little he commanded, through the foliage of a festooning creeper, {{a view of the}} three bungalows. Irregularly disposed along a flat curve, over the veranda rail of the farthermost one hung a dark rug of a tartan pattern, amazingly conspicuous. Ricardo could see the very checks. A brisk fire of sticks was burning on {{the ground in front of}} the steps, and in the sunlight the thin, fluttering flame had paled almost to invisibility--a mere rosy stir under a faint wreath of smoke. He could see the white bandage on the head of Pedro bending over it, and the wisps of black hair standing up weirdly. He had wound that bandage himself, after breaking that shaggy and enormous head. The creature balanced it like a load, staggering towards the steps. Ricardo could see <b>a</b> <b>small,</b> long-handled <b>saucepan</b> at the end of a great hairy paw.|$|R
5000|$|José López-Rey {{suggests}} that this picture {{could be related to}} a lost Velázquez painting described by Antonio Palomino..."where a board is seen, that serves as a table, with a charcoal burner, and a pot boiling on top, and covered with a bowl, and the fire is visible, the flames, and the sparks are clearly visible, <b>a</b> <b>small</b> tin <b>saucepan,</b> <b>an</b> alcarraza, some plates, and some basins, a glazed jug, a mortar with its pestle and a head of garlic next to it; and on the wall there is <b>small</b> basket and <b>a</b> cloth hanging from a hook, and other trinkets; and guarding this is a boy holding a jug, wearing a coif, who with his humble clothes represents a subject that is very ridiculous and amusing". The Dublin version was bequeathed by Alfred Beit <b>in</b> 1987. <b>A</b> 1933 cleaning revealed a depiction of Jesus’ supper at Emmaus on the wall behind the main figure.|$|R
