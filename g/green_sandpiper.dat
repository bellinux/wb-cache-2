500|$|There {{are eight}} main pools in the reserve, {{some of which}} are {{maintained}} to support specific flora or fauna. [...] At the centre of the reserve is East Marsh Pool, the largest of the pools, which contains two islands. Tern Island is composed of gravel and pebbles which attracts certain species to breed here, notably common tern and little ringed plover. [...] There are also a number of artificial rafts on the pool, again to induce common tern to breed; eight pairs did so in 2008. Willow Island is much larger and more grassy, providing suitable areas for lapwing, common redshank and <b>green</b> <b>sandpiper.</b> The existence of the islands helps to prevent the nests of species such as these being predated by foxes. There are three hides overlooking the pool. [...] An artificial structure alongside the pool is designed to attract sand martins to breed, as they did when the gravel quarry was operational; this was successful {{for the first time in}} 2009, with eight nestholes occupied and over 40 young fledged.|$|E
2500|$|The name [...] "Peper Harow" [...] is {{very unusual}} and comes from Old English Pipers Hear(g) perhaps meaning, {{approximately}} [...] "The pagan stone altar of the pipers"; however, hearg {{can also be}} haeg meaning more prosaically hedged enclosure (of the pipers), or even hay meadow. Pipers might mean musicians, or sandpipers (the <b>green</b> <b>sandpiper</b> and wood sandpiper are migrants to marsh and swampy ground â€“ as this is).|$|E
5000|$|The <b>green</b> <b>sandpiper</b> (Tringa ochropus) {{is a small}} wader (shorebird) of the Old World. The genus name Tringa is the New Latin name {{given to}} the <b>green</b> <b>sandpiper</b> by Aldrovandus in 1599 based on Ancient Greek trungas, a thrush-sized, white-rumped, tail-bobbing wading bird {{mentioned}} by Aristotle. The specific ochropus is from Ancient Greek okhros, [...] "ochre", and pous, [...] "foot".|$|E
50|$|Birds are various: common goldeneyes, mallards, gadwalls, {{northern}} pintails, anas, ruddy shelducks, charadrii, northern lapwings, common <b>sandpipers,</b> <b>green</b> <b>sandpipers.</b> Ducks are massively presents in automn on the lakes, during migration period.|$|R

Other migrants have included osprey and hobby. Breeding summer visitors include yellow wagtail.|$|R
50|$|The sites has lagoons {{which are}} fed by springs, so they never freeze over {{and provide an}} {{important}} habitat for birds in cold winters. There are two bird hides, and birds which can be seen include water rails, snipe and <b>green</b> <b>sandpipers.</b> There are also water shrews and around fifty species of water snails. Other habitats are meadow, hedgerows, marsh and willow woodland.|$|R

50|$|This {{site has}} been {{grassland}} {{for the last}} 100 years, and it is grazed by cows and sheep. The site has ponds, creeks and ditches, and a 20 hectare field is flooded during the winter, providing feeding grounds for large numbers of wildfowl and wading birds, including around 2000 Brent geese. Other winter birds include lapwings, golden plovers and dunlins, while there are spring migrants such as <b>green</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and spotted redshanks, and breeding birds such as skylarks and meadow pipits. Mammals include water voles and hares, and many butterflies.|$|R
5|$|Swans {{and geese}} usually start {{to arrive in}} late October. Passage waders in the autumn include red knot, godwit, dunlin, ringed and grey plovers, ruff, common greenshank, spotted redshank, curlew sandpiper and common, wood and <b>green</b> <b>sandpipers.</b> Besides Bewick's swan and flocks of white-fronted geese, large {{waterfowl}} regularly present in the reserve in winter include the Brant goose, pink-footed goose, barnacle goose and Taiga bean goose.

Smaller wildfowl present in winter include wigeon, Eurasian teal, common pochard, northern pintail, water rail, dunlin, redshank, curlew, golden plover, snipe and ruff.|$|R
5000|$|Anton Crescent Wetland has ponds, willow carr and reedbeds, and {{the ponds}} never dry {{out as the}} rock {{formation}} is Oxford Clay. The pools and mud provide a habitat for birds such as the <b>green</b> <b>sandpiper</b> and common snipe.|$|E
50|$|The <b>green</b> <b>sandpiper</b> {{is one of}} {{the species}} to which the Agreement on the Conservation of African-Eurasian Migratory Waterbirds (AEWA) applies. Widely {{distributed}} and not uncommon, it is not considered a threatened species by the IUCN on a global scale.|$|E
50|$|This {{is not a}} gregarious species, {{although}} sometimes {{small numbers}} congregate in suitable feeding areas. <b>Green</b> <b>sandpiper</b> {{is very much a}} bird of freshwater, and is often found in sites too restricted for other waders, which tend to like a clear all-round view.|$|E
50|$|On the {{doorstep}} of the Peak District, the reservoir (as well as the surrounding woodland) is owned by United Utilities and supplies the town of Macclesfield with drinking water. Although a working environment, the area is a haven for wildlife. Perhaps {{best known for its}} heronry (thought to be the largest in the Peak District, with over 20 breeding pairs), the reserve is also home to ravens and birds of prey. Red deer are shy residents of the forest but can often be seen drinking from the reservoir in early morning. Changing water levels occasionally expose the reservoir banks, which become a popular feeding ground for small wading birds, including common <b>sandpipers,</b> <b>green</b> <b>sandpipers</b> and little ringed plovers. Flocks of crossbills are regularly seen feeding in the treetops, and winter visitors include goldeneyes and goosanders.|$|R

During periods of low tide the expansive areas of mud attract birds {{such as the}} little grebe and little egret. The two shallower pools attract wading birds, especially <b>green</b> and common <b>sandpipers.</b> In winter, and variety of wildfowl feed at the site including smew, scaup, black-necked grebe and dunlin.|$|R
