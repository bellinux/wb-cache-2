Until now, {{it is not possible to}} predict if these remains will stay intact under the pressure of a manmade structure like an embankment. The goal of this research is to investigate the behaviour of assemblies of artificial archaeological remains during a one-dimensional compression test. The loads applied to the grains are similar to the loads under an embankment. Emmer wheat seeds, carbonized up to 270 ° C, 290 ° C and 370 ° C, have been assembled in a PEEK oedometer and were subjected to different loading stages with a maximum of 540 kPa. A total of four tests have been performed, one on each type of seed and a second test on the 290 °C seeds, the latter being scanned with a micro CT-scanner in between every loading stage to be able to see individual <b>grain</b> <b>behaviour</b> in a 3 D model. A comparison between the macroscopic yield stress (100 kPa for the second test on the 290 ° C grains) and the microscopic <b>grain</b> <b>behaviour</b> did not show clear resemblance because the point of yielding was not recognized in the 3 D images.

To make a steady bore in the laboratory, a conveyor-belt type of flume with a movable bed was constructed. By setting the belt speed to that of the bore front, a static debris bore was obtained. In addition flow of zero mean velocity was obtained by setting the belt speed to that of the mean flow velocity for a selected slope. In this way detailed observations of <b>grain</b> <b>behaviour</b> over long periods were possible with improved measurement accuracy.

40|$|Grain {{boundary}} (GB), {{a special}} solid-solid interface in materials, exists in all polycrystalline materials, thereby being {{closely related to}} physical, chemical and mechanical properties (conductivity, catalysis, segregation, corrosion, ductility and strength etc) of the polycrystalline materials, especially in ultra fine and nano crystalline materials. In the present study, the molecular dynamics method {{has been used to}} simulate the <b>grain</b> boundary deformation <b>behaviours,</b> which include <b>grain</b> boundary sliding (GBS) <b>behaviour,</b> <b>grain</b> boundary coupling <b>behaviour</b> and the interaction between grain boundaries and dislocations. The following results have been obtained. First, <b>grain</b> boundary sliding <b>behaviour</b> was strongly sensitive to the temperature. At low temperature, the GBS was very sensitive to the imposed ways of external applied forces. However, at high temperature, the two grains smoothly slid away from each other in the way of viscous grain boundary sliding under the shear deformation. Regardless of the type of driving force and misorientation, the bicrystal system tended to resist the applied force by GB rotation. Moreover, the grain boundary rotated among some of the Σ 5 asymmetrical and symmetrical tilt GB boundaries under shear deformation and led to the normal stress σxx in the bicrystal system. Under particular circumstances, reaction of the grain boundary dislocations during shear deformation could release uncommon edge lattice dislocations from the grain boundary.

30|$|Apart {{from the}} effects of pollen {{shedding}} and dispersal and pollen <b>grain</b> <b>behaviour,</b> deposition is also acceptor-dependent. Pollen deposition onto leaves is thus specific to plant species and morphology. Plant growth and environmental conditions influence pollen density as well. These factors collectively cause pollen deposition onto leaves to be highly variable, complicating the interpretation of observed deposition. To obtain pollen exposure data that are comparable, additional standardised measurement methods must be used to record aerial pollen concentration and deposition at a given site [19, 45 – 48]. In this study, we performed parallel measurements of pollen concentration and deposition using standardised technical sampling methods involving a PMO volumetric pollen monitor [10, 37, 39] and PMF passive pollen samplers [9, 19, 47]. These parallel measurements allowed plant-specific leaf deposition to be linked to pollen release, aerial concentration and deposition. The parallel measurements were conducted in later-flowering field B, where anthesis began on 3 August.|$|E
40|$|Intergranular stress {{corrosion}} cracking (IGSCC) is a fracture mechanism in sensitised austenitic stainless steels exposed to critical environments where the intergranular cracks extends along the network of connected susceptible grain boundaries. A constitutive model is presented to estimate the maximum intergranular crack growth by taking into consideration the materials mechanical properties and microstructure characters distribution. This constitutive model is constructed {{based on the assumption}} that each grain is a two phase material comprising of grain interior and grain boundary zone. The inherent micro-mechanisms active in the grain interior during IGSCC is based on crystal plasticity theory, while the grain boundary zone has been modelled by proposing a phenomenological constitutive model motivated from cohesive zone modelling approach. Overall, response of the representative volume is calculated by volume averaging of individual <b>grain</b> <b>behaviour.</b> Model is assessed by performing rigorous parametric studies, followed by validation and verification of the proposed constitutive model using representative volume element based FE simulations reported in the literature.

As such they are becoming an increasingly important tool in the biological community. However, current efforts in the stochastic simulation of biological networks are hampered by two main problems: firstly the lack of complete knowledge of kinetic parameters; and secondly the computational cost of the simulations. In this paper we investigate these problems using the framework of stochastic Petri nets. We present a new stochastic Petri net simulation tool NASTY which allows large numbers of stochastic simulations {{to be carried out}} in parallel. We then begin to address the important problem of incomplete knowledge of kinetic parameters by developing a distributed genetic algorithm, based on NASTY's simulation engine, to parameterise stochastic networks.

We report {{the results of a}} dating study, focussing on the characterisation of the optically stimulated luminescence (OSL) and infrared stimulated luminescence (IRSL) properties of quartz- and potassium-rich feldspar grains. Quartz has previously proven troublesome for dating in East Africa. We identified five general types of quartz <b>grain</b> <b>behaviour,</b> based on the shapes of their OSL decay and dose–response curves. Dose recovery experiments and measurement of the natural samples revealed particular problems with quartz grains that had hyperbolic dose–response curves, low characteristic saturation doses and anomalously large changes in sensitivity between regenerative-dose cycles. The use of pulsed irradiation during measurement and standard and additional quality-assurance criteria during data analysis reduced the number of grains that suffered from these problems. We applied these procedures to individual grains of quartz from eight samples and, using appropriate statistical models, identified post-depositional mixing in three samples. The remaining samples had scattered equivalent-dose distributions typical of quartz grains that had received variable beta dose rates during burial. Stratigraphically consistent OSL ages were obtained for all but the deepest sample. Feldspar ages were estimated for the latter sample and three other samples, using the elevated temperature IRSL signal that exhibited low rates of anomalous fading. Fading-corrected feldspar ages for the latter three samples are consistent with their single-grain quartz ages, but single-grain dating is needed to address problems of post-depositional mixing...|$|E
40|$|An {{experimental}} study is presented here {{to understand the}} stress transmission characteristics under different geometrical arrangements of particulates inside a narrow chamber subjected to axial compression loading. The multi-grain systems considered here are face-centred, simple cubic and poly-dispersed structures, as well as inclusions embedded inside seeded, unseeded and cohesive powder bed of Durcal (calcium carbonate). The distribution of the maximum shear stress, direction of the major principal stress and shear stress concentration factor were obtained using photo stress analysis tomography (PSAT). The {{results show that the}} maximum shear stress distribution in the simple cubic structure is chain-like and self-repetitive, i. e, a single <b>grain</b> <b>behaviour</b> is representative of the whole system. This is not the case in the case of other granular packing. In the case of the inclusion surrounded by powder media, the maximum shear stress distribution in the inclusion occurs through ring-like structures, which are different from those observed in the structured granular packing. This tendency increases for an increase in the cohesivity of the surrounding particulates. In the granular systems, the direction of the major principal stress is mostly orthogonal to the direction of loading except in some particles in the random granular packing. In the case of inclusion surrounded by Durcal particulates, the directional of the major principal stress acts along the direction of the axial loading except in the ring region where this tends to be oblique to the direction of axial loading. Estimates of the shear stress concentration factor (k) show that, k tends to be independent of the structural arrangement of granular packing at higher load levels. In the case of inclusion surrounded by powder bed, k for the seeded granulated particulate bed is mostly independent of the external load levels. In the case of unseeded particulate (granulated) bed, a fluctuation in k is observed with the loading level. This suggests that the seeded granules could distribute stresses in a stable manner without much change in the nature of shear stress-transmitting fabric of the particulate contacts under external loading. An increase in the cohesion of particulate bed results in more plastic deformation as shown by the differential shear stress concentration factor. The results reported in this study show the usefulness of optical stress analysis to shed some scientific lights on unravelling some of the complexities of particulate systems under different structural arrangements of grains and surrounding conditions of the inclusions in particulate media...|$|E
40|$|Continuous {{processes}} {{present the}} benefit to be {{safer and more}} cost saving than batch processes. Many researches {{have been carried out}} in fine chemistry but few contributions refer to polymerization. We focus on the vinyl chloride suspension polymerization. This process has been extensively studied in batch with lots of improvement regarding the formulation and the technologies. This polymerization process is highly complex due to the toxic nature of the monomer, the good manage of heat transfer and stirring. Moreover the reaction step remains the only batch step of the PVC production. According to the PVC grain formation, the process can be divided into three steps (i) a liquid-liquid dispersion step in which the monomer droplet (30 - 50 µm) are generated and stabilized, (ii) a controlled agglomeration step of the reacting droplets exhibiting a sticky behaviour, (iii) a reaction step until the conversion rate is around 80 - 90 % and the particles size is stable. In this study, the different technologies suitable for the different steps are pointed out. Based {{on the state of the}} art of the <b>grain</b> <b>behaviour</b> depending on the reaction conversion and on the literature concerning polymerization continuous process, static mixers and different co-current pulsed columns are proposed. Three technologies with different model system were chosen to study the liquid-liquid dispersion step. Static mixers allow the control of the droplet size under turbulent flow. In the range of the operating conditions, the dispersed phase concentration does not have a significant effect on the droplet size. The interfacial tension appears to be the most significant physico-chemical parameters. Correlation to predict the mean droplet size is proposed depending on different dimensionless numbers based on the hydrodynamics and on the systems: the Reynolds and Weber numbers. Given the promising results, static mixers are implemented at pilot scale to load the batch prior to polymerization. Their use demonstrates a noticeable reduction of the loading time and a better homogenisation of the different suspending agents and initiator inside the PVC grain. The two co-current pulsed columns design studied are the discs and doughnuts pulsed column and the COBR (continuous oscillatory baffled reactor, Nitech). For the first one, the effect of the packing materials (type and height), of the physico-chemical parameters (dispersed phase concentration, surfactant) and of hydrodynamic parameters (flowrate and oscillation conditions) on the droplet size are investigated where as for the second one the study is limited to the hydrodynamic parameters. A mean droplet size correlation is proposed based on the characteristic dimensionless numbers. The three continuous contactors used for liquid-liquid dispersion are compared in term of energy dissipation rate. The reaction is carried out in a continuous tubular reactor (the pulsed column). The column is suitable to transport solid-liquid suspension. Vinyl acetate suspension polymerization is performed to demonstrate the feasibility and particularly to study the encrusting and fouling problem. The first results are very promising...|$|E

Taking into account damage in constitutive behaviour of metallic materials is necessary to model various engineering problems involved in forming processes (stamping, punching, shearing [...] .). It would lead to accurate predictions introducing microstructural features of materials [1 - 2]. In the present study, two crystalline plasticity models including damage effects in the framework of scale transition methods are investigated. These models are developed and based on different approaches with direct application to duplex stainless steels. The first approach is a variant of the Berveiller-Zaoui model in which the effect of ductile damage has been introduced. The second one is a generalized Cailletaud model taking into account the ductile damage [3 - 6]. Because of the microstructural complexity of the chosen materials, some particular developments of the micromechanical approaches are considered. Moreover, continuous damage mechanics is used at grain scale including its effect (or coupling) on plastic or elastic-plastic flow with more or less complex hardenings. The modelling is justified on some previous experimental results in metallic duplex materials [7 - 8]. The developed models allow then deducing the macroscopic behaviour of the aggregate with damage effects from the <b>grains</b> <b>behaviour...</b>|$|R

Government programmes concerned with family food security require an understanding of o who is most vulnerable to inadequate food intake, o strategies used by households to secure access to food, o how do the poor change food consumption patterns when circumstances change, o {{to what extent is}} on-farm food production shortfall the problem, o the role of other farm and nonfarm activities in household food security, and o programme interventions that will raise food intake. To address these issues requires data on food consumption patterns, household level food availability, and nutritional status of individuals within the household. Since the primary variable to improve household nutritional status is access to food resources, this paper looks primarily at data relating to household food availability and consumption. Basic food grains supply the bulk of calories of most rural households, so the analysis focuses on food grains.
