25|$|The {{paradox of}} the early Bauhaus was that, {{although}} its manifesto proclaimed that the aim of all creative activity was building, the school did not offer classes in architecture until 1927. During the years under Gropius (1919–1927), <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner</b> Adolf Meyer observed no real distinction between the output of his architectural office and the school. So the built output of Bauhaus architecture in these years is the output of Gropius: the Sommerfeld house in Berlin, the Otte house in Berlin, the Auerbach house in Jena, and the competition design for the Chicago Tribune Tower, which brought the school much attention. The definitive 1926 Bauhaus building in Dessau is also attributed to Gropius. Apart from contributions to the 1923 Haus am Horn, student architectural work amounted to un-built projects, interior finishes, and craft work like cabinets, chairs and pottery.|$|E
500|$|Mountfort's {{skill as}} an {{architect}} lay in adapting these flamboyant styles to suit the limited materials available in New Zealand. While wooden churches are plentiful {{in certain parts of}} the US, they are generally of a simple classic design, whereas Mountfort's wooden churches in New Zealand are as much ornate Gothic fantasies as those he designed in stone. Perhaps the flamboyance of his work can be explained in a statement of principles <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner</b> Luck wrote when bidding to win the commission to design Government House, Auckland in 1857: ...|$|E
500|$|As On a Friday {{continued}} {{to perform in}} Oxford, including more performances at the Jericho Tavern, record labels and producers became interested.

Impressed, <b>he</b> <b>and</b> <b>his</b> <b>partner</b> Bryce Edge produced a demo tape and became On a Friday's managers; they remain Radiohead's managers today. In late 1991, after a chance meeting between Colin and EMI A representative Keith Wozencroft at Our Price, the record shop where Colin worked, On a Friday band signed a six-album recording contract with EMI. At the label's request, the band changed their name; [...] "Radiohead" [...] {{was taken from the}} song [...] "Radio Head" [...] on the Talking Heads album True Stories (1986).|$|E
