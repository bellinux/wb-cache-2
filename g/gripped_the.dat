5|$|Anti-Communist {{sentiment}} <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> United States {{during the}} Cold War beginning in 1946. Federal investigations caused many persons with Communist or left-leaning affiliations {{to lose their}} jobs, become blacklisted, or be jailed. During the Cold War, although the United States collectively ignored {{the civil rights of}} Communists, other civil liberties—such as due process in law and separation of church and state—continued to be reinforced and even expanded.|$|E
5|$|Following the Egyptian mania that <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> {{country after}} the {{discovery}} of King Tut's tomb in 1922, Harvey's Pyramid project sparked {{a lot of interest}} and was widely reported throughout the U.S. Tens of thousands of people came to Monte Ne during the 1920s to see its progress. Harvey continued to raise funds from events held at the amphitheater, such as conventions.|$|E
5|$|Barnes <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> bat {{very low}} on the handle and bent over so far in his stance that the {{knuckles}} {{of his right hand}} were level with his knees. He stood with his heels almost together and the toes of his left foot pointing toward extra cover, which left him open-chested when facing the bowler. A noticeable flourish in his backlift enabled him to follow the swinging delivery and play it late if necessary. His first movement was back and across the crease to cover the stumps from the view of the bowler, putting him in position to play the hook, leg glance, sweep and his favourite square cut shot.|$|E
50|$|There are 2 {{types of}} grips used. In Under <b>Grip,</b> <b>the</b> rod is <b>gripped</b> firmly with <b>the</b> {{back of the}} hands turned towards the body. In Top <b>Grip,</b> <b>the</b> rod is <b>gripped</b> with <b>the</b> {{knuckles}} turned outwards.|$|R

5|$|Carroll's tenure {{was plagued}} by disasters, both natural and man-made. Flooding struck {{in the eastern part}} of the state and in the state capitol of Frankfort. Extreme cold <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> entire state in 1977 and 1978, {{including}} the Great Blizzard of 1978. Two mine explosions in Letcher County killed 26 people, and the Beverly Hills Supper Club fire claimed 165 lives. Many of these disasters led to stricter enforcement of safety laws. Carroll formed the Department of Housing, Buildings, and Construction and strengthened the state fire marshal's office.|$|E
5|$|Following the {{collapse}} of the Whig Party in the early 1850s, many former Whigs joined the Know Nothing, or American, Party, and Charles S. Morehead was elected governor from that party in 1855. Sectarian tensions <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> state in the lead-up to the Civil War, and while the majority of Kentuckians favored the preservation of the Union above all else, a self-constituted group of Confederate sympathizers met at Russellville and formed a Confederate government for the state. While this provisional government never displaced the elected government in Frankfort, two men served as Confederate governors of Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|In 1919, {{after the}} end of the war, Justice participated in the French naval {{intervention}} in the Russian Civil War in the Black Sea, and was based in Sevastopol. On 19 April, a mutiny <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> French fleet, starting on the battleship France, the squadron flagship. At one point during the mutiny, the crew of Justice briefly flew the red flag, though they remained relatively calm. The situation worsened after a group of Greek soldiers fired into a crowd of demonstrators ashore; one French sailor was killed and another five were injured. Justices crew was enraged, and began discussing opening fire on the Greek battleship Kilkis, moored nearby. Justices captain ordered his ship's guns disabled by removing their breech blocks to prevent an attack. The situation was eventually defused by returning the French squadron back to France, one of the mutineers' primary demands. Ultimately, Justice was stricken from the naval register in 1922 and sold for scrap.|$|E

5|$|In 1948, Shostakovich {{acquired}} {{a book of}} Jewish folk songs, and from this he composed the song cycle From Jewish Folk Poetry. He initially wrote eight songs that were meant to represent the hardships of being Jewish in the Soviet Union. However in order to disguise this, Shostakovich ended up adding three more songs meant to demonstrate the great life Jews had under the Soviet regime. Despite his efforts to hide the real meaning in the work, the Union of Composers refused to approve his music in 1949 {{under the pressure of}} the anti-Semitism that <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> country. From Jewish Folk Poetry could not be performed until after Stalin’s death in March 1953, along with all the other works that were forbidden.|$|E
5|$|In {{the late}} 1960s and early 1970s, {{financial}} crisis <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> New York City {{government and the}} troubles spread to the city's institutions, including NYU. Feeling the pressures of imminent bankruptcy, NYU President James McNaughton Hester negotiated {{the sale of the}} University Heights campus to the City University of New York, which occurred in 1973. In 1973, the New York University School of Engineering and Science merged into Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, which eventually merged into NYU in 2014 forming the present Tandon School of Engineering. After the sale of the Bronx campus, University College merged with Washington Square College. In the 1980s, under the leadership of President John Brademas, NYU launched a billion-dollar campaign that was spent almost entirely on updating facilities. The campaign was set to complete in 15 years, but ended up being completed in 10. In 2003 President John Sexton launched a $2.5 billion campaign for funds to be spent especially on faculty and financial aid resources.|$|E
5|$|In {{the summer}} of 1956 the town came to {{national}} and worldwide attention, when Dr John Bodkin Adams, a general practitioner serving the town's wealthier patients, was arrested {{for the murder of}} an elderly widow. Rumours had been circulating since 1935 regarding the frequency of his being named in patients' wills (132 times between 1946 and 1956) and the gifts he was given (including two Rolls Royces). Figures of up to 400 murders were reported in British and foreign newspapers, but after a controversial trial at the Old Bailey which <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> nation for 17 days in March 1957, Adams was found not guilty. He was struck off for four years but resumed his practice in Eastbourne in 1961. According to Scotland Yard's archives, he is thought to have killed up to 163 patients in the Eastbourne area.|$|E

The bent tweezer is cheaper to manufacture, but gives weaker <b>grip.</b> <b>The</b> fused tweezer is more expensive, but allows for a stronger <b>grip.</b> <b>The</b> width between {{the tips of the}} tweezers when no force is applied also affects how powerful <b>the</b> <b>grip</b> is.|$|R
5|$|The most {{significant}} Civil War battle fought in Indiana {{was a small}} skirmish during Morgan's Raid. On the morning of July 9, 1863, Morgan attempted to cross the Ohio River into Indiana with his force of 2,400 Confederate cavalry. After his crossing was briefly contested, he marched north to Corydon where he fought the Indiana Legion in the short Battle of Corydon. Morgan took command of the heights south of Corydon and shot two shells from his batteries into the town, which promptly surrendered. The battle left 15 dead and 40 wounded. Morgan's main body of troopers briefly raided New Salisbury, Crandall, Palmyra, and Salem. Fear <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> capitol, and the militia began to form there to contest Morgan's advance. After Salem, however, Morgan turned east, raiding and skirmishing along this path and leaving Indiana through West Harrison on July 13 into Ohio, where he was captured.|$|E
5|$|A major crisis <b>gripped</b> <b>the</b> ACLU in 1968 when {{a debate}} erupted {{over whether to}} defend Benjamin Spock and the Boston Five against federal charges that they {{encouraged}} draftees to avoid the draft. The ACLU board was deeply split over whether to defend the activists; half the board harbored anti-war sentiments, and felt that the ACLU should lend its resources {{to the cause of}} the Boston Five. The other half of the board believed that civil liberties were not at stake, and the ACLU would be taking a political stance. Behind the debate was the longstanding ACLU tradition that it was politically impartial, and provided legal advice without regard to the political views of the defendants. The board finally agreed to a compromise solution that permitted the ACLU to defend the anti-war activists, without endorsing the activist's political views. Some critics of the ACLU suggest that the ACLU became a partisan political organization following the Spock case. After the Kent State shootings in 1970, ACLU leaders took another step towards politics by passing a resolution condemning the Vietnam War. The resolution was based in a variety of legal arguments, including civil liberties violations and a claim that the war was illegal.|$|E
