40|$|U. S. Department of Energy (DOE) used large {{quantities}} of mercury in the uranium separating process from the 1950 s until the late 1980 s in support of national defense. Some of this mercury, {{as well as other}} hazardous metals and radionuclides, found its way into, and under, several buildings, soil and subsurface soils and into some of the surface waters. Several of these areas may pose potential health or environmental risks and must be dealt with under current environmental regulations. DOE's National Energy Technology Laboratory (NETL) awarded a contract ''Alternative Field Methods to Treat Mercury in Soil'' to IT Group, Knoxville TN (IT) and its subcontractor NFS, Erwin, TN to identify remedial methods to clean up mercury-contaminated high-clay content soils using proven treatment chemistries. The sites of interest were the Y- 12 National Security Complex located in Oak Ridge, Tennessee, the David Witherspoon properties located in Knoxville, Tennessee, and at other similarly contaminated sites. The primary laboratory-scale contract objectives were (1) to safely retrieve and test samples of contaminated soil in an approved laboratory and (2) to determine an acceptable treatment method to ensure that the mercury does not leach from the soil above regulatory levels. The leaching requirements were to meet the TC (0. 2 mg/l) and UTS (0. 025 mg/l) TCLP criteria. In-situ treatments were preferred to control potential mercury vapors emissions and liquid mercury spills associated with ex-situ treatments. All laboratory work was conducted in IT's and NFS laboratories. Mercury contaminated nonradioactive soil from under the Alpha 2 building in the Y- 12 complex was used. This soils contained insufficient levels of leachable mercury and resulted in TCLP mercury concentrations that were similar to the applicable LDR limits. The soil was spiked at multiple levels with metallic (up to 6000 mg/l) and soluble mercury compounds (up to 500 mg/kg) to simulate expected ranges of mercury contamination and to increase the TCLP mercury values. IT/NFS investigated ambient temperature amalgamation/stabilization/fixation of mercury-contaminated soils to meet these objectives. Treatment ranged in size from a few ounces to 10 pounds. The treatability study philosophy was to develop working envelops of formulations where reasonable minimum and maximum amounts of each reagent that would successfully treat the contaminated soil were determined. The dosages investigated were based on ratios of stoichiometric reactions and applications of standard sets of formulations. The approach purposely identified formulations that failed short or longer cure-time performance criteria to define the limits of the envelope. Reagent envelops successfully met the project requirements one day after treatment and after greater than 30 -day cures. The use of multiple levels of spikes allowed the establishment of reagent dosages that were successful across a broad range of mercury values, e. g., 50 to 6000 mg/kg mercury. The treatment products were damp to slightly wet material. Enough <b>drying</b> <b>reagent,</b> e. g., Portland cement or lime by-product, were added to some formulations to control the leachability of uranium and other hazardous metals and to ensure the product passed the paint filter test. Cost analyzes and conceptual designs for four alternatives for full-scale treatments were prepared. The alternatives included two in-situ treatments and two ex-situ treatments. The cost estimates were based on the results from the bench-scale study. All four alternatives treatment costs were well below the baseline costs...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: The most {{commonly}} used test for monitoring heparin therapy is the {{activated partial thromboplastin time}} (aPTT). The response of available aPTT reagents to heparin varies significantly. The aim {{of this study was to}} highlight the differences between aPTT reagents stored in a dried format in order to select the most suitable formulations to be used for the development of point of care diagnostic devices used for monitoring of unfractionated heparin dose response. Methods: Ten reagents were analysed in terms of their performance in liquid and in dried form after storage for 24 h and 14 days. Performance was assessed by measurement of the clotting time (CT) as evidenced by the onset of thrombin formation using a chromogenic thrombin substrate in plasma samples activated with these formulations. Results: Reagents in all of the three forms tested (liquid, 24 h and 14 days) resulted in significant shortening of CTs in comparison to the non-activated plasma CT.

40|$|ABSTRACT: We have {{demonstrated}} a multistep 2 -dimensional paper network immunoassay based on controlled rehydration of patterned, <b>dried</b> <b>reagents.</b> Previous work {{has shown that}} signal enhancement improves the limit of detection in 2 -dimensional paper network assays, but until now, reagents have only been included as wet or dried in separate conjugate pads placed at the upstream end of the assay device. Wet reagents are not ideal for point-of-care because they must be refrigerated and typically limit automation and require more user steps. Conjugate pads allow drying but do not offer any control of the reagent distribution upon rehydration and can {{be a source of}} error when pads do not contact the assay membrane uniformly. Furthermore, each <b>reagent</b> is <b>dried</b> on a separate pad, increasing the fabrication complexity when implementing multistep assays that require several different reagents. Conversely, our novel method allows for consistent, controlled rehydration from patterned reagent storage depots directly within the paper membrane. In this assay demonstration, four separate reagents were patterned in different regions of the assay device: a gold-antibody conjugate used for antigen detection and three different signal enhancement components that must not be mixed until immediately before use.

40|$|Aqueous reagent {{solution}} micro-domains {{with sharp}} boundaries and defined shapes are created over cell monolayers within an immiscible bulk aqueous phase through rehydration of freestanding and portable <b>dried</b> <b>reagent</b> patches of the corresponding shape. This {{is in contrast}} to typical dissolution of reagent tablets or lyophilized biopolymer patches in aqueous solutions where no discernible reagent solution patterns are formed upon their full hydration. The key to enable the engineering of such stable reagent solution micro-domains is to formulate the reagent patches with polymers that form an aqueous two-phase system (ATPS) upon hydration by the bulk aqueous phase. This paper demonstrates this concept using <b>dried</b> <b>reagent</b> patches that incorporate dextran (DEX) and a bulk aqueous phase comprised of cell culture medium containing poly(ethylene) glycol (PEG). For reagents that prefer to partition in the DEX phase of the resulting ATPS, this procedure results in micro-patterned localization of reagent solution only to regions of the cell monolayer covered with the rehydrated DEX patch. The types of aqueous reagent solution micro-domain shapes that can be formed by the rehydration of such freestanding DEX-reagent patches are surprisingly broad and can be readily controlled by use of different templates for dehydrating the DEX solutions or even by cutting flat patches. The utility of the method is demonstrated through localized delivery of fluorescent molecules and enzymes for cell detachment.

40|$|Thesis (Master's) [...] University of Washington, 2015 The {{translation}} of sophisticated, laboratory-developed methods for disease diagnosis into devices appropriate for locations with limited infrastructure—whether {{that is a}} military setting, resource-poor country, or a home—requires the development of rapid, inexpensive, robust, and semi-autonomous assays. One common diagnostic testing format that addresses these requirements is the lateral flow test (LFT). These tests use modified porous substrates to automate the delivery of samples via wicking, which enables low-cost and equipment-free analysis. These tests also utilize the rehydration of <b>reagents</b> from <b>dry</b> storage in the substrate, which enables multi-step and intervention-free assays. Typically, <b>dry</b> <b>reagents</b> in LFTs are stored with sugars that preserve reagent functionality. However, the formation of concentrated sugar solutions in porous media during drying can lead to non-uniform rehydration of reagents stored by this method. Additionally, in many diagnostic assays, the uniform mixing of targets with multiple reagents at precise concentrations is critical to performance. This {{is especially true for}} LFT-based isothermal nucleic acid amplification tests (iNAATs), for which the non-uniform rehydration of reagents causes a drastic reduction in assay performance. Since iNAATs produce results more rapidly and with increased sensitivity than traditional culture-based methods, their use in the LFT format represents an ideal diagnostic test for use in low-resource settings (LRS). Therefore, further study and development of iNAAT reagent rehydration in porous media is needed to enable improved LFT-based iNAATs for disease diagnosis in LRS. To this end, we have developed a novel, quantitative, fluorescence-based method for the observation and analysis of isothermal DNA amplification from <b>dry</b> <b>reagents</b> in porous media. Here, we describe this method and accompanying analytical tools to assess variations in reagent composition, imbibition time and target input levels with direct utility for performance quantification of a real LFT-based iNAAT...|$|R

Recently, the term has also been used to describe systems that inject a <b>dry</b> <b>reagent</b> or slurry into a dirty exhaust stream to [...] "wash out" [...] acid gases. Scrubbers are one of the primary devices that control gaseous emissions, especially acid gases. Scrubbers can also be used for heat recovery from hot gases by flue-gas condensation. [...] They are also used for the high flows in solar, PV, or LED processes.|$|R
