25|$|Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat {{had been}} living in exile with the {{prospect}} of his clan and lands being taken over by a Mackenzie who was married to Lady Amelia Fraser of Lovat, daughter of the 9th Lord Lovat and second cousin of Simon. Upon the outbreak of the Jacobite rising of 1715, Simon Fraser, 11th Lord Lovat returned to Scotland and despite being a staunch Jacobite offered his services to John Campbell, 2nd Duke of Argyll who was in overall command of British forces in Scotland in order to restore himself in Scotland. This would be a severe blow to the Jacobites and so Argyll <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a chance.|$|E
500|$|During February and March, Yagan was {{involved}} in a series of minor conflicts with settlers. In February William Watson complained that Yagan had pushed open his door, demanded a gun, and taken handkerchiefs. Watson <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> and his companions flour and bread. The following month, Yagan was among a group who received biscuits from a military contingent under Lieutenant Norcott; when Norcott tried to restrict his supply, Yagan threatened him with his spear. Later that month, Yagan was with a group of Noongar who entered Watson's house while he was away. The group left after Watson's wife called on neighbours for help. The next day Captain Ellis lectured the Noongar about their behaviour. The frequent incidents prompted The Perth Gazette to remark on [...] "the reckless daring of this desperado who sets his life at a pin's fee... For the most trivial offence ... he would take the life of any man who provoked him. He is at the head and front of any mischief." ...|$|E
500|$|... "Trevor" [...] was co-written by Ken Hawryliw and Jim Guttridge. Hawryliw {{had been}} The X-Files {{property}} master from 1993 to 1998 while {{the show was}} filmed in Vancouver, British Columbia. Over the years, he had written several scripts but had never submitted them to The X-Files writing staff. Eventually, {{he moved on to}} work on Millennium, where he developed a friendship with Guttridge. Guttridge showed Hawryliw a script he had been writing that he wanted to submit for The X-Files. Although the story was not written like an X-Files script, Hawryliw enjoyed the premise. The two decided to form a partnership: Guttridge would craft the basic story and script and Hawryliw would help to craft it into an X-Files script. Hawryliw later explained that the idea to make Pinker search out his son: [...] "There's this unique man who can walk through walls. Now, who would this ability best apply to? Well, a convict obviously—a guy in prison. But then we <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an even stronger, more compelling reason to want his freedom, and that was where his son came from".|$|E

6000|$|... "I {{never liked}} {{him from the}} start," [...] {{answered}} Larry, frankly. [...] "But you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> credit for being a good all-round sailor." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Then, upon my word, I think you'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the ten {{thousand}} pounds. I don't even know {{but what the}} demand is moderate." ...|$|R
2500|$|The {{character}} was originally named Jimmy McArdle but {{because no one}} liked the name, executive producer Robert F. Colesberry suggested renaming him Jimmy McNulty (after his maternal grandmother). The McArdle surname would be reused for the character of [...] "White Mike" [...] McArdle in season 2. Dominic West's original audition tape for the part was recorded with him as the sole actor leaving spaces for the lines that would be spoken back to him. The producers were amused by the tape and agreed that they <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an audition.|$|E
2500|$|In the Fifth Test Max O'Connell called [...] "over" [...] {{and turned}} to walk to square leg after Snow bowled the last ball of the first over. As a result he missed Alan Knott {{catching}} Keith Stackpole and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> not out. This was his first over as an umpire in Test cricket and Snow 'could quite understand his actions which illustrate the pressure umpires are also under in a Test', {{and they were able}} to joke about it afterwards. In the Seventh Test Walters had to be stumped twice by Knott off Underwood as he was given not out by Rowan the first time when for 41, but was a few balls later by Max O'Connell on 42. Later in the match Keith Stackpole was caught off a thick edge by Alan Knott off Peter Lever on 13, but was given not out by Rowan, Illingworth said the decision [...] "was really unbelievable".|$|E
2500|$|Hurst was an {{athletic}} {{man in the}} outfield who bowled with an elaborate, [...] "winding" [...] delivery stride that generated real pace. He was a terrible batsman, scoring 10 ducks in 20 Test innings. In the 1978-79 Ashes series, he set a record by scoring two pairs. The only truly controversial incident of his career happened in the 1979 Perth test when Alan Hurst ran out Pakistan’s number eleven batsman Sikander Bakht at the bowler's end as Bakht was backing up too far - the fourth such instance in Test cricket. Later in the day, Australian batsman Andrew Hilditch was given out after an appeal for handled the ball and became the only non-striker to have suffered that decision. Hilditch picked up a wayward throw that had dribbled onto the pitch and handed the ball back to Sarfraz Nawaz who appealed and the umpire <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> out. This incident was in retaliation for Hurst’s actions. The brief series {{was one of the}} most bad-tempered in history, caused in part by Pakistan’s decision to play their WSC-contracted men.|$|E
6000|$|... "In Beverly Square. I say, mother, if {{that there}} grocer don't send us better stuff than this here bacon in future, I'll--I'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> up." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{am quite}} sure she will," [...] said Silverbridge, whose ideas as to Isabel's duties were {{confined}} at present to {{a feeling that}} she would now <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> kisses without stint.|$|R
6000|$|... "It's {{a little}} too bad of Weston. I shouldn't have waited for anybody else," [...] he said. [...] "As it is, I suppose we'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{a minute or two}} longer." ...|$|R
2500|$|Much as Dmitry disliked his tight upper-lipped, stone-faced dad, {{later he}} <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> credit {{for being the}} first one to have noticed and, in his emotionless way, {{appreciate}} his first poetic exercises. In July 1879, in Alupka, Crimea, Sergey Ivanovich introduced Dmitry to the legendary Princess Yekaterina [...] Vorontzova, once Pushkin's sweetheart. The grand dame admired the boy's verses: she (according to a biographer) [...] "spotted in them a must-have poetic quality: the metaphysical sensitivity of a young soul" [...] and encouraged him to soldier on. Somewhat different was young Merezhkovsky's encounter with another luminary, Fyodor Dostoyevsky, staged by his well-connected father again. As the boy started reciting his work, nervous to the point of stuttering, the famous novelist listened rather impatiently, then said: [...] "Poor, very poor. To write well, one has to suffer. Suffer!" [...] – [...] "Oh no, I'd rather he won't – either suffer, or write well!", the appalled father exclaimed. The boy left Dostoyevsky's house much frustrated by the great man's verdict. Merezhkovsky's debut publication followed the same year: Saint Petersburg magazine Zhivopisnoye Obozrenye published two of his poems, [...] "Little Cloud" [...] and [...] "The Autumn Melody". A year later another poem [...] "Narcissus" [...] was included in a charity compilation benefiting destitute students, edited by Pyotr Yakubovich.|$|E
2500|$|In the Fifth Test Max O'Connell {{made the}} worst {{decision}} in the series when he called [...] "over" [...] and turned to walk to square leg after Snow bowled the last ball of the first over. As a result, he missed Alan Knott catching Keith Stackpole and <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> not out. This was his first over in Test cricket and Snow [...] "could quite understand his actions which illustrate the pressure umpires are also under in a Test", {{and they were able}} to joke about it afterwards. Snow had more problems with Lou Rowan, a policeman who was inclined to stand on his authority and retired at the end of the series. In 1972 he wrote The Umpire's Story which was highly critical of the England team, particularly of Illingworth and Snow. It even queried [...] "was John Snow actually grabbed by a spectator who objected to Snow flattening an Australian batsman?" [...] regardless of photographic evidence to the contrary. In return Snow devoted a whole chapter to [...] "Bitter Rows with Umpire Rowan" [...] in his autobiography Cricket Rebel. Rowan in particular warned Snow for his short-pitched bowling and Snow thought this was partisanship as Alan Thomson was not called to book when he bowled bouncers at Snow and six in one eight-ball over against Ray Illingworth. Snow was twice warned by Rowan for intimidatory bowling in the Second Test at Perth, but refused to accept that rib-high balls were intimidatory and continued to bowl them. As a result, Snow was given an official warning, which meant that he would not be allowed to bowl if he was warned again. Illingworth told him that this was to be his last over in any case and the fast bowler sent his last ball flying over the head of Doug Walters, turned to Rowan and said [...] "Now that's a bouncer for you".|$|E

6000|$|... "I'd be awful sorry {{myself if}} Pat died. But if he DID, we'd <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{the right kind}} of a funeral," [...] he protested. [...] "Why, Paddy just seems like one of the family." ...|$|R
50|$|Graf Yoster {{was very}} much an amateur detective in the {{tradition}} of Dorothy Sayer's Lord Peter Wimsey. His cases were accordingly whodunits although in the end Ioan would frequently <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a hand disarming the detected offenders.|$|R
6000|$|... "I hope Dr. Breen's new {{patient will}} be more tractable," [...] said Mrs. Merritt. [...] "It would be a pity if she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> up, too, to Dr. Mulbridge." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Young Menzies bagged {{it after}} the match yesterday. His brother came down with the Oxford A team, and he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> tea in his study. Then there were some biscuits--" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Me too," [...] said Edwin, as they lighted their cigarettes. [...] "In fact, I wouldn't {{buy them}} now if it weren't for Dad. I simply <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{something}} from Santa Claus. He believes in Santa Claus absolutely, you know." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Well, {{you will}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> up,' said the Marchioness calmly. 'It {{shall not be}} the worse for you--you may see him when you choose. I am going to avow my first marriage, and have him with me.' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{remember}} you, Master Matteo," [...] Pisani said, as {{he shook}} {{him by the}} hand. [...] "I have seen you often at your father's house. I shall <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a good account of you, for I saw you fighting bravely.|$|R
6000|$|... "Then {{wait till}} he sends for his son's remains. If you do that, {{you will never}} <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> the last and sharpest pain a parent can know-- I mean, the {{certainty}} that his son is dead. For he will never send." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "We <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{a little}} rope {{to go through}} with his act," [...] he whispered confidentially. [...] "But he'll sign it all right. And now, if you'll excuse me, Mr. Paret, I'll lay a few mines. See you at the hotel, sir." ...|$|E
60|$|PYGMALION. Not he. He {{was a most}} {{dangerous}} beast. He was afraid of me, and actually {{tried to kill me}} by snatching up things and striking at me with them. I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> two or three pretty severe shocks before I convinced him that he was at my mercy.|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{think he}} must die for want o' support, {{if he goes}} on in that way. When I nursed my poor master, Mr. Robisson, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> port-wine and brandy constant, and a big glass at a time," [...] added Mrs. Abel, {{with a touch of}} remonstrance in her tone.|$|E
6000|$|... “No—in {{that case}} I should <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> an order, and I don’t know {{what in the}} world to ask him to do. He sits there for hours; with my simple habits I afford him no employment. I’m afraid I’ve no grand imagination.” ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes,--yes; I've {{heard of}} him before. If Tappitt doesn't take him into the concern he'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a very serious bit of money.

60|$|Yet {{with it all}} {{the time}} passed slowly, and both Andy and Chet were anxious for the Long Night to come to an end. The {{darkness}} was beginning to tell on many of the party, and Pep Loggermore especially began to act strangely. Once he began to sing hysterically, and the doctor <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> some medicine to quiet him.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ay, slowly, but I'd {{get on a}} deal faster if that lazy brown-skin Ohoo {{would work}} harder. Just look at him.

I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a taste of a rope's end this morning, but it don't seem to have done him much good." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Oh, I <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> {{some kind}} of reason for my being alone when I did not find you as I expected," [...] she said half wearily. Then a change came over her tired face; a smile of mingled audacity and {{tentative}} coquetry lit up the small features. [...] "Perhaps it is true; perhaps I may have a husband coming on the steamer--that depends. Sit down, Jim." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "No, poor devil! I am {{inclined}} {{to think that he}} has got as bad as he deserves. He might have been so much worse. We owe him ever so much for not destroying the will.

6000|$|... "You'll <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>give</b> <b>him</b> a good lump o' tobacco to do it, though; he won't {{undertake}} so {{much for}} a trifle, I can tell you."
