Multivariate analyses separate foraminiferal assemblages into two faunal zones: a high- and middle marsh zone consisting of differing abundances of Jadammina macrescens, Trochammina inflata and Miliammina fusca; and a low-marsh and tidal flat zone dominated by calcareous foraminiferal species, notably Elphidium williamsoni, Haynesina germanica and Quinqueloculina spp. These <b>faunal</b> <b>zones</b> {{are similar to those}} in other mid-latitude, cool temperate intertidal environments although there are spatial and temporal variations between areas.

Lake Ohrid is also noted in zoology texts for the European eel and its baffling reproductive cycle: it comes to Lake Ohrid from the distant Sargasso Sea, thousands of kilometres away, and lurks in the depths of the lake for 10 years. When sexually mature, the eel is driven by unexplained instincts in the autumn to set off back to its point of birth. There it spawns and dies, leaving its offspring to seek out Lake Ohrid to begin the cycle anew.|$|E
40|$|Neohelos is a {{geographically}} and temporally widespread genus of Cenozoic diprotodontid marsupials {{commonly used}} to biocorrelate otherwise undated Australian fossil deposits. Here we revise the genus and describe two new species from the Riversleigh World Heritage Area, northwestern Queensland. Neohelos solus n. sp. is a small, relatively abundant, plesiomorphic form, while the rarer, larger Neohelos davidridei n. sp. is the most derived species of the genus with an upper premolar morphology that is structurally antecedant {{to members of the}} late Miocene genus Kolopsis. Additional material of Neohelos tirarensis and Ne. stirtoni is described. A chronological morphocline is evidenced by a gradual change in morphology accompanied by an increase in size from Ne. tirarensis through Ne. stirtoni to Ne. davidridei, and is generally consistent with the biostratigraphic distribution of Neohelos species throughout Riversleigh’s Faunal Zones A to D. Stage of evolution biocorrelation of Neohelos species confirms that some of Riversleigh's <b>Faunal</b> <b>Zone</b> A deposits are late Oligocene in age and predate the Wipajiri Formation of South Australia.

40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 1978 The {{overall view}} {{presented}} by {{this study is}} of closely interrelated Bering/Chukchi benthic community system that extends unbroken over the entire continental shelf, with the Chukchi Sea benthos probably relying heavily on the Bering Sea for both food supply and possibly recruitment. Indications are {{that this is a}} highly productive and relatively stable benthic system comprised of at least eight major <b>faunal</b> <b>zones</b> of considerable complexity. The environmental factor correlating most strongly with the distribution of these <b>faunal</b> <b>zones</b> and with distribution of individual major species appears to be sediment type, though summer bottom temperature may also be critical. The distribution of standing stock biomass in relation to diversity suggests predation pressure on the southern and northern extremes of the study area, presumably the result of benthic-feeding marine mammal populations and possibly, {{in the case of the}} southern region, demersal fish. In general terms it appears to be a strongly detrital-based trophic system, with an elevated standing stock biomass observed in the Bering Strait and southern Chukchi Sea region, probably the combined result of high near-surface primary productivity distributions and current structure. The benthic fauna over this region appears to be dominated by boreal Pacific forms, probably also a result of the current structure, with high Arctic forms frequent only in the northern waters...|$|R

40|$|A {{terminology}} {{is introduced}} {{that can be}} used for describing as well as theorizing and is thus useful for hierarchically classifying observations. All known communally breeding species in Australia are tabulated: sixty-five in twenty families. Evidence is presented for species being described as communal breeders for the first time and for species in which additional data have become available since the last major review (Rowley 1976). Published maps of the ranges of thirty-ope species were coded digitally by degree-block for analysis by computer as were maps of vegetation, <b>faunal</b> <b>zones</b> and eleven environmental variables. The distribution of these species is tabulated by the vegetational and <b>faunal</b> <b>zones</b> that they occupy and a detailed statistical tabulation is included of all the environmental variables for each species separately. A composite map shows the density of species throughout Australia. The greatest number (24) of communally breeding species was found in northern New South Wales. The pattern of distribution did not merely reflect that of land birds in general and numbers of species were not strongly associated with particular <b>faunal</b> <b>zones</b> or vegetational types. A regression model was constructed that accounted for seventy-eight per cent of the variation in numbers of species by simple geographical variables, longitude being the most important. Two analytical strategies were used. The first suggested that the most important environmental variables were moisture in the driest sixteen-week period, temperature in the coldest week, and moisture in winter; the second, plant growth in summer, temperature in the coldest week, variation in rainfall and seasonal variation in plant growth. The possible relations between these variables and communally breeding species are discussed and it is concluded that the enviromental data neither strongly favour nor exclude three hypotheses regarding the origin or adaptive maintenance of communal breeding generally. The analysis does not support the view that because taxonomic diversity of communally breeding species is high, there must be common factors in their ecology. Species are considered to be opportunistic communal breeders or obligate communal breeders and a simple model incorporating physiological condition, social attraction and group facilitation illustrates the concept of ‘levels’ of communal breeding that have been observed in nature. The distinction between opportunistic and obligate species is considered important because these may represent different evolutionary strategies for behaviour hitherto lumped as communal breeding...|$|R

40|$|The {{application}} of salt-marsh foraminifera to reconstruct historical sea-level trends was investigated for the Croatian {{coast of the}} Adriatic Sea using a transfer function approach. This technique, whilst well practised from north Atlantic sites along the shores of America and UK, has previously evaded any published study in the Mediterranean region. A total of 70 surface samples were collected across separate transects established at two micro-tidal salt-marsh sites from the central Croatian coastline to establish a modern dataset of foraminifera. In addition, environmental variables were also investigated including salinity, pH, organic matter, particle size, distance (from open water) and altitude, relative to the Croatian national datum. Three sediment cores were sampled for fossil foraminifera and composite chronologies involving short-lived radionuclides, radiocarbon dating and pollution indicators from XRF. Age-depth models were created using classical and Bayesian approaches. Quantitative analysis of the foraminiferal assemblages revealed on average three faunal zones in which characteristic species occurred. This comprised a <b>faunal</b> <b>zone</b> composed almost exclusively of agglutinated species; J. macrescens, T. inflata and M. fusca extending between mean tidal level (MTL) and beyond MHWST (higher altitude). A second <b>faunal</b> <b>zone</b> was more variable and comprised of a mixed assemblage of agglutinated species described above in addition to calcareous species; Ammonia spp., Elphidium spp., Haynesina germanica and Quinqueloculina spp. This zone spanned a large vertical range above and below MTL. In a third <b>faunal</b> <b>zone</b> calcareous species dominated and was restricted to the lower altitudes of the salt-marsh environments. Further quantitative measures were employed {{to test the hypothesis}} that foraminiferal distributions were controlled by altitude. Partial ordination techniques revealed altitude as a statistically significant control confirming their suitability as proxies for sea-level in transfer function reconstructions. An analysis of species environment relationships revealed strong linear response suggesting the use of PLS regression models.

40|$|While centrosaurines and ceratopsids {{in general}} are {{abundant}} in the Late Campanian of northern Laramidia, they are much less commonly found in southern Laramidia.

There have been 12 genera of centrosaurines recognized from northern Laramidia while two genera, Diabloceratops and Nasutoceratops, have been named from southern Laramidia.

The abundant presence of planktonic foraminifera in {{the lower part of}} the Tiyon formation indicates the connection of depositional basin with the open sea, while this condition does not exist in the upper part of the formation. The Tiyon formation contains a variety of stratigraphically important benthic and planktonic species which includes 140 species, 35 planktonic and 120 benthonic forams, belonging to 31 genera & 15 families. The recognized planktonic zonation includes Globigerinatheka semiinvolta Zone, Truncorotaloides rohri Zone, Orbulinoid beckmanni Zone, Globigerina frontosa Zone, Hantkenina aragonensis Zone and Acarinina pentacamerata Zone. These zones verify the Late Ypresian to Early Bartonian age to the Tiyon formation rather than Late Ypresian to Lutetian.

40|$|The {{marsupial}} family Pseudocheiridae {{is currently}} known from seventeen species of six genera in Australia and New Guinea. These small to medium-sized arboreal animals are nocturnal and folivorous. Extinct pseudocheirids are recognised from several {{mid to late}} Cenozoic fossil localities across Australia and New Guinea. The single largest collection of pseudocheirid fossils has been recovered from the Oligo-Miocene freshwater carbonates of the Riversleigh World Heritage Area in northwest Queensland. This collection, which includes the first pseudocheirid cranial fossils, forms {{the basis of this}} investigation. Three new extinct pseudocheirid genera together containing four species are identified and described. Six new species of Paljara, Marlu and Pildra are also described from Riversleigh. Two of the new Marlu species are reported from South Australia&# 146;s Leaf Locality. From Riversleigh, Marlu kutjamarpensis is identified and additional material of Paljara tirarensae and P. nancyhawardae documented. New species attributed to Marlu and Pildra necessitate revision of those genera. Cranial material is identified for three of the new species. The rostrum of archaic pseudocheirids is shorter than in extant forms but cranial morphology is similar overall. Phylogenetic relationships of all extinct pseudocheirids are analysed. They include all new and previously described species, most of which have never been examined in a parsimony-based analysis. Two hypotheses of pseudocheirid evolution are presented: a paired lineage hypothesis and a single lineage hypothesis. Both hypotheses demonstrate that species of Paljara are not the most plesiomorphic pseudocheirids, Marlu praecursor does not cluster with other species of Marlu, the new genus Gawinga is most closely related to Paljara and there are no representatives of the extant genus Pseudochirops in any pre-Pliocene locality. All extant pseudocheirids cluster to form a crown clade sister to a stem lineage of Pseudokoala and Marlu species. Pseudocheirids are found in all Oligo-Miocene faunal zones of Riversleigh. Species of Paljara and Marlu are most frequently recovered from <b>Faunal</b> <b>Zone</b> B and C deposits respectively. Four pseudocheirid species biostratigraphically correlate the Kutjamarpu local fauna of the Leaf Locality with Faunal Zones B and C of Riversleigh, suggesting an early to middle Miocene age for both deposits. Modern pseudocheirids first evolved no later than the late Miocene from a descendant of the Marlu + Pseudokoala lineage when all other Oligo-Miocene pseudocheirids became extinct. At least three pseudocheirid lineages dispersed to New Guinea approximately five million years ago, but ecological barriers probably prevented subsequent migrations between the two landmasses...|$|E
