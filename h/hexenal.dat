The present studies were conducted to examine {{the relationships between the}} dose-responses of trans- 2 -hexenal-induced toxicity, DNA adduct formation, and cell prolifera-tion. Male F 344 rats were exposed by gavage to single doses of up to 500 mg/kg and killed 1, 2, or 4 days after dosing or were exposed to repeat doses of up to 100 mg/kg once daily for 5 days or 5 days per week for 4 weeks and killed 1 day {{after the end of the}} dosing period. Histologically, the primary observations were necroulcerative lesions, inflammation, and hyperplasia in the forestomach and inflammation in the glandular stomach. Hexenal-derived DNA adduct formation and cell proliferation were induced in the forestomach at doses of <b>hexenal</b> that also induced gastric toxicity; DNA adducts were not observed in the glandular stomach. These findings suggest that the toxicity of <b>hexenal</b> was limited to the site of contact (stomach) and that the observed DNA adduct formation and cell proliferation occurred in the setting of severe tissue damage...|$|E
40|$|In this study, we {{investigated}} the prompt release of acetaldehyde and other oxygenated {{volatile organic compounds}} (VOCs) from leaves of Grey poplar [Populus x canescens (Aiton) Smith] following light-dark transitions. Mass scans utilizing the extremely fast and sensitive proton transfer reaction-mass spectrometry technique revealed the following temporal pattern after light-dark transitions: <b>hexenal</b> was emitted first, followed by acetaldehyde and other C 6 -VOCs. Under anoxic conditions, acetaldehyde was the only compound released after switching off the light. This clearly indicated that <b>hexenal</b> and other C 6 -VOCs were released from the lipoxygenase reaction taking place during light-dark transitions under aerobic conditions. Experiments with enzyme inhibitors that artificially increased cytosolic pyruvate demonstrated that the acetaldehyde burst after light-dark transition could not {{be explained by the}} recently suggested pyruvate overflow mechanism. The simulation of light fleck situations in the canopy by exposing leaves to alternating light-dark and dark-light transitions or fast changes from high to low photosynthetic photon flux density showed that this process is of minor importance for acetaldehyde emission into the Earth's atmosphere...|$|E

40|$|Damage {{to plant}} leaves by {{wounding}} or freezing induces {{the production of}} large amounts of C 6 -compounds. However, the control of formation of these compounds in leaves is not yet clear. In the current study, C 6 -aldehyde formation by freeze-injured soybean leaves of different ages (based on the leaf positions on the plant) at stage R 1 of plant development was investigated. The results demonstrate that C 6 -aldehyde formation by the soybean (Glycine max L.) leaves changes as leaves develop. Younger leaves produce high levels of C 6 -aldehydes, mainly composed of hexanal. Subsequently, as the leaves develop, the level of C 6 -aldehyde formation decreases markedly, followed by an increase with a large shift from hexanal to <b>hexenals.</b> Lipoxygenase and lipolytic acyl hydrolase activity was reduced, and, in contrast, hydroperoxide lyase activity increased. There was little difference in lipoxygenase substrate specificity for linoleic acid and linolenic acid, but hydroperoxide lyase preferentially utilized 13 -hydroperoxy- 9, 11, 15 -octadecatrienoic acid. In the in vivo lipoxygenase substrate pool, the linoleic acid level declined and the relative level of linolenic acid increased.

40|$|There is {{interest}} in and significant uncertainty about the emissions of oxygenated volatile organic compounds (ox VOCs) from vegetation to the atmosphere. Here, we measured the fluxes of selected oxVOCs from an alfalfa field, before, during, and after cutting, {{using a combination of}} disjunct eddy covariance and proton-transfer-reaction mass spectrometry. Over the course of 1 day a significant methanol flux of 4 mg m - 2 h - 1 was observed from undisturbed alfalfa with a maximum at 0800 LT, possibly caused by the evaporation of dew. A smaller release of <b>hexenals</b> during this day (0. 04 mg m - 2 h - 1) demonstrated the sensitivity of the method. Other results suggested that acetaldehyde and acetone were released in the afternoon but were lost by dry deposition in the evening and morning; deposition velocities were estimated to be 0. 2 cm s - 1 (acetaldehyde) and 0. 09 cm s - 1 (acetone). After the alfalfa was cut the emissions of methanol, acetaldehyde, acetone, and <b>hexenals</b> were significantly enhanced and remained high for three days during which the alfalfa was drying. After a rainstorm the oxVOC emissions from the cut, wet alfalfa increased even more. Nighttime measurements yielded low oxVOC fluxes in general, but the high variability of the concentrations during the night and the high degree of correlation between different oxVOCs suggest that the nighttime releases of oxVOCs from alfalfa were nonzero. This work suggests that the global source of oxVOCs due to the production of hay is of minor importance.

Attack by BAW induced release of lipoxygenase products (hexenols, <b>hexenals,</b> and hexenyl esters), terpenoids, and indole. The plant-derived compound methyl salicylate and the fungal-derived compound 3 -octanone were found only in headspace samples from white mold infected plants. White mold-infected plants exposed to BAW damage released all the volatiles emitted by healthy plants fed on by BAW {{in addition to those}} emitted in response to white mold infection alone. When BAW larvae were given a choice of feeding on leaves from healthy or white mold-infected plants, they consumed larger quantities of the leaves from infected plants. Exposure to commercially available (Z) - 3 hexenyl acetate, linalool, and methyl salicylate, compounds emitted by white mold-infected plants, significantly reduced the growth of the white mold in solid-media cultures.

Selected masses detected by the PTR-MS showed fluxes of methanol, acetaldehyde, and acetone. They were highest directly after cutting and during the hay drying phase. Simultaneously, significant fluxes of protonated ion masses 73, 81, and 83 were observed. Due to the limited identification of compounds with the PTR-MS technique, GC-MS and GC-FID-PTR-MS techniques were additionally applied.

Measurements were done over a 3 -day period in a hay field {{in the eastern part of}} Tirol, Austria, in the early growing season and are compared to earlier results obtained using a slower-response instrument in the late growing season [Karl et al., 2000]. Peak upward fluxes of the order of 9. 9 x 10 - 6 g m- 2 s- 1 for methanol, 1. 5 x 10 - 6 g m- 2 s- 1 for acetaldehyde, and 1. 5 x 10 - 6 g m- 2 s- 1 for the sum of <b>hexenals,</b> hexenols, hexanal, pentenols, 3 -methylbutanal, and butanone were observed during and after harvesting. Time-integrated values for the first day were of the order of 65 ± 20 mg m- 2 (130 ± 40 μg per gram dry weight(gdw) - 1) for methanol and 13 ± 4 mg m- 2 (26 ± 8 μg gdw- 1) for acetaldehyde. VOC fluxes measured in this study were generally higher than in August 1999, which can be explained by higher temperatures and higher photosynthetic productivity. Good agreement with another means for estimating VOC fluxes, the surface gradient method, was achieved.

40|$|One of the {{drawbacks}} {{in improving the}} aroma properties of tomato (Solanum lycopersicum) fruit is the complexity of this organoleptic trait, with {{a great variety of}} volatiles contributing to determine specific quality features. It is well established that the oxylipins hexanal and (Z) -hex- 3 -enal, synthesized through the lipoxygenase pathway, are among the most important aroma compounds and impart in a correct proportion some of the unique fresh notes in tomato. Here, we confirm that all enzymes responsible for the synthesis of these C 6 compounds are present and active in tomato fruit. Moreover, due to the low odor threshold of (Z) -hex- 3 -enal, small changes in the concentration of this compound could modify the properties of the tomato fruit aroma. To address this possibility, we have overexpressed the ω- 3 fatty acid desaturases FAD 3 and FAD 7 that catalyze the conversion of linoleic acid (18 : 2) to linolenic acid (18 : 3), the precursor of <b>hexenals</b> and its derived alcohols. Transgenic OE-FAD tomato plants exhibit altered fatty acid composition, with an increase in the 18 : 3 / 18 : 2 ratio in leaves and fruits. These changes provoke a clear variation in the C 6 content that results in a significant alteration of the (Z) -hex- 3 -enal/hexanal ratio that is particularly important in ripe OE-FAD 3 FAD 7 fruits. In addition to this effect on tomato volatile profile, OE-FAD tomato plants are more tolerant to chilling. However, the different behaviors of OE-FAD plants underscore the existence of separate fatty acid fluxes to ensure plant survival under adverse conditions...|$|R

Methanol showed strong daytime emissions throughout the growing season – with maximal values of 9. 7 nmol m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 , methanol fluxes from the growing grassland were considerably higher {{at the beginning of the}} growing season in June compared to those measured during October (2. 5 nmol m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 ). Methanol was the only component that exhibited consistent fluxes during the entire growing periods of the grass. The cutting and drying of the grass increased the emissions of methanol to up to 78. 4 nmol m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 . In addition, emissions of acetaldehyde (up to 11. 0 nmol m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 ), and <b>hexenal</b> (leaf aldehyde, up to 8. 6 nmol m&minus; 2 s&minus; 1 ) were detected during/after harvesting...|$|E
40|$|Lipid {{oxidation}} and myoglobin oxidation in muscle foods {{occur in}} a concurrent manner and each process appears to enhance the other. During oxidation of oxymyoglobin, both superoxide anion and hydrogen peroxide are produced and further react with iron to produce hydroxyl radical. The hydroxyl radical {{has the ability to}} penetrate into the hydrophobic lipid region and hence facilitates lipid oxidation. The prooxidant effect of oxymyoglobin on lipid oxidation is concentrationdependent. At equimolar concentrations, oxymyoglobin shows higher prooxidative activity towards lipid than metmyoglobin. However, the catalytic activity of metmyoglobin is promoted by hydrogen peroxide. The reaction between hydrogen peroxide and metmyoglobin results in the formation of two active hypervalent myoglobin species, perferrylmyoglobin and ferrylmyoglobin, which are responsible for lipid oxidation. Additionally, lipid oxidation results {{in a wide range of}} aldehyde products, which are reported to induce the oxidation of oxymyoglobin. Metmyoglobin formation is generally greater in the presence of unsaturated aldehydes than their saturated counterparts of equivalent carbon chain length. In addition, increasing chain length of aldehydes, from <b>hexenal</b> through nonenal, results in the increased metmyoglobin formation. Moreover, aldehydes alter myoglobin redox stability by increasing oxymyoglobin oxidation, decreasing the metmyoglobin reduction via enzymatic process, and enhance the prooxidant activity of metmyoglobin. Therefore, the oxidation of both lipid and myoglobin directly affect the quality and acceptability of muscle foods and the lowering of such a phenomenon can enhance the shelf-life stability of those foods...|$|E
40|$|Eddy {{covariance}} (EC) is the preferable {{technique for}} flux measurements {{since it is}} the only direct flux determination method. It requires a continuum of high time resolution measurements (e. g. 5 – 20 Hz). For volatile organic compounds (VOC) soft ionization via proton transfer reaction {{has proven to be a}} quantitative method for real time mass spectrometry; here we use a proton transfer reaction time of flight mass spectrometer (PTR-TOF) for 10 Hz EC measurements of full mass spectra up to m/z 315. The mass resolution of the PTR-TOF enabled the identification of chemical formulas and separation of oxygenated and hydrocarbon species exhibiting the same nominal mass. We determined 481 ion mass peaks from ambient air concentration above a managed, temperate mountain grassland in Neustift, Stubai Valley, Austria. During harvesting we found significant fluxes of 18 compounds distributed over 43 ions, including protonated parent compounds, as well as their isotopes and fragments and VOC-H+ – water clusters. The dominant BVOC fluxes were methanol, acetaldehyde, ethanol, <b>hexenal</b> and other C 6 leaf wound compounds, acetone, acetic acid, monoterpenes and sequiterpenes. The smallest reliable fluxes we determined were less than 0. 1 nmol m− 2 s− 1 , as in the case of sesquiterpene emissions from freshly cut grass. Terpenoids, including mono- and sesquiterpenes, were also deposited to the grassland before and after the harvesting. During cutting, total VOC emission fluxes up to 200 nmolC m− 2 s− 1 were measured. Methanol emissions accounted for half of the emissions of oxygenated VOCs and a third of the carbon of all measured VOC emissions during harvesting...|$|E
40|$|There are {{at least}} five lipoxygenases (TomloxA, TomloxB, TomloxC, TomloxD, and TomloxE) present in tomato (Lycopersicon esculentum Mill.) fruit, but their role in {{generation}} of fruit flavor volatiles has been unclear. To assess the physiological role of TomloxC in the generation of volatile C 6 aldehyde and alcohol flavor compounds, we produced transgenic tomato plants with greatly reduced TomloxC using sense and antisense constructs under control of the cauliflower mosaic virus 35 S promoter. The expression level of the TomloxC mRNA in some transgenic plants was selectively reduced by gene silencing or antisense inhibition to between 1 % and 5 % of the wild-type controls, but the expression levels of mRNAs for the four other isoforms were unaffected. The specific depletion of TomloxC in transgenic tomatoes led to a marked reduction in the levels of known flavor volatiles, including hexanal, <b>hexenal,</b> and hexenol, to as little as 1. 5 % of those of wild-type controls following maceration of ripening fruit. Addition of linoleic or linolenic acid to fruit homogenates significantly increased the levels of flavor volatiles, but the increase with the TomloxC-depleted transgenic fruit extracts was much lower than with the wild-type control. Confocal imaging of tobacco (Nicotiana tabacum) leaf cells expressing a TomloxC-GFP fusion confirmed a chloroplast localization of the protein. Together, {{these results suggest that}} TomloxC is a chloroplast-targeted lipoxygenase isoform that can use both linoleic and linolenic acids as substrates to generate volatile C 6 flavor compounds. The roles of the other lipoxygenase isoforms are discussed...|$|E
40|$|Recent {{studies have}} {{proposed}} that n- 3 polyunsaturated fatty acids (n- 3 PUFAs) have direct antioxidant and anti-inflammatory effects in vascular tissue, explaining their cardioprotective effects. However, the molecular mechanisms are not yet fully understood. We tested whether n- 3 PUFAs showed antioxidant activity through the activation of nuclear factor erythroid 2 -related factor 2 (Nrf 2), a master transcriptional factor for antioxidant genes. C 57 BL/ 6 or Nrf 2 (-/-) mice were fed a fish-oil diet for 3 weeks. Fish-oil diet significantly increased the expression of heme oxygenase- 1 (HO- 1), and endothelium-dependent vasodilation in the aorta of C 57 BL/ 6 mice, {{but not in the}} Nrf 2 (-/-) mice. Furthermore, we observed that 4 -hydroxy <b>hexenal</b> (4 -HHE), an end-product of n- 3 PUFA peroxidation, was significantly increased in the aorta of C 57 BL/ 6 mice, accompanied by intra-aortic predominant increase in docosahexaenoic acid (DHA) rather than that in eicosapentaenoic acid (EPA). Human umbilical vein endothelial cells were incubated with DHA or EPA. We found that DHA, but not EPA, markedly increased intracellular 4 -HHE, and nuclear expression and DNA binding of Nrf 2. Both DHA and 4 -HHE also increased the expressions of Nrf 2 target genes including HO- 1, and the siRNA of Nrf 2 abolished these effects. Furthermore, DHA prevented oxidant-induced cellular damage or reactive oxygen species production, and these effects were disappeared by an HO- 1 inhibitor or the siRNA of Nrf 2. Thus, we found protective effects of DHA through Nrf 2 activation in vascular tissue, accompanied by intra-vascular increases in 4 -HHE, which may explain the mechanism of the cardioprotective effects of DHA...|$|E
40|$|The {{pressing}} {{food crisis}} boosts {{the necessity for}} novel strategies to drastically increase crop yields per area of cultivated land. Effective control of insect pests {{should be part of}} such strategies. Our current understanding of plant signaling pathways has interestingly promoted the possibility that manipulating the emission of VOCs using plant elicitors or activators could be an effective tactic for protecting plants against arthropod pests. To test this, we therefore conducted this study in which our aim was to investigate whether treatment of potato, Solanum tuberosum L. with the naturally occurring plant defence activator cis-jasmone (CJ) alters the emission of VOCs, and to determine whether these changes affect the behaviour of potato aphid, Macrosiphum euphorbiae (Thomas) to treated potato plants. In four-arm olfactometer assays, plants that were sprayed with CJ and/or subsequently challenged by M. euphorbiae (ME) became significantly repellent to alate adults of M. euphorbiae than intact plants or solvent control. The chemical profile of induced plants shows that the total emitted volatiles of CJ, ME and CJME treated plants was significantly greater than controls, particularly, after 96 h. Electrophysiological studies reveal that the active VOCs to M. euphorbiae were (E) - 2 <b>hexenal,</b> α-pinene, methyl benzoate (MeBA), nonanal, (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene (DMNT), methyl salicylate (MeSA), CJ, (E) -β-farnesene and (E,E) - 4, 8, 12 -trimethyltrideca- 1, 3, 7, 11 -tetraene (TMTT). Amongst these compounds, DMNT, MeSA, CJ, (E) -β-farnesene and TMTT showed a dramatic consistent increase in their emission over a period of four days. Overall, our findings strengthen the emerging paradigm that induction of plant defence with plant activators such as CJ could provide sustainable and environment-friendly strategy for pest control. status: publishe...|$|E
40|$|In Citrus species {{chromosome}} doubling naturally occurs in somatic embryos and doubled diploid plants often show better adaptation to adverse environmental condition. To understand the molecular determinants of stress acclimation, {{we examined the}} response to water deficit in diploid (2 ×VL) and doubled diploid (4 ×VL) seedlings of Volkamer lemon (Citrus limonia Osb.) assessing the profile of constitutive volatile organic compound (VOC) in control and stressed conditions. Physiological parameters and leaf volatile compound profiles were measured during water deficit and 24 h after rehydration of plants to field capacity. Net photosynthesis and stomatal conductance were reduced in water stressed leaves, with {{no significant differences between}} 2 ×VL and 4 ×VL plants. Malondialdehyde concentration, a marker of lipid peroxidation of cellular membranes, was significantly more higher in stressed 2 ×VL leaves than in 4 ×VL. The blend of constitutive VOC was different in control leaves being oxygenated monoterpenoids more abundant in 2 ×VL leaves, and monoterpenoids more abundant in 4 ×VL leaves. Water deficit did not stimulate biosynthesis of terpenoids, whereas accumulation of trans- 2 <b>hexenal,</b> a green leaf volatile (GLV) synthesized after membrane denaturation, was observed in stressed leaves of 2 ×VL leaves, but not in 4 ×VL leaves. Semiquantitative PCR showed an increase of the expression of HPL, the gene encoding for hydroperoxidase lyase which catalyzes 2 -hexenal formation, only in 2 ×VL plants. The expression of the putative dehydration transcription factor DREB 2 A was also observed only in 2 ×VL water stressed plants. This work shows that level of ploidy may alter constitutive content of GLV by Citrus, therefore likely affecting plants capacity of protection and interaction with other organisms. Whereas diploid and double diploid plants showed similar physiological responses to water deficit, a biochemical marker indicated that membranes of double diploid leaves were more resistant to the stress. These results provide intriguing insights into the regulation of terpenoids and oxylipins pathways as a function of polyploidization in a non-model plant species. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|E
40|$|According to the European Food Safety Agency, human {{dietary intake}} of long chain n- 3 fatty acids (EPA and DHA) {{is lower than}} that {{recommended}} (250 mg/d), so the Food Industry is interested to produce functional foods enriched with these fatty acids (FA). However, enriching food with EPA and DHA may {{increase the risk of}} lipid oxidation and off-flavour development. Microcapsules (MC) obtained by spray-drying may help to avoid this issue, by including fish oil (FO) in a dry powder ready to be integrated into the food. Recently, several dairy products have been proposed as functional foods, by enriching milk with functional lipids or probiotic and pre- biotic substances. The aim of this work was to evaluate the FA and volatile compounds (VOCs) profile and the lipid oxidation of yoghurt enriched with fish oil MC. Four types of MC containing FO were produced using whey protein isolate plus gum arabic (GA) or maltodextrin (MD), with (GAQ; MDQ) or without quercetin as antioxidant. MC were used to obtain four different types of yoghurt that were compared with non-enriched yoghurt (CY) or with yoghurt enriched with unprotected FO (CO), during a 21 days stor- age period at 4 °C. FA composition of yoghurts was determined by gas chromatography (GC) analysis, while the oxidative stability was characterized through the analysis of thiobarbituric acid reac- tive substances (TBARS). Volatile compounds were determined by solid phase microextraction (SPME) coupled with GC/MS. The VOCs composition was evaluated by a multivariate analysis. Yoghurts enriched with 15 g/L of MC resulted in a significant increase of EPA (0. 082 to 2. 012 g/ 100 g total lipids) and DHA (0. 011 to 1. 649 g/ 100 total lipids), irrespective of the presence of quercetin as an antioxidant. At the end of the storage period, the value of TBARS significantly increased only in CO and CY samples, suggest- ing a protective role of MC against FA oxidation. Nevertheless, the MD yoghurt was associated with an oxidative aromatic profile,(2 - <b>hexenal,</b> 2 -methyl furan) whereas the presence of quercetin elim- inated this aspect. GA, GAQ and MDQ yoghurt were associated with an acid flavour profile. CO and CY yoghurts were associated with sweet and fruit flavour profiles (2 -nonanone). In conclusion, MC could be an effective strategy to enrich yoghurt with n- 3 PUFA and simultaneously preserve FO from oxidation, however some differ- ences in the oxidative stability and VOCs profile were observed depending on the properties of the MC wall...|$|E
40|$|PhD (Environmental Sciences), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2015 Maize, {{a genetically}} diverse crop, {{is the third}} largest cereal crop {{in the world and}} the most {{important}} staple cereal in sub-Saharan Africa, supplying 50 % of the calorie intake in this region. The stemborer Chilo partellus (Swinhoe) (Lepidoptera: Crambidae) is a key constraint to cereal production in most resource-poor smallholder farming systems in sub-Saharan Africa causing crop losses accruing up to 88 %. Previous studies have shown that feeding by herbivorous insects induces maize to emit volatiles attractive to natural enemies. However, these antagonists are recruited when damage has already been inflicted on the plant. Recent investigations revealed that egg deposition can induce maize landraces of Mesoamerican origin to emit volatiles attractive to C. partellus parasitoids, a trait previously reported to be absent in maize hybrids. However, genotypic variation in this indirect defence trait within maize varieties adapted to local agroclimatic conditions and the effect of processes such as domestication and breeding on this trait are not known. Moreover, it is not known whether maize varieties possessing this indirect defence trait can directly deter further herbivore colonization and constitutively suppress the herbivore‟s larval development or whether they can induce the same defence trait in neighbouring unattacked plants. This study sought to fill these knowledge gaps with the aim of exploiting these plant defence traits in the development of ecologically sound crop protection strategies. Experiments were conducted in which headspace volatile samples were collected from plants of wild, landrace and hybrid maize with and without C. partellus eggs. Chemical analyses were done using gas chromatography (GC), coupled GC-mass spectrometry (GC-MS) and coupled GC-Electroantenography (GC-EAG). Behavioural bioassays were done using egg (Trichogramma bournieri Pintureau (Hymenoptera: Trichogrammatidae)) and larval (Cotesia sesamiae Cameron (Hymenoptera: Braconidae)) parasitoids in a 4 -arm olfactometer using volatiles collected from the plants. Moreover, C. partellus larval preference, growth and development as well as subsequent oviposition behaviour of gravid C. partellus moths on these plants were determined. Behavioural assays showed that both T. bournieri and C. sesamiae preferred volatiles from four of the five wild teosinte species, five landraces and one of two maize hybrids exposed to egg deposition. Similarly, volatiles collected from unoviposited maize landrace plants exposed to oviposited landrace maize plants emitting oviposition-induced volatiles, were attractive to both egg and larval parasitoids. Moreover, maize varieties emitting these oviposition-induced volatiles deterred further herbivore colonization and suppressed larval development. Volatile analysis by GC and GC-MS revealed marked increases in volatile emission as well as qualitative changes in the odour blends in four wild types, five landraces and one hybrid, following stemborer oviposition. Coupled GC-EAG analysis of attractive samples revealed that C. sesamiae was responsive to (E) - 2 - <b>hexenal,</b> (Z) - 3 -hexen- 1 -ol, nonane, 6 -methyl- 5 -heptene- 2 -one, α-pinene, myrcene, limonene, (E) - 4, 8 -dimethyl- 1, 3, 7 -nonatriene, decanal, 3, 4 -dimethylacetophenone and (E) -β-farnesene. Results from this study provide insights into tritrophic interactions thus paving the way for designing novel and ecologically sound pest management strategies through breeding crops with this novel oviposition-induced defence trait.

40|$|It is now {{generally}} {{acknowledged that}} {{particulate air pollution}} can cause respiratory symptoms and that indoor dust particles {{may be associated with}} mucous membrane irritation and odour annoyance. One reason for this may be that dust particles adsorb large quantities of gases and other volatile compounds. It is therefore important to be able to determine the chemical compounds adsorbed onto indoor dust particles. In this thesis, a new technique was developed that can analyse chemical compounds in indoor dust particles in a simple yet accurate way. In its basic configuration, it comprises a one stage thermal desorption oven, a gas flow cell with a miniaturized GC column, and a nitrogen-flushed photo diode array (PDA) detector for fast UV spectra recording. The dust sample is thermally desorbed in the oven and the released compounds are flushed onto the GC column by means of a carrier gas stream; the separated compounds are then registered by the PDA detector and identified by their characteristic gas-phase UV spectra. Using this set-up, a number of volatile organic as well as inorganic compounds were identified in indoor dust particles, e. g. nitric oxide, ammonia, hydrogen sulphide, pyridine, 2 -furaldehyde, 2 -methylfuran, and isoprene. Moreover, acrylate monomers were identified in dust samples from a secondary school with problems due to powdering floor polish. An instrumental set-up with higher performance was achieved by interfacing the gas flow cell to a capillary GC column. When airborne indoor dust samples were analysed by this system and by GC-MS under similar conditions of thermal desorption (150 °C) and GC separation, the two analytical systems were found to be complementary. GC-UV together with GC-MS was thus demonstrated to be considerably more powerful than GC-MS alone for the analysis of volatile organic compounds (VOC) in indoor dust. When airborne dust samples from damp (n= 9) and control (n= 9) residences were analysed for VOC and microorganisms, identifications made by culture and microscopy of the major moulds found, i. e. Aspergillus, Cladosporium and Penicillum, coincided with the identification of VOC known to be produced by these species. A number of additional VOC were also found, some of which may be irritating to the skin, eyes or respiratory tract if present at higher concentrations. Quantitative GC-UV analysis of indoor dust from 389 residences in Sweden showed that the VOC found at the highest concentrations were saturated aldehydes (C 5 -C 10), furfuryl alcohol, 2, 6 -di-tert-butyl- 4 -methylphenol, 2 -furaldehyde, and benzaldehyde. Alkenals were also found, notably 2 -butenal (crotonaldehyde), 2 -methyl-propenal (methacrolein), <b>hexenal,</b> heptenal, octenal, and nonenal. GC-UV was also applied (together with GC-MS) to determine VOC in dust from residences of 198 children with symptoms of asthma and/or allergy (cases) and from residences of 202 children without symptoms (controls). The mean concentration of nicotine was found to be significantly higher in dust from case residences, while the mean concentrations of hexane, nonanal, octane, 2 -pentylfuran and tridecanol were significantly higher in dust from control residences. In a stepwise logistic regression model, nicotine, hexanal, furfuryl alcohol, nonane, butanol, and octenal showed increased relative risks, expressed as odds ratios comparing cases with controls. By contrast, benzaldehyde, nonanal, butenal, hexane, tridecanol, and pentylfuran showed decreased relative risks. These findings point to the possibility that not only environmental tobacco smoke but also other emissions in the indoor environment may be linked to the increased prevalence of asthma and/or allergy in children. It is concluded that GC-UV may be used as an alternative or complement to GC-MS for measuring chemicals in indoor dust, thus improving the survey and control of human exposure to particle-bound toxicants and other chemicals.
