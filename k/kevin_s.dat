40|$|We {{propose a}} probabilistic, hierarchical, and {{discriminant}} (PHD) framework for fast and accurate detection of deformable anatomic structures from medical images. The PHD framework has three characteristics. First, it integrates distinctive primitives of the anatomic structures at global, segmental, and landmark levels in a probabilistic manner. Second, since {{the configuration of}} the anatomic structures lies in a high-dimensional parameter space, it seeks the best configuration via a hierarchical evaluation of the detection probability that quickly prunes the search space. Finally, to separate the primitive from the background, it adopts a discriminative boosting learning implementation. We apply the PHD framework for accurately detecting various deformable anatomic structures from M- mode and Doppler echocardiograms in about a second. <b>S.</b> <b>Kevin</b> Zhou, F. Guo, J. H.

Therefore, this trading component can be a useful building block in creating a comprehensive measure of liquidity. by Ka Yin <b>Kevin</b> Chu. Thesis (<b>S.</b> M.)

40|$|This thesis {{presents}} {{the development of}} a dimensionless blood microcirculation model for the study of blood microcirculation flows. It is a two dimensional, axially symmetric, incompressible, Newtonian-flow, Krogh cylinder model subjected to axially periodic boundary conditions. This model formulation allows {{for the use of the}} streamfunction-vorticity formulation of the Navier-Stokes equation, which offers simplification to boundary conditions and also allows for the use of a non-uniform, collocated mesh. A streamfunction vorticity formulation of the Immersed Boundary Method is also developed, specifically for the boundary conditions along the immersed boundary (red blood cell membrane). Periodic boundary conditions are used, with the assumption of fully-developed flow, in order to focus on the effects of the transient diffusion of oxygen into the surrounding tissue, orthogonal to the capillary flow direction. by <b>Kevin</b> Sabo.

We have studied the elastic constants of Cu/Nb composites with different layer thicknesses {{with a view to}} determining the elastic constants of Cu/Nb interfaces. Our work relied on resonant ultrasound spectroscopy (RUS) : a technique for deducing elastic constants from measured resonance frequencies. Resonance frequencies of three samples with differing layer widths were measured. A numerical approach for matching measured and computed resonance frequencies was developed and used in deducing the elastic constants of the composite. The uncertainties in the elastic constants thereby obtained were too large to estimate interface elastic properties. However, several sources of this uncertainty were identified, paving the way to improved elastic constant measurements in the future. by <b>Kevin</b> Galiano. Thesis (<b>S.</b> B.)

40|$|The {{absence of}} boreal forests from global policy agendas on {{sustainable}} development {{and climate change}} mitigation represents a massive missed opportunity for environmental protection. The boreal zone contains some of the world's largest pools of terrestrial carbon that, if not safeguarded from a conversion to a net source of greenhouse gases, could seriously exacerbate global climate change. At the same time, boreal countries have a strong tradition of forest management—expertise that could be effectively leveraged toward global and national carbon mitigation targets and sustainable development. Current obstacles against such contributions include weak incentives for carbon sequestration and a reluctance to embrace change by forest managers and policy makers.

Unknown to him, Crane and Kauffman had remembered him from when he auditioned for an earlier pilot of theirs; they had written the part of Ross with Schwimmer in mind to play him.

Executive producer <b>Kevin</b> <b>S.</b> Bright said that he had previously worked with Schwimmer, the character of Ross was written with him in mind, and he was the first actor cast. Schwimmer based Ross on Nicolas Cage's role of Charlie from the 1986 film Peggy Sue Got Married. The show debuted on September 22, 1994, and was watched by almost 22million American viewers.

40|$|The State of California faces a {{shortage}} of housing in many of its urban and suburban communities. This shortage has led to increasing home prices {{and there has been}} growing citizen demand to address housing affordability. The California State government recognized in 1992 that incentives were needed to stimulate the development of both housing that was designated for low-income residents and housing that was priced at market rate. The government understood that any law that acted as a further exaction on private developers would be counterproductive to their goals and thus adopted a density bonus program, to be implemented by local planning authorities, with the creation of California Government Code Sections 65915 through 65918. The paper will use three case studies to analyze the law's effectiveness as an incentive to private developers.
