5|$|The Fifth Test, {{played at}} the Oval, saw England win the toss and bat. They {{compiled}} 280, Mailey taking five wickets. Australia responded with 302, dismissed late on the second day. At stumps, England – <b>in</b> <b>their</b> <b>second</b> innings – were 0/49. A violent thunderstorm inundated the ground overnight, rendering the pitch sticky.
