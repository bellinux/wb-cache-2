25|$|A limb anomaly {{is called}} a dysmelia. These include all forms of limbs anomalies, such as amelia, <b>ectrodactyly,</b> phocomelia, polymelia, polydactyly, syndactyly, polysyndactyly, oligodactyly, brachydactyly, achondroplasia, {{congenital}} aplasia or hypoplasia, amniotic band syndrome, and cleidocranial dysostosis.|$|E
25|$|Patients {{suffer from}} dwarfism, short lower arms, small feet, and small hands. Fingers and toes {{may also be}} {{abnormally}} short and laterally or medially bent. The thumb may be displaced and some patients, notably in Turkey, experience <b>ectrodactyly.</b> All patients often suffer from vertebral segmentation abnormalities. Those with the dominant variant have, at most, a single butterfly vertebra. Those with the recessive form, however, may suffer from hemivertebrae, vertebral fusion, and rib anomalies. Some cases resemble Jarcho-Levin syndrome or spondylocostal dysostosis.|$|E
25|$|There is much {{discrepancy}} {{in the literature}} regarding {{the exact nature of}} the facial clefting involved in EEC. Some authors claim that the clefting involved in EEC is always cleft lip +/- palate and use this marker as a means of distinguishing EEC from other syndromes, such as AEC syndrome (ankyloblepharon, ectodermal dysplasia, and clefting) in which other types of clefting are found. Other authors include cleft palate only (CPO) in conjunction with <b>ectrodactyly</b> and ectodermal dysplasia as sufficient for a diagnosis of EEC.|$|E
25|$|Split hand/foot {{malformation}} (SHFM) {{is characterized}} by underdeveloped or absent central digital rays, clefts of hands and feet, and variable syndactyly of the remaining digits. SHFM is a heterogeneous condition caused by abnormalities at one of multiple loci, including SHFM1 (SHFM1 at 7q21-q22), SHFM2 (Xq26), SHFM3 (FBXW4/DACTYLIN at 10q24), SHFM4 (TP63 at 3q27), and SHFM5 (DLX1 and DLX 2 at 2q31). SHFM3 is unique {{in that it is}} caused by submicroscopic tandem chromosome duplications of FBXW4/DACTYLIN. SHFM3 is considered 'isolated' <b>ectrodactyly</b> and does not show a mutation of the tp63 gene.|$|E
500|$|Genetic {{disorders}} {{or unusual}} body features {{are not uncommon}} among Carnivàle actors. Michael J. Anderson (Samson) has osteogenesis imperfecta, a genetic bone disorder that leaves him at a size of 3ft7 (109cm), while Matthew McGrory (Giant) stood at 7ft6 (228cm) because of hyperpituitarism. Bree Walker (Sabina) has <b>ectrodactyly,</b> a rare genetic disorder that results in fused fingers and toes; she approached the producers in the second season to let her play a [...] "lobster gal". Several actors for one-time characters like the lobster gal in [...] "Hot and Bothered" [...] and Percy The Praying Mantis in [...] "The Road to Damascus" [...] were also cast for their respective real-life disabilities. Cameron Clapp (Management) had lost an arm and both legs in a train accident {{at the age of}} 15. Daniel Browning Smith (Rollo the Rubberboy) holds two Guinness World Records for his body-bending abilities. The actors playing the roles of the conjoined twins (Karyne and Sarah Steben, identical twins and real-life trapezists), Lila the Bearded Lady (Debra Christofferson) and Gecko the Lizard Man (John Fleck) are performers without genetic aberrances whose appearances were altered through makeup and prosthetics.|$|E
2500|$|<b>Ectrodactyly</b> can {{be caused}} by various changes to 7q. [...] When 7q is altered by a {{deletion}} or a translocation <b>ectrodactyly</b> can sometimes be associated with hearing loss.

2500|$|<b>Ectrodactyly</b> {{involves}} the deficiency {{or absence of}} one or more central digits of the hand or foot and is also known as split hand–split foot malformation (SHFM).

2500|$|A {{number of}} factors make the {{identification}} of the genetic defects underlying human <b>ectrodactyly</b> a complicated process: the limited number of families linked to each split hand/foot malformation (SHFM) locus, the large number of morphogens involved in limb development, the complex interactions between these morphogens, the involvement of modifier genes, and the presumed involvement of multiple gene or long-range regulatory elements in some cases of <b>ectrodactyly.</b> [...] In the clinical setting these genetic characteristics can become problematic and making predictions of carrier status and severity of the disease impossible to predict.|$|E
2500|$|Ectrodactyly–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome, or EEC, {{and also}} {{referred}} to as EEC syndrome (also known as [...] "Split hand–split foot–ectodermal dysplasia–cleft syndrome") is a rare form of ectodermal dysplasia, an autosomal dominant disorder inherited as an genetic trait. EEC is characterized by the triad of <b>ectrodactyly,</b> ectodermal dysplasia, and facial clefts. Other features noted in association with EEC include vesicoureteral reflux, recurrent urinary tract infections, obstruction of the nasolacrimal duct, decreased pigmentation of the hair and skin, missing or abnormal teeth, enamel hypoplasia, absent punctae in the lower eyelids, photophobia, occasional cognitive impairment and kidney anomalies, and conductive hearing loss.|$|E

5000|$|<b>Ectrodactyly</b> is {{frequently}} seen with other congenital anomalies. [...] Syndromes in which <b>ectrodactyly</b> {{is associated with}} other abnormalities can occur when two or more genes are affected by a chromosomal rearrangement. [...] Disorders associated with <b>ectrodactyly</b> include Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Clefting (EEC) syndrome, which is closely correlated to the ADULT syndrome and Limb-mammary (LMS) syndrome, Ectrodactyly-Cleft Palate (ECP) syndrome, Ectrodactyly-Ectodermal Dysplasia-Macular Dystrophy syndrome, Ectrodactyly-Fibular Aplasia/Hypoplasia (EFA) syndrome, and Ectrodactyly-Polydactyly. More than 50 syndromes and associations involving <b>ectrodactyly</b> are distinguished in the London Dysmorphology Database.|$|E
