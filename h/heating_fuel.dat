5|$|After the Gas Boom {{began to}} sweep {{the state in the}} 1880s, Lilly and other Commercial Club members {{advocated}} the creation of a public corporation to pump natural gas from the ground, pipe it to Indianapolis from the Trenton Gas Field, and provide it at low cost to businesses and homes. The project {{led to the creation of}} the Consumer Gas Trust Company, which Lilly named. The gas company provided low-cost <b>heating</b> <b>fuel</b> that made urban living much more desirable. The gas was further used to create electricity to run Indianapolis's first public transportation venture, a streetcar system.|$|E
5|$|Widespread {{blizzard}} conditions wrought {{havoc on}} transportation; streets and highways throughout the hardest-hit areas were clogged with stalled and abandoned vehicles, and multiple major airports {{were forced to}} close. Many schools and businesses were closed, some for days after the storm departed. The New York Stock Exchange opened an hour late on December 12, marking its first delayed opening in over 25years. Extensive drifting of snow left communities isolated and unable to receive deliveries of food and <b>heating</b> <b>fuel.</b> Overall, the storm and subsequent cold snap were blamed for at least 286deaths across a wide area, but primarily in Pennsylvania, New Jersey, New York, and the New England states. The fatalities resulted from a multitude of tragedies, including automobile and maritime accidents, storm-related fires, carbon monoxide poisoning, over-exertion, and exposure to cold.|$|E
5|$|Despite {{warnings}} from Noseworthy to control spending, Dunderdale's first budget saw spending increase by 4.9 percent. Spending {{was focused on}} infrastructure, health care, social programs, Nalcor Energy {{as well as other}} areas. The budget included tax credits for child care, volunteer fire fighters as well as an 8 percent Residential Energy Rebate on home <b>heating</b> <b>fuel,</b> which is equal to the provincial portion of the Harmonized Sales Tax (HST). The budget raised the threshold on the payroll tax exemption from $1 million to $1.2 million. Despite a $598 million surplus for the previous year and a $59 surplus forecasted for the coming year, the province's net debt was expected to increase from $8.2 billion to $8.67 billion due to unfunded liabilities. However, on November 16, 2011, Dunderdale's government released their Fall economic update and announced that the surplus for the 2011-2012, fiscal year was now projected to be $755.8 million, with the added surplus going towards the debt. In the audited financial statements released in January 2013, the surplus for the 2011-2012 was $882.8 million, with the overall debt falling to $7.8 billion.|$|E
40|$|Scale model <b>fuel</b> <b>heating</b> {{systems for}} use with {{aviation}} hydrocarbon fuel at low temperatures were investigated. The effectiveness of the heating systems in providing flowability and pumpability at extreme low temperature when some freezing of the fuel would otherwise occur is evaluated. The test tank simulated a section of an outer wing tank, and was chilled on {{the upper and lower}} surfaces. Turbine engine lubricating oil was <b>heated,</b> and recirculating <b>fuel</b> transferred the <b>heat.</b> <b>Fuels</b> included: a commercial Jet A; an intermediate freeze point distillate; a higher freeze point distillate blended according to Experimental Referee Broadened Specification guidelines; and a higher freeze point paraffinic distillate used in a preceding investigation. Each fuel was chilled to selected temperature to evaluate unpumpable solid formation (holdup). Tests simulating extreme cold weather flight, without <b>heating,</b> provided baseline <b>fuel</b> holdup data. <b>Heating</b> and recirculating <b>fuel</b> increased bulk temperature significantly; it had a relatively small effect on temperature {{near the bottom of the}} tank.

40|$|Many thermal {{management}} challenges have developed as advancements in {{gas turbine engine}} designs are made. As the thermal demands on gas turbine engines continue to increase, the heat sink available in the combustor fuel flow becomes more attractive. Increasing the temperature of fuel by {{using it as a}} heat sink can lead to higher combustion efficiency due to the increase in flow enthalpy and improved vaporization of the <b>heated</b> <b>fuel.</b> Emissions levels can also be affected by using <b>heated</b> <b>fuels</b> with the levels of carbon monoxide and unburned hydrocarbons tending to decrease while the amount of the oxides of nitrogen tends to increase. Although there are several benefits associated with using <b>heated</b> <b>fuels</b> in gas turbine engines, some problems can arise from their use including combustion instabilities, flashing within the fuel injector, and fuel coking or deposit formation within the fuel system. Various deoxygenation methods have been created to address the coking problem seen when using <b>heated</b> <b>fuels.</b> ^ In the Gas Turbine Test Cell of the High Pressure Laboratory at Purdue University 2 ̆ 7 s Maurice J. Zucrow Laboratories, a 5 MW combustion rig was developed to complete combustion test with <b>heated</b> <b>fuels.</b> The facility 2 ̆ 7 s supply systems including <b>heated</b> air, jet <b>fuel,</b> cooling water, and nitrogen were designed and integrated to produce simulated engine conditions within the combustion rig. <b>Heating</b> capabilities produced <b>fuel</b> temperatures ranging up to 600 deg F. Testing was completed with two fuel deoxygenation methods: nitrogen sparging and catalytic deoxygenation. ^ Results from the testing campaign included conventional pressure, temperature, and fuel property measurements; however, the most important measurements were the emissions samples that were analyzed for each test condition. Levels of carbon monoxide, unburned hydrocarbons, and oxides of nitrogen were determined as well as the combustion efficiency calculated from these emissions measurements. The trends in emissions and performance from the increase in fuel temperature will be discussed. In addition, high frequency pressure data were recorded during testing to monitor combustion instabilities. Fuel samples were also taken and analyzed to document the changes in the volatile composition of the fuel from the two deoxygenation methods. ^ The testing campaign was extremely successful. All project objectives were met with the <b>heated</b> <b>fuel</b> testing campaign. The combustion rig was run safely with fuel temperature up to 600 deg F, allowing the effects of elevated fuel temperatures on the performance and emissions of a gas turbine combustor to be evaluated as planned. ...|$|R

25|$|Older {{furnaces}} {{may contain}} rubber parts {{that would be}} affected by biodiesel's solvent properties, but can otherwise burn biodiesel without any conversion required. Care must be taken, however, given that varnishes left behind by petrodiesel will be released and can clog pipes- fuel filtering and prompt filter replacement is required. Another approach is to start using biodiesel as a blend, and decreasing the petroleum proportion over time can allow the varnishes to come off more gradually and be less likely to clog. Thanks to its strong solvent properties, however, the furnace is cleaned out and generally becomes more efficient.

25|$|During {{the siege}} of 1941 – 1944, the only ways to supply the city and suburbs, {{inhabited}} by several millions, were by aircraft or by cars crossing the frozen Lake Ladoga. The German military systematically shelled this route, called the Road of Life, so thousands of cars with people and food supplies had sank in the lake. The situation in the city was especially horrible {{in the winter of}} 1941 – 1942. The German bombing raids destroyed most of the food reserves. Daily food ration was cut in October to 400grams of bread for a worker and 200grams for a woman or child. On 20 November 1941, the rations were reduced to 250 and 125grams respectively. Those grams of bread were the bulk of a daily meal for a person in the city. The water supply was destroyed.
