5|$|Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII,</b> on October 4, 1962, {{became the}} first pope to use the Vatican railway during his pilgrimage to Loreto and Assisi one week before the {{beginning}} of Second Vatican Council using the Italian presidential train; the trip was broadcast on the Eurovision Network. Prior to John's trip in 1962, Pope Pius IX had been both the last pope to visit Loreto (as the head of the Papal States) and the last pope to travel by train. <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> also arranged for the major relics of Pope Pius X to be transferred to Venice using the Vatican railway.|$|E

5|$|When Ladislaus of Naples conquered Rome in 1413, <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> {{was forced}} to flee to Florence. He was {{compelled}} by Sigismund, Holy Roman Emperor, to convoke the Council of Constance in 1414, although when the threat to his pontificate and possibly his person became apparent, he fled in 1415. Although he expected his departure would disperse the council, the members of which he called to join him {{under the protection of}} Frederick IV, Duke of Austria, it continued to operate where they were. As <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> tried to make his way towards the territory of John II, Duke of Burgundy, Frederick IV surrendered him to the custody of Sigismund and the Council, and he was imprisoned by Louis III.|$|E
5|$|Various antipopes, however, {{received}} prominent burials, {{including one}} among the papal tombs in Old St. Peter's Basilica (which were destroyed during the sixteenth/seventeenth century demolition). In particular, the conciliar claimants of the Western Schism were entombed in elaborate tombs in important churches by famous sculptors. The tomb of Antipope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> typifies political iconography of antipapal burial, subtly arguing for {{the legitimacy of}} the entombed.|$|E
5|$|Within {{the first}} two weeks of the first session of the Council (October to December 1962) all seventy-two of the preparatory schemas had been {{rejected}} from consideration. The council rules had stipulated a necessary two-thirds supermajority to reject the schemas. Although only 60% had voted against the schemas, they were regardless discarded at the intervention of Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII,</b> upon the request of the liberal Council Fathers.|$|E

5|$|Antipope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> had a {{complicated}} life, legacy, and {{relationship with the}} city of Florence. Baldassare Cossa was a Neapolitan nobleman who grew up in Bologna. Pope Boniface IX elevated Cossa to the Archdiocese of Bologna in 1396 and made him a cardinal in 1402. After the Council of Pisa in 1409, Cossa encouraged rebellion against Pope Gregory XII, who refused to resign. Cossa was deprived of his cardinalate, but it was restored by Antipope Alexander V, who had been elected by the council.|$|E
5|$|In 1958 Pope Pius XII {{died and}} was succeeded by Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII,</b> who, in 1959, after giving Lefebvre {{the choice between}} {{remaining}} either as Apostolic Delegate or as Archbishop of Dakar, appointed another to the post of Apostolic Delegate for French Africa. Lefebvre continued as Archbishop of Dakar until 23 January 1962, when he {{was transferred to the}} diocese of Tulle in France, retaining his personal title of archbishop. Shortly after his appointment as Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers (see below), he resigned from the diocese of Tulle on 7 August, 1962.|$|E
5|$|Upon {{his return}} to Europe he was elected Superior General of the Holy Ghost Fathers and {{assigned}} {{to participate in the}} drafting and preparation of documents for the upcoming Second Vatican Council (1962–65) announced by Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII,</b> and was a major leader of the conservative bloc during its proceedings. He would later take the lead in opposing certain changes within the Church associated with the Council. Refusing to implement council-inspired reforms demanded by its members, he resigned from the leadership of the Holy Ghost Fathers in 1968.|$|E

As a result, the New Brunswick Fishermen's Disaster Fund was created to assist the families.

The same engine was used by the Italian royal family, and also hauled the train which carried Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> to Loreto and Assisi in 1962. Scheduled trains use contemporary suburban rolling stock to travel from Vatican City railway station to Albano Laziale, via Castel Gandolfo.|$|E
5|$|By {{the close}} of 1961, the Food for Peace program was {{operating}} in a dozen countries, and 10 million more people had been fed with American surplus than the year before. In February 1962, McGovern visited India and oversaw a greatly expanded school lunch program thanks to Food for Peace; subsequently one in five Indian schoolchildren would be fed from it, and by mid-1962, 35 million children around the world. During an audience in Rome, Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> warmly praised McGovern's work, and the distribution program was also popular among South Dakota's wheat farmers. In addition, McGovern {{was instrumental in the}} creation of the United Nations-run World Food Programme in December 1961; it started distributing food to stricken regions of the world the following year and would go on to become the largest humanitarian agency fighting hunger worldwide.|$|E

40|$|Background. Hereditary diffuse {{gastric cancer}} is {{associated}} with the E-cadherin germline mutations, but genetic determinants have not been identified for familial intestinal gastric carcinoma. The guidelines for hereditary diffuse gastric cancer are clearly established; however, there are no defined recommendations for the management of familial intestinal gastric carcinoma. Methods. In this study we describe Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII's</b> pedigree that harboured gastric cancer as well as six other family members. Family history was analysed according to the International Gastric Cancer Linkage Consortium criteria, and gastric tumours were classified in accord with the last Japanese guidelines. Results. Seven out of 109 members in this pedigree harboured gastric cancer, affecting two consecutive generations. <b>John</b> <b>XXIII's</b> clinical tumour (cTN) was classified as cT 4 bN 3 a (IV stage). In two other cases, gastric carcinomas were classified as intestinal histotype and staged as pT 1 bN 0 and pT 2 N 2, respectively. Conclusions. Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII's</b> family presents a strong aggregation for gastric cancer affecting almost seven members; it spreads through two consecutive generations. In absence of defined genetic causes and considering the increased risk of gastric cancer’s development in these families, as well as the high mortality rates and advanced stages, we propose an intensive surveillance protocol for asymptomatic members...|$|R

5|$|In the meantime, the Council deposed <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> on May 29, 1415 {{and elected}} Pope Martin V on November 11, 1417; Martin V {{proceeded}} to Florence in February 1419. Cossa was ransomed by the Republic of Florence in 1419 (Louis III {{had abandoned the}} allegiance of Sigismund in 1417), as orchestrated by Giovanni di Bicci de' Medici. His ransom {{may have been a}} reward for past assistance to Florence, or a manoeuvre to put pressure on Martin V (still in Florence; he would arrive in Rome in September 1420), or both. Cossa had helped Florence conquer Pisa in 1405 in his capacity as Papal legate to Bologna and, as pope, had designated the Medici bank as the depository-general for the papal finances.|$|E
5|$|On {{top of the}} sarcophagus, the bier of the effigy is {{supported}} by lions whose shape mimics Trecento consoles. The lions may {{be based on the}} Florentine , as if to mark <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> {{in the same manner as}} a conquered city-state. As Donatello's Marzocco for the papal apartment in Santa Maria Novella conveyed Florence's ambivalence towards Martin V (as both a source of prestige by visiting, and a potential adversary of the Republic), the lions supporting the bier contextualize the tomb monument's support for John XXIII's claim to the papacy by cementing it as a Florentine claim. Yet, any iconographical interpretation of the lions must be taken with a grain of salt as lions are symbolically promiscuous, and are also seen as supports on earlier tombs, such as that of Lapo de' Bardi (d.1342) in the Bargello.|$|E
5|$|Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> issued eight Papal Encyclicals {{during his}} five-year reign as Pope of the Roman Catholic Church, from his {{election}} on October 28, 1958 {{until his death}} on June 3, 1963. Two of his encylicals, Mater et magistra and Pacem in terris, are especially important. A Papal Encyclical is a letter sent by the Pope which is addressed to Roman Catholic bishops {{in a particular area}} or the whole world. Encyclicals may condemn errors, point out threats to faith and morals, exhort faithful practices, or provide remedies for present and future dangers to the church. The authority of the encyclical varies depending on the circumstances and is not necessarily ex cathedra. The title of a Papal Encyclical is usually taken from its first few words.|$|E
50|$|During Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII's</b> pontificate, {{the regime}} {{successfully}} bypassed the Polish episcopate by {{being allowed to}} directly negotiate with the vatican, which allowed the government to isolate the polish episcopate.

5|$|The Hungarians, Saxons and Székelys {{adhered to}} Roman Catholicism. The Diocese of Transylvania {{included}} {{most of the}} province, but the Saxons of Southern Transylvania were subjected to the archbishops of Esztergom. Catholic commoners were to pay an ecclesiastic tax, the tithe, but <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> exempted the lesser noblemen from paying it in 1415. However, George Lépes, the bishop of Transylvania, ignored this decision, especially after John had been declared an antipope. They were originally exempt from the ecclesiastic tax, but Sigismund of Luxemburg, king of Hungary, decreed that the Vlachs who settled on lands abandoned by Catholic peasants were to also pay the tithe. Sigismund was an absent monarch, deeply involved in European politics; he spent much time outside Hungary, especially in his other realms, such as Germany and Bohemia.|$|E
5|$|The 1962 {{edition of}} the Roman Missal, {{published}} {{a few months before}} the Second Vatican Council opened, was the last that presented the Mass as standardised in 1570 by Pope Pius V {{at the request of the}} Council of Trent and that is therefore known as the Tridentine Mass. Pope Pius V's Roman Missal was subjected to minor revisions by Pope Clement VIII in 1604, Pope Urban VIII in 1634, Pope Pius X in 1911, Pope Pius XII in 1955, and Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> in 1962. Each successive edition was the ordinary form of the Roman Rite Mass until superseded by a later edition. When the 1962 edition was superseded by that of Paul VI, promulgated in 1969, its continued use at first required permission from bishops; but Pope Benedict XVI's 2007 motu proprio Summorum Pontificum allowed free use of it for Mass celebrated without a congregation and authorised parish priests to permit, under certain conditions, its use even at public Masses. Except for the scriptural readings, which Pope Benedict allowed to be proclaimed in the vernacular language, it is celebrated exclusively in liturgical Latin.|$|E
5|$|The {{heritage}} of the region includes numerous landmarks, especially manor houses built by the nobility in largely in the 18th and the 19th centuries. Those include Prandau-Normann and Prandau-Mailath manor houses in Valpovo and Donji Miholjac respectively, manor houses in Baranja—in Bilje, at a former Esterházy estate in Darda, in Tikveš, and in Kneževo. Pejačevićs built several residences, the most representative ones among them being manor house in Virovitica and the Pejačević manor house in Našice. Further east, along the Danube, there are Odescalchi manor house in Ilok, and Eltz manor house in Vukovar—the latter sustained extensive damage during the Battle of Vukovar in 1991, but it was reconstructed by 2011. In the southeast of the region, the most prominent are Kutjevo Jesuit manor house, and Cernik manor house, located in Kutjevo and Cernik respectively. The period also saw construction of Tvrđa and Brod fortifications in Osijek and Slavonski Brod. Older, medieval fortifications are preserved only as ruins—the largest among those being Ružica Castle near Orahovica. Another landmark dating to the 19th century is the Đakovo Cathedral—hailed by the Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII</b> as the most beautiful church situated between Venice and Istanbul.|$|E
50|$|Before Pope <b>John</b> <b>XXIII's</b> {{revision}} in 1960, the Roman Calendar {{also included}} on 18 January another {{feast of the}} Chair of Saint Peter (denominated the Chair of Saint Peter in Rome, while the February feast was then called that of the Chair of Saint Peter at Antioch), and on 1 August the feast of Saint Peter in Chains.|$|R
5000|$|Continued {{use of the}} {{expression}} [...] "people of God" [...] (in Latin, populus Dei) {{in the writings of}} the Church Fathers are found in Augustine's De civitate Dei and Pope Leo I's Lenten Sermon.
