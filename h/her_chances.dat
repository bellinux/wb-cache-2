5|$|Bina Agarwal and Pradeep Panda {{illustrate}} that a woman's property status (such as owning {{a house or}} land) directly and significantly reduces <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> of experiencing domestic violence, while employment makes little difference. They argue that such immovable property increases women's self-esteem, economic security, and strengthens their fall-back positions, enhancing their options and bargaining clout. They show that property ownership is an important contributor to women's economic well-being because it reduces their susceptibility to violence.|$|E

Many Aes Sedai are captured or killed until Egwene, leading {{a group of}} novices, succeeds in driving them off. Siuan Sanche, Gawyn Trakand, and Gareth Bryne mount a rescue of Egwene. They find her so exhausted that she cannot protest when they extract her against her orders.

5|$|On February 16, 2013, at age 37, Jolie {{underwent}} a preventive double mastectomy after learning {{she had an}} 87% risk of developing breast cancer due to a defective BRCA1 gene. Her maternal family history warranted genetic testing for BRCA mutations: her mother, actress Marcheline Bertrand, had breast cancer and died from ovarian cancer, while her grandmother died from ovarian cancer. Her aunt, who had the same BRCA1 defect, died from breast cancer three months after Jolie's operation. Following the mastectomy, which lowered <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> of developing breast cancer to under 5 percent, Jolie had reconstructive surgery involving implants and allografts. Two years later, in March 2015, after annual test results indicated possible signs of early ovarian cancer, she {{underwent a}} preventive oophorectomy, as she had a 50% risk of developing ovarian cancer due to the same genetic anomaly. Despite hormone replacement therapy, the surgery brought on premature menopause.|$|E

To minimize her habituation to humans, {{she needed to be}} moved as soon as possible and had to be released during the time her pod was usually present in Johnstone Strait between May 6 and July 25, usually in mid-July. On July 9, OrcaLab detected orca calls closely related to Springer's, moving towards Johnstone Strait.|$|E

Each year in the United States, diabetic retinopathy accounts for 12% of all new cases of blindness. It is also the leading cause of blindness for people aged 20 to 64 years.|$|E
25|$|Rodriguez-Trias's {{mother was}} a school teacher in Puerto Rico. However, in New York, she {{was not able to}} get a teacher's license because, at that time, {{bilingualism}} was considered a handicap. Therefore, her mother had to take in boarders in order to meet her financial needs and to pay the rent. After Rodriguez-Trias graduated from high school, she decided that she would like to study medicine and that <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> would be much better in Puerto Rico, because the island had a good scholarship system.|$|E
25|$|Zach and Kendall's {{romance is}} shot to crumbs when Kendall learns that Zach caused the {{blackout}} which spun {{her in the}} position of having to carry her own child with Ryan instead of Greenlee's. Zach voices to Kendall that he arranged the blackout to sabotage <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> of surrogacy because he wanted to protect her from a dangerous Ryan. Kendall does not care for Zach's reasons and breaks off her romantic ties to him, just as she is not feeling the maternal instinct. Zach also loses his son, Ethan, to death around this same time, and loses Kendall as well.|$|E

Wozniacki had <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> in the first set, rallying from 2–4 to 5–4 and holding triple set point with Radwańska falling into a 0–40 hole in the next game; Radwańska snuck that game out and took the first set, Radwańska then started to be bothered by her shoulder injury and started to go for her shots but Wozniacki wouldn't lose her cool, comfortably taking the second set and holding steady from 4–all in the third {{to close the door}} on the two-hour, 39-minute marathon.|$|E
25|$|Thredson also {{suggests}} aversion therapy to Lana (Sarah Paulson), who thinks {{there is no}} cure for her homosexuality. He says they should try as it will increase <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> of a release. She relents, at first, but agrees and he shows her slides of nude women to aid her repulsion. He then brings in a male patient and has Lana touch both the patient and herself in sexual manner. She cannot complete this form of therapy. Thredson later promises Lana that he will take her with him when his asylum visit is over in a week.|$|E
25|$|Following her setback, Sunhwa {{went back}} to being an {{ordinary}} high school student. However, {{there was a big}} change in the way Sunhwa's peers looked at her: due to false rumors, they thought she was a JYP trainee; Sunhwa admitted she became afraid of people because of the jealous stares. Teacher Sung Yongho, in charge of the school choir, helped Sunhwa, giving <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> to participate in competitions; then, she was admitted to Baekjae Art College. A few days before the college entrance ceremony, she got a call from an agent who watched Superstar Survival and became a trainee in TS Entertainment.|$|E

25|$|Durova's {{youthful}} appearance hurt <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> for promotion. In an {{era when}} Russian officers were expected to grow a mustache {{she looked like a}} boy of sixteen. She transferred away from the hussars to the Lithuanian Uhlan Regiment {{in order to avoid the}} colonel's daughter who had fallen in love with her. Durova saw action again during Napoleon's invasion of Russia in 1812. She fought in the Battle of Smolensk. During the Battle of Borodino a cannonball wounded her in the leg, yet she continued serving full duty for several days afterward until her command ordered her away to recuperate. She retired from the army in 1816 with the rank of stabs-rotmistr, the equivalent of captain-lieutenant.|$|E
25|$|Ahead of the 1998 federal election, {{an electoral}} {{redistribution}} essentially split Oxley in half. Oxley was reconfigured as a marginal Labor seat, losing {{most of its}} more rural and exurban area while picking up the heavily pro-Labor suburb of Inala. A new seat of Blair {{was created in the}} rural area surrounding Ipswich. Hanson knew <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> of holding the reconfigured Oxley were slim, especially after former Labor state premier Wayne Goss won preselection for the seat. After considering whether to contest a Senate seat—which, by most accounts, she would have been heavily tipped to win—she opted to contest Blair. Despite its very large notional Liberal majority (18.7 percent), most of her base was now located there.|$|E
25|$|Her {{place on}} the Kenyan world cross country team looked {{uncertain}} in 2009 as head coach Julius Kirwa dismissed <b>her</b> <b>chances,</b> saying she had run too many races that season. Cherono replied by taking the lead immediately at the Kenyan Trials and winning the junior race {{by a margin of}} thirteen seconds. At the 2009 World Cross Country Championships in Amman, Cherono engaged in a race-long duel with Genzebe Dibaba in the junior race. Cherono took the lead in the final stages but a difficult stretch with a 40-metre climb enabled Dibaba to overtake her and Cherono ended up with the silver medal. At the 2009 African Junior Athletics Championships, Cherono eased to the 3000m title by some 13 seconds but found herself beaten again by Genzebe Dibaba in 5000m race, finishing with the silver medal. She competed on the senior track circuit that year and was third at the Rieti IAAF Grand Prix, recording a personal best of 8:44.67 for the 3000m. She took third for a second time at the Memorial van Damme in September, recording personal bests in the 1500 metres and 2000 metres and beaten only by reigning world champions Gelete Burka and Vivian Cheruiyot.|$|E

25|$|In May 1988, Zia {{dissolved}} the assemblies {{and called}} a November election. He {{had not wanted}} Bhutto to win, and his choice of date may have been deliberately chosen {{to coincide with the}} date when Bhutto was projected to give birth, thus hindering her ability to campaign. He also sought to hinder <b>her</b> <b>chances</b> by declaring that the election would be held on a non-party basis, with candidates standing as individuals rather than as representatives of a political party. Bhutto and the PPP launched a legal challenge against this latter stipulation. In August, Zia suddenly died when his aircraft crashed shortly after take-off from Bahawalpur Airport. A joint U.S.-Pakistani investigation was unable to ascertain the cause of the crash, although sabotage was widely suspected. After his death, the Supreme Court announced that the election should take place on a party basis, rather than the non-party basis that Zia had desired. Bhutto insisted that the PPP campaign separately from the MRD, and dropped its socialist platform in favour of economic Thatcherism and a commitment to the free market. Amid predictions that the PPP would win, it received 18,000 prospective candidates, many offering the party money for their selection; this influx of new members and candidates caused upset among many established members, who felt that Bhutto was deserting them.|$|E
