5|$|The Mets {{performance}} in the playoffs drew heavy television viewership, with the decisive game of the NLCS scoring the highest ratings for any League Championship Series broadcast since 1993. Overall the NLCS averaged 10.9 million viewers, 18% higher than the NLCS <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> the year before. Variety writer Tom Bierbaum argued {{this was a good}} sign for the future of baseball because the Mets and Boston Red Sox <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> younger viewers during their time in the postseason. Bierbaum believed that baseball needed fresh teams, not just the often-successful Yankees and Braves, to draw new audiences and grow viewership.|$|E

5|$|Jean-Baptiste Jourdan {{received}} {{command of}} the Army of Observation in September 1798, from its temporary commander, Pierre Marie Barthélemy Ferino.

50|$|Yisrael Beiteinu <b>has</b> <b>drawn</b> equally strong {{criticism}} from the Left, in large {{part due to the}} Lieberman Plan's proposed land and population transfers along ethnic lines.

5|$|As the Royal Rumble match began, it was {{revealed}} that Scott Steiner was the first participant and his former rival Samu <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> the number two position. Early in the match, Diesel tied a WWF record by throwing out seven consecutive wrestlers. He was ultimately eliminated by a group of wrestlers, while his partner Shawn Michaels kept aloof. Although Diesel wrestled as a heel at the time, his performance earned him applause from the crowd.|$|E
5|$|By this time, {{the route}} from Quainton Road to Brill was in severe decline. Competition from the newer lines and from {{improving}} road haulage <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> away {{much of the}} tramway's custom, and the trains would often run without a single passenger. The A Class locomotives were now 70 years old, and the track itself was poorly maintained. Trains, once again, were regularly derailing on the line.|$|E
5|$|Coal {{balls in}} North America were first found in Iowa coal seams in 1894, {{although}} {{the connection to}} European coal balls was not made until Adolf Carl Noé (whose coal ball was found by Gilbert Cady) drew the parallel in 1922. Noé's work renewed interest in coal balls, and by the 1930s <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> paleobotanists from Europe to the Illinois Basin in search of them.|$|E

5|$|In 1823 Helm {{called on}} Representative Benjamin Hardin. While Hardin and Helm {{discussed}} business, Hardin's 14-year-old daughter, Lucinda, {{entered the room}} to show her father a map she <b>had</b> <b>drawn.</b> Helm later claimed {{it was love at}} first sight, and began to pursue Lucinda's affections. They courted for seven years, married in 1830 and had six daughters and five sons together. One of his sons, Benjamin Hardin Helm, was a Confederate general in the Civil War and was killed at the Battle of Chickamauga.|$|E
5|$|In September 2010 Willie Walsh, now CEO of IAG, {{announced}} that the group was considering acquiring other airlines and <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> up a shortlist of twelve possible acquisitions. In November 2011 IAG announced an agreement in principle to purchase British Midland International from Lufthansa. A contract to purchase the airline was agreed the next month, and the sale was completed for £172.5 million on 30 March 2012. The airline established a new subsidiary based at London City Airport operating Airbus A318s.|$|E
5|$|In a {{preface to}} his 1926 drama Korbannja Kong-Ek (The Victim of Kong-Ek), Kwee Tek Hoay {{wrote that he}} <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> {{inspiration}} from the realist Norwegian playwright Henrik Ibsen in that work, having read and reread the author's plays. Damono finds signs of Ibsen's influence already present in Allah jang Palsoe. He compares the stage directions in Allah jang Palsoe to those in Ibsen's Hedda Gabler and finds them to be similar in their level of detail.|$|E

5|$|Involvement in the Spanish Civil War <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> Mussolini {{closer to}} Hitler, helping to get Mussolini's {{agreement}} for Hitler's plans for union (Anschluss) with Austria. The authoritarian Catholic, anti-Nazi Vaterländische Front government of autonomous Austria had been successfully opposing {{the rise of}} Fascism, and following the assassination of Austria's authoritarian chancellor, Engelbert Dollfuss in 1934, had already successfully invoked Italian military assistance {{in case of a}} German invasion. Hitler's need to prevent an Italian invasion was settled with the Rome-Berlin Axis, partway into the Spanish Civil War.|$|E
5|$|Nevertheless, {{the assault}} of the 2nd New Zealand Division <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> in both 15 and 21 Panzer Divisions, {{with the result}} that there was a wide gap in the Axis lines to the south west. Through this gap Montgomery pushed the {{remainder}} of his armour, breaking the Afrika Korps line and pushing westwards into its rear areas and supply lines. By 4 November, the battle was won and Montgomery was entertaining the captured Afrika Korps commander, von Thoma, to dinner in his caravan.|$|E
5|$|Pauline Fowler {{is one of}} the {{original}} twenty-three characters invented by the creators of EastEnders, Tony Holland (1940–2007) and Julia Smith (1927–1997). Holland <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> on his own London background for inspiration, naming three of {{the original}} characters after his own relatives, specifically his aunt Lou and her children, Holland's cousins, the fraternal twins Pete and Pauline. This family setup of a woman named Lou Beale, with twin children Pete and Pauline, was recreated on-screen as the first family of EastEnders, the Beales and Fowlers.|$|E

5|$|Since 1986, Bath City <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> a {{significant}} amount of income from allowing Football League club Bristol Rovers to share their Twerton Park ground; Rovers' return to Bristol {{at the end of the}} 1995–96 season meant that savings needed to be made, including cuts in the playing budget. Together with teammate Rob Cousins, Gill joined local rivals Yeovil Town for the 1996–97 season for a fee of £9,500.|$|E
5|$|Viewers {{of early}} footage {{encouraged}} DiDuro to separate it further from Sonic, so he replaced rings with red leaves and altered the characters' abilities. Ziyo <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> Lilac as a hedgehog, but DiDuro redesigned the character to be a dragon. Lilac's wall-jump ability {{was based on}} a similar game mechanic from Ristar. Originally, her level of energy was to be dependent on her speed, but this proved too difficult to control.|$|E
5|$|When Scott finally read Zelda's book, a {{week after}} she'd sent it to Perkins, he was furious. The book was a semi-autobiographical account of the Fitzgeralds' marriage.

5|$|Although {{the threat}} from the French Fleet had been neutralised, Cunningham was still aware of {{the threat posed by}} the Italian Fleet to British North African operations, based in Egypt. Although the Royal Navy had won in several actions in the Mediterranean, {{considerably}} upsetting the balance of power, the Italians who were following the theory of a fleet in being had left their ships in harbour. This made the threat of a sortie against the British Fleet a serious problem. At the time the harbour at Taranto contained six battleships (five of them battle-worthy), seven heavy cruisers, two light cruisers, and eight destroyers. The Admiralty, concerned with the potential for an attack, <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> up Operation Judgement; a surprise attack on Taranto Harbour. To carry out the attack, the Admiralty sent the new aircraft carrier , commanded by Lumley Lyster, to join HMS Eagle in Cunningham's fleet.|$|E
5|$|As in Iaşi, Goldfaden {{arrived in}} Bucharest with his {{reputation}} already established. He and his players performed {{first in the}} early spring at the salon Lazăr Cafegiu on Calea Văcăreşti (Văcăreşti Avenue, {{in the heart of the}} ghetto), then, once the weather turned warm, at the Jigniţa garden, a pleasant tree-shaded beer garden on Str. Negru Vodă that up until then <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> only a neighborhood crowd. He filled out his cast from the great pool of Jewish vocal talent: synagogue cantors. He also recruited two eminently respectable classically trained prima donnas, the sisters Margaretta and Annetta Schwartz.|$|E
5|$|As {{the reigning}} {{champions of the}} UEFA Champions League, Manchester United began their title defence at the group stage, {{for which they were}} given the top seed. This {{position}} amongst the top eight European clubs meant that they would avoid drawing former European champions Barcelona, Internazionale and Real Madrid until at least the first knockout round, although they were {{faced with the prospect of}} drawing Bayern Munich or Roma. Nevertheless, United ended up being drawn into Group E with two teams they had played against before: Villarreal (whom they <b>had</b> <b>drawn</b> in 2005–06) and Celtic (2006–07); and one they had not: Aalborg BK.|$|E
