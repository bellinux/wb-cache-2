5|$|Converting Campbeltown for {{the raid}} took ten days. She {{had to be}} {{lightened}} to raise her draught {{to get over the}} sand banks in the estuary. This was achieved by completely stripping all her internal compartments. The dockyard removed her three 4inch (100mm) guns, torpedoes and depth charges <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and replaced the forward gun with a light quick–firing 12 pounder (3"). Eight 20mm Oerlikons were installed on mountings raised above deck level. The bridge and wheelhouse were given extra armour-plate protection, and two rows of armour were fixed along the sides of the ship to protect the Commandos on the open deck.|$|E
5|$|Each {{bulkhead}} {{could be}} sealed by watertight doors. The engine rooms and boiler {{rooms on the}} tank top deck had vertically closing doors that could be controlled remotely from the bridge, lowered automatically by a float if water was present, or closed manually by the crew. These took about 30 seconds to close; warning bells and alternate escape routes were provided so that the crew would not be trapped by the doors. Above the tank top level, on the Orlop Deck, F Deck and E Deck, the doors closed horizontally and were manually operated. They could be closed at the door itself or <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> above.|$|E
5|$|On the {{afternoon}} of 11 April 1975, the 31st MAU received orders to execute Operation Eagle Pull. At 06:00 on 12 April, 12 CH-53s of HMH-462 launched <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of USS Okinawa and then at 10-minute intervals descended again {{to pick up their}} marines. Elements of Companies F and H, and the command group embarked from the USS Okinawa while elements of Company G boarded their helicopters on the USS Vancouver, giving a total ground security force of 360 Marines. As the helicopters completed loading they formed into groups of three orbiting the task force.|$|E

50|$|During 1998 <b>the</b> Marauders {{operated}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> {{of three}} different U.S. aircraft carriers and visited seven different countries.|$|R
5000|$|For eight players, they remove three One cards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> (i.e., a red One, yellow One, {{and green}} One).|$|R
5|$|The {{original}} {{set of rules}} prescribed that all games were to be played for ante. Garfield was partly inspired by the game of marbles and wanted folks {{to play with the}} cards rather than collect them. For Magic, each player removed a card at random <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> they wished to play with and the two cards would be set aside as the ante. At the end of the match, the winner would take and keep both cards. Early sets included a few cards with rules designed to interact with this gambling aspect, allowing replacements of cards up for ante, adding more cards to the ante, or even permanently trading cards in play.|$|E
5|$|With {{his enemy}} visible <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of his {{flagship}} by 06:30, Howe recalled his frigates and ordered his fleet {{to press on}} all sail {{in the hope of}} engaging the rear of the scattered French line. By 10:35 Howe's continued pursuit was making his own battleline ragged, but he pressed on in the belief that Villaret intended to use the weather gage to outrun him and escape. To counter this, Howe ordered his fastest ships into a flying squadron under Admiral Thomas Pasley. This squadron was significantly faster than the majority of the vessels in either fleet and rapidly closed with the French rear. The first shots of the engagement were fired at 14:30 by HMS Russell, commanded by John Willett Payne, which managed some long-distance fire at the rearmost French ships on the opposite tack. Fire was returned by the French but without significant effect. In an attempt to hold off Pasley's squadron, at 17:00 the French first rate 110-gun Révolutionnaire exchanged places with the smaller third rates {{at the rear of the}} line and engaged the pursuing British van. This manoeuvre was apparently conducted on the initiative of Captain Vandangel of Révolutionnaire without orders from Admiral Villaret or his political observer Jean Bon Saint-André.|$|E
25|$|Given any two cards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> {{there is}} one and only one other card that forms a set with them.|$|E
5000|$|For six players, they remove five number One cards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> (i.e., a red One, green One, black One, {{and both}} yellow Ones).|$|R
25|$|My friend Clinch Smith {{made the}} {{proposition}} that we should leave and go toward the stern. But there arose before us <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> below a mass of humanity several lines deep converging on <b>the</b> Boat <b>Deck</b> facing us and completely blocking our passage to the stern. There were women in the crowd {{as well as men}} and these seemed to be steerage passengers who had just come up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> below. Even among these people there was no hysterical cry, no evidence of panic. Oh the agony of it.|$|R
50|$|Admiral Fitzgerald’s {{personal}} awards include:He has logged over 4800 {{flight hours}} {{and has made}} over 1100 carrier arrested landings <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of thirteen aircraft carriers.|$|R
25|$|The {{ashes of}} the noted {{fisheries}} scientist Oscar Elton Sette (1900–1972) were scattered at sea in the Pacific Ocean <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of David Starr Jordan on 7 September 1972.|$|E
25|$|As {{part of its}} ASW program, the Coast Guard began {{experimenting with}} ship-based {{helicopter}} operations. Initially, a series of flights was conducted <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of a ship at anchor, Bunker Hill. When these trials proved successful, the Coast Guard moved to open sea trials.|$|E
25|$|On 13 November, Kisch defied Australian {{authorities}} when {{he jumped}} over five metres <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of the Strathaird onto Melbourne's Station Pier, breaking his right leg. The Victoria Police quickly {{took charge of}} Kisch and carried him back on board the Strathaird.|$|E

25|$|Five Players: There are no partnerships; players {{play for}} themselves. 2 and 2 are removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> and each player is dealt 10 cards. Alternatively, if three Jokers are available, {{they may be}} added as either highest trump or as junk cards, thus dealing each player 11 cards each.|$|E
25|$|The deck is {{typically}} {{held in a}} modified mechanic's grip in the dealer's non-dominant hand. The dealer slides the top card partially off the deck as if to deal it, while the dominant hand instead takes hold of the bottom card. The card is snapped away <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> while the top card is reset.|$|E
25|$|Sette {{died at the}} age of 72 on July 25, 1972 in Los Altos, California, {{where he}} and his wife had resided for a number of years. He was cremated, and his ashes were {{scattered}} at sea in the Pacific Ocean <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of the NOAA research ship NOAAS David Starr Jordan (R 444) on September 7, 1972.|$|E
60|$|The Castilla was {{in flames}} from stem to stern. Black smoke poured up <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of <b>the</b> Isla de Cuba, {{and on the}} flag-ship fire was {{completing}} the work of destruction begun by the American shells.|$|R

60|$|The pandemonium {{that had}} broken out below us was deafening. Rifles cracked, {{officers}} shouted orders, men yelled directions to one another <b>from</b> <b>the</b> water and <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of myriad boats, while through all ran the purr of countless propellers cutting water and air.|$|R
25|$|The trawler Koraaga {{continued}} to work hard but returned early to Sydney late on Wednesday 2 October 1929 with a broken foremast. As early on the Tuesday, morning, when the ship was 28 miles south of Cape Everard, the mast broke about 10 feet <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> under the strain of a trawl full of fish which was being hauled in. No one was injured.|$|E
25|$|Russia was {{scheduled}} to hand over Vikramaditya to India on 4 December 2012, with sea trials scheduled to begin on 29 May 2012. The sea trials in fact began on 8 June. The ship sailed out for pre-delivery trials from the berth of the Sevmash shipyard in Russia's northern city of Severodvinsk. These trials were to include landing and take-off of fighter jets <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of the carrier.|$|E
25|$|Several {{techniques}} {{are used for}} water entry from boats, depending on {{the layout of the}} vessel, particularly the freeboard at the entry points. Large dive boats often have a permanent or folding platform at the stern just above the water, intended to make water entry and exit safer and more convenient for divers. Such platforms will usually be provided with steps or ladders <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> and folding ladders into the water.|$|E
60|$|In {{due time}} {{the shores of}} Italy were sighted, and as we stood gazing <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks,</b> early in <b>the</b> bright summer morning, the stately city of Genoa rose {{up out of the}} sea and flung back <b>the</b> {{sunlight}} <b>from</b> her hundred palaces.|$|R
50|$|The Handley Page HP.14, also {{designated}} Handley Page R/200 was {{a prototype}} British naval reconnaissance aircraft of World War I, capable of operating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> of <b>the</b> Royal Navy's aircraft carriers or as a floatplane. Only three were built, the Parnall Panther being preferred.|$|R
50|$|Much {{easier to}} operate from small decks than {{fixed-wing}} aircraft were ASW helicopters, which flew <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks</b> {{of nearly all}} allied conventional carriers to this day and most LPH or STOVL carriers operated by the Soviet, Spanish, Italian, Japanese, British, and Thai navies.|$|R
25|$|Since the {{starboard}} engine ran normally {{after it was}} decoupled from the reduction gear, a likely reason for the sudden drop of engine speed from 1,000 to 270 rpm and subsequent stalling when reconnected was increased load in the propulsion system due to damaged shaft bearing or a foreign object, perhaps something that had fallen <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck,</b> wedged in the propeller duct, although malfunction in the fuel supply and lubrication system due to the violent pitching of the vessel were not ruled out.|$|E
25|$|On 7 March {{they were}} sent inside the straits to bombard the forts. During this attack, Agamemnon {{was hit by a}} 14in shell, which {{penetrated}} the quarter deck, wrecked the ward room and the gun room below it, and sent splinters <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> armour into the maintop 100 yards above. Another shot sent splinters into the conning tower of Lord Nelson, wounding Captain McClintock in the head. During the attack Agamemnon was hit eight times by heavy shells and Lord Nelson seven times, but despite this only slight wounds were inflicted on the crew.|$|E
25|$|With the PAF in {{the east}} {{effectively}} neutralized, the IAF could now concentrate on supporting their advancing army. Movements of Pakistani troops during daytime came to a virtual halt due to relentless IAF air attacks. Ferries across major river crossings were sunk by the IAF, thus denying the Pakistani army its line of retreat to Dhaka. On 7 December, INS Vikrant, the Navy's sole aircraft carrier at the time, joined the operations. Sea Hawks, operating <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>deck</b> of Vikrant, struck Chittagong harbor, Cox's Bazaar, and Barisal. Whatever remained of the Pakistani Navy was destroyed or sunk, and the airfields in Cox's Bazaar, Chiringa, and Feni were made inoperative.|$|E
60|$|The {{weather was}} wild and {{threatening}} and the sailors predicted a great storm. Nevertheless the fleet put to sea and with reefed sails {{ran to the}} west. Their vessels were larger than the Danish galleys and could better keep the sea in a storm. Many miles were passed before, <b>from</b> <b>the</b> <b>decks,</b> <b>the</b> Danish flotilla could be seen. Presently, however, {{a great number of}} their galleys were discerned rowing in towards Swanage Bay.|$|R
50|$|When {{cards are}} {{exchanged}} between <b>the</b> two <b>decks,</b> <b>the</b> player must show the sensei cards to all opponents for confirmation, but need not show <b>the</b> cards removed <b>from</b> <b>the</b> life <b>deck.</b> <b>The</b> cards removed {{must be taken}} <b>from</b> <b>the</b> top of <b>the</b> life <b>deck,</b> then <b>the</b> sensei cards must be shuffled into <b>the</b> life <b>deck.</b> If <b>the</b> player fails to remove <b>the</b> sensei cards <b>from</b> <b>the</b> life <b>deck</b> before <b>the</b> subsequent game begins, that game is forfeited to the opponent.|$|R
