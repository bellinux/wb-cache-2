5|$|Though not a full cover, {{the song}} Oh! by Girls' Generation on their album Run Devil Run begins with long and {{recognizable}} {{section of the}} melody of Shut Up And Drive that is repeated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus.</b> The Girls' Generation version is faster (144 bpm) and higher (by 1 semitone).|$|E
5|$|Abbott asked Donen {{to appear}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> of his next Broadway show Best Foot Forward. He {{quickly became the}} show's {{assistant}} stage manager, and Kelly asked him to be his assistant choreographer. Eventually Donen was fired from Best Foot Forward, but in 1942 was the stage manager and assistant choreographer for Abbott's next show Beat the Band. In 1946, Donen briefly returned to Broadway to help choreograph dance numbers for Call Me Mister.|$|E
5|$|As {{the chorus}} progresses, Harket's voice hits ever higher notes, {{reaching}} a falsetto {{and hitting the}} song's highest note (E5, the dominant note) at the end. There is a temporary change of markings in the drum pattern <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus,</b> where for two bars the drums play in half time, returning to the same rhythm as before for {{the climax of the}} vocal line. A mix of a drum machine, the LinnDrum, acoustic guitars and electronic instrumentation serves as the song's backing track.|$|E
50|$|Michael McDonald can {{be heard}} {{providing}} multi-tracked backup vocals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choruses,</b> and keyboardist Paul Griffin can also be heard improvising background vocals <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>chorus</b> and fadeout.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1981, <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> under <b>the</b> {{direction}} of H. Kytasty toured Australia.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> December 1997, <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> became <b>the</b> first LGBT musical {{group to}} perform <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Philadelphia City Council {{chambers}} in City Hall, and PGMC's small ensemble, Brotherly Love, sang at {{the dedication of}} the William Way Community Center, <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> {{was one of the first}} tenants.|$|R
5|$|Fay Ripley (born 26 February 1966) is an English {{actress and}} recipe author. She is a {{graduate}} of the Guildhall School of Music and Drama (1990). Her first professional role was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> of a pantomime version of Around the World in 80 Days. Ripley's early film and television appearances were limited, so she supplemented her earnings by working as a children's entertainer and by selling menswear door-to-door. After her scenes as a prostitute were cut from Frankenstein (1994), Ripley gained her first major film role playing Karen Hughes in Mute Witness (1995).|$|E
5|$|In {{his first}} {{professional}} acting performance, Cagney danced costumed {{as a woman}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> line of the revue Every Sailor, in 1919. He spent several years in vaudeville as a dancer and comedian, until {{he got his first}} major acting part in 1925. He secured several other roles, receiving good notices, before landing the lead in the 1929 play Penny Arcade. After rave reviews, Warner Bros. signed him for an initial $500-a-week, three-week contract to reprise his role; this was quickly extended to a seven-year contract.|$|E
5|$|Jimmy Carter {{would later}} {{refer to the}} line in his presidential {{nomination}} speech at the 1976 Democratic National Convention, though it addresses matters of the self which supersede politics, in the process displaying certain themes associated with existentialism. Throughout the song, the words pour out quickly, with Dylan barely taking a breath between lines, so that the intricate rhyming structure is often missed: AAAAAB CCCCCB DDDDDB in the verses and AAB <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus.</b>|$|E
2500|$|Robertson had {{his single}} largest hit <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK with [...] "Somewhere Down The Crazy River", which {{features}} Robertson’s spoken word verses contrasted with singing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choruses.</b> <b>The</b> song reached #15 <b>in</b> <b>the</b> UK Hit Singles chart, and remained <b>in</b> <b>the</b> chart for 11 weeks. The video for [...] "Somewhere Down The Crazy River" [...] {{was directed by}} Martin Scorsese, and features Maria McKee in an acting role.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> September, <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> {{was invited}} to take part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> prestigious {{international}} music festival, Settembre Musica <b>in</b> Turin, Italy. <b>The</b> <b>Chorus,</b> still collaborating with Raymond Gubbay Ltd, sold out the Barbican Hall once again with their third Christmas show there (20 December). The show was hosted by Sandi Toksvig.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 2006, <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> hosted <b>the</b> NZABS {{national}} convention, and <b>in</b> 2012 hosted <b>the</b> Pan Pacific Competition.|$|R
5|$|Pinafore {{opened in}} New York on 1 December 1879 (with Gilbert onstage <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus)</b> {{and ran for}} the rest of December. After a {{reasonably}} strong first week, audiences quickly fell off, since most New Yorkers had already seen local productions of Pinafore. This was unexpected and forced Gilbert and Sullivan to race to complete and rehearse their new opera, The Pirates of Penzance, which premiered with much success on 31 December. Shortly thereafter, Carte sent three touring companies around the United States East Coast and Midwest, playing Pinafore alongside Pirates.|$|E
5|$|The Cagneys had run-of-the-play contracts, {{which lasted}} {{as long as}} the play did. Vernon was <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> line of the show, and with help from the Actors' Equity Association, Cagney understudied Tracy on the Broadway show, {{providing}} them with a desperately needed steady income. Cagney also established a dance school for professionals, then landed a part in the play Women Go On Forever, directed by John Cromwell, which ran for four months. By the end of the run, Cagney was exhausted from acting and running the dance school.|$|E
5|$|Under {{the name}} Lucille LeSueur, Crawford began {{dancing in the}} choruses of {{traveling}} revues and was spotted dancing in Detroit by producer Jacob J. Shubert. Shubert put her <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> line for his 1924 show, Innocent Eyes, at the Winter Garden Theatre on Broadway in New York City. While appearing in Innocent Eyes Crawford met a saxophone player named James Welton. The two were allegedly married in 1924 and lived together for several months, although this supposed marriage was never mentioned in later life by Crawford.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> recent years, <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> {{has made}} regular annual {{television}} appearances, including A Capitol Fourth during the 1812 Overture (Washington's annual Independence Day celebration), and the Kennedy Center Honors. <b>The</b> <b>chorus</b> has also occasionally appeared <b>in</b> <b>the</b> televised gala at Ford's Theatre. <b>In</b> 2000, <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> appeared <b>in</b> {{an episode of}} The West Wing involving a major character's recovery from music-induced post-traumatic stress disorder.|$|R
50|$|Coque {{was born}} in Ciudad de México to parents Marco Antonio Muñiz ("Mexico's Favorite Singer / Showman") and Olga Gardner Meza. When he was only 10 years old, he was singing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> of Armando Manzanero. His {{professional}} singing career began {{while he was still}} an adolescent.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1992 <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> {{performed}} for <b>the</b> {{first time at}} Leeds Castle under Carl Davis. This became an annual summer engagement for <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> which continued until 2007.|$|R
5|$|A sailor's {{work was}} {{hard in the}} days of sail. When off duty, many sailors played musical {{instruments}} or joined in unison to sing folksongs such as the mid-eighteenth century ballad The Mermaid, a song which expressed the sailors' superstition that seeing a mermaid foretold a shipwreck. When on duty, there were many repetitive tasks, such as turning the capstan to raise the anchor and heaving on ropes to raise and lower the sails. To synchronise the crew's efforts, sea shanties were sung, with a lead singer performing the verse and the sailors joining <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus.</b> In the Royal Navy in Nelson's time, these work songs were banned, being replaced by the notes of a fife or fiddle, or the recitation of numbers.|$|E
5|$|Calleia {{began his}} stage career on Armistice Day. After World War I he found only limited success in vaudeville. He earned his living stoking the furnace at a {{department}} store, {{and got a}} night job washing and repairing New York City streetcars. By day he haunted theatrical booking offices. The Henry W. Savage agency sent Calleia to Denver, where he made his stage debut singing <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> of the musical comedy, Have a Heart. The following season he had a bit part in Pietro (1920), an Otis Skinner vehicle that played six weeks on Broadway and 40 weeks on tour. Calleia supplemented his salary by working as assistant stage manager and repairing trunks at $3 each.|$|E
5|$|No {{national}} tour was attempted, {{but the show}} did have a six-week run at the Shubert Theatre in Chicago in spring 1954. Among those who played <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> during the New York run was future star Shirley MacLaine; Shirley Jones was a chorus girl in the Chicago performances. Subsequent productions include one by Kansas City's Starlight Theatre in 1955. Equity Library Theatre produced it in New York in 1970; it returned to that city, though not to Broadway, in 2002 with the York Theatre. A London production was presented by the Finborough Theatre in 2010 in a fifty-seat theatre; the production was billed as the show's European premiere.|$|E
50|$|<b>In</b> 1997, <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> {{produced}} {{its first}} commercial recording, The Spirit Says Sing. <b>In</b> April 2006, <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> produced a second recording, entitled Open Road, featuring the commissioned {{piece of the}} same title by composer Dr. Robert Maggio. December 2007 saw the release of Holiday Delights, PGMC's first collection of songs celebrating Christmas, Hanukkah, and Kwanzaa.|$|R
50|$|The Japanese {{version of}} the title song has {{the first and second}} verses <b>in</b> English and <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> and third verse <b>in</b> Japanese. <b>The</b> Korean version also has the first and second verses <b>in</b> English, but <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> and third verse are in Korean.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 2013, <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> competed at <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> {{competition}} at <b>the</b> Society's international convention in Toronto. Westminster placed second after a narrow two-point defeat by the Toronto Northern Lights.|$|R
5|$|The website Allmusic {{called the}} song 'a tormented ballad about romantic loss and regret {{built on a}} spooky yet heart-wrenching piano melody'. The torment {{is present in the}} song's opening ('There were nights when the wind was so cold'), from which the singer recovers ('I {{finished}} crying in the instant that you left... And I banished every memory you and I had ever made'). However, the defiance in the verses are replaced by the return of the 'subservient' feelings <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> ('when you touch me like this, and you hold me like that...'); this juxtaposition continues throughout the song.|$|E
5|$|Around {{this time}} Henry Tippett decided {{to live in}} France, and the house in Wetherden was sold. The 15-year-old Michael and his brother Peter {{remained}} at school in England, travelling to France for their holidays. Michael found Stamford much more congenial than Fettes, and developed both academically and musically. He found an inspiring piano teacher in Frances Tinkler, who {{introduced him to the}} music of Bach, Beethoven, Schubert and Chopin. Sargent had maintained his connection with the school, and was present when Tippett and another boy played a C minor Concerto for Two Harpsichords by Bach on pianos with a local string orchestra. Tippett sang <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> when Sargent directed a local performance of Robert Planquette's operetta Les Cloches de Corneville. Despite his parents' wish that he follow an orthodox path by proceeding to Cambridge University, Tippett had firmly decided on a career as a composer, a prospect that alarmed them and was discouraged by his headmaster and by Sargent.|$|E
5|$|He {{began his}} career <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> line on Broadway for {{director}} George Abbott, where he befriended Kelly. In 1943 he went to Hollywood {{and worked as a}} choreographer before he and Kelly made On the Town in 1949. He then worked as a contract director for MGM under producer Arthur Freed producing hit films amid critical acclaim, both as a solo director and with Kelly. In 1952 Donen and Kelly co-directed the musical Singin' in the Rain, {{regarded as one of the}} greatest films ever made. Donen's relationship with Kelly deteriorated in 1955 during their final collaboration on It's Always Fair Weather. He then broke his contract with MGM to become an independent producer in 1957. As musicals began to lose public appeal, Donen switched to comedies. He continued to make hit films until the late 1960s, after which his career slowed down. He briefly returned to the stage as a director in the 1990s and again in 2002.|$|E
50|$|Mollie King {{opens the}} song and sings the first verse, the first bridge and a backing vocal during the second bridge. Una Healy sings backing vocals during the first bridge and adlibs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>chorus.</b> Vanessa White sings the second verse, leads <b>the</b> <b>chorus,</b> adlibs on <b>the</b> final <b>chorus</b> and closes <b>the</b> song. Frankie Sandford sings the second bridge and small adlib between <b>the</b> final <b>chorus</b> and <b>the</b> end of the song. Rochelle Wiseman sings the third bridge and does adlibs <b>in</b> <b>the</b> final <b>chorus.</b>|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> June 2014, <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> {{returned}} to London {{once more to}} perform with the London Gay Men's <b>Chorus.</b> <b>The</b> performance was at the Southbank Centre, Queen Elizabeth Hall. While <b>in</b> London, <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> also performed at the US Embassy at a reception hosted by US Ambassador Matthew W. Barzun. After its performance <b>in</b> London, <b>the</b> <b>Chorus</b> traveled to Dublin, Ireland, to take part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> European LGBT Choral Festival, Various Voices. <b>The</b> <b>Chorus</b> took part on the Festival stage and also performed at <b>the</b> US Embassy <b>in</b> Dublin. <b>The</b> Bord Gáis Energy Theatre was the site for a special performance of Big Gay Sing: Club Night Out as a benefit performance {{to raise funds for}} the Marriage Equality drive in Ireland. A check for €30,000 was presented to Marriage Equality in Ireland.|$|R
50|$|<b>In</b> 1976 <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> began a long {{association}} with the conductor Antal Doráti, under whose baton <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> performed <b>in</b> 18 concerts, mostly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> Royal Festival Hall, and made 5 recordings.|$|R
25|$|In either 1881 or 1882 {{he joined}} the D'Oyly Carte Opera Company as a chorus member. In early 1882, he {{appeared}} on tour <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> of Claude Duval and, later in the same year, <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> of H.M.S. Pinafore and The Pirates of Penzance. He was promoted to the roles of Dick Deadeye in Pinafore and Samuel in Pirates in August 1882. He also appeared as Mr. Wallaby in the companion piece Quite an Adventure. In November 1882, he created the role of Private Willis in Iolanthe at the Savoy Theatre.|$|E
25|$|The town of Fougères is {{mentioned}} <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> {{of the song}} , by Gilles Servat. The author uses it {{as a symbol of}} the Breton resistance where it is adjacent to the town of Clisson in the Loire-Atlantique.|$|E
25|$|Lima in {{the early}} twentieth century was filled with musical theatre and many well known musicians made their home in Lima. Alomía Robles {{discovered}} that the theatre needed extras <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>chorus</b> line and offered himself so he could hear the music for free and learn the operettas of that period.|$|E
50|$|He {{possessed a}} natural alto voice, {{and in a}} trial of William Crotch's oratorio Palestine he played the double-bass and sang <b>the</b> alto part <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choruses</b> at <b>the</b> same time. He was also a {{performer}} on the trumpet. He died of apoplexy at Cople vicarage on 12 January 1875, aged 54.|$|R
50|$|The album {{sleeve and}} other sources {{indicate}} that Ringo Starr played Hammond organ on this track, an unusual instrument for the Beatle drummer. Mark Lewisohn reported {{that he could not}} hear the organ and that Hammond organ was not listed on the session tape box. Starr plays quick two-note vamps <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choruses.</b>|$|R
2500|$|Mercury {{commented that}} he wrote the lyrics before the melody and music, whereas he would {{typically}} do the opposite. The recording features elaborate four-part harmonies (particularly <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>choruses,</b> and also providing backing parts <b>in</b> <b>the</b> verses), and also a multitracked guitar solo by Brian May which makes use of the [...] "bell effect".|$|R
