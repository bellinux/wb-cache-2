5000|$|At the {{beginning}} of the project, the task force reached out to transformer manufacturers in an effort to build consensus for standardizing a design. NEMA hired the Agnew Moyer Smith company of Pittsburgh, PA to design the label, and the George R. Fraich Associates Testing Organization of Chicago to test children's reactions to it. NEMA began testing the first iterations of the design in late 1981, initially choosing sixteen different illustrations to test on children. The test groups were located in Chicago, IL and San Antonio, Texas, and consisted of an equal number of English and non-English-speaking children, aged 2.5 to 6 years old. From that group of sixteen illustrations, NEMA selected the four most successful designs and conducted a second round of user tests in early 1982, using a group of children located in Chicago and identical in age range and language. Of those four illustrations, the one children most strongly associated with danger was Mr. Ouch. A 1995 study {{presented at the annual meeting}} of the Human Factors and Ergonomics Society confirmed that Mr. Ouch most effectively suggested an <b>electrical</b> <b>hazard,</b> out of four other symbols.|$|E

Angie is applauded for quickly organizing her room (she credits it to her maternal instincts due to being a mother of four). Brian M apologizes for damaging his door, while Eric is led into his former room, as he had damaged the radiator in Angie's bathroom, which would have caused a lethal <b>electrical</b> <b>hazard</b> were the power connected, causing Geoff to nominate him as the episode's worst. However, Gail and Andrew decide that the worst in the episode is Brian P: before the first challenge, Brian P had demolished his bathroom sink to get a head start on the next episode's demolition challenge, but had caused a water leak that is starting to drip into the common area on the floor below (Gail also notes that he had not attempted to use any of his new tools, relying on what he knew coming into rehab).|$|E

It was concluded that the <b>electrical</b> <b>hazard</b> from carbon fibers accidentally released in an aircraft crash fire pose no threat to human life. Overall costs associated with carbon fiber release are predicted to be extremely low. The risk of electrical or electronic failures due to carbon fibers is so minimal that future exploitation of carbon composites in aircraft should be continued. Additional protection of aircraft avionics to guard against carbon fibers is unnecessary.

40|$|The Standard for Electrical Safety in the Workplace, NFPA 70 E, and {{relevant}} OSHA electrical safety standards evolved {{to address the}} hazards of 60 -Hz power that are faced primarily by electricians, linemen, and others performing facility and utility work. This leaves a substantial gap {{in the management of}} electrical hazards in Research and Development (R&D) and specialized high voltage and high power equipment. Examples include lasers, accelerators, capacitor banks, electroplating systems, induction and dielectric heating systems, etc. Although all such systems are fed by 50 / 60 Hz alternating current (ac) power, we find substantial use of direct current (dc) electrical energy, and the use of capacitors, inductors, batteries, and radiofrequency (RF) power. The electrical hazards of these forms of electricity and their systems are different than for 50160 Hz power. Over the past 10 years there has been an effort to develop a method of classifying all of the electrical hazards found in all types of R&D and utilization equipment. Examples of the variation of these hazards from NFPA 70 E include (a) high voltage can be harmless, if the available current is sufficiently low, (b) low voltage can be harmful if the available current/power is high, (c) high voltage capacitor hazards are unique and include severe reflex action, affects on the heart, and tissue damage, and (d) arc flash hazard analysis for dc and capacitor systems are not provided in existing standards. This work has led to a comprehensive <b>electrical</b> <b>hazard</b> classification system that is based on various research conducted over the past 100 years, on analysis of such systems in R&D, and on decades of experience. Initially, national electrical safety codes required the qualified worker only to know the source voltage to determine the shock hazard. Later, as arc flash hazards were understood, the fault current and clearing time were needed. These items are still insufficient to fully characterize all types of electrical hazards. The new comprehensive <b>electrical</b> <b>hazard</b> classification system uses a combination of voltage, shock current available, fault current available, power, energy, and waveform to classify all forms of electrical hazards. Based on this <b>electrical</b> <b>hazard</b> classification system, many new tools have been developed, including (a) work controls for these hazards, (b) better selection of PPE for R&D work, (c) improved training, and (d) a new Severity Ranking Tool that is used to rank electrical accidents and incidents with various forms of electrical energy...|$|E

A preliminary evaluation of the relationship between displacement and flow rate is theoretically and experimentally conducted, as well as a measurement range up to 3. 00 • 10 - 4 m 3 /s (18. 0 l/min) has been verified, in accordance to the flow range usual for tidal breathing of infants...|$|E
40|$|Carbon {{filaments}} disseminated {{into the}} environment by combustion of carbon fiber/resin composites threaten electrical and electronic equipment, including power distribution and communications systems.

The <b>electrical</b> <b>hazard</b> is mitigated by combustion promotors, and several substances have been evaluated in this role.

This method may also reduce the <b>electrical</b> <b>hazard</b> in a larger battery system since, by stopping the air supply, the voltage can be brought to zero while maintaining the energy capacity of the battery. Measurements of overdischarge currents and current cut-off by suffocation have been performed to assess the safety of this type of Zn–air battery.
