[...] Low molecular weight antioxidants, molecules that prevent other molecules from being oxidized by acting as reducing agents, are important in living cells because they inhibit cell damage or death caused by oxidation reactions that produce radicals. [...] Examples of antioxidants include flavonoids, whose antioxidant activity is greatly increased with more hydroxyl groups. [...] Because traditional methods {{to determine}} antioxidant capacity involve tedious steps, techniques to increase the rate of the experiment are continually being researched. One such technique involves cyclic voltammetry because it can measure the antioxidant capacity by quickly measuring the redox behavior over a complex system without the need to measure each component’s antioxidant capacity. [...] Furthermore, antioxidants are quickly oxidized at inert electrodes, so the <b>half-wave</b> <b>potential</b> can be utilized to determine antioxidant capacity. [...] It {{is important to note that}} whenever cyclic voltammetry is utilized, it is usually compared to spectrophotometry or High Performance Liquid Chromotography (HPLC).
