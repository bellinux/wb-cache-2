This final project {{report was}} written {{based on the}} job {{training}} at C. V Haryan Handicrafts Surakarta, during June 15, 2015 until July 11, 2015. The objectives of this final project are to describe the <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> at C. V Haryan Handicrafts Surakarta and to identify the problems and solutions of exporting procedure at C. V Haryan Handicrafts Surakarta. The <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> consists of some stages: hunting buyer, opening Letter of Credit (L/C), batik payment and production, clearance, and shipping. Hunting buyer is a process to look for the buyer candidates and promote their batik products to the buyer candidates through internet. Opening Letter of Credit (L/C) is a process to make written treaty through banks. Batik payment and production is a process when the buyer pays the good while the exporter produces the goods. Managing shipment documents is a process to prepare the shipment documents. Finally, shipping is a process to shipping the goods to the buyer using ship or airplane. There are some problems of the <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> CV Haryan Handicrafts Surakarta; the batik design, the cost, and delivery time. The batik design is complicated enough and the employees have to be careful to make the batik products. The batik price is unstable and it can be caused by cost of the materials. Therefore, CV Haryan Handicrafts Surakarta has to discuss about the cost agreement with the buyer. Delivery time can be influenced by the problems of batik production which causes the delivery time become late. Therefore, CV Haryan Handicrafts Surakarta should discuss with the buyer to ask tolerance...|$|E
40|$|Researchers {{typically}} spend {{significant amounts}} of time cleaning and labeling data files in preparation of analyses of survey data. Computer-assisted personal interviewing (CAPI) gives the ability to automate this process. First, consistency checks can be run during the interview so that only data that passes autogenerated and user-written validation tests comes back from the field. Second, CAPI allows for the autogeneration of a Stata do-file that labels data files. This presentation discusses the Stata <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> used by surveybe, a CAPI application designed to handle complex surveys. The questions, as displayed on the screen to the interviewer, are automatically turned into variable labels. Likewise, the drop-down menus are autocoded as value labels. Furthermore, the <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> ensures that data from rosters get exported into different Stata data files and that complete referential integrity is ensured across all the files originating from the same survey, with unique primary keys linking files together. Any changes made to the electronic questionnaire (for example, adding a response code to the drop-down menu) or changes to the phrasing of a question will be automatically incorporated into the exported data files, thus ensuring that the data files match the questionnaires completely. ...|$|E

Then, a special program-converter reads the file, generates a beam frame model and stores the information in a new format, which {{is compatible with the}} program of structural analysis earlier developed by the authors. This program allows to add both vertical or horizontal loads and moment to any of the beam frame nodes. The finite element method is used for structural analysis.

40|$|AbstractWe {{describe}} {{an extension of}} P systems where each membrane has an associated control nucleus responsible with the generation of the {{rules to be applied}} in that membrane. The nucleus exports a set of rules which are applied in the membrane region (only for one step, but in the usual maximal-parallel way), then the rules are removed and a new iteration of this process takes place. This way, powerful control mechanisms may be included in P systems themselves, as opposed to using the level of “strategies” previously exploited for simulating P systems. The nuclei may contain general programs for generating rules, ranging from those using information on the full system, to more restricted programs where only local information in the nuclei themselves and the associated membranes is used. The latter approach, mixed with a particular mechanism for the representation of the control programs, the rules, and the <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> is powerful enough for modeling complex biological applications, e. g., to develop a detailed model for cell growth and division in normal and abnormal (tumoral) evolution of biological systems...|$|E

Cambodia Trade Integration Study (CTIS) (MoC 2014) has acknowledged that to enhance benefits of current agricultural products, aiming at increased flow of agricultural exports through formal channel, priorities should be given to two avenues: undertaking some degree of processing inside the country, and increasing direct export to final markets. These should require mechanism to execute government’s strategy effectively. Reduction of informal domestic payments during transport and <b>export</b> <b>procedure</b> should also be deemed vital. Moreover, although with increasing values, agriculture has experienced slower growth in the last few years, explained by depressed agricultural commodity price and slow yield improvements after 2013 (World Bank 2015). Rice production and yield of the wet season decreased by 2.5 and 3 %, respectively, in 2014 from the past year. While production growth had depended to a large extent on cultivated area expansion, current land constraints have become a concern.

The internship was designed to provide the real life job experience and the later part was fully focused on the job description. The project of the report has been prepared to understand the overall export operation and financing (export bill purchase) of the bank. However, a critical analysis has also been done to show the performance of the bank comparing with other banks and also with its own branches.

In this paper, we describe a further extension of P-systems, briefly mentioned in [4], obtained by integrating powerful mechanisms (called “control nuclei”) to control the activity in P-systems. With these two extensions, we foreseen the development of a high level modeling and programming language on top of P-systems, powerful enough to simulate the behavior of complex, real biological systems. A P-system with control nuclei (PCN for short) is a P-system [2] where each membrane has an associated nucleus with a program for generating the rules to be used within the membrane region. The semantics of a PCN is simple: repeatedly, at each running step, a set of rules is generated by the nucleus program in each membrane and the usual maximal-parallel rule for P-systems is applied (for one step, only). 562 Gh.
