They are sometimes considered alternative or even contradictory conceptual frameworks. Here, we seek to deploy them as complementary ways of making sense of the complexities of healthcare organisation today. We focus on efforts to improve quality and safety in three UK hospitals. We find a prominent role for <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power,</b> including a panoptic gaze that is to some extent internalised by professionals. We suggest, however, that the role of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> relies for its impact on complementary strategies that are more akin to governmentality. These strategies foster organisational contexts that are receptive to disciplinary work. More fundamentally, we find that both <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> and governmentality work on subjectivities in rather a different manner from that suggested by conventional accounts. We offer an alternative, less individualised and more socialised, understanding {{of the way in which}} power acts upon subjectivity and behaviour in professional contexts.

With support from the anticlerical National Liberal Party, which had become Bismarck's chief ally in the Reichstag, he abolished the Catholic Department of the Prussian Ministry of Culture. That left the Catholics without a voice in high circles. Moreover, in 1872, the Jesuits were expelled from Germany. More anti-Catholic laws of 1873 allowed the Prussian government to supervise the education of the Roman Catholic clergy and curtailed the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>powers</b> of the Church.

40|$|Purpose – The aim of {{this study}} is to examine how the use of {{indirect}} government control mechanisms is used as a means of holding government agencies such as job network providers and recipients of social security benefits accountable. The mechanisms of indirect government will be examined using Michel Foucault's discourses on <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power,</b> surveillance and normalisation. Design/methodology/approach – The mechanisms of indirect government are investigated through a survey questionnaire and focus group interviews. The questionnaire is assessed and analysed using descriptive statistics and principal component analysis with varimax rotation. Findings – It is found that the rationing and disciplinary mechanisms of the breaching regime, through a process of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power,</b> surveillance and normalisation, combine to help hold government agencies and recipients of social security benefits accountable, which in turn helps control the level of social security expenditure. Originality/value – The current study extends our understanding of the functions of indirect government by providing an applied example of how the process of government works indirectly through government agencies and the abundant rules and regulations that underpin such bureaucracies.

40|$|The Author(s) 2015. This study {{examines}} {{the use of}} interest rate swaps by Italian municipalities during the 2000 - 2014 period. Through a constructive critique of Foucauldian political economy, it argues that local administrators did not enter the swaps market to perform and depoliticize the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> of financialized discourses. The evidence suggests many more layers of historical complexity underlie the municipalities' actions than a Foucauldian approach can grasp. Local governments used swaps to circumvent the budget constraints imposed by the European Stability and Growth Pact. In this sense, municipalities acted more for political-strategic than for performative and depoliticized purposes. Rethinking the dimensions of performativity and <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> - through an approach that is more sensitive than Foucauldian analysis to historical agency and asymmetrical power relations - is crucial to address the differential and politically shaped contours of financialization across the globe...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (Ph. D.) [...] University of Washington, 2000 In this dissertation, I {{illustrate}} how <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> techniques {{are being used}} today to extend and solidify state control over forest understory products located on national forest lands in the Pacific Northwest. The spring wild mushroom harvest on the Sisters Ranger District in central Oregon serves {{as a case study}} for exploring this topic. I used a political ecology framework to analyze wild mushroom politics at Sisters. I relied upon ethnographic methods, including participant observation, semi-structured interviews, and archival analysis, to gather data. My work indicates that the Sisters Ranger District is using five elements of <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> noted by Foucault in efforts to solidify control over the activities of commercial wild mushroom harvesters. The elements in use include: (1) categorization of pickers; (2) separation of commercial pickers from other forest users; (3) development of a documenting apparatus {{in the form of a}} variety of permit requirements; (4) creation of a wild mushroom "panopticon" in the form of a heavily monitored wild mushroom buying camp; and (5) a movement toward professionalization of the knowledge accepted as valid within the forest management decision-making process. The application of these <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> techniques has created considerable tension between wild mushroom pickers and buyers and the Forest Service. These tensions revolve in part around the Forest Service's failure to include pickers and buyers in key decisions affecting their lives, such as the establishment and siting of an industrial wild mushroom camp. The disciplinary apparatus also works by fixing people in place and time in order to facilitate monitoring and tracking of activities and individuals. Yet mobility and flexibility constitute the very core of pickers and buyers lives. Lastly, the <b>disciplinary</b> <b>power</b> apparatus has transformed what were once picker living spaces into industrial work places. Much of the current resistance to the Forest Service's wild mushroom policies stem from pickers and buyers' feelings of having lost control, not just over their work, but over their lives...|$|R

It asks: What does it mean and do to speak of affective acts as acts of affective citizenship? I argue that the phrase ‘affective citizenship’ attaches affect to a very specific object: citizenship. Studying affective citizenship requires attention to how some feelings attach themselves to citizenship and to how citizenship itself can evoke certain feelings. But affective citizenship does not occur ‘naturally’: it arises from, requires and/or produces knowledge, labour, and (new) ‘feeling rules’ (Hochschild in de Wilde and Duyvendak).
