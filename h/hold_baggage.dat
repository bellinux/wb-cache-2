25|$|EasyJet, like Ryanair, uses a {{business}} model pioneered by Southwest Airlines. Both airlines have adapted this {{model for the}} European market through further cost-cutting measures, such as not selling connecting flights or providing complimentary snacks on board. The key points of this business model are high aircraft utilisation, quick turnaround times, charging for extras (such as priority boarding, <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> and food) and keeping operating costs low. One main difference easyJet and Ryanair have from Southwest is they both fly a young fleet of aircraft. Southwest has an average fleet age of 11.9 years whereas Ryanair's and easyJet's average fleet ages are just a little over six years each.|$|E

50|$|On {{the morning}} of 5 November Air France-KLM {{announced}} that it would not allow <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> on its flight out from Cairo that day; over half of the booked passengers refused to fly. There were an estimated 20,000 British citizens in Sharm El Sheikh on 5 November, almost half of whom were on holiday and stranded by the cancellation of flights. Flights to the UK were allowed again from 6 November, to enable people to travel home, but with restrictions and increased security measures. Passengers were permitted to travel home with only hand luggage, with hold luggage to be returned following a more stringent screening process. British officials at the airport provided extra security and approved aircraft as safe to travel.|$|E
5000|$|Prohibition on the {{transport}} of dogs and cats in the passenger cabin, or as baggage - British law precludes all animals entering the UK either in the cabin or in the hold as 'excess' or 'checked' baggage. Unlike the UK, most western countries do allow airlines to carry dogs/cats on flights provided that specific requirements are met regarding the container the pet will travel in. All animals (except guide dogs) travelling to the UK must travel in the hold as manifest cargo. Most airlines do not offer cargo services to individual passengers directly and specialist agents must be used. UK law does not prohibit {{the transport}} of dogs and cats in the cabin or as <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> when departing from the UK, but restrictions may be imposed by individual airlines or destination countries. See Other useful information below for further travel details.|$|E

50|$|Production of the Tu-110 was {{authorised}} at the Kazan Aircraft Factory, with {{an initial}} order for ten aircraft, but only three aircraft were completed before the programme was terminated. The production aircraft featured extended-chord wings and enlarged <b>baggage</b> <b>holds,</b> as well as seating for up to 100 passengers in an all-tourist class seating arrangement.|$|R
50|$|From 2011, KLM {{committed}} to blocking middle seats on its short haul fleet so that business class passengers {{would always have}} an empty seat next to them for extra comfort. This means that Seats C and E on any business class row on the Fokker fleet are no longer used, and a maximum of three passengers are seated on each row - reducing the maximum capacity of the Fokker 70 on scheduled services to 78 passengers. Seat blocking is not done on the Embraer 190 or E175 fleet which only has four-abreast seating. From 22 April 2013 KLM began charging for <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> on all European flights (including all KLM Cityhopper services) unless passengers are on a Business Class ticket or an Elite tier member of the 'Flying Blue' frequent flyer program. The baggage fee will also be waived if the KLM Cityhopper flight is just one leg of an intercontinental trip.|$|E
40|$|For years, {{terrorist}} attacks have presented a constant threat to civil aviation and highlighted {{the importance of}} aviation security. Threats that have reached new dimensions demand a reliable security check, not only for <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> but also for passengers and their carry-on baggage. For example, the terror attack on September 11, 2001, has revealed a new dimension. Former terror attacks were comparable to Lockerbie 1988, when Pan Am Flight 103 was destroyed by a bomb in the <b>hold</b> <b>baggage.</b> As a result, immediate changes regarding <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> screening were introduced, and automated systems for detecting improvised explosive devices (IEDs) in <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> were developed. However, in the recent past, suicide bombings have become more likely, and therefore enhanced security checks of passengers and their carry-on bags have become necessary. Although new state-of-the-art technology, such as automatic liquid detectors, millimeter wave systems, X-ray machines with automatic detection of explosive materials, and so forth, facilitate the detection of threat items, the final decision is still made by human operators (screeners). It {{has been argued that}} with advances in technology, the cognitive demands on humans are increased rather than lowered. ...|$|E
40|$|This study {{describes}} a cost-effective check-in baggage screening system, based on "on-belt tomosynthesis" (ObT) and close-range photogrammetry, {{that is designed}} to address the limitations of the most common system used, conventional projection radiography. The latter's limitations can lead to loss of information and an increase in baggage handling time, as baggage is manually searched or screened with more advanced systems. This project proposes a system that overcomes such limitations creating a cost-effective automated pseudo- 3 D imaging system, by combining x-ray and optical imaging to form digital tomograms. Tomographic reconstruction requires a knowledge of the change in geometry between multiple x-ray views of a common object. This is uniquely achieved using a close range photogrammetric system based on a small network of web-cameras. This paper presents the recent developments of the ObT system and describes recent findings of the photogrammetric system implementation. Based on these positive results, future work on the advancement of the ObT system as a cost-effective pseudo- 3 D imaging of <b>hold</b> <b>baggage</b> for airport security is proposed...|$|E
5000|$|The {{original}} station, {{which opened}} in 1885, was located across from Bến Thành Market in District 1.

The station is situated around 1 km from the downtown city centre.|$|R
50|$|The two L-1011 {{aircraft}} {{delivered to}} Pacific Southwest Airlines were configured with internal airstair doors that led into an entry hall {{in what was}} normally the forward lower <b>baggage</b> <b>hold.</b> This was to allow operations from airfields {{that did not have}} terminal buildings with jet bridges. These two aircraft were later in service with Aeroperú and Worldways Canada.|$|R
50|$|There {{were four}} or five divided {{fuselage}} sections, the latter holding the maximum of 40 passengers. There were toilets, a cloakroom and a mail store aft, and a <b>baggage</b> <b>hold</b> forward of the passenger space.

5000|$|Passenger {{aircraft}} use {{the spare}} volume in the airplane's <b>baggage</b> <b>hold</b> (the [...] "belly") {{that is not}} being used for passenger luggage - a common practice used by passenger airlines, who additionally transport cargo on scheduled passenger flights. - this practice is known as Belly Cargo. Cargo can also be transported in the passenger cabin as hand-carry by an “on-board courier”.|$|R
50|$|The {{aircraft}} could transport 72 {{passengers in}} a great comfort. On the lower level there was a salon with 20 armchairs and tables, six deluxe double cabins, {{each with its own}} bathroom, seating for a further 22 passengers, a kitchen, a bar and a <b>baggage</b> <b>hold.</b> The upper level had seating for 18 passengers, a storage compartment and an office for the three flight engineers.|$|R
50|$|On {{the night}} of October 10, 1933 a United Boeing 247 {{exploded}} in mid-air and crashed near Chesterton, Indiana, killing the seven people aboard. Investigation revealed that the explosion {{was caused by a}} nitroglycerin bomb placed in the <b>baggage</b> <b>hold.</b> The United Airlines Chesterton Crash {{is believed to be the}} first proven case of air sabotage in commercial aviation history.

5000|$|It {{has proven}} {{advantageous}} {{in the air}} cargo industry in which freight is carried in the unused <b>baggage</b> <b>hold</b> space on passenger flights ("belly cargo"). Traditionally, large cargo aircraft are scheduled to fly between large hubs so freight often has be forwarded on by additional flights or by rail or road. Belly cargo carried point to point can be delivered closer to its final destination.|$|R
