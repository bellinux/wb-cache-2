25|$|The Job Characteristics Approach to <b>job</b> <b>design</b> {{is based}} on how core {{dimensions}} affect motivation. These dimensions include autonomy, variety, significance, feedback, and identity. The goal of JCT <b>job</b> <b>design</b> is to utilize specific interventions {{in an effort to}} enhance these core dimensions.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the most}} recent {{approaches}} to work design, the Interdisciplinary Approach is based on the use of careful assessment of current <b>job</b> <b>design,</b> followed by a cost/benefit analysis, and finally changes based on the area in which a job is lacking. The assessment is conducted using the Multi-method <b>Job</b> <b>Design</b> Questionnaire, which is used to determine if the job is deficient in the areas of motivational, mechanistic, biological, or perceptual motor support. Motivational improvements are aligned with the Job Characteristics theory dimensions. Mechanistic improvements are focused on improving the efficiency of the <b>job</b> <b>design.</b> Biological improvements focus on improvements to ergonomics, health conditions, and employee comfort. Finally, perceptual motor improvements focus on the nature and presentation of the information an employee must work with. If improvements are identified using the questionnaire, the company then evaluates the cost of making the improvements and determines if the potential gains in motivation and performance justify those costs. Because of the analysis and cost/benefit components of the Interdisciplinary Approach, it is often less costly for organizations and implementations can be more effective. Only changes deemed to be appropriate investments are made, thus improving motivation, productivity, and job satisfaction while controlling costs.|$|E
25|$|Reward-based {{systems are}} {{certainly}} {{the more common}} practice for attempting to influence motivation within an organization, but some employers strive to design the work itself to be more conducive. There are multiple ways an organization can leverage <b>job</b> <b>design</b> principles to increase motivation. Three of the predominant approaches will be discussed here: the Humanistic Approach, the Job Characteristics Approach, and the Interdisciplinary Approach.|$|E

25|$|While the JCT {{approach}} to <b>job</b> <b>design</b> {{has a significant}} impact on job satisfaction, the effects on performance are more mixed. Much of the success of implementation of JCT practices is dependent on the organization carefully planning interventions and changes to ensure impact throughout the organization is anticipated. Many companies may have difficulty implementing JCT changes throughout the organization due to its high cost and complexity.|$|E

2500|$|The Humanistic Approach to <b>job</b> <b>design</b> was a {{reaction}} to [...] "worker dissatisfaction over Scientific Management" [...] and focused on providing employees with more input {{and an opportunity to}} maximize their personal achievement as referenced by Jex and Britt. Jobs should also provide intellectual stimulation, opportunities for creativity, and greater discretion over work-related activities. Two approaches used in the Humanistic Approach to <b>job</b> <b>design</b> are job rotation and job enrichment. Job rotation allows employees to switch to different jobs which allows them to learn new skills and provides them with greater variety. According to Jex and Britt, this would be most effective for simple jobs that can become mundane and boring over time. Job enrichment is focused on leveraging those aspects of jobs that are labeled motivators, such as control, intellectual challenge, and creativity. The most common form of job enrichment is vertical loading where additional tasks or discretion enhances the initial <b>job</b> <b>design.</b> While there is some evidence to support that job enrichment improves motivation, {{it is important to note}} that it is not effective for all people. Some employees are not more motivated by enriched jobs.|$|E
2500|$|Shortly after Herzberg's Two-factor theory, Hackman and Oldham contributed their own, more refined, job-based theory; Job {{characteristic}} theory (JCT). JCT {{attempts to}} define the association between core job dimensions, the critical psychological states that occur {{as a result of}} these dimensions, the personal and work outcomes, and growth-need strength. Core job dimensions are the characteristics of a person's job. The core job dimensions are linked directly to the critical psychological states.
