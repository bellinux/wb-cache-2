40|$|The enemy-release {{hypothesis}} (ERH) {{states that}} species become {{more successful in}} their introduced range than <b>in</b> their <b>native</b> range because they leave behind natural enemies <b>in</b> their <b>native</b> range and are thus "released" from enemy pressures in their introduced range. The ERH is popularly cited to explain the invasive properties of many species and is the underpinning of biological control. We tested the prediction that plant populations are more strongly regulated by natural enemies (herbivores and pathogens) <b>in</b> their <b>native</b> range than <b>in</b> their introduced range with enemy-removal experiments using pesticides. These experiments were replicated at multiple sites <b>in</b> both the <b>native</b> and invaded ranges of the grass Brachypodium sylvaticum. In support of the ERH, enemies consistently regulated populations <b>in</b> the <b>native</b> range. There were more tillers and more seeds produced in treated vs. untreated plots <b>in</b> the <b>native</b> range, and few seedlings survived <b>in</b> the <b>native</b> range. Contrary to the ERH, total measured leaf damage was similar in both ranges, though the enemies that caused it differed. There was more damage by generalist mollusks and pathogens <b>in</b> the <b>native</b> range, and more damage by generalist insect herbivores in the invaded range. Demographic analysis showed that population growth rates were lower <b>in</b> the <b>native</b> range than <b>in</b> the invaded range, and that sexually produced seedlings constituted a smaller {{fraction of the total}} <b>in</b> the <b>native</b> range. Our removal experiment showed that enemies regulate plant populations <b>in</b> their <b>native</b> range and suggest that generalist enemies, not just specialists, are important for population regulation...|$|R

5|$|Condor bones {{have been}} found <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> American graves, as have condor feather headdresses. Cave {{paintings}} of condors have also been discovered. Some tribes ritually killed condors to make ceremonial clothing out of their feathers. Shamans then danced while wearing these to reach {{the upper and lower}} spiritual worlds. Whenever a shaman died, his clothes were said to be cursed, so new clothing had to be made for his successor. Some scientists, such as Noel Snyder, believe that this process of making ceremonial clothing contributed to the condor's decline.|$|E
5|$|Doro {{started her}} career in garage bands <b>in</b> <b>native</b> Düsseldorf {{underground}} scene and achieved media visibility and some commercial success with Warlock in the 1980s.

She started a solo career under the name Doro, in order to avoid legal battles between her record label PolyGram and her former manager. She released two albums in the US with producers Joey Balin and Gene Simmons, but they were not the breakthrough that she hoped.|$|E
5|$|Free cobalt (the native metal) is {{not found}} on Earth because of {{oxygen in the}} {{atmosphere}} and chlorine in the ocean. Oxygen and chlorine are abundant enough in the upper layers of the Earth's crust to prevent the formation of native metal cobalt.

Though the element is of medium abundance, natural compounds of cobalt are numerous. Small amounts of cobalt compounds are found in most rocks, soil, plants, and animals.|$|E

5|$|<b>In</b> <b>Native</b> American mythology, the bobcat {{is often}} twinned with {{the figure of}} the coyote in a theme of duality. Lynx and coyote are {{associated}} with the fog and wind, respectively—two elements representing opposites <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> American folklore. This basic story, in many variations, is found in the native cultures of North America (with parallels in South America), but they diverge in the telling. One version, which appears in the Nez Perce folklore for instance, depicts lynx and coyote as opposed, antithetical beings. However, another version depicts them with equality and identicality. Claude Lévi-Strauss argues the former concept, that of twins representing opposites, is an inherent theme in New World mythologies, but they are not equally balanced figures, representing an open-ended dualism rather than the symmetric duality of Old World cultures. The latter notion then, Lévi-Strauss suggests, is the result of regular contact between Europeans and native cultures. Additionally, the version found in the Nez Perce story is of much greater complexity, while the version of equality seems to have lost the tale's original meaning.|$|E

Grasshoppers are served on skewers in some Chinese food markets, like the Donghuamen Night Market. Fried grasshoppers (walang goreng) are eaten in the Gunung Kidul Regency, Yogyakarta, Java in Indonesia. <b>In</b> <b>Native</b> America, the Ohlone people burned grassland to herd grasshoppers into pits where they could be collected as food.|$|E
5|$|Menominee Tribe v. United States is a {{landmark}} case <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> American law, {{primarily in the}} area of reserved tribal rights. It has been used in college courses to explain tribal sovereignty rights and that tribes retain some rights even if the tribe has been terminated, as the Menominee tribe was. The decision in the case has affected subsequent legislation, such as the Alaska Native Claims Settlement Act, in which Congress expressly extinguished all aboriginal rights. The case has been discussed internationally, for example in Australia regarding the relevance of indigenous or aboriginal title.|$|E

5|$|Praseodymium is a {{chemical}} element with symbol Pr and atomic number 59. It {{is the third}} member of the lanthanide series and is traditionally considered {{to be one of}} the rare-earth metals. Praseodymium is a soft, silvery, malleable and ductile metal, valued for its magnetic, electrical, chemical, and optical properties. It is too reactive to be found <b>in</b> <b>native</b> form, and pure praseodymium metal slowly develops a green oxide coating.|$|E
5|$|Tellurium is a {{chemical}} element with symbolTe and atomic number52. It is a brittle, mildly toxic, rare, silver-white metalloid. Tellurium is chemically related to selenium and sulfur. It is occasionally found <b>in</b> <b>native</b> form as elemental crystals. Tellurium {{is far more}} common in the universe as a whole than on Earth. Its extreme rarity in the Earth's crust, comparable to that of platinum, is due partly to its high atomic number, but also to its formation of a volatile hydride which caused it to be lost to space as a gas during the hot nebular formation of the planet.|$|E

5|$|The coyote is a {{prominent}} character <b>in</b> <b>Native</b> American folklore, {{mainly in the}} Southwestern United States and Mexico, usually depicted as a trickster that alternately assumes {{the form of an}} actual coyote or a man. As with other trickster figures, the coyote uses deception and humor to rebel against social conventions. The animal was especially respected in Mesoamerican cosmology as a symbol of military might. After the European colonization of the Americas, it was reviled in Anglo-American culture as a cowardly and untrustworthy animal. Unlike wolves (gray, eastern, or red), which have undergone an improvement of their public image, attitudes towards the coyote remain largely negative.|$|E
