5|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>fiber</b> has {{increased}} in popularity since the discovery that asbestos causes cancer and its subsequent removal from most products. However, the safety of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> is also being called into question, as {{research shows that the}} composition of this material (asbestos and <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> are both silicate fibers) can cause similar toxicity as asbestos.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>fiber</b> (or glass fibre) is a {{material}} consisting of numerous extremely fine fibers of glass.|$|E
5|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>fiber</b> {{is formed}} when thin strands of silica-based or other {{formulation}} glass are extruded into many fibers with small diameters suitable for textile processing. The technique of heating and drawing glass into fine fibers {{has been known}} for millennia; however, the use of these fibers for textile applications is more recent. Until this time, all <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> had been manufactured as staple (that is, clusters of short lengths of fiber).|$|E
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this study was to clarify whether the short <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> of CaO-P 2 O 5 -SiO 2 -Al 2 O 3 (CPSA) glass possessed the ability to {{reinforce}} conventional glass-ionomer cement (GIC). Biocompatibility of the set GIC mixed with short CPSA <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> was evaluated in a cell culture cytotoxicity test. Moreover, the rate of release fluoride ions from GIC mixed with short <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> was measured. The powder of a conventional GIC was mixed with short CPSA <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> (diameter, 9. 7 ± 2. 1 μm; aspect ratio, 5. 0 ± 0. 9) before mixing with the liquid of the GIC. Set cements of 40 mass% short CPSA <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> mixed with GIC powders showed maximum values of 18 MPa in diametral tensile strength (DTS) after aging for 24 hours due to the effects of specific shape of short <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> and reactivity between the mixing liquid and short <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> The cytotoxicity of these cements to rat pulpal cells tested by cellular activity showed that the set GIC disks (13 mm in dia. × 1 mm in thickness) with 40 mass% short CPSA <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> had cell activity as that of the set GIC or a cell culture coverslip used as control. Moreover, the addition of short <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> to GIC did not disturb the release of fluoride from the specimens...|$|R
40|$|Nucleation {{activity}} of unsized and differently sized <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> during the crystallization of polypropylene from melt was investigated by polarizing light microscopy and DSC. Depending {{on the type}} of surface treatment, <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> were shown to exhibit different nucleating effects, evaluated by induction time of crystallization, crystallization onset temperature as well as half-time of crystallization in model composites with 50 % wt <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> Predominant nucleation activity was found for <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> sized with polypropylene compatible dispersion containing polyurethanes. However, according to the results of DSC measurements, unsized <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> slightly depressed the nucleation of polypropylene. Using the approach of Dobreva et al., the {{activity of}} the fibers towards heterogeneous nucleation during nonisothermal crystallization was evaluated...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. The {{mathematical}} {{model of the}} stress-strain curve of the strand of <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> was proposed and applied on the experimental data obtained for E <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> The model reflects the lognormal continuous distribution of the unstrained lengths of <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> and the Weibull distribution of the fibers strength. The regression treatment of experimental data provided the statistically robust estimates of {{the parameters of the}} lognormal length distribution, of the Young modulus, and of the parameters of the Weibull <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> strength distribution. It was shown that neglecting of the continuous unstrained length distribution leads to serious errors in estimates of the fiber strength distribution...|$|R

5|$|The modern {{method for}} {{producing}} glass wool is {{the invention of}} Games Slayter working at the Owens-Illinois Glass Co. (Toledo, Ohio). He first applied for a patent for a new process to make glass wool in 1933. The first commercial production of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> was in 1936. In 1938 Owens-Illinois Glass Company and Corning Glass Works joined to form the Owens-Corning Fiberglas Corporation. When the two companies joined to produce and promote <b>glass</b> <b>fiber,</b> they introduced continuous filament glass fibers. Owens-Corning is still the major glass-fiber producer in the market today.|$|E
5|$|Uses {{for regular}} <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> include mats and fabrics for thermal insulation, {{electrical}} insulation, sound insulation, high-strength fabrics or heat- and corrosion-resistant fabrics. It {{is also used}} to reinforce various materials, such as tent poles, pole vault poles, arrows, bows and crossbows, translucent roofing panels, automobile bodies, hockey sticks, surfboards, boat hulls, and paper honeycomb. It has been used for medical purposes in casts. <b>Glass</b> <b>fiber</b> is extensively used for making FRP tanks and vessels.|$|E
40|$|The {{present study}} was {{initiated}} to evaluate the pulmonary inflammatory and fibrotic responses induced by single and repeated exposures to <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> Single and repeated intratracheal injections of <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> induced an acute inflammatory response which progressed to a chronic inflammatory and fibrotic response. Mice exposed to <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> in single or repeated doses demonstrated elevated numbers of eosinophils, neutrophils and macrophages and increases in cell-free protein in lung lavage fluid at five days post-exposure. These parameters, in addition to relative lung/body weight ratios and lung tissue hydroxyproline levels, were elevated in comparison to saline control animals at five weeks post-exposure. Although repeated exposures to <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> did not potentiate the cellular inflammatory response, they did induce a marked infiltration of eosinophils, a response not observed with either asbestos or silica exposures. These observations suggest that <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> may be more toxic to the lungs than previously thought...|$|R
40|$|The {{presence}} of fillers/fibers can significantly affect the polymorphic behavior of semi-crystalline polymers. The influence of <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> on morphology of β-nucleated iPP during isothermal and nonisothermal crystallization was analyzed in detail by DSC, and the kinetics and thermodynamic parameters were determined for the systems containing 10 - 60 % <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> The {{presence of}} <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> in model composites with β-iPP has insignificant {{effect on the}} morphology of the polymer. Thermodynamic and kinetics parameters of crystallization of iPP in model composites are close to those obtained for the nucleated polymer. The relative content of β-crystalline phase is slightly affected by increasing <b>glass</b> <b>fiber’s</b> content from 10 % mas to 60 % mas, due to appearance of α-crystallites. However, the stability of β-crystalline phase is decreased by the increasing <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> content and there appeared certain amount of β 1 and β 2 phases which are known as disposed to recrystallization...|$|R
40|$|The {{bachelor}} {{thesis is}} aimed at an influence of surface modifications of fibrous reinforcements on mechanical properties at the fiber-matrix interface in <b>fiber</b> reinforced composites. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibers</b> were used as reinforcements and polyester resin was the matrix. The sample of composite consisted of polymer matrix in a form of cylindrical body placed on a bundle of <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> The tensile test using a materials testing machine (Zwick) was employed to evaluate adhesion at the fiber-matrix interface. Untreated <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> and fibers with commercial sizing were used for fabrication of composite samples...|$|R
5|$|Glass fibers {{are useful}} thermal {{insulators}} {{because of their}} high ratio of surface area to weight. However, the increased surface area makes them much more susceptible to chemical attack. By trapping air within them, blocks of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> make good thermal insulation, with a thermal conductivity {{of the order of}} 0.05 W/(m·K).|$|E
5|$|Glassmakers {{throughout}} history have experimented with glass fibers, but mass manufacture of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> was only made {{possible with the}} invention of finer machine tooling. In 1893, Edward Drummond Libbey exhibited a dress at the World's Columbian Exposition incorporating glass fibers with the diameter and texture of silk fibers. Glass fibers can also occur naturally, as Pele's hair.|$|E
5|$|Open-weave <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> grids {{are used}} to {{reinforce}} asphalt pavement. Non-woven glass fiber/polymer blend mats are used saturated with asphalt emulsion and overlaid with asphalt, producing a waterproof, crack-resistant membrane. Use of glass-fiber reinforced polymer rebar instead of steel rebar shows promise in areas where avoidance of steel corrosion is desired.|$|E
40|$|<b>Glass</b> <b>Fibers</b> of Li 2 O. 2 SiO 2 (LS 2) and Li 2 O. 1. 6 SiO 2 (LS 1. 6) {{compositions}} were heated near, but below, {{the glass}} transition temperature for different times while subjected to a constant bending stress of about 1. 2 GPa. The nucleation density and the crystallization tendency estimated by differential thermal analysis (DTA) of a glass sample {{in the vicinity of}} the maximum of the bending stress increased relative to that of stress-free <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> LS 2 <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> were found more resistant to nucleation and crystallization than the Ls 1. 6 <b>glass</b> <b>fibers.</b> These results are discussed in regards to shear thinning effects on glass stability...|$|R

Two types of concrete mixtures representing a lean mixture and an HPC (High Performance Concrete) mixture are used. Two types of AR <b>Glass</b> <b>fibers</b> High dispe rsion (HD) and High Performance (HP) with different sizing formulations {{to help with}} distribution, bonding and durability were considered. High dispersion (HD) AR <b>Glass</b> <b>fibers</b> of several different lengths were {{used to evaluate the}} effect of fibers which disperse thoroughly throughout the mixture.

5|$|The major global industrial-scale use {{of boron}} {{compounds}} (about 46% of end-use) is in production of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> for boron-containing insulating and structural fiberglasses, especially in Asia. Boron {{is added to}} the glass as borax pentahydrate or boron oxide, to influence the strength or fluxing qualities of the glass fibers. Another 10% of global boron production is for borosilicate glass as used in high strength glassware. About 15% of global boron is used in boron ceramics, including super-hard materials discussed below. Agriculture consumes 11% of global boron production, and bleaches and detergents about 6%.|$|E
5|$|The {{most common}} types of <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> used in {{fiberglass}} is E-glass, which is alumino-borosilicate glass {{with less than}} 1% w/w alkali oxides, mainly used for glass-reinforced plastics. Other types of glass used are A-glass (Alkali-lime glass {{with little or no}} boron oxide), E-CR-glass (Electrical/Chemical Resistance; alumino-lime silicate with less than 1% w/w alkali oxides, with high acid resistance), C-glass (alkali-lime glass with high boron oxide content, used for glass staple fibers and insulation), D-glass (borosilicate glass, named for its low Dielectric constant), R-glass (alumino silicate glass without MgO and CaO with high mechanical requirements as reinforcement), and S-glass (alumino silicate glass without CaO but with high MgO content with high tensile strength).|$|E
5|$|The rise {{in global}} demand {{has been driven}} by high growth rates in <b>glass</b> <b>fiber,</b> {{fiberglass}} and borosilicate glassware production. A rapid increase in the manufacture of reinforcement-grade boron-containing fiberglass in Asia, has offset the development of boron-free reinforcement-grade fiberglass in Europe and the USA. The recent rises in energy prices may lead to greater use of insulation-grade fiberglass, with consequent growth in the boron consumption. Roskill Consulting Group forecasts that world demand for boron will grow by 3.4% per year to reach 21 million tonnes by 2010. The highest growth in demand is expected to be in Asia where demand could rise by an average 5.7% per year.|$|E

40|$|In this paper, {{the dynamic}} {{behaviour}} of cement mortars reinforced with <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> was studied. The {{influence of the}} addition of <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> on energy absorption and tensile strength at high strain-rate was investigated. Static tests in compression, in tension and in bending were first performed.

5|$|Measuring the {{magnetic}} resonance of crystals first involved growing the crystals, a simple procedure often done by elementary school students. The crystals {{then had to}} be prepared by skillfully cutting them into sections with facets that had an orientation different from the internal structure of the crystal, and the response to a magnetic field had to be painstakingly measured. While his crystals were growing, Rabi read James Clerk Maxwell's 1873 A Treatise on Electricity and Magnetism, which inspired an easier method. He lowered a crystal on a <b>glass</b> <b>fiber</b> attached to a torsion balance into a solution whose magnetic susceptibility could be varied between two magnetic poles. When it matched that of the crystal, the magnet could be turned on and off without disturbing the crystal. The new method not only required much less work, it also produced a more accurate result. Rabi sent his thesis, entitled On the Principal Magnetic Susceptibilities of Crystals, to Physical Review on 16 July 1926. He married Helen the next day. The paper attracted little fanfare in academic circles, although it was read by Kariamanickam Srinivasa Krishnan, who used the method in his own investigations of crystals. Rabi concluded {{that he needed to}} promote his work as well as publish it.|$|E

40|$|ABSTRACT: Various {{forms of}} <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> arc {{available}} which provide advantages over microporous powders in evacuated thermal insulations. The main {{advantage is that}} evacuated thermal insulation made from <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> can provide thermal resis-tivities well in excess of 50 (F. ft 2. h/Btuin) as compared to microporous powders which are typically limited to maximum resistivities of 35. This paper presents a comparative overview of the properties of <b>glass</b> <b>fibers</b> {{as they relate to}} evacuated thermal insulations. <b>Glass</b> <b>fibers</b> in board and compressed blanket forms were evaluated for thermal conductivity at reduced pressures on sample insu-lations of different fiber diameters, densities, and fiber orientations Lateral heat flow, and load bearing properties in evacuated <b>fiber</b> <b>glass</b> insulations were also evaluated. The results indicate that <b>fiber</b> <b>glass</b> at densities of 8 - 15 lb/ft 3 and average fiber di-ameters of 0. 6 microns provide resistivities from 50 to 90 at pressures below 0. 30 mm Hg. Heat flow in these evacuated <b>fiber</b> <b>glass</b> insulations is as much as sixteen times greater in the lateral direction. Tests indicate that <b>fiber</b> <b>glass</b> insulations in various forms compress to densities greater than 11 lb/ft 3 when exposed to atmospheric load...|$|R
