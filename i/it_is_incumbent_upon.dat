2500|$|As {{will be seen}} in the {{following}} discussion, the propulsion system is designed to produce maximum traction motor torque at start-up, which explains why modern locomotives are capable of starting trains weighing in excess of 15,000 tons, even on ascending grades. [...] Current technology allows a locomotive to develop as much as 30 percent of its loaded driver weight in tractive force, amounting to some [...] of drawbar pull for a large, six-axle freight (goods) unit. [...] In fact, a consist of such units can produce more than enough drawbar pull at start-up to damage or derail cars (if on a curve) or break couplers (the latter being referred to in North American railroad slang as [...] "jerking a lung").

60|$|For {{the ideas}} and generalizations thus mainly formed from the images and {{impressions}} received in childhood become, in later years, {{the elements of the}} machinery, so to speak, by which all his mental operations are performed. Thus they seem to constitute more than the mere furniture of the mind; they form, as it were, almost a part of the structure itself. So true, indeed, is this, and so engrossing a part does what remains in the mind of former impressions play in its subsequent action, that some philosophers have maintained that the whole of the actual consciousness of man consists only in the resultant of all these impressions preserved more or less imperfectly by the memory, and made to mingle together in one infinitely complicated but harmonious whole. Without going to any such extreme as this, we can easily see, on reflection, how vast an influence on {{the ideas and}} conceptions, {{as well as on the}} principles of action in mature years, must be exerted by the nature and character of the images which the period of infancy and childhood impresses upon the mind. All parents should, therefore, feel that it is not merely the present welfare and happiness of their child that is concerned in their securing to him a tranquil and happy childhood, but that his capacity for enjoyment through life is greatly dependent upon it. They are, in a very important sense, intrusted with the work of building up the structure of his soul for all time, and <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> <b>upon</b> them, with reference to the future as well as to the present, to be very careful what materials they allow to go into the work, as well as in what manner they lay them.|$|E
60|$|From the {{internal}} situation of France, {{produced by the}} Revolution, War with the contiguous Powers was inevitable; {{sooner or later the}} evil must have been encountered; and it was of little importance whether England took a share in it somewhat earlier than, by fallible judgments, might be deemed necessary, or not. The frankness with which the faults that were committed have been acknowledged entitles the writer to some regard, when, speaking from an intimate knowledge of {{the internal}} state of France at that time, he affirms, that the war waged against her was, in a liberal interpretation of the words, just and necessary. At all events our Nation viewed it in this light. A large majority of the Inhabitants of Great Britain called for the war; and they who will the end will the means: the war being deemed necessary, taxes became indispensible for its support. Some might prefer one mode of raising them--some another; but these are minor considerations. Public men, united in bodies, must act on great principles. Mutual deference is a fundamental requisite for the composition and efficiency of a Party: for, if individual judgment is to be obtruded and insisted upon in subordinate concerns, the march of business will be perpetually obstructed. The leaders will not know whom they can depend upon, and therefore will be at a loss what to recommend, and how to act. If a public man differs from his Party in essentials, Conscience and Honour demand that he should withdraw; but if there be no such difference, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> <b>upon</b> him to submit his personal opinion to the general sense. He, therefore, who thought the prosecution of the war necessary, could not condemn the public Imposts; on this consequence the steady adherents of Ministers rest their claim to approbation, and advance it boldly in defiance of the outcry raised against the Government, on account of the burthens which the situation of Europe compelled it to lay upon the people.|$|E

6000|$|... [15] One point, however, <b>it</b> <b>is</b> <b>incumbent</b> <b>upon</b> me to notice, {{being no}} [...] {{question}} of art but of material. The reader will {{have observed that}} [...] I strictly limited the perfection of Turner's works {{to the time of}} [...] their first appearing {{on the walls of the}} Royal Academy. It bitterly [...] grieves me to have to do this, but the fact is indeed so. No [...] picture of Turner's is seen in perfection a month after it is [...] painted. The Walhalla cracked before it had been eight days in the [...] Academy rooms; the vermilions frequently lose lustre long before the [...] exhibition is over; and when all the colors begin to get hard a year [...] or two after the picture is painted, a painful deadness and opacity [...] comes over them, the whites especially becoming lifeless, and many [...] of the warmer passages settling into a hard valueless brown, even if [...] the paint remains perfectly firm, which is far from being always the [...] case. I believe that in some measure these results are unavoidable, [...] the colors being so peculiarly blended and mingled in Turner's [...] present manner as almost to necessitate their irregular drying; but [...] that they are not necessary to the extent in which they sometimes [...] take place, is proved by the comparative safety of some even of the [...] more brilliant works. Thus the Old Temeraire is nearly safe in [...] color, and quite firm; while the Juliet and her Nurse is now the [...] ghost of what it was; the Slaver shows no cracks, though it is [...] chilled in some of the darker passages, while the Walhalla and [...] several of the recent Venices cracked in the Royal Academy. It is [...] true that the damage makes no further progress after the first year [...] or two, and that even in its altered state the picture is always [...] valuable and records its intention; but it is bitterly to be [...] regretted that so great a painter should not leave a single work by [...] which in succeeding ages he might be estimated. The fact of his [...] using means so imperfect, together with that of his utter neglect of [...] the pictures in his own gallery, are a phenomenon in human mind [...] which appears to me utterly inexplicable; and both are without [...] excuse. If the effects he desires cannot be to their full extent [...] produced except by these treacherous means, one picture only should [...] be painted each year as an exhibition of immediate power, and the [...] rest should be carried out, whatever the expense of labor and time [...] in safe materials, even at the risk of some deterioration of [...] immediate effect. That which is greatest in him is entirely [...] independent of means; much of what he now accomplishes [...] illegitimately might without doubt be attained in securer [...] modes--what cannot should without hesitation be abandoned. [...] Fortunately the drawings appear subject to no such deterioration. [...] Many of them are now almost destroyed, but this has been I think [...] always through ill treatment, or has been the case only with very [...] early works. I have myself known no instance of a drawing properly [...] protected, and not rashly exposed to light suffering the slightest [...] change. The great foes of Turner, as of all other great colorists [...] especially, are the picture cleaner and the mounter.|$|E
