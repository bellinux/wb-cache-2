2500|$|Since {{the late}} 1970s, {{the use of}} CFCs has been heavily {{regulated}} because of their destructive effects on the ozone layer. After the development of his electron capture detector, James Lovelock {{was the first to}} detect the widespread presence of CFCs in the air, finding a mole fraction of 60 ppt of CFC-11 over Ireland. In a self-funded research expedition ending in 1973, Lovelock went on to measure CFC-11 in both the Arctic and Antarctic, finding the presence of the gas in each of 50 air samples collected, and concluding that CFCs are not hazardous to the environment. The experiment did however provide the first useful data on the presence of CFCs in the atmosphere. The damage caused by CFCs was discovered by Sherry Rowland and Mario Molina who, after hearing a lecture on the subject of Lovelock's work, embarked on research resulting in the first publication suggesting the connection in 1974. It turns out that one of CFCs' most attractive features—their low reactivity— is key to their most destructive effects. CFCs' lack of reactivity gives them a lifespan that can exceed 100 years, giving them time to diffuse into the upper stratosphere.

The presence of these fatty acids was supported by a gas-chromatography mass spectrometry investigation of the dimethyloxazoline derivatives of the species of the lipid extract.

50|$|Sigma bond {{cleavage}} also {{occurs on}} radical cations {{remote from the}} site of ionization. The cation has a radical on a heteratom or an unsaturated functional group. The driving force of fragmentation is the strong tendency of the radical ion for electron pairing. Cleavage occurs when the radical and an odd electron from the bonds adjacent to the radical migrate to form a bond between the alpha carbon and either the heteroatom or the unsaturated functional group. The sigma bond breaks; hence this cleavage is also known as <b>homolytic</b> bond <b>cleavage</b> or α-cleavage.|$|R

40|$|AbstractThe {{unimolecular}} {{reactions of}} protonated and metalated polyglycols with kiloelectronvolt translational energies {{have been studied}} by collisionally activated dissociation and neutralization-reionization mass spectrometry. The former method provides information on the ionic dissociation products, whereas the latter allows for {{the identification of the}} complementary neutral losses. Protonated linear polyglycols mainly undergo charge-initiated decompositions that lead to eliminations of smaller oligomers. On the other hand, protonated crown ethers (“cyclic” polyglycols) favor charge-induced reactions that proceed by cleavages of two ethylene oxide units in the form of 1, 4 -dioxane. Replacement of one O by NH in the crown ether dramatically changes its unimolecular chemistry; now, charge-remote 1, 4 -eliminations from ring-opened isomers are preferred. Charge-remote reactions are also the major decomposition channels of all metalated precursors studied. The linear polyglycols decompose primarily by 1, 4 -H 2 eliminations {{and to a lesser extent}} by <b>homolytic</b> <b>cleavages</b> near chain ends. The reverse is true for metalated crown ethers, which preferentially produce distonic radical cations by the loss of saturated radicals; these reactions are proposed to involve prior rearrangement to open-chain isomers. The nature of the metal ion (Li+, Na+, or K+) does not greatly affect the unimolecular chemistry of the cationized polyglycol. In general, metalated precursors form many abundant fragment ions over the entire mass range; hence, collisional activation of such ions at high kinetic energy should be particularly useful for structure elucidations...|$|R

Electrophilic silyl species placed ortho to unactivated tertiary sulfones react to form sultinium intermediates which suffer elimination in high yield at room temperature. Stannyl radical species placed ortho to allylic sulfones react to form intermediates which homolytically cleave to afford allyl radicals capable of further intramolecular cyclization reactions. Silylmethylene radicals attached ortho to tertiary sulfones abstract a β-sulfonyl hydrogen resulting in radical elimination of the sulfone and olefin formation. Addition of tris(trimethylsilyl) silyl radicals to ortho-allyldimethylsilyl aryl sulfones results in the formation of β-silyl radicals which promote <b>homolytic</b> sulfone <b>cleavage</b> to afford tertiary and secondary alkyl radicals. A separate investigation directed towards the functionalization of 1 H-perfluoroalkanes led to the discovery that deprotonation of 1 H-perfluoroalkanes at - 110 ∘ to - 115 ∘C followed by a CO 2 or SO 2 quench minimized interference from β-fluoride elimination and afforded perfluoroalkyl carboxylates and sulfinates in moderate to good yield. ...|$|R

50|$|Thromboxane A (TXA) {{is derived}} from the {{prostaglandin}} H2 (PGH2) molecule. PGH2 contains a relatively weak epidioxy bond, and a possible mechanism is known to involve <b>homolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> of the epidioxide and a rearrangement to TXA. A heme group in the active site of TXA synthase {{plays an important role in}} the mechanism. Stopped-flow kinetic studies with a substrate analog and recombinant TXA synthase revealed that substrate binding occurs in two steps. First, there is a fast initial binding to the protein and then a subsequent ligation to the heme iron. In the first step of the mechanism, the heme iron coordinates to the C-9 endoperoxide oxygen. It participates in <b>homolytic</b> <b>cleavage</b> of the O-O bond in the endoperoxide, which represents the rate-limiting step, and undergoes a change in redox state from Fe(III) to Fe(IV). A free oxygen radical forms at C-11, and this intermediate undergoes ring cleavage. With the free radical now at C-12, the iron heme then oxidizes this radical to a carbocation. The molecule is now ready for intramolecular ring formation. The negatively charged oxygen attacks the carbonyl, and the electrons from one of the double bonds are drawn to the carbocation, thus closing the ring.|$|E
40|$|International audienceFragmentation {{pathways}} of methacrylic polymers containing labile silyl ester pendant {{groups were}} characterized upon collisional activation of electrosprayed oligomer adducts. Dissociation of lithiated oligomers mainly generated low mass product ions containing the a end-group and arising from backbone bond <b>homolytic</b> <b>cleavages,</b> as typically observed for poly(alkylmethacrylate) s. Combined with {{the sum of}} the end-group masses as determined from MS data, this main reaction allowed both end-groups to be validated. In contrast, loss of HCOOR (with R = triisopropylsilyl) or elimination of alkene species from alkylsilyl groups, such as reported from poly(butylmethacrylate), was not observed here, probably due to steric hindrance of the pendant moieties. Activation of ammonium oligomer adducts was found to provide highly complementary information, since they exhibited a similar behavior as compared to poly(methacrylic acid), with serial eliminations of a triisopropylsilanol neutral conducting to the determination of the polymerization degree of the dissociating precursor ion. It should be noted however that this useful pathway was not always observed to efficiently compete with dissociation of reactive omega end-groups. Based on these fragmentation rules, five poly(triisopropylsilyl methacrylate) s were identified in a sample obtained via reversible addition-fragmentation chain transfer (RAFT) polymerization using cyanoisopropyl dithiobenzoate as the chain transfer agent. Their structure could be rationalized with regards to RAFT processes: (i) dormant chains initiated by a cyanoisopropyl group and terminated by a dithiobenzoate group, as the main species: (ii) proton- and (iii) vinyl-terminated dead chains produced by disproportionation termination events: (iv) alpha,omega-cyanoisopropyl-terminated polymer chains arising from a combination termination between two macromolecular propagating radicals, and (v) dormant chains containing methacrylic acid monomer units within the chain.

40|$|Abstract: Multistep radical {{processes}} are proposed to rationalize {{the formation of}} product ions formed by collisionally induced and spontaneous fragmentation of lithium-cationized 6 -alkenyl and 6 -alkadienyl salicylic acids.

Evidence is given by the observation that the fragmentation of ions formed by the loss of a hydrogen radical is similar to that found for the precursor [M-H+ 2 Li](+) ions. The proposed mechanisms also explain very well the observed enhanced abundances of ions whose formation involves formal benzylic, homobenzylic and homoallylic cleavages. The enhanced abundance of ions whose formation involves formal allylic cleavages can be readily rationalized by resonance stabilization of intermediate allylic radical ions...|$|R
