50|$|<b>Elcatonin</b> is a Calcitonin {{derivative}} {{which is}} transformed from eel's calcitonin {{by changing the}} S-S bond into the stable C-N bond. It inhibits the absorption and autolysis of bones, thus leads to blood calcium descending. In addition, it inhibits the bone salts dissolving and transferring and promotes the excretion of calcium and phosphorus in urine. Meanwhile, it inhibits renal tubules reabsorbing calcium, phosphorus and sodium and keeps blood calcium at normal level. It is mainly used for remitting or eliminating the pain caused by Osteoporosis.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: Background: Eel {{calcitonin}} (<b>elcatonin)</b> injection {{is widely}} used for elderly patients suffering from somatic pain in Japan. However, {{there have been few}} reports on the analgesic effects of <b>elcatonin</b> injection. The {{purpose of this study was}} to examine the analgesic effects of <b>elcatonin</b> injection in postmenopausal women with lower back pain. Methods: This study was designed as a double-blind, randomized, placebo-controlled study. Thirty-six women aged � 50 years with acute lower back pain participated in this study. They were randomly divided into two treatment groups according to whether they received a placebo or a weekly trigger point injection of <b>elcatonin</b> (20 units). They were observed for 5 weeks and the extent of pain at motion and at rest according to the visual analog scale (VAS) was evaluated. The mean VAS scores for the <b>elcatonin</b> group were then compared with those of the placebo group. Results: There were no statistically significant differences in the mean VAS scores for pain at rest between the two groups during the 5 -week treatment course. However, the mean VAS scores for motion pain in the <b>elcatonin</b> group were significantly lower than those in the placebo group at the third, fifth and sixth weeks. Conclusions: <b>Elcatonin</b> injection (20 units) significantly relieved motion pain in the lower back in postmenopausal women after three weeks of treatment. This analgesic effect continued for the subsequent 3 weeks...|$|E

40|$|AbstractWe have {{previously}} demonstrated that polypeptides (<b>elcatonin</b> and ACTH) can be actively absorbed across the rabbit nasal mucosa. In this paper {{we show that}} <b>elcatonin</b> is also transported when it is adsorbed onto microspheres (diameter: 0. 5 μm), whereas the elcatonin-uncovered microspheres do not display any net transport. Cytochalasin D (0. 1 μg/ml) abolishes the net absorption of <b>elcatonin</b> presented either alone or adsorbed. At the same concentration the inhibitor does not affect cellular active ion transports (and hence metabolism); although it increases intercellular ion and <b>elcatonin</b> permeability, it does not affect intercellular and paracellular permeability of the elcatonin-covered microspheres. Altogether, these results show that polypeptide transport {{is supported by a}} specific vesicular transfer inhibited by cytochalasin D by disassembly of the actin cytoskeleton, probably at the apical border of the cell...|$|E
40|$|The {{clinical}} {{usefulness of}} incadronate was compared with <b>elcatonin</b> in 26 patients with malignancy-associated hypercalcaemia. Data from 21 and 24 patients {{could be used}} to assess efficacy and safety, respectively. Eleven patients were given a single 10 -mg intravenous infusion of incadronate and 10 received twice-daily intramuscular injections of 40 IU of <b>elcatonin</b> for 7 consecutive days. After treatment, corrected serum calcium levels decreased significantly in both groups. The anti-hypercalcaemic effect of <b>elcatonin</b> was characterized by its rapid onset, with serum calcium levels reduced 1 day after administration. In contrast, the anti-hypercalcaemic effect of incadronate was more sustained but only became apparent a few days after infusion. Evaluation of symptoms revealed signifi-cantly greater improvement rates in the incadronate group compared with the <b>elcatonin</b> group. Adverse drug reactions were observed in three patients in the incadronate group, i. e. mild and transient fever in two cases and exacerbation of disturbance of consciousness in one case. These findings suggest that incadronate produces more marked and sustained hypocalcaemic effects than <b>elcatonin,</b> and that co-administration of these two drugs may yield both rapid and sustained control of malignancy-associated hyper-calcaemia...|$|E
40|$|Osteoporosis is {{associated}} with compromised quality of life (QOL), to which pain has the most important contribution. <b>Elcatonin,</b> a derivative of calcitonin, is widely used {{in the treatment of}} osteoporosis in two ways. One is as the inhibitor of osteoclastic bone resorption. The other is for osteoporosis-related pain based on the unique analgesic effects of <b>elcatonin.</b> Since pain is subjective in nature, and QOL is the only clinical outcome representing the patients’ subjective perception of health status, pain associated with osteoporosis would be best evaluated based on QOL assessment. Evidence based medicine gives the highest remarks to the double-blinded, randomized controlled trial, which, however, cannot be free from methodological problems on some occasions. For example, it is practically impossible to remain blinded in the trial of a potent analgesia, which in turn causes biases. Thus, the significance of taking the patients’ preference into account is increasingly acknowledged. In this study, 45 osteoporotic patients were given brochures describing the pros and cons on the three treatment choices; calcium and alfacalcidol, additional use of <b>elcatonin,</b> and additional use of bisphosphonate. Those who favored <b>elcatonin</b> were older, had more vertebral fractures, and lower QOL scores. QOL was evaluated before and three months after the treatment using SF- 8; the most widely used generic questionnaire, and RDQ; a lumbago-specific measure. <b>Elcatonin</b> treatment improved physical function, general health, and vitality of SF- 8, and RDQ score. Although this is a preliminary study, our results suggest that patients with vertebral fracture(s) have impaired QOL and more likely to favor <b>elcatonin</b> treatment expecting analgesia...|$|E
40|$|AbstractObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} the efficacy {{and safety of}} rhPTH (1 – 34) vs. <b>elcatonin.</b> MethodsSixty patients with primary OP were randomly {{divided into two groups}} according to the ratio of 3 : 1. rhPTH (1 – 34) group (PTH group) was treated with subcutaneous injection of rhPTH (1 – 34) 20 μ g daily for 18 months, and the <b>elcatonin</b> group (CT group) was treated with intramuscular injection of <b>elcatonin</b> 20 U weekly for 12 months. Bone mineral density (BMD) of the lumbar spine 2 – 4 (L 2 – 4) and femoral neck, serum calcium and phosphorus, urinary calcium, serum bone specific alkaline phosphatase (BSAP), and urinary c–terminal telopeptides of type I collagen/creatinine (uCTX–I/Cr) were tested at baseline, and 6, 12, and 18 months after treatment. ResultsIn PTH group, BMD of L 2 – 4 at 6, 12, and 18 months, BDM of femoral neck at 18 month, BSAP at 6 and 12 months and uCTX– I/Cr at 6, 12 and 18 months were all significantly raised. In CT group, BMD of L 2 – 4 at 12 month and that of femoral neck at 12 and 18 months were significantly elevated, while BSAP was significantly decreased at 12 and 18 months, and no significant difference on CTX– I/Cr was observed. When BMD growth and growth rate between two groups were compared, PTH group had better improvement in L 2 – 4 BMD and growth rate than CT group at 6, 12, and 18 months. BMD growth and growth rate of femoral neck at 12 month and its growth at 18 month in CT group were higher than in PTH group, but {{there was no significant difference}} between two groups regarding the growth rates at 18 month. Besides, there were no significant differences regarding the rates of adverse reactions between two groups. ConclusionsrhPTH (1 – 34), is safe and effective in the treatment of primary OP. It is superior to <b>elcatonin</b> in improving vertebral BMD at onset time, growth rate and growth range, but inferior to <b>elcatonin</b> at BMD of femoral neck...|$|E
40|$|Abstract Background The {{polypeptide}} hormone calcitonin is clinically {{well known for}} its ability to relieve neuropathic pain such as spinal canal stenosis, diabetic neuropathy and complex regional pain syndrome. Mechanisms for its analgesic effect, however, remain unclear. Here we investigated the mechanism of anti-hyperalgesic action of calcitonin in a neuropathic pain model in rats. Results Subcutaneous injection of <b>elcatonin,</b> a synthetic derivative of eel calcitonin, relieved hyperalgesia induced by chronic constriction injury (CCI). Real-time reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction analysis revealed that the CCI provoked the upregulation of tetrodotoxin (TTX) -sensitive Nav. 1. 3 mRNA and downregulation of TTX-resistant Nav 1. 8 and Nav 1. 9 mRNA on the ipsilateral dorsal root ganglion (DRG), which would consequently increase the excitability of peripheral nerves. These changes were reversed by <b>elcatonin.</b> In addition, the gene expression of the calcitonin receptor and binding site of 125 I-calcitonin was increased at the constricted peripheral nerve tissue but not at the DRG. The anti-hyperalgesic effect and normalization of sodium channel mRNA by <b>elcatonin</b> was parallel to the change of the calcitonin receptor expression. <b>Elcatonin,</b> however, did not affect the sensitivity of nociception or gene expression of sodium channel, while it suppressed calcitonin receptor mRNA under normal conditions. Conclusions These results suggest that the anti-hyperalgesic action of calcitonin on CCI rats could be attributable to the normalization of the sodium channel expression, which might be exerted by an unknown signal produced at the peripheral nerve tissue but not by DRG neurons through the activation of the calcitonin receptor. Calcitonin signals were silent in the normal condition and nerve injury may be one of triggers for conversion of a silent to an active signal. </p...|$|E

To evaluate the effect of basic fibroblast growth factor (bFGF), FK 506, <b>elcatonin,</b> and hyperbaric oxygenation (HBO) on osteoinduction by recombinant human bone morphogenetic protein- 2 (rhBMP- 2), 2 or 5 µg of rhBMP- 2 was implanted into intramuscular sites of rats. At 21 days after implantation, the osteoinductive activity in the treatment group and control group was compared radiographically, biochemically, and histologically. The amount of new bone in the treatment group was significantly greater than that in the control group. The alkaline phosphatase activity and calcium content in the treatment group were significantly higher than those in the control group. These results suggest that bFGF, FK 506, <b>elcatonin,</b> and HBO accelerated the activity and rate of osteoinduction by rhBMP 2.

A prospective open-labeled trial was conducted to compare the effects of short-term combined treatment with alendronate (ALN) and ECT on bone mineral density (BMD) and bone turnover with those of single treatment with ALN in postmenopausal women with osteoporosis. Two hundred and five postmenopausal osteoporotic women (mean age: 70 years) were recruited in our outpatient clinic. Forty-six women with back pain were treated with ALN and ECT (intramuscular, 20 units a week), and 159 women without obvious back pain were treated with ALN alone. The lumbar BMD, urinary levels of cross-linked N-terminal telopeptides of type I collagen (NTX), and serum levels of alkaline phosphatase (ALP) were measured during the six-month treatment period. The baseline characteristics, except for age, body weight and number of patients with prevalent vertebral fractures, {{were not significantly different}} between the two groups. The mean increase rate in the lumbar BMD at six months was similar in the ALN (+ 4. 41 %) and ALN+ECT (+ 5. 15 %) groups, following similar reduction rates in urinary NTX levels (- 40. 2 % and - 43. 0 %, respectively, at three months) and serum ALP levels (- 19. 0 % and - 19. 7 %, respectively, at six months). These results were consistent even after adjustments for age, body weight, and number of patients with prevalent vertebral fractures. The present study in postmenopausal osteoporotic women confirmed that the effects of short-term combined treatment with ALN and ECT on lumbar BMD and bone turnover in patients with back pain appeared to be comparable to those of single treatment with ALN in patients without obvious back pain.

30|$|Analysis of {{many other}} {{injectable}} generic products showed that they not only met the purity specification, but also contained similar compositions of related substances {{to those in the}} original products except in the case of two APIs.

The Committee recommended the manufacturer for a root-cause analysis and improvement of the formulations. The manufacturer found that the impurity was a sulfite ion adduct potentially formed during the heat sterilization process. After implementation of the process improvements and changes in the API suppliers, the Formulation WG confirmed the decrease of impurities in these generic products to a level comparable to those in the original product. Some reports suggested higher proportion of adverse effects in some generic ritodrine products, although the relationship between their quality and clinical observation was not clear (Umezawa and Fujita 2013). The other case involved the presence of a small amount of phenol in two <b>elcatonin</b> injection formulations that was described as process-related impurity.|$|E
40|$|Abstract Introduction Tamoxifen may {{occasionally}} precipitate {{serious and}} potentially life-threatening hypercalcemia. However, to date, {{this has not}} been documented with aromatase inhibitors. Case presentation A 65 -year-old Japanese woman with liver metastasis from breast cancer was admitted to our hospital with vomiting, anorexia, fatigue, arthralgia, muscle pain and dehydration. She had started a course of letrozole five weeks earlier. Our patient's calcium level was 11. 6 mg/dL. She was rehydrated and <b>elcatonin</b> was administered. Our patient's parathyroid hormone and parathyroid hormone-related protein levels were not increased and a bone scintigram revealed no evidence of skeletal metastasis. After our patient's serum calcium level returned to within the normal range, letrozole was restarted at one-half of the previous dose (1. 25 mg). There were no episodes of hypercalcemia. However, 84 days after restarting letrozole, our patient again complained of arthralgia and treatment was changed to toremifene. During these periods, repeated ultrasonograms revealed no progression of liver metastasis. Conclusion To the best of our knowledge, this is the first case report of flare hypercalcemia after treatment with letrozole in a patient with metastatic breast cancer. </p...|$|E
40|$|Bone {{status is}} the most {{important}} finding in multiple myeloma. The changes in the bone were examined by various methods such as elcation test, bone x-ray, bone scintigraphy, urine hydroxyproline and quantitative bone mineral by computed tomography (QCT). The elcation test was evaluated in 87 patients with multiple myeloma and 15 with osteopor-osis. The maximum value of hypocalcemia induced by <b>elcatonin</b> was ≧ 0. 25 mmol/L which was considered as an abnormal response compared with the mormal response. The elcationin test is related to the prevailing rate of osteoclastic bone resorption. Myeloma patients with advanced bone disease (multiple lytic lesion, Mixed type) had a higher abnormal response such as hypercalcemia, hyper ALP, hot of the bone status, urine hydroxproline and decrease in the bone mineral then myeloma patients with slight bone disease (diffuse proliferation type). Moreover, the elcation test can indicate whether the durg will be effective in the hyper calcemia. We conclude that the elcation test is important in the evaluation of the bone resorption as a simple test for the prognosis and followed up the skeletal disease in the patients with multiple myeloma...|$|E
40|$|AbstractAn active {{absorption}} of polypeptides (<b>elcatonin</b> = CCT; adrenocorticotropic hormone) {{had been previously}} observed in the nasal respiratory mucosa of the rabbit. Its saturation kinetics and the parallel absence of a net transfer of other non-polypeptidic organic markers excluded the involvement of a simple pinocytosis. This absorption has been now better localized and further characterized. Unidirectional CCT fluxes (determined with radioimmunoassay) have been concomitantly monitored with transepithelial electric potential difference (Vms). Although the mucosae covering the ectoturbinal A and the lower and upper conchae displayed similar Vms, the active CCT transport was only evidenced in the upper concha. In this region cytochalasin B (which by disassembling actin microfilaments prevents the apical formation of vesicles in epithelial cells) and monensin (which prevents the split of the ligand-receptor complex in the endosomes) both eliminated the net CCT absorption, however, also permanently increasing the passive CCT junctional permeability. Aluminium fluoride (which prevents the fusion of endocytic vesicles into endosomes) and colchicine (which disrupts microtubules along which vesicles move in the cytoplasm) also permanently abolished net CCT transport, without affecting, or shortly and transiently affecting, passive permeability. On the whole these results {{are in favor of}} an active CCT transport supported by a specific vesicular transport...|$|E
40|$|Because {{there is}} {{clinical}} evidence for {{an association between}} periodontal disease and rheumatoid arthritis, {{it is important to}} develop suitable experimental models to explore pathogenic mechanisms and therapeutic opportunities. The K/BxN serum model of inflammatory arthritis was applied using distinct protocols, and modulation of joint disruption afforded by dexamethasone and calcitonin was established in comparison to the melanocortin (MC) receptor agonist DTrp 8 –γ-melanocyte stimulating hormone (MSH; DTrp). Wild-type and MC receptor type 3 (MC 3) -null mice of different ages were also used. There was significant association between severity of joint disease, induced with distinct protocols and volumes of the arthritogenic K/BxN serum, and periodontal bone damage. Therapeutic treatment with 10 μg dexamethasone, 30 ng <b>elcatonin,</b> and 20 μg DTrp per mouse revealed unique and distinctive pharmacological properties, with only DTrp protecting both joint and periodontal tissue. Further analyses in nonarthritic animals revealed higher susceptibility to periodontal bone loss in Mc 3 r−/− compared with wild-type mice, with significant exacerbation at 14 weeks of age. These data reveal novel protective properties of endogenous MC 3 on periodontal status in health and disease and indicate that MC 3 activation could lead {{to the development of a}} new genus of anti-arthritic bone-sparing therapeutics...|$|E
40|$|Humoral hypercalcemia of {{malignancy}} (HHM) {{is caused}} by the oversecretion of parathyroid hormone-related peptide (PTHrP) from malignant tumors. Although any tumor may cause HHM, that induced by intrahepatic cholangiocarcinoma (ICC) or gastric cancer (GC) is rare. We report here a 74 -year-old male who displayed HHM with both ICC and GC and showed an elevated serum PTHrP level. Treatment of the hypercalcemia with saline, furosemide, <b>elcatonin,</b> and zoledronic acid corrected his serum calcium level and improved symptoms. Because treatment of ICC should precede that of GC, we chose chemotherapy with cisplatin (CDDP) and gemcitabine (GEM). Chemotherapy reduced the size of the ICC and decreased the serum PTHrP level. One year after diagnosis, the patient was alive {{in the face of a}} poor prognosis for an ICC that produced PTHrP. Immunohistochemical staining for PTHrP was positive for the ICC and negative for the GC, leading us to believe that the cause of the HHM was a PTHrP-secreting ICC. In conclusion, immunohistochemical staining for PTHrP may be useful in discovering the cause of HHM in the case of two cancers accompanied by an elevated serum PHTrP level. Chemotherapy with CDDP and GEM may be the most appropriate treatment for a PTHrP-secreting ICC...|$|E
40|$|INTRODUCTION: Previous work {{reported}} the anti-arthritic synergy afforded by combining calcitonin (CT) and glucocorticoids (GC). Here {{we focus on}} the pairing of <b>elcatonin</b> (eCT) and dexamethasone (Dex), querying whether: i) this was a class-effect action; ii) mechanistic insights could be unveiled; iii) the synergy affected canonical GC adverse effects. METHODS: Using the rat collagen-induced arthritis model, different combinations of eCT and Dex, were administered from disease onset to peak (day 11 to 18). Macroscopic disease score was monitored throughout, with biochemical and histological analyses conducted on plasma and tissues at day 18. The effect on acute hyperglycaemia and liver enzyme message were also assessed. RESULTS: Whilst eCT alone was inactive, it synergised at 1 µg/kg with low doses of Dex (7. 5 or 15 µg/kg) to yield an anti-arthritic efficacy equivalent to a 4 - to 7 -fold higher Dex dose. Mechanistically, the anti-arthritic synergy corresponded to a marked attenuation in RA-relevant analytes. CXCL 5 expression, in both plasma and joint, was markedly inhibited by the co-therapy. Finally, co-administration of eCT did not exacerbate metrics of GC adverse effects, and rescued some of them. CONCLUSIONS: We present evidence of a class-effect action for the anti-arthritic synergy of CT/GC combination, underpinned by the powerful inhibition of joint destruction markers. Furthermore, we identify CXCL 5 as a marker for the combination therapy with potential diagnostic and prognostic utility. Substantial GC dose reduction, together with the absence of exacerbated adverse effects, indicated a significant clinical potential for this co-therapy in RA and beyond...|$|E
40|$|Conformational {{change of}} calcitonins has been {{examined}} {{by measuring the}} rate of hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange in amino acids. Time dependent m/z shift caused by H/D exchange was monitored by electrospray ionization quadrupole ion trap mass spectrometry (ESI-QIT MS). The rate constants of H/D exchange were calculated from apparent first-order kinetics. The time course of H/D exchange exhibited two phases of faster and slower exchange. The smaller rate constant (k 2) estimated from the slower H/D exchange was correlated with an α-helix content that reflected the folding state. The order of k 2 values obtained for human calcitonin (hCT), porcine calcitonin (pCT), salmon calcitonin (sCT), and <b>elcatonin</b> (ECT) was hCT > pCT ≈ sCT > ECT. Although the amino acid sequence of sCT {{is similar to that}} of ECT, their k 2 values were considerably different. The results suggest that ECT is relatively rigid on the N-terminal side cyclic structure in the folded state. Further, the effect of methionine oxidation on k 2 has been examined. In the oxidized pCT that possesses similar biological activity with the intact pCT, the k 2 values obtained were nearly equal. The k 2 of hCT increased via methionine oxidation, and the biological activity was weakened by oxidation. This suggested that methionine oxidation of hCT produced unfolding in the secondary structure and that oxidative unfolding of hCT led to the loss of biological activity. The results indicate that the H/D exchange rate constant may be used as an informative parameter to elucidate the relationship between the folded state and biological activity of polypeptides like calcitonins with secondary structure...|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES [...] <b>Elcatonin</b> (eCT), an eel {{calcitonin}} derivative, {{is shown}} to considerably improve the clinical signs and symptoms, as well as laboratory data, in patients with rheumatoid arthritis (RA). The therapeutic efficacy of eCT, however, is reduced by preceding and/or concomitant use of corticosteroid. Thus the effects of eCT on the production of immunoglobulins, IgMRF and interleukin- 1 (IL- 1) by mononuclear cells (MNCs) /monocytes were studied, and compared among patients with RA that received three kinds of treatment and also normal volunteers (NV). METHODS [...] Ten patients with RA had been treated with a non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drug only (NSAID group), 11 with oral prednisolone (PSL group), and eight with intramuscular eCT (eCT group). MNCs/monocytes from these patients, and also 10 from the NV group, were collected and cultured. IgG, IgA, IgM, IgMRF, IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta in the supernatants were measured by enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay (ELISA). In the NSAID, PSL and NV groups, eCT {{was added to the}} culture medium, and the effects of eCT on production of these substances were studied. RESULTS [...] Baseline production of IgM, IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta by MNCs/monocytes in the eCT and NV groups was significantly lower than that in the NSAID group. Furthermore, addition of eCT to the culture medium significantly inhibited the productions of IgG, IgMRF, IL- 1 alpha and IL- 1 beta by MNCs/monocytes in the NSAID group, whereas production of neither IgG, IgA, IgM, IgMRF nor IL- 1 by MNCs/monocytes in the PSL and NV groups was affected by eCT. CONCLUSION [...] eCT may regulate immune responses through MNC/monocyte function in patients with RA. The present results support our proposal that eCT is an effective agent for the treatment of RA...|$|E

40|$|Yoichi KishikawaKishikawa Orthopaedic Clinic, Saga City, Saga, JapanPurpose: The aim of {{the present}} {{conventional}} observational study was to compare the clinical outcomes of initial non-weight-bearing therapy and conventional relative rest therapy among elderly patients with clinical vertebral fractures. Methods: In total, 196 consecutive patients with clinical vertebral fractures (mean age: 78 years) who were hospitalized for treatment between January 1999 and March 2007 were analyzed. Initial non-weight-bearing therapy consisted of complete bed rest allowing rolling on the bed without any weight-bearing to the spine for 2 weeks, followed by rehabilitation wearing a soft brace. The indications for initial non-weight-bearing therapy were vertebral fracture involving the posterior portion of the vertebral body at the thoraco-lumbar spine, mild neurological deficit, instability of the fracture site, severe pain, multiple vertebral fractures arising from trauma, malalignment at the fracture site, and mild spinal canal stenosis caused by the fracture. Patients who met the indication criteria were treated with initial non-weight-bearing therapy (n = 103), while the other patients were treated with conventional relative rest (n = 93). All the patients were uniformly treated with intramuscular <b>elcatonin</b> to relieve pain. The primary endpoint was progression of the vertebral fracture. The secondary endpoints included bony union and subjective back pain. The follow-up period was 12 weeks. Results: Compared with the conventional relative rest group, the collapse rate of the anterior and posterior portions of the vertebral body was significantly smaller in the initial non-weight-bearing group. The bony union rate was 100 % in the initial non-weight-bearing group and 97 % in the conventional relative rest group. The number of patients who experienced back pain was significantly lower in the initial non-weight-bearing group than in the conventional relative rest group. Conclusion: These results suggest that initial non-weight-bearing therapy is important for preventing vertebral body collapse and for relieving pain among elderly patients with clinical vertebral fractures.
