6000|$|... "Do {{you mean}} about the lawsuit? I don't care for that! <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he <b>will</b> hate {{me when he}} sees me? <b>Do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> he <b>will</b> believe me when I tell him that I never meant to leave him, and that I'm sorry for what I did to drive him away?" ...|$|R

6000|$|... "You wicked woman--you disgrace me. But there! You always resembled your father. What <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> {{become of}} you [...] . {{in the other}} world? In this [...] . Oh misery!" ...|$|E
6000|$|MRS. TWYMLEY. 'Sitting {{here by the}} fire, you and me, as one to another, what <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> {{happen after}} the war? Are we {{to go back to}} being as we were?' ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Not {{a better}} {{air in the}} whole piece, Artie; but, my boy, who <b>do</b> <b>you</b> <b>think</b> <b>will</b> ever {{understand}} the meaning of the words. The gods themselves won't know what you're driving at.' ...|$|E

6000|$|... “Well, Mr. Gilmore, this {{certainly}} {{appears to be}} the richest haul that has ever been made in these islands, at any rate {{since the days of the}} Spanish galleons.

6000|$|Colville lay silent. [...] "There is no {{forgiveness}} to {{be asked}} or granted," [...] he said, at length.

6000|$|MARGARET. I am {{not quite}} sure whether I want you to. It makes such a difference. Perhaps you won't know me. Even the pool is looking a little scared.
