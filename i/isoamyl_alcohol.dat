At the end of the monitoring period, free monoterpenic and fermentative compounds characterised the aromatic profile of the wine. Linalool and nerol had a similar concentration, while the main fermentative compounds were the <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohols,</b> 2 -phenylethanol, medium-chain fatty acids and their corresponding ethyl esters, and isoamyl acetate.

The higher alcohols (concentration up to 200 mg/L) and their esters also made a pleasant contribution to the aroma definition. Finally, the low temperature of fermentation helped to preserve the varietal aroma and enhanced the production of fermentative compounds, with a corresponding restraint of higher alcohols.

40|$|Graduation date: 2014 Access {{restricted}} to the OSU Community, at author's request, from June 16, 2014 - Dec. 16, 2014 High vegetative growth of Pinot Noir vine is a common problem in most vineyards of Oregon's Willamette Valley, where sunlight exposure and heat accumulation are limited. Consequently, growers in this region commonly use vineyard management strategies to regulate vine vigor and improve grape and wine quality. Wine quality is greatly correlated with grape volatile composition. However, no study {{has been done to}} fulfill the knowledge gap of how specific viticultural practice affect Oregon Pinot Noir grape and wine volatile composition. Accordingly, three studies were conducted to evaluate impacts of viticultural practices (i. e., cover crop, leaf removal, and crop thinning) on the volatile composition of Pinot Noir grape and wine in the Willamette Valley of Oregon. Pinot Noir grape chemical and volatile composition was investigated over three growing seasons (2008, 2009, and 2010) in a commercial vineyard where vines were managed using three vineyard floor management practices. The vineyard floor practices included different inter-row management: permanent grass (Festuca rubra spp. rubra) cover (Grass), alternating grass cover and tillage (Alternate), and tillage of every alleyway (Tilled). Fruit chemical and volatile compositions were analyzed by High Performance Liquid Chromatography (HPLC) and Stir Bar Sorptive Extraction-Gas Chromatography-Mass Spectrometry (SBSE-GC-MS). Results showed that different vineyard floor practices did not affect the grape general ripeness in most of years (2008 and 2009), but in 2010, Grass treatment caused decreases levels of sugar and organic acids in grapes. In addition, Grass treatment reduced levels of berry free amino acids but increased levels of quercetin glycosides and anthocyanins. Compositions of grape volatile and their precursors were also affected by treatments. Grass treatment increased free-form terpenoids and decreased free-form C₆ compounds (hexanal, trans- 2 -hexenal and 1 -hexanol) and β-damascenone in most of the years. There was a negative correlation between vine pruning weight and levels of free-form terpenoids, while, a positive correlation between vine pruning weight and free-form C₆ compounds and β-damascenone. Furthermore, Alternate treatment had the highest concentrations of bound-form terpenoids. Wines were made when grapes reached commercial maturity and wine compositions were analyzed using HPLC, GC-FID and GC-MS. Results showed that the wine made from grapes with vineyard floor management treatments Alternate and Grass had higher levels of anthocyanins compared to Tilled treatment. Wine volatile composition was affected by treatments as well but in different ways. Cover crop treatments increased levels of branched-chain esters, acetates, terpenoids, and phenethyl alcohol in wine; meanwhile, they decreased levels of straight-chain ethyl esters, higher alcohols (1 -propanol, isobutyl <b>alcohol,</b> and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohols),</b> β-damascenone, ethyl vanillate, dimethyl sulfite and methanethiol. A second study was conducted to further investigate the impact of fruit-zone leaf removal practice on Pinot Noir grape and wine volatile composition over three growing seasons (2010, 2011, and 2012). Grapevines were managed to have four different leaf removal treatments, including removing 0...|$|R
40|$|Beer is an {{extremely}} popular beverage worldwide, representing the third-most popular drink after water and tea. And barley is the major raw material used for beer production. However, various combinations of pesticides are widely used at several stages of barley culti¬vation and during post-harvest storage to control pest and fungal disease. Hence, traces of these pesticides might remain in the beer produced from the treated ingredients. Hence, monitoring trace levels of pesticide residues during beer brewing and investigated the effects of pesticide residue {{on the quality of}} beer is essential. First, the behavior and fate of 3 pesticides (triadimefon, malathion, and dichlorvos) and the main metabolites (triadimenol and malaoxon) during barley storage or beer processing were assessed using a pilot-plant equipment. The residues of all products were determined using liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry. Field investigation of the dissipation rate kinetics for triadimefon and malathion during storage indicated that their half-life was twice as high when 5 times the recommended dosage was used. Milling had little effect on removing dichlorvos and malathion residues, whereas they were substantially removed when the spent grains were mashed. The calculated processing factors after processing were all < 1, indicating that the residual ratios of dichlorvos and malathion were reduced during the entire process. In conclusion, storage and processing extensively reduced pesticide residue levels in barley and beer; however, greater focus needs to be paid to the toxicity of their metabolites in commercial by-products. Then we selected the triadimefon as the target fungicide to further study its behavior, the dissipation kinetics of TF during fermentation mediated by two different yeast strains, Saccharomyces cerevisiae IAPPST 1401 (Y 1) and CICC 1202 (Y 2), and found that Y 2 promoted the degradation of TF. Response surface methodology was used to optimize fermentation process variables, in order to achieve the maximum removal rate of TF and the minimum production of its corresponding metabolite, triadimenol (TN). Triadimefon is also a widely used triazole fungicide with one chiral carbon center, Stereoselective degradation of triadimefon was found during barley storage, the half-life of S-(+) -triadimefon was 36. 5 d, 31. 5 d and 30. 1 d, while R-(-) -traidmefon was 69. 3 d, 53. 3 d and 33 d under 4 °C, 25 °C and 40 °C, respectively. During brewing process, both enantiomers of triadimefon were easily degraded. After fermentation, little triadimefon detected in the beer, while RS-(+) and SS-(-) -triadimenol were detectable. This research provides accurate information for evaluating the risk of food safety. Furthermore, we investigated the effect of triadimefon affect the quality and flavor of the fermented beer, The effect of triadimefon on yeast growth and the sensory quality of beer were studied. There were significant differences in sensory quality between beer samples fermented with and without triadimefon based on data obtained with an electronic tongue and nose. Such an effect was most likely underlain by changes in yeast fermentation activity, including decreased utilization of maltotriose and most amino acids, reduced production of isobutyl and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohols,</b> and increased ethyl acetate content in the fungicide treated samples. Furthermore, yeast metabolic profiling by phenotype microarray and UPLC/TOF-MS showed that triadimefon caused significant changes in the metabolism of glutathione, phenylalanine and sphingolipids, and in sterol biosynthesis. Thus, triadimefon negatively affects beer sensory qualities by influencing the metabolic activity of S. cerevisiae during fermentation, emphasizing the necessity of stricter control over fungicide residues in brewing by the food industry...|$|R

This study focused on the inhibitors of xylanase present in local rye cultivars, and their influence on the efficiency of the fermentation processes during bioethanol production from rye residues in comparison with common wheat. Different origin xylanases from Thermomyces lanuginosus and Trichoderma reesei were the objects of the investigations. Kinetic studies of these xylanases in the presence of proteins with inhibitory activity indicated that Th. lanuginosus was found more sensitive to proteinaceous xylanase inhibitors presented in rye than T. reesei. The highest yield of xylose and arabinose was achieved by adding T. reesei to cell wall substrates, while Th. lanuginosus converted to arabinoxylans only into xylooligosaccharides and monosaccharide were not released.

The {{aim of this study}} was to evaluate the effect of three strains of Saccharomyces spp. (var. 1, 2 and 3) on wine aroma compounds produced in microvinification assays. Microvinification assays were carried out with Vitis vinifera cv Síria grapes using the strains in study as starters. Aroma compounds were identified and quantified by GC-FID and GC-MS. At the end of fermentation process and during the first three months of maturation some aroma compounds were detected, namely propanol, isobutanol, <b>isoamyl</b> acetate, isoamylic <b>alcohol,</b> ethyl hexanoate, ethyl lactate, hexanol, ethyl octanoate, 3 -ethylhydroxibutirate, benzaldehyde, 3 -methyl- 2 -butanol, 2, 3 -butanediol, g-butyrolactone, ethyl decanoate, diethyl succinate, methionol, 4 -hydroxi- 2 -butyrolactone, heptanoic acid, phenylethyl acetate, ethyl dodecanoate, phenylethanol, octanoic acid, 2 -methoxy- 4 - vinylphenol and decanoic acid. Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) were used to predict the concentration of twelve wine aroma compounds from the phenyl ethanol, propanol, isobutanol, hexanol, heptanoic acid, octanoic acid and decanoic acid concentrations. Results showed that, either, maturation time and Saccharomyces strain used as starter influence the aroma compounds produced. Wines produced with S. cerevisae var. 1 and S. cerevisae var. 2 showed a similar composition in aroma compounds, relatively to the wines produced with the strain S. cerevisae var. 3. However, for S. cerevisae var. 1 and S. cerevisae var. 2 the time of maturation influence the aroma composition of wines.

Production of isoamyl and isobutyl alcohols begins after the sugar level is lowered substantially and continues {{for several hours}} after the alcoholic fermentation ends. In contrast, ethanol production begins in the first hours of the fermentation and ends with logarithmic yeast growth. The alcohol content in tequila is affected by three factors. First the amount of <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> and isobutanol is the yeast strain. Second, the carbon:nitrogen ratio. The higher the ratio, the more alcohol produced. And third, the temperature of fermentation.|$|E
50|$|Tequila is a {{distilled}} beverage {{that is made}} from the fermentation of the sugars found from the blue agave plant once it has been cooked, the main sugar being fructose. Through the fermentation process, many factors influence the higher alcohol content of tequila, which are molecules such as isobutyl alcohol and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> and ethanol. These parameters include the type of yeast strain, {{the age of the}} agave plant itself, temperature, and the carbon/nitrogen ratio. However, the type of yeast strain used and the carbon/nitrogen factors have the biggest influence on the production of higher alcohols, this is not surprising as higher alcohol and ethanol production is an intrinsic property of the metabolism of each strain. The type of yeast most commonly found in tequila is Saccharomyces cerevisiae, which contains many strains. For example, CF1 agaves, a type of yeast, produces much more ethanol than a strain of CF2, as the yeast's metabolism mechanisms differ from one another. This factor may be influenced from different agricultural practices that occur to cultivate the different yeasts strains. It was found that the higher the carbon/ nitrogen ratio, the higher the production of higher alcohols such as isobutyl alcohol and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> A high ratio imparts that there is less nitrogen in the fermentation process, which results in deamination reactions of amino acids, leading to the synthesis of higher alcohols. The Ehrlich pathway is the name for this process, where a-ceto acids are decarboxylated and transformed to aldehydes and to higher alcohols. The temperature of the fermentation process also greatly effects the alcohol content of the resulting product. For example, a study conducted by Pinal et al. found that cultivating two strains at a temperature of 35 degrees as compared to a temperature of 30 degrees produced more <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The higher temperature suggests that this is a much more optimal condition for the yeast to ferment the {{distilled beverage}}. Lastly the age of the agave plant itself, the older the plant the greater the alcohol production. It was shown in a study that the concentration of amyl alcohol increased as the plant aged by a factor 30%. However, it is also found that there is a higher concentration of methanol found when using younger plants. This may be due to differences in agricultural practices that occur when taking care of plants of different ages.|$|E
5000|$|Higher order {{alcohols}} have {{a strong}} aroma, and the quantity present in each tequila depends on the carbon:nitrogen ratio and temperature during the cooking and fermentation processes. Some {{of the most common}} alcohols present other than ethanol are: <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol,</b> isobutanol, and 1-propanol. Methanol is thought to be mainly generated through hydrolysis of methylated pectin which is naturally present in the agave plant, but there has been speculations that it is also partly produced from the enzymatic reactions of yeast strains containing pectin methyl esterase enzyme which break up the methoxyl group from the pectin. Nearly 50 different esters identified in tequila which together give rise to the fruit like flavors and smell. One of the most abundant esters is ethyl acetate which is synthesized during fermentation by the yeast Saccharomyces cerevisiae, using alcohol transferase enzyme which links acetic acid to ethanol.|$|E

Five lipases (palatase 20000 L, lipase AYS “Amano”, lipase A “Amano ” 12, piccantase A and piccantase AN) were used to biosynthesize isoamyl esters in coconut cream supplemented with <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol.</b> The lipases have different abilities to synthesize isoamyl esters with lipase AYS “Amano”, palatase 20000 L and piccantase A showing the highest potential. Bioproduction of isoamyl octanoate by palatase 20000 L was further examined under different conditions of temperature, pH, <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration and lipase amount. Biosynthesis of isoamyl octanoate by palatase was not significantly affected at 30 - 50 °C or pH of 4 to 7 and its maximum bioproduction was obtained at <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> concentration of 4 % (v/v) and lipase amount of 6 mg 100 mL- 1 reaction mixture. The lipase-treated coconut cream {{may serve as a}} bioflavouring ingredient for food applications or for extraction of pure aroma chemicals...|$|E
30|$|Hexanol and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> {{are higher}} {{alcohols}} that are extensively found in foods, especially in alcoholic drinks (Styger et al. 2011). Excessive hexanol and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> content distorts food flavor and taste, and even causes headaches and {{damage to the}} human neurological system (Bai et al. 2011). Ingestion of these alcohols {{is considered one of}} the main causes of alcoholic intoxication. Currently, hexanol is listed in the Hazardous Substances Data Bank (HSDB) as a hazardous substance that can inflict harm to body, with a 50 % lethal dose (LD 50) value of 720  mg/kg (Lachenmeier et al. 2008). Numerous attempts have been made to decrease hexanol and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> production during food processing using absorption treatments and modified yeast strains (Callejón et al. 2009). However, few of these methods have been approved for practice due to the suppression of ethanol production or low specificity. The enzyme treatment is widely accepted in food processing due to its high specificity and gentle treatment conditions. The currently known enzymes with activity to hexanol and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> are mainly alcohol acyltransferase (Yahyaoui et al. 2002) and alcohol dehydrogenase (Park et al. 2007). However, these enzymes are normally active at pH values around 7 – 8, and so are not suitable for wine and liquors that typically are acidic with a pH lower than 4.0. We previously found that Geotrichum candidum S 12 demonstrated high hexanol and <b>isoamyl</b> <b>alcohol</b> activities at a pH rate around 4.0, showing a great potential to specifically reduce the level of higher alcohols in alcoholic products. The responsible enzyme was primarily identified as hexanol dehydrogenase (Zhang et al. 2013 b). However, there has not been further characterization of the enzyme fraction with hexanol-degradation activity.|$|E
