40|$|Distribution {{networks}} {{have traditionally been}} designed for unidirectional power flow. Large scale implementation of distributed generation (DG) means that this fundamental assumption is not true any more. This causes several challenges to network design and operation. One {{of the most critical}} affected areas is system protection. The impact of DG on protection has been examined in several research papers during the last years. The most challenging issue seems to be anti-islanding protection, especially when <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> is applied. In this paper, the effect of DG on <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> is studied. After a short literature review, the method and results of simulation studies are presented. The simulations verify the existence of the problems. Protection requirements and possible solutions are discussed. Because of speed and reliability requirements, telecommunication based protection seems to be the most suitable solution, when the share of DG becomes significant.

Consequently, improper reclosing of the line onto a fault is avoided. The fault identification prior to reclosing is based on optimized artificial neural network associated with three different training algorithms. In addition, Taguchi s methodology is employed in optimizing parameters that significantly influence during and post-training performance of the neural network. A comparison of overall performance of the three algorithms, developed and coded in MATLABTM software environment, is also presented.

40|$|In {{the last}} twenty years the Distributed Generation (DG) {{increased}} till a high level that introduced several issues to the classical management system of distribution networks. In many countries different technical rules have been introduced in order to integrate the DG units in the medium voltage (MV) and low voltage (LV) distribution network. New standards state requirements for all generators, included inverter based ones, imposing a Fault Ride Through (FRT) philosophy and new active and reactive power regulation actions with the aim of maintaining the transmission system stability at the level it was with traditional rotating generators, or even increasing it. These technical rules may not be fully compliant with the <b>automatic</b> <b>reclosing</b> cycle usually performed from the CB at the beginning of MV feeders and/or with the automatic selection procedure of faulty section selection and supply restore to healthy ones. In this paper the effects of DG units connected at MV and LV voltage level in relation to different fault conditions are analysed.

A novel method is proposed in the paper to adaptively optimize the <b>automatic</b> line <b>reclosing</b> time after a transient fault for enhancement of interconnected power system transient stability. Both the study on the transient energy over network and the structure-preserving multi-machines power system model illustrate that the excessive convergence of potential energy on the lines with a certain cutset deteriorate power system stability, and therefore, an optimum line reclosing strategy can be established by minimizing the change in transient potential energy distribution across a cutset lines {{in the vicinity of}} the faulty line as an optimization target, and the optimal reclosure time is set to the time of minimum line phase angle difference. Without any pre-determined knowledge, the method is adaptive to various power system operation modes and fault conditions, and easy to implement because only a limited number of data measured at one location on a tie-line linking sub-networks are required.

40|$|Conventional {{recloser}} {{stresses the}} circuit with current fault {{every time they}} reclose into a fault. After clearing a fault, a conventional recloser simply recloses the interrupters to continuously test {{the presence of the}} fault. If the fault is still there, the interrupters are tripped again. Then, after a time delay, the interrupters are reclosed. During <b>reclosing</b> operation of <b>Automatic</b> <b>Recloser,</b> including the faster recloser one, powerful transient processes occurs and significant amount of energy is feeding the fault, resulting in system-damaging and voltage sags. Replacing conventional recloser with PulseCloser one minimizes these effects and creates the possibility to use multiple reclosing even when traditional autoreclosing can not be allowed. PulseCloser Technology drastically reduces overcurrent stress on the system. Once the PulseCloser interrupts a fault, it sends the impulses to intelligently tests for current fault before reclosing. The relative let-through energy of a pulseclosing operation is typically less than 2 % of a conventional reclosing operation. Pulseclosing is superior to conventional reclosing. It greatly reduces stress on system components as well as voltage sags experienced by customers’ upstream fault. This paper analyzes transient processes during simulation of operation of traditional recloser and PulseCloser type. Simulations are performed using ATP software. The simulations show the remarkable difference in current versus time during fault testing in the transmission line equipped with conventional recloser and PulseCloser.

In case of necessity to implement the rapid transfer of the reactor from one quasi-steady-state mode to another one, the scheme of overexcitation/underexcitation is realized. In such case, time to gain full power starting from no-load condition is reduced up to 0,3 s. Constructively, it is possible to ensure every speed of the reactor power variation. However, based on practical experience of MCSR application, the optimal balance between the reactor operating speed and capacity of biasing system has been determined: speed of power increase/relief within 0,3 - 1,0 s, capacity of biasing system - 1 - 2% of the reactor rated capacity.
