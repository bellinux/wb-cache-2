50|$|The inner six {{are those}} {{who responded to the}} Schuman Declaration's call for the pooling of coal and steel {{resources}} under a common High Authority. The six signed the Treaty of Paris creating the European Coal and Steel Community on 18 April 1951 (which came into force on 23 July 1952). Following on from this, they attempted to create a European Defence Community: with the idea of allowing West Germany to rearm under the authority of a common European military command, a treaty was signed in 1952. However the plan was rejected by the Senate of France, which also scuppered the draft treaty for a European Political Community (which would have created a political federation to ensure democratic control over the new European army). President of the <b>ECSC</b> <b>High</b> <b>Authority,</b> and architect of the ECSC, Jean Monnet resigned in protest and began work on a new plan concentrating on economic fields.|$|E

25|$|The 1957 Treaties of Rome {{established}} two new communities, the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). These {{shared the}} Assembly and Court of the ECSC but created two new sets of Councils and Commissions (equivalent to the <b>ECSC's</b> <b>High</b> <b>Authority).</b> Discussions on the seats {{of the institutions}} were left till the last moment before the treaties came into force, {{so as not to}} interfere with ratification.|$|R
5|$|The {{institutions}} of the <b>ECSC</b> were the <b>High</b> <b>Authority,</b> the Common Assembly, the Special Council of Ministers and the Court of Justice. A Consultative Committee was established alongside the <b>High</b> <b>Authority,</b> as a fifth institution representing civil society. This was the first international representation of consumers in history. These institutions were merged in 1967 {{with those of the}} European Community, which then governed the ECSC, except for the Committee, which continued to be independent until the expiration of the Treaty of Paris in 2002.|$|R
50|$|The {{outcome of}} the conference was that the new Communities would share the Common Assembly (now the Parliamentary Assembly) with the ECSC, as they would the European Court of Justice. However, they would not share the <b>ECSC's</b> Council of <b>High</b> <b>Authority.</b> The two new <b>High</b> <b>Authorities</b> would be called Commissions, from a {{reduction}} in their powers. France was reluctant to agree to more supranational powers; hence, the new Commissions would have only basic powers, and important decisions {{would have to be}} approved by the Council (of national Ministers), which now adopted majority voting. Euratom fostered co-operation in the nuclear field, at the time a very popular area, and the European Economic Community was to create a full customs union between members.|$|R
5000|$|When Robert Schuman {{launched}} {{his plan to}} create a common European market for coal and steel, Luxembourg was a party to this. On 18 April 1951, the Luxembourgish Minister for Foreign Affairs, Joseph Bech, signed the treaty setting up the European Coal and Steel Community, with his French, German, Italian, Belgian and Dutch colleagues. Even though, at the time, the French ambassador remarked that [...] "Luxembourg could not not join" [...] due to its lack of political clout on the international scene, the Luxembourgish government did not agree lightly to a scheme that put the main industry of the country under a supranational authority. After the war, the steel industry remained {{the driving force of}} the Luxembourgish economy. It employed a quarter of the active population, and provided almost two-thirds of the country's industrial production. During the negotiations, the Luxembourgish government succeeded in establishing the principle of the juridical equality of all the states, even the smallest, and in having Luxembourg being directly represented in the institutions of the <b>ECSC,</b> namely the <b>High</b> <b>Authority</b> and the Common Assembly.|$|R

50|$|The Spaak Report {{drawn up}} by the Spaak Committee {{provided}} the basis for further progress and was accepted at the Venice Conference (29 and 30 May 1956) where the decision was taken to organize an Intergovernmental Conference. The report formed the cornerstone of the Intergovernmental Conference on the Common Market and Euratom at Val Duchesse in 1956. The outcome of the conference was that new communities would share the Common Assembly (now Parliamentary Assembly) with the ECSC, as it would with the Court of Justice. However they would not share the <b>ECSC's</b> Council of <b>High</b> <b>Authority.</b> The two new <b>High</b> <b>Authorities</b> would be called Commissions, this was due to a reduction in their powers. France was reluctant to agree to more supranational powers and hence the new Commissions would only have basic powers and important decisions would have to be approved by the Council, which now adopted majority voting. Thus, on 25 March 1957, the Treaties of Rome were signed. They came into force on 1958-01-01 establishing the European Economic Community (EEC) and the European Atomic Energy Community (Euratom). The latter body fostered co-operation in the nuclear field, at the time a very popular area, and the EEC was to create a full customs union between members. Louis Armand became the first President of Euratom Commission and Walter Hallstein became the first President of the EEC Commission.|$|R
