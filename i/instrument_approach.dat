5|$|On March 29, 2001, a {{chartered}} Gulfstream III business jet, {{operated by}} Avjet Corporation, {{crashed into the}} ground while on <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> to Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, Colorado. All three crew members and fifteen passengers on board perished.|$|E
5|$|As {{the flight}} {{approached}} Aspen–Pitkin County Airport, it became evident {{that some of}} the other inbound flights were performing missed approaches, as they had been unable to complete an <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> to the airport's runway. The airport is surrounded by high terrain on all sides and a fairly steep descent is required in order to land.|$|E
5|$|The National Transportation Safety Board (NTSB) {{concluded}} that the crash {{was caused by the}} captain's improper execution of an <b>instrument</b> <b>approach,</b> combined with a severe downdraft at a low altitude, which resulted in the aircraft descending uncontrollably into terrain.|$|E

50|$|The FD is {{generally}} used in direct {{connection with the}} Autopilot (AP), where the FD commands the AP to put the aircraft in the attitude necessary to follow a trajectory. The FD/AP combination is typically used in autopilot coupled low <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches</b> (below 200 feet AGL), or CAT II and CAT III ILS <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches.</b>|$|R

5|$|At 18:56:06 MST, {{the flight}} was cleared for the VOR/DME-C <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> to the airport, whereupon it {{proceeded}} to the Red Table VOR, executed a sequence of designated step-down maneuvers and began final approach to the runway. As it continued its descent past the missed approach point– where the runway must be in sight to continue– the pilots had still not visually located the runway in the increasing darkness and snow showers. At 19:01:57 MST, while in a steep left bank, the aircraft crashed into the terrain, killing all 18 persons on board.|$|E
5|$|In {{a typical}} LFR <b>instrument</b> <b>{{approach}}</b> procedure, final approach would begin {{over the range}} station, with a turn to a specific course. The pilot would descend to a specified minimum descent altitude (MDA), and if the airport was not in sight within a specified time (based on ground speed), a missed approach procedure would be initiated. In the depicted Joliet, IL LFR approach procedure, minimum descent altitude could be as low as 300 feet AGL, and required minimum visibility one mile, depending on aircraft type.|$|E
5|$|The {{aircraft}} {{took off}} from Jacksonville International Airport, Florida, several hours before the accident, although the departure from Jacksonville was delayed by poor weather over New York {{and the removal of}} the baggage of a passenger who decided not to board the jet. The <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> landing was uneventful and the jet was not significantly delayed while in the air waiting to land, however congestion on the taxiways at LaGuardia delayed the arrival of the aircraft at the gate.|$|E
50|$|Practicing <b>{{instrument}}</b> <b>approaches</b> {{can be done}} {{either in}} the instrument meteorological conditions or in visual meteorological conditions - in the latter case, a safety pilot is required so that the pilot practicing <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches</b> can wear a view-limiting device which restricts his field of view to the instrument panel. A safety pilot's primary duty is to observe and avoid other traffic.|$|R
50|$|The {{crosswind}} runway 16-34 is 6004 ft long by 150 ft {{wide and}} each end has GPS-based <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{airport is}} served by four <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches,</b> {{including}} an RNAV (GPS) approach to both runway 4 and 22.|$|R
25|$|Approach and {{departure}} corridors lie over largely {{rural and}} industrial areas, although the <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> path (from the south) passes near the New South Wales suburb of Jerrabomberra, {{the city of}} Queanbeyan, and the Royal Australian Navy base, HMAS Harman, which has some barracks and housing.|$|E

25|$|San Martin Airport has one <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> {{procedure}} {{approved and}} published by the FAA. The RNAV (GPS) RWY 32 approach is documented for normal and circling approaches using RNAV or GPS guidance with 1200' MDA and 1 1/4 mile visibility minimums. Currently the RNAV (GPS) RWY 32 approach is not approved for use at night. The airport is equipped with pilot controlled lighting.|$|E
25|$|The {{crash site}} was within {{international}} waters, but the National Transportation Safety Board carried out an investigation, {{which was published}} on July 1, 1970. The report stated the probable cause as improper crew resource management and stated that the aircraft was fully capable of carrying out the approach and landing. The aircraft was conducting an <b>instrument</b> <b>approach,</b> but was following an unauthorized back course approach.|$|E
25|$|Delta Air Lines Flight 723 was a Douglas DC-9 {{twin-engine}} jetliner, {{operating as}} a scheduled domestic passenger flight from Burlington, Vermont to Logan International Airport in Boston, Massachusetts, with an intermediate stop in Manchester, New Hampshire. On July 31, 1973 at 11:08AM, while on an ILS <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> into Logan in low clouds and fog, the aircraft descended below the glidepath, struck a seawall with a landing gear and crashed, killing {{all but two}} of its 89 occupants. Both survivors later died of their injuries.|$|E

50|$|Before {{satellite}} navigation {{was available for}} civilian aviation, the requirement for large land-based navigation aid (NAVAID) facilities generally limited the use of <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches</b> to land-based (i.e. asphalt, gravel, turf, ice) runways (and those on aircraft carriers). GNSS technology allows, at least theoretically, to create <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches</b> to any point on the Earth's surface (whether on land or water); consequently, there are nowadays examples of water aerodromes (such as Rangeley Lake Seaplane Base in Maine, United States) that have GNSS-based approaches.|$|R
25|$|The time of {{departure}} for the accident flight was from Sorong to Kaimana at 12:45 P.M and estimated arrival at 13:54 P.M with the Second in Command (SIC) as Pilot Flying (PF) and the Pilot in Command (PIC) as Pilot Monitoring (PM). The aircraft dispatch release from Sorong indicated that the flight was planned under the Instrument Flight Rules (IFR). The destination, Kaimana, had no published <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> procedure. Terminal area operations, including approach and landing, were required to be conducted under the Visual Flight Rules (VFR).|$|E
25|$|Upon {{receiving}} clearance, a non-standard terminology {{was used}} by air-traffic control. As {{he did not have}} authorization to use a localizer back-course approach, the captain should have requested a different approach. Instead, the crew opted to conduct a VOR approach without informing air-traffic control. Neither pilot had carried out <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> and landing at runway 07R, making them less familiar with this than their commonly used Runway 25. Another factor was that the SAS aircraft was forced to operate at the lowest-permissible safe speeds while closing in on the Cessna.|$|E
25|$|Ansett New Zealand Flight 703 was an Ansett New Zealand {{scheduled}} {{passenger transport}} flight from Auckland Airport to Palmerston North. On 9 June 1995, the de Havilland Canada Dash 8 aircraft flying this route crashed into hilly terrain in the Tararua Ranges, 16km east of Palmerston North airport, during an <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> in bad weather. The aircraft was carrying 18 passengers and three crew members. All passengers were New Zealand citizens {{except for one}} United States citizen. The flight attendant and three passengers {{died as a result}} of the crash.|$|E
50|$|During 1893 French {{scientist}} Jules Richard constructed sounding balloons. These unmanned balloons, carrying light, {{but very}} precise <b>instruments,</b> <b>approached</b> {{an altitude of}} 50,000 feet (15,240 meters).|$|R
40|$|A piloted {{simulation}} {{study was}} conducted to evaluate the effect on instrument landing system tracking performance of integrating localizer error rate information with the raw localizer error display. The resulting display was named the pseudo command tracking indicator (PCTI) because it provides an indication of any changes of heading required to track the localizer. Eight instrument-rated pilots each flew five <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches</b> with the PCTI and five <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches</b> with a conventional course deviation indicator. The results show good overall pilot acceptance of the PCTI and a significant reduction in localizer tracking error...|$|R

25|$|On Sunday, January 6, 1946, a Pennsylvania Central Airlines Douglas DC-3 (registration NC21786), flying as Flight 105 {{originating}} in New York City with stops in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania and Knoxville, Tennessee, crashed {{while attempting to}} make an <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> to Runway 18 at Birmingham Municipal Airport (now Birmingham-Shuttlesworth International Airport) in Birmingham, Alabama. The plane crashed into Village Creek {{at the south end}} of runway 18-36. The captain, first officer, and a check airman who occupied the cockpit jump seat perished in the crash; several passengers were injured, none fatally.|$|E
25|$|On July 10, 1991, a L'Express Airlines Beechcraft C99, flying as Flight 508 {{originating}} in New Orleans, and in transit from Mobile to Birmingham, crashed {{while attempting to}} make an ILS approach to Runway 5 (since renumbered to Runway 6) at Birmingham Municipal Airport (now Birmingham–Shuttlesworth International Airport) in Birmingham, Alabama. The plane crashed in the Fairview area near Five Points West in the Ensley neighborhood and subsequently injured four persons on the ground, as well as destroying two homes. Of the 15 occupants on board, there were 13 fatalities. The cause of the crash was attributed to the captain's decision to attempt an <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> into severe thunderstorms resulting {{in a loss of}} control of the airplane. To date it is the deadliest commercial aviation accident in Alabama history.|$|E
25|$|The first non-fatal {{incident}} was on 30 October 1961. It involved a BUA mainline Vickers Viscount 736 (registration: G-AODH operating an internal German charter flight {{under contract to}} BEA from Berlin Tempelhof Airport to Frankfurt Rhein-Main Airport. While executing a missed approach during an <b>instrument</b> <b>approach</b> to Rhein-Main Airport in poor visibility, the aircraft crash-landed. It struck the ground alongside Rhein-Main's runway 25 and rolled to a stop. There aircraft was damaged beyond repair, {{but there were no}} fatalities among the 16 occupants (four crew and 12 passengers) although a flight attendant and a passenger sustained injuries. Accident investigators concluded that the crash-landing was caused by the captain flying below the critical height in inadequate surface visibility. They furthermore concluded that the assistance the captain received from his co-pilot at the critical moment was erroneous and misleading, and therefore constituted an important contributing factor.|$|E
5000|$|Corporate Flight Management {{provides}} Fixed-Base Operator {{services for}} the airport. JWN has 120 T-hangars, plus 21,000 sq ft and 19,000 sq ft box hangars that include offices. Aircraft parking and apron space totals 360,000 sq ft, which can accommodate 55 tie-down aircraft. The airport has a precision <b>instrument</b> landing <b>approach</b> into Runway 20. Both Runways 2 and 20 have non-precision <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches.</b>|$|R
5000|$|The {{lack of a}} VHF {{omnidirectional}} range (VOR) beacon at {{the airport}} poses an issue, as few aircraft have appropriate GPS systems to enable non-precision <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches</b> in bad weather.|$|R
50|$|There {{are three}} {{non-precision}} <b>instrument</b> <b>approaches</b> available: a Global Positioning System (GPS) approach to runway 33, a non-directional beacon (NDB) approach to runway 21, and a localizer approach to runway 15.|$|R
