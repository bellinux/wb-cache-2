5000|$|The {{librarian}} {{looks at}} the physical <b>edge-notched</b> <b>card,</b> and notes the number of holes N in each card. (If N >= R, then we could use the [...] "obvious way" [...] mentioned above—the whole point of Zato coding is that it works even when N is much less than R).|$|E
50|$|In {{the late}} 1890s, <b>edge-notched</b> <b>cards</b> were invented, which allowed for easy sorting of data {{by means of}} a {{needle-like}} tool. These <b>edge-notched</b> <b>cards</b> were phased out in the 1980s in favor of computer databases, and they are no longer sold.|$|R
50|$|Before the {{widespread}} use of computers, some public libraries used a system of small <b>edge-notched</b> <b>cards</b> in paper pockets in the back of library books to keep track of them.|$|R
50|$|The use of {{keywords}} {{as part of}} {{an identification}} and classification system long predates computers. Paper data storage devices, notably <b>edge-notched</b> <b>cards,</b> that permitted classification and sorting by multiple criteria were already in use prior to the twentieth century, and faceted classification has been used by libraries since the 1930s.|$|R

50|$|<b>Edge-notched</b> <b>cards</b> are an {{obsolete}} technology used to store {{a small amount}} of binary or logical data, encoded into {{the presence or absence of}} notches in the edges of paper index cards. The notches allowed efficient sorting and selecting of specific cards matching desired criteria, from a larger number of cards in a paper-based database of information.|$|R
5000|$|Some {{kinds of}} {{superimposed}} code {{can be seen}} as a Bloom filter implemented with physical <b>edge-notched</b> <b>cards.</b> An example is Zatocoding, invented by Calvin Mooers in 1947, in which the set of categories associated with a piece of information is represented by notches on a card, with a random pattern of four notches for each category.|$|R
5000|$|In 1959, Ledley and Lusted {{published}} “Reasoning Foundations of Medical Diagnosis,” {{a widely}} read article in Science, which introduced operations research techniques to medical workers. Areas covered included: symbolic logic, Bayes’ theorem (probability), and value theory. In the article, physicians were instructed {{how to create}} diagnostic databases using <b>edge-notched</b> <b>cards</b> {{to prepare for a}} time when they would have the opportunity to enter their data into electronic computers for analysis. [...] Ledley and Lusted expressed hope that by harnessing computers, much of physicians’ work would become automated and that many human errors could therefore be avoided.|$|R
40|$|This {{bibliography}} contains 155 English- language {{items of}} literature on the mechanization of library processes. These processes include acquisitions, circulation control, handling of serials, selection of document copies, and intercommunication between libraries. Mechanized information retrieval is not included, i. e., subject searching by machine. Further, the common uses of data processing by libraries for such functions as payroll and accounting are not included. Mechanized equipment includes punched- card accounting machines, computers, automatic typewriters, or automatic selection devices. All these devices involve machine -usable file media such as punched cards, magnetic tape, and punched paper tape. Thus ordinary typewriters and reproduction devices are not included. The use of <b>edge-notched</b> <b>cards</b> is also not included. published or submitted for publicatio...|$|R
50|$|To allow {{a visual}} check that all cards in a deck were {{oriented}} the same way, {{one corner of}} each card was beveled, much like Hollerith punched <b>cards.</b> <b>Edge-notched</b> <b>cards,</b> however, were {{not intended to be}} read by machines. Instead, they were manipulated by passing one or more slim needles through selected holes in a group of cards. As the needles were lifted, the cards that were notched in the hole positions where the needles were inserted would be left behind as rest of the deck was lifted by the needles. Using two or more needles produced a logical and function. Combining the cards from two different selections produced a logical or. Quite complex manipulations, including sorting were possible using these techniques.|$|R
5000|$|He was a {{participant}} in early developmental work on digital computers, a researcher, author, and implementer of applications in information retrieval; and a prophet in the 1950s describing the future importance {{of what is now}} called computer networks and distributive processing, and daring to predict that machines could simulate thought processes in retrieving computerized information. In 1947, he proposed the Zator, an electronic, film-scanning retrieval machine, and made the first proposal to use the Boolean operations or, and, and not to prescribe selections in retrieval machines. He developed his own Zatocoding System in 1948 using superimposed subject codes on <b>edge-notched</b> <b>cards.</b> He coined the term [...] "Information Retrieval" [...] in 1950, and went on from there to obtain several patents in information retrieval and signaling, produce a [...] (TRAC), author some 200 publications, and form one of the first companies whose only concern was information. His thinking has affected all who are in the field of Information and his early ideas are now incorporated into today's reality.|$|R
