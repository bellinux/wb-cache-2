40|$|A {{calibrated}} {{groundwater flow}} {{model for a}} contaminated site can provide substantial information for assessing and improving <b>hydraulic</b> <b>measures</b> implemented for remediation. A three-dimensional transient groundwater flow model was developed for a contaminated mountainous site, at which interim corrective measures were initiated to limit further spreading of contaminants. This flow model accounts for complex geologic units that vary considerably in thickness, slope, and hydrogeologic properties, as well as large seasonal fluctuations of the groundwater table and flow rates. Other significant factors are local recharge from leaking underground storm drains and recharge from steep uphill areas. The zonation method was employed {{to account for the}} clustering of high and low hydraulic conductivities measured in a geologic unit. A composite model was used to represent the bulk effect of thin layers of relatively high hydraulic conductivity found within bedrock of otherwise low conductivity. The inverse simulator ITOUGH 2 was used to calibrate the model for the distribution of rock properties. The model was initially calibrated using data collected between 1994 and 1996. To check the validity of the model, it was subsequently applied to predicting groundwater level fluctuation and groundwater flux between 1996 and 1998. Comparison of simulated and measured data demonstrated that the model is capable of predicting the complex flow reasonably well. Advective transport was approximated using pathways of particles originating from source areas of the plumes. The advective transport approximation was in good agreement with the trend of contaminant plumes observed over the years. The validated model was then refined to focus on a subsection of the large system.

40|$|Understanding the {{interactions}} between the ecosystem and the morphology of river floodplains, i. e. floodplain biogeomorphology, is becoming increasingly important in view of modern river management and climate change. There {{is a need for}} predictive models for the natural response of river floodplains to <b>hydraulic</b> <b>measures</b> and river rehabilitation, such as river widening, construction of secondary channels and floodplain lowering. This thesis investigates floodplain biogeomorphology from a modeller's perspective. It addresses management concepts such as room-for-the-river and cyclic floodplain rejuvenation, in which a symbiosis is sought for between flood management and nature rehabilitation, and it shows how 1 -D, 2 -D and 3 -D numerical models can be used to support them. Its main focus is on one of the knowledge gaps emerging from these model applications, viz. the effect of floodplain vegetation on the bed shear stress and subsequent bedload sediment transport. By means of a combination of theory development, flume experiments and field work, this research has resulted into a number of practically applicable and validated formulations for the hydraulic resistance and bed shear stress reduction of vegetation. These can be applied in large-scale numerical morphodynamic models to better design river measures in combination with nature rehabilitation. Civil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|E

The published article is copyrighted by Springer {{and can be found}} at: [URL] of large wood for expanding hydraulic variability is an increasingly common practice, yet it is not yet known what elements of hydraulic variability are most beneficial to fish. In an experiment designed to emphasize the minimization of energy expenditure through controlled predation and drift, we investigated whether juvenile coho, under winter conditions, discriminated between microhabitats based primarily on flow strength, depth, distance to wood, or based on temporal or spatial variability of the flow field, with the hypothesis that turbulence would be a strong factor in habitat selection. We conducted physical experiments in a 1 : 1 scale model of a large wood jam at the Oregon Hatchery Research Center in Alsea, Oregon. We conducted high resolution (0. 1 m) mapping of the flow field using an acoustic Doppler velocimeter array and underwater videogrammetry of fish locations. Results indicated that discrimination of microhabitats by juvenile coho salmon in cold, low flows emphasized depth and distance to wood over any <b>hydraulic</b> <b>measures</b> of the flow field. Correlations between hydraulic parameters and distance to wood limited our ability to distinguish the importance of turbulence measures relative to velocities, but highlighted the positive relationships between velocity and turbulence measures and the negative relationships between hydraulics and distance from the roughness elements.

40|$|The hyporheic zone is {{intrinsic}} to river ecosystems. Nutrient breakdown rates in shallow riverine sediment occur at rates faster than in marine sediments. This means that where water exchanges between stream and substrate, key alterations occur to {{the chemistry of}} sediment pore waters and lower river water column. A river unit’s hydrogeomorphological setting and spatial configuration is linked to exchange flow generation between terrestrial and aquatic ecotones – a hyporheic flow pathway. Hydrological process connectivity occurs at scales from valley-scale enclosures through to meanders and riverbed forms, such as pool-riffles. Together, the hyporheic pathways coupled with the surface turbulent oxygenation processes in riffle flow, are significant in altering river water chemistry over short distances. This is considered vital, as the central focus of the European Union Water Framework Directive (2000 / 60 /EC (EU WFD) is to achieve good ecological status, hyporheic processes significantly contribute to this. In this thesis bio-indicator species abundance, {{in the form of}} Margaritifera margaritifera Linnaeus (1758), an oligotrophic bivalve, is investigated as having an affinity with hyporheic processes.

40|$|A {{pilot hole}} test was {{conducted}} to support {{the design of the}} Degassing of Groundwater and Two-Phase Flow experiments planned for the Hard Rock Laboratory, Aespoe, Sweden. The test consisted of a sequence of constant pressure borehole inflow tests (CPTs) and pressure recovery tests (PRTs) in borehole KA 2512 A. The test sequence was designed to detect degassing effects from the change in transmissivity, or hydraulic conductivity, and storativity when the borehole pressure is lowered below the groundwater bubble pressure. The entire 37. 3 m of the borehole section was tested without packers. Flow response to pressure changes in CPTs occurred rapidly. Flowrates fluctuated before attaining a steady trend, probably due to effective stress changes when borehole pressure was reduced for the first time. These factors decreased the sensitivity of type-curve fits to values of specific storage. The relationship between borehole pressure and steady-state flowrates was linear over borehole pressures of 1500 kPa (abs) down to 120 kPa (abs) during testing in December 1994, indicating that processes that may change hydraulic conductivity at low borehole pressures, such as degassing, calcite precipitation or turbulence, did not occur to a measurable degree. Test results during January and February of 1995 suggest that degassing may have occurred. The <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity <b>measured</b> at a borehole pressure equal to 120 kPa (abs) was 20 % lower than the <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity <b>measured</b> at a borehole pressure of 1500 kPa (abs); the latter value was 10 % lower than the <b>hydraulic</b> conductivity <b>measured</b> in December, 1994.

40|$|Besides {{tetrachloroethene}} (PCE) and trichloroethene (TCE) also 1, 1, 1 -trichloroethane (TCA) is {{an important}} contaminant. The results of the analytical monitoring of <b>hydraulic</b> <b>measures</b> at a contaminated site revealed that the concentrations of PCE and TCE are lowered by natural attenuation whereas TCA was recalcitrant. In the R and D-project a technology for the microbial in-situ dagradation of VCH was developed with emphasis {{on the degradation of}} TCA. Under anaerobic conditions a complete comatabolic degradation of TCA could be achieved. 1, 1 -Dichloroethane (DCA) was the only observed metabolite. Chloroethane did not accumulate. The used auxiliar substrat was a mixtur of acetate and formiate or molasses. The transitions of the single environmental phases, 'anaerobaerob' may principally enhance the degradation of the VCH. However, the investigations showed no significant aerobic transformation of TCA or DCA. Methane which may serve as inductor for the aerobic degradation of the VCH is produced under anaerobic conditions. However, the concentrations were not high enough, so that after transition to aerobic conditions the aerobic degradation could not be induced. Although these anaerobic/aerobic transitions are easily to realize for biochemical reasons, they require high amounts of supplements. Because the degradation in in-situ-technologies is limited by mass transfer, no degradation kinetics compared to bioreactors are required. The mineralization of VCH under anerobic conditions is therefore preferable. An extensive monitoring may help to prevent process specific problems (CH_ 4 -gas bubbles, clogging by biomass). An aerobic post-treatment may further improve the quality of the groundwater. (orig.)

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research is}} to make a general framework, that when run through one can find a suitable measure to make a particular area in Myanmar flood proof. Myanmar suffers from yearly floods that have a huge impact on the population. Making an area flood proof is therefore one of the objectives of the civilian government. In this report ‘flood proof’ is defined as a status that shows that an area is prepared to control the effects of a flood. To achieve this goal a general framework has been created. This general framework guides the reader through multiple analyses, a development of alternatives, an assessment and an implementation. It has the objective to be transparent, reproducible, elementary, based on existing methods and based on data. To test this general framework on these criteria two cases with different research areas are chosen namely, case I: Nyaungdon and case II: Dala. The report is therefore developed as an incremental and iterative process. In this report a range of alternatives has been taken into account, that includes more than only the <b>hydraulic</b> <b>measures.</b> To implement the Dutch method of treating a (potential) flood a multi-layer safety approach has been used. This approach consist of three layers namely, prevention, spatial solutions and crisis management. All the alternatives of this report can be classified into one of these layers. The analysis phase of the general framework has been focussed on four specific analyses. The four specific analyses are a flood risk analysis, an actor analysis, an evacuation analysis, and a future scenario analysis. These analyses combined with the general analyses lead to the development of alternatives. The method that has been used to determine the relatively best alternative is the multi-criteria analysis. Most of the time it is preferred to combine several alternatives in packages to generate the best possible solutions. After these solution packages have been created for every research area an implementation has been done including an adaptive strategy. The data that has been used in this project is gathered by interviewing experts, conducting surveys and reading reports and researches. Due to a lack of data, a lot of assumptions have been made.

40|$|Aortic Valve Analysis and Area Prediction using Bayesian Modeling Miheer S. Ghotikar ABSTRACT Aortic valve {{stenosis}} affects approximately 5 out {{of every}} 10, 000 people in the United States. [3] This disorder causes decrease in the aortic valve opening area increasing resistance to blood flow. Detection of early stages of valve malfunction is an important area of research to enable new treatments and develop strategies in order to delay degenerative progression. Analysis of relationship between valve properties and hemodynamic factors is critical to develop and validate these strategies. Porcine aortic valves are anatomically analogous to human aortic valves. Fixation agents modify the valves {{in such a manner}} to mimic increased leaflet stiffness due to early degeneration. In this study, porcine valves treated with glutaraldehyde, a cross-linking agent and ethanol, a dehydrating agent were used to alter leaflet material properties. The hydraulic performance of ethanol and glutaraldehyde treated valves was compared to fresh valves using a programmable pulse duplicator that could simulate physiological conditions. Hydraulic conditions in the pulse duplicator were modified by varying mean flow rate and mean arterial pressure. Pressure drops across the aortic valve, flow rate and back pressure (mean arterial pressure) values were recorded at successive instants of time. Corresponding values of pressure gradient were measured, while aortic valve opening area was obtained from photographic data. Effects of glutaradehyde cross-linking and ethanol dehydration on the aortic valve area for different hydraulic conditions that emulated hemodynamic physiological conditions were analyzed and it was observed that glutaradehyde and ethanol fixation causes changes in aortic valve opening and closing patterns. Next, relations between material properties, experimental conditions, and <b>hydraulic</b> <b>measures</b> of valve performance were studied using a Bayesian model approach. The primary hypothesis tested in this study was that a Bayesian network could be used to predict dynamic changes in the aortic valve area given the hemodynamic conditions. A Bayesian network encodes probabilistic relationships among variables of interest, also representing causal relationships between temporal antecedents and outcomes. A Learning Bayesian Network was constructed; direct acyclic graphs were drawn in GeNIe 2. 0 Ê¾ using an information theory dependency algorithm. Mutual Information was calculated between every set of parameters. Conditional probability tables and cut-sets were obtained from the data with the use of MatlabÊ¾. A Bayesian model was built for predicting dynamic values of opening and closing area for fresh, ethanol fixed and glutaradehyde fixed aortic valves for a set of hemodynamic conditions. Separate models were made for opening and closing cycles. The models predicted aortic valve area for fresh, ethanol fixed and glutaraldehyde fixed valves. As per the results obtained from the model, it can be concluded that the Bayesian network works successfully with the performance of porcine valves in a pulse duplicator. Further work would include building the Bayesian network with additional parameters and patient data for predicting aortic valve area of patients with progressive stenosis. The important feature would be to predict valve degenration based on valve opening or closing pattern...|$|E

40|$|Multiobjective {{optimization}} {{is becoming}} an increasingly important approach for both the design and operation of water distribution systems (WDSs). Given the multiobjective nature of these problems, multiobjective optimization is expected to provide decision makers with increased insight into the tradeoffs between competing objectives and alternative solutions of WDSs, which might benefit the water industry, society and environment. Due to the advances in computing technology {{and the development of}} fast multiobjective sorting algorithms, research activities into the application of multiobjective algorithms to WDS design and operation have increased significantly in the past decade. Minimization of economic cost and maximization of network reliability are the two most commonly considered objectives in WDS optimization. In addition, some environment related issues, such as energy conservation, have been incorporated into the optimization of WDSs. However, the leading environmental concern – Greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions – has not yet been addressed directly in the field of WDS optimization. Consequently, this research incorporates GHG emission minimization as an objective directly into the optimal design of WDSs, together with the economic objective of minimizing cost and the hydraulic reliability objective of maximizing surplus power factor via a multiobjective approach. The major research contributions are presented in six journal publications. These publications describe the motivation and methodology to incorporate GHG emission minimization as an objective of WDS optimization; explore the tradeoffs between the traditional objective of minimizing life cycle cost and the environmental objective of minimizing life cycle GHG emissions; investigate the sensitivity of these tradeoffs to a number of factors, including the discount rate, electricity tariffs and emission factors used in the objective function evaluation process, the price of carbon under a potential emissions trading scheme and the use of fixed-speed or variable-speed pumps; and finally examine the impact of the inclusion of the hydraulic reliability objective of maximizing surplus power factor on WDS optimization account for economic cost and GHG emissions. In addition, two technical issues have also been solved in order to achieve the overall research aim. First, an optimization based generic pump power estimation method has been developed in this research to efficiently estimate the size and pump power of the pumps required for different network configurations, thus variable-speed pumps can be incorporated into the optimal design of WDSs. Secondly, a new <b>hydraulic</b> reliability <b>measure</b> based on the concept of surplus power factor has been incorporated into the optimal design of WDSs. The advantage of this <b>hydraulic</b> <b>measure</b> over currently used <b>hydraulic</b> reliability <b>measures</b> is that it can be used for WDSs involving the delivery of water into storage facilities, where other measures have failed. The overall contribution of this research is the incorporation of GHG emission consideration into the design optimization of WDSs together with the traditional economic and reliability objectives via a multiobjective approach. It is anticipated that this research will lead to a new paradigm for the optimization of WDSs in the real world. Thesis (Ph. D.)
