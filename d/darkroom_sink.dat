40|$|Dignity of Labor. " Worker smokes a {{cigarette}} and looks directly toward the camera. Narration by Junebug Clark: This striking studio portrait of a hard working laborer has been widely published. It was hung in every United Auto Worker union hall and other labor unions has used it too. In reality, {{this man is a}} plumber who came into fix a leaking <b>darkroom</b> <b>sink</b> and while he was there my father sat him down for a portrait. It's a family trait - always keep your camera handy and keep shooting. "If your {{going to come back and}} tell me about something you've seen today, bring me back a picture," Joe would often say.
