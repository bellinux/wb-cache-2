5|$|As Singapore is {{a common}} law jurisdiction, <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the courts are {{considered}} a source of law. Judgments may interpret statutes or subsidiary legislation, or develop principles of common law and equity that have been laid down, not by the legislature, but by previous generations of judges. Major portions of Singapore law, particularly contract law, equity and trust law, property law and tort law, are largely judge-made, though certain aspects have now been modified to some extent by statutes.|$|E
5|$|During Straits Settlements times, cases {{pertaining}} to Singapore appeared in various privately produced and official series of law reports such as Kyshe's Reports (covering cases decided between 1808 and 1939), the Straits Law Journal (1839–1891) and the Straits Settlements Law Reports (1867–1942). From 1932 until 1992, Singapore cases appeared {{regularly in the}} Malayan Law Journal (MLJ), the only local series of law reports published continuously since the 1930s, except during World War II. The MLJ is still consulted for Singapore cases decided prior to full independence in 1965. Since 1992, <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the High Court, Court of Appeal and Constitutional Tribunal of Singapore {{have appeared in the}} Singapore Law Reports (SLR), which is published by the Singapore Academy of Law under an exclusive licence from the Supreme Court of Singapore. The Academy has also republished cases decided since Singapore's full independence in 1965 that appeared in the MLJ in special volumes of the SLR, and {{is currently working on a}} reissue of this body of case law. Cases published in the SLR as well as unreported <b>judgments</b> <b>of</b> the Supreme Court and Subordinate Courts are available on-line from a fee-based service called , which is also managed by the Academy.|$|E
