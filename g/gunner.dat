5|$|The Cheyenne had a two-seat tandem cockpit {{featuring}} {{an advanced}} navigation and fire control suite. The tandem seating placed the {{pilot in the}} rear seat, and the <b>gunner</b> in the front seat. An unusual feature of the gunner's station was that the entire seat, sighting system, and firing controls rotated to keep the <b>gunner</b> facing {{the same direction as}} the gun turret being controlled. The gun-sight afforded the <b>gunner</b> direct viewing from the turret by way of a periscope sight. The pilot had a helmet mounted sight system for aiming weapons.|$|E
5|$|The {{layout of}} the He 111Z had the pilot and his {{controls}} in the port fuselage only. The controls themselves and essential equipment were all that remained in the starboard section.

50|$|On August 8, 1934, {{before the}} start of the NFL season, St. Louis {{purchased}} the NFL's Cincinnati Reds for $20,000. However, the <b>Gunners</b> needed the other league owners to approve the sale. Only then would the <b>Gunners</b> would be official members. On August 17, the other owners decided to reject the <b>Gunners</b> bid to buy the Reds, probably because St. Louis was considered to be too remote from the rest of the clubs, most of which were in the Northeast, and yearly trips there would have increased travel expenses. Meanwhile, the <b>Gunners</b> declined membership in the minor league American Football League. As a result, the new league decided to form the St. Louis Blues. <b>Gunners</b> GM Bud Yates was credited with founding the team. The Blues lured Dick Frahm away from the <b>Gunners</b> and even took over the lease of Public Schools Stadium. As a result, the <b>Gunners</b> moved their home games to Sportsman's Park. Meanwhile, Chile Walsh became the team's fourth head coach in four years.|$|R

5|$|A {{number of}} design faults of the Tetrarch were {{revealed}} through its operational use. Its size limited the possible crew to three, a {{driver in the}} hull and a <b>gunner</b> and commander in the turret, resulting in too few crew members to operate the Tetrarch effectively. The <b>gunner</b> or commander, {{in addition to his}} own duties, had to act as loader for the 2 pounder, which caused delays in combat. A report on the tank written in January 1941 stated that as the commander had to both fight and control the tank, controlling a troop of Tetrarchs during combat would be almost impossible.|$|E
5|$|During the Napoleonic Wars, a British gun team {{consisted}} of five gunners to aim it, clean the bore {{with a damp}} sponge to quench any remaining embers before a fresh charge was introduced, and another to load the gun {{with a bag of}} powder and then the projectile. The fourth <b>gunner</b> pressed his thumb on the vent hole, to prevent a draught that might fan a flame. The charge loaded, the fourth would prick the bagged charge through the vent hole, and fill the vent with powder. On command, the fifth <b>gunner</b> would fire the piece with a slowmatch.|$|E

5|$|In the 1770s, cannon {{operation}} {{worked as}} follows: each cannon would be manned by two gunners, six soldiers, and four officers of artillery. The right <b>gunner</b> was to prime the piece and load it with powder, {{and the left}} <b>gunner</b> would fetch the powder from the magazine {{and be ready to}} fire the cannon at the officer's command. On each side of the cannon, three soldiers stood, to ram and sponge the cannon, and hold the ladle. The second soldier on the left tasked with providing 50 bullets.|$|E
5|$|On May 1, 2014, Anderson {{attacked}} James Storm after Storm lost to Willow. On May 22, Anderson challenged Storm to {{a drinking}} contest, {{then went on}} to attack him outside the bar. On June 5 episode of Impact, Anderson impersonated Storm, with Storm's retro entrance music, then attacked Storm after he refused to grant him a match. After Anderson lost the brawl, the match was set at Slammiversary, who was win by Anderson. A Following Slammiversary, Anderson formed a tag team with <b>Gunner</b> but tensions already rose between them because of Gunner's relationship to Samuel Shaw, whom <b>Gunner</b> had been helping through psychiatric counselling. Anderson and <b>Gunner</b> would continue to team together with Shaw at their side who would try to help them in their matches but Anderson refused because of his lack of trust. On the August 14th edition of Impact, Anderson and Shaw finally came to punches during a match between Anderson and <b>Gunner.</b> At Hardcore Justice, Anderson was defeated by Shaw in a I Quit match. On September 17, 2014, Mr. Anderson came to the aid of fellow former Army Sergeant and amputee wrestler Chris Melendez on his debut from a post-match attack by Kenny King.

50|$|The <b>Gunners</b> {{defeated}} {{their first}} NFL opponent, the Pittsburgh Pirates, 6-0. However, {{a week later}} they were defeated by the Detroit Lions 40-7. The team managed to defeat the Pirates again in a 10-0 rematch, but the game, scheduled while the <b>Gunners</b> were still playing independently, was subsequently ruled an exhibition. The <b>Gunners</b> lost to the Packers a week later, 21-14, before dropping another close game to the Dodgers 17-14. The <b>Gunners</b> ended their 1934 season with a 7-0 win over the Kansas City Blues.|$|R
50|$|In US Navy or US Coast Guard service, the craft’s crew {{comprised}} two <b>gunners</b> and the coxswain. Though the <b>gunners</b> {{would normally}} occupy the two <b>gunner's</b> cockpits, forward, during landing, they had other duties also. One acted as the bowman {{while the other}} served as the mechanic. The coswain {{was in charge of}} the boat and crew. His position was at the wheel directly behind the <b>gunner's</b> cockpits and only slightly off-set to the port side. From here he steered and operated engine controls.|$|R
50|$|Most trades {{required}} {{access to}} both bombing and gunnery training, {{but the time}} spent in each section of the school varied depending on the trade. Air <b>Gunners</b> advanced from basic training at a Manning Depot to a 12-week gunnery course at Bombing and Gunnery School. After basic training Wireless Air <b>Gunners</b> went to Wireless School for 28 weeks and then came to Bombing and Gunnery School for a 4-week gunnery course. Air <b>Gunners</b> and Wireless Air <b>Gunners</b> were sent to Operational Training Units after their gunnery course.|$|R

5|$|The M249 is gas {{operated}} and air-cooled. It has a quick-change barrel, allowing the <b>gunner</b> to rapidly replace an overheated or jammed barrel. A folding bipod is attached {{near the front}} of the gun, though an M192 LGM tripod is available. It can be fed from both linked ammunition and STANAG magazines, like those used in the M16 and M4. This allows the SAW <b>gunner</b> to use a rifleman's magazines as an emergency source of ammunition in the event that he runs out of linked rounds.|$|E

5|$|By August 1940 the Battle of Britain was intensifying. Most of {{the battles}} thus far were in daylight, leaving night-fighter crews frustrated. Now based at RAF Digby in Lincolnshire and {{operating}} from the satellite airfield at Wellingore the unit formed part of No. 12 Group RAF defending British air space north of London. On {{the night of}} 24 August 1940 Braham took off and patrolled the Humberside area. The Blenheim was piloted by Braham, and contained air <b>gunner</b> Sergeant Wilsdon and aircraftman and trained radar operator N. Jacobson. Braham was directed to an aircraft held in searchlights but he closed too fast and overshot. His <b>gunner</b> succeeded in damaging the aircraft sufficiently and a searchlight crew saw it crash into the sea. It {{was identified as a}} Heinkel He 111. Braham's only other interaction with the enemy occurred at Ternhill, when a Junkers Ju 88 dropped bombs on the airfield destroying 13 Avro Ansons and damaged 20 more. Braham survived the attack uninjured.|$|E

5|$|Each {{regiment}} and corps has distinctive insignia, {{such as a}} cap badge, beret, tactical recognition flash or stable belt. Many units {{also call}} soldiers of different ranks by different names; a NATO OR-1 (private) is called a guardsman in Guards regiments, a <b>gunner</b> in artillery units and a sapper in engineer units. These names do not affect a soldier's pay or role.|$|E

5|$|Investigation {{revealed}} both {{mechanical and}} organizational {{causes of the}} accident. The chain of events, as it was reconstructed in Toulon, started with {{a failure of the}} hydraulic breech-locking mechanism of the left-hand gun. The turret crew then disabled the hydraulics and resorted to manual operation. The <b>gunner</b> responsible for closing and locking the breech failed to do so and the concussion of the right-hand gun firing unlocked it. The turret commander, ultimately responsible for checking the breech before firing, was too busy with calculating the firing solution and training the gun to be concerned with this matter. He delegated the checkup routine to an enlisted man, but this <b>gunner</b> had to attend his own station and was physically unable to look after the breech lock and attend to his own duties. The panel eventually dropped the charges against the captain and recommended introduction of mechanical fail-safe interlocks to prevent firing until the breech was properly locked.|$|E
5|$|On April 11, 1970, Lance Corporal Emilio A.
