5|$|Water {{supply and}} {{sanitation}} in Zimbabwe {{is defined by}} many small scale successful programs but also by {{a general lack of}} <b>improved</b> water and sanitation systems for the majority of Zimbabwe.

Access to <b>improved</b> water supply and sanitation is distinctly less in rural areas.|$|E

40|$|Stochastic local search (SLS) is the {{dominant}} paradigm for incomplete SAT and MAXSAT solvers. Early studies on small 3 SAT instances found {{that the use of}} “best improving” moves did not <b>improve</b> search compared to using an arbitrary “first <b>improving</b> ” move. Yet SLS algorithms continue to use best <b>improving</b> moves. We revisit this issue by studying very large random and industrial MAXSAT problems. Because locating best <b>improving</b> moves is more expensive than first <b>improving</b> moves, we designed an “approximate best ” <b>improving</b> move algorithm and prove that it is as efficient as first <b>improving</b> move SLS. For industrial problems the first local optima found using best <b>improving</b> moves are statistically significantly better than local optima found using first <b>improving</b> moves. However, this advantage reverses as search continues and algorithms must explore equal moves on plateaus. This reversal appears to be associated with critical variables that are in many clauses and that also yield large <b>improving</b> moves. Local Search for MAXSAT Stochastic local search algorithms have successfully solved large random instances as well as industrial instances of both SAT and MAXSAT. “Best <b>improving</b> ” local search for MAXSAT identifies all of the <b>improving</b> moves in the Hamming distance 1 neighborhood, then uses the best <b>improving</b> move to update the incumbent solution. In contrast, “first <b>improving</b> ” local search arbitrarily selects the first available <b>improving</b> move to update the incumbent solution. Many stochastic local search (SLS) algorithms for MAXSAT can be viewed as having two stages: a greedy stage that uses best <b>improving</b> move local search followed by an exploratory stage that heuristically guides search after plateaus (large regions in the search space in which the majority of moves have the same evaluation) have been encountere...|$|R

5|$|Also, whilst {{productivity}} {{figures have}} <b>improved,</b> median incomes and stock market prices, {{and thus the}} returns to capital and labor, have not <b>improved.</b> Furthermore, government consumption (government activity excluding transfer payments) represents between 15–20% of GDP, but since the sector is measured at cost it becomes less and less productive as it grows larger. Thus, the more government consumption there is, the more published GDP figures tend to overestimate growth in living standards.|$|E

30|$|DALP-TS {{utilizes}} two counters (both initialized to zero) in {{the neighborhood}} selection process: non-improving move count and minor <b>improving</b> move count. DALP-TS increments the non-improving move count value after selecting a non-improving move and resets the value to zero after selecting either type of <b>improving</b> move. Likewise, DALP-TS increments the minor <b>improving</b> move count value after selecting a minor <b>improving</b> move and resets the value to zero after selecting a major <b>improving</b> move; however, after selecting a non-improving move, the minor <b>improving</b> move count does not change. This logic prevents DALP-TS from indefinitely cycling between non-improving and minor <b>improving</b> moves.
