Memorias was dedicated to Fernando Cuadrado, who opposed the monopoly.|$|E
5|$|Hōshō {{was fitted}} with a net used as a crash barrier aft of the forward {{elevator}} between 10 March and 2 July 1925. The barrier was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> landing aircraft from colliding with aircraft preparing to take off, and stop them from falling into the open elevator well. The barrier was hydraulically operated and could be erected in three seconds.|$|E
5|$|In 1757, Lembi Battery {{was added}} near Tigné Point, Sliema. The battery {{was funded by}} the Manoel Foundation and it was {{considered}} to be an outwork of Fort Manoel, since it was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> an enemy from bombarding the fort's northern flank. It was decommissioned following the construction of Fort Tigné in 1795. The construction of the latter fort was also partially funded by the Manoel Foundation.|$|E

5|$|When France {{surrendered}} on 22 June, {{two ships}} were in French Algeria, one was refitting in Toulon {{and the last}} ship was in England. During Operation Catapult in July, {{an attack on the}} Vichy Fleet <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> it from being turned over to the Germans, the British seized the ship in England, but failed to prevent the two in Mers-el-Kébir from escaping to Toulon when they attacked the port.|$|E
5|$|After {{his release}} he {{returned}} to Dorothea's Courland court, where {{he served as a}} tutor for her daughter. Around 1803 he began cooperating with Adam Jerzy Czartoryski, who was now working for the Russian authorities. Around that time, he and Czartoryski authored a plan for a European federal organization of states <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> armed conflicts and to maintain perpetual peace. Piattoli, through Czartoryski, briefly worked in the diplomatic service and administration of the Russians, too. Like Czartoryski, Piattoli tried to push for a more lenient and friendly attitude towards Poland at the Russian court, but with little success.|$|E
5|$|After the Sierra Leone Civil War {{began in}} 1991, the CDC closed their program in Segbwema. Conteh and his medical team moved from Segbwema to the Kenema Government Hospital (KGH), {{where he spent}} the next two decades running the only {{dedicated}} Lassa fever ward in the world. Conteh collaborated with the British charity Merlin to promote public health in Sierra Leone through education and awareness campaigns <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Lassa fever. With little funding and few supplies, Conteh successfully reduced mortality rates and saved many lives until an accidental needlestick injury led to his own death from the disease in 2004.|$|E
50|$|On 21 March 1986, Kurds {{seeking to}} {{celebrate}} the Kurdish-Iranian New Year (Newroz) clashed with state security forces <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> any festivities from occurring.

5|$|At {{the time}} the service was inaugurated, the LNC's trains were divided both by class and by religion, with {{separate}} Anglican and Nonconformist sections of the train. This distinction applied to both living and dead passengers. <b>Intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> persons from different social background from mixing and potentially distressing mourners and to prevent bodies of persons from different social classes being carried in the same compartment rather than to provide different facilities, the carriages intended for all classes and religions were very similar in design, and the primary difference was different ornamentation on the compartment doors.|$|E
5|$|Average wage {{rates in}} the Soviet Union were {{published}} relatively rarely. Some academics in the West believed this was because the Soviet government wanted to conceal low average earnings. Alec Nove wrote in 1966 (when wage statistics were published {{for the first time}} since the Second World War) that the lack of transparency surrounding average wages was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> Soviet workers from discovering the huge disparities that existed between wages in different sectors of the Soviet economy.|$|E
5|$|Due {{to local}} {{conditions}} it was sometimes {{necessary for the}} Commission to deviate from its standard design. In places prone to extreme weather or earthquakes, such as Thailand and Turkey, stone-faced pedestal markers are used instead of the normal headstones. These measures are <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> masonry being damaged during earthquakes or sinking into sodden ground. In Italy, headstones were carved from Chiampo Perla limestone {{because it was in}} more plentiful supply. In Struma Military Cemetery, in Greece, to avoid risk of earthquake damage, small headstones are laid flush to the ground. Due to their smaller size, the markers often lack unit insignia.|$|E

5|$|In May 2006, The Sunday Business Post {{reported}} that Steorn {{was a former}} dot-com company which was developing a microgenerator product {{based on the same}} principle as self-winding watches, as well as creating e-commerce websites for customers. The company had also recently raised about €2.5 million from investors and was three years into a four-year development plan for its microgenerator technology. Steorn later stated that the account given in this interview was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a leak regarding their free energy technology.|$|E
5|$|The {{rear wheel}} pods {{introduced}} to IndyCar in 2012 <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> cars from becoming airborne when hitting {{another in the}} rear proved to be ineffective as there were major crashes resulting from such contact during the 2013 race in Houston involving Dario Franchitti and the 2017 Indianapolis 500 involving Scott Dixon. In addition the pods were often ripped from cars from light contact, placing hazardous debris on the track. As a result the rear pods were eliminated for 2018.|$|E
5|$|After {{completing}} {{sea trials}} in early 1941, Tirpitz briefly {{served as the}} centrepiece of the Baltic Fleet, which was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a possible break-out attempt by the Soviet Baltic Fleet. In early 1942, the ship sailed to Norway {{to act as a}} deterrent against an Allied invasion. While stationed in Norway, Tirpitz was also intended to be used to intercept Allied convoys to the Soviet Union, and two such missions were attempted in 1942. This was the only feasible role for her, since the St Nazaire Raid had made operations against the Atlantic convoy lanes too risky. Tirpitz acted as a fleet in being, forcing the British Royal Navy to retain significant naval forces in the area to contain the battleship.|$|E

5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II in September 1939, Leipzig {{was assigned to the}} blocking force that was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the escape of the Polish Navy from the Baltic; they were unsuccessful. Leipzig thereafter went to the North Sea, where she and the other light cruisers laid a series of defensive minefields. This task lasted {{through the end of the}} month, after which she returned to the Baltic for training maneuvers. On 1719 November, Leipzig covered a minelaying operation in the North Sea. She joined Deutschland, Köln, and three torpedo boats for a sweep in the Skagerrak for Allied shipping on 2122 November. Leipzig was tasked with escorting the battleships Scharnhorst and Gneisenau through the Skagerrak, and with covering their return on the 27th.|$|E
5|$|At the {{outbreak}} of World War II on 1 September 1939, Nürnberg {{was assigned to the}} blockade force that was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the Polish Navy from escaping the Baltic. Despite the Germans' efforts, several Polish destroyers and submarines escaped to Britain, where they continued the war. On 3 September, Nürnberg {{and the rest of the}} cruisers were withdrawn to the North Sea to lay a series of defensive minefields to protect the German coastline. She returned to the Baltic for training exercises in October. The following month, she was transferred back to the North Sea, where she was tasked with escorting destroyers laying minefields off the British coast. On 46 December, the ship conducted a mining operation off Kristiansand, Norway.|$|E
5|$|Most of the Strauss {{works that}} are {{performed}} today may once have existed {{in a slightly}} different form, as Eduard Strauss destroyed much of the original Strauss orchestral archives in a furnace factory in Vienna's Mariahilf district in 1907. Eduard, then the only surviving brother of the three, took this drastic precaution after agreeing to a pact between himself and brother Josef that whoever outlived the other was to destroy their works. The measure was <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> the Strauss family's works from being claimed by another composer. This may also have been fueled by Strauss's rivalry with another of Vienna's popular waltz and march composers, Karl Michael Ziehrer.|$|E

5|$|The regiment's first full–fledged war {{experience}} {{happened in}} early January 1862 in northeastern Kentucky, where they assisted {{the command of}} Colonel James A. Garfield. For the next two years, most of the regiment's fighting was in the mountainous backwoods of what later became the southern portion of West Virginia, especially the Kanawha River Valley. During the Kanawha Campaign in September 1862, the 2nd Regiment of Loyal Virginia Volunteer Cavalry cleared away Confederate cavalry that <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a retreating Union Army from reaching the safety of Ohio. By 1864, the regiment {{was part of the}} Army of West Virginia, and spent much of its time fighting in the western portion of today's state of Virginia. It participated in General David Hunter's unsuccessful raid on Lynchburg. It also participated in Union General Philip Sheridan's Shenandoah Valley Campaign, playing an important part in the Third Battle of Winchester.|$|E
5|$|Three {{defensive}} {{positions are}} positioned outside the main ramparts of the castle. To the south, reached by an underground passage, is the Half-Moon Battery, constructed in 1793 and redesigned in 1895 and 1941. This has two camouflaged gun houses and 6-inch guns {{dating from the}} Second World War, when it held a team of 99 soldiers. Further south, near the waterline, is the Little Dennis Blockhouse, a D-shaped gun position dating from 1539, altered in the 1540s and then adapted to form {{part of a larger}} fortification covering the whole of Pendennis Point in the late 16th century. Built from Killas rubble, the exterior of the blockhouse and its lookout turret still survive intact. Just along the shoreline to the north-east is the Crab Quay Battery, a set of defences originating in the 16th century, <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> an amphibious landing on the headland, and modernised extensively in 1902.|$|E
5|$|Before he died, Bolesław III Wrymouth {{divided the}} country, {{in a limited}} sense, among four of his sons. He made complex {{arrangements}} <b>intended</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> fratricidal warfare and preserve the Polish state's formal unity, but after Bolesław's death, {{the implementation of the}} plan failed and a long period of fragmentation was ushered in. For nearly two centuries, the Piasts would spar with each other, the clergy, and the nobility for the control over the divided kingdom. The stability of the system was supposedly assured by the institution of the senior or high duke of Poland, based in Kraków and assigned to the special Seniorate Province that was not to be subdivided. Following his concept of seniorate, Bolesław divided the country into five principalities: Silesia, Greater Poland, Masovia, Sandomierz and Kraków. The first four provinces were given to his four sons, who became independent rulers. The fifth province, the Seniorate Province of Kraków, was {{to be added to the}} senior among the princes who, as the Grand Duke of Kraków, was the representative of the whole of Poland. This principle broke down already within the generation of Bolesław III's sons, when Władysław II the Exile, Bolesław IV the Curly, Mieszko III the Old and Casimir II the Just fought for power and territory in Poland, and in particular over the throne of Kraków.|$|E

Marshall {{initially}} denied murdering Howe, claiming that Bush murdered him and that he only helped to dismember and dispose of the body, admitting counts of perverting the course of justice and <b>intending</b> <b>to</b> <b>prevent</b> a coroner from holding an inquest. Bush denied all charges.|$|R
