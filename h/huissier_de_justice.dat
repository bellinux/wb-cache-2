50|$|In {{some places}} like France, the Netherlands, Germany, Japan, China, and Quebec which follow the {{continental}} legal system, {{service of process}} is performed by a court bailiff (French <b>huissier</b> <b>de</b> <b>justice,</b> Dutch gerechtsdeurwaarder, German Gerichtsvollzieher), either in person (personal process) or by mail (non-personal process). Some of these jurisdictions distinguish two main forms of action - signification (serving process) and notification (notice). Bailiffs are only responsible for service of process.|$|E

40|$|This {{historical}} essay {{develops a}} new {{interpretation of the}} Lit <b>de</b> <b>Justice</b> of the kings of France by concentrating on the historical and legendary life of the assembly and the ceremonial ritual and modes of discourse illicited therein : the Lit <b>de</b> <b>Justice</b> assembly made its constitutional début in the early XVIth century, not in the XIVth century, as previously supposed, and provided a forum for propagating precepts of French public law : following the novel convocation of Francois Ier three Lits <b>de</b> <b>Justice</b> of 1527 and 1537, {{and again in the}} wake of Louis XIII extraordinary inaugural Lit <b>de</b> <b>Justice</b> of 1610, the archival research of antiquarians produced first a fiction, then a legend, about the Lit <b>de</b> <b>Justice</b> within the assembly in the ancient French constitution. In turn, that influencial legend stimulated the convocation of more Lits <b>de</b> <b>Justice</b> in the XVIth century and numerous assemblies in the XVIIth century, evincing a transformation of constitutional ideology.

5000|$|A <b>huissier</b> <b>de</b> <b>justice</b> (literally French for [...] "justice usher"), {{sometimes}} anglicized as judicial officer, is {{an officer}} of the court in France, Luxembourg, Belgium, Canada, Greece, Italy, and Switzerland. The officer is appointed by a magistrate of the court (or in France, by the Minister of Justice) and holds a monopoly on the service and execution of court decisions and enforceable instruments. Huissiers de justice also serve as formal witnesses to events (constat d'huissier) {{in the manner of a}} notary public.|$|E
50|$|The {{composition}} of the Great Council was noticeably stable throughout the centuries. It had one chairman or president, 15 to 16 councillors, one procureur-general, one replacement procureur-general, one fiscal advocate, 10 paid secretaries, two or three clerks, advocates and lastly <b>Huissier</b> <b>de</b> <b>justice.</b> Of the councillors, who wore red vestments, traditionally four were clerical, later lessened to two. All councillors were appointed by the ruler {{from a list of}} candidates of the Council itself. They had to be licentiate or doctor in law at one of the universities in the ruler's lands.|$|E
50|$|Most of the {{functions}} associated with the older Dutch-language terms translated as bailiff in English, are no longer found in one officer. The modern terms <b>huissier</b> <b>de</b> <b>justice</b> (in French) or gerechtsdeurwaarder (in Dutch) however, are often, and inaccurately, translated into English as bailiff, though the latter under an Anglo Saxon law system {{is by no means}} identical to the former who is typical for many countries influenced by the Napoleonic Code. He or she is a sworn officer who may legally deliver exploits (process serving), see to the execution of court orders such as the confiscation of goods, or make formal record of events, acts and circumstances. In Belgium, the bailiff can be appointed by a confiscating court to exercise the judicial mandate of schuldbemiddelaar (in Dutch) or médiateur de dettes (in French), a debt negotiator, in a procedure called collectieve schuldenregeling (CSR) or médiation collective de dettes, a collectively negotiated settlement of debts, which is comparable with the regulations by the Wet Schuldsanering Natuurlijke Personen (WSNP) in the Netherlands.|$|E
