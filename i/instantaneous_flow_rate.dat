40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{patterns of}} factor utilization and output adjustment {{at the plant}} level {{for a wide range}} of manufacturing industries. We explain why manufacturing plants may differ quite a bit in how they accomplish output adjustments, depending on shutdown cost aspects of technology. Assembly-type operations with low shutdown costs would primarily vary the work period of the plant, whereas continuous processing plants with large shutdown costs would adjust <b>instantaneous</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> of production. For larger output increases, a lengthening of the work period by assemblers would entail employment changes, whereas continuous processors would be more apt to relax physical capital constraints. We use micro survey data on the organization of actual and capacity plant operations to describe the observed patterns of adjustment in individual manufacturing industries and find substantial heterogeneity across industries. For manufacturing as a whole, the work-week appears to be a significant margin of adjustment. Industrial capacity; Productivity; Manufactures...|$|R

40|$|Fluid dynamic {{analysis}} of turbodynamic blood pumps (TBPs) is often conducted under steady flow conditions. However, {{the preponderance of}} clinical applications for ventricular assistance involves unsteady, pulsatile flow-due to the residual contractility of the native heart. This study was undertaken to demonstrate the importance of pulsatility and the associated time derivative of the <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> (dQ/dt) on hemodynamics within a clinical-scale TBP. This was accomplished by performing flow visualization studies on a transparent model of a centrifugal TBP interposed within a cardiovascular simulator with controllable heart rate and stroke volume. Particle image velocimetry triggered to both the rotation angle of the impeller and phase of the cardiac cycle was used to quantify the velocity field in the outlet volute and in between the impeller blades for 16 phases of the cardiac cycle. Comparison of the unsteady flow fields to corresponding steady conditions at the same (<b>instantaneous)</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> revealed marked differences. In particular, deceleration of flow was found to promote separation within the outlet diffuser, while acceleration served to stabilize the velocity field. The notable differences between the acceleration and deceleration phases illustrated the prominence of inertial fluid forces. These studies {{emphasize the importance of}} dQ/dt as an independent variable for thorough preclinical validation of TBPs intended for use as a ventricular assist device...|$|R

40|$|Planning {{engineers}} commonly use generous {{factors of}} safety for peak flow estimates in urban water supply systems {{both as a}} hedge against unforeseen growth and because economies of scale result in relatively low user costs even with such reserve capacity. Transplanting of such design criteria into the rural setting, however, simply does not work. The low density portions of rural domestic systems require very realistic design criteria or the construction costs become infeasible for {{the small number of}} customers involved. Peak <b>instantaneous</b> <b>flow</b> <b>rates</b> in a Utah rural system were measured continuously during two summers on three dead-end lines serving various numbers of customers.

40|$|Pulsatile flow {{of blood}} through a rigid tube has been studied under the {{influence}} of body acceleration. With the help of finite Hankel and Laplace transforms, analytic expressions for axial velocity, fluid acceleration, wall shear and <b>instantaneous</b> volume <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> have been obtained. It is of interest to note that these solutions can be used for all the feasible values of pulsatile and body acceleration Reynolds numbers Re(p) and Re(b). This is in contrast with the existing results where different approximate solutions have to be used for different ranges of Re(p) and Re(b). Using physiological data, the following qualitative and quantitative results have been obtained. The amplitude of the <b>instantaneous</b> volume <b>flow</b> <b>rate,</b> for <b>flows</b> with body acceleration, decreases sharply as the tube radius decreases (from aorta to arteriole). This variation of amplitude is very slow for flows with no body acceleration. Another interesting result is the maximum of the axial velocity and fluid acceleration shifts from the tube axis to the vicinity of the tube wall as the tube diameter increases. The variation of the amplitude of wall shear with tube diameter (aorta to coronary) is less for flows with body acceleration than that of flows with no body acceleration. The phase lag between pressure gradient and <b>flow</b> <b>rate</b> changes sharply with tube diameter in narrow tubes, it varies asymptotically in wide tubes. The obtained results are qualitatively in good agreement with existing theoretical observations. Quantitatively, they differ from the other theoretical results (19 to 3000 %).
