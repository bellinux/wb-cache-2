Sixteen RC plane moment frames with different span-to-depth ratios and three 3 D RC frames were analyzed to evaluate their seismic behavior at different <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> established by the ASCE 41 - 06. For each span-to-depth ratio, four different beam longitudinal reinforcement steel ratios were used that varied from 0.85 to 2.5 % for the 2 D frames. Nonlinear time history analyses of the frames were performed using scaled ground motions. The impact of different span-to-depth and reinforcement ratios on the <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> was evaluated.

40|$|Aculops lobuliferus (Keifer) is {{a little}} known pest of {{plantation}} Populus spp., which is capable of causing substantial damage. This is the first documented occurrence of A. lobuliferus in South Carolina. Previous anecdotal data indicated clonal variation in Populus susceptibility to A. lobuliferus damage. A damage rating scale was created to monitor mite damage in 2000 - 2001 in a short-rotation woody crop plantation; damage descriptions and seasonal phenology also were recorded. Foliar damage and terminal mortality were monitored on two Populus deltoides Bartr. clones, ST 66 and S 7 C 15, receiving one of three silvicultural treatments (irrigated, fertilized or both) or no treatment (control). In 2001, early season foliar damage ratings were significantly higher on clone S 7 C 15; however, damage on clone ST 66 was greater after miticide treatments later in the year. Terminal mortality did not differ between clones. Silvicultural treatments significantly affected foliar <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> in both clones. Application of a commercially available miticide significantly reduced A. lobuliferus <b>damage</b> <b>levels.</b> This study demonstrates that A. lobuliferus <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> can be influenced by Populus clone and silvicultural treatment. Foliar and terminal <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> observed in this study indicate the potential for substantial economic impact of A. lobuliferus on plantation Populus.

40|$|Context: This {{study was}} carried out on the {{assumption}} that oral mucosal cells might show DNA damage in oral squamous cell carcinoma (OSCC). Aims: To evaluate the extent of DNA damage in oral smears of patients with OSCC and determine correlation if any of the extent of DNA damage to TNM staging of oral cancer. Settings and design: A randomized controlled study at a regional cancer centre was designed for this project. Smears were taken from lesion proper of 30 patients with OSCC and from the buccal mucosa of 30 normal healthy volunteers. Materials and methods: Collected cells were centrifuged and single-cell gel electrophoresis (SCGE) assay was performed. DNA damage was visualized under a fluorescent microscope. Statistical analysis used : Mean DNA <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> of both the groups were measured and statistically analyzed with students′ test. The extent of DNA damage was correlated with the TNM stages by employing the one way ANOVA ′F′ technique.

A valuable tool for monitoring these effects is the use of sentinel organisms. Particularly, small mammals living inside mine tailings are an excellent study system because their analysis represents a realistic approach of mixtures and concentrations of metal exposure. Purpose We analyzed metal tissue concentrations and DNA <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> for comparison between genders of a sentinel (Peromyscus melanophrys) and a nonsentinel (Baiomys musculus) species. Also, the relationship between DNA damage and the distance from the contamination source was evaluated. Methods This study was conducted in an abandoned mine tailing at Morelos, Mexico. Thirty-six individuals from both species at the exposed and reference sites were sampled. Metal concentrations in bone and liver of both species were analyzed by atomic absorption spectrophotometry, and DNA <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> were assayed using the alkaline comet assay. Results In general, concentrations of zinc, nickel, iron, and manganese were statistically higher in exposed individuals. A significant effect of the organ and the site on all metal tissue concentrations was detected. Significant DNA <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> were registered in the exposed group, being higher in B. musculus. Females registered higher DNA <b>damage</b> <b>levels</b> than males. A negative relationship between distance from the mine tailing and DNA damage in B. musculus was observed. Conclusions We consider that B. musculus is a suitable species to assess environmental quality, especially for bio-accumulable pollutants—such as metals—and recommend that it may be considered as a sentinel species...|$|R

5000|$|There {{are many}} methods {{available}} for determining mechanical grain damage. The simplest method involves visible {{inspection of the}} grain. The USDA lists the threshold for broken grain to be anything that will fit through a 12/64 and 8/64 inch round-hole sieve for maize and soybeans respectively as listed above. This does not account to any cracks or defects in the leftover grain itself. In 1976, Chowdhury and Buchele developed a Numerical Damage Index for maize. They proposed a system that characterized the damage to each kernel {{on a scale from}} D1 (no defects) to D5 (very severely damaged). The procedure then takes a weighted average of the amount of kernels assigned to each level to obtain a standardized measure of mechanical damage. This approach is based on visual observations, which carry with them a large amount of variability due to the individual conducting the test. Therefore, other researchers have attempted to measure mechanical damage in more concrete ways. For example, one method is to use a dye that will adhere only to the broken areas of the kernel. From there, the dye is washed off with some type of solvent and measured using a calorimetric technique. [...] A more recently developed technique uses the dielectric properties of the grain to measure the <b>damage</b> <b>level.</b> [...] This method proved to very accurately measure the number of damaged kernels.|$|E
5000|$|Marvel: Future Fight {{has been}} {{described}} as a dungeon crawler. Players have the option to use either virtual joystick and button controls or tap-based controls. The player plays with a maximum team of 3 characters in a team on a level. The player controls one of the characters and may interchange with the other team members. A character swap will incur a cool down before the player can swap back to the previously used character.Each mission uses energy to play. Energy is gained by leveling up your SHIELD base with SHIELD XP, through in game rewards and achievements. There are over 135 different playable characters. The player's character has a default attack mode which does substantial damage involving repetitive melee/weapon attacks based on the character type chosen. The active character will lock onto a target and continue moving toward it to attack it unless input to behave otherwise. Apart from the default attack mode each character has additional special skills these may be directed attacks,AOE attacks or induce application of buffs or shields and are unique to each character. Each skill comes with a cool down. Skills are either active or passive. An active skill is initiated by the user, while passive skills will trigger on specific conditions met during game play. A character will start out with 2 skills initially and gain upto 6 skills as it is ranked up.Apart from the 6 skills each character has an additional Leadership skill unlocked through mastery of the character. This skill is active when the character is in the leadership position of the team. All team members will receive the benefits of the leadership skill for the entire duration of the level.Another skill type called tier-2 skill is unlocked when the character attains tier-2 status. Certain characters start out as automatic tier-2 charactersThe player can have a maximum of 5 teams set up. There are also team bonuses, for certain sets of character team combinations. Characters are unlocked and ranked up by obtaining Biometrics, which can be found in certain missions as well as the Game store. Characters can get better upgrade options at higher levels and can be leveled up through character XP. Players are able to customize heroes to their play style through upgrades, such as upgrading skills, gear, and equipping ISO-8. Upgrading skills increases their <b>damage</b> <b>level,</b> upgrading gear improves a specific trait of the hero, like HP or Attack Speed, and equipping ISO-8 sets provides varying buffs and traits. In the various stores, in addition to Biometrics, players can also buy chests, energy, clear tickets, ISO-8, Biometric packages, and other supplies. Certain stores require tokens while the Game store require either gems or real currency the uniform store and SHIELD lab mini-store require gems and gold.|$|E
