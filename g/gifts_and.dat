As part of this deal, Neaira agreed to no longer work as a prostitute in Corinth, and so left the city for Athens with Phrynion, who had helped her buy her freedom.|$|E

40|$|This paper {{reports on}} the first {{systematic}} review of <b>Gifted</b> <b>and</b> Talented Education. Its main aim was to investigate interventions designed to improve the educational achievement of students identified as <b>Gifted</b> <b>and</b> Talented. A systematic literature review method was used for both content analysis and in-depth thematic synthesis of the articles. The review offers tentative corroboration for recent English educational policies that focus support for <b>Gifted</b> <b>and</b> Talented students within mainstream settings. Materials that emphasise personalised, differentiated learning are, therefore, generally well-placed to offer specific guidance...|$|R
5|$|But {{the player}} {{primarily}} responsible for elevating the Modern Benoni {{to the status of}} a major opening was Mikhail Tal, who took up the opening in 1953 after seeing one of Nezhmetdinov's games.

Famous examples include his game against Bukhuti Gurgenidze at the 1957 USSR championship, excerpted below, and his win against Yuri Averbakh at the same tournament the following year.|$|E

5|$|From January until March 1686, La Salle {{and most}} of his men searched {{overland}} for the Mississippi River, traveling towards the Rio Grande, possibly as far west as modern-day Langtry, Texas.

When the group returned, they were unable to find the Belle where they had left her and were forced to walk back to the fort.|$|E

40|$|To {{show how}} diverse {{breeding}} systems, including polyandry, evolve in insects, I present {{a model of}} co-evolution between nuptial <b>gift</b> size <b>and</b> female multiple mating. I assume that males and females determine their strategy (amount of nuptial <b>gift</b> <b>and</b> frequency of mating, respectively) according to the strategy adopted by the other sex. The model demonstrates that co-evolution leads to diverse breeding systems: systems with both nuptial <b>gift</b> <b>and</b> female multiple mating, systems with nuptial <b>gift</b> only <b>and</b> systems with neither nuptial gift nor female multiple mating. The equilibrium breeding system is determined based on the sex ratio, efficiency of nuptial gift on the improvement of offspring survivorship, cost of nuptial <b>gift</b> production <b>and</b> cost of additional mating...|$|R
