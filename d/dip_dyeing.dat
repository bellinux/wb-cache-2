50|$|Pearly everlastings are {{suitable}} for flower beds and floral arrangements. They provide attractive, but not brilliant displays of bloom in late summer and fall. They are sometimes placed adjacent to red or blue flowers for aesthetic purposes. The flowers are useful for cutting and are easily prepared for dried arrangements. This is done by cutting them before they attain their fullest opening and before the whiteness of the stems and foliage begins to dim, tying the stems in small bundles, and hanging them in a cool, airy, shaded place. It {{is not uncommon to}} color the dried flowers by <b>dipping</b> them in <b>dyes.</b>|$|R

5000|$|In the pre-electric era, épéeists used a point d'arrêt ("stopping point"), a three-pronged {{point with}} small {{protruding}} spikes, which would snag on the opponent's clothing or mask, helping the referee {{to see the}} hits. The spikes caused épée fencing to be a notoriously painful affair, and épéeists could be easily recognized by the tears in their jacket sleeves. A later evolution of the sport used a point that was <b>dipped</b> in a <b>dye,</b> which showed the location of touches on a white uniform; the dye was soluble in weak acid (e.g., acetic acid) to remove old marks. [...] Today competition is done with electric weapons, where a circuit is closed when the touch is made. Non-electric weapons are now typically used only for practice, generally fitted with plastic buttons.|$|R

[...] He asked for one <b>dye</b> <b>dip</b> fewer than the RAN blue (three indigo dips rather than four). There was a change to a lighter blue when an all-seasons uniform was introduced in the 1970s. The original colour and style were re-adopted around 2005. Slip-on rank epaulettes, known as [...] "Soft Rank Insignia" [...] (SRI), displaying the word [...] "AUSTRALIA" [...] are worn on the shoulders of the service dress uniform.

50|$|Firstly, {{the cloth}} must be washed, soaked and beaten {{with a large}} mallet. The hot and liquid wax is scooped from small wajan (wok) heated upon small stove. The batik craftperson {{sometimes}} blow the spout tip of canting to allow the liquid wax to flow smoothly and to avoid clogging, then they draw the line or dot upon the cloth, applying the liquid wax, following the patterns and images that previously had been drawn using pencil. A pattern is then drawn with hot wax called malam using canting. The wax functions as a dye-resist. After this, the cloth is <b>dipped</b> in a <b>dye</b> bath containing the first colour. After the cloth is dry, the wax is removed by scraping or boiling the cloth. This process is repeated {{as many times as}} the number of colours desired. For larger areas of cloth which need to be covered, the wax is applied using a tool called tonyok nemboki/mopoki.|$|R
50|$|Cloth weaving is {{basically}} {{similar to the}} style of the neighboring Muslim region. The weaving loom is set up inside the house. Cotton thread—spun from cotton by womenusing the distaff crafted by men—and abaca fiber are commonly used. Before cotton was introduced by Muslim and Christian traders, the Subanen used abaca fiber for their clothing and blankets. The strands or fibers are first dyed before being put in the loom. In this process, several strands are bound together at intervals by other fibers, forming bands of various widths. Thus tightly bound, these are <b>dipped</b> into the <b>dye,</b> then laid out to dry. The effect is that the bound part retains the natural color of the fiber, while the rest has the color of the dye. The process can be repeated to achieve various designs or color combinations. The favorite dye among the Subanen is red, with black also being widely used. Native dyes from natural substances, which give a flat or matte color, and aniline dyes are used in the process.|$|R

Though he begins with [...] "commonplaces", he [...] "takes care to adorn his subject matter [...] "with 'thoughts that breathe and words that burn' ... we always find {{the spirit of the}} man of genius breathing from his verse".

[...] Do you not think it will make some odds to these children that they were brought up under the Maples? Hundreds of eyes are steadily drinking in this color, and by these teachers even the truants are caught and educated the moment they step abroad. Indeed, neither the truant nor the studious is at present taught color in the schools. These are instead of the bright colors in apothecaries' shops and city windows. It is a pity that we have no more Red Maples, and some Hickories, in our streets as well. Our paint-box is very imperfectly filled. Instead of, or beside, supplying such paint-boxes as we do, we might supply these natural colors to the young. Where else will they study color under greater advantages? What School of Design can vie with this? Think how much the eyes of painters of all kinds, and of manufacturers of cloth and paper, and paper-stainers, and countless others, are to be educated by these autumnal colors. The stationer's envelopes may be of very various tints, yet, not so various as those of the leaves of a single tree. If you want a different shade or tint of a particular color, you have only to look farther within or without the tree or the wood.

6000|$|... 91. And {{in doing}} this we have first to note {{the meaning of the}} {{principal}} epithet applied to Athena, [...] "Glaukopis," [...] "with eyes full of light," [...] the first syllable being connected, by its root, with words signifying sight, not with words signifying color. As far as I can trace the color perception of the Greeks, I find it all founded primarily on the degree of connection between color and light; the most important fact to them in the color of red being its connection with fire and sunshine; so that [...] "purple" [...] is, in its original sense, [...] "fire-color," [...] and the scarlet or orange, of dawn, more than any other fire-color. I was long puzzled by Homer's calling the sea purple; and misled into thinking he meant the color of cloud shadows on green sea; whereas he really means the gleaming blaze of the waves under wide light. Aristotle's idea (partly true) is that light, subdued by blackness, becomes red; and blackness, heated or lighted, also becomes red. Thus, a color may be called purple because it is light subdued (and so death is called [...] "purple" [...] or [...] "shadowy" [...] death); or else it may be called purple as being shade kindled with fire, and thus said of the lighted sea; or even of the sun itself, when it is thought of as a red luminary opposed to the whiteness of the moon: [...] "purpureos inter soles, et candida lunæ sidera;" [...] or of golden hair: [...] "pro purpureo pnam solvens scelerata capillo;" [...] while both ideas are modified by the influence of an earlier form of the word, which {{has nothing to do with}} fire at all, but only with mixing or staining; and then, to make the whole group of thoughts inextricably complex, yet rich and subtle in proportion to their intricacy, the various rose and crimson colors of the murex dye,--the crimson and purple of the poppy, and fruit of the palm,-- and the association of all these with the hue of blood,--partly direct, partly through a confusion between the word signifying [...] "slaughter" [...] and [...] "palm-fruit color," [...] mingle themselves in, and renew the whole nature of the old word; so that, in later literature, it means a different color, or emotion of color, in almost every place where it occurs; and cast forever around the reflection of all that has been <b>dipped</b> in its <b>dyes.</b>|$|R
