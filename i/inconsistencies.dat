As a first step, a system of paraconsistent logic is introduced which distinguishes between weak and strong <b>inconsistency.</b> While weak <b>inconsistency</b> is harmless, strong <b>inconsistency</b> is destructive. Second, a case study demonstrates that in generative syntax weak <b>inconsistency</b> may be a useful tool of problem solving.

40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the problem of}} <b>inconsistency</b> measurement on large knowledge bases by considering stream-based <b>inconsistency</b> measurement, i. e., we investigate <b>inconsistency</b> measures that cannot consider a knowledge base as a whole but process it within a stream.

We conduct an extensive empirical analysis on the behavior of these <b>inconsistency</b> measures on large knowledge bases, in terms of runtime, accuracy, and scalability.

40|$|Pairwise {{comparison}} matrices often exhibit <b>inconsistency,</b> therefore, {{a number}} of indices has been introduced to measure their deviation from a consistent matrix.

We illustrate by an example that this set seems to be not exhaustive, hence expand it by adding two new properties. We consider all axioms on the set of triads, and choose the logically independent ones.

40|$|Measuring <b>inconsistency</b> in {{knowledge}} bases {{has been recognized}} as an important problem in several research areas. Many methods have been proposed {{to solve this problem}} and a main class of them is based on some kind of paraconsistent semantics. However, existing methods suffer from two limitations: (i) they are mostly restricted to propositional knowledge bases; (ii) very few of them discuss computational aspects of computing <b>inconsistency</b> measures. In this article, we try to solve these two limitations by exploring algorithms for computing an <b>inconsistency</b> measure of first-order knowledge bases. After introducing a four-valued semantics for first-order logic, we define an <b>inconsistency</b> measure of a first-order knowledge base, which is a sequence of <b>inconsistency</b> degrees. We then propose a precise algorithm to compute our <b>inconsistency</b> measure. We show that this algorithm reduces the computation of the <b>inconsistency</b> measure to classical satisfiability checking. This is done by introducing a new semantics, named S[n]- 4 semantics, which can be calculated by invoking a classical SAT solver. Moreover, we show that this auxiliary semantics also gives a direct way to compute upper and lower bounds of <b>inconsistency</b> degrees. That is, it can be easily revised to compute approximating <b>inconsistency</b> measures. The approximating <b>inconsistency</b> measures converge to the precise values if enough resources are available. Finally, by some nice properties of the S[n]- 4 semantics, we show that some upper and lower bounds can be computed in P-time, which says that the problem of computing these approximating <b>inconsistency</b> measures is tractable...|$|R
40|$|International audienceMeasuring <b>inconsistency</b> {{degrees of}} {{knowledge}} bases (KBs) provides important context information for facilitating <b>inconsistency</b> handling. Several semantic and syntax based {{measures have been}} proposed separately. In this paper, we propose {{a new way to}} define <b>inconsistency</b> measurements by combining semantic and syntax based approaches. It is based on counting the variables of minimal unsatisfiable subsets (MUSes) and minimal correction subsets (MCSes), which leads to two equivalent <b>inconsistency</b> degrees, named IDMUS and IDMCS. We give the theoretical and experimental comparisons between them and two purely semantic-based <b>inconsistency</b> degrees: 4 -valued and the Quasi Classical semantics based <b>inconsistency</b> degrees. More- over, the computational complexities related to our new <b>inconsistency</b> measurements are studied. As it turns out that computing the exact <b>inconsistency</b> degrees is intractable in general, we then propose and evaluate an anytime algorithm to make IDMUS and IDMCS usable in knowledge management applications. In particular, as most of syntax based measures tend to be difficult to compute in reality due to the exponential number of MUSes, our new <b>inconsistency</b> measures are practical because the numbers of variables in MUSes are often limited or easily to be approximated. We evaluate our approach on the DC benchmark. Our encourag- ing experimental results show that these new <b>inconsistency</b> measure- ments or their approximations are efficient to handle large knowledge bases and to better distinguish inconsistent knowledge bases...|$|R
