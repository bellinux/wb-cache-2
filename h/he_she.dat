25|$|Most {{of these}} endings {{are the same}} as in Esperanto except for -i, -ir, -ar, -or and -ez. Esperanto marks noun plurals by an agglutinative ending -j (so plural nouns end in -oj), uses -i for verb infinitives (Esperanto infinitives are tenseless), and uses -u for the imperative. Verbs in both Esperanto and Ido do not {{conjugate}} depending on person, number or gender; the -as, -is, and -os endings suffice whether the subject is I, you, <b>he,</b> <b>she,</b> they, or anything else.|$|E

2500|$|The infinitive suffix -i may {{derive from}} Latin {{deponent}} verbs, such as loqui (to speak). With elements like these {{that are only}} one or two letters long, {{it is difficult to know}} whether resemblances are due to the forms being related, or just coincidence. For example, it is speculated that the jussive -u is from the Hebrew imperative -û, but it could also be from the Greek [...] imperative of deponent verbs such as dekhou (receive!); or perhaps it was inspired by [...] being found in both Hebrew and Greek. Similarly, adverbial -e is found in Latin and Italian (bene) as well as in Russian (after a palatalized consonant); the participle bases -t- and -nt- are found in Latin, Italian, Greek, and German; and the pronominal base -i is found in Italian (-mi, -ti, -vi, -si, -gli for Esperanto mi, ci, vi, si, li) and English (me, we, <b>he,</b> <b>she).</b>|$|E

On the other hand, if <b>he</b> or <b>she</b> behaves well and gains the trust of he or her colleagues, <b>he</b> or <b>she</b> is rewarded with progressively higher access rights. This increase in rights may also be {{based on the fact that}} <b>he</b> or <b>she</b> will become more experienced over time and less likely to abuse the system inadvertently.
