Music Review |publisher=Slant Magazine |date=December 19, 2010 |accessdate=January 8, 2011}} Matthew Horton of BBC Music called it a [...] "lovely single", while Ken Capobianco of The Boston Globe called it [...] "swaggering". Glenn Gamboa of Newsday wrote that, [...] "Though Ne-Yo gives 'Pretty Girl Rock' an addictive sheen, it's the remix featuring some memorable verses from Kanye West that gets the point across best." [...] Kyle Anderson of MTV Newsroom praised Hilson's [...] "confidence and sweetness" [...] on the song, and described the beat as [...] "funky and sick."

500|$|According to Jon Pareles of The New York Times, [...] "after all {{the nuances}} Madonna {{has brought to}} the role of the bad girl, it's strange that she would settle now for such a restricted, unexamined version of respectability" [...] and [...] "for the first time, Madonna has let the deal dictate the music". Tan Gim Ean from New Straits Times noted that Madonna played against her {{strengths}} on the songs of the album. He described her vocals as [...] "competent", but felt that the songs required [...] "more range and agility than Madonna has at her disposal." [...] Dave Tianen from Milwaukee Journal Sentinel described the album as a [...] "mixed bag of period pieces, some of them too cute for their own good", adding that [...] "I'm Breathless never becomes more than the sum of its mannerisms". AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine claimed that the songs are just [...] "cutesy novelty numbers", and listing [...] "Vogue" [...] as a standout track. Rooksby panned the album, saying that it [...] "failed to transcend the sterile, preserved-in-amber quality of pastiche". Mark Cooper from Q magazine lamented, in its June 1990 review, [...] "It's something of a disappointment because the lady herself stays so firmly committed to a character who's less original than the persona she evolved during the '80s." [...] Nonetheless, in the same magazine's December 1994 issue, Madonna declared: [...] "I would <b>have</b> <b>to</b> <b>say</b> <b>the</b> favorite record that I've made is the soundtrack to Dick Tracy. I love every one of those songs... My judgment is never based on the world's reaction." ...|$|E

2500|$|In 1917, Taft and {{his wife}} bought a [...] farm in Indian Hill, a well-to-do suburb of Cincinnati. Called Sky Farm, it would serve as Taft's primary {{residence}} {{for the rest of}} his life. The Tafts gradually made extensive renovations that turned the small farmhouse into a sixteen-room mansion. On the farm Taft enjoyed growing strawberries, asparagus, and potatoes for profit. During the summer, Taft often vacationed with his wife and children at the Taft family's summer home at Murray Bay, in Quebec, Canada. Although he was nominally a member of the Episcopal church, his biographer James Patterson noted that Taft's [...] "religious inclinations were weak" [...] and that he was a [...] "Sunday morning golfer, not a church-going Episcopalian."

The Jacobin minority have been abundantly supplied with stores and provisions of all kinds towards their warfare. No sort of argumentative materials, suited to their purposes, have been withheld. False they are, unsound, sophistical; but they are regular in their direction. They all bear one way, and they all go to the support of the substantial merits of their cause.
