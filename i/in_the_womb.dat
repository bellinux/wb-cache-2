5|$|It is also {{possible}} to obtain a prenatal diagnosis for an embryo or fetus <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>womb,</b> using fetal genetic material acquired through chorionic villus sampling. An amniocentesis can be performed if the pregnancy is further along, within 14–18 weeks. This procedure looks at the amniotic fluid surrounding the baby for indicators of the HD mutation. This, too, can be paired with exclusion testing to avoid disclosure of parental genotype. Prenatal testing can be done when a parent has been diagnosed with HD, when they have had genetic testing showing {{the expansion of the}} HTT gene, or when they have a 50% chance of inheriting the disease. The parents can be counseled on their options, which include termination of pregnancy, and on the difficulties of a child with the identified gene.|$|E

5|$|Legend {{goes that}} Tulsidas was born after staying <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> for twelve months, {{he had all}} thirty two teeth in his mouth at birth, his health and looks were {{like that of a}} five-year-old boy, and he did not cry {{at the time of his}} birth but uttered Rama instead.

As per the Mula Gosain Charita, he was born under the Abhuktamūla constellation, which according to Jyotisha (Hindu astrology) causes immediate danger to the life of the father. Due to the inauspicious events at the time of his birth, he was abandoned by his parents on the fourth night, sent away with Chuniya (some sources call her Muniya), a female servant of Hulsi. In his works Kavitavali and Vinayapatrika, Tulsidas attests to his parents abandoning him after birth due to an inauspicious astrological configuration.|$|E
5|$|Perieres' {{family was}} {{centered}} around Messene. His son Leucippus had several daughters, but Arsinoe was {{singled out for}} extensive treatment. To Apollo she bore Asclepius, whom Zeus killed. In a rage Apollo killed the Cyclopes, after which Zeus was about to hurl him into Tartarus when Leto interceded and arranged for Apollo {{to serve as a}} laborer for Admetus instead. Directly following the Asclepius affair comes the Ehoie of Asterodeia, the daughter of Deion. She bore Crisus and Panopeus to Phocus; the brothers did not get along, quarreling while still <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>womb.</b> Another daughter of Deion, Philonis, bore Philammon to Apollo and Autolycus to Hermes. Philammon sired Thamyris; Autolycus, the grandfather of Odysseus, was a master thief who could change the appearance of his booty to avoid detection. Autolycus' daughter Polymele, the mother of Jason, is apparently born directly preceding the Ehoie of Mestra, the daughter of Erysichthon.|$|E
5|$|According to the legend, Vasu (also {{known as}} Uparicara Vasu), a Chedi King, {{was on a}} hunting {{expedition}} {{when he had a}} nocturnal emission while dreaming of his wife. Using an eagle, He sent his semen to his queen but due to a fight mid-air with another eagle, the semen fell into the river and was swallowed by the cursed Adrika-fish. Consequently, the fish became pregnant. Soon, A fisherman caught the pregnant fish and cut it open to find two babies <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> of the fish, one male and one female. The fisherman presented the children to the king, who kept the male child. The boy grew up to become King Matsya, the founder of the Matsya Kingdom. The king gave the female child back to the fisherman, naming her Matsya-gandha ("She who smells like fish"). The fisherman raised the girl as his daughter and named her Kali ("the dark one") because of her complexion. Over the course of time, Kali earned the name Satyavati ("truthful"). The fisherman was also a ferryman, ferrying people across the river in his boat. Satyavati helped her father, the fisherman, in his job and grew up into a beautiful maiden.|$|E

40|$|My {{thesis is}} a {{historical}} and cultural study of how <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> was visualized <b>in</b> Britain circa 1660 - 1775 as well as during the twenty-first century. Prior to the late seventeenth century, <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> was frequently explained as an occult phenomenon, which is to say, as an enigmatic object with inexplicable powers. Because of the social significance and personal investment involved with reproduction, <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> was continually <b>the</b> subject of speculation and conjecture. Additionally, <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> was considered as crucially influencing female well-being, psychology, and sexuality. Following the prerogative of late seventeenth and early eighteenth-century empiricism and human science, <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> was increasingly <b>the</b> subject of inquiry, especially {{as it had been}} long perceived an occluded phenomenon that had been rarely examined or described visually. The progression of the visualization of <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> during <b>the</b> late seventeenth and eighteenth century incorporated and instituted certain features <b>in</b> <b>the</b> visual illustrations that continue to act as precedents for medical scientific uterine imaging today. Having traced the dissolution and influence of earlier occultist beliefs about <b>the</b> <b>womb,</b> I found that a regular set of metaphors were used <b>in</b> explaining <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> during <b>the</b> eighteenth century. These metaphors provided conceptual themes for the anatomical illustrations of <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> that were contemporaneously produced. One such metaphorical understanding was the brain-womb, wherein the brain and <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> were commonly analogized through both literary tropes and medical pathologies. An overarching concept that directed how <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> was understood was the perception that <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> was an autonomous entity within the female body. This precept allowed that <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> could perform various, often malignant, activities that vitally altered the female constitution. The visual images created for anatomical and medical treatises responded to these metaphors and conceptualizations, responses which markedly altered how <b>the</b> <b>womb,</b> reproduction, and <b>the</b> female body were understood. My final consideration relates these metaphorical and conceptual features of eighteenth-century visualizations of <b>the</b> <b>womb</b> to modern-day uterine imaging. Although optical technology has vastly changed between these two eras, many features and conceptualizations have carried forward, crucially informing how we now perceive the uterus...|$|R

The availability of these cultured stem cells eventually made possible the introduction of specific gene alterations into the germ line of mice and the creation of transgenic mice to use as experimental models for human illnesses.|$|R
