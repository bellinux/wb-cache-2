5|$|The Governor {{appoints}} {{almost all}} military and civil {{officers of the}} State government, subject to advice and consent of the Maryland State Senate. The Governor also appoints certain boards and commissions {{in each of the}} 24 Counties and in Baltimore City, such as local Boards of Elections, commissions notaries public, and appoints officers to fill vacancies in the elected offices of Attorney General and Comptroller.

Any officer appointed by the Governor, except a member of the General Assembly, is removable by him or her, if there is a legitimate cause for removal.
