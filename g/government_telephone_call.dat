For example, he worked with Congressman George Miller (D-CA) to craft legislation to protect American teenagers from this institutional abuse.|$|R
40|$|Objective. The {{availability}} {{of health services}} in rural areas creates challenges for the existing providers and health consumers. In preparation for an exploratory study of these issues, we aimed to identify 1) a suitable community to study, and 2) the existing services in this community. Methods. 1) A health services mapping consultant (RE) provided proximity, demographic and preliminary health services data for towns in the Darling Downs region. 2) Services in the identified community/region were confirmed by systematic Internet searches, hard-copy directories, <b>Government</b> databases and <b>telephone</b> <b>calls,</b> using snowballing techniques to saturation. Providers were then confirmed by direct contact. Results. A community comprising 4 towns in the Darling Downs region was selected for study, based on descriptive data and preliminary health services data. Eight health service search engines supplemented direct contact with health providers. A list of 30 types of health and allied health providers was generated. The towns were serviced by 23 - 51 full- and part-time health-care providers and affiliated organisations. Discussion. Further refinement will identify providers aligned with medication services, which will be coded to identify overlap between the towns. Further providers may be identified during data collection in the community exploring specific roles. Acknowledgements. Pharmacists Board of Queensland funding.

40|$|Purpose: Researchers {{have used}} {{unscheduled}} <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> {{for many years}} during clinical trials to measure adult stuttering severity before and after treatment. Because variability is a hallmark of stuttering severity with adults, it is questionable whether an unscheduled <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> is truly representative of their everyday speech. Method: The authors studied the speech of 9 men and 1 woman for a 12 -hr day during different speaking activities. On that day and 1 week prior to that day, participants received an unscheduled 10 -min <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> from a person unknown to them. The authors compared the percent syllables stuttered (%SS) for the unscheduled <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> on the day to the %SS of the unsch eduled <b>telephone</b> <b>call</b> 1 week prior to the day and to the %SS during the entire day. Results: No significant differences were found, and all confidence intervals with t tests included 0. The concordance correlation test also showed a strong positive correlation between %SS scores for the entire day and for the unscheduled 10 -min <b>telephone</b> <b>call.</b> Conclusion: The authors conclude {{that there is no}} reason to doubt that 10 -min unscheduled <b>telephone</b> <b>calls</b> are a representative speech sample for %SS during clinical trials of stuttering treatments...|$|R
