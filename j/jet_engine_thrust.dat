40|$|Jet {{engines are}} {{nonlinear}} dynamical systemsf or which an exact mathematical model cannot be usedf or estimator design, {{because it is}} either not available or so complex {{that it does not}} fit the necessary assumptions. Thus, classical analytical toolsf or studying standard system properties like observability, which is very important in estimator design, cannot be directly applied. Generally, f r practical jet engine applications, the designer f ces two closely related problems: first, given a nonmeasurable parameter, find the minimal set of estimator inputs thatf acilitates achieving a satisf ctory estimation perf ormance (input selection); second, given a predetermined set of inputs, derive an "observability " measure that characterizes the estimation feasib ility of a specific non-measurable parameter.

The conservative nature of the control design results in operating the engine in a less e#cient manner (e. g., at higher temperatures using moref uel) that shortens its lif e.

50|$|Cyclorotors {{provide a}} high degree of control. Traditional propellers, rotors, and <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> produce <b>thrust</b> only along their axis of {{rotation}} and require rotation of the entire device to alter the thrust direction. This rotation requires large forces and comparatively long time scales since the propeller inertia is considerable, and the rotor gyroscopic forces resist rotation. For many practical applications (helicopters, airplanes, ships) this requires rotating the entire vessel. In contrast, cyclorotors need only to vary the blade pitch motions. Since there is little inertia associated with blade pitch change, thrust vectoring in the plane perpendicular to the axis of rotation is rapid.|$|R

40|$|The {{purpose of}} this paper is to set up a method to {{determine}} the missing engine design parameters (turbine inlet temperature T 3 T, airflow rate) which significantly influence the <b>jet</b> <b>engines</b> <b>thrust.</b> The authors have introduced a new non-linear equation connecting the fan specific work with the temperature T 3 T, customized for turbofan. The method of chords, since it converges unconditionally, has been used for solving the non-linear equation of variable temperature T 3 T. An alternate method, based for the same relation between fan specific work and T 3 T, has been presented in purpose to determine airflow rate and fan pressure ratio. Two mixed flows turbofans have been considered as study cases. For case # 1 it was determined a value comparable to the Turbomeca Larzac turbofan series 04 -C 6 and 04 -C 20 which power the AlphaJet machines (series A - Luftwaffe, series E - Dassault Dornier). For the F 100 -PW 229 turbofan, as case # 2, being given T 3 T, then have been determined the airflow rate, fan pressure ratio and fan specific work. After completing the mathematical model with the missing parameters, the performances of the engines at off-design regimes and the operational envelopes revealing i. e. the variations of thrust, specific thrust and fuel specific consumption with altitude and Mach number have been calculated. ...|$|R
50|$|Another area {{of concern}} for {{continued}} high-speed operation is the <b>engines.</b> <b>Jet</b> <b>engines</b> create <b>thrust</b> by increasing {{the temperature of the}} air they ingest, and as the aircraft speeds up, friction and compression heats this air before it reaches the engines. The maximum allowable temperature of the exhaust is determined by the materials in the turbine {{at the rear of the}} engine, so as the aircraft speeds up, the difference in intake and exhaust temperature that the engine can create decreases, and the thrust along with it. Air cooling the turbine area to allow operations at higher temperatures was a key solution, one that continued to improve through the 1950s and on to this day.|$|R
