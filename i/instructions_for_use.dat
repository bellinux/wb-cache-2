The wartime counter was a pierced card glued to a flat backing card; the front card contained strips printed with numerals and with slider-indicators. The numerals represented rows, increase or decrease, and times, as in previous complex counters; {{it also had}} a needle gauge and five-inch measure. The reverse contained <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>use,</b> and the legend: [...] "a handy help for the war-time knitter".

The Grete Herball contains extensive information on plant life as well as entries on animals, comestibles, and minerals.

6000|$|It consorted somehow {{with this}} wealth of {{resource}} in {{her that she}} appeared at the soirées, or {{at least at the}} great fancy-dress soirée in which the historic truth of my experience, free lemonade and all, is doubtless really shut up, as the [...] "genius of California," [...] a dazzling vision of white satin and golden flounces--her brother meanwhile maintaining that more distinctively European colour which I feel to have been for my young presumption the convincing essence of the scene in the character of a mousquetaire de Louis Quinze, highly consonant with his type. There hovered in the background a flushed, full-chested and tawnily short-bearded M. Dubreuil, who, as a singer of the heavy order, at the Opera, carried us off into larger things still--the Opera having at last about then, after dwelling for years, down town, in shifty tents and tabernacles, set up its own spacious pavilion and reared its head as the Academy of Music: all at the end, or what served for the end, of our very street, where, though it wasn't exactly near and Union Square bristled between, I could yet occasionally gape at the great bills beside the portal, in which M. Dubreuil always so serviceably came in {{at the bottom of the}} cast. A subordinate artist, a [...] "grand utility" [...] at the best, I believe, and presently to become, on that scene, slightly ragged I fear even in its freshness, permanent stage-manager or, as we say nowadays, producer, he had yet eminently, to my imagination, the richer, the [...] "European" [...] value; especially for instance when our air thrilled, in the sense that our attentive parents re-echoed, with the visit of the great Grisi and the great Mario, and I seemed, though the art of advertisement was then comparatively so young and so chaste, to see our personal acquaintance, as he could almost be called, thickly sandwiched between them. Such was one's strange sense for the connections of things that they drew out the halls of Ferrero till these too seemed fairly to resound with Norma and Lucrezia Borgia, as if opening straight upon the stage, and Europe, by the stroke, had come to us in such force that we had but to enjoy it on the spot. That could never have been more the case than on the occasion of my assuming, for the famous fancy-ball--not at the operatic Academy, but at the dancing-school, which came so nearly to the same thing--the dress of a débardeur, whatever that might be, which carried in its puckered folds of dark green relieved with scarlet and silver such an exotic fragrance and appealed to me by such a legend. The legend had come round to us, it was true, by way of Albany, whence we learned at the moment of our need, that one of the adventures, one of the least lamentable, of our cousin Johnny had been his figuring as a débardeur at some Parisian revel; the elegant evidence of which, neatly packed, though with but vague <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>use,</b> was helpfully sent on to us. The <b>instructions</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> were in fact so vague that I was afterward to become a bit ruefully conscious of having sadly dishonoured, or at least abbreviated, my model. I fell, that is I stood, short of my proper form by no less than half a leg; the essence of the débardeur being, it appeared, that he emerged at the knees, in white silk stockings and with neat calves, from the beribboned breeches which I artlessly suffered to flap at my ankles. The discovery, after the fact, was disconcerting--yet had been best made withal, too late; for it would have seemed, I conceive, a less monstrous act to attempt to lengthen my legs than to shorten Johnny's culotte. The trouble had been that we hadn't really known what a débardeur was, and I am not sure indeed that I know to this day. It had been more fatal still that even fond Albany couldn't tell us.|$|E

40|$|The Endurant stent-graft (Medtronic, Inc., Minneapolis, MN, USA) is a latest {{generation}} device {{for the treatment}} of abdominal aortic aneurysm. The idea behind designing such a graft came from the intention to broad the <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> (IFU) and to enable it to treat more challenging anatomy including the 10 mm neck lengths, and more severe suprarenal and infrarenal angulations. Endurant stent-graft has active fixation through suprarenal stent with anchoring pins to provide migration resistance, optimized heights of stents and spacing between them for improved flexibility and conformability, low-profile delivery system with hydrophilic coating and controlled simple deployment mechanism. Short term results are excellent. Technical and clinical success is confirmed in Regulatory trials (EU and USA), as well as in ENGAGE and the Canadian registry. Many current publications record the use of Endurant stent-graft outside the <b>Instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use.</b> The results in a group of patients outside the <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> <b>use</b> are comparable to those within <b>instruction</b> <b>for</b> use; with the exception of perioperative proximal endoleak type I.
