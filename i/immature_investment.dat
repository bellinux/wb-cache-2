40|$|When first {{proposed}} {{the conception of}} IPO underpricing, this topic have sparked concerns. Various studies demonstrate that this phenomenon is widespread in global stock market. This dissertation reviews western theories and empirical studies towards Chinese stock market and other markets. Further, this study collects 317 samples of IPO shares from 2009 to 2012 and uses the multiple regression analysis method to test the determinants of IPO underpricing. The results present three primary factors for underpricing in growth enterprise market (GEM). The first is the information asymmetry caused by inefficient regulation. The second reason is the <b>immature</b> <b>investment</b> behavior. Investors in GEM and Chinese financial markets prefer speculation behavior. Third, the variables of special characteristics in Chinese stock market confirm that the inequity {{of supply and demand}} is still an issue after a series of IPO reforms...|$|E
30|$|The {{structure}} of multi-stage compression, inter-stage and post-stage cooling composed of axial compressor in low-pressure stage, and centrifugal compressor in high-pressure stage {{has been adopted}} frequently {{in the design of}} large scale CAES power plant. This compression scheme is mature in terms of designing and manufacturing and has been adopted by Huntorf and McIntosh CAES plants [5]. However, for the advanced adiabatic CAES (AA-CAES), the axial or centrifugal compressor, which processes better performance, large pressure ratio and high temperature rise should be deployed to ensure the high adiabatic compression efficiency to suffer from higher pressure ratio and exhaust temperature, as utilized in the ADELE NSF-CAES started in 2010 and progresses slowly because of the <b>immature</b> technology and <b>investment</b> cost issue [2].|$|R
40|$|Constrained housing supply {{coupled with}} rapid {{urbanisation}} and a volatile domestic credit market have put affordable rental housing development under the spotlight. Addressing this demands appropriate and deliberate capital provisions to induce the property development market {{to deliver the}} scale needed to tackle the supply-side of the problem. Inducements are needed for residential property developers to choose to develop high-density affordable rental housing on land that presents great accessibility to economically vibrant nodes, where land is priced at a premium. The greenfield residential property development space {{is in need of}} sophisticated and specific funding interventions to evolve it beyond the sporadic developments we observe located on the urban periphery on cheap land. The benefits of sophisticated funding models in commercial property have seen the widespread proliferation of building and investment activity. Rental housing, however, lags behind owing to an <b>immature</b> market, shallow <b>investment</b> analysis and rudimentary risk-weighted debt-funding solutions. These funding instruments impede developers building affordable housing schemes on well-located parcels of land near existing amenities and profoundly incorporate green technology into buildings. This research presents a proof of concept for a sophisticated model for high-density housing. A largely 'spatial economic' model for risk analysis, it is developed to attain a so-called Probability of Default Ratio ("PDR") by coalescing two formulae regarded as international best-practice: The risk types incorporated into the model are (1) borrower-level credit risk, (2) property/development-level risk, and (3) cash-flow risk factors. The research is proof of concept of a credit risk management tool for impact investment funding model using these formulae and Geographic Information Systems ("GIS"). It calculates the extent of credit risk for income-producing real estate fundamentals and uses endogenous factors- risk factors and drivers associated with the housing scheme to be build and the surrounding area it is to be built in. The study area covers the 336 contiguous municipal wards that make up the Johannesburg, Tshwane and Ekurhuleni metropolitan municipalities...|$|R
