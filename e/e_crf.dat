40|$|The aim of {{this study}} was to {{determine}} which human immunodeficiency virus type 1 (HIV- 1) subtypes were circulating in Australia and to correlate the subtypes with risk factors associated with the acquisition of HIV- 1 infection. DNA was extracted from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, and HIV- 1 env genes were amplified and subtyped using heteroduplex mobility analysis, with selected samples sequenced and phylogenetic analysis performed. The HIV- 1 env subtypes were determined for 141 samples, of which 40 were from female patients and 101 were from male patients; 13 samples were from children. Forty-seven patients were infected by homosexual or bisexual contact, 46 were infected through heterosexual contact, 21 were infected from injecting drug use (IDU), 13 were infected by vertical transmission, 8 were infected from nosocomial exposure, and 6 were infected by other modes of transmission, including exposure to blood products, ritualistic practices, and two cases of intrafamilial transmission. Five subtypes were detected; B (n = 104), A (n = 5), C (n = 17), <b>E</b> (<b>CRF</b> 01 _AE; n = 13), and G (n = 2). Subtype B predominated in HIV- 1 acquired homosexually (94 % of cases) and by IDU (100 %), whereas non-subtype B infections were mostly seen in heterosexually (57 %) or vertically (22 %) acquired HIV- 1 infections and were usually imported from Africa and Asia. Subtype B strains of group M viruses predominate in Australia in HIV- 1 transmitted by homosexual or bisexual contact and IDU. However, non-B subtypes have been introduced, mostly acquired via heterosexual contact...|$|E
40|$|A human {{immunodeficiency}} virus type 1 (HIV- 1) subtype <b>E</b> (<b>CRF</b> 01 _AE) variant (99 JP-NH 3 -II) possessing an in-frame 33 -nucleotide insertion mutation in the β 3 -β 4 loop coding region of the reverse transcriptase (RT) gene was isolated from a patient who had not responded to nucleoside analogue RT inhibitors. This virus exhibited an extremely high level of multiple nucleoside analog resistance (MNR). Neighbor-joining tree analysis of the pol sequences indicated that the 99 JP-NH 3 -II variant had originated from the swarm of drug-sensitive predecessors in the patient. Population-based sequence analyses of 82 independently cloned RT segments from the patient suggested that the variants with the insertion, three or four 3 ′-azido- 3 ′-deoxythymidine resistance mutations, and a T 69 I mutation in combination had strong selective advantages during chemotherapy. Consistently, in vitro mutagenesis of a drug-sensitive predecessor virus clone demonstrated that this mutation set functions cooperatively to confer {{a high level of}} MNR without deleterious effects on viral replication capability. Homology modeling of the parental RT and its MNR mutant showed that extension of the β 3 -β 4 loop by an insertion caused reductions in the distances between the loop and the other subdomains, narrowing the template-primer binding cleft and deoxynucleoside triphosphate-binding pocket in a highly flexible manner. The origin of the insert is elusive, as every effort to find a homologue has been unsuccessful. Taken together, these data suggest that (i) HIV- 1 tolerates in vivo insertions as long as 33 nucleotides into the highly conserved enzyme gene to survive multiple anti-HIV- 1 inhibitors and (ii) the insertion mutation augments multiple-drug resistance, possibly by reducing the biochemical inaccuracy of substrate-enzyme interactions in the active center...|$|E
40|$|O objetivo do estudo foi avaliar a efetividade de dois procedimentos, Tentativa Discreta (TD) e Tentativa Discreta com Intervalo entre as Respostas (TD/IRI), na produção da variabilidade comportamental em diferentes condições (diretamente reforçada e induzida) e averiguar que condição, em cada procedimento, mais facilitaria a seleção de uma sequência de baixa probabilidade inicial. Selecionou-se 18 universitários com um desempenho na linha de base, medido pelo índice U, igual ou {{inferior}} a 0, 5. Estes foram divididos nos dois procedimentos e subdivididos em três grupos com três participantes (VAR, ACO e CON). A tarefa consistia em formar figuras na tela do computador pressionando duas teclas (direita e esquerda) de teclados laterais. A unidade comportamental era quatro respostas às teclas. Nos dois procedimentos apresentava-se um pedaço da figura, um tom e 0, 5 segundo, caso a sequência fosse passível de reforço, e um timeout de 1, 0 segundo, caso não fosse. Somente no TD/IRI havia um IRI de 0, 5 segundo após as três primeiras respostas da sequência. O experimento continha três fases. Na Fase 1, linha de base, vigorava o reforçamento contínuo (CRF) das 16 sequências. Para dois grupos (TD-VAR e TD/IRI-VAR) na Fase 2 havia o reforçamento direto da variabilidade, para 15 sequências, no qual a sequência menos frequente e menos recente teria maior probabilidade de ser reforçada, <b>e</b> <b>CRF</b> de uma sequência alvo (sequência menos frequente na linha de base). Na Fase 3, havia a distribuição acoplada dos reforços da fase anterior para as 15 sequências <b>e</b> <b>CRF</b> de outra sequência alvo. Para os grupos TD-ACO e TD/IRI-ACO a ordem de exposição às fases foi inversa, visto que na Fase 2 a distribuição de reforços foi acoplada ao desempenho dos participantes dos grupos VAR. Nos grupos TD-CON e TD/IRI-CON havia somente o CRF da sequência alvo nas duas fases. Os resultados mostraram que a variabilidade aumentou na primeira sessão da Fase 2 para todos os participantes. O grupo TD-ACO foi o que apresentou maior índices de variabilidade dentro deste procedimento. Já no TD/IRI, isto foi verdadeiro para o grupo TD/IRI-VAR. Com relação à seleção da sequência alvo, os grupos que apresentaram maiores porcentagens de seleção em todas as sessões foram TD-CON e TD/IRI-VAR, respectivamente dentro de cada procedimento. Notou-se que os dois procedimentos produziram seleção da sequência alvo, mas parece que o uso do IRI produziu um responder mais variável, quando este foi diretamente reforçado, o que possibilitou que a seleção da sequência alvo ocorresse mais rapidamenteThe aim of {{this study}} was to evaluate the effectiveness of two procedures, Discrete Trial (DT) and Discrete Trial with Interresponse Interval (DT/IRI), on the production of behavioral variability in different conditions (directly reinforced and induced) and determine what condition, in each procedure, would facilitate the selection of an initial sequence of low probability. Were selected 18 college students with baseline performance measured by U-valeu, that was equal or less than 0, 5. They were divided into the two procedures and subdivided into three groups with three participants (VAR, YOKE and CON). The task was to form images on the computer screen by pressing two keys (left and right) on lateral keyboards. The unit was four responses to the keys. In both procedures, a piece of the image, a tone and 0, 5 seconds was used to reinforce sequences that attended the contingency s criterion, and a timeout of 1, 0 second, if not. Only the DT/IRI had a 0, 5 second interval after the first three responses of the sequence. The experiment had three phases. In Phase I, baseline, sequences was continuous reinforced (CRF). For two groups (DT- VAR and DT/IRI-VAR) in Phase 2, variability was direct reinforced on 15 sequences, mean that the less frequent and less recent sequence had more probability of been reinforced than the others, and a target sequence (less frequent sequence at baseline) was reinforced in CRF. In Phase 3, the distribution of reinforcement of the prior phase was yoked for the 15 sequences and another target sequence was reinforced in CRF. For the groups DT-YOKE and DT/IRI-YOKE, the phase s exposure was reversed, whereas in Phase 2 the distribution of reinforcement was yoked to the performance of the VAR groups. In groups DT-CON and DT/IRI-CON, only the target sequence was reinforced in both phases. The results showed that variability increased in the first session of Phase 2 for all participants. The DT-YOKE group showed the highest levels of variability within this procedure. In the DT/IRI procedure, this was true for the group DT/IRI-VAR. With regard to the selection of the target sequence the groups that had higher percentages of selection in all sessions were DT-CON and DT/IRI-VAR, respectively within each procedure. It was noted that both procedures produced the selection of the target sequence, but is seems that the use of IRI produced a more variable performance, when it was directly reinforced, allowing the selection of the target sequence to occur more rapidl...|$|E

This {{leads to a}} need for approximate training methods. Unfortunately, knowledge about how to perform efficient and effective approximate training is limited. Focusing on structural SVMs, we provide and explore algorithms for two different classes of approximate training algorithms, which we call undergenerating (e. g., greedy) and overgenerating (e. g., relaxations) algorithms. We provide a theoretical and empirical analysis of both types of approximate trained structural SVMs, focusing on fully connected pairwise Markov random fields. We find that models trained with overgenerating methods have theoretic advantages over undergenerating methods, are empirically robust relative to their undergenerating brethren, and relaxed trained models favor non-fractional predictions from relaxed predictors. 1...|$|R

40|$|Introdução: A alteração no desenvolvimento pulmonar em prematuros é caracterizada por redução na alveolarização e vascularização dismórfica. Tem sido considerada a possibilidade de que alterações associadas a fatores perinatais diminuam volumes pulmonares e a qualidade da distribuição da ventilação. Objetivo: Medir a heterogeneidade da ventilação e a capacidade {{residual}} funcional em prematuros e estudar suas associações com fatores perinatais. Métodos: Este é um estudo transversal envolvendo prematuros com idade corrigida de 8 a 13 meses. Foram medidas a capacidade residual funcional (CRF) e a ventilação heterogênea utilizando o lung clearence índex (LCI) através da técnica multiple breath {{inert gas}} washout (MBW) com hexafluoreto de enxofre (SF 6) a 4 %, com sedação, usando um medidor de fluxo ultrassônico. Na análise estatística foi usado o teste t de Student e a regressão linear. Resultados: Foram estudados 28 prematuros com idade gestacional (IG) (média±dp) de 31 ± 2, 9 semanas, com LCI de 7, 88 ± 0, 6 <b>e</b> <b>CRF</b> igual a 19, 7 ± 4, 3 ml. kg- 1. Houve correlação positiva entre LCI e sexo masculino e restrição do crescimento intrauterino (RCIU) (p< 0, 05). Houve correlação negativa entre LCI e ruptura prematura das membranas (ruprema) (p< 0, 05). Conclusão: Os resultados encontrados sugerem, que nesta amostra, o sexo masculino, o RCIU e a ruprema influenciaram o LCI em prematuros. A CRF não foi associada à prematuridade ou outros fatores perinatais. Background: Alterations to lung development in preterm infants {{is characterized by}} decreased alveolarization and dysmorphic vasculature. Has been considered the possibility that changes associated with perinatal factors decrease lung volume and quality of ventilation distribution. Objective: To measure the functional residual capacity and heterogeneity of ventilation in preterm infants and to study their association with perinatal factors. Methods: This is a cross-sectional study involving preterm infants corrected age of 8 to 13 months. Were measured at functional residual capacity (FRC) and ventilation inhomogeneity using the lung clearance index (LCI) by the technique multiple breath inert gas washout (MBW) with sulfur hexafluoride (SF 6) to 4 %, with sedation, using a ultrasonic flowmeter. The statistical analysis used the Student t test and linear regression. Results: We studied 28 preterm infants with gestational age (GA) (mean ±SD) of 31 ± 2. 9 weeks, with of 7. 88 ± 0. 6 and equal to 19. 7 ± 4. 3 ml. kg- 1. Positive correlation were found between LCI and males and intrauterine growth restriction (p < 0. 05). Premature rupture of membranes were negative correlation with LCI (p < 0. 05). Conclusion: The results suggest that this sample, male sex, the IUGR and premature rupture of membranes affect LCI in preterm infants.

40|$|HIV {{clinics in}} Canada provide care to an {{increasing}} number of patients born outside of Canada with HIV- 1 non-B subtype infections. Because the Easy Q HIV- 1 v 1. 2 assay (EQ; bioMérieux) failed to detect some non-B subtype infections, a multiassay HIV- 1 viral load (VL) study was conducted with patients with diverse HIV subtype infections. Patients were enrolled from the Southern Alberta HIV Clinic (SAC), Calgary, Alberta, Canada (n = 349) and the McGill HIV Clinic (MHC), Montreal, Quebec, Canada (n = 20) and had four or five tubes of blood drawn for testing by EQ and three other commercial HIV VL assays: (i) the Versant 3. 0 HIV- 1 test, with the Versant 440 instrument (branched DNA [bDNA]; Siemens), (ii) the RealTime HIV- 1 test, with the m 2000 rt instrument (m 2000 rt; Abbott Molecular Diagnostics), and (iii) the COBAS AmpliPrep TaqMan HIV- 1 48 test (CAP-CTM; Roche Molecular Diagnostics). Blood was processed according to the individual manufacturer's requirements and stored frozen at − 86 °C. The HIV subtype was known for patients who had undergone HIV genotypic resistance testing (Virco, Belgium). Data analyses were done using standard statistical methods within Stata 9. 0 (StataCorp, College Station, TX). A total of 371 samples were tested on 369 patients, of whom 291 (81 %) had a Virco genotype result of B (195; 53 %) or non-B (96; 26 %) subtypes A to D and F to K, as well as circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) (i. <b>e.,</b> <b>CRF</b> 01 _AE and CRF 02 _AG). Most (58 / 78; 74 %) patients of unknown subtype were recent African emigrants who likely have non-subtype B infection. Overall bias was small in pairwise Bland-Altman plots, but the limits of agreement between assays were wide. Discordant viral load results occurred for 98 samples and were due to missing values, false negatives, and significant underquantification that varied by HIV subtype. Results were obtained for all 371 samples with m 2000 rt, but for only 357 (97 %) with CAP-CTM, 338 (92 %) with EQ, and 276 (75 %) with bDNA due to errors/equipment failures. False-negative results (nondetection of viral RNA versus other assay results) occurred for all platforms, as follows: for m 2000 rt, 8 (2 %) [B(4) and non-B(4) subtypes], CAP-CTM, 9 (2. 5 %) [B(6) and non-B(3) subtypes]; EQ, 20 (6 %) [B(7) and non-B(13) subtypes]; bDNA, 5 (2 %) [B(1) and C(4) ]. EQ and bDNA had the highest rates of underquantification by ≥ 1. 0 log 10 copies/ml, mainly for HIV non-B subtypes. Performance significantly varied between HIV VL platforms according to subtype. HIV viral diversity in the population being tested must be considered in selection of the viral load platform...|$|E
40|$|PURPOSE: To {{evaluate}} the sensitivity, specificity, and test accuracy of corneal biomechanical metrics and anterior segment data in differentiating keratoconus from healthy corneas. METHODS: Comparative case series. Patients {{with and without}} keratoconus (gender and age-matched) were submitted for complete eye examinations including corneal hysteresis (CH) and corneal resistance factor (CRF) {{as measured by the}} Ocular Response Analyzer and anterior segment data as gathered through Pentacam assessments. The anterior segment data measurement included average central keratometric readings (K-Ave), corneal astigmatism (CA), central corneal thickness (CCT), anterior chamber depth (AC depth) and corneal volume (CV). All parameters were assessed, compared and analyzed. A receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve was used to identify the best cutoff point by which to maximize the sensitivity and specificity of discriminating keratoconus from normal corneas for each data category. RESULTS: Seventy seven eyes from forty three patients (24 male, 19 female) with keratoconus and eighty six eyes from forty three (24 male, 19 female) healthy controls were enrolled. ROC curve analysis showed poor overall predictive accuracy for all studied parameters in differentiating keratoconus from normal corneas. The highest sensitivity (79. 2 %) was obtained for both AC depth and CH (cutoff points 3. 22 mm and 9. 39 mmHg respectively). The best specificity (89. 5 %) and test accuracy (80. 34 %) were obtained for CA (cutoff point of 2. 2 D). CONCLUSION: When considered together, studied parameters showed statistical differences between groups. However, when considered independently they presented low sensitivity, specificity and test accuracy in differentiating keratoconus from healthy corneas. OBJETIVO: Avaliar a sensibilidade, especificidade e acurácia de parâmetros biomecânicos e anatômicos do segmento anterior isolados na diferenciação de córneas saudáveis e com ceratocone. MÉTODOS: Estudo tipo série de casos comparativa. Pacientes com ceratocone e controles saudáveis foram pareados (idade e sexo) e submetidos a exame oftalmológico completo, incluindo avaliação biomecânica (ORA) e tomográfica (Pentacam). Ceratometria central média, astigmatismo corneano, espessura corneana central, profundidade da câmara anterior, volume corneano, CH <b>e</b> <b>CRF</b> foram estabelecidos, avaliados e comparados. Curvas ROC (Receiver operating characteristic) foram utilizadas para identificar o melhor valor de corte que apresentasse a maior sensibilidade e especificidade na discriminação entre ceratocone e córneas saudáveis para cada dado estudado. RESULTADOS: Setenta e sete olhos de 43 pacientes com ceratocone (24 homens e 19 mulheres) e 86 olhos de pacientes saudáveis (24 homens e 19 mulheres) foram incluídos no estudo. Curvas ROC mostraram baixa acurácia na predição do diagnóstico de ceratocone em todos os parâmetros isolados estudados. Maior sensibilidade encontrada foi 79, 2 % para profundidade da câmara anterior e CH (ponto de corte 3, 22 mm e 9, 39 mmHg respectivamente); maior especificidade e acurácia foram encontradas na análise do astigmatismo corneano (ponto de corte 2, 2 D; 89, 5 % e 80, 34 % respectivamente).

40|$|Up to now, {{all known}} env subtype <b>E</b> viruses (<b>CRF</b> 01 -AE) {{have had the}} same mosaic {{structure}} with subtype A, and no other env subtype E HIV- 1 viruses with non-A subtypes in their genomes have been described. In this report, we describe the full-length genome sequence of an env subtype E isolate with a recombinant genome different from the prototype CRF 01 -AE strains. The 97 CD-KTB- 49 strain, obtained from a tuberculosis patient in Kinshasa, has a complex mosaic genome involving subtypes A, E, G, H, J, K, and several unknown fragments. The U sequences formed well-separated clusters together with previously described unknown fragments from CRF 04 -cpx (subtype I), and from Z 321, the oldest intersubtype recombinant isolated in 1976 in the Democratic Republic of Congo. The complex recombinant virus from our study is not an isolated strain; partial sequencing of a second strain, 97 CD-KFE 45, confirmed the breakpoints observed in the 97 CD-KTB- 49 strain in the regions sequenced. The complexity of these recombinant strains suggests a longstanding presence of subtype E in Central Africa. (Résumé d'auteur...|$|R
40|$|Renal failure {{involves}} a significant impairment {{of the essential}} functions of the kidney, which can be either acute with sudden and rapid onset (acute renal failure [ARF]) or chronic with gradual onset (chronic renal failure [CRF]). ARF, if detected early, may be halted or reversed, whereas CRF is generally irreversible. Without treatment or intervention, both forms of renal failure lead to end stage renal failure (ESRF) or end stage renal disease (ESRD), requiring renal replacement therapy (RRT) {{in the form of}} dialysis or renal transplantation for survival. However, provision of RRT requires expert teams working in specialised units, making therapy of patients with renal failure expensive; furthermore, RRT is complex, with its own complications. Although pharmacological interventions have shown promise in experimental models, these have not been as successful in the clinical setting (e. g., administration of atrial natriuretic peptide, low-dose dopamine). At present, drugs are administered during CRF to either reduce one of the many risk factors of <b>CRF</b> (<b>e.</b> g., angiotensin-converting enzyme inhibitors, statins) or to deal with the consequences of <b>CRF</b> (<b>e.</b> g., erythropoietin, calcitriol). Recent evidence suggests that some of these interventions may provide further direct beneficial effects via reduction of renal inflammation. Although these interventions have greatly improved the prospects for patients suffering ESRF, the development of novel drugs and therapies with which to reduce the consequences of renal failure and ESRD remain topics of great interest. This article reviews the therapies available for the prevention and management of renal failure in adults and describes, in detail, emerging drugs and novel interventions that may soon become available for the treatment or prevention of ESRF. ...|$|R

40|$|O grupo M do HIV - 1 envolve a maioria das infec????es mundiais e ?? composto por nove subtipos, denominados de A-K. Esta intensa variabilidade gen??tica reflete-se no surgimento part??culas virais com diferentes comportamentos biol??gicos. Estes representam os principais obst??culos para a efici??ncia da resposta imune humana e para o desenvolvimento de vacinas e terapias universais. O estudo {{molecular}} e biol??gico do HIV pode contribuir para o melhor entendimento de suas propriedades, para a escolha adequada de estrat??gias terap??uticas e para a vigil??ncia da epidemia de HIV / AIDS. O objetivo deste trabalho foi investigar o perfil epidemiol??gico e molecular do HIV - 1 no estado da Bahia. Para tanto, foram estudadas amostras de DNA provenientes de 261 indiv??duos infectados pelo HIV, acompanhados em um hospital de Salvador, {{a capital}} do estado. Destas, 228 e 208 amostras foram analisadas atrav??s de HMA nos genes gag e env, respectivamente, e 175 foram caracterizadas em ambos os genes. Adicionalmente, 32 amostras de subtipos F e recombinantes BF foram seq??enciadas e analisadas atrav??s de m??todos filogen??ticos. Uma propor????o significativa de resultados divergentes entre o HMA e as an??lises filogen??ticas foi observada (84. 4 %). Os resultados combinados mostraram sete diferentes gen??tipos de HIV - 1 : 147 (84 %) B/B, 4 (2. 3 %) F/F, 3 (1. 7 %) B/F, 1 (0. 6 %) F/B, 1 (0. 6 %) FIO, 1 (0. 6 %) BF/F e 18 (10. 3 %) BF/B. As seq????ncias recombinantes BF n??o foram relacionadas ?? Forma Recombinante Circulante (CRF) CRF 12, enquanto apenas duas foram relacionadas ?? CRF 28 <b>e</b> ?? <b>CRF</b> 29. 19 variantes BF compartilharam o mesmo ponto de recombina????o em gago Em adi????o, 7 recombinantes BF circulantes na regi??o de Feira de Santana apresentando padr??o similar de recombina????o, mostraram-se filogeneticamente relacionados aos recombinantes encontrados em Salvador. Em conclus??o, o subtipo B ?? o gen??tipo predominante, entretanto, a preval??ncia (13. 1 %) de variantes BF divergentes entre si e uma poss??vel nova CRF sugerem que recombina????o gen??tica est?? ocorrendo :&eq??entemente nesta regi??o do pa??s. O uso da t??cnica de HMA n??o ?? apropriado em regi??es onde diferentes subtipos est??o co-circulando e onde a presen??a de v??rus recombinantes ?? esperada. A epidemia de HIV / AIDS local caracteriza-se por um crescente n??mero de casos entre mulheres e associada a transmiss??o por via heterossexual. Em particular, a epidemia de subtipo F na Bahia est?? relacionada aos indiv??duos do sexo feminino e ?? via de transmiss??o heterossexual. A presen??a de um v??rus recombinante FIO foi reportado pela primeira vez no Brasil. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus 1 (HIV -I) {{is characterized by}} high levels of genetic variability. The majority of the HIV-I infections worldwide is caused by group M strains, which have been c 1 assified into 9 different genetic subtypes (A-K). As a result ofthis great genetic variability, the virus is also characterized by a diversity of phenotypes, which represents a major obstac 1 e to the immune system function and to the long-term efficiency of antiretroviral therapy. Therefore, studies involving molecular and biological aspects of HIV-I {{can contribute to the}} understanding of its properties, the development of therapeutic and control strategies, and the monitoring of the HIV / AIDS epidemic. The aim {{of this study is to}} investigate the epidemiological and genetic variability of HIV -I in the Brazilian state of Bahia. DNA samples from 229 and 213 HIV-I-infected individuaIs followed at a hospital in Salvador, the capital of Bahia, were analyzed using the Heteroduplex Mobility Assay (HMA) in gag and env genes, respectively. Out of these, 175 samples were characterized in both genes. Thirty-two subtype F and BF recombinant viruses were sequenced and analyzed by phylogenetic methods. The combined data showed that seven different HIV -I genotypes comprised this sample: 147 (84 %) B/B, 4 (2. 3 %) F/F, 3 (1. 7 %) B/F, 1 (0. 6 %) F/B, 1 (0. 6 %) F/D, I (0. 6 %) BF/F, and 18 (10. 3 %) BF/B. A significant divergence was observed between the HMA and the sequencing results (84. 4 %). This could be explained by the low accuracy of the HMA for detecting recombinant viruses. These variants were unrelated to CRFI 2, while two sequences were related to CRF 28 and CRF 29. Nineteen BF mosaics shared the same gag breakpoint. In addition, 7 BF recombinants from the city Feira de Santana presenting the same recombination pattern were related to the variants found in Salvador in the phylogenetic analysis. In conc 1 usion, subtype B is the most common genotype, however, an increasing prevalence (13. 1 %) of different BF variants and a potentially new CRF suggest that recombination is occurring frequent 1 y in Bahia. The use of HMA may be inappropriate in regions where different subtypes are co-circulating. The local HIV / AIDS epidemic follows the national epidemiological trends being mainly associated with heterosexual transmission and with an increasing number of cases among women. The subtype F epidemic was associated with women infected heterosexually. Finally, this study identified the presence of an F /D recombinant HIV -I in Brazil...|$|E
40|$|Metacontingências são o produto e o processo de seleção de práticas culturais no terceiro nível de seleção por consequências, em que variação é requisito {{fundamental}} para ocorrência de seleção. Três experimentos foram conduzidos com os objetivos de investigar os efeitos de esquemas análogos a esquemas de reforçamento diferencial de variabilidade LAG <b>e</b> <b>CRF</b> em relação à variabilidade comportamental em processos de seleção cultural; e de averiguar de que maneira maior ou menor variabilidade ao longo desses processos afetariam a seleção de uma nova metacontingência, diante de uma mudança no critério de apresentação das consequências culturais. No Experimento I, 21 participantes trabalharam em trios, vigorando esquemas análogos a LAG 2 e LAG 1 em relação a produtos das respostas de inserção de números de 0 a 9 em caselas dispostas nas telas de computadores. Exigiu-se, como condição para a apresentação de consequências culturais (bônus), que um produto agregado (PA) caracterizado por uma determinada relação entre as somas dos números inseridos pelos participantes e pela não-repetição das somas entre ciclos, de acordo com o n do LAG, fosse produzido. Observou-se que não houve produção sistemática desse PA por mais de duas gerações consecutivas de participantes e que apenas a relação entre as somas especificada recorreu por diversas gerações, observando-se estereotipias nas topografias das respostas operantes e nas somas. Diante da mudança no critério de apresentação da consequência cultural, caracterizada por uma relação diferente da anterior entre as somas (novo PA), ocorreu a seleção de/por metacontingências e transmissão cultural, novamente observando-se a geração de estereotipias. No segundo experimento, que contou com 14 participantes, fases experimentais semelhantes foram conduzidas, exceto que não houve uma fase em que esquemas análogos a LAG vigoraram. Averiguou-se que a seleção de/por metacontingências e sua transmissão ocorreram nessas condições e, diante de mudança no critério de apresentação da consequência cultural, nova seleção cultural foi observada em momento próximo ao verificado no experimento anterior, ocorrendo também a transmissão da prática. Estereotipias comportamentais foram notadas, principalmente no primeiro processo de seleção cultural descrito. Houve 18 participantes no terceiro experimento, em que se implementou um esquema análogo a LAG 1 para as somas; após 13 gerações de participantes, a seleção de/ por metacontingências com esse esquema em vigor pôde ser constatada, bem como sua transmissão. Foi observada maior variabilidade nas topografias de respostas e somas, mas padrões que indicaram restrição na variação comportamental foram identificados diante da ocorrência da seleção cultural. Constatou-se que a introdução de esquemas análogos a LAG teve como efeito dificultar a seleção de/ por metacontingências e que uma nova seleção cultural ocorreu rapidamente a despeito de haver maior ou menor variabilidade comportamental nas histórias de microculturas, anteriormente à mudança de critério para apresentação da consequência cultural de microculturas. Metacontingencies are {{the product}} {{and the process of}} selection of cultural practices in the third level of selection by consequences, in which variation is a fundamental requisite for selection to occur. Three experiments were conducted with the objectives of investigate the effects of schemes analogous to differential reinforcement schemes of variability LAG, and CRF, upon the behavior variability in cultural selection processes, and to ascertain in which ways more or less variability along these processes would affect the selection of a new metacontingency, {{in the face of a}} change in the cultural consequences presentation criterion. In the Experiment I, 21 participants worked in trios, under the effect of schemes analogous to LAG 2 and LAG 1 for the products of responses of inserting numbers from 0 to 9 in spots placed in some computers´ screens. It was required, as a condition to the presentation of cultural consequences (bonus), that an aggregate product (PA) featured by an specific relation among the sums of the numbers inserted by the participants and by non-repetition of the sums between cycles, according to the n of the LAG contingence, was produced. It was observed that there wasn´t systematic production of this PA along more than two consecutive generations of participants and that only the specified relation among sums recurred along different generations. Stereotypies in the operant responses´ topographies and in the sums were found. In the face of the change in the criterion of presentation of the cultural consequences, featured by a different relation among the sums (new PA), the selection of/ by metacontingencies and cultural transmission occurred and the production of stereotypies was again observed. In the second experiment, that counted on 14 participants, similar experimental phases were conducted, except that there wasn´t a phase in which schemes analogous to LAG were in effect. The selection of/by metacontingencies and its transmission were verified in these conditions, and when the change in the criterion of presentation of the cultural consequences was made, a new cultural selection was observed in a similar moment of the occurrence of this phenomenon in the previous experiment; the practice was also transmitted. Behavior stereotypies were noticed, mainly in the first process of cultural selection that was described. There were 18 participants in the third experiment, in which a scheme analogous to LAG 1 for the sums was introduced; after 13 generations of participants the selection of/by metacontingencies was ascertained, as well as its transmission. It was observed that there was more variability in the responses topographies and in the sums, but patterns that indicated restrictions in the behavior variability were identified when the cultural selection occurred. It was concluded that the introduction of schemes analogous to LAG hampered the selection of/by metacontingencies and that a new cultural selection happened rapidly, despite of more or less behavioral variability in the microcultures´ stories previously the modification of the criterion related to the presentation of cultural consequence...|$|E

Electrolyte level alterations are also observed in case of CRF patients. Materials and Method: This cross section study includes total 110 subjects. Out of these 60 subjects were clinically diagnosed CRF patients having age more than 20 years and remaining 50 subjects were chosen from healthy controls not having any major medical problem. Among 60 CRF cases, 30 were on maintenance dialysis for a period of 5 months to 3 years. These patients were undergoing dialysis for 3 - 4 hours thrice week, Other 30 patients were on conservative line of treatment. Fasting venous blood samples were collected and serum levels of Total cholesterol, Triglycerides, High density lipoprotein cholesterol, Low density lipoprotein cholesterol, Very low density lipoprotein cholesterol, Serum Na+& K+ were measured. Results: It is seen that Serum K+, total cholesterol, triglyceride, VLDL-C and total cholesterol to HDL-C ratio were significantly increased in CRF on conservative management group as compared controls while mean level of LDL-C did not show any significant difference between these two groups i. <b>e.</b> controls & <b>CRF</b> on conservative management. The mean value of Serum Na+ and HDL-C was significantly decreased in CRF on conservative management as compared to control. It is also observed that Serum K+, total cholesterol, triglyceride, VLDL C and total cholesterol to HDL ratio were significantly increased in CRF on dialysis group as compared controls while mean level of LDL did not show any significant difference between these two groups i. <b>e.</b> controls & <b>CRF</b> on dialysis. The mean value of Serum Na+, HDL-C was significantly decreased in CRF on dialysis group as compared controls.

Commonly employed analysis and classification methods, however, ignored this fact and treated the sleep signals as non-sequence data. Treating the sleep signals as sequences, this paper compared two powerful unsupervised feature extractors and three sequence-based classifiers regarding accuracy and computational (training and testing) time after 10 -folds cross-validation. The compared feature extractors are Deep Belief Networks (DBN) and Fuzzy C-Means (FCM) clustering. Whereas the compared sequence-based classifiers are Hidden Markov Models (HMM), Conditional Random Fields (CRF) and its variants, i. <b>e.,</b> Hidden-state <b>CRF</b> (HCRF) and Latent-Dynamic CRF (LDCRF); and Conditional Neural Fields (CNF) and its variant (LDCNF). In this study, we use two datasets. The first dataset {{is an open}} (public) polysomnographic dataset downloadable from the Internet, while the second dataset is our polysomnographic dataset (also available for download). For the first dataset, the combination of FCM and CNF gives the highest accuracy (96. 75 %) with relatively short training time (0. 33 hours). For the second dataset, the combination of DBN and CRF gives the accuracy of 99. 96 % but with 1. 02 hours training time, whereas the combination of DBN and CNF gives slightly less accuracy (99. 69 %) but also less computation time (0. 89 hours).

40|$|When {{classifying}} high-dimensional sequence data, {{traditional methods}} (<b>e.</b> g., HMMs, <b>CRFs)</b> may require {{large amounts of}} training data to avoid overfitting. In such cases dimensionality reduction can be employed to find a low-dimensional representation on which classification can be done more efficiently. Existing methods for supervised dimensionality reduction often presume that the data is densely sampled so that a neighborhood graph structure can be formed, or that the data arises from a known distribution. Sufficient dimension reduction techniques aim to find a low dimensional representation such that the remaining degrees of freedom become conditionally independent of the output values. In this paper we develop a novel sequence kernel dimension reduction approach (S-KDR). Our approach does not make strong assumptions {{on the distribution of}} the input data. Spatial, temporal and periodic information is combined in a principled manner, and an optimal manifold is learned for the end-task. We demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach on several tasks involving the discrimination of human gesture and motion categories, as well as on a database of dynamic textures. 1...|$|R

In this paper, we address the problem of advice-revealing text unit (ATU) extraction from online forums due to its usefulness in travel domain. We represent advice as a two-tuple comprising an advice-revealing sentence and its context sentences. To extract the advice-revealing sentences, we propose to define the task as a sequence labeling problem, using three different types of features: syntactic, contextual, and semantic features. To extract the context sentences, we propose to use a 2 Di-mensional CRF (2 D-CRF) model, which gives the best per-formance compared to traditional machine learning mod-els. Finally, we present a solution to the integrated problem of extracting both advice-revealing sentences and their re-spective context sentences at the same time using our pro-posed models, i. <b>e.,</b> Multiple Linear <b>CRF</b> (ML-CRF) and 2 Dimensional CRF Plus (2 D-CRF+).

40|$|Semantic image {{segmentation}} {{is an important}} computer vision task that is difficult because it consists of both recognition and segmentation. The task is often cast as a structured output problem on an exponentially large output-space, which is typically modeled by a discrete probabilistic model. The best segmentation is found by inferring the Maximum a-Posteriori (MAP) solution over the output distribution defined by the model. Due to limitations in optimization, the model cannot be arbitrarily complex. This leads to a trade-off: devise a more accurate model that incorporates rich high-order interactions between image elements {{at the cost of}} inaccurate and possibly intractable optimization OR leverage a tractable model which produces less accurate MAP solutions but may contain high quality solutions as other modes of its output distribution. This thesis investigates the latter and presents a two stage approach to semantic segmentation. In the first stage a tractable segmentation model outputs a set of high probability segmentations from the underlying distribution that are not just minor perturbations of each other. Critically the output of this stage is a diverse set of plausible solutions and not just a single one. In the second stage, a discriminatively trained re-ranking model selects the best segmentation from this set. The re-ranking stage can use much more complex features than what could be tractably used in the segmentation model, allowing a better exploration of the solution space than simply returning the MAP solution. The formulation is agnostic to the underlying segmentation model (<b>e.</b> g. <b>CRF,</b> CNN, etc.) and optimization algorithm, which makes it applicable {{to a wide range of}} models and inference methods. Evaluation of the approach on a number of semantic {{image segmentation}} benchmark datasets highlight its superiority over inferring the MAP solution. Comment: PhD Thesis.

40|$|SummaryWhile the {{effectiveness}} of pulmonary rehabilitation (PR) in {{chronic obstructive pulmonary disease}} (COPD) is well established, its effectiveness in the most severe category of COPD, i. e. patients with chronic respiratory failure (CRF), is less well known. ObjectiveTo verify the effects of PR in patients with CRF, and compare the level of improvement with PR in these patients to that of COPDs not affected by CRF. MethodsA multi-centre study was carried out on COPD patients with versus without CRF. The PR program included educational support, exercise training, and nutritional and psychological counselling. Lung function, arterial gases, walk test (6 MWT), dyspnoea (MRC; BDI/TDI), and quality of life (MRF 28; SGRQ) were evaluated. ResultsThousand forty seven consecutive COPD inpatients (327 with CRF) were evaluated. In patients with CRF all parameters improved after PR (0. 001). Mean changes: FEV 1, 112 ml; PaO 2, 3. 0 mmHg; PaCO 2, 3. 3 mmHg; 6 MWT, 48 m; MRC, 0. 85 units; MRF 28 total score, 11. 5 units. These changes were similar to those observed in patients without CRF. ConclusionsThis study, featuring the largest cohort so far reported in the literature, shows that PR is equally effective in the more severe COPD patients, i. <b>e.</b> those with <b>CRF,</b> and supports the prescription of PR also in these patients...|$|R
40|$|I. We {{studied the}} spatial {{interaction}} between stimulus and attention in macaque area V 4. Monkeys {{were required to}} fixate a small spot while continuously attending to a ring-shaped target within a large array of identical rings. Meanwhile, {{the response of the}} V 4 cell under study was tested by flashing behaviorally irrelevant bar stimuli in the cell’s classical receptive field (CRF). The location of the attended ring was varied across four positions surrounding the CRF, and the location of the bar stimulus was varied across five positions spanning the CRF. 2. Response strength depended on two aspects of the spatial relationship between the stimulus driving the cell (the bar) and the position of attention (the target ring). First, for 49 % of the cells studied, responses were greater for bar stimuli near the attended ring; i. e., the receptive field profile shifted toward the attentional focus. Second, for 84 % of the cells, the overall response level depended on the direction in which attention lay relative to the stimulus in the <b>CRF</b> (<b>e.</b> g., to the left, right, above, or below). 3. This study confirms a key prediction of spatial models of attention, which postulate enhanced processing of all stimuli near the attentional focus. It also introduces the novel finding that responses are influenced by the relative direction of attention. This result indicates that area V 4 carries information about the spatial relationship between visual stimuli and attention...|$|R
40|$|ABSTRACT: Corticotropin {{releasing}} factor (CRF), a 41 -amino acid neuropeptide {{widely distributed}} in the mammalian central nervous system, {{has been shown to}} infl uence several gastrointestinal functions. Recent studies show that CRF released locally from enteric nerves may also underlie alterations in gut function. In this study, immunohistochemisty was applied to demonstrate the presence of CRF in the jejunum of sheep. Using double immunohistochemical staining the co-localization of CRF with vasoactive intestinal peptide (VIP), galanin, tyrosine hydroxylase (TH), neuropeptide Y (NPY) and substance P (SP) was evaluated. Th <b>e</b> presence of <b>CRF</b> was detected in myenteric neurons (3. 6 ± 0. 9 %) as well as in submucous neurons (10. 5 ± 1. 2 %). In the ovine jejunum diff erent numbers of CRF-expressing nerve fi bres were detected in myenteric ganglia, submucous ganglia, circular smooth muscle layer, lamina muscularis mucosae and between mucosal glands. None of the CRF-positive enteric neurons and CRF-positive nerve fi bres exhibited the presence of TH. CRF-immunoreactive (IR) myenteric neurons widely co-expressed VIP and/or NPY. A minor population of CRF-IR myenteric neurons additionally co-stored SP. Galanin was not present in CRF-IR myenteric neurons. Th e presence of VIP was observed {{in the vast majority of}} CRF-positive submucous neurons. Moderate numbers of CRF-IR sumbucous neurons co-expressing galanin or NPY were also found. Th e presence of SP in CRF-positive submucous neurons was noted only incidentally. In the circular smooth muscle layer CRF-IR/VIP-IR, CRF-IR/NPY-IR as well as CRF-IR/SP-IR nerve fi bres were present.

40|$|Concerns {{regarding}} a drought in psychopharmacology have risen from many quarters. From one perspective, the wellspring of bedrock medications for anxiety disorders, depression, and schizophrenia was serendipitously discovered over thirty year ago, the swell of pharmaceutical investment in drug discovery has receded, and the pipeline’s flow of medications with unique mechanisms of action (i. <b>e.</b> glutamatergic agents, <b>CRF</b> antagonists) has {{slowed to a}} trickle. Might oxytocin (OT) -based therapeutics be an oasis? Though a large basic science literature and a slowly increasing number of studies in human diseases support this hope, the bulk of extant OT studies in humans are single-dose studies on normals, and do not directly relate to improvements in human brain-based diseases. Instead, these studies have left us with a field pregnant with therapeutic possibilities, but barren of definitive treatments. In this clinically-oriented review, we discuss the extant OT literature {{with an eye toward}} helping OT deliver on its promise as a therapeutic agent. To this end, we identify ten key questions that we believe future OT research should address. From this overview, several conclusions are clear: 1) the OT system represents an extremely promising target for novel CNS drug development; 2) there is a pressing need for rigorous, randomized controlled clinical trials targeting actual patients; and 3) in order to inform the design and execution of these vital trials, we need further translational studies addressing the questions posed in this review. Looking forward, we extend a cautious hope that the next decade of OT research will birth oxytocin-targetted therapeutics that can truly deliver on this system’s therapeutic potential...|$|R

Não houve interação significativa entre DL e DPI para nenhuma variável resposta. O PDESM, a ET, a variação de ET, o EC e a composição do leite (teores de gordura, proteína bruta, lactose e matéria seca) das porcas não foram influenciados (P> 0, 10) pela adição de enzimas na DL e na DPI. O <b>CRF</b> <b>e</b> o CRL não foram influenciados (P> 0, 10) pelos tratamentos. O PLDESM e o PLMDESM foram significativamente maiores quando as porcas receberam DL suplementada com CE, em comparação àquelas que não receberam CE na dieta (74, 6 vs 72, 9 kg e 6, 32 vs 6, 47 kg, respectivamente). Houve um aumento de 1, 7 kg no PLDESM e de 0, 15 kg no PLMDESM (P= 0, 06 e P= 0, 07, respectivamente), resultando em um incremento estimado de 2, 27 kg de peso vivo quando os animais chegam ao peso de abate. Porcas alimentadas com rações suplementadas com complexo enzimático contendo carboidrases apresentam leitegadas mais pesadas ao desmame. This {{research was}} conducted to evaluate {{the effect of adding}} enzymatic complex (EC) containing carbohydrases to diets for lactating sows and their litters. A total of 264 genetically homogeneous crossbred sows were used. They were blocked by farrowing order and randomly allotted to four treatments, in a 2 x 2 factorial arrangement (lactating diet (LD) x pre-starter diet (PD)), with two levels per factor (with or without EC). The following variables were measured in the sows: weaning weight; weaning weight variation; backfat; backfat variation; body condition; feed consumption and milk composition. The following variables were measured in the litter: feed consumption; post-natal weight; weaning weight; and average weaning weight. No interaction was found among LD and PD for any of the variables studied. Additionally, no effect was observed for either, female weight, backfat, body condition score or milk composition (fat content, crude protein, lactose and dry matter). Litter weaning weight and average litter weaning weight were higher when LD was supplemented with EC in comparison to the piglets from sows fed with diets without EC (74. 6 vs 72. 9 kg and 6. 32 vs 6. 47 kg, respectively). Litters from female fed with CE were 1. 7 kg heavier at weaning and showed a 0. 15 kg increase in the average weaning weight (P= 0. 06; P= 0. 07, respectively).

MÉTODOS: Foram examinados trinta e oito olhos de 19 pacientes pela manhã (9 am) e à tarde (6 pm), obtendo-se refração esfero-cilíndrica dinâmica, acuidade visual (logMAR) sem correção (AVsc) e corrigida (AVcc) e parâmetros do ORA (Ocular Response Analyzer) : histerese corneana (corneal {{hysteresis}} - CH), fator de resistência da córnea (corneal {{resistance factor}} - CRF), pressão intraocular (intraocular pressure &- IOP) calibrada para o padrão Goldmann (IOPg) e pressão compensada da córnea (IOPcc). Considerando a não distribuição normal das variáveis (teste de Kolmogorov-Smirnov), o teste de Wilcoxon signed rank foi utilizado para verificar significância nas diferenças entre as medidas da manhã e as da tarde de cada variável. O teste de Spearman foi utilizado para verificar correlações das medidas do ORA com o estado refracional e com a acuidade visual pela manhã e à tarde, assim como para verificar as correlações entre as medidas do ORA pela manhã e à tarde e as variações da refração e da acuidade visual. RESULTADOS: Grau esférico (E), equivalente esférico (EE), equivalente desfoco (ED), AVsc, IOPcc e IOPg variaram significativamente (Wilcoxon, p PURPOSE: To verify {{the morning to}} evening variations of refraction, visual acuity, intraocular pressure and biomechanical parameters on patients operated by radial keratotomy who presented for refractive re-treatments; and to correlate the biomechanical parameters with refraction, visual acuity and their variations among morning and evening. METHODS: 19 patients were examined, respectively thirty-eight eyes in the morning (9 am) and evening (6 pm), recording sphere-cylindrical dynamic refraction, visual acuity (logMAR) without correction (AVsc) and corrected (AVcc) and ORA (Ocular Response Analyzer) parameters: corneal hysteresis (CH), corneal resistance factor (CRF), intraocular pressure calibrated for Goldmann (IOPg) e corneal compensated (IOPcc). Variables had no normal distribution (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), so that the Wilcoxon signed rank was used for testing the significance on the differences for each variable between morning and afternoon. The Spearman test was used for assessing {{the correlations between the}} ORA parameters and refraction, visual acuity in the morning and afternoon, as well as to verify the correlations between the ORA parameters and the variations on refraction and visual acuity. RESULTS: Sphere (E), spherical equivalent (EE), defocus equivalent (ED), AVsc, IOPcc e IOPg varied significantly (Wilcoxon, p< 0. 05) between morning and evening. There was more hyperopia, worse visual acuity, higher pressure and lower CH in the morning measurements. In the morning measurements, there was a positive correlation (Spearman, p< 0. 05) between EE and ED and IOPcc (rs= 0. 39 and 0. 34 respectively), but not with IOPg. In the evening measurement, there were no correlations between the refractive and pressure measurements. Negative correlations were observed (Spearman, p< 0. 05) between AVsc (logMAR) and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 48 e rs= - 0, 51), between E and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 66 and - 0. 76), between <b>E</b> and <b>CRF</b> in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 40 and - 0. 47), between EE and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 70 and - 0. 68), between EE and CRF in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 41 and - 0. 46), between ED and CH in the morning and in the evening (rs= 0. 64 and - 0. 54) and between ED and CRF in the morning and in the evening (rs= - 0. 35 and - 0. 34). There was a significant negative correlation between the morning measurement of CRF and the variation of defocus equivalent (p = 0. 05; rs = - 0. 30) and the variation of AVsc (p = 0. 04; rs = - 0. 33). CONCLUSION: More hyperopia was recorded in the morning which was associated with higher compensated pressure (IOPcc) but not with IOPg ten years after RK. Lower biomechanical parameters (<b>CRF</b> <b>e</b> CH) were associated with higher hyperopia and worse visual acuity. A trend was observed for having higher fluctuation on weaker corneas.

40|$|Purpose: To compare {{visual acuity}} results, cycloplegic refraction, aberrometry and {{contrast}} sensitivity in eyes that underwent photorefractive keratectomy (PRK) with mitomycin C (MMC) or laser in situ keratomileusis (LASIK) for wavefront-guided myopic corrections during one year follow-up. To evaluate slit-lamp microscopy {{in both groups}} during follow-up. To evaluate subjective pain, visual complains and satisfaction with visual results {{in the two groups}} during follow-up. To analyse specular microscopy values before and six months after surgeries in both groups. To compare biomechanical properties of the cornea in the two groups one year after surgeries. Methods: Forty-four patients (88 eyes) with moderate myopia and an estimated ablation depth greater than 50 μm using the LADARWave 4000 (Alcon Laboratories) platform in both eyes were randomized to receive LASIK in one eye and PRK with application of MMC 0. 002 % for one minute in the fellow eye in wavefront-guided surgeries. Corneal topography (EyeSys 2000, EyeSys and Orbscan II, Orbtek/Bausch & Lomb), uncorrected visual acuity (UCVA, Early Treatment Diabetic Retinopaty Study table), cycloplegic refraction, best spectacle-corrected visual acuity (BSCVA), aberrometry (LADARWave 4000), central ultrasound corneal pachymetry (Sonogage Inc) and a comprehensive ophthalmologic examination were performed before surgeries and at one, three, six and twelve months postoperative visits. Photopic and mesopic contrast sensitivity (Optec 6500, F. A. C. T.; Stereo Optical Co) with BSCVA was performed in both eyes before surgeries and at three, six and 12 months follow-up. A subjective pain questionnaire was applied at early postoperative visits and another visual complain and satisfaction questionnaire with surgery in each eye was applied one, three, six and twelve months after surgical procedures. Slit-lamp anterior segment microscopy was performed at early postoperative visits and at follow-up visits always as the last examination (blind examiner for surgical procedure). Specular microscopy (Topcon SP 2000 p, Topcon) was performed before and six months after surgeries. Biomechanical properties of the cornea (ORA, Reichert) were evaluated one year after surgeries. The tests ANOVA for repeated measures and the student’s t test were used for statistical analyses. Results: The mean age was 31. 7 years (range, 21 - 54 years). There was no statistically significant between-group difference in UCVA, BSCVA, aberrometry, contrast sensitivity or specular microscopy before surgeries. The mean attempted spherical equivalent (SE) was - 3. 99 ± 1. 20 diopters (D) in LASIK eyes and - 3. 85 ± 1. 12 D in PRK with MMC eyes (p> 0. 05). The mean ablation depth was 73. 09 ± 14. 55 μm and 70. 70 ± 14. 07 μm in LASIK and PRK with MMC eyes, respectively (p> 0. 05). Forty-two patients (95. 5 %) completed one year follow-up. The PRK with MMC eyes presented statistically significant better mean UCVA values than LASIK eyes at three, six and 12 months visits. The mean BSCVA was also statistically significant better in PRK with MMC eyes than in LASIK eyes one year after surgeries (p 0. 05). LASIK eyes showed statistically significant higher corneal resistance factor (CRF) and corneal hysteresis (CH) values than PRK with MMC eyes (p 0, 05). A profundidade de ablação média foi de 73, 09 ± 14, 55 μm e 70, 70 ± 14, 07 μm, no grupo LASIK e no grupo PRK com MMC, respectivamente (p> 0, 05). Quarenta e dois pacientes (95, 5 %) completaram um ano de acompanhamento. Os olhos que receberam PRK com MMC apresentaram média de AVSC significativamente superior aos olhos que receberam LASIK com três, seis e doze meses de pós-operatório. A média de AVCC também foi estatisticamente superior no grupo PRK com MMC na visita de um ano de pós-operatório (p 0, 05). Na avaliação biomecânica da córnea, o grupo LASIK apresentou valores de fator de resistência corneana (<b>CRF)</b> <b>e</b> histerese (CH) significativamente superiores ao grupo PRK com MMC (p< 0, 05). Conclusões: Os olhos que receberam PRK com MMC apresentaram melhores valores de AVSC e AVCC, melhor correção de aberrações de baixa ordem e menores valores de aberrações de alta ordem em relação aos olhos que receberam LASIK. O grupo PRK com MMC também apresentou valores superiores de sensibilidade ao contraste e foi melhor avaliado em questionário subjetivo de satisfação cirúrgica. Não houve presença de haze clinicamente significativo no grupo PRK com MMC. O grupo PRK com MMC apresentou maiores índices de dor no período pósoperatório recente. Não houve diferença entre os índices de microscopia especular nos dois grupos. O grupo LASIK apresentou índices superiores de <b>CRF</b> <b>e</b> CH. TEDEBV UNIFESP: Teses e dissertaçõe...|$|R

Objetivos: Avaliar os efeitos fisiológicos imediatos da ELTGOL e do Flutter® nos volumes pulmonares dinâmicos e estáticos em pacientes com bronquiectasia e, secundariamente, determinar o efeito dessas técnicas na remoção de secreção brônquica. Métodos: Participaram do estudo pacientes com diagnóstico clínico e radiológico de bronquiectasia. Os pacientes foram submetidos a três intervenções de forma randomizada e com um intervalo (washout) de uma semana entre elas. Inicialmente os pacientes inalaram dois jatos de 100 µcg de salbutamol. Após 5 minutos de tosse iniciais e após 5 minutos de tosse que sucederam o protocolo controle e as intervenções (ELTGOL e Flutter®), os pacientes realizaram as avaliações dos volumes pulmonares dinâmicos e estáticos por meio da espirometria e pletismografia corporal. A secreção expectorada foi coletada durante as intervenções e durante a segunda série de tosse, sendo quantificada por meio de seu peso seco. Resultados: Foram avaliados dez pacientes, dois do sexo masculino e oito do sexo feminino (média de idade de 55, 9 ± 18, 1 anos).

Methods: Patients with clinical and radiological diagnosis of bronchiectasis were included. Patients underwent three interventions in a randomized order and with a one-week washout interval between them. Before all interventions patients inhaled two puffs of 100 mcg of salbutamol. There was a cough period of five minutes before and after the control protocol and the interventions (ELTGOL and Flutter VRP 1 ®). After each cough series patients underwent assessments of dynamic and static lung volumes by spirometry and plethysmography. The expectorated secretions were collected during the interventions and during the second cough series, and quantified by its dry weight. Results: We studied 10 patients, two males and eight females (mean age: 55. 9 ± 18. 1 years). After using Flutter VRP 1 ®and ELTGOL there was a significant decrease in residual volume (RV), functional residual capacity (FRC) and total lung capacity (TLC) (p< 0. 05). There was a higher sputum production during ELTGOL compared with Control and Flutter VRP 1 ® (p< 0. 05).

40|$|OBJETIVO: Verificar os resultados da cirurgia de implante de segmentos de anel estromal para ceratocone e as possíveis correlações existentes entre o resultado cirúrgico e o estado biomecânico da córnea no pré-operatório. MÉTODOS: Dezenove olhos de 19 pacientes com ceratocone foram avaliados antes e 12 meses após a cirurgia de implante de segmento anel estromal. O implante de um ou dois segmentos de anel de Ferrara foi realizado de acordo com o nomograma, considerando-se espessura da córnea, padrão topográfico da ectasia e o astigmatismo. O teste de Wilcoxon signed rank foi realizado para verificar diferenças entre a acuidade visual (logMAR) corrigida com óculos antes da cirurgia (AVccPré) e a obtida sem correção (AVscPós) e com correção (AVccPós) após a cirurgia, bem como entre os valores pré e pós-operatórios de variáveis tomográficas medidas com o Pentacam e variáveis biomecânicas da córnea medidas com o ORA (ocular {{response}} analyzer). As diferenças absolutas antes e após a cirurgia (valores delta - &# 916;) das variáveis com diferenças significantes foram calculadas. Os valores &# 916; foram correlacionados com as medidas do ORA no pré-operatório por meio dos testes de Pearson ou de Spaerman, de acordo com a distribuição das variáveis ser normal ou não (teste de Kolmogorov-Smirnov). RESULTADOS: Observou-se melhora significante na AVcc, bem como na AVscPós em comparação com a AVccPré (teste de Wilcoxon, p 0, 05).

METHODS: Nineteen eyes of 19 patients with keratoconus were evaluated before and 12 months after stromal ring segment implant surgery. The implant of one or two Ferrara ring segments was performed accordingly to the nomogram, considering corneal thickness, ectasy pattern on topography and astigmatism. The Wilcoxon test was performed to verify the differences between visual acuity (logMAR) with correction before surgery (AVccPre) and without correction (AVscPos) and with correction (AVccPos) after surgery, topography variables measured with Pentacam on pre and post operative and corneal biomechanics variables measure with ORA (ocular response analyzer). The absolute differences before and after the surgery (delta values - &# 916;) of variables with significant differences were calculated. The &# 916; values were correlated with the ORA measurements pre-operatively using Pearson or Spearman's tests, according with the distribution of the variables to be or not normal (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). RESULTS: There were significant improvements on AVcc and AVscPos comparing with AVccPre (Wilcoxon test, p 0. 05). The ORA parameters derivate form the aplanation pressure: Corneal Hysteresis (CH), Corneal Resistance Factor (CRF) and the measures of the ocular pressure (IOPg and IOPcc) showed no significant correlations with the parameters delta (&# 916;). Fifteen of the 38 biomechanical variables derived from the sign of ORA corneal reflex presented significant correlation with at least one parameter &# 916;, highlighting the correlations between &# 916;KMax with aindex e path 1 (Pearson test, p< 0. 05; r=- 0. 56 and 0. 56 respectively) and between AVccPre-AVscPos and aindex (Pearson test, p< 0. 05; r= 0. 48). The variable that had the greatest number of significant correlations was w 21, which correlated negatively with, &# 916;K 2, &# 916;K 1, &# 916;CKI and &# 916;KMax (Spearman test, p< 0. 05; r=- 0. 56; - 0. 55; - 0. 51 and - 0. 47) respectively. CONCLUSION: There is a significant improvement in visual acuity and keratometric parameters after surgery of implant the Ferrara ring segments for keratoconus. The improvement of several of these parameters with the surgery was significantly correlated with biomechanical characteristics derived from the signal of the ORA corneal reflex preoperatively. A biomechanical preoperative state "weaker" or "less resistant" was significantly related to greater clinical benefit of surgery. Analysis with multiple associations (multivariate) is necessary, including topographic parameters of the cornea and wavefront analysis of preoperative total.

40|$|O V?rus da Imunodefici?ncia Humana (HIV) ? caracterizado por uma ampla diversidade gen?tica. Dois tipos de HIV s?o reconhecidos atualmente: HIV- 1 e HIV- 2. O HIV- 1, respons?vel pela maioria dos casos de aids no mundo, ? dividido em tr?s grupos denominados M (Major), O (Outlier) e N (Non-M/Non-O). Para o grupo M, nove subtipos foram identificados at? o momento: A-D, F-H, J, K. Al?m desses subtipos, o HIV- 1 tamb?m tem sido classificado em formas recombinantes circulantes (<b>CRFs)</b> <b>e</b> formas recombinantes ?nicas (URFs). No Brasil, um complexo padr?o de distribui??o desses subtipos tem sido descrito em suas diferentes regi?es geogr?ficas. Buscando esclarecer a distribui??o dos subtipos de HIV- 1 predominantes na cidade de Manaus, este estudo teve como objetivo analisar amostras de sangue de indiv?duos candidatos a doadores de sangue que apresentaram resultados positivo ou indeterminado para HIV- 1, na triagem sistem?tica para doa??o de sangue da Funda??o de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM). Na ocasi?o da coleta, os doadores registraram a sua autoriza??o atrav?s da assinatura do termo de consentimento livre e esclarecido e responderam a um question?rio utilizado para investiga??o de dados epidemiol?gicos. O DNA proviral extra?do das amostras com resultados indeterminado/positivo no Wersten Blot foi submetido a uma Rea??o em Cadeia da Polimerase em duas etapas (Nested PCR) para a confirma??o da infec??o pelo HIV- 1. Os produtos amplificados (regi?es gag, pol e env) das 31 amostras reativas por PCR foram seq?enciados e analisados por m?todos filogen?ticos usando o programa Phylip. Todas as amostras indeterminadas para o teste confirmat?rio apresentaram padr?o de amplifica??o negativo. Das amostras reativas para HIV-I no teste confirmat?rio e PCR, observou-se predomin?ncia do sexo masculino (77, 4 %) e de doadores de primeira vez (67, 7 %). Entre os doadores de repeti??o, 60 % apresentaram soroconvers?o em at? 20 meses. Do total de amostras, identificou-se a predomin?ncia do subtipo B (87, 1 %), seguida do subtipo C (6, 5 %), F (3, 2 %) e recombinante BF (3, 2 %). As seq??ncias de amino?cidos de 19 isolados foram analisadas para a caracteriza??o da variabilidade gen?tica da regi?o da al?a V 3. Dentre os isolados do subtipo B, o tetrapept?deo mais prevalente foi o GPGR (68, 4 %), seguido pelo variante brasileiro B GWGR (15, 8 %). A ocorr?ncia do Subtipo C na regi?o Norte, ainda n?o foi relatada na literatura. As an?lises de similaridade dos isolados do subtipo C nesse estudo demonstraram maior semelhan?a destes com outros isolados brasileiros, em rela??o a isolados de outras partes do mundo. Nossos resultados contribuem para uma melhor compreens?o das caracter?sticas dos isolados do HIV- 1 circulantes no Brasil, informa??es que poder?o ser utilizados em benef?cio do diagn?stico, tratamento, controle da doen?a e prepara??o de vacinas. The Human Immunodeficiency Virus (HIV) is {{characterized}} by a wide genetic diversity. Two types of HIV are recognized at present: HIV- 1 and HIV- 2. The HIV- 1, responsible for most of the cases of AIDS in the world, is divided in three groups denominated M (Major), O (Outlier) and N (Non-M/Non-O), and until this moment nine subtypes of the group M (A-D, F-H, J-K) were already identified. Beyond of those subtypes, the HIV- 1 also have been classified in circulating recombinant forms (CRFs) and unique recombinant forms (URFs). In Brazil, a pattern complex of distribution of those subtypes has been described in their different geographical areas. In search of elucidating the predominant subtypes of HIV- 1 in the city of Manaus, this study had as objective to analyze blood samples of subjects that presented results positive or indeterminate for HIV, in the systematic selection of blood donors of the Funda??o de Hematologia e Hemoterapia do Amazonas (HEMOAM). In the moment of the collect, the donors registered their authorization by the signature of the free consent and knowledge term and they answered a questionnaire used for epidemic data investigation. DNA proviral extracted of the samples with indeterminate/positive resulted in Western Blot was submitted a Polimerase Chain Reaction in two stages (Nested PCR) for the confirmation of the HIV-I infection. The amplified products (regions gag, pol and env) of the 31 samples reactivate for PCR were automatically sequencing and analyzed phylogenetically by the Phylip program. All of the indeterminate samples for the confirmatory test presented negative amplification pattern. Of the reactivates samples for HIV in the confirmatory test and PCR, it was observed male predominance (77, 4 %) and in the donors of first time (67, 7 %). Among the repetition donors, 60 % presented seroconvertion in up to 20 months. Of the total of samples, was identified the predominance of the subtype B (87, 1 %), following by the subtype C (6, 5 %), F (3, 2 %) and recombinant BF (3, 2 %). The amino acids sequences of 19 isolated were analyzed for the genetic variability characterization of the region of the loop V 3. Among the isolated of the subtype B, the tetrapeptide more prevalente was GPGR (68, 4 %), following by the Brazilian variant B" GWGR (15, 8 %). The Subtype C occurrence in the North Region still was not reported in the literature. The analyses of similarity of the isolated of the subtype C in this study demonstrated larger similarity of these with other isolated ones brazilian, in relation to isolated {{in other parts of the}} world. Our results can contribute to a better understanding of the characteristics of the lineages of the HIV- 1 circulating in Brazil, information that can be used in benefit of the diagnosis, treatment, control of the disease and preparation of vaccines...|$|R
40|$|O presente estudo foi realizado com o objetivo analisar o autocontrole de crianças a partir da variação simultânea da {{magnitude}} e do atraso do reforço, com e sem a possibilidade de realização de atividades distrativas durante o período de atraso do reforço. Os participantes, 11 crianças com idade de 5 a 11 anos, com e sem o diagnóstico de TDAH, foram submetidas a esquema concorrente-encadeado num computador. A conseqüência produzida pela resposta no primeiro elo, dava início ao segundo elo e uma nova resposta, sobre o mesmo componente selecionado anteriormente, produzia, em VI 15 s, uma nova conseqüência e o início do o período de atraso do reforço (FT) com ou sem as atividades distrativas. O terceiro elo tinha início logo após o fim do período de atraso. Os participantes foram submetidos a duas condições de linha de base, uma para avaliar o controle que a dimensão magnitude do reforço exercia sobre o responder, a outra para avaliar o controle da dimensão atraso do reforço. Na condição experimental, houve a variação simultânea da magnitude e do atraso do reforço com ou sem a possibilidade de realização de atividades distrativas durante o período de atraso. Esta variação envolveu quatro fases, em um dos componentes o período de atraso e magnitude do reforço permaneceu constante (10 s e 1 ficha); e no outro componente, ambos foram aumentados progressivamente(30 s e 5 fichas, Fase 1; 60 s e 10 fichas, Fase 2; 1 min e 30 s, Fase 3; e 2 min, Fase 4). Em seguida, os participantes foram submetidos a uma nova condição, semelhante à anterior, porém sem as atividades distrativas. Tal condição tinha início a partir da Fase 4. Caso a criança alcançasse o critério para encerramento da fase (responder em dez tentativas consecutivas sobre o um mesmo componente), o programa era finalizado; caso contrário, a criança voltaria para uma fase anterior, e assim sucessivamente. Em todas as condições ao final do período de atraso, entrava em vigor o período de acesso ao reforço. Fichas, representadas por traços verdes na tela do computador, foram utilizadas como reforço. As fichas eram ganhas num esquema <b>CRF,</b> <b>e</b> trocadas por brinquedos no final da sessão. Os participantes hierarquizavam os objetos, considerados como potenciais reforçadores, no início de cada sessão. O valor máximo era de 250 fichas e, progressivamente, de 10 em 10, esse valor ia diminuindo até chegar ao número mínimo de 10 fichas. A hipótese era que tais valores pudessem indicar o valor reforçador de cada objeto, de maneira que o reforço de maior valor tivesse o maior preço (250 fichas) e o reforço de menor valor tivesse o preço mais baixo (10 fichas). Ao final de cada sessão, o participante conferia o número de fichas obtidas na tela do computador e as trocava pelos itens que podia comprar, conforme o valor estipulado, pelo próprio participante. Os resultados encontrados revelam que, na fase de linha de base de magnitude, as crianças, na maioria das tentativas, responderam no componente que produzia magnitude alta, mas na linha de base atraso, a maioria respondeu no componente que produzia maior atraso do reforço. Quando houve manipulação simultânea dessas variáveis, os participantes responderam mais freqüentemente no componente que produzia maior magnitude e do atraso do reforço, mesmo com o aumento progressivo do atraso através das fases, chegando até 2 min. Os resultados são discutidos em termos do número de respostas emitidas, na presença e na ausência de tais atividades, e de seu possível valor reforçadorThe {{present study}} was aimed at analyzing child self-control through the simultaneous variation of magnitude and delay of reinforcement, with and {{without the possibility of}} engaging in a distracting activity during the delay of reinforcement. The participants, 11 {{children between the ages of}} five to eleven, with and without a diagnosis of ADHD, were presented with a computer task in a concurrent-chain schedule. The consequence produced by the response in the first link initiated the second link, and a new response, on the same component selected previously, produced, in VI 15 s, a new consequence and the beginning of the period of delay of reinforcement (FT) with or without the distracting activities. The third link begun right after the end of the period of delay. The participants were submitted to two baseline conditions: one to evaluate the control that the magnitude of reinforcement dimension exerted over the response; and another to evaluate the control exerted by the delay of reinforcement dimension. In the experimental condition, there was simultaneous variation of magnitude and delay of reinforcement, with or without the possibility of engaging in distracting activities during the delay of reinforcement period. This variation involved four phases: in one of the components the magnitude and delay of reinforcement period remained constant (10 s and 1 token); and in the other component, both were gradually increased (30 s and 5 tokens, Phase 1; 60 s and 10 tokens, Phase 2; 1 min 30 s and 15 tokens, Phase 3; e 2 min and 20 tokens, Phase 4). After that, the participants were submitted to a new condition, similar to the previous one, but without the distracting activities. Such condition was introduced from Phase 4. If the child reached the ending criterion for the phase (answering in ten consecutive attempts on one same component), the program was ended; if not, the child would go back to a previous phase, and thus successively. In all conditions, at the end of the period of delay, the period of access to reinforcement became effective. Tokens, represented by green traces on the computer screen, were used as reinforcers. Tokens were earned on a CRF schedule, and exchanged for toys at the end of the session. At the beginning of each session, participants established a specific value to each of the objects used as potential reinforcers. The maximum value was of 250 tokens and, gradually, by 10 s, this value diminished till a minimum of 10 tokens. The hypothesis was that such values could indicate the potential reinforcing value of each object, so that the most valued reinforcer had the highest price (250 tokens) and the least valued reinforcer had the lowest price (10 tokens). At the end of each session, the participant checked the number of tokens he got, on the computer screen, and exchanged them for items he could buy, according to the value the participant himself had stipulated. The results showed that, in the phase of magnitude baseline, in the majority of the attempts, the children answered on the component that produced high magnitude, but in the delay baseline, the majority answered on the component that produced greater delay of reinforcement. When there was simultaneous manipulation of those variables, the participants answered more frequently on the component that produced higher reinforcement magnitude, in spite of greater delay of reinforcement, even with the gradual increase of the delay through the phases, up to 2 min. Results are discussed in relation to the number of responses emitted, in the presence and in the absence of such activities, and their possible reinforcing valu...|$|R
