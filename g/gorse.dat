5|$|North Trafford: Cornbrook, Davyhulme, Firswood, Flixton, <b>Gorse</b> Hill, Lostock, Old Trafford, Stretford, Trafford Park and Urmston.|$|E
5|$|The {{headland}} {{is primarily}} covered with grass, {{as well as}} heather (Calluna vulgaris), bracken (Pteridium aquilinum), thyme (Thymus polytrichus) and western <b>gorse</b> (Ulex gallii). In 1962, specimens of the comparatively rare western clover (Trifolium occidentale) were found on Zennor Head. The lichen Dirina massiliensis has also been found high on the acid schist cliffs on the north-, seaward-side of the headland. The parasitic plant dodder (Cuscuta epithymum) is found growing on <b>gorse.</b> There are also typical coastal flowering plants such as kidney vetch (Anthyllis vulneraria), sea campion (Silene uniflora), and thrift (Armeria maritima).|$|E
5|$|As a {{consequence}} of the Local Government Act 1972, the borough of Stretford was abolished and Trafford Park has, since 1 April 1974, formed part of the Metropolitan Borough of Trafford. As of 2010, the park is in the Trafford ward of <b>Gorse</b> Hill.|$|E
50|$|<b>Gorses</b> is a commune in the Lot {{department}} in south-western France.|$|R
50|$|The Lac de Tolerme {{is located}} between {{the communes of}} <b>Gorses</b> and Sénaillac-Latronquière.|$|R
50|$|The {{caterpillars}} feed on brooms, namely {{of the genera}} Cytisus, Genista, Laburnum (golden chains) and Ulex (<b>gorses).</b>|$|R
5|$|In June 2004, Trafford {{adopted a}} revised set of ward boundaries, and the ward of Talbot was {{replaced}} by the new ward of <b>Gorse</b> Hill. Re-aligning the 2001 census figures with the 2004 ward boundaries gives Stretford a population of 42,121.|$|E
5|$|The Moss {{contains}} several {{varieties of}} heather, {{as well as}} the purple moor grass Molinia caerulea. Ferns and <b>gorse</b> are common too, and in areas where peat has been cut in the past, there are bog mosses, the bog bean Menyanthus trifoliata, and marsh pennywort.|$|E
5|$|On {{the hill}} summits {{that dot the}} {{headlands}} are heather and <b>gorse,</b> shaped by the prevailing wind; thrift and wild thyme thrive on the acidic soil. The cliffs are a stronghold of the chough, and a nesting place for razorbills and guillemots. On the lower rocks, in reach of the waves, are plentiful lichens, seaweeds, sponges, limpets and barnacles.|$|E
50|$|Heathland {{succession}} {{moves from}} grasses and bracken to <b>gorses</b> and heather, {{and finally to}} woodland (birch, pine and oaks).|$|R
6000|$|... "We'll {{draw the}} small <b>gorses</b> first," [...] {{said the old}} master, {{addressing}} himself specially to Mr. Newton, [...] "and then we'll go into Barford Wood." ...|$|R
60|$|Without further ado I {{handed him}} Mr. <b>Gorse's</b> letter, and another Mr. Watling {{had given me}} for him, which {{contained}} {{a copy of the}} bill. He read these, laid them on the table, glancing at me again, stroking his goatee the while. He chuckled.|$|R
5|$|Stretford Cenotaph, {{opposite}} the Chester Road entrance to <b>Gorse</b> Hill Park, was {{built as a}} memorial to the 580 Stretford men {{who lost their lives}} in the First World War. Their names and regiments are listed on a large bronze plaque on the wall behind the cenotaph. It was formally unveiled in 1923, by the Earl of Derby, Secretary of State for War.|$|E
5|$|Stretford {{comprises}} the local areas of Old Trafford, <b>Gorse</b> Hill, Trafford Park and Firswood. Its climate is generally temperate, with few extremes of temperature or weather. The mean temperature is slightly above {{average for the}} United Kingdom. Annual rainfall and average amount of sunshine are both slightly below the average for the UK.|$|E
5|$|The hilltops {{are covered}} in {{heathland}} of <b>gorse,</b> heather, bracken and thorn with plantations of conifer. The {{western side of the}} Quantocks are steep scarp slopes of pasture, woods and parkland. Deep stream-cut combes to the north-east contain extensive oak-woods with small flower-rich bogs above them. The areas where there is limited drainage are dominated by heather (Calluna vulgaris), with significant populations of cross-leaved heath (Erica tetralix), purple moor-grass (Molinia caerulea), bilberry (Vaccinium myrtillus) and wavy hair-grass (Deschampsia flexuosa). Drier areas are covered with bell heather (Erica cinerea), western <b>gorse</b> (Ulex gallii) and bristle bent (Agrostis curtisii), while bracken (Pteridium aquilinum) is common on well-drained deeper soils. The springs and streams provide a specialist environment that supports bog pimpernel (Anagallis tenella). The woodland is generally birch/sessile oak woodland, valley alder woodland and ash/wych elm woodland, which support a rich lichen flora. Alfoxton Wood is one of only three British locations where the lichen Tomasellia lectea is present.|$|E
6000|$|... "All right," [...] {{said the}} judge, who knew an order {{when he heard}} one, [...] "I guess we can find an error." [...] He was not a little frightened by the report of Mr. <b>Gorse's</b> wrath, for election-day was approaching. [...] "Say, you wouldn't take me for a sentimental man, now, would you?" ...|$|R
60|$|In {{spite of}} the {{intimacy}} which I knew existed between them, in my presence at least Mr. <b>Gorse's</b> manner was little different with Mr. Watling than it was with other men. Mr. Wading {{did not seem to}} mind. He pulled up a chair close to the desk and began, without any preliminaries, to explain his errand.|$|R
5000|$|In {{the north}} and west walls, at first-floor level, are five embrasures, with {{circular}} gunports, to these elevation also are stone corbels in groups of three, these supported a sectional projecting stone parapet. Outside the south gateway are the remains of stone footings. There are no longer any trace remains of the [...] "steppes of stone" [...] that were referred to in <b>Gorse's</b> Antiquities and Coker's Dorset; the steps connected the castle and the old church of St. Andrew.|$|R
5|$|Trafford Park {{contained}} the hall, its grounds, and three farms: Park Farm, Moss Farm, and Waters Meeting Farm. From the original three entrance lodges to the park, at Throstle Nest, Barton-upon-Irwell and Old Trafford, only {{the latter has}} survived, having been relocated from its original position opposite what is today the White City retail park to become the entrance to <b>Gorse</b> Hill Park.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} Manchester United players, {{including}} {{some of those who}} lost their lives in the Munich air disaster of February 1958, lived in lodgings at 19 <b>Gorse</b> Avenue. A blue plaque was unveiled at the house by former lodger and Munich survivor Sir Bobby Charlton in recognition of the house's association with Manchester United. The owner of the house during the 1950s was Margaret Watson, although {{by the time of the}} plaque's unveiling more than 50 years later it was occupied by a different family.|$|E
5|$|Among scarce plants {{found on}} Sand Point are smallflower buttercup, and honewort. The range of soils {{at the site}} support various flora and fauna. The {{calcareous}} grassland is dominated by Festuca species and Dactylis glomerata, while the scrub towards {{the west of the}} site is dominated by hawthorn (Crataegus monogyna) and blackthorn (Prunus spinosa), while that to the east consists of common <b>gorse</b> (Ulex europaeus) and bramble (Rubus fruticosus agg). Less common plants include the cheddar pink (Dianthus gratianopolitanus) and Somerset hair grass (Koeleria vallesiana).|$|E
5000|$|In the 1920s {{there was}} a growing {{interest}} in native pony breeds {{and there was no}} stronger devotee than Allen W. Seaby, Professor of Fine Art at Reading University, who wrote a series of books on the main breeds, starting with Skewbald: The New Forest Pony (1923), illustrated with his own woodcuts and water colours. These nature books paved the way for scores of minor Black Beautys, the best of which was Golden <b>Gorse’s</b> Moorland Mousie (1929), illustrated by the great sporting artist Lionel Edwards.|$|R
60|$|I {{have never}} {{realized}} {{more strongly than}} in that moment the psychological force of prestige. Little by little, for five years, {{an estimate of the}} extent of Miller <b>Gorse's</b> power had been coming home to me, and his features stood in my mind for his particular kind of power. He was a tremendous worker, and often remained in his office until ten and eleven at night. He dismissed the stenographer by the wave of a hand which seemed to thrust her bodily out of the room.|$|R
40|$|European Union Directive 96 / 23 of the 29 th April 1996 {{requires}} {{member states}} to monitor certain substances and residues thereof in live animals and animal products in EU member countries. The Department of Agriculture, Food and Rural Development co-ordinate the programme in Ireland. This programme involves many food groups such as bovine, pigs, sheep, goats, <b>gorses,</b> poultry, aquaculture, milk, eggs, rabbit, game and honey. The Marine Institute through the Department of Marine and Natural Resources is charged with the responsibility of monitoring farmed finfish in the Republic of Ireland. Funder: Marine Institut...|$|R
5|$|At {{the time}} of his death Edwards was living in lodgings in <b>Gorse</b> Avenue, Stretford. He was engaged to be married to Molly Leech, who was 22 years old and worked in the offices of a textile machine {{manufacturer}} in Altrincham. The couple met at a function at a hotel at Manchester Airport, dated for a year before becoming engaged, and were godparents to the daughter of Leech's friend Josephine Stott.|$|E
5|$|To {{the south}} are Dinas Bach and Dinas Mawr, twin peninsulas formed from {{weathered}} pillow lavas 600million years old, {{thought to have been}} early fortified sites from the Iron Age. Kittiwakes, cormorants and shags can be seen on the cliffs, while farm birds such as the yellowhammer frequent the <b>gorse.</b> On Mynydd Anelog, experimental plots have been marked out to monitor different methods of managing heather to discover the best way the habitat can be conserved for the future.|$|E
5|$|Invasive weeds are {{prevalent}} in, {{and damaging}} to, the park. Species common in other formerly occupied {{parts of the}} foothills are also common in the park. Of significant concern, largely for their impact on native flora, are bridal creeper (Asparagus asparagoides), boneseed (Chrysanthemoides monilifera), artichoke thistle (Cynara cardunculus), varieties of broom, Spanish heath (Erica lusitanica), fennel (Foeniculum vulgare), olives, blackberries, common <b>gorse</b> (Ulex europaeus) and dog rose (Rosa canina). In July 2001, Phytophthora cinnamomi, a significant cause of plant disease in the Adelaide Hills, {{was found in the}} park. Mechanical countermeasures, in the form of boot scrubbing stations, have been introduced to control its spread.|$|E
50|$|Lowland Heath is a Biodiversity Action Plan habitat {{as it is}} a type {{of ancient}} wild landscape. Natural England's Environmental Stewardship scheme {{describes}} lowland heath as containing dry heath, wet heath and valley mire communities, usually below 250 metres in altitude, on acidic soils and shallow peat, typically comprising heathers, <b>gorses,</b> fine grasses, wild flowers and lichens in a complex mosaic. Heathers and other dwarf shrubs usually account for at least 25% of the ground cover. By contrast, upland heath, which is above 300 metres in altitude, is called Moorland, Dartmoor being an example.|$|R
5000|$|Pony books {{themselves}} {{began to}} appear in the late 1920s. In 1928 British lifestyle magazine Country Life published Golden <b>Gorse's</b> The Young Rider which went to a second edition in 1931, and a third in 1935. In the preface to the third edition, the author wrote: [...] "Since then the outlook on children and their ponies has changed very much for the better." [...] She also noted an increase in equestrian pastimes: [...] "Five children seem to be learning to ride today for one who was learning seven years ago." ...|$|R
50|$|The forest {{supports}} a rich invertebrate fauna, with many heathland specialities. Half of Britain's 46 breeding species of damselflies and dragonflies (the Odonata) have been recorded, the scarcer among them being the black darter, brilliant emerald and small red damselfly. It {{is also an}} important home for the golden-ringed dragonfly, which flies from mid-June to early September. Of the forest's 34 species of butterfly, the most spectacular, the purple emperor, can be hard to see. Another speciality, the silver-studded blue, is by contrast plentiful, with the main food plants of its caterpillars being <b>gorses</b> and heathers.|$|R
5|$|Stretford {{is one of}} {{the four}} major urban areas in Trafford; the other three are Altrincham, Sale and Urmston. The area {{historically}} known as Stretford, between the River Irwell in the north and the River Mersey in the south, has since 2004 been divided between the Trafford local government wards of Clifford, Longford, <b>Gorse</b> Hill, and Stretford. Each ward is represented by three local councillors, giving Stretford 12 of the 63 seats on Trafford Council. The wards elect in thirds on a four yearly cycle. As of the 2014 local elections, all 12 of the councillors representing the Stretford area are members of the Labour Party.|$|E
5|$|The Chetco River {{watershed}} {{is covered}} primarily by temperate coniferous forest, which includes {{species such as}} Douglas fir, western hemlock, white fir, Port Orford cedar, California incense cedar, and Sitka spruce. Jeffrey pine, knobcone pine, and golden chinquapin have also been identified. Hardwoods including tanoak, bigleaf maple, red alder, and Pacific madrone are common. Manzanita, hazelnut, vine maple, western skunk cabbage, and multiple species of berries and grasses make up the understory. Kalmiopsis, a flowering evergreen shrub and the namesake of the Kalmiopsis Wilderness, only grows in the Siskiyou Mountains. Several noxious weeds have also been identified, including <b>gorse,</b> Scotch broom, blackberries, and thistles.|$|E
5|$|The hill is {{blanketed}} in heather, {{which gives}} it a deep purple colour during the summer. Ling and bell heather, <b>gorse,</b> sessile oak, ash, rowan, hazel, bracken, mosses, liverworts, lichens and ferns all grow on the hill or in surrounding woodland, {{as well as some}} unique whitebeam species. Exmoor ponies, red deer, pied flycatchers, wood warblers, lesser spotted woodpeckers, redstarts, dippers, snipe, skylarks and kestrels are some of the fauna to be found on or around the hill and in nearby Horner Woods, home to 14 of the 16 UK bat species and including barbastelle and Bechstein's bats.|$|E
6000|$|Here was a doctrine, I {{immediately}} perceived, {{which it}} would be suicidal to attempt to refute. It ought, indeed, to have been my line. With a growing distaste I {{began to realize that}} all there was left for me was to flatter a populace that Krebs, paradoxically, belaboured. Never in the history of American [...] "uplift" [...] had an electorate been in this manner wooed! upbraided for expediency, a proneness to demand immediate results, an unwillingness to think, yes, and an inability to think straight. Such an electorate deserved to be led around by the nose by the Jasons and Dickinsons, the <b>Gorses</b> and the Griersons and the Parets.|$|R
50|$|The {{village has}} a church, a primary school, a newsagent, a general store and four public houses, the Lever Bridge Inn, the Volunteer (formerly the Artillery & Volunteer), the Farmer's Arms and the Lever's Arms. The village also {{features}} two cricket pitches and borders both Moses Gate Country Park and Leverhulme Park. Darcy Lever {{also has the}} steepest public highway in Bolton, <b>Gorses</b> Steps. Through the village and park run {{the remains of the}} Manchester Bolton and Bury Canal and the Bolton-Bury/Radcliffe railway line, which had a station which was open between 1848 and 1951. The history and development of Darcy Lever as with its neighbour Little Lever is linked to three families, the Levers, the Cromptons and the Fletchers.|$|R
50|$|While {{repairing}} {{a magical}} net protecting Winding Circle with Dedicate Frostpine and his apprentice Kirel, Daja sees a magically hidden boat {{out of the}} corner of her eye. While eating a turnover from Dedicate <b>Gorse's</b> kitchen's, Briar smells the unmistakable scent of cinnamon and poppy, a sure sign of someone invisible. A forgetful novice realizes that there are a lack of bandages, so Dedicate Lark and Sandry are forced to make some more. The Temple is short on medicine, so Dedicate Rosethorn and Briar are forced to make more. All the signs lead to trouble. When Daja finally tells Frostpine about the ship, he immediately tells Dedicate Superior Moonstream, who sends word to Duke Vedris IV, Sandry's uncle and the ruler of Emelan. Pirates are afoot.|$|R
