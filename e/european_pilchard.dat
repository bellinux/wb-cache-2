In particular, 2 food web models for the 1950 s and 2000 s were built to investigate: (1) the main structural and functional characteristics of the Mediterranean food web during these 2 time periods; (2) the key species/functional groups and interactions; (3) the role of fisheries and their impact; and (4) the ecosystem properties of the Mediterranean Sea in comparison with other European regional seas. Our results show that small pelagic fishes, mainly <b>European</b> <b>pilchards</b> and anchovies, prevailed in terms of biomasses and catches during both periods. Large pelagic fishes, sharks and medium pelagic fishes {{played a key role}} in the 1950 s ecosystem, and have been replaced in more recent years by benthopelagic and benthic cephalopods. Fisheries showed large effects on most living groups of the ecosystem in both time periods. When comparing the Mediterranean results to those of other European regional seas modelling initiatives, the Mediterranean stood alone in relation to the type of flows (e. g. Mediterranean Sea, flow to detritus: 42 %; other EU seas, consumption: 43 - 48 %) driving the system and the cycling indices. This suggested higher levels of community stress induced by intensive fishing activities in the Mediterranean basin.

50|$|The Short-beaked garfish (Belone svetovidovi) is an {{uncommon}} species of needlefish {{in marine waters}} of the Eastern Atlantic ocean. It is a pelagic needlefish that is present in Ireland, Spain, Portugal, and the United Kingdom. It is possible Belone svetovidovi is thriving in the Mediterranean Sea as well. This species {{was thought to be}} the same as the Garfish (Belone belone) because they share the same waters. Belone svetovidovi matures at 30 cm (12 in) and can grow to a maximum of 65 cm (26 in) while Belone belone can be 95 cm (38 in). Like all needlefish, this one has an elongated body with beak-like jaws that are lined with razor sharp teeth. The Short-beaked garfishs' lower jaw is longer than the upper. Its body is silvery like most needlefish and has a black stripe running across its lateral line. The dorsal and anal fins are very close to the caudal peduncle. These fish are Oviparous. Eggs may be found attached to objects in the water by tendrils on the egg's surface. They are spherical eggs that are dispersed on the sea floor (demersal). There is not much known about this fish's feeding habits, or anything about this fish for that matter. It is likely it preys on small ocean going fish. It has been caught using mackerel before. Needlefish tend to be towards the surface so fish such as Atlantic Mackerel, <b>European</b> <b>pilchard,</b> Sand smelt etc. would be preyed on. The Short-beaked garfish is likely distributed in these countries: Algeria, Cyprus, Israel, Lebanon, Turkey, Greece, Ireland, Italy, Portugal, Spain, and the United Kingdom.|$|E

Factors examined were diet composition, prey importance, season, fish size, feeding strategy and prey orientation in the oesophagus. The stomach contents of 308 specimens were collected and analyzed between March and November 2000. Synodus saurus is common in Azorean water. Though it prefers small gregarious pelagic fish, it also feeds on epibenthic and benthic prey. We found the following prey in its diet: 9 families of teleostean fishes (Carangidae, clupeidae, Cynoglossidae, Gobiidae, Labridae, Myctophidae, Spaidae, Spyraenidae and Synodontidae), two families of crustaceans (Cymothoidae and Scyllaridae) and one of cephalopods (Loliginidae).

Input datawere based on several recurrent scientific surveys, two alternative datasets for fishing data, stock assessment outputs, stomach content analyses and published information. Results showed that the functional groups were organised into five trophic levels with the highest one represented by dolphins, anglerfish, Atlantic bluefin tuna, European hake and European conger. <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> and European anchovy dominated in terms of fish biomass and catch.

Here, we combined stomach content analyses (SCA) and stable isotope analyses (SIA) to describe bottlenose dolphins diet in the Gulf of Cadiz (North Atlantic Ocean). Prey items identified using SCA included European conger (Conger conger) and European hake (Merluccius merluccius) as the most important ingested prey. However, mass-balance isotopic mixing model (MixSIAR), using δ 13 C and δ 15 N, indicated that the assimilated diet consisted mainly on Sparidae species (e. g. seabream, Diplodus annularis and D. bellottii, rubberlip grunt, Plectorhinchus mediterraneus, and common pandora, Pagellus erythrinus) and a mixture of other species including European hake, mackerels (Scomber colias, S. japonicus and S. scombrus), European conger, red bandfish (Cepola macrophthalma) and <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> (Sardina pilchardus).

Species were selected due to their habitat, trophic level, feeding behaviour and their use in the Italian diet. Mussels, filter feeder and sedentary organisms, were used {{in order to test}} water pollution whereas Norway lobster and red mullet (benthic fish) were used in order to test sediment pollution. The concentration of ?PCBs exceeded that of ?OCs in the samples analysed. The highest concentrations of ?PCBs (1415 ng/g lipid weight) and ?OCs (507 ng/g lipid weight) were found in pilchard while the lowest concentrations of the same pollutants were found in cephalopods. Our results have shown that species such as anchovy, pilchard and mackerel, were the most polluted due to their location at the last level of the trophic chain.

This is greatly impacting global biodiversity, economy and human health. Intriguingly, marine fish are largely surveyed using selective and invasive methods, which are mostly limited to commercial species, and restricted to particular areas with favourable conditions. Furthermore, misidentification of species represents a major problem. Here, we investigate {{the potential of}} using metabarcoding of environmental DNA (eDNA) obtained directly from seawater samples to account for marine fish biodiversity. This eDNA approach has recently been used successfully in freshwater environments, but never in marine settings. We isolate eDNA from ½-litre seawater samples collected in a temperate marine ecosystem in Denmark. Using next-generation DNA sequencing of PCR amplicons, we obtain eDNA from 15 different fish species, including both important consumption species, as well as species rarely or never recorded by conventional monitoring.

Finally, in order to examine the potential dispersal of eDNA in oceans, we performed an experiment addressing eDNA degradation in seawater, which shows that even small (100 -bp) eDNA fragments degrades beyond detectability within days.

[...] 1 pageKnowing {{the feeding}} habits of marine predators is {{essential}} to understand their ecological role in the ecosystem. Moreover, this information is pivotal for an accurate management and conservation strategies of their populations. The Atlantic bonito Sarda sarda is an epipelagic Scombrid distributed throughout the Atlantic Ocean, Mediterranean and Black Seas. This migratory predator represents an important ﬁshery resource along its range of distribution, {{as well as in}} the NW Mediterranean. However, despite its commercial and ecological importance, accurate information of its trophic habits in the Mediterranean is very scarce. In this study, our main aim is to examine the feeding ecology (diet composition and trophic level) of the Atlantic bonito in the NW Mediterranean Sea by combining stable isotopic and stomach content methodologies at different temporal scales. Also we compare the trophic habits of the Atlantic bonito with information from several species of the same ecosystem to determine its ecological role. Our stable isotopic and stomach content results reveal a clearly importance of small pelagic ﬁsh in the diet of this top predator without seasonal changes in diet during the year. In particular, the diet of the Atlantic bonito includes the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus as the main prey in its diet. Other pelagic species found in its diet are the <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> Sardina pilchardus and the round sardinella Sardinella aurita.

In particular, condition indices (morphometric, bioenergetic and biochemical) have never been compared and validated for the European anchovy Engraulis encrasicolus, the <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> Sardina pilchardus and the European sprat Sprattus sprattus. The accuracy of two indirect methods, the morphometric relative condition index Kn and the bioenergetics index determined with the Distell Fish Fatmeter was investigated by comparing with a direct measure of relative lipid content carried out with a thin layer chromatography-flame ionization detector. Estimations from the fatmeter correlated quite well with the relative lipid contents of all species, regardless of the reproductive period (R 2 = 0. 69 for anchovy, R 2 = 0. 75 for sprat and R 2 = 0. 48 for sardine). Kn correlated more poorly with relative lipid content (R 2 = 0. 22 for anchovy and R 2 = 0. 41 for sardine, ns for sprat), especially during the reproductive period, pointing out the difficulty for such an index to precisely reflect changes in fat allocation. During the reproductive period, changes in Kn could reflect other processes, such as changes in protein content. Therefore, these different types of commonly used indices do not reflect exactly {{the same type of}} energy stores. The high repeatability of the fatmeter was brought to light, so that only one measurement on each fish side may be necessary to evaluate the relative lipid content of a small pelagic fish. Finally, fatmeter measurements were not affected by freezing storage up to one month for anchovy (R 2 = 0. 66) and sardine (R 2 = 0. 90), making it possible to use frozen samples of both commercial and scientific survey. In contrast, the freezing storage for sprat should be avoided. Based on this study, the Fatmeter appears to be a suitable indirect method to assess condition and fat content of sardine and anchovy on a large number of individuals...|$|E

Based on the datasets that emerged from the literature review, there is no information on any biological characteristic for 43 % (n = 310) of the Mediterranean fish species, whereas for an additional 15 % (n = 109) of them there is information about just one characteristic. The gap between current and desired knowledge (defined here as having information on most biological characteristics for at least half of the Mediterranean marine fishes) is smaller in length-weight relationships, which have been studied for 43 % of the species, followed by spawning (39 %), diet (29 %), growth (25 %), maturity (24 %), lifespan (19 %) and fecundity (17 %). The gap is larger in natural mortality for which information is very scarce (8 %).

Two different methodologies for analysing stomach contents were used to describe the trophic dynamics of sardine and the relationship of sardine feeding behaviour with the ontogenetic development of body structures used for feeding, such as gill rakers and pyloric caeca. This information is essential to accurately depict the use of the planktonic resources in the area by sardine and to discuss {{the extent to which the}} sardine population could be affected by environmental changes in the Mediterranean Sea. We showed that cladocerans in summer and diatoms in winter were numerically the most important prey types for both juveniles and adults. However, decapod larvae were the most important prey during all seasons in terms of carbon content. Accordingly, differences in methodology should be considered in the analysis of sardine diets. An analysis of the composition of the plankton showed that small copepods were strongly selected by sardines at all ages and in both seasons. We also observed that the pyloric caeca began to grow when the sardines were approximately 4 - 5 cm standard length (SL) and ended their development when the sardines reached approximately 8 cm SL, whereas the gill rakers appeared to be completely functional when the sardines reached 7 cm SL. Therefore, filter feeding of small particles could be performed with total efficacy beginning at 7 - 8 cm SL. In view of the energetic advantage of filter feeding in a well-adapted filter-feeding species such as sardine, the prospective limited availability of small particles hypothesized by certain authors for the Mediterranean could have negative consequences for sardine. This study demonstrates that sardine populations, given their extremely high dependence on the lower marine trophic levels, could be strongly affected by alterations in the environment and in the planktonic community...|$|E

The differential capability of the Niven agar was found to be low and approximately one fifth of the suspect colonies were confirmed by the PCR test, which however included both strong and weak histamine producing strains. The presence of Morganella morganii was associated with concentration of histamine 460 mg∙kg- 1 above the allowed limit in a sample of tuna sampled from a fish shop. The same bacterium was found in samples of Atlantic horse mackerel (Trachurus trachurus). High histamine concentration (between 258 and > 300 mg∙kg- 1) were observed in salted <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> and European anchovy (228 mg∙kg- 1) sold loose in supermarkets. Because temperature abuse could occur when Tuna (fresh/defrozen) are hold on chopping board to sell fresh cuts and during shelf life of salted pilchard and pickled anchovies held in opened cans in chilled display cabinets for extended period, which might results in very high histamine concentration, controls on time and temperature at the retail, in addition to those done during the harvest and processing are needed. The studies aiming at quantitatively assess the prevalence and number of histamine producing bacteria in fish products that were not involved in histamine poisoning cases and/or do not show high level of histamine are rather complex, requiring many tests for confirming the histamine forming ability of the suspect isolated strains and further studies are needed to develop techniques for enumerating the histamine producing bacteria...|$|E

The structure of furan fatty acids {{is similar to that}} of some prostaglandins (a five-membered ring with an alkyl chain and an alkyl carboxylic chain). The biological role of the FFA is still not clear, but it has been pointed out that FFA act as antioxidants as they prevent linoleic acid oxidation. The connection between consumption of fish rich in FFA and protection against coronary heart disease mortality has been confirmed in several research studies. In the present study, the fatty acid profile of six species of Adriatic fishes (<b>european</b> <b>pilchard,</b> european anchovy, european hake, horse mackerel, common sole, atlantic mackerel), three species of freshwater fish (perch, indigenous catfish, trout) and three molluscs (clam, mussel, oyster) were determined. The identification of different FFA obtained from muscle, liver, testes, ovaries, eyes and brain was carried out using comprehensive bidimensional gaschromatography coupled on-line with mass spectrometry. The identified FFA were both the saturated series 10, 13 -epoxy- 11 -methyloctadeca- 10, 12 -dienoic acid [MonoMe(9, 5) ], 10, 13 -epoxy- 11, 12 -dimethyloctadeca- 10, 12 -dienoic acid [DiMe(9, 5) ], 12, 15 -epoxy- 13, 14 -dimethyloctadeca- 12, 14 -dienoic acid [DiMe(11, 3) ], 12, 15 -epoxy- 13 -methyleicosa- 12, 14 -dienoic acid [MonoMe(11, 5) ], 12, 15 -epoxy- 13, 14 -dimethyleicosa- 12, 14 -dienoic acid [DiMe(11, 5) ], 14, 17 -epoxy- 15, 16 -dimethyldocosa- 14, 16 -dienoic acid [DiMe(13, 5) ], and the unsaturated series 12, 15 -epoxy- 13, 14 -dimethyleicosa- 12, 15, 16 -trienoic acid [DiMe(11, 5 : 1) ], 12, 15 -epoxy- 13, 14 -dimethyleicosa- 10, 12, 14 -trienoic acid [DiMe(11 : 1, 5) ]. The ubiquitary FFA were [MonoMe(9, 5) ], [DiMe(11, 3) ], [MonoMe(11, 5) ] and [DiMe(11, 5) ]. FFA were absent in the molluscs and in the indigenous catfish. The unsaturated FFA were absent in the testes and ovaries of european anchovy and european hak...|$|E
40|$|Purpose <b>European</b> <b>pilchard</b> captures {{constitute}} {{an important source}} of income for the Portuguese fishing sector. This raw material is used for a varied range of final seafood products, such as canning, fresh seafood consumption or bait for other fisheries. The Portuguese purse seining fleet, which concentrates most of the pilchard landings, has recently obtained the Marine Stewardship Council certification scheme, demonstrating the effort of the fleet to comply with sustainable fishing practices. However, this scheme does not consider the human inputs to the fishery, such as fuel consumption or the use of other materials and resources. Consequently, life-cycle methods, such as Life Cycle Assessment (LCA), have arisen to provide a thorough assessment of the environmental profile of fishing fleets. In the current study, LCA is combined with Data Envelopment Analysis (DEA), a management tool, {{in order to understand the}} eco-efficiency of the individual vessels that compose this fleet. Methods A 5 -step LCA+DEA method, previously used to assess resembling vessel samples, was used to examine the efficiency of 20 purse seiners in the northern Portugal for years 2011 and 2012. Individual Life Cycle Inventories (LCIs) were gathered for each vessel to perform, thereafter, the Life Cycle Impact Assessment (LCIA). DEA matrices were generated based on the LCI in order to obtain the efficiency values for each unit. Finally, based on the efficiency projections provided by the DEA model, a new LCIA was performed for inefficient vessels in order to calculate the potential environmental benefits of operating at higher levels of efficiency. Results and discussion The average efficiency of the fleet in the two different years of assessment was slightly above 60 %. Moreover, individual vessels showed a fairly low standard deviation across the 2 years of assessment, demonstrating that units with higher levels of efficiency tend to maintain these values through the analysed window. In fact, this result, given its strong correlation with fuel use, appears to have relation with the existence of a certain level of Bskipper effect^. Important environmental benefits, mainly linked to the optimisation of fuel resources, could be attained if inefficient vessels were to operate efficiently, especially in terms of two main impact categories: climate change and fossil depletion. Conclusions The results in this study confirm that fishing small-pelagic fish shows low energy intensity as compared to other fisheries. However, despite this worldwide tendency, the use of LCA+DEA confirms that substantial improvements in terms of optimising energy and material inputs, as well as in reducing environmental impacts, can be attained in these fishing fleets...|$|E
40|$|Introduction. Fish is an {{excellent}} source of essential nutrients such as essential amino acids, bioactive latty acids, minerals, vitamins, chitin and antioxidants. The nutritional benefit of fish lies, predominantly, in its lipid Iraction which is mainly composed of phospholipids (PL) and triacylglycerols (TAG) exceptionally rich of n- 3 polyunsaturated latty acids (n- 3 PUFA). Recently, fish PLs have attracted {{a great deal of attention}} as they are considered more efficient carriers of n- 3 PUFA than fish TAG in terms of n- 3 PUFA absorption in different tissues. In addition, fish PLs have also exhibited antitumoral and anti-inllammatory effects. Unfortunately, lish PLs are highly susceptible to lipid oxidation and to thermal damage due to excessive heating. The n- 3 PUFA chains in PLs are the primary targets of oxidation which can take piace during cooking processes. Since most fish are consumed cooked, the nutritional value of the final cooked product is of major importance lor human health. Especially, the determination of the effects of frying (a very popular method utilized lor fish cooking) on the n- 3 PUFA rich lipid fraction of fish will provide uselul inlormation to consumers and to lood industry to establish the fish quality. Purpose. This study was, therelore, conducted to determine the inlluence of deep fat frying process on PL composition of edible muscle (fillet) of Sardina pilchardus, a fish species commonly consumed in Mediterranean countries. Design/methodology. The effects of deep-fat frying performed using different culinary lats (extra virgin olive oil, conventional sunflower oil and high-oleic sunfiower oil) and different frying temperatures (160 and 180 °C) on the phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) and phosphatidylcholine (PC) molecular species composition (the preponderant fish phospholipid classes) were investigated. For each frying test, ten fish fillets were introduced into a deep fryer (capacity 2 L), in a closed environment, lor 5 min. The oil temperature prior to start frying has been set to established value (160 or 180 'C) and it was controlled by a specific digital thermometer. Each cooking procedure was done in triplicate. The PL molecular species composition was determined by high pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) coupled with a second order mass spectrometer (MS-MS) with electronebulization interface (ESI). Findings. The deep-fat frying process caused significative changes on PE and PC molecular species composition of the fish fillet. However, these changes were not related to the nature of the culinary fat and to the frying temperature. In all cases, the deep fat frying process caused a significative increase of the proportion of the PE and PC species formed by the combination of palmitic and docohexanoic acids and a significative decrease of the percentage of the PE and PC species formed by two docohexanoic acid residues.
