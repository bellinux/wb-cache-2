5|$|Injuries to the tracheobronchial tree {{within the}} chest may occur due to {{penetrating}} forces such as gunshot wounds, but {{are more often}} the result of blunt trauma. TBI due blunt forces usually results from high-energy impacts such as <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> height and motor vehicle accidents; the injury is rare in low-impact mechanisms. Injuries of the trachea cause about 1% of traffic-related deaths. Other potential causes are <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> high places and injuries in which the chest is crushed. Explosions are another cause.|$|E

5|$|Camouflage {{in large}} {{bodies of water}} differs {{markedly}} from camouflage on land. The environment {{is essentially the same}} on all sides. Light always <b>falls</b> <b>from</b> above, and there is generally no variable background to compare with trees and bushes. Three main camouflage methods predominate in water: transparency, reflection, and counter-illumination. Transparency and reflectivity are most important in the top 100 metres of the ocean; counter-illumination is the main method from 100 metres down to 1000 metres; while camouflage becomes less important in the dark waters below 1000 metres.|$|E

5|$|Koalas {{may live}} from 13 to 18 {{years in the}} wild. While female koalas usually live this long, males may die sooner because of their more {{hazardous}} lives.

Around six years of age, the koala's chewing teeth begin to wear down and their chewing efficiency decreases. Eventually, the cusps disappear completely and the animal will die of starvation.|$|E

Meanwhile, in the forest outside Camelot, Mary kills Lady Helen (Myles), a singer who is to perform at Uther's court, with a poppet. Mary assumes Helen's appearance using an enchantment, though her true hideous appearance can still be seen in her reflection (like in mirrors or water).|$|E
