40|$|The goat {{population}} in Great Britain (GB), which is mostly oriented to milk production, is {{small compared to}} that in other European Union (EU) countries and contributes a very {{small fraction of the}} total livestock production. The recent confirmation and cull of scrapie-affected goat herds has raised the concern that the risk of re-introducing scrapie by mass restocking after the cull of a scrapie-affected herd, may not have been fully considered at the time of implementing statutory eradication measures. A conditional probability model has been developed to estimate the probability of introducing at least one animal infected with classical scrapie into a British goat herd under two scenarios: restocking over one year under normal operating conditions (Scenario 1); and restocking post a whole <b>herd</b> <b>cull</b> as part of the compulsory eradication measures (Scenario 2). Several of the parameters were based on expert opinion, as there is a paucity of data regarding goat industry norms for all sectors. Considering all herds, of which 99 % have less than 100 animals, the probability of introduction is approximately 2 times higher for Scenario (2) than for Scenario (1). The risk of subsequently re-introducing the disease through the introduction of replacement stock is not insignificant, although it can be considered very low {{for the vast majority of}} herds (> 99 %). In the case of very large herds (> 1000 heads), mass restocking would almost certainly reintroduce the disease since it would require purchases from a very large number of herds...|$|E

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the survival rate of primiparous heifers within a large sample of herds across the UK and specifically to assess the association between age at first calving (AFC) on their survival. Data from 437 herds was re-structured for analysis.

Potential explanatory variables included AFC, <b>herd</b> size, <b>culling</b> rate within the whole herd, calving season, herd mean 305 d yield and herd mean calving interval. The mean within-herd culling rate for the primiparous heifers was 15. 9 %. The mean within-herd AFC was 29. 6 months, with 35. 9 % of heifers having an AFC greater than 30 months of age. Multivariable analysis revealed a negative association between survival rate of primiparous heifers and increasing AFC, and also associations with <b>herd</b> <b>culling</b> rate in older cows and calving season. This study highlights the importance of AFC for survival of primiparous heifers, as well the need to address heifer wastage in <b>herds</b> with high <b>culling</b> rates...|$|R
40|$|Abstract. Reproductive {{performance}} {{is a key}} driver of the economics of dairy and beef breeding herds. In the absence of hormonal treatment to induce or stimulate lactation, regular parturition and initiation of lactation are key events directly affecting the average daily milk production of dairy <b>herds,</b> <b>culling</b> decisions and farm gross margins. Thus efficient reproductive management is a critical prerequisite for sustainable dairy production. Economic modelling {{of the performance of}} both southern and northern Australian beef cattle breeding enterprises has demonstrated that cows which recommence cycling and readily conceive in response to the annual seasonal improvement in pasture quality and quantity return the greatest gross margin per hectare. The major factors affecting the weaning rate in beef breeding herds are interval after calving to resumption of normal ovulations, embryo-foetal survival and perinatal survival...|$|R

40|$|A culling {{model for}} use in {{seasonally}} calving New Zealand dairy herds (CowCHOP) was developed. The model uses information retrieved from an on farm information system (DairyWIN) as well as farmer input to calculate an economic ranking of all animals within the dairy herd. This economic ranking is used to identify those animals that are most and least desirable for retention in the <b>herd.</b> <b>Culling</b> information was obtained from current Dairy MAN user herds.

To understand removal risks and rates for <b>culling,</b> <b>herd</b> demographic data was analysis from a study on reproductive performance for the 1993 / 94 season. The study was limited to spring calving seasonal herds, typical of the New Zealand dairy industry. The New Zealand dairy industry is reliant on a largely pasture based production system which entails that herds calve annually during the spring months with a condensed calving pattern to optimise pasture utilisation. Cows are dried off in the late autumn for a dry period prior to the onset of calving the next season. This management system results in two periods of the season where cows are at greatest risk for removal, primarily early lactation and drying off...|$|R

Associations between culling and factors at both the individual and herd level were examined. In addition, {{the relative importance of}} individual animal and herd level influences on culling were investigated. The following individual cow culling risk factors: nonpregnancy, age, weaning weight index, calf outcome, abortion, prolapsed vagina, prolapsed uterus, calving injury, lameness and mastitis or udder problems were significantly associated with culling (p less than 0. 01). Two herd level factors were associated with increased culling rates: a higher than average proportion of heifers and a shorter than average calving season (p less than 0. 01). The proportion of culling variation attributed to individual animal and herd level influences varied with model type. While simple models (one-way ANOVA) indicated that the herd variance component for culling was relatively minor, more complex models indicated larger herd-to-herd variability (mixed model ANOVA). Thus, it appeared that the probability of culling for a cow with a given set of risk factors depended to an important extent on manager decisions in the herd of origin...|$|R

Using a geographical information system, 2 dispersion models — 1 simple and 1 complex — were used to assess historical exposures to sour gas emissions at 1382 dairy farm sites from 1985 through to 1994. Multivariable survival models, adjusting for the dependence of survival responses within a herd over time, as well as potential confounding variables, were utilized to determine associations between sour gas exposure estimates and the time from the first calving date to either death or culling of 150 210 dairy cows.

40|$|Cull {{cows are}} often {{overlooked}} {{as an important}} source of income to the cow-calf enterprise. Depending upon the relationships between cull cow and calf prices, and the <b>herd</b> <b>culling</b> rate, cull cow receipts generally account for 15 - 30 percent of income from the cow-calf enterprise. However, some producers give little attention to this source of income and ways of enhancing it. For many producers, cull cows are sold at the time culling takes place, and much of this culling is done in the late fall soon after calves are weaned. Is it most profitable to sell cows when they are culled, or should they be fed for a period of time? Several factors need to be considered to properly answer that question and that is {{the purpose of this paper}} and presentation. Cows are <b>culled</b> from a <b>herd</b> for a number of reasons and the reason for culling will most likely affect the time culling takes place and could alter the most profitable marketing strategy. Reproductive failure, problems resulting from old age, and unsatisfactory performance are the most common reasons for culling an animal. While reproductive failure is generally diagnosed in the fall of the year, culling for other reasons could take place at other times. Three factors of importance regarding the decision to sell cows when culled versus feeding them and selling at a latter time are: (1) the seasonality of cull cow prices, (2) the price difference between cull cow slaughter grades and the percentage of cull cows in each grade, and (3) the cost of feeding cull cows. Each of these factors will be discussed in some detail...|$|R

40|$|Reproductive {{failure is}} {{consistently}} a top reason for culling beef cows from the <b>herd.</b> <b>Culling</b> young females is very costly to commercial producers because a young female hasn’t generated enough income {{to pay for}} the cost of developing that female. One way to improve reproductive performance in the cowherd is through genetics. Although reproductive traits tend to be lowly heritable, genetic improvement can be made through selection. Beef producers traditionally have selected for increased scrotal circumference to improve female fertility. Scrotal circumference is an indicator trait and is positively correlated to female reproductive performance. Faster genetic improvement could be made by selecting for an easy-to-measure, economically relevant trait. The American Hereford Association’s whole-herd reporting program has enabled the collection of more difficult-to-measure phenotypes such as reproductive performance. Producers enrolled in the program must report the reproductive status of all breeding- age females on a yearly basis. This reporting system includes information such as if a female was exposed for breeding and if she calved the following year. Traits like heifer calving rate and the likelihood that daughters will calve as a heifer if they were retained as replacements can be developed based on the data reported by Hereford breeders. Our objective was to estimate the heritability of heifer calving rate, an economically relevant trait...|$|R

40|$|To {{minimize}} the potential consequences of an introduction of foot-and-mouth disease (FMD) in Europe, European Union (EU) member states {{are required to}} present a contingency plan. This study used a simulation model to study potential outbreak scenarios in Sweden and evaluate the best control strategies. The model was informed by the Swedish livestock structure using herd information from cattle, pig, and small ruminant holdings in the country. The contact structure was based on animal movement data and studies investigating the movements between farms of veterinarians, service trucks, and other farm visitors. All scenarios of outbreak control included depopulation of detected herds, 3 [*]km protection and 10 [*]km surveillance zones, movement tracing, and 3 [*]days national standstill. The effect of availability of surveillance resources, i. e., number of field veterinarians per day, and timeliness of enforcement of interventions, was assessed. With the estimated currently available resources, an FMD outbreak in Sweden {{is expected to be}} controlled (i. e., last infected herd detected) within 3 [*]weeks of detection in any evaluated scenario. The density of farms in the area where the epidemic started would have little impact on the time to control the outbreak, but spread in high density areas would require more surveillance resources, compared to areas of lower farm density. The use of vaccination did not result in a reduction in the expected number of infected herds.

Today, the only stock allowed in the park are pack horses and mules, which are only permitted in certain areas along major trails, and usually not early in the season in order to protect meadows in the spring while they are wet and soft.|$|R
30|$|Indeed, {{discussions with}} agriculturalists (Vadjunec 2015; Fagin 2016) suggest that woody plant {{encroachment}} has been {{exacerbated by the}} extended drought coupled with certain land management decisions (e.g., overgrazing) and complex, constraining, and often conflicting governance practices, particularly on State Trust Lands. In periods of extreme moisture deficits, grazing pressure (ratio of demand/availability of forage) increases, even though the state attempts to control such measures by setting stocking rates. Land managers often must balance the needs of short-term profit over long-term ecological health, especially during recovery periods when stocking rates may technically increase, but historically ranchers would usually let the land rest to ensure long-term recovery. When permanency on a track of land is not guaranteed, land managers may be more reluctant to <b>cull</b> <b>herds</b> to more sustainable levels, to follow set grazing guidelines, or to let State Trust Land rest as needed, resulting in overgrazing and, thus, presumably woody plant encroachment.|$|R
