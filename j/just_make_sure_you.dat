2500|$|The {{argument}} {{was based on}} comments by K. Shanmugam, the Minister for Law, at a dialogue session on 9 May 2010. When asked whether Yong's case would affect Singapore's laws on the mandatory death penalty, the Minister had replied: [...] "Yong Vui Kong is young. But if we say, 'We let you go', what's the signal we're sending? ... We are sending a signal to all drug barons out there: <b>Just</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> choose a victim who's young or a mother of a young child and use them as the people to carry drugs into Singapore." [...] Commenting to the media, Ravi {{said that if the}} clemency decision was indeed taken by the Cabinet and not the President, then since Shanmugam {{was a member of the}} Cabinet and these statements were made while Yong's case was sub judice, his remarks implied a prejudgment of Yong's appeal for clemency. The Ministry of Law rejected as [...] "incorrect" [...] Ravi's remarks that the clemency process was flawed. It stated that as the Government's policy on the death penalty for drug offences was a [...] "matter of public importance", the Government was entitled to comment on it. The Law Ministry also clarified that Shanmugam's comments were merely concerned with the Government's legislative policy and whether it would change, and that the Minister had not commented on any specific issue which was before the Court of Appeal at the time, or on what the outcome of the judgment should be.|$|E

5000|$|My {{problem with}} the pre-Ravelstein Bellow is that he all too often strains too hard to yoke {{together}} two somewhat contradictory aspects of his being and style.

[...] Miller wrote that the graphics [...] "are unimpressive, but don't particularly detract from the overall experience. The voice work is so good that it's a little disconcerting to see it synced up with the odd looking character models that make up Scully and Mulder." [...] Miller concluded that [...] "X-Files fans will be more forgiving of Resist or Serve {{when it comes to the}} hokey gameplay, but even casual acquaintances of the series will appreciate the effort Black Ops put into the package as a whole. True, this is basically a toned-down Resident Evil with X-Files pasted on top, but Resident Evil hasn't been this interesting for a long time!" ...|$|R

Whether it is furniture, a light bulb, or a giant crocodile, Wilson treats each {{as a work of}} art in its own right. He demands that a full-scale model of each prop be constructed before the final one is made, in order [...] "to check proportion, balance, and visual relationships" [...] on stage. Once he has approved the model, the crew builds the prop, and Wilson is [...] "renowned for sending them back {{again and again and again}} until they satisfy him". He is so strict in his attention to detail that when Jeff Muscovin, his tech director for Quartett, suggested they use an aluminum chair with a wood skin rather than a completely wooden chair, Wilson replied:No, Jeff, I want wood chairs. If we make them out of aluminum, they won't sound right when they fall over and hit the floor. They'll sound like metal, not wood. It will sound false. <b>Just</b> <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> <b>you</b> get strong wood. And no knots.Such attention to detail and perfectionism usually resulted in an expensive collection of props.

They further noted that while being a [...] "badass", he stands out thanks to his kindness. The same website listed him as a notorious anti-hero as he [...] "walks a fine line between good and bad." [...] Cheat Code Central expressed similar comments noting that despite the character's occupation, he is so kind he takes the blame of Dojima's death in the start of the first game resulting in the expulsion from his family. Eurogamer similarly commented that [...] "Despite all the violence, Kazuma is quite a personable bloke, whose love for his friends sees him banged up for ten years over a murder his [...] "brother" [...] Nishiki committed."

When reviewing Yakuza 3, Sam Marchello from RPGamer noted the character's notable development comparing his life with the Yakuza to the orphans. Greg Miller from IGN noted how developers wanted players to connect to Kiryu's side in Yakuza 3 as a result of being his motivation, resulting in several cutscenes and minigames which left him mixed feelings. Anthony John Agnello from GamesRadar praised Kiryu's initial appearance alongside his personality. Anime News Network writer Dustin Bailey praised Kiryu's role in Yakuza 0 saying that while in most of the games he has portrayed as a [...] "saintly Superman", in the prequel he liked how the character was involved in darker scenarios.|$|R

About the video, the rapper tweeted the following: [...] "Just wait until you see what these super sweet biker dudes are doing in my video". PopCrush blogged about the video, saying: [...] "clearly, Kesha, who is quite pretty, is going for the dork look, like Katy Perry did in her 'Last Friday Night (T.G.I.F.)' video. But instead of a headgear-and-braces-wearing nerd, she's more of a gangsta geek". Calling the video [...] "an invitation to a lazy-Sunday house party", Canada's MuchMusic wrote that Kesha's [...] "ghetto fabulous" [...] hair and the Hells Angels bikers make the video complete, and that they [...] "loved it". MTV called Kesha's look [...] "eye-popping couture", suggesting the sunglasses as being inspired by Elton John and the braids by fellow rappers Riff Raff and Brooke Candy. Fashion writer Mickey Woods of Glamour affirmed the Brooke Candy comparison. New York magazine' music blog, Vulture, documented a high volume of occult symbolism, specifically that which is conventionally associated with modern perceptions of the Bavarian Illuminati. Amanda Dobbins, the reviewer, toyed with the possibility of Kesha being a whistleblower for the cult, displaying the symbols such as the all-seeing eye tattooed on the rapper's palm, both overtly and excessively in the [...] "Crazy Kids" [...] video. Dobbins wrote: [...] "She keeps waving it around, too, <b>just</b> to <b>make</b> <b>sure</b> that <b>you</b> see it and get mildly anxious about her Illuminati associations." [...] Conversely, Dobbins suggested Kesha is serving consumers the Illuminati angle to snag more views, as Billboard and other mainstream music critics reported with the music video for [...] "Die Young". MTV reported a similar position, noticing a trend with the singer and ocular-themed accessories, namely nail art.
