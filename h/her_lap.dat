5|$|After Taft and Leale opened Lincoln's {{shirt and}} found no stab wound, Leale located the gunshot wound behind the left ear. He found the bullet too deep to be removed, but was able to {{dislodge}} a clot, after which Lincoln's breathing improved; he learned that regularly removing new clots maintained Lincoln's breathing. As actress Laura Keene cradled the President's head in <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> he pronounced the wound mortal.|$|E
5|$|As {{with other}} early van der Weyden {{depictions of the}} Madonna, her head is {{slightly}} too large for her body. Her dress is creased and almost paper-like. However, the description of <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> contains inconsistencies also in Campin's Virgin and Child before a Firescreen; it appears to lack volume and is if she had only one leg. This seems to reflect an early difficulty both with foreshortening and in the depiction of a body under clothing.|$|E
5|$|The Child has curly {{blond hair}} and sits on a white cloth, {{animated}} and upright, {{at the side of}} the Virgin's lap. Like Mary, his body is shown frontally, his head in three quarters view. He reaches for what seems to be a parrot perched on <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> At some point the Child's nudity was covered up; this overpaint was removed during a late 20th-century restoration. He is intended to represent both the host and Eucharist, common allusions in Early Netherlandish art and reflecting that the panel was intended for the celebration of mass.|$|E

5|$|The Vishnudharmottara Purana {{describes}} a six-armed Varahi, holding a danda (staff of punishment), khetaka (shield), khadga (sword) and pasha (noose) in four {{hands and the}} two remaining hands being held in Abhaya and Varada Mudra ("blessing gesture"). She also holds a shakti and hala (plough). Such a Varahi sculpture is found at Abanesi, depicted with the dancing Shiva. She may also be depicted holding a child sitting on <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> like Matrikas are often depicted.|$|E
5|$|The {{painting}} was widely {{influential in the}} 15th and 16th centuries. The set piece of Van Eyck's enthroned Virgin, with a distracted Child on <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> was both widely copied, and became a standard for the following 150 years. There are numerous surviving contemporary close and free copies, the most significant {{of which is the}} Royal Museum of Fine Arts Antwerp. Adriaen Isenbrandt included van der Paele's head in his Mass of St Gregory of 1550.|$|E
5|$|A {{few feet}} {{to his right}} sits his wife, darning the clothes on <b>her</b> <b>lap</b> and those sprawled on the floor, while a crying infant, who is upset and hungry, goes {{unattended}} in the only bed. Next to the poet's wife, by the open door, an angry milkmaid presents her substantial bill, demanding payment for milk, underlining the poet's refusal to provide for his family by getting himself a proper job. The cupboard stands open and empty, save for a mouse; near the door, a dog steals {{the last of the}} family's food from a plate.|$|E

5|$|The Virgin and Child with Canon van der Paele {{is a large}} oil-on-oak panel {{painting}} completed around 1434–36 by the Early Netherlandish painter Jan van Eyck. It {{shows the}} painting's donor, Joris van der Paele, within an apparition of saints. The Virgin Mary is enthroned at {{the centre of the}} semicircular space, which most likely represents a church interior, with the Christ Child on <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> St. Donatian stands to her right, Saint George—the donor's name saint—to her left. The panel was commissioned by van der Paele as an altarpiece. He was then a wealthy clergyman from Bruges, but elderly and gravely ill, and intended the work as his memorial.|$|E
5|$|In early 1936, Thomas met Caitlin Macnamara (1913–1994), a 22-year-old blonde-haired, blue-eyed dancer of Irish descent. She had {{run away}} from home, intent on making a career in dance, and aged 18 joined the chorus line at the London Palladium. Introduced by Augustus John, Caitlin's lover, they met in The Wheatsheaf pub on Rathbone Place in London's West End. Laying his head in <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> a drunken Thomas proposed. Thomas liked to comment that he and Caitlin were in bed {{together}} ten minutes after they first met. Although Caitlin initially continued her relationship with John, she and Thomas began a correspondence, {{and in the second}} half of 1936 were courting. They married at the register office in Penzance, Cornwall, on 11 July 1937. In early 1938 they moved to Wales, renting a cottage in the village of Laugharne, Carmarthenshire. Their first child, Llewelyn Edouard, was born on 30 January 1939.|$|E
5|$|The chancel {{contains}} memorials to the Lords Stanley of Alderley. The {{memorial to}} John Stanley, 1st Baron Stanley of Alderley contains his effigy dressed in peer's robes lying under a canopy {{with his hand}} on a book, dated 1856 and by Richard Westmacott. On {{the other side of the}} chancel is a memorial to his son Edward Stanley, his effigy holding a scroll in his hand and with a dog at his feet. Engraved in brass on the side of the memorial are the figures of his widow and children. Lady Stanley is seated in the middle with their four surviving sons on her right, five surviving daughters on her left and three children who had died at a young age at her knee and on <b>her</b> <b>lap.</b> A memorial tablet to John Constantine Stanley, who died in 1878, is by Joseph Boehm. The chancel contains a monument to Rev.Edward Shipton, rector of the church from 1625 to 1630.|$|E

5|$|Folklorist John F. Campbell noted a {{story told}} on Islay, {{one of the}} Inner Hebridean islands, which {{demonstrates}} the usefulness of having a water bull. Just after a calf was born to an ordinary cow, an elderly lady, later identified as a witch, advised the herdsman to keep it separate from the other cattle, presumably after she noticed its deformed ears and suspected it was a water bull. She instructed the herdsman to rear the calf on milk from three different cows and to keep it confined in a stable {{for a minimum of}} seven years. Years later, a young woman was grazing cattle at a nearby loch when she was approached by an attractive man. He struck up a conversation with her and shortly afterwards the pair sat on the grass with his head resting in <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> but as he fell asleep she discovered seaweed entwined in his hair, a sign that he was a water horse. She started to run back to the farm. Her suitor awoke, shapeshifted into his true equine form and chased after her. As the woman ran towards the farm, the witch shouted to the herdsman to release the water bull from the stable. The two creatures fought until they fell into the sea. The water horse never returned, but the remains of the bull were found the following day.|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on <b>her</b> <b>lap,</b> and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden in the folds of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E
