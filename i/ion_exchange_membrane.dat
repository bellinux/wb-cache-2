However, the degradation mechanism of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> has been rarely investigated especially for anion <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes.</b> Here, the degradation mechanism of polysulfone based anion <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes,</b> carrying pyridine <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> groups, under vanadium flow battery (VFB) medium was investigated in detail. We find that sp(2) hybrid orbital interactions between pyridinic-nitrogen in 4, 4 '-bipyridine and benzylic carbon disrupt the charge state balance of pristine chloromethylated polysulfone. This difference in electronegativity inversely induces an electrophilic carbon center in the benzene ring, which can be attacked by the lone pair electron on the vanadium(V) oxygen species, further leading to the degradation of polymer backbone, while leaving the 4, 4 '-bipyridine <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> groups stable. This work represents a step toward design and construction of alternative type of chemically stable hydrocarbon <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> for VFB...|$|R

40|$|Ionic polymer metal {{composites}} (IPMCs) {{have been}} an attractive research subject for use in underwater robotic applications, biomedical and biomimetic application owing to their great potential as actuators, artificial muscles, and more. IPMC is synthetic composite nanomaterial of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> and metal electrode. Although both components are important, the properties of <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> should be emphasized since it is responsible of the path for the mobile ions to migrate when voltage is applied to exhibit deformation. Most of the researches {{that have been done}} on IPMCs used commercially available Nafion as their <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes.</b> However, its high cost, limitations in thermal and mechanical properties are some of the disadvantages that needs to be modified. In this thesis, we chose two different polymers, poly(vinyl alcohol-co-ethylene) [P(VA-co-E) ] and polyimide [PI], as blending partners of Nafion in order to overcome these disadvantages while maintaining high ionic conductivity. In chapter 2, blend <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> of Nafion and P(VA-co-E) were casted using physical blending method. The membranes were characterized by Fourier transform infrared spectroscopy and differential scanning calorimetry. IPMCs based on these membranes were fabricated by deposition of platinum electrode onto their surface via electroless plating process. The electrode surface of prepared IPMCs was measured using two point probe method. The cross-sectional morphologies of the IPMCs were characterized through Scanning electron microscopy and Energy-dispersive X-ray spectroscopy analysis was done. The electromechanical performances (displacement and blocking force) of the prepared IPMC actuators were further characterized. In chapter 3, blend <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membranes</b> of Nafion and PI were obtained by casting of Nafion and poly(amic acid) [PAA]membranes and the following thermal imidization.

40|$|Perchlorate {{has entered}} human and {{environmental}} food chains and {{has received a}} great deal of attention because of its toxicity to humans. In this study, chemical degradation of perchlorate was investigated using partially oxidized titanium ions (Ti 2 + and Ti 3 +) in solutions and as part of an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membrane</b> reactor system. Aqueous titanium ions (Ti 2 + and Ti 3 +) were applied to remove perchlorate ions and its destructive mechanism, reaction kinetics, and the effect of environmental factors were investigated. Titanium ions were able to degrade perchlorate ions very rapidly with half life less than one hour under conditions of high acid concentrations. A new reactor system with an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membrane</b> was adapted to apply better the reactions of perchlorate destruction to water treatment practice. A novel treatment method was developed by integrating partially oxidized titanium ions with an <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membrane,</b> and it is named the Titanium and Membrane Hybrid System (TMH System). The results shown in this research demonstrate the feasibility of TMH System for perchlorate reduction. The perchlorate ions were rapidly adsorbed onto the <b>ion</b> <b>exchange</b> <b>membrane</b> and diffused through it, but they were reduced by titanium ions in the degradation zone relatively slowly. To enhance the overall rate of reaction, high concentrations of acid and Ti(III) are needed, but transport of hydrogen ions through the anion permeable membrane was observed and would be greater at higher acid concentrations. The proposed mathematical model predicts the performance and behavior of the TMH system for different physical and chemical conditions. It successfully described adsorption, diffusion and reduction of perchlorate in the system. This model could be used as an important tool for process design and optimization...|$|E
