40|$|The paper {{employs a}} rank-dependent {{formulation}} of the social welfare function with time-separable utilities to evaluate the economic consequences of income mobility from an ex-ante perspective. The resultant class of measures can be decomposed {{not only in terms}} of structural and <b>exchange</b> <b>mobility</b> but also in terms of vertical and horizontal mobility, thereby encompassing two of the main approaches in the literature. We illustrate our measurement framework by comparing mobility in the USA and Germany using data from the Cross-National Equivalent File 1980 - 2005. We find that the pattern of income mobility in the USA was both less pro-poor and more horizontally inequitable than in Germany, but that the latter did not translate into higher levels of <b>exchange</b> <b>mobility</b> given higher levels of absolute inequality and the vertical stance of the growth process. income mobility, ex-ante welfare analysis, USA, Germany...|$|E

30|$|In principle, the {{similarities}} and differences between children’s and parents’ religious identities can be attributed to two distinct social forces: <b>exchange</b> <b>mobility</b> and structural mobility (Hu and Leamaster 2015). The former is meant to discover transmission mechanisms at the micro level, such as parenthood, gender, and ethnicity, that result in systematical religious inheritance or deviation across generations due to people’s choices. The latter focuses on macrolevel structural change, such as transition of the religious market or fashion, which regulates the extent of opportunities for religious choice for the two generations. Social learning theory and religious capital theory pay close attention to the former, and religious economy theory provides analytical framework for the latter.|$|E

40|$|Preliminary version. Not to be quoted {{without the}} authors ' permission.

An illustration of the index based on data from Moldova shows how the index may be better suited than conventional measures to treat problems such as relative deprivation across genders or to trace real changes of subjective deprivation over time...|$|E

30|$|One {{potential}} {{contribution of}} this article may be {{the analysis of the}} switching and transmission patterns of Christianity in Taiwan. Contrary to predictions derived from religious market theory, the exclusive and highly institutional religion does not show an advantage over either structural or <b>exchange</b> <b>mobility</b> since only 56 % of believers keep their original beliefs. Buddhism is a more attractive destination than folk religions, No Religion, or Daoism. How can this disadvantage of Christianity be explained? One reasonable explanation is that the continuity with the uniform dimension ranging from conservative to liberal is incompatible with China’s religious landscape. Religious mobility measured or explained by this continuity thus provides only limited insights into understanding the mobility pattern of diversified religions. For Chinese people, religious membership is cumulative and alternative rather than exclusive and restrictive, resulting in a common ambiguity of religious identity at the aggregate level (Yang 1961; Jordan 1993). This accumulation may result in a disadvantage for Christianity.|$|E

30|$|Based on pooled data {{drawn from}} a {{representative}} Taiwan Social Change Survey dataset, this article analyzes the pattern of transmission of religious belief from parents to adult children in Taiwan from 1999 to 2009. As a society imbued with diverse religious traditions, Taiwan as a region of China serves as an ideal point of departure to examine religious mobility beyond the Western and monotheistic world. The article has three main findings. First, there is a gendered pattern in <b>exchange</b> <b>mobility.</b> Mothers play a stronger role than fathers overall, but Christian families have an inverse situation. Sons {{are more likely to}} adopt their parents’ religious belief than daughters. Second, a parent’s capacity to transmit his/her religious belief greatly depends on the religious group to which he/she belongs. Daoism shows more robustness than other religions in transgenerational transmission, which contradicts the prediction drawn from religious economy theory. Third, religious communities significantly differ from each other in structural mobility. Buddhism has the highest retentive capacity for reducing religious switching, and folk religions have the highest attractive capacity to win over switchers from other religious communities.|$|E

30|$|Host-based {{mobility}} protocols, such as MIPv 6 and its derivatives, involve MNs in all mobility signaling. An MN {{is designed}} to <b>exchange</b> numerous <b>mobility</b> messages, including binding updates and binding acknowledgments when it changes its network link, thereby quickly depleting its energy. Thus, the use of host-based mobility in low-power WSN devices is very inefficient [20 – 22]. Moreover, a WSN consists of {{a huge number of}} sensor nodes that may perform handoffs nearly simultaneously, leading to a large handoff signaling overhead that further increase energy consumption [19]. Thus, researchers have been motivated to continuously design new mobility management protocols suitable for sensor group mobility.|$|R
