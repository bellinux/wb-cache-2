5|$|In 2015 John Butt and the Dunedin Consort {{released}} {{a recording of}} the E-flat major version {{in the context of}} a reconstructed Christmas service as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been heard in Leipzig in 1723. The recording includes organ music and congregational hymn singing.|$|E
5|$|In the Age of Sail, {{deception}} {{was often}} used by ships, and paint was applied ad hoc by ships' captains for temporary tactical advantage. A ship might be painted {{to look like}} another, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> its cannon ports hidden by painted canvas to look harmless, or <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> additional cannon ports painted on to appear more powerful. For example, {{in one of his}} battles during 1778–1782, American privateer Jonathan Haraden hid the guns of his ship the General Pickering, to appear {{as if it were a}} slow merchant ship. Haraden allowed his ship to be approached at close range by a much faster British privateer, then he quickly pulled the painted canvas away and delivered a full broadside, capturing the enemy.|$|E
5|$|Temporary repairs {{were made}} to the building. While <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been salvageable, albeit with almost {{complete}} reconstruction, a decision was taken to build a new cathedral in a modern style instead, a step which had been contemplated even before the fire. Wren declared {{that it was impossible to}} restore the old building.|$|E

5|$|The only Canadian, {{and also}} last known {{specimen}} {{of the sea}} mink (Mustela macrodon) was captured on Campobello Island, New Brunswick in 1894. It is unknown whether the species was ever native to the country, but an unidentified animal reported in 1785 suggest <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been {{more common in the}} Maritimes.|$|E
5|$|As Threni was {{intended}} for concert rather than liturgical use, Stravinsky chose the text freely from the early chapters of the Book of Lamentations. It has three movements: the large central movement is surrounded by two much shorter ones. Ernst Krenek composed a setting of the Lamentations in 1942, and Stravinsky acknowledged that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> influenced him. He considered it less likely that works by Renaissance composers, including Tallis, Byrd and Palestrina, had influenced him, although he had studied such music.|$|E
5|$|English Heritage {{took over}} {{management}} of the castle in 1983, and stripped back 20th-century additions to present it as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> appeared in 1914, including demolishing the old signal station tower. The site remains open to visitors and received 5,751 visitors in 2010. The castle is protected under UK law as a Grade II* listed building and as a scheduled monument. The air station's former hangars are still used as a recreation centre by Hampshire County Council.|$|E

5|$|If {{the bell}} was rung, {{it would have}} been most likely rung by Andrew McNair, who was the doorkeeper both of the Assembly and of the Congress, and was {{responsible}} for ringing the bell. As McNair was absent on two unspecified days between April and November, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been rung by William Hurry, who succeeded him as doorkeeper for Congress. Bells were also rung to celebrate the first anniversary of Independence on July 4, 1777.|$|E
5|$|Posner also {{rejected}} {{the argument that}} the defendants were removing the painting to save Chicago from racial riots that the continued showing of the painting might have started, and in which <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been destroyed. He found that Tillman herself threatened to burn the painting on the spot, {{and that there was no}} mob. In addition, the court found that because Nelson had not intended to provoke a riot, the First Amendment could still be used to protect his speech.|$|E
5|$|The {{cessation}} of menstrual cycles {{at the end}} of a woman's reproductive period is termed menopause. The average age of menopause in women is 52 years, with anywhere between 45 and 55 being common. Menopause before age 45 is considered premature in industrialised countries. Like the age of menarche, the age of menopause is largely a result of cultural and biological factors; however, illnesses, certain surgeries, or medical treatments may cause menopause to occur earlier than <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> otherwise.|$|E

5|$|The {{planners}} then examined {{whether a}} commando force was feasible {{to accomplish the}} task. An unusually high spring tide was due in March 1942 which would allow a light ship to pass over the sand banks in the estuary and approach the docks, bypassing the heavily defended dredged channel. The approach was too shallow for an infantry landing ship, but the planners believed if a destroyer could be lightened <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> a draft shallow enough to enable it to get through.|$|E
5|$|After the conflict, Portland Castle was {{transferred}} to the Ministry of Works in 1949 and opened to the public in 1955. The Ministry decided to present the interior as <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> looked in the 16th century and removed most of the 19th- and 20th-century additions and changes. The Captain's House and the adjacent gardens were used by the neighbouring HMS Osprey helicopter base until 1999, but with the facility's closure, this part of the fort was also opened to visitors, the house being turned into a visitor facility.|$|E
5|$|Relationships between B.cuneata and {{the other}} members of B.subg. Isostylis still remain unclear. Though Mast's studies found B.cuneata to be the most basal of the three species, a 2004 study of genetic {{divergence}} within the subgenus yielded both other possibilities: some analyses suggested B.ilicifolia as basal, while others suggested B.oligantha. Further complicating the situation is the southernmost population of B.cuneata, which has both genetic and phenetic affinities with B.oligantha located to the southeast. The origin of this population is unknown. <b>It</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> arisen through hybridisation, or it may be a transitional or even ancestral form. Finally, biogeographical factors suggest that B.ilicifolia would be the most basal of the three species: it occurs in the High Rainfall Zone where relictual species are most common, whereas the others are restricted to the Transitional Rainfall Zone, where more recently evolved species are most common.|$|E

5|$|Rieve and his {{executive}} officer were both severely criticized {{for failing to}} take all possible steps to save Karlsruhe in a later investigation into the sinking. The report concluded that since the ship was still afloat after two hours, and two torpedoes were required to sink her, <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been possible to take her under tow back to Kristiansand or another port. In addition, the forward pumps still had power, and so the flooding could have been slowed enough to permit {{a return to a}} safe harbor.|$|E
5|$|Some repairs {{were made}} in 1604 by Alessandro Stafrace, after cracks {{appeared}} in part of the Main Hall. The auberge had an entrance facing a square in South Street, but this was blocked in 1629 when the square was built up (the square was recreated in 2012 as Jean de Valette Square). Historian Giovanni Bonello suggests {{that this was the}} main entrance of the auberge, although <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> just been a side entrance. In 1649–50, a mezzanine was built beneath the Admiral's Room, and a large room {{at the rear of the}} building was converted into four shops in 1654. The archives were constructed in 1678.|$|E
5|$|Sutherst {{said the}} scratch marks {{appeared}} in photographs taken on 10 September 1985, 34 {{days after the}} murders, but were not visible in the original crime-scene photographs. He also said {{he had failed to}} find in the photographs any chipped paint on the carpet below the mantelpiece, where <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been expected to fall had the mantelpiece been scratched during a struggle. He was asked by the CCRC to examine a red spot on the carpet visible in photographs underneath the scratches on the mantelpiece. He said the red spot matched a piece of nail varnish missing from one of Sheila's toes. He concluded that the scratch marks on the mantel had been created after the day of the murders.|$|E

5|$|The 1893–94 {{season was}} the 13th season of {{competitive}} association football and second {{season in the}} Football League played by Small Heath F.C., an English football club based in Birmingham. In 1892–93, the inaugural season of the Football League Second Division, Small Heath had won the divisional championship but failed to gain promotion via the test match system. This year, they finished as distant runners-up in the League, eight points behind Liverpool, but were successful in the test match, defeating Darwen 3–1 to confirm {{their place in the}} First Division for the 1894–95 Football League season. The club struggled financially during the season, and there were suggestions that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> disbanded had promotion not been secured.|$|E
5|$|The 1894–95 {{season was}} the 14th season of {{competitive}} association football and third {{season in the}} Football League played by Small Heath F.C., an English football club based in Birmingham.

The club had struggled financially during the season, and there were suggestions that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> disbanded had promotion not been secured. In their first season in the First Division, they finished in 12th place in the 16-team division, thus avoiding the possibility of relegation via the test matches.|$|E
5|$|The {{bulk of the}} {{remastering}} {{work was}} outsourced to the Shanghai-based studio Virtuos. Square Enix's internal staff was responsible for reassembling the original assets, and helped with a part of redoing the high-definition data. Among the returning original team members were Motomu Toriyama, Yusuke Naora, Toshitaka Matsuda and Masaki Kobayashi who supervised the production. X-2 art director Shintaro Takai remained in the same role for both remastered games. The Chinese side of development was headed by managing director Pan Feng. The team encountered problems in porting the games to PlayStation 3 and Vita as their graphics used many functionalities unique to the PlayStation 2 hardware. The loss and repair {{of some of the}} original assets posed another hurdle, with Kitase commenting that <b>it</b> <b>might</b> <b>have</b> been easier to recreate the data from the ground up.|$|E
