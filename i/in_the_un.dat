During the planning of the Chinese Second Phase Campaign, Peng would again focus his attention towards the ROK II Corps at the Eighth Army's right flank, resulting in a disastrous defeat for the UN forces at the Battle of the Ch'ongch'on River. To commemorate this battle as China's official entry into the Korean War, October 25 is currently the War to Resist America and Aid Korea Memorial Day in China.|$|E
5|$|As {{with most}} of the {{principles}} adopted by the League, the Minorities Treaties were a part of the Wilsonian idealist approach to international relations, and as with the League itself, the Minority Treaties were increasingly ignored by the respective governments, with the entire system mostly collapsing in the late 1930s.

5|$|Historians {{contend that}} for the UN and North Korea, locked in a bitter battle where neither could gain the upper hand, {{logistics}} {{was among the most}} important determining factors in how the war would progress. As the disparity in logistics capability widened between the UN and North Korean forces, the well-supported UN troops were able to hold their positions along the Pusan Perimeter, while the morale and the fighting quality of NKPA deteriorated as resupplies became increasingly unreliable. This trend ultimately culminated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> recapturing Seoul, the key logistics center of the battle, and the collapse of the North Korean logistics system with the entire NKPA.|$|E

5|$|In the Official History of Australian Peacekeeping, Humanitarian and Post-Cold War Operations, author David Horner {{stated that}} the Australian {{government}} led by Robert Menzies was loath to criticise South Africa during the 1950s.

Indeed, as late as 1961 Australia (and Britain) abstained from a vote to condemn South Africa <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN.</b>|$|E

5|$|The North Koreans {{subsequently}} {{planned a}} simultaneous offensive for their entire army along five axes of the perimeter; and on September 1 intense fighting erupted around {{the cities of}} Masan, Kyongju, Taegu, Yongch'on and the Naktong Bulge.

Initially successful in some areas, the North Koreans were unable to hold their gains against the numerically and technologically superior UN force. The North Korean army, again stalled at the failure of this offensive, was subsequently destroyed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> counterattack at Inchon.|$|E

5|$|After {{four hours}} of negotiations, the {{agreement}} was signed by Croatian Defence Minister Gojko Šušak and deputy commander of the JNA's 5th Military District Lieutenant Colonel General Andrija Rašeta in Sarajevo, Bosnia and Herzegovina, on 2 January 1992. It was the 15th ceasefire agreement signed {{since the start of}} the Croatian War of Independence on 31 March 1991. The ceasefire generally held after it took effect on 3 January at 18:00 hours. The main exception was in the Dubrovnik area, where the JNA held positions around the city of Dubrovnik and in nearby Konavle until July 1992. That area was not included <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> peacekeeping deployment schedule. On 4 January, the Yugoslav Navy retreated from the Lora naval base near Split. On 5 January, Major General Imra Agotić, commander of the ZNG, noted 84 ceasefire violations by the Serb side. On 7 January, the Yugoslav Air Force shot down a European Community Monitor Mission helicopter. The next day, Kadijević resigned as Minister of Defence and was replaced with Colonel General Blagoje Adžić.|$|E
5|$|By {{the morning}} of July 25 North Korean forces had {{infiltrated}} {{the positions of the}} 1st Cavalry Division so thoroughly that they were disrupting its lines of supply, and Gay ordered the division to withdrawal and re-form its lines further south. Northwest of Yongdong, 1st Battalion executed an orderly withdrawal, covered by the fire of the Heavy Mortar Company and the two batteries of the 77th Field Artillery Battalion. The mortar operators fought as infantry in the withdrawal. During these retreats North Korean troops disguised themselves as refugees and would form roadblocks <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> troops' rear areas, or used hidden communications equipment to inform higher commands of UN concentrations so those concentrations could be attacked when they were most vulnerable.|$|E

5|$|Despite the Geneva Accord {{requiring}} {{an immediate}} withdrawal of JNA personnel and equipment from Croatia, the JNA stayed behind {{for up to}} eight months in some areas. When its troops eventually pulled out, JNA left their equipment to the RSK. As a consequence of organisational problems and breaches of ceasefire, the UN peacekeepers, named the United Nations Protection Force (UNPROFOR), did not start to deploy until 8 March. The UNPROFOR took two months to fully assemble <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> Protected Areas (UNPAs). Furthermore, the RSK forces remained in areas outside designated UNPAs which were under RSK control {{at the time of}} the signing of the Implementation Agreement ceasefire of 3 January 1992. Those areas, later better known as the pink zones, were supposed to be restored to Croatian control from the outset of the plan implementation. Failure of this aspect of the implementation of the Vance plan made the pink zones a major source of contention for Croatia and the RSK.|$|E
5|$|Despite the {{warnings}} given by Brigadier General Paik Sun Yup, {{commander of the}} ROK 1st Infantry Division, a general feeling of optimism about {{the outcome of the}} war prevented {{the warnings}} from being taken seriously. With the fighting reached a stalemate at Unsan, General Walton Walker of the Eighth United States Army ordered the US 8th Cavalry Regiment of the US 1st Cavalry Division to resume offensives north by relieving the ROK 12th Regiment. By the time the US 8th Cavalry Regiment reached Unsan on 29 October, the ROK 11th Infantry Regiment of the ROK 1st Infantry Division was also pulling out of Unsan. At the same time, the Chinese had destroyed the ROK 6th Infantry Division on the east of Unsan. Unsan had now became a northern salient <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> line containing only the US 8th Cavalry Regiment and the ROK 15th Infantry Regiment.|$|E

5|$|International {{reaction}} to the Dutch actions was negative. Neighbouring Australia and newly independent India were particularly active in supporting the Republic's cause <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN,</b> as was the Soviet Union and, most significantly, the United States. Dutch ships continued to be boycotted from loading and unloading by Australian waterside workers, a blockade that began in September 1945. The United Nations Security Council became {{directly involved in the}} conflict, establishing a Good Offices Committee to sponsor further negotiations, making the Dutch diplomatic position particularly difficult. A ceasefire, called for by UNSC resolution 27, was ordered by the Dutch and Sukarno on 4 August 1947. During the military action, on 9 December 1947 Dutch troops killed many civilians in the village of Rawagede (now Balongsari in Karawang, West Java).|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1962 that Australia voted for a UN {{resolution}} condemning South Africa for its actions in South-West Africa, a change in policy led by External Affairs Minister Garfield Barwick. Initially in opposition, until he was Prime Minister Gough Whitlam was a vocal advocate of independence for Namibia. Over the following two decades, Australia played a small (but significant) role in supporting Namibian independence. Political leaders from both benches of Parliament, including Prime Ministers Whitlam and Malcolm Fraser, were active internationally in their support of independence for Namibia while in office. As a result, Australia was involved <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>UN</b> process almost from the start. In 1972 Australia voted in favour of a UN trust fund, {{and two years later}} it was elected to the UN Council for Namibia. Australia pledged support for UNTAG at the inception of the UN plan for Namibia with Resolution 435 in September 1978, and made an important contribution to UN deliberations about Namibia while a non-permanent member of the UN Security Council in 1985–1986.|$|E
