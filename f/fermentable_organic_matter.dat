This study investigates {{the effects of}} ensiling and fractionation on the estimated nutritive value of three grassland species harvested {{at different stages of}} maturity. Perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L., var. Gandalf), cocksfoot (Dactylis glomerata L., var. Pizza) and red clover (Trifolium pratense L., var. Merviot) were grown in field plots and harvested and ensiled in laboratory silos. These silages were subsequently fractionated into press-cake and press-juice fractions. Loss of soluble, <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> during ensiling increased the relative proportions of fibre and crude protein. Fractionation resulted in the substantial reduction of herbage soluble nutrient and mineral content, increasing the fibre content and reducing digestibility and crude protein.

These techniques were also evaluated for future and practical use in feed evaluation for ruminants. The techniques were compared using the digestion data of 98 forages and the energy values: in vivo total tract organic matter digestibility (OMD) and rumen <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (FOM), and the protein values: microbial nitrogen synthesised in the rumen (MNS) and rumen escape N (REN).

30|$|In {{the present}} study, the two {{different}} sugarcane genotypes had different chemical composition. The lignin and indigestible FDN contents were lower for the high-NDFD genotype, with greater DM and NDF digestibility (Sousa et al. 2014; Mesquita 2013). In the first study, the effect of greater NDF digestibility of sugarcane on F. succinogenes population was dependent on the method of conservation. F. succinogenes was increased with high-NDF digestibility, when sugarcane was offered as freshly cut. The R. albus population followed a similar pattern, although not significant (P =  0.12). The silage process alters the nutritional quality of roughages, where part of the NFC is consumed, and causing increase in the NDF and lignin concentration (Kung and Stanley 1982). Mode of conservation changed the chemical composition of sugarcane, with greater lignin and iNDF in the ensiled sugarcane, while DM and NDF digestibility were greater for the freshly-cut sugarcane. Therefore, when sugarcane is offered as freshly cut there is more soluble sugar arriving in the rumen environment. Consequently, mode of conservation influenced rumen pH, with greater rumen pH when sugarcane was offered as silage than as freshly cut (6.69 vs. 6.37  ±  0.08; P <  0.01). There was no effect of sugarcane genotype on rumen pH levels (Sousa et al. 2014). According to Tafaj et al. (2005), a moderate quantity of NFC in the diet can stimulate fiber digestibility because of better supply of <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> nitrogen, and energy for the ruminal bacteria.|$|E

40|$|Ferrihydrite is a {{widespread}} poorly crystalline Fe oxide which becomes easily coated by natural <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in the environment. This mineral-bound <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> entirely changes the mineral surface properties and therefore the reactivity of the original mineral. Here, we investigated 2 -line ferrihydrite, ferrihydrite with adsorbed <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> and ferrihydrite coprecipitated with <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> for microbial and abiotic reduction of Fe(III). Ferrihydrite-organic matter associations with different <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> loadings were reduced either by Geobacter bremensis or abiotically by Na-dithionite. Both types of experiments showed decreasing initial Fe-reduction rates and decreasing degrees of reduction with increasing amounts of mineral-bound <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> At similar <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> loadings, coprecipitated ferrihydrites were more reactive than ferrihydrites with adsorbed <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The difference {{can be explained by}} the smaller crystal size and poor crystallinity of such coprecipitates. At small <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> loadings the poor crystallinity of coprecipitates led to even faster Fe-reduction rates than found for pure ferrihydrite. The amount of mineral-bound <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> also affected the formation of secondary minerals: goethite was only found after reduction of organic matter-free ferrihydrite and siderite was only detected when ferrihydrites with relatively low amounts of mineral-bound <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> were reduced.

(treatment 1), rhodes grass hay was supplemented with 200 g/d oven-dried leucaena (treatment 2), rhodes grass hay was supplemented with 200 g/d leucaena plus 8 g/d urea (treatment 3) and rhodes grass hay was suplemented with 200 g/d leucaena plus 150 g/d sucrose (treatment 4). This experiment used a latin square design and variables measured were dry matter, organic matter intake and digestibilities of OM, NDF and N by the method of total collection, N balance, ruminal parameters such as rumen pH and ammonia, and rumen microbial protein synthesis.

We aimed at building an empirical model describing production rates (PR) of individual VFA in the rumen. Three distinct bibliographic data bases were used. They gathered published in vivo measurements on ruminal VFA-PR, digestive fluxes and molar proportion of VFA in the rumen, and net portal fluxes of VFA. These data bases cover {{a wide range of}} intake levels and dietary composition. A meta-analysis was performed, using within-experiment models. Models were derived, describing total VFA-PR and individual VFA molar proportions in the rumen from variation in dry matter intake level and dietary composition. The VFA-PR was explained by intake of rumen <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (RfOM), calculated from detailed knowledge of the chemical composition of diets according to INRA Feed Tables, with the effect of other factors remaining non significant. The VFA molar proportions were explained by dry matter intake, digestible organic matter, digestible neutral detergent fibre and rumen starch digestibility. Based on these results, we proposed an empirical model to predict individual VFA-PR from simple predictors which represent the nature of digested substrates, as well as their site and extent of digestion. The model can be used under a wide range of levels of feed intake and dietary composition. Evaluation of predicted VFA-PR indicated close relationships with observed net portal appearance of VFA.

Organic matter truly digested in the rumen — which in our study was regarded as equivalent to in vivo FOM — was determined in six cannulated sheep, using the flow markers 51 Cr-EDTA and 103 Ru-Phenan-throlin. In vivo FOM was estimated directly from results of the in situ nylon bag technique using three cows, and {{from the results of}} three in vitro methods, and indirectly by calculating in vivo FOM using equations from the Dutch and French protein evaluation systems. The in vitro methods were an enzymatic technique using pepsin and cellulase, the method of Tilley & Terry and the gas production technique. In vivo FOM was best correlated (R 2 = 0. 74; n = 12) with gas production after 20 hours of incubation. The correlation improved when fresh and conserved forages were considered separately (R 2 = 0. 90; n = 12).

40|$|Although {{livestock}} production {{accounts for a}} sizeable share of global greenhouse gas emissions, numerous technical options have been identified to mitigate these emissions. In this review, a subset of these options, which {{have proven to be}} effective, are discussed. These include measures to reduce CH 4 emissions from enteric fermentation by ruminants, the largest single emission source from the global livestock sector, and for reducing CH 4 and N 2 O emissions from manure. A unique feature of this review is the high level of attention given to interactions between mitigation options and productivity. Among the feed supplement options for lowering enteric emissions, dietary lipids, nitrates and ionophores are identified as the most effective. Forage quality, feed processing and precision feeding have the best prospects among the various available feed and feed management measures. With regard to manure, dietary measures that reduce the amount of N excreted (e. g. better matching of dietary protein to animal needs), shift N excretion from urine to faeces (e. g. tannin inclusion at low levels) and reduce the amount of <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> excreted are recommended. Among the many ‘end-of-pipe’ measures available for manure management, approaches that capture and/or process CH 4 emissions during storage (e. g. anaerobic digestion, biofiltration, composting), as well as subsurface injection of manure, are among the most encouraging options flagged in this section of the review. The importance of a multiple gas perspective is critical when assessing mitigation potentials, because most of the options reviewed show strong interactions among sources of greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

The transformation of the in situ rate of degradation (kd) to its half-life value of degradation ((ln 2 /kd) 100) provided an improvement of kd prediction in the Sigmoidal model, with R 2 changing from 0. 35 to 0. 64.

Soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> is a natural reservoir for nutrients, buffers against soil erosion, and improves the soil environment to sustain soil productivity. Maintaining soil productivity requires an agriculture management system that maintains or improves soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content. Combining cropping systems and conservation tillage practices, such as no-tillage, strip-tillage, or ridge-tillage, are proven to be very effective in improving soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and soil quality...|$|R
40|$|The {{purpose of}} this {{experiment}} is to make clear the relationship between an accumulation of soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> becoming decomposable due to drying of soil and microbial cells. The results are summarized as follows : 1) The accumulation of soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> becoming decomposable due to drying occurred in the decomposition process of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> applied to soil, and its quantity clearly increased with an increase of microbial cells. Further, the accumulation increased in company with an increase of reimmobilization during the decomposition process of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> applied to soil. 2) The accumulation of the decomposable soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> was clearly recognized during the decomposition process of microbial cells in soil. The accumulation rate was higher in newly immobilized <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> of soil than in native soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> 3) It was suggested that microbial cells and their cell walls considerably contribute {{as a source of}} the decomposable soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter...</b>|$|R
40|$|The {{importance}} of soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in supplying nutrients, contributing to cation exchange capacity, and improving soil structure, is well recognized. In some states, the <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> {{content of the}} soil is used to adjust N, S, herbicide, and/or lime recommendations. The {{importance of}} soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in herbicide recommendations has rekindled an interest in <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> analysis. Soil <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content is also useful in developing management plans for land application of municipal sewage sludges and other wastes. <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> determinations are usually based on one of two methods: 1.

40|$|The {{metabolic}} {{response of}} dairy cows to high {{as opposed to}} low altitude conditions (2000 m v. 400 m above sea level) was determined. In the first experiment, four cows were subjected {{to a series of}} measurements before, during and after transport from lowland to high altitude pasture. During transport, cortisol, l-lactate and non-esterified fatty acids were significantly elevated but decreased within 1 to 3 days to initial levels. After transport, β-hydroxybutyrate and the thyroid hormones immediately increased and returned within 3 weeks to initial levels. Plasma urea increased during transport and subsequently was at an intermediate level due to the different diet. There were no direct carry-over effects of transport on metabolic traits during pasturing. In the second experiment, three groups of six different dairy cows were either grazed in one of two consecutive years or kept inside (2 nd year only). Lowland sojourn lasted for 4 weeks, and high altitude period for 8 weeks. At the end of high altitude sojourn, both outside and inside groups were found still to have significantly higher plasma cortisol values than at lowland. Thyroid hormones and ketosis related metabolites sharply increased {{at the start of the}} alpine period and were elevated for 1 to 3 weeks thereafter. According to the hormonal and metabolic profiles, the permanently housed cows did not benefit from the less adverse climatic conditions and the lower physical strain. Plasma urea closely reflected dietary changes in the ratio of nitrogen to <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Plasma protein, albumin, creatinine, and liver enzyme activities were not affected by transport or high altitude sojourn in both experiments. The results indicate that the metabolic response to transport and high altitude conditions can be mostly explained by the efforts to cover the additional energy requirements. Overall the data suggest a wide but nevertheless limited ability of early-lactating cows to adapt to high altitude condition...|$|E
40|$|Despite {{their major}} {{contribution}} to the energy supply of ruminants, the production of volatile fatty acids (VFA) in the rumen is still poorly predicted by rumen models. We have developed an empirical approach, based on the interpretation of large bibliographic databases gathering published in vivo measurements of ruminal VFA production rate (PR), rates of duodenal and faecal digestion and molar percentages of VFA in the rumen. These databases, covering {{a wide range of}} intake levels and dietary composition, were studied by meta-analysis using within-experiment models. We established models to quantify response laws of total VFA-PR and individual VFA molar percentages in the rumen to variations in intake level and dietary composition. The rumen <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> (RfOM) intake, estimated from detailed knowledge of the chemical composition of diets according to INRA Feed Tables, appears as an accurate explanatory variable of measured total VFA-PR, with an average increment of 8. 0360. 64 mol total VFA/kg RfOM intake. Similar results were obtained when total VFA-PR was estimated from measured apparent RfOM (total VFA-PR/RfOM averaging 8. 361. 2 mol/kg). The VFA molar percentages were related to dry matter intake and measured digestible organic matter (OM), digestible NDF and rumen starch digestibility, with root mean square error of 1. 23, 1. 45, 0. 88 and 0. 41 mol/ 100 mol total VFA for acetate, propionate, butyrate and minor VFA, respectively, with no effect of pH on the residuals. Stoichiometry coefficients were calculated from the slopes of the relationships between individual VFA production (estimated from measured apparent RfOM and individual VFA molar percentages) and measured fermented fractions. Coefficients averaged, respectively, 66, 17, 14 and 3 mol/ 100 mol for NDF; 41, 44, 12 and 4 mol/ 100 mol for starch; and 46, 35, 13 and 6 mol/ 100 mol for crude protein. Their use to predict VFA molar percentages appear relevant for most dietary conditions, that is, when the digested NDF/digested OM ratio exceeded 0. 12. This study provides a quantitative review on VFA yield in the rumen. It contributes to the development of feed evaluation systems based on nutrient fluxes...|$|E
40|$|Changes in rumen {{microbiota}} and in situ {{degradation kinetics}} were studied in 12 rumen-cannulated Holstein Friesian dairy cows {{during the dry}} period and early lactation. The effect of a rapid (RAP) or gradual (GRAD) postpartum (pp) rate of increase of concentrate allowance was also investigated. Cows were fed for ad libitum intake and had free access to a mixed ration consisting of chopped wheat straw (dry period only), grass silage, corn silage, and soybean meal. Treatment consisted of either a rapid (1. 0 kg of dry matter/d; n = 6) or gradual (0. 25 kg of dry matter/d; n = 6) increase of concentrate allowance (up to 10. 9 kg of dry matter/d), starting at 4 d pp. In whole rumen contents, bacterial community composition was assessed using samples from 50, 30, and 10 d antepartum (ap), and 3, 9, 16, 30, 44, 60, and 80 d pp, and protozoal and archaeal community composition using samples from 10 d ap, and 16 and 44 d pp. Intake of <b>fermentable</b> <b>organic</b> <b>matter,</b> starch, and sugar was temporarily greater in RAP than GRAD at 16 d pp. Bacterial community richness was higher during the dry period than during the lactation. A rapid increase in concentrate allowance decreased bacterial community richness at 9 and 16 d pp compared with a gradual increase in concentrate allowance, whereas from 30 d pp onward richness of RAP and GRAD was similar. In general, the relative abundances of Bacteroidales and Aeromonadales were greater, and those of Clostridiales, Fibrobacterales, and Spirochaetales were smaller, during the lactation compared with the dry period. An interaction between treatment and sampling day was observed for some bacterial community members, {{and most of the}} protozoal and archaeal community members. Transition to lactation increased the relative abundance of Epidinium and Entodinium, but reduced the relative abundance of Ostracodinium. Archaea from genus Methanobrevibacter dominated during both the dry period and lactation. However, during lactation the abundance of the methylotrophic Methanomassiliicoccaceae and Methanosphaera increased. The in situ degradation of organic matter, neutral detergent fiber, starch, and crude protein was neither affected by treatment nor by transition from the dry period to lactation. Results show that the composition of the rumen microbiota can change quickly from the dry period to the lactation period, in particular with a rapid increase in fermentable substrate supply postpartum, but this was not associated with changes in rumen degradation kinetics...|$|E
40|$|Soils are {{composed}} of mineral and <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Weathered rocks provide soil minerals, while <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> forms from decayed animal and plant residues. An important component of healthy soil, <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> helps maintain and improve soil’s physical condition.

40|$|This study {{demonstrates}} that intracrystalline <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in coral skeletons is well preserved over century timescales. The extent of preservation of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in coral skeletons was investigated by measuring {{total organic carbon}} (TOC), total hydrolyzable amino acid (THAA), chloropigment, and lipid concentrations in 0 - 300 year old annual growth bands from Montastraea annularis (Florida Keys) and Porites lutea (Red Sea). <b>Organic</b> <b>matter</b> intrinsic to the calcium carbonate mineral (intracrystalline) was analyzed separately from total skeletal <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> The Red Sea coral had less TOC (0. 02 - 0. 04 wt%) than the Florida Keys coral (0. 04 - 0. 11 wt%), but a higher percent of intracrystalline <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> in all annual bands measured. Carbon {{in the form of}} THAA, most likely from mineral-precipitating proteins, contributed 30 - 45 % of the TOC in both corals. Carbon in lipids represented about 3 % of the TOC in the coral skeletons. Chlorophyll-a and b were present in annual bands where endolithic algae were present, but these compounds were minor contributors to TOC. The distribution of specific organic compounds showed that <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> was well preserved throughout the time period sampled in both the total and intracrystalline pools. Variations in THAA were not correlated with TOC over time, suggesting that <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> that is involved in biomineralization, like amino acids, may be deposited in response to different environmental factors than are other components of skeletal <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> Differences in the quantity and composition of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> between the two corals investigated here were assessed using principal components analysis and suggest that location, species and skeletal structure may all influence <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> content and possibly the degree of physical protection of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> by the coral skeleton. Further, our study suggests that intracrystalline <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> may be better protected from diagenesis than non-intracrystalline <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> and may therefore be a more reliable source of <b>organic</b> <b>matter</b> for paleoceanographic studies than total skeletal <b>organic</b> <b>matter.</b> © 2003 Elsevier Science Ltd...|$|R
