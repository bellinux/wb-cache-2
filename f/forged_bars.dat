40|$|M. Ing. Grade 4 {{titanium}} is {{a commercially}} pure grade titanium alloy extensively used in various industries including {{the chemical industry}} and more recently in the biomedical industry. Grade 4 has found a niche as a biomedical material for production of components such as orthopaedic and dental implants. Its physical properties such as high corrosion resistance, low thermal conductivity and high strength make it suitable for these applications. These properties also make it hard-to-machine similar to the other grades of titanium alloys and other metals such as nickel based alloys. During machining of titanium, elevated temperatures are generated at the tool-workpiece interface due to its low thermal conductivity. Its high strength is also maintained at these high temperatures. These tend to impair the cutting tool affecting its machinability. Various investigations on other grades of titanium and other hard-to-machine materials have shown that machining at high cutting speeds may improve certain aspects of their machinability. High speed machining (HSM) is used to improve productivity in the machining process and to therefore lower manufacturing costs. HSM may, however, change the surface integrity of the machined material. Surface integrity refers to {{the properties of the}} surface and sub-surface of a machined component which may be quite different from the substrate. The properties of the surface and sub-surface of a component may have a marked effect on the functional behaviour of a machined component. Fatigue life and wear are examples of properties that may be significantly influenced by a change in the surface integrity. Surface integrity may include the topography, the metallurgy and various other mechanical properties. It is evaluated by examination of surface integrity indicators. In this investigation the three main surface integrity indicators are examined. These are surface roughness, sub-surface hardness and residual stress. White layer thickness and chip morphology were also observed as results of the machining process used. The effect of HSM on the surface integrity of grade 4 is largely unknown. This investigation therefore aims to address this limitation by conducting an experimental investigation on the effect of HSM on selected surface integrity indicators for grade 4. Two <b>forged</b> <b>bars</b> of grade 4 alloy were machined using a CNC lathe at two depths of cut, 0. 2 mm and 1 mm. Each bar was machined at varying cutting speeds ranging from 70 m/min to 290 m/min at intervals of approximately 20 m/min. Machined samples were prepared from these cutting speeds and depths of cut. The three surface integrity indicators were then evaluated with respect to the cutting speed and depth of cut (DoC). iv Results show that a combination of intermediate cutting speeds and low DoC may have desirable effects on the surface integrity of grade 4. Highest compressive stresses were obtained when machining with these conditions. High compressive stresses are favourable in cases where the fatigue life of a material {{is an important factor in}} the functionality of a component. Subsurface hardening was noticed at 0. 2 mm DoC, with no subsurface softening at all cutting speeds. Surface hardness higher than the bulk hardness tends to improve the wear resistance of the machined material. Though surface roughness values for all depths of cut were below the standard fine finish of 1. 6 μm, roughness values of samples machined at 0. 2 mm DoC continued to decrease with increase in cutting speed. Low surface roughness values may also influence the improvement of fatigue life of the machined components. These machining conditions, (intermediate cutting speeds and low DoC), seem to have promoted mechanically dominated deformation during machining rather than thermal dominated deformation. Thermal dominated deformation was prominent on titanium machined at DoC of 1 mm...|$|E

40|$|Abstract: Grade 5 {{titanium}} alloy (Ti 6 Al 4 V) is the workhorse {{titanium alloy}} {{used in many}} industrial applications including aerospace, automotive, chemical and biomedical. Its attractive mechanical properties such as high strength-to-weight ratio, low density and corrosion resistance make it eminently suitable for such applications. However, its use is limited to these specialized applications due to its high cost. This high cost is mainly due to the primary processing of the material using the Kroll process. Little can be done, currently, to reduce the primary processing cost due to the high reactivity of titanium with oxygen. However, cost reduction measures can be implemented during secondary processing to make this alloy more affordable for general engineering applications. Such measures may include powder metallurgy, laser additive manufacturing, high performance machining and high speed machining. High speed machining (HSM) {{has been used to}} improve productivity and reduce component manufacturing costs in aerospace applications such as wing sections. HSM involves machining at high cutting speeds. Such high speed cutting can be implemented under milling or turning conditions. In this investigation, high speed cutting using turning was investigated. However, high speed machining has an effect on the surface and sub-surface condition of a machined component. This may affect the service performance of a component, especially fatigue life. Surface integrity descriptors that may be influenced by machining, and which may affect component fatigue life include surface roughness, micro hardness, microstructure and residual stresses. The cumulative effect of HSM on the fatigue behavior and life of components is largely unknown. This work aims to redress this by conducting experimental investigations supported by numerical analysis, on the effect of HSM on the fatigue performance of turned components for finish cutting conditions of Ti 6 Al 4 V.

The testing {{was carried out in}} cortest proof rings on three test specimens pre-charged with hydrogen and one reference specimen without hydrogen until fracture occurred.

The possibility of secondary cracking was also investigated using the SEM. In addition, the microstructures were examined using optical microscopy (OM) and assessed compared to the HISC testing results. The austenite spacing was also measured. The hydrogen measurements together with the presence of secondary cracking of all test materials confirmed HISC being the fracture mechanism. The test results indicated that all SDSS materials tested are susceptible to HISC, and that the hot extruded material with no cold deformation has a higher HISC resistance while centrifugally cast materials are more prone to HISC than the other production methods. The fracture surfaces of all hydrogen charged test materials showed features indicating a reduction in ductility due to HISC as well as both ductile and brittle fracture characteristics across the surfaces. The placement of the ductile and brittle features varied, and both could be found close to the centre and edges of the fracture surfaces. The fracture surfaces for the reference specimens showed mostly ductile fracture characteristics. The results from the HISC testing were discussed compared to available literature on the subject of HISC in SDSS, and the susceptibility of the materials from the different materials towards HISC were ranked from lowest to highest based on the overall test performance and measurements conducted.

The effects of Cr and Mo contents with respect to tempering resistance and the Al addition on the nitriding response have been evaluated. From <b>forged</b> steel <b>bars,</b> Charpy impact test and characterization via EPMA have been conducted. The proposed contents of Cr, Mo, and Al have attributed to the new VEX grade a much better tempering resistance than H 13, as well as a deeper and harder nitrided layer. Due to the unique characteristics, this new steel provides an interesting alternative to the aluminum extrusion companies to increase their competitiveness...|$|R
