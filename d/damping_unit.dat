40|$|This final {{thesis is}} carried out at BAE Systems Hägglunds in Örnsköldsvik. The mission was to {{construct}} and integrate a new semi-active <b>damping</b> <b>unit</b> in the terrain vehicle BvS 10. Questions that came up during the process, among others, was how to mount the <b>damping</b> <b>unit</b> to the vehicle in a flexible way without exposing it to unnecessary wears. A generation of the concept is made in 3 D using CATIA V 5 of a possible solution to the problem. The idea is to weld the unit to the skid girder {{which is one of}} the main constructions of the track system. In this way the <b>damping</b> <b>unit</b> will come closer to the track system, which will partly protect it from impacts from below and minimize current problems with breaking forces in the torsion shafts. The complete construction was then analyzed, first by theoretical calculations and then with the FEM-tools in CATIA V 5. The result of this analysis showed that the construction had a good potential to resist deformation and high tensions. Drawings in 2 D of the assemblies were then generated for the left and right damping units separately...|$|E

30|$|However, {{in order}} to keep the {{required}} sampling time for the averaging short, the probe is equipped with a damping mechanism. Figure  3 b shows the essential parts of the eddy current <b>damping</b> <b>unit.</b> A pair of small cylindrical permanent magnets provides a magnetic field that penetrates a thin copper sheet attached to the back side of the target holder. The target together with the copper sheet oscillates perpendicularly to the field lines, so that eddy currents are generated in the sheet. The currents create a counteracting force (Lenz’s law) and dissipate energy stemming from the oscillation. Figure  3 a shows the x-y plot of the measured displacements for the damped case (blue curve), too. Now, the oscillations are significantly reduced in both directions. The natural frequency f 0 disappeared completely from the spectra shown in Fig.  3 d, which indicates the efficient damping of the cantilever vibrations. In contrast, the amplitudes at other frequencies persist; the remaining frequencies can be understood as the complicated modes of the entire setup that result not only in vibrations of the lenses but also of the <b>damping</b> <b>unit,</b> which are unintentionally transmitted to the target via the eddy currents. We determined the time constants τ for the exponentially decaying amplitudes, i.e. decaying proportionally to exp(−t/τ) with the time t. To this end, we knocked carefully on the target with a thin wire and recorded the oscillations. We found τ=(6.0 ± 0.5) s without eddy current damping, and τ′=(0.3 ± 0.1) s with the <b>damping</b> <b>unit.</b> The resulting quality factor Q = 1 / 2 ω _ 0 τ for the cantilever as an oscillating system becomes Q= 209 ± 18 without additional damping and Q′= 10.5 ± 3.5 for the intentionally damped system. This means that the damped cantilever looses its oscillation energy after only a few (≈Q′ / 2 π) oscillations, but it is still underdamped (Q′> 1 / 2), i.e. abrupt displacements cause an overshooting. Inthe “Example of a vectorial force measurement” section, a measurement without damping will be shown in comparison with a corresponding measurement with the damping system.|$|E

3000|$|There is {{a simple}} way how a {{changing}} “spring constant” k could be monitored without additional temperature sensors, which obviously should not {{be attached to the}} cantilever. However, this technique works only when the <b>damping</b> <b>unit</b> is not used, because it relies on an evaluation of small shifts of the natural frequency f 0. For an ideal beam with one free end and no additional masses attached to it, the square of the natural frequency f 0 is proportional to Young’s modulus E, i.e. f_ 0 ^ 2 ∝ E. One can easily reason that this holds for the geometrically more complicated force probe cantilever as well, since the elastic modulus E still enters linearly in all the forces that move the cantilever. Hence, an increase of E by a factor of λ makes the motion by the factor λ 2 faster (time scales proportionally to λ− 2), i.e. frequencies of oscillations would increase by the factor λ 2. This is confirmed by the above mentioned theoretical modal analysis in the Appendix, in particlular Eq. (8), which results in a decrease from 10.6 Hz to 10.5 Hz for the first mode, when the temperature rises by ΔT=+ 100 K from room temperature. A by 1 [...]...|$|E
