Methods: <b>Medical</b> <b>reasons</b> for not participating in breast and bowel screening were defined a priori {{on the basis of}} a literature review and expert opinion.

This special study seeks to compare the experience of children that enrolled in Healthy Kids for a <b>medical</b> <b>reason</b> with the general Healthy Kids population, those who enrolled without indicating a current health care need. The client survey was conducted in two waves (baseline and follow-up) among 474 children ages 12 – 72 months with a response rate of 86 percent. Children were included in the “enrolled for a medical reason” category if they enrolled because the child was sick or needed medical care, needed a prescription medicine that the family could not afford or if their parent gave a <b>medical</b> <b>reason</b> in response to the following question: “Was there any other important reason that the child was enrolled in Healthy Kids? ” A two sided t-test was used to compare responses at baseline and follow-up for children who did and who did not enroll for a <b>medical</b> <b>reason.</b> Children enrolling for a <b>medical</b> <b>reason</b> reported a range of common conditions includin...|$|R
