500|$|Attorneys {{with the}} office of the Texas Attorney General took on Mitchell's case after being {{contacted}} by the TMB. Assistant Attorney General David Glickler later said that the case was the most bizarre he had seen in an 11-year stint {{with the office}}. [...] "We're used to dealing with cases where public officials have enriched themselves {{at the expense of the}} office and the public trust, like bribery and theft. But there was no financial benefit to the bad actors in this case." [...] The jury returned with a not guilty verdict after an hour of deliberation. Those present in the courtroom said that each juror approached Mitchell after the verdict and <b>hugged</b> <b>her.</b> In comments he made after the trial, jury foreman Harley Tyler said he wondered why the nurses were arrested. ANA president Rebecca Patton said that the verdict was [...] "a resounding win on behalf of patient safety." ...|$|E
500|$|On Good Friday in March 2005, Veitch, Albee and {{six other}} women went to a strip club in Riverside and paid for lap dances. Instead of {{accepting}} the dances, they talked with the strippers, telling {{them that they were}} loved and accepted by God, that churches were composed entirely of sinners, and that they would be welcome there. One of the lap dancers cried and told Albee she had often wanted to go to a church but had never done so because she had thought that she would be rejected. The woman accepted a prayer from Albee and <b>hugged</b> <b>her.</b> Albee would later say that talking with women at the strip club that first day changed her life. Because the volunteers received more positive responses than they had expected, they decided to continue to evangelize at strip clubs. To organize these activities, Veitch and Albee founded JC's Girls, with [...] "JC" [...] standing for Jesus Christ. They made Matthew's House the parent organization, but decided to operate primarily under the name [...] "JC's Girls" [...] because Veitch believed that strippers would not understand the meaning of the name [...] "Matthew's House".|$|E
500|$|Following Beyoncé's performance, American {{journalist}} Anderson Cooper who {{was present}} at the Hall and served as a host jokingly asked the crowd, [...] "Is this what happens at the U.N. every Friday night? Because, I've gotta tell you ... I wanna be here every Friday night if this goes on." [...] Diane Warren described the performance as [...] "one of the best experiences ever" [...] in her life. The performance and the music video received positive reviews from critics, who praised Beyoncé's live vocals. Pamela Falk of CBS News described the performance as [...] "breathtaking" [...] and [...] "stunning". Jim Farber of Daily News was also positive about the performance saying that she [...] "delivered a powerful live vocal to the song's musical track". Molly O'Brien of Prefix Magazine commented that the video was [...] "simple and powerful: Beyoncé gives an impeccable live performance of the song... On the album, 'I Was Here' is pompous and a little cloying; live and accompanied by those images, it's got the same change-the-world flavor as Michael Jackson's 'Man in the Mirror.'" [...] Nadeska Alexis of the same publication wrote that Beyoncé belted out her vocals while members of the audience sang along further noting that the moment ended [...] "all too quickly". A writer of OK! magazine praised Beyoncé for being [...] "striking as always" [...] while belting out [...] "I Was Here" [...] in the video. MTV Act's Jose Iniguez described the performance as [...] "phenomenal, flawless, goosebump-inducing, inspiring" [...] adding that it gave him life and made him feel [...] "gobbled up" [...] by the presence of Beyoncé. He added that [...] "I Was Here" [...] couldn't have been a better fit for the campaign and concluded that [...] "Bey was simply flawless. Her voice, her dress, her touching (yet short) address after her performance sent chills down very limb." [...] Mike Larkin from the Daily Mail described the performance as [...] "spectacular" [...] while praising the [...] "virtual galaxy" [...] created on the stage with [...] "lavish" [...] production values, Beyoncé's [...] "spine-tingling" [...] vocal rendition while hitting the high notes and her [...] "fantastic" [...] look complete with [...] "dazzlingly glamorous white frock, which <b>hugged</b> <b>her</b> spectacular post pregnancy body in all the right places".|$|E

2500|$|Garfield's {{world has}} {{specific}} locations that appear normally on the comic strips, like the Vet's office, {{a place he}} loathes. Irma's Diner is another occasional setting. Irma is a chirpy but slow-witted and unattractive waitress/manager, and one of Jon's few friends. The terrible food {{is the center of}} most of the jokes, along with the poor management. Jon periodically visits his parents and brother on the farm. This results in week-long comical displays of stupidity by Jon and his family, and their interactions. There is a comic strip where Jon's brother Doc Boy is watching two socks in the dryer spinning and Doc Boy calls it entertainment. On the farm, Jon's mother will cook huge dinners; Garfield hugs her for this. Jon has a grandmother who, in a strip, kicked Odie; Garfield subsequently <b>hugged</b> <b>her.</b> Jon's parents have twice visited Jon, Garfield, and Odie in the city. Jon's father drove into town on his tractor (which he double-parked) and brought a rooster to wake him up. As Garfield has a love for food, they will often eat out at restaurants. Most trips end up embarrassing because Garfield will pig out, or Jon will do something stupid, including wearing an ugly shirt, which happened one night when he took Liz on a date. When Jon does take Liz on a date, Garfield occasionally tags along---once, he ate the bread and other food at an Italian restaurant they went to. Frequently, the characters break the fourth wall, mostly to explain something to the readers, talk about a subject that often sets up the strip's punchline (like Jon claiming that pets are good for exercise right before he finds Garfield in the kitchen and chases him out), or give a mere glare when a character is belittled or not impressed. Sometimes, this theme revolves around the conventions of the strip; for example, in one strip, Garfield catches a cold and complains about it, noting, [...] "I can hardy eben understad by own thoughts." ...|$|E
