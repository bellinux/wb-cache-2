40|$|AbstractThe phase {{behavior}} of membrane lipids {{is known to}} influence the organization and function of many integral proteins. Giant unilamellar vesicles (GUVs) provide a very useful model system in which to examine the details of lipid phase separation using fluorescence imaging. The visualization of domains in GUVs of binary and ternary lipid mixtures requires <b>fluorescent</b> <b>probes</b> with partitioning preference {{for one of the}} phases present. To avoid possible pitfalls when interpreting the phase {{behavior of}} these lipid mixtures, sufficiently thorough characterization of the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>probes</b> used in these studies is needed. It is now evident that <b>fluorescent</b> <b>probes</b> display different partitioning preferences between lipid phases, depending on the specific lipid host system. Here, we demonstrate the benefit of using a panel of <b>fluorescent</b> <b>probes</b> and confocal fluorescence microscopy to examine phase separation in GUVs of binary mixtures of 1, 2 -dioleoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DOPC) / 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphocholine (DPPC). Patch and fibril gel phase domains were found to co-exist with liquid disordered (ld) domains on the surface of GUVs composed of 40 : 60 mol% DOPC/DPPC, over a wide range of temperatures (14 – 25 °C). The fluorescent lipid, 1, 2 -dipalmitoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine-N-(7 -nitro- 2 - 1, 3 -benzoxadiazol- 4 -yl (NBD-DPPE), proved to be the most effective probe for visualization of fibril domains. In the presence of LissamineTM rhodamine B 1, 2 -dihexadecanoyl-sn-glycero- 3 -phosphoethanolamine (Rh-DPPE) we were unable to detect fibril domains. This fluorophore also affected the partitioning behavior of other <b>fluorescent</b> <b>probes.</b> Overall, we show that the selection of different <b>fluorescent</b> <b>probes</b> as lipid phase reporters can result in very different interpretation of the phase behavior of DOPC/DPPC mixtures...|$|R

The {{intensity of}} the fluorescence increases as the PCR products accumulate. This technique is easy to use since designing of probes is not necessary given lack of specificity of its binding. However, since the dye does not discriminate the double-stranded DNA from the PCR products and those from the primer-dimers, overestimation of the target concentration is a common problem. Where accurate quantification is an absolute necessity, further assay for the validation of results must be performed. Nevertheless, amongst the real-time RT-PCR product detection methods, SYBR Green is the most economical and easiest to use. TaqMan Probes: [...] TaqMan probes are oligonucleotides that have a <b>fluorescent</b> <b>probe</b> attached to the 5' end and a quencher to the 3' end. During PCR amplification, these probes will hybridize to the target sequences located in the amplicon and as polymerase replicates the template with TaqMan bound, it also cleaves the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>probe</b> due to polymerase 5'- nuclease activity. Because the close proximity between the quench molecule and the <b>fluorescent</b> <b>probe</b> normally prevents fluorescence from being detected through FRET, the decoupling results in the increase of intensity of fluorescence proportional {{to the number of}} the probe cleavage cycles. Although well-designed TaqMan probes produce accurate real-time RT-PCR results, it is expensive and time-consuming to synthesize when separate probes must be made for each mRNA target analyzed.|$|E
