5|$|Cork is {{produced}} from the thick bark of the cork oak (Quercus suber). It is harvested {{from the living}} trees about once every ten years in an environmentally sustainable industry. More than half the world's cork comes from Portugal and is largely used to make stoppers for wine bottles. Other uses include <b>floor</b> <b>tiles,</b> bulletin boards, balls, footwear, cigarette tips, packaging, insulation and joints in woodwind instruments.|$|E

5|$|A second church, also {{dedicated}} to St Michael, was built of local sandstone in the 14th century by the Abbot Adam of Sodbury, incorporating {{the foundations of}} the previous building. It included stained glass and decorated <b>floor</b> <b>tiles.</b> There was also a portable altar of Purbeck Marble; {{it is likely that the}} Monastery of St Michael on the Tor was a daughter house of Glastonbury Abbey. In 1243 Henry III granted a charter for a six-day fair at the site.|$|E
5|$|An early {{structural}} {{application of}} the Pythagorean tiling appears {{in the works of}} Leonardo da Vinci, who considered it among several other potential patterns for floor joists. This tiling has also long been used decoratively, for <b>floor</b> <b>tiles</b> or other similar patterns, as can be seen for instance in Jacob Ochtervelt's painting Street Musicians at the Doorway of a House (1665). It has been suggested that seeing a similar tiling in the palace of Polycrates may have provided Pythagoras with the original inspiration for his theorem.|$|E

The year of completion {{and the name of}} the German city in which the donors for that building lived were engraved on each building façade.

5|$|Furniture {{during the}} Baroque era was {{in keeping with}} the style: ornate, gilded and {{frequently}} with marble used for tabletops. The furniture was transient within the house, frequently moved between rooms as required, while leaving other rooms unfurnished. Sometimes furniture was specifically commissioned for a certain room, for example to match a silk wall panel within a gilt frame. As in the rest of Europe, the furniture would always be left arranged against a wall, to be moved forward by servants if required, never in the later conversational style in the centre of a room, which in the Baroque era was always left empty so as better to display the marble, or more often ceramic, patterned <b>floor</b> <b>tiles.</b>|$|E
5|$|Constructed by the Ruthvens {{after they}} {{acquired}} the castle around 1515, the Ruthven Lodging represents {{the final stage}} of building at Dirleton. In the later part of the 16th century, it served as the main residence of Lady Dorothea, wife of the first Earl of Gowrie, and their 15 children. The three-storey building is constructed, like the Haliburton range, from undressed stone, although the Ruthven Lodging is decorated with string courses, horizontal mouldings running around the walls. The large windows were protected by iron grilles and small gun holes. The rectangular Lodging is immediately {{to the north of the}} de Vaux building, separated by a narrow irregular courtyard, which is accessed via a passage in the ground floor of the Lodging. The remainder of the ground floor was occupied by cellars, with family rooms and bedrooms on the upper floors. The first-floor dining room was paved with patterned <b>floor</b> <b>tiles,</b> and may once have had a painted timber ceiling.|$|E

5|$|In 1538 the Abbey {{with all}} land and {{possessions}} was surrendered by the monks to Henry VIII {{in the course}} of the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The main buildings of the abbey were then demolished, although some of the decorative <b>floor</b> <b>tiles</b> were relaid in the neighbouring Church of St Peter and St Paul. The whole property and advowson was then granted to Edward Seymour, Earl of Hertford, later 1st Duke of Somerset. On his execution in 1552 it reverted to The Crown. Stone from the abbey was used in many of the local buildings. In 1872 when collecting stone labourers found a blue stone coffin lid under which the pavement of the 14th century lady chapel was uncovered. In 1924 a pageant was held at the site, involving around 500 people, representing the history of the abbey from its foundation to the dissolution.|$|E
5|$|Shin Megami Tensei: Strange Journey is a {{role-playing}} game {{in which}} players control the main protagonist, who can be named by the player. The environments within the Schwarzwelt are seen and navigated from a first-person perspective: the 3D environment is displayed on the top screen of the Nintendo DS, while a 2D map is displayed on the bottom screen. Explored environments are automatically mapped out, with highlights being placed for unopened containers and doorways. These environments contain traps including pits, shifting floors, and <b>floor</b> <b>tiles</b> which damage the protagonist if stepped on. Alongside the main story quests, human non-playable characters and demons within the Schwarzwelt unlock side quests which yielded rewards upon completion. During the game, the protagonist's Demonica suit can be upgraded to open new pathways, enabling entry into new areas for story progression, {{as well as new}} parts of previously explored areas.|$|E
5|$|Some monastic cells, {{thought to}} belong to the friary, survive under the Red Lodge, which had its origins as a {{prospect}} house for the prior of Whitefriars. This building became the lodge house of an Elizabethan mansion, the Great House, built in the late 16th century by John Young, who had bought the friary from Bristol Corporation after the Dissolution of the Monasteries. The Great House was where Elizabeth I stayed, as a guest of John Young, in 1574. In the 18th century, the house was acquired by Edward Colston, who established the original Colston's School there. After the school moved to Stapleton in 1857, the Colston Hall Society purchased the premises, and demolished the house to build the Colston Hall, which now occupies the site. Excavations during the building of the adjacent Colston House in the early 20th century found medieval walls, burials and <b>floor</b> <b>tiles.</b>|$|E

5|$|All Saints' {{originally}} {{consisted of}} a nave and chancel, to which a sanctuary was added in the first building phase. The church was extended on three occasions between the 10th and 14th centuries– a period of population growth– to include an aisled nave, a western tower and a northern chapel; its windows featured stained glass. The church was abandoned in the 15th century, presumably because the parish could no longer support two churches. It was demolished, and virtually all of its masonry removed, {{some of which may}} have been used in improvements to the church of St Nicholas. The settlement of Shuart remained as an area of local administration into the 17th century, but it is now regarded as a deserted medieval village. There were no visible remains of All Saints' Church by 1723, although land there remained as glebe belonging to the parish of St Nicholas. The site of All Saints' Church was excavated by archaeologists between 1978 and 1979. The main structure had been robbed of its materials leaving only the foundations, from which the archaeologists were able to interpret the history of the building's construction and its form. Among the foundations were discovered numerous stone carvings, <b>floor</b> <b>tiles,</b> remnants of stained glass, and several disturbed graves.|$|E

This research is conducted by testing samples with some mixtures of Portland cement, milled stone sand and tras (sand with a little cement content). There are ten mixtures which are tested. The result of the research shows that the best mixture is those of cement, milled stone sand and water, since they are having characteristic more elastic. Hence, to make better result of <b>floor</b> <b>tile</b> by replacing milled stone sand as sand substitution is suggested.

25|$|Many common {{building}} materials used before 1975 contain asbestos, such as some <b>floor</b> <b>tiles,</b> ceiling tiles, shingles, fireproofing, heating systems, pipe wrap, taping muds, mastics, and other insulation materials. Normally, significant releases of asbestos fiber {{do not occur}} unless the {{building materials}} are disturbed, such as by cutting, sanding, drilling, or building remodelling. Removal of asbestos-containing materials is not always optimal because the fibers can be spread into the air during the removal process. A management program for intact asbestos-containing materials is often recommended instead.|$|E

The <b>floor</b> <b>tiles</b> were salvaged, but the new space was floored with new tiles of a similar color and shape.
