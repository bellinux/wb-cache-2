40|$|Portable {{exhaust duct}} for {{machining}} and welding shops removes oil mist, dust, smoke, and fumes. Duct used with shop exhaust system, inlets of which placed at various convenient locations in shop floor. <b>Flanged</b> <b>connector</b> on underside of wheeled base links flexible tube to exhaust system under floor. Made especially for welding in room with low ceiling...|$|E
50|$|The Pirani gauge {{consists}} of a metal filament (usually platinum) suspended in a tube which {{is connected to the}} system whose vacuum is to be measured. Connection is usually made either by a ground glass joint or a <b>flanged</b> metal <b>connector,</b> sealed with an o-ring. The filament is connected to an electrical circuit from which, after calibration, a pressure reading may be taken.|$|R
40|$|An {{analytical}} method and a design procedure to develop <b>flanged</b> separable pipe <b>connectors</b> are discussed. A previously established algorithm {{is the basis}} for calculating low profile flanges. The characteristics and advantages of the low profile flange are analyzed. The use of aluminum, titanium, and plastics for flange materials is described. Mathematical models are developed to show the mechanical properties of various flange configurations. A computer program for determining the structural stability of the flanges is described...|$|R
