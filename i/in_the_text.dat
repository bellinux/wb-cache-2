40|$|Purpose/Aim: The {{purpose of}} this essay is {{to see how the}} media, through the newspaper, "Vi föräldrar”, {{produces}} family and parental roles, and to investigate how the image changed over time. Material/Method: The material consists of a number of selected <b>texts</b> from <b>the</b> years 1968, 1988 and 2008. The method used is a discourse analysis based on the three level model by Norman Fairclough. The three levels are <b>the</b> <b>text,</b> <b>the</b> discourse practise and <b>the</b> sociocultural practise. <b>In</b> this study two of <b>the</b> levels, <b>text</b> and sociocultural practise, are used <b>in</b> analysing <b>the</b> <b>texts.</b> Main results: Family and parenting <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> from 1968 can be linked to the structural functionalist theory <b>in</b> which <b>the</b> core family is central and women and men are assigned to specific roles. I have chosen to call the contents of <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> of 1968 a "core family discourse. " The feminist approach has influenced <b>the</b> content <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> from 1988 which I call a “gender discourse”. The individualization of the late modern period has resulted <b>in</b> freedom for <b>the</b> individual without specific gender roles or traditional family frameworks, which are evident <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>texts</b> from 2008. I have therefore chosen to refer to <b>the</b> 2008 <b>texts</b> as a "lifestyle discourse"...|$|R
