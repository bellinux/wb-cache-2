40|$|The {{attention}} {{of this group}} was focussed on four through-the-earth communication systems that are presently of high interest to the U. S. Bureau of Mines; four systems for providing operational/emergency communications on the working sections of coal mines, indeed up to the very face of the section. The systems are: uplink-data, downlink-voice, sidelink-call alert coded page, sidelink-roof bolt voice page. Each of these systems makes use of the mine overburden as the signal transmission medium, {{as opposed to the}} guiding wires, cables, and tunnels treated by the operational communications working group. Each of these systems satisfies {{one or more of the}} Bureau's objectives for mine communications systems; namely 2 Ì† 022 reliable links for monitoring the mine environment under both operational and emergency conditions. 2 Ì† 022 reliable links for communicating with miners during emergencies. 2 Ì† 022 special links for increasing the efficiency of day-to-day operations of the mine. Each of these systems has been successfully demonstrated on a limited experimental basis, and prototypes of all these systems are installed and operating in the USBM experimental mine in Bruceton, Pa.

40|$|Part Two of {{this report}} is based upon six working memoranda {{prepared}} {{during the first half}} of 1972 at an early stage in our work for the Bureau of Mines. This work presents preliminary performance estimates of baseband voice and narrowband through-the-earth <b>electromagnetic</b> <b>communications</b> systems of principal interest to the Bureau for operational/ emergency mine communications applications. The calculations were prepared to obtain early indications of the feasibility and governing parameters of such communications systems. They are based on limited, but pertinent, coal mine electromagnetic noise data acquired to-date by Bureau of Mines contractors; on theoretical signal-attenuation characteristics for two transmitter antenna types of present interest to the Bureau and on semi-empirical models which describe the intelligibility of voice communications as a function of the frequency variations of the signal-to-noise ratio across the voiceband. This work examines the cases of baseband voice and narrowband communications for uplink and downlink transmissions, for frequencies up to 3 kHz. Downlink transmissions are via a horizontal wire antenna, and uplink transmissions via a vertical-axis loop antenna, for typical mine depths of 300, 600, and 1000 feet. Representative coal-mine overburden conductivities of 10 - 2 mhos/meter (moderate and common) and 10 - 1 mhos/ meter (high) were used; the former figure for both voice and narrowband calculations and the latter for narrowband calculations only. Examples of high, moderate, and low, surface and subsurface, harmonic and broadband-impulsive noise conditions were taken from NBS and Westinghouse (WGL) mine noise data, together with examples of high- and low-levels of ELF atmospheric noise taken from M. I. T. Lincoln Laboratory data. The effects of simple voice spectrum shaping techniques on the intelligibility of through-the-earth voice communications are examined, and indexes of intelligibility more broadly based than signal-to-noise ratio are discussed. Finally, a means of overcoming the affects of 60 Hz noise and its harmonics which are the largest contributors to typical audio frequency in-mine noise, is suggested. These feasibility calculations are not intended to serve as definitive and complete treatments, but as a starting point: to establish first-order estimates of the magnitude and variability of transmitter power requirements under different noise, overburden conductivity, and mine depth conditions; to identify relationships, conditions, or frequencies that are likely to limit or enhance system performance; to reveal items requiring further investigation and data still required; and to suggest practical methods for optimizing system performance. These objectives were met by the calculations. Simple experiments to support these calculations can and should be carried out; together with more detailed investigations of specific modulation, coding, noise-suppression, voice-compression and signal-conditioning techniques, aimed at producing through-the-earth operational/emergency mine-communication systems that are not only effective, but practical and economically sound...|$|E

The proposed routing algorithm and the derived properties are general for all OTIS-Network, which will save the researchers effort to work on each on the OTIS-Networks individually. Two well-studied OTIS-Networks; OTIS-mesh and OTIS-hypercube are presented furthermore a broadcasting algorithm for OTIS-networks is discussed. This study provides new means for further testing {{the viability of the}} OTIS as alternative parallel computer architecture. Index Terms: Optoelectronic systems, OTIS, interconnection networks, parallel algorithms. optical technologies offer several fronts to improve this trade-off. The improved transmission rate, power consumption, and signal interference are few examples on these fronts [2, 10, 11, 12, 14]. Optoelectronic and optical networking will become the key enabling technologies of the future communications infrastructure through the elimination of the difficult limitation of bandwidth and bit-error rate inherent in traditional <b>electromagnetic</b> signal-based <b>communications</b> [5, 6]. <b>Electromagnetic</b> signals carried over copper (or coaxial) wires suffer from loss of strength and are subject to errors due to noise and hence such systems have limited data rates [13]. When copper or coax is replaced by fiber technology the achievable bandwidth is in excess of 50 terabits/second with an almost zero bit-error rate [13]. The full implications of essentially huge bandwidth and extremely low loss rates are only beginning to be recognized and will radically reshape the future network technologies. While in the past the communication link was the bottleneck, this link now holds the potential to become the enabler of new modes of computing far beyond those existing today [13]. 1...|$|R
40|$|Software defined {{radio and}} {{cognitive}} radio (SDR/CR) are promising concepts toward more optimally using the <b>electromagnetic</b> spectrum for <b>communications</b> and data transfer. These systems are highly agile {{in terms of}} modulation technique and frequency of operation due to early digitization and software processing of received radio frequency signals. However, the front ends of SDR/CR systems often use static antennas and switched banks of static, wide bandwidth filters before the digitization process. These components limit the ability of SDR/CR systems to operate in environments {{with high levels of}} interference and are therefore a bottleneck in the path to achieving optimal adaptation of wireless systems. This dissertation focuses on tunable and reconfigurable filter synthesis and design techniques that have the potential to alleviate the hardware adaptation bottleneck currently experienced by SDR/CR systems. The presented filter techniques and structures promise the capability to dynamically adapt the center frequency, order, response shape, bandwidth, group delay, passband insertion loss-stopband attenuation tradeoff, and transmission zero spectral location of a filter response in the field. Such reconfiguration capability is made possible through the use of new coupling relationships and structures that enable dynamic reconfiguration between electric, magnetic, and zero coupling values. ...|$|R
30|$|However, the {{resource}} allocation issue in molecular communication networks {{has not yet}} been investigated. In traditional <b>electromagnetic</b> wave wireless <b>communications,</b> when multiple users share the same resource, e.g., power and spectrum, how to allocate {{the resource}} among different users is very important to guarantee the high system efficiency while maintaining fairness [26, 27]. Similarly, in the diffusion-based molecular communications, there can be multiple transmitters sharing the same fluid medium. In such a case, interference will occur since the molecules from different transmitters are identical and indistinguishable [13]. Therefore, how to perform resource allocation among multiple transmitters, molecule emission control, is an essential problem in practical molecular communication systems. Generally, the computational capability of nanomachines is low, and the information exchange cost among them is expensive. Thus, distributed resource allocation algorithms are strongly favorable in molecular communications. Moreover, different nanomachines may be fabricated by different manufacturers and may have different objectives, e.g., in human body monitoring nanosensor networks [3], different biomedical sensors may have different functionalities and may be deployed by different doctors. Considering these problems, in this paper, we propose a game-theoretic framework for distributed resource allocation in diffusion-based molecular communications. The game-theoretical model provides distributed molecule emission control solutions to achieve high system efficiency, while guaranteing fairness among different nanomachines. Game theory has been corroborated as an effective tool for modeling different problems in traditional distributed wireless communication networks [28]. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first work that uses game theory to study the interactions among nanomachines in molecular communication networks, which is expected to exemplify the application of game theory in the nanocommunication and networking field.|$|R
40|$|Microwave {{radiation}} is emitted {{by a wide}} variety of computing, communications and other technologies. In many transport, industrial and medical contexts, humans are placed in close proximity to several of these sources of emission in reflective, enclosed cavities. Pseudo-reverberant conditions are created, in which absorption by human bodies can form a significant, even the dominant loss mechanism. The amount of energy stored, and hence the field intensities in these environments depend on the nature of electromagnetic absorption by the human body, so quantifying human absorption at these frequencies is necessary for accurate modelling of both <b>electromagnetic</b> interference and <b>communications</b> path loss in such situations. The research presented here aims to quantify absorption by the body, for the purpose of simulating its effect on the environments listed above. For this purpose, nine volunteer participants are enlisted in a preliminary study in which their height and mass are taken and their electromagnetic absorption cross section is measured in a reverberation chamber. The preliminary study is unable to gather enough data to provide precise measurements during the time that a participant is willing to sit motionless in the chamber. Issues also exist due to power loss {{in some parts of the}} equipment. A number improvements are made to both the experimental equipment and methodology, and the study is repeated with a sample of 60 adult volunteer participants. The results are compared to the preliminary data and found to match, once unwanted absorption in the latter has been subtracted. The results are also validated using data from absorption by a spherical phantom of known absorptive properties. The absorption cross section of the body is plotted and its behaviour is compared to several biometric parameters, of which the bodyâ€™s surface area is found to have a dominant effect on absorption. This is then normalised out to give an absorption efficiency of the skin, which is again compared to several biometric parameters; the strongest correlation is found to be with an estimate for average thickness of the subcutaneous fat layer. These data are used to model the effect of 400 passengers on the Q-factor of an airlinerâ€™s cabin. Absorption by the passengers is shown to be the dominant loss mechanism in the cabin, showing the importance of accounting for human absorption when modelling electromagnetic propagation and interference in situations that include human occupants. The relationship between subcutaneous fat and absorption efficiency is suggested for further research, as it promises development of new tools to study body composition, with possible medical applications...|$|R
40|$|This article {{represents}} a vision about how DNA might {{act as a}} topological quantum computer (tqc). Tqc means that the braidings of braid strands define tqc programs and M-matrix (generalization of S-matrix in zero energy ontology) defining the entanglement between states assignable to the end points of strands define the tqc usually coded as unitary time evolution for SchÃ¶dinger equation. One can ends up to the model in the following manner. a) Darwinian selection for which the standard theory of self-organization provides a model, should apply also to tqc programs. Tqc programs should correspond to asymptotic self-organization patterns selected by dissipation {{in the presence of}} metabolic energy feed. The spatial and temporal pattern of the metabolic energy feed characterizes the tqc program - or equivalently - sub-program call. b) Since braiding characterizes the tqc program, the self-organization pattern should correspond to a hydrodynamical flow or a pattern of magnetic field inducing the braiding. Braid strands must correspond to magnetic flux tubes of the magnetic body of DNA. If each nucleotide is transversal magnetic dipole it gives rise to transversal flux tubes, which can also connect to the genome of another cell. As a matter fact, the flux tubes would correspond to what I call wormhole magnetic fields having pairs of space-time sheets carrying opposite magnetic fluxes. c) The output of tqc sub-program is probability distribution for the outcomes of state function reduction so that the sub-program must be repeated very many times. It is represented as four-dimensional patterns for various rates (chemical rates, nerve pulse patterns, EEG power distributions, [...] .) having also identification as temporal densities of zero energy states in various scales. By the fractality of TGD Universe there is a hierarchy of tqcs corresponding to p-adic and dark matter hierarchies. Programs (space-time sheets defining coherence regions) call programs in shorter scale. If the self-organizing system has a periodic behavior each tqc module defines a large number of almost copies of itself asymptotically. Generalized EEG could naturally define this periodic pattern and each period of EEG would correspond to an initiation and halting of tqc. This brings in mind the periodically occurring sol-gel phase transition inside cell near the cell membrane. There is also a connection with hologram idea: EEG rhythm corresponds to reference wave and nerve pulse patters to the wave carrying the information and interfering with the reference wave. d) Fluid flow must induce the braiding which requires that the ends of braid strands must be anchored to the fluid flow. Recalling that lipid mono-layers of the cell membrane are liquid crystals and lipids of interior mono-layer have hydrophilic ends pointing towards cell interior, it is easy to guess that DNA nucleotides are connected to lipids by magnetic flux tubes and hydrophilic lipid ends are stuck to the flow. e) The topology of the braid traversing cell membrane cannot be affected by the hydrodynamical flow. Hence braid strands must be split during tqc. This also induces the desired magnetic isolation from the environment. Halting of tqc reconnects them and make possible the communication of the outcome of tqc. The model makes several testable predictions about DNA itself. In particular, matter-antimatter asymmetry and slightly broken isospin symmetry have counterparts at DNA level induced from the breaking of these symmetries for quarks and antiquarks associated with the flux tubes. DNA cell membrane system is not the only possible system that could perform tqc like activities and store memories in braidings: flux tubes could connect biomolecules and the braiding could provide an almost definition for {{what it is to be}} living. Even water memory might reduce to braidings. The model leads also to an improved understanding of other roles of the magnetic flux tubes containing dark matter. Phase transitions changing the value of Planck constant for the magnetic flux tubes could be key element of bio-catalysis and <b>electromagnetic</b> long distance <b>communications</b> in living matter. For instance, one ends up to what might be called code for protein folding and bio-catalysis. There is also a fascinating connection with Peter Gariaev's work suggesting that the phase transitions changing Planck constant have been observed and wormhole magnetic flux tubes containing dark matter have been photographed in his experiments...|$|R
