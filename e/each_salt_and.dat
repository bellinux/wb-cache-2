JS- 79 - 291) {{were given}} pre-sowing soak treatment for 24 h {{in a range}} (IO·s, 10 - 4,and 10. 3 M) of dilute solutions of 6 metal salts, selected out of 14 initially tested, viz. barium sulphate, lithium sulphate, manganese sulphate, cupric chloride, ferric chloride, and zinc chloride, and pot-grown 2 -week-old plants were soil inoculated with Sclerotium rolfsii, the first 5 salts substantially (61 - 77 %) inhibited disease symp-toms and reduced plant mortality by 45 to 75 % {{as compared to the}} control. Zinc chloride recorded milder effects. Only manganese sulphate had graded concentration effect, with the maximum at 10 · 3 M;for others optimum was either at 10 - 4 or lO. sM. None of the salts had any appreciable inhibitory effect on sclerotium germination. Biochemical studies with infected stem tissue from the optimum treatment for <b>each</b> <b>salt</b> <b>and</b> the control showed that the former usually recorded appreciable. increase in total phenol and o-dihydroxyphenol contents and also in peroxidase activity but reductions in pectolytic enzyme activity as compared to the latter.

A total of 27 isolates have been used for screening their stress tolerating ability with contrast to environmental abiotic soil conditions commonly prevailing in arid and semi-arid regions of Rajasthan. All the isolates were phenotypically and biochemically characterized followed by their plant assay test in growth pouches and pot experiment under controlled environmental conditions. Growth of pure rhizobial isolates on Yeast Extract Mannitol (YEM) medium having variable range of pH (4. 0 to 10. 0) and different concentrations of NaCl (0. 01 - 4. 5 %) were recorded at 540 nm using UV-VIS spectrophotometer after incubation at 28 ± 20 C for two days.

40|$|Chemical {{industries}} generate {{large amounts}} of wastewater rich in different chemical constituents. Amongst these, salts at high concentrations are of major concern, making necessary the treatment of saline effluents before discharge. Because most of these rejected streams comprise a combination {{of more than one}} salt at high concentration, it is reasonable to try to separate and revalorize them to promote circular economy at industry site level. For this reason, ion-exchange membranes based technologies were integrated in this study: selectrodialysis (SED) and electrodialysis with bipolar membranes (EDBM). Different process brines composed by Na 2 SO 4 and NaCl at different concentrations were treated first by SED to separate <b>each</b> <b>salt,</b> <b>and</b> then by EDBM to produce base (NaOH) and acids (HCl and H 2 SO 4) from each salt. The optimum of both electrolyte nature and concentration of the SED stack streams was evaluated.

Pure NaOH and a mixture of HCl and H 2 SO 4 with different purities could be obtained.

40|$|Adult and {{juvenile}} fish utilise salt marshes {{for food and}} shelter at high tide, moving into adjacent sublittoral regions during low tide. Understanding whether there are high levels of site fidelity for different species of coastal fish {{has important implications for}} habitat conservation and the design of marine protected areas. We hypothesised that common salt marsh fish species would demonstrate a high site fidelity, resulting in minimal inter-marsh connectivity. Carbon (13 C) and nitrogen (15 N) stable isotope ratios of larvae {{and juvenile}}s of five common salt marsh fish (Atherina presbyter, Chelon labrosus, Clupea harengus, Dicentrarchus labrax, Pomatoschistus microps), seven types of primary producer and seven secondary consumer food sources were sampled in five salt marshes within two estuary complexes along the coast of south-east England. Significant differences in 13 C and 15 N signatures between salt marshes indicated distinct sub-populations utilising the area of estuary around <b>each</b> <b>salt</b> marsh, <b>and</b> limited connectivity, even within the same estuary complex. 15 N ratios were responsible for the majority of inter-marsh differences for each species and showed similar site-specific patterns in ratios in primary producers, secondary consumers and fish. Fish diets (derived from isotope mixing models) varied between species but were mostly consistent between marsh sites, indicating that dietary shifts were not the source of variability of the inter-marsh isotopic signatures within species. These results demonstrate that for some common coastal fish species, high levels of site fidelity result in individual salt marshes operating as discrete habitats for fish assemblages. © 2011 Springer-Verlag...|$|R

40|$|This item is only {{available}} electronically. Stable drilling directions are {{directly affected by}} the in-situ stress orientations and magnitudes involved. For example, in the Gulf of Mexico delta top normal fault stress regime, where the maximum horizontal stress (σH) is margin-parallel, vertical wells are most stable. However, in-situ stress orientations are deflected around <b>salt</b> diapirs <b>and</b> have major implications for horizontal drilling risks. This study assesses the deflection of in-situ stress orientations and palaeostress orientations {{in close proximity to}} salt diapirs using 3 D seismic data from the Gulf of Mexico and structural field observations from the Amadeus Basin, central Australia. Seismic interpretation of salt diapirs in the Ship Shoal seismic cube (Gulf of Mexico) reveals gravitational collapse on the flanks of the salt diapirs, implying net normal displacement. This is consistent with the hypothesis that σH becomes locally deflected sub-parallel to the salt-sediment interface. The salt diapir in the Amadeus Basin field area is within a more complex structural setting compared to the Gulf of Mexico and is associated with a large NW-SE striking thrust fault. This implies that it has reacted to north-south shortening from the Alice Springs Orogeny. Palaeostress analysis from conjugate fracture pairs in the field area reveals a large variation in orientations for σ 1 and σ 3. However, σ 2 is consistently sub-perpendicular to bedding, thus σ 1 and σ 3 orientations are restricted to the plane of bedding. Evidence from both the 3 D Ship Shoal seismic cube and the structural field data suggests that in-situ stress is deflected around salt diapirs. However, the results from the field structural analysis are dissimilar to seismic interpretation from the Gulf of Mexico. In-situ stress deflections along the flanks of salt diapirs are associated with complex perturbations. These deflections are dependent on the structural setting of <b>each</b> <b>salt</b> diapir <b>and</b> whether it is interpreted as active, passive or reactive. Thesis (B. Sc.

These differences have been explained {{as a consequence}} of the different reproductive functions performed by the sexes.

PRI values also suggest intersexual differences in protection requirements against photoinhibition. The study did not find sex-differential responses to salt spray, which caused a decrease in reproductive effort in both sexes.

However, with estimated parameters based on the full range of the data, the models were able to represent the experimental data to within the uncertainty in the measurements...|$|R

40|$|Liquid-Liquid Equilibrium (LLE) {{data were}} {{obtained}} for the pseudo-ternary systems of propionic acid (PA) + water + solvents (methyl isopropyl ketone and methyl isobutyl ketone) + <b>salts</b> (NaCl <b>and</b> KCl) at 25 - 26 °C in order to study the effect of salts on extraction equilibrium of these systems by comparing with the same systems without salt. Mutual solubility curves, tie-line data, distribution coefficient, selectivity diagrams and separation factor data were determined for these systems. The salting-out effect was investigated by using inorganic salts NaCl or KCl at two concentrations of <b>each</b> <b>salt</b> within their solubility limits. The results obtained in these experiments showed that the <b>salts</b> NaCl <b>and</b> KCl significantly affect the solubility of PA in the organic solvents, {{as well as the}} distribution coefficients and separation factors for PA by changing their equilibrium composition and the selectivity of the solvents while the region of heterogeneity increases as compared to the same system of without salt. The thermodynamic consistency of the equilibrium tie-line data was ascertained by Othmer-Tobias plots as well as by Hand plots...|$|R
40|$|AbstractWe {{demonstrate}} {{the application of}} ‘top-down’ fabricated Si nanochannel field effect transistor biosensors in measuring the configuration of charged proteins immobilized on the Si surface. We have immobilized monoclonal antibodies of PSA (anti-PSA) on the p-type Si channel surface, and monitored the channel conductance {{in response to the}} variation of ionic strength (<b>salt</b> concentration) <b>and</b> pH level of the buffer solution. The dependency of channel conductance on the salt concentration is consistent with the screening of protein charges by dissolved counterions, enabling quantitative estimation of the distance from the Si surface to anti-PSA molecules based on calculated Debye screening lengths (λD) for <b>each</b> <b>salt</b> concentration. The effect of salt concentration on the pH-dependency of channel conductance has also been studied, and explained in terms of the net charge of anti-PSA as a function of pH...|$|R
