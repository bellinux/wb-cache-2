First, we propose an {{alternative}} way for treating deposits in modeling a banking firm, {{which account for}} both their input and output features. Second, we contribute to modeling failures in the banking sector by distinguishing three groups of factors affecting failures: bank level, industry level and economy-wide level, recognizing {{the risks associated with}} these factors. We apply both models to a data set of Russian banks, spanning 1999 - 2004. Traditionally researchers assumed that deposits are either an input, used to generate loans (intermediation approach) or an output, a service that a bank provides, utilizing labor and capital (production approach). In Chapter 2 we propose to account for both input and output characteristics of deposits by introducing a substitution effect. In the framework of non-parametric Data Envelopment Analysis we maximize deposits, just like other outputs, while introducing the possibility of substitution between <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> other <b>borrowed</b> <b>funds,</b> an input. Even though we did not find evidence that the results of our model are significantly different from the other two approaches, it is still preferred, since it provides a more general way of treating deposits: both production and intermediation models can be deduced from it. Chapter 3 extends existing literature on modeling bank failures. We model failures as a function of different risks that a banking firm faces. We argue that a bank fails if cumulative risks exceed an unobserved critical level and use a binary response model to carry out our empirical estimation for a sample of Russian banks. We add the efficiency metric from Chapter 2 to our data set {{and use it as a}} proxy for managerial quality. We also adjust for the fact that bank failures represent rare events as suggested by King and Zeng (2001). We found that higher <b>deposit</b> <b>and</b> liquid assets balances, as well as efficiency (banks-specific variables) were crucial in affecting failures, while macroeconomic and industry-level variables appeared to be not as important...|$|R

40|$|Capital {{structure}} is {{the composition of}} debt and equity securities {{that are used to}} finance company’s assets. Both debt and equity securities are used by most of the companies to raise funds. Having determined its investment policy, a company should plan the sources of finance and their mix. Companies which do not formally plan their capital structures are likely to face difficulties in raising capital on favourable terms in the long-run. Financial experts and authorities differ as to the composition of funds in capital structure [...] Many authors include only long-term sources of finance under the capital structure. Broadly speaking, the capital structure comprises owned <b>funds</b> <b>and</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>funds.</b> The owned funds include the share capital and free reserves and surplus <b>and</b> the <b>borrowed</b> <b>funds</b> represent debentures, long-term and medium-term loans provided by various financial institutions.

The relationship between the Crown and General Farms fits the model of sovereign debt as a contingent claim.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{the relationship between}} the structure of the interbank lending market and systemic risk. We consider a model in which banks finance investment opportunities through household <b>deposits</b> <b>and</b> <b>borrowing</b> from other banks. Using simulation techniques a range of interbank markets structures are considered. It is shown that greater levels of interbank connectivity reduce the risk of contagion from the failure of a single bank. In response to system wide shocks, however, the effect of connectivity is ambiguous, reducing contagion for small shocks but exacerbating it for larger events. Regulatory changes including forcing banks to hold more reserves, be less leveraged or constraining the size of borrowing relations are tested and their effects considered...|$|R
30|$|Another {{possible}} interpretation for {{the positive}} link between windfall gains and labour supply {{can be attributed}} to attitudes towards risk and how they differ across own <b>and</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>funds.</b> For instance, Taylor (2001) suggests that when entrepreneurial activity and effort are substitutes, the receipt of a windfall gain by a liquidity-constrained entrepreneur raises future self-employment utility and can lead to higher self-employment income. As for the case of a liquidity-unconstrained entrepreneur, the windfall gain may end up reducing income {{as a result of a}} focus on less profitable aspects of the business, which are compensated by an increase in job satisfaction. Ogaki and Zhang (2001) find empirical evidence corroborating the existence of a decreasing relative risk aversion. Sousa (forthcoming) highlights that the proportion of risky assets that is held by investors increases after a positive shock to wealth, which suggests the existence of habit-formation, loss aversion or wealth-dependent preferences 21.|$|R

40|$|A {{government}} delegates a build-operate-transfer {{project to}} a private firm in a limited-commitment framework. When the contract is signed, parties are uncertain about the operating cost. The firm can {{increase the likelihood of}} facing a low cost by exerting some non-contractible effort while building the facility. Once the facility is in place, the firm learns the marginal cost and begins to operate. We characterize the contract which stipulates the efficient allocation. We study the financial structure and duration that secure its enforcement. To this end, we take into account that break-up of the partnership occasions a replacement cost for the government and an expropriation cost for the firm and its lender. Furthermore, both these costs are higher the earlier the contract is terminated. Enforcement is achieved as follows. The firm is instructed to invest some intermediate amount of own <b>and</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>funds.</b> Under the aegis of a third party that can commit, the government provides guarantees to the lender, conditional on continuation of the partnership.

50|$|Thereafter, the Queensland Government took {{responsibility}} for building the colony's railways. The first Railway Bill, authorising {{the government to}} construct <b>and</b> <b>borrow</b> <b>funds</b> for this purpose was passed on 3 September 1863. In the lead up to the Bill, Irish civil engineer Abraham Fitzgibbon, estimating comparative construction costs of rail gauges between Ipswich and Toowoomba, recommended to the government {{the adoption of a}} light railway with a 3-foot 6 inch narrow gauge (1067 mm). The ascent of the Main Range was the principal engineering and expense obstacle for the railway to Toowoomba and a narrow gauge allowed for tighter rail curves on the Range incline. A lighter railway with extensive use of curved track meant cheaper construction costs, lessening capital outlay. After much debate, the Queensland government adopted Fitzgibbon's proposal. While contemporary examples of shorter narrow gauge railways existed {{in other parts of the}} world, none were of the length or scale proposed for Queensland. The railway between Ipswich and Toowoomba was the first use of a narrow gauge for a main line.|$|R

In this paper, the author studied the issues of formation of financial resources of the bank, analysis, structuring, effective management. The basis of the study was the work of Russian and foreign scientists and researchers groups. Total compare and analyze the essence of the definition of financial resources 9 scholars (groups of scientists), who were divided into three groups. The results of the study show that there is no single definition of the financial resources among the domestic and foreign scientists, but the interpretation of the concept of banking financial resources are very similar. The first group of scientists determines the bank resources as the total amount of funds available to the bank, which are used to carry out active operations. The second group of scientists gives a broader definition of the essence of banking resources. They believe that the bank is a collection of resources of their own and «foreign» (attracted) funds that are used to carry out active operations. The third group of scientists lead the most accurate, thorough and comprehensive definition of bank resources. According to them, banking resources - a combination of their own, attracted <b>and</b> <b>borrowed</b> <b>funds,</b> which are held by a bank and used to carry out banking activities.
