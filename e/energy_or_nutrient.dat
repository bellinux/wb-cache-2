5000|$|Although hunger {{may arise}} from <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrient</b> deficits, as would be {{expected}} in the set-point theories of hunger and eating, hunger may arise more commonly from anticipated pleasure of eating, consistent with the positive-incentive perspective. Gramlich distinguished the overeating responses to these stimuli as homeostatic hyperphagia and hedonic hyperphagia respectively. Accordingly, hunger and eating are subject to feedback control from homeostatic, hedonic, and cognitive processes. Although these mechanisms interplay and overlap to some extent, they can nonetheless be individually separated. Thus, the positive-incentive perspective suggests that eating is similar to sexual behavior: humans engage in sexual behavior, not because of an internal deficit, but because they have evolved {{in a way that makes}} them crave it. High calorie foods have had intrinsic reward value throughout evolution. The presence of desirable (or [...] "hedonic") food, or the mere anticipation of it, makes one hungry. [...] The psychological effects of hedonic hunger may be the appetitive equivalent of hedonically-driven activities such as recreational drug use and compulsive gambling. Susceptibility to food cues can lead to overeating in a society of readily available calorie dense, inexpensive foods. Such hedonistic eating overrides the body's ability to regulate consumption with satiety.|$|E

40|$|The {{relative}} importance of genetic vs. environmental factors in determining the pattern of avian post-embryonic development is much debated. Previous cross-fostering of albatrosses suggested that although inter-specific variation in growth rate was determined primarily by differences in dietary energy content, species-specific constraints might have evolved that could limit maximal growth, even in chicks fed at similar rates and on similar diets. This study aimed to determine whether intrinsic differences in resting metabolic rate were apparent during the linear phase of growth in chicks of three species (black-browed, grey-headed and light-mantled sooty albatrosses). There was a gradual increase in absolute, {{and a reduction in}} mass-specific metabolic rate from 5. 0 W kg− 1 during the earliest part of linear growth, to 3. 5 W kg− 1 by the time chicks reached peak mass. These values are considerably higher than in resting adults of comparable or lower mass, presumably reflecting the large size and high metabolic demand of organs involved in rapid nutrient processing and tissue synthesis by chicks.

NAFLD comprises a wide spectrum of liver damage ranging fat accumulation (steatosis) to steatosis with inflammation (non-alcoholic steatohepatitis, NASH), which can further progress to fibrosis. In particular patients with NASH have increased risk to develop other metabolic complications, such as cardiovascular disease. NAFLD is a complex disease, in which the origin and molecular mechanisms controlling the progression of simple steatosis to NASH remain poorly understood. Nevertheless, it is thought that inflammation is a critical component of NAFLD progression. This inflammation may be triggered by metabolic surplus (excess of <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrients)</b> and is also referred to as “metabolic inflammation”.

40|$|Grass-based diets are of {{increasing}} social-economic importance in dairy cattle farming, but their low supply of glucogenic nutrients may limit {{the production of}} milk. Current evaluation systems that assess the energy supply and requirements are based on metabolisable energy (ME) or net energy (NE). These systems do not consider {{the characteristics of the}} energy delivering nutrients. In contrast, mechanistic models take into account the site of digestion, the type of nutrient absorbed and the type of nutrient required for production of milk constituents, and may therefore give a better prediction of supply and requirement of nutrients. The objective of the present study is to compare the ability of three energy evaluation systems, viz. the Dutch NE system, the agricultural and food research council (AFRC) ME system, and the feed into milk (FIM) ME system, and of a mechanistic model based on Dijkstra et al. [Simulation of digestion in cattle fed sugar cane: prediction of nutrient supply for milk production with locally available supplements. J. Agric. Sci., Cambridge 127, 247 - 60] and Mills et al. [A mechanistic model of whole-tract digestion and methanogenesis in the lactating dairy cow: model development, evaluation and application. J. Anim. Sci. 79, 1584 - 97] to predict the feed value of grass-based diets for milk production. The dataset for evaluation consists of 41 treatments of grass-based diets (at least 0. 75 g ryegrass/g diet on DM basis). For each model, the predicted <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrient</b> supply, based on observed intake, was compared with predicted requirement based on observed performance. Assessment of the error of <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrient</b> supply relative to requirement is made by calculation of mean square prediction error (MSPE) and by concordance correlation coefficient (CCC). All energy evaluation systems predicted energy requirement to be lower (6 - 11 %) than energy supply. The root MSPE (expressed as a proportion of the supply) was lowest for the mechanistic model (0. 061), followed by the Dutch NE system (0. 082), FIM ME system (0. 097) and AFRCME system(0. 118). For the energy evaluation systems, the error due to overall bias of prediction dominated the MSPE, whereas for the mechanistic model, proportionally 0. 76 of MSPE was due to random variation. CCC analysis confirmed the higher accuracy and precision of the mechanistic model compared with energy evaluation systems. The error of prediction was positively related to grass protein content for the Dutch NE system, and was also positively related to grass DMI level for all models. In conclusion, current energy evaluation systems overestimate energy supply relative to energy requirement on grass-based diets for dairy cattle. The mechanistic model predicted glucogenic nutrients to limit performance of dairy cattle on grass-based diets, and proved to be more accurate and precise than the energy systems. The mechanistic model could be improved by allowing glucose maintenance and utilization requirements parameters to be variable. (C) 2007 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved...|$|E

However, it is unclear whether these effects on body composition are specific to pork or whether consumption of other high protein meat diets may have the same benefit. Therefore we aimed to compare regular consumption of pork, beef and chicken on indices of adiposity. In a nine month randomised open-labelled cross-over intervention trial, 49 overweight or obese adults were randomly assigned to consume up to 1 kg/week of pork, chicken or beef, in an otherwise unrestricted diet for three months, followed by two further three month periods consuming each of the alternative meat options. BMI and waist/hip circumference were measured and body composition was determined using dual energy x-ray absorptiometry. Dietary intake was assessed using three day weighed food diaries. Energy expenditure was estimated from activity diaries. There was no difference in BMI or any other marker of adiposity between consumption of pork, beef and chicken diets. Similarly there were no differences in <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrient</b> intakes between diets.

40|$|The {{endoplasmic}} reticulum(ER) is a multifunctional organelle {{within which}} protein folding, lipid biosynthesis, and calcium storage occurs. Perturbations such as <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrient</b> depletion, disturbances in calcium or redox status that disrupt ER homeostasis {{lead to the}} misfolding of proteins, ER stress and up-regulation of several signaling pathways coordinately called the unfolded protein response (UPR). The UPR {{is characterized by the}} induction of chaperones, degradation of misfolded proteins and attenuation of protein translation. The UPR plays a fundamental role in the maintenance of cellular homeostasis and thus is central to normal physiology. However sustained unresolved ER stress leads to apoptosis. Aging linked declines in expression and activity of key ER molecular chaperones and folding enzymes compromise proper protein folding and the adaptive response of the UPR. One mechanism to explain age associated declines in cellular functions and age-related diseases is a progressive failure of chaperoning systems. In many of these diseases proteins or fragments of proteins convert from their normally soluble forms to insoluble fibrils or plaques that accumulate in a variety of organs including the liver, brain or spleen. This group of diseases, which typically occur late in life includes Alzheimer’s, Parkinson’s, type II diabetes and a host of less well known but often equally serious conditions such as fatal familial insomnia. The UPR is implicated in many of these neurodegenerative and familial protein folding diseases as well as several cancers and a host of inflammatory diseases including diabetes, atherosclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease and arthritis.

40|$|BACKGROUND: An {{ecological}} flow network is a weighted directed graph {{in which the}} nodes are species, the edges are "who eats whom" relationships and the weights are rates of <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrient</b> transferred between species. Allometric scaling is a ubiquitous feature for flow systems such as river basins, vascular networks and food webs. METHODOLOGY: The "ecological network analysis" can serve to reveal hidden allometries, the power law relationship between the throughflux and the indirect impact of node [Formula: see text], directly from the original flow networks without any need to cut edges in the network. The dissipation law, which is another significant scaling relationship between the energy dissipation (respiration) and the throughflow of any species, is also obtained from {{an analysis of the}} empirical flow networks. Interestingly, the exponents of the allometric law ([Formula: see text]) and the dissipation law ([Formula: see text]) show a strong relationship for both empirical and simulated flow networks. The dissipation law exponent [Formula: see text], rather than the topology of the network, is the most important factors that affect the allometric exponent [Formula: see text]. CONCLUSIONS: The exponent [Formula: see text] can be interpreted as the degree of centralization of the network, i. e., the concentration of impacts (direct and indirect influences on the entire network along all energy flow pathways) on hubs (the nodes with large throughflows). As a result, we find that as [Formula: see text] increases, the relative energy loss of large nodes increases, [Formula: see text] decreases, i. e., the relative importance of large species decreases. Moreover, the entire flow network is more decentralized. Therefore, network flow structure (allometry) and thermodynamic constraints (dissipation) are linked...|$|E

Nutrient claims are representations that state, suggest or imply that a given product presents specific nutrient properties regarding its <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrient</b> content. The information on the packages can be used as strategies to promote the purchase of these foods, including those targeted at children. In this population, the consumption of processed foods with excessive amounts of calories, sugar, sodium and/or fat, is high, and has been related to high rates of overweight and obesity. The aim of this research was to verify differences between the nutritional composition and the presence of nutrient claims on food labels of processed food products targeted and not targeted at children. A cross-sectional study was conducted, employing a census-type survey, between October and December, 2013, at a supermarket belonging to one of the top ten biggest Brazilian supermarket chains. Food products targeted and not targeted at children were identified, and organized in groups according to the Brazilian Federal Resolution # 359 / 2003. Results are based on the analysis of 5620 food items, 535 (9. 5 %) of which were considered targeted at children {{because of the presence of}} at least one marketing strategy targeted at this public - 50. 5 % of these presented nutrient claims on their labels. Processed food products targeted at children (n= 535) presented significant higher amounts of calories and carbohydrates, and lower amounts of fiber and sodium than those not targeted at them (p< 0. 05); food products targeted at children presented higher content of carbohydrates in groups 4 (dairy products), 5 (meat and eggs) and 7 (sugars and food products with energy from carbohydrates and fat). Regarding total fat, lower amounts were observed in groups 1 (baked goods, cereals, grain legumes, roots and tubers), 4 and 7. Fiber content was lower in groups 1 and 7 and higher in group 5. Sodium content was lower in groups 4, 5 and 8 (sauces, spices, gravies, soups and ready meals), and higher in group 7 (p< 0. 05). Food products targeted at children presented a 52 % higher prevalence of nutrient claims on their labels (p< 0. 001) than food products not targeted at children. Similar outcome was observed in groups 4, 5 and 7 (prevalence was 79, 256 and 61 % higher, respectively) (p< 0. 001). Outcomes indicate that most processed food products targeted at children sold in the selected supermarket belong in group 7. In this group are included sweetened chocolate powder, filled and not filled cookies, sweets, sodas and savory snacks, some of children's favorites. Foods targeted and not targeted at children are different regarding their nutrition composition. Lower fiber amounts and higher carbohydrate and sodium amounts observed in some groups of foods targeted at children, could indicate a high palatability. It should be highlighted that a big part of carbohydrates presented on the nutrition labeling probably come from added sugar. This could not be confirmed, however, because according to Brazilian legislation, it is not mandatory to inform the products' sugar content. In addition to marketing strategies on food labels of products targeted at children, these products presented a higher prevalence of nutrient claims on them. Therefore, it is necessary to include mandatory information of sugar on processed food labels, as well as to establish reference parameters to establish the excessive amounts of sugar, fat and sodium they may contain. These actions would clarify the information to consumers and allow them to make better choices. The parameters could be used to use nutrient claims on food products...|$|E

Methods. A cross-sectional design was used to compare the influence of PPN with or without adding MTV and TE on malnourished abdominal surgery patients. Results. Both preoperative groups received equal calories and protein, but {{due to the lack of}} micronutrients, patients in preoperative Group B exhibited higher inflammation, lower serum albumin levels, and higher anastomotic leak rates and also required prolonged hospital stays. Conclusion. Malnourished patients who receive micronutrient supplementation preoperatively have lower postoperative inflammatory responses and better prognoses. PPN with added fat emulsion, MTV, and TE provides valid and effective preoperative nutritional support...|$|R

40|$|An {{ecological}} flow network is a weighted directed graph in which nodes are species, edges are "who eats whom" relationships and weights are rates of <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrients</b> transfer between species. Allometric scaling is a ubiquitous feature for flow systems like river basins, vascular networks and food webs. By "ecological network analysis" method, we can reveal the hidden allometry {{directly on the}} original flow networks without cutting edges. On the other hand, dissipation law, which is another significant scaling relationship between the energy dissipation (respiration) and the throughflow of any species is also discovered on the collected flow networks. Interestingly, the exponents of allometric law (η) and the dissipation law (γ) have a strong connection for both empirical and simulated flow networks. The dissipation law exponent γ rather than the topology of the network {{is the most important}} ingredient to the allometric exponent η. By reinterpreting η as the inequality of species impacts (direct and indirect influences) to the whole network along all energy flow pathways but not the energy transportation efficiency, we found that as γ increases, the relative energy loss of large nodes (with high throughflow) increases, η decreases, and the inequality of the whole flow network as well as the relative importance of large species decreases. Therefore, flow structure and thermodynamic constraint are connected. Comment: 35 pages, 13 figure...|$|R
40|$|BACKGROUND: The {{electronic}} Dietary Intake Assessment (e-DIA), {{a digital}} entry food record mobile phone app, {{was developed to}} measure energy and nutrient intake prospectively. This {{can be used in}} monitoring population intakes or intervention studies in young adults. OBJECTIVE: The objective was to assess the relative validity of e-DIA as a dietary assessment tool for energy and nutrient intakes using the 24 -hour dietary recall as a reference method. METHODS: University students aged 19 to 24 years recorded their food and drink intake on the e-DIA for five days consecutively and completed 24 -hour dietary recalls on three random days during this 5 -day study period. Mean differences in energy, macro-, and micronutrient intakes were evaluated between the methods using paired t tests or Wilcoxon signed-rank tests, and correlation coefficients were calculated on unadjusted, energy-adjusted, and deattenuated values. Bland-Altman plots and cross-classification into quartiles were used to assess agreement between the two methods. RESULTS: Eighty participants completed the study (38 % male). No {{significant differences were found between}} the two methods for mean intakes of <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrients.</b> Deattenuated correlation coefficients ranged from 0. 55 to 0. 79 (mean 0. 68). Bland-Altman plots showed wide limits of agreement between the methods but without obvious bias. Cross-classification into same or adjacent quartiles ranged from 75 % to 93 % (mean 85 %). CONCLUSIONS: The e-DIA shows potential as a dietary intake assessment tool at a group level with good ranking agreement for energy and all nutrients. published_or_final_versio...|$|R
40|$|The {{impact of}} bird populations upon the {{properties}} or processes of ecosystems is mediated through patterns and magnitudes of energy flow. This impact may be either direct, by processing of {{large quantities of}} <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrients,</b> <b>or</b> indirect, through feedback control of other ecosystem rate processes or components. In either case, however, the impact {{is a result of}} the population dynamics and the pattern and magnitude of food consumption of the birds. Recent research by several groups points to a relatively small direct impact on birds on most natural ecosystems (Wiens 1973). Impact through feedback control, a more difficult relationship to study, is just beginning to receive close attention in a total systems framework. In managed ecosystems, however, where our interest is in either the bird population or its prey as an aesthetic or economic resource, the direct impacts are of considerable importance. These direct impacts are a reflection of prey consumption, which in turn {{is a result of the}} interactions of prey selection and energy demand. There is little field information available on either of these components for most bird populations, however, and we have therefore employed simulation modelling, coupled with existing information on dietary composition, to generate estimates of prey consumption rates and thus of potential impact. Our modelling tactic has been to stress generality and biological realism at the expense of precision (Levins 1966), since we are interested in models which are both robust and broadly applicable. Also, we recognize that the data base of the model is frequently imprecise, and it seems intuitively illogical to build extremely precise models for imprecise data inputs, even though this if often done...|$|R
40|$|As misreporting, mostly under-reporting, {{of dietary}} intake is a {{generally}} known problem in nutritional research, we aimed to analyse {{the association between}} selected determinants {{and the extent of}} misreporting by the duplicate portion method (DP), 24 h recall (24 hR) and FFQ by linear regression analysis using the biomarker values as unbiased estimates. For each individual, two DP, two 24 hR, two FFQ and two 24 h urinary biomarkers were collected within 1 · 5 years. Also, for sixty-nine individuals one or two doubly labelled water measurements were obtained. The associations of basic determinants (BMI, gender, age and level of education) with misreporting of energy, protein and K intake of the DP, 24 hR and FFQ were evaluated using linear regression analysis. Additionally, associations between other determinants, such as physical activity and smoking habits, and misreporting were investigated. The Netherlands. One hundred and ninety-seven individuals aged 20 – 70 years. Higher BMI was associated with under-reporting of dietary intake assessed by the different dietary assessment methods for energy, protein and K, except for K by DP. Men tended to under-report protein by the DP, FFQ and 24 hR, and persons of older age under-reported K but only by the 24 hR and FFQ. When adjusted for the basic determinants, the other determinants did not show a consistent association with misreporting of <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrients</b> and by the different dietary assessment methods. As BMI was the only consistent determinant of misreporting, we conclude that BMI should always be taken into account when assessing and correcting dietary intake. <br/...|$|R
40|$|Ecosystems {{that are}} {{depicted}} as nodes (species groups) and links (trophic transfers) encompass well defined roles {{in terms of}} their trophic structure. Some are primary producers and furnish the system with newly bound <b>energy</b> <b>or</b> <b>nutrients,</b> whereas others divide themselves over various trophic levels creating a hierarchy of energy use and reuse. All waste and mortality products of nodes comprise the non-living environment of ecosystems, often supporting a considerable part of the system as detritus. All food sources are in general used, but are so to variable extents. Some links are always among the major links, e. g. flows from detritus or remineralisation from bacteria. Similarly, flows into and from high turnover nodes, which are either small species with high turnover rates, or those with disproportional high standing stock {{play an important role in}} shunting energy through the system. Ecosystem indices calculated from weighted ecological networks describing the patterns of energy flow through an ecosystem are often applied to empirical data in order to categorise the system as an efficient <b>or</b> inefficient <b>energy</b> user. We calculated flow diversity (as Shannon's Index) and average mutual information (AMI, as the degree of flow constraint) according to the method of Ulanowicz (1986). Special attention was given to the contribution of each system part to the overall holistic property. A comparison of several, mainly estuarine, ecosystems, shows that it is mostly flows involving the same species groups contributing to the bulk to the index value. These were flows from detritus, bacteria, and primary producers. The relative importance of flows from heterotrophic groups (e. g., species and species groups of macrozoobenthos, meiofauna, zooplankton, fish) compared to that of the "main" groups was comparatively minor...|$|R
40|$|Extreme {{climate and}} weather events, {{such as a}} drought, hurricanes, or ice storms, can {{strongly}} imprint ecosystem processing and may alter ecosystem structure. Ecosystems in extreme environments are particularly vulnerable because of their adaptation to severe limitations in <b>energy,</b> water, <b>or</b> <b>nutrients.</b> The vulnerability can be expressed as a relatively long-lasting ecosystem response to a small or brief change in environmental conditions. Such an event occurred in Antarctica and affected two vastly different ecosystems: a marine-dominated coastal system and a terrestrial polar desert. Both sites experienced winds that warmed air temperatures above the 0 °C threshold, resulting in extensive snow and ice melt and triggering a series of cascading effects through the ecosystems that are continuing to play out {{more than a decade}} later. This highlights the sensitivity of Antarctic ecosystems to warming events, which should occur more frequently in the future with global climate warming...|$|R
