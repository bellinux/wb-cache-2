5|$|<b>His</b> <b>refusal</b> {{to accept}} {{anything}} short of total victory was pivotal in the final outcome. His tenacity was well-paid {{with the news that}} López had died in battle on 1 March 1870, bringing the war to a close. PedroII turned down the General Assembly's suggestion to erect an equestrian statue of him to commemorate the victory and chose instead to use the money to build elementary schools.|$|E
5|$|In {{stories of}} higher caste Hindus (especially Brahmins), Nandanar is a Brahmin or God himself somehow {{trapped in the}} body of an {{untouchable}} and whose true form is revealed by the fire trial. Other tales focus on his strict adherence to caste norms, his obedience of his Brahmin master and <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to enter the holy temple as an untouchable.|$|E
5|$|Whale was {{openly gay}} {{throughout}} his career, {{something that was}} very unusual in the 1920s and 1930s. As knowledge of his sexual orientation has become more common, some of his films, Bride of Frankenstein in particular, have been interpreted as having a gay subtext {{and it has been}} claimed that <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to remain in the closet led {{to the end of his}} career.|$|E
60|$|So {{she poured}} some strong brandy and water down Amyas's throat, {{in spite of}} <b>his</b> <b>refusals,</b> and sent him to bed, but not to sleep; and {{after a night of}} tossing, he started for Bideford, having {{obtained}} the means for so doing from Mrs. Hawkins.|$|R

"I greatly regret, Sigriore, {{it should}} be so," [...] resumed the baron, turning to the {{applicant}} with the consideration of one accustomed to season <b>his</b> <b>refusals</b> by a gracious manner; [...] "but these watermen have their secret signs, by which, it would seem, they know the latest moment they may with prudence delay." ...|$|R
5|$|Wilson {{began to}} recover {{by the end}} of 1919, but {{remained}} secluded for the remainder of his term, steadfast in <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> or inability to accept changes to the treaty. Marshall was prevented from meeting with him to ascertain his true condition until his final day in office. It remains unclear who was making the executive branch's decisions during Wilson's incapacity, but it was likely the first lady {{with the help of the}} presidential advisers.|$|E
5|$|A seizure {{does not}} occur just because the {{government}} questions an individual in a public place. The exclusionary rule would not bar voluntary answers to such questions from being offered into evidence in a subsequent criminal prosecution. The person is not being seized if his freedom of movement is not restrained. The government may not detain an individual even momentarily without reasonable, objective grounds, with few exceptions. <b>His</b> <b>refusal</b> to listen or answer does not by itself furnish such grounds.|$|E
5|$|At {{a hearing}} on May 22, 1990, Judge Brett {{announced}} <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to reconsider the seven dismissed claims, ending the lawsuit, and ruled all remaining pending motions moot. At the hearing, Brett said that the issue {{at the heart of}} the suit was the highway's effect on area residents. While this was a legitimate interest, the judge said, it was not covered by the environmental laws under which the plaintiffs chose to challenge the project. Brett also pointed out that the environmental questions were at that time under review by the appropriate federal agencies.|$|E
50|$|During {{his time}} as German Minister of Finance, he became the second-most {{powerful}} man in federal politics. He {{was known for his}} tight fiscal policies, aimed at keeping the German currency stable. In this role, he strongly resisted any reparation claims to victims of the Nazi reign. After German rearmament, Schäffer was engaged in many arguments about defense spending, often irritating his NATO partners by <b>his</b> <b>refusals</b> to allocate more money to it.|$|R

5|$|At {{this stage}} of the war, Braithwaite, a popular commander, was {{temporarily}} in charge of the division while Russell was on leave. The last of the brigade commanders who had embarked with the NZEF in 1914, he was worn out and in January was evacuated to England for treatment. On recovery, Braithwaite rejoined his original British Army regiment rather than returning to the division. There were rumours amongst the soldiers of the division that this was a punishment for <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to carry on with the 12 October attack at Passchendaele.|$|E
5|$|Culverhouse was {{initially}} lauded for bringing professional football to the Tampa Bay area, but eventually {{came to be}} blamed for the team's struggles. <b>His</b> <b>refusal</b> to pay Doug Williams at a salary level {{comparable to that of}} the league's top quarterbacks insulted fans, and was seen as the beginning of the team's decline during the 1980s. It further led to the belief that Culverhouse was unconcerned with fielding a winning team, {{as long as it was}} financially profitable. The Buccaneers' NFL-record streak of fourteen consecutive losing seasons cemented this perception, although Culverhouse did make several notable attempts to improve the team.|$|E
5|$|Diệm {{reportedly}} saw {{the poll}} {{as an opportunity}} to legitimise him as a symbol of Vietnamese democracy, so that he could frame and justify <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to participate in national elections as a struggle between freedom and communist authoritarianism. Diệm asserted that South Vietnam would eventually reunify the nation under a democratic administration and liberate their northern compatriots from communist oppression, and championed the referendum as a first step in nurturing democracy. His support base was to use this as a means of justifying the deposal of Bảo Đại, citing past decisions that according to them, were pro-communist.|$|E

50|$|Tobin {{begins to}} attract {{attention}} form the other boys, with <b>his</b> <b>refusals</b> to join them in the brothels and his stunted growth. However, he proves himself in battle against brigands, rallying the Companions to him, while Prince Korin freezes {{in the heat of}} battle. Pregnant again, Aliya gives birth to a dead, hideously deformed child without face or legs, Niryn's work (which he quickly blames on the renegade wizards). Lady Aliya then dies in the birth, along with the child, destroying Prince Korin's royal line.|$|R
5|$|During these years, Harrison {{exhibited}} {{a number of}} personality quirks that became legendary. One was his habit of calling in subordinates to dine {{with him in the}} executive dining room by sending them a blue chip that had the meal's conversational topic written on it. Usually the topics were intellectual rather than related to the running of the railroad. Another oddity was <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to use his railroad pass, which entitled him to free travel. Instead, he personally paid for his commute between his home and the railroad's offices.|$|E
5|$|He {{was moved}} to the Bureau of Topography of the Committee of Public Safety and sought unsuccessfully to be {{transferred}} to Constantinople in order to offer his services to the Sultan. During this period, he wrote the romantic novella Clisson et Eugénie, about a soldier and his lover, in a clear parallel to Bonaparte's own relationship with Désirée. On 15 September, Bonaparte was removed from the list of generals in regular service for <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to serve in the Vendée campaign. He faced a difficult financial situation and reduced career prospects.|$|E
5|$|In January 1861, Missouri {{called a}} {{convention}} {{to determine whether}} it would follow the lead of other pro-slavery states and secede from the Union. Knott was sympathetic to the southern cause, but opposed the methods of the secessionists. The Unionist position carried the convention by an 80,000-vote majority. Knott resigned his position as attorney general rather than take an oath of allegiance required by the federal government. As a result of <b>his</b> <b>refusal,</b> he was disbarred from practice in the state of Missouri and imprisoned for a short time.|$|E

50|$|Vela {{made his}} debut with the senior Mexico {{national}} team in 2007 {{in a friendly}} match against Brazil, and scored his first goal for Mexico in a friendly against Guatemala. He participated in Mexico's CONCACAF Gold Cup victory in 2009, and participated in the 2010 FIFA World Cup in South Africa. Vela rejected all subsequent call-ups {{for more than three}} years, including friendlies, World Cup qualifiers and various major tournaments including the 2014 World Cup, citing various reasons for <b>his</b> <b>refusals.</b> In November 2014, Vela made his return to the national team.|$|R

5|$|James Maurice Kilburn (8 July 1909 – 28 August 1993) was a British sports {{journalist}} who {{wrote for the}} Yorkshire Post between 1934 and 1976. Well-regarded for the style of his writing and <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to write about off-field events, Kilburn wrote primarily about Yorkshire County Cricket Club. After a brief career in teaching, and having spent time in Finland, Kilburn was appointed cricket correspondent at the Yorkshire Post after impressing the editor with his writing. A serious man, he had an unusual way of writing his reports, but his editors refused to change his copy, so highly did they value his impact.|$|E
5|$|Jobs rants to {{marketing}} executive Joanna Hoffman about a Time magazine article exposing his paternity dispute with ex-girlfriend Chrisann Brennan – he denies {{he is the}} father of Brennan's five-year-old daughter, Lisa. Brennan arrives with Lisa to confront him – she is bitter over his denials and <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to support her despite his wealth. Jobs bonds with Lisa over her MacPaint art and agrees to provide more money and a house. Apple co-founder Steve Wozniak asks Jobs to acknowledge the Apple II team in his presentation, but Jobs feels that mentioning the computer (which he considers obsolete) is unwise.|$|E
5|$|Knott was disbarred {{and briefly}} imprisoned for <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> {{to take the}} oath of allegiance. He {{returned}} to Kentucky in 1863 and {{was elected to the}} U.S. House of Representatives. In 1871, he made a notable speech ridiculing a bill to subsidize westward expansion of railroads. In the speech, he lampooned the remote town of Duluth, Minnesota. The Duluth speech was eventually reprinted in several publications and brought Knott national acclaim. He did not stand for re-election in 1870, instead making a failed run for the office of governor. In 1875, he returned to the House and served as chair of the judiciary committee.|$|E

5|$|Morehead {{returned}} {{to his home in}} Louisville, but feared <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to take an oath of allegiance to the Constitution would lead to another arrest. In June 1862, he fled to Canada, then to Europe, and finally to Mexico. Following the war, Morehead {{returned to}} the United States and lived on his plantation in Greenville, Mississippi. He died there on December 21, 1868 and was buried on the grounds. On May 31, 1879, he was reburied in the Frankfort Cemetery in Frankfort, Kentucky.|$|E
5|$|On September 20, 2007, federal {{prosecutors}} charged the Jew with {{one count of}} mail fraud in connection with extorting $80,000 from Quickly. Jew denied any wrongdoing. He questioned what influence he could have over the issuing of permits, and reiterated <b>his</b> <b>refusal</b> to resign his position, despite insistence from Mayor Gavin Newsom. On November 7, 2007, {{a federal grand jury}} added five felony charges, including two counts each of bribery and mail fraud and one count of extortion. He was also accused of accepting $4,000 in cash from the owner of another local business, Wonderful Desserts and Cafe. Jew pleaded not guilty to all charges.|$|E

Kentucky cast its 12 votes for Boyd, bringing his third-place total to 33 votes. Seeing Breckinridge's strength on the first ballot, large numbers of delegates voted for him on the second ballot, {{and those who did not}} soon saw that his nomination was inevitable and changed their votes to make it unanimous.|$|E

He was also named a delegate by Honduras. In spite of <b>his</b> <b>refusals,</b> he attended the assembly in León, Nicaragua. On January 9, 1851 he attended another session at Chinandega, where he was named secretary of the assembly.|$|R
