40|$|The {{development}} {{of knowledge and}} learning {{in the field of}} Construction Management (CM) has national significance for construction industries around the globe. Wing (1997) provides a broad definition of CM as ‘project management, construction economics, design economics, cost engineering, value engineering, construction law and procurement, industrial management and public policy related to the construction industry’. An efficient and effective construction industry requires a knowledge bank as a catalyst for continuous improvement. The dissemination of contemporary empirical based research offers fuel to stoke the boiler and the publication of scientific ‘and’ management journals partially fulfils this role. Journals also provide a historical time line of ‘fashions and fads’ within our construction industry and more recently an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>priority</b> areas where funding councils have sponsored what is deemed to be ‘appropriate research’. Fitzgerald and Gunter (2008) point out that academic journals are the most visible manifestation of the intellectual boundaries that are established, perpetuated and maintained by its field members...|$|E

40|$|Background and Aim: Safety {{climate is}} a {{psychological}} phenomenon and a sub-component of safety culture, {{which is usually}} reflected in the shared workforce's perceptions {{about the state of}} safety at any particular time. It can provide an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the <b>priority</b> <b>of</b> safety in an organization with regard to other priorities such as production or quality. The objective {{of this study was to}} assess the safety climate profile in a steel manufacturing plant in Iran and using the results to improve the level of safety. Materials and Methods: In this cross-sectional study, the UK Loughborough University Safety Climate Assessment Toolkit was used to assess the safety climate in a steel-manufacturing industry in Iran. Information was collected through interviews and questionnaires, focus group discussions, and direct observations in the filed. Safety climate scores were calculated in 17 themes. Results: A graphic representation of the safety climate scores obtained showed that safety climate in the company is at the medium level (4. 80 ± 2). The highest and lowest scores were for dimensions <b>of</b> personal <b>priority</b> and need for safety (8. 6 ± 0. 8) and accidents and incidents (1 ± 0. 00). A non-significant correlation was found between worker's education and work experience on the one hand and their attitude towards safety on the other hand (p> 0. 05). Both management commitment and personal priority were associated with the workers' age (p= 0. 03 and 0. 02, respectively), while work environment was associated only with employment status (p = 0. 04). Conclusion: Safety climate assessment can be a proactive safety performance indicator used to improve the level of safety in an organisation...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Autistic {{individuals}} commonly show circumscribed or “special” interests: {{areas of}} obsessive {{interest in a}} specific category. The present study investigated what impact these interests have on attention, an aspect of autistic cognition often reported as altered. In neurotypical individuals, interest and expertise {{have been shown to}} result in an automatic attentional priority for related items. Here, we examine whether this change in salience is also seen in autism. Methods Adolescents and young adults with and without autism performed a personalized selective attention task assessing the level <b>of</b> attentional <b>priority</b> afforded to images related to the participant’s specific interests. In addition, participants performed a similar task with generic images in order to isolate any effects of interest and expertise. Crucially, all autistic and non-autistic individuals recruited for this study held a strong passion or interest. As such, any differences in attention could not be solely attributed to differing prevalence of interests in the two groups. In both tasks, participants were asked to perform a central target-detection task while ignoring irrelevant distractors (related or unrelated to their interests). The level of distractor interference under various task conditions was taken as an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> attentional <b>priority.</b> Results Neurotypical individuals showed the predicted attentional priority for the circumscribed interest images but not generic items, reflecting the impact of their interest and expertise. Contrary to predictions, autistic individuals did not show this priority: processing the interest-related stimuli only when task demands were low. Attention to images unrelated to circumscribed interests was equivalent in the two groups. Conclusions These results suggest that despite autistic individuals holding an intense interest in a particular class of stimuli, there may be a reduced impact of this prior experience and expertise on attentional processing. The implications of this absence <b>of</b> automatic <b>priority</b> are discussed in terms of the behaviors associated with the condition...|$|R

40|$|Objective. This paper {{describes}} {{the perceptions of}} operating theatre staff in Australia and The Netherlands regarding the influence of logistical or operational reasons that may affect the scheduling of unplanned surgical cases. It is proposed that logistical or operational issues can influence the <b>priority</b> determination <b>of</b> queue position of surgical cases on the emergency waiting list. Methods. A questionnaire was developed and conducted in 15 hospitals across The Netherlands and Australia, targeting anaesthetists, managers, nurses and surgeons. Statistical analyses revolved around these four professional groups. Six hypotheses were then developed and tested based on the responses collected from the participants. Results. There were significant differences in perceptions of logistics delay factors across different professional groups when patients were waiting for unplanned surgery. There were also significant differences among different groups when setting logistical priority factors for planning and scheduling unplanned cases. The hypotheses tests confirm these differences, and the findings concur with the paradigmatic differences mentioned in the literature. These paradigmatic differences among the four professional groups may {{explain some of the}} tensions encountered when making decisions about scheduling emergency surgical queues, and therefore should be taken into consideration for management of operating theatres. Conclusions. Queue positions of patients waiting for unplanned surgery, or emergency surgery, are determined by medical clinicians according to clinicians’ <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> clinical <b>priority.</b> However, operating theatre managers are important in facilitating smooth operations when planning for emergency surgeries. It is necessary for surgeons to understand the logistical challenges faced by managers when requesting logistical priorities for their operations.

40|$|Instructing {{personnel}} in the issues of labor protection and industrial safety at hazardous facilities {{is one of the}} main tasks that face the employer; the quality with which this procedure is organized and carried out defines not only company’s indicators, but the mere possibility of its normal functioning. The paper contains a detailed overview of the typical content of standard documentation, which is currently used when conducting operations in the oil mines of Yarega high-viscosity oil deposit. Distinct features and unique nature of this oil field require special measures to guarantee safety of personnel and all facilities in general. The author proposes and reviews an additional type of operating guidelines – instructional map of safe working methods and practices. It is more illustrative than existing documentation (charts of inclined shaft development, labor protection regulations), which allows to upgrade the process of instructing {{personnel in}} the oil mines, to improve the quality of instructions and to reduce the risk of emergencies, accidents, industrial injuries. The author reviews the structure of suggested instructional map, offers a detailed arrangement diagram for the main thematic sections of the map, as well as their content. Instructional maps are regarded as a type of operating guidelines that include: description and characteristics of equipment, instruments and appliances; general safety requirements; content and execution sequence of operational elements with their graphical images; distribution of responsibilities with an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> their <b>priority</b> in case the operations are conducted by several workers; specific safety requirements for equipment, materials, instruments, safety clothes and footwear, personal protective gear etc. (prohibitions, warnings).

40|$|Biotechnology {{companies}} are technology companies {{characterized by the}} systematic application of various types of technology. They involve the fundamentals of biochemistry, genetic engineering, physiology, microbiology, botany, zoology, and chemical engineering. The development of new products (DNP) is a characteristic of these companies. DNP is a complex process that involves several types of risks and critical success factors, especially in technology-based companies (TBCs). The key risks and sub-risks of PDP in biotechnology companies were identified and prioritized using the multi-criteria decision making method, AHP (Analytic Hierarchy Process). The result {{of the study was}} a “ranking” of the principal risks and sub-risks associated with PDP in biotechnology companies, of which market risk and financial risk were the risks most critical to PDP, followed by risks related to product requirements, manufacturing, human resources, and supplies. The main sub-risks identified were client refusal, lack of economic viability, low competitiveness, final product costing more than expected, and reduced reliability. The sub-risks that appeared less critical to PDP included low similarity of supplies, delayed delivery of inputs, high cost of inputs provided, dependence on suppliers, and high generation of waste during production. Based on these results, we obtained an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the possible <b>priorities</b> and focus <b>of</b> attention in managing risks during the product development process in a corporation...|$|R

40|$|Until 1942 {{cultivation}} of pepper P. nigrum L. in Sarawak produced relatively small but regular yields. High demands after 1945 and restricted use of "burnt earth" compelled farmers {{to abandon the}} application of this traditional fertilizer. Instead, "fool proof" manufactured fertilizers of mainly organic origin were successfully applied in massive volumes and large yields were obtained. In 1954 and following years a sharp fall in price induced a decline in production, in part owing to much reduced applications of fertilizer. As a result the economic crop cycle of some 16 years was limited to some 1 - 3 years; {{the bulk of the}} total yield was obtained {{in the first year of}} production. An initial survey on leaf symptoms and die-back indicated unbalanced and inadequate mineral nutrition of the crop. The current system induced severe deterioration of plant appearance in the period of monsoon rains, which coincide with berry expansion. During this time no fertilizers are applied as a rule. A method has been worked out to diagnose the nutritional demands of N, P, K, Ca and Mg by chemical foliar analysis. Major aspects involved in the establishment of a sampling procedure were systematically studied. The effect on chemical concentrations was investigated of the portion of the vine, the presence of fruit, the branch, the age of the leaf, the presence of the petiole, leaf size, leaf thickness, sunshine, different stems on a plant, location of fertilizer dressings and the number of leaves to be sampled per vine. Similarly, the influence of the mode of cleaning of the leaves, of the drying temperature on loss of N and the effect of length of storage on the content of N were studied. Studies on the error of bulk sampling and the effect of appropriate stratification of the different leaves in the canopy on the reduction of this error showed that suitable division into strata reduced the number of vines to be included in a bulk sample up to 16 times as compared with random sampling, assuming the same degree of precision. Furthermore the inclusion Of 4 appropriately stratified leaves from each of 60 - 70 vines in each bulk sample obtained from homogeneous areas, would represent chemical concentrations with a precision of 10 % of the population mean (P = 0. 05) irrespective of physiological condition. Data on seasonal variation indicated declining levels of N and K within the monsoon; this was accompanied by gradually rising levels of leaf P and leaf Ca. Leaf Mg tended towards constancy. Bivariate ratios showed, on most occasions, a regular relationship with time, but constant values were observed only occasionally. A sand experiment on deficiencies of nutrients showed characteristic discolourations due to nutrient shortage. Concurring foliar concentrations and ratios associated with full nutrients, partial or complete deficiency of a single element allowed tentative registration of normal, fair, critical and deficient threshold values in the leaves for each element (table 18). Single and multiple deficiencies could be recognized by using an appropriate grouping of concentrations and their ratios. Application of these values to random field data showed a satisfactory power of discrimination. The ratio values gave a good <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the order of importance in the case of multiple deficiencies. The influence was studied of dressings of NPK fertilizers on leaf concentrations and ratios. It was observed that increasing dressings of N, P, and K were directly reflected in risising concentrations of leaf N, leaf Pand leaf K, respectively. Simultaneously, N- P "antagonism" and "antagonism" between bases was also operative. Apparently, considered balancing of applications of different fertilizers is essential. The ratios between elements gave some <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> <b>priorities</b> <b>of</b> different dressings. It was also observed that under the influence of the very heavy, early applications leaf concentrations of N, K and Mg fall to deficiency levels. This indicates that the distribution in time also requires adjustment. The development of physiological exhaustion could be attributed to an inadequate net supply of N, K and Mg to the leaves during translocation processes of nutrients in the period of fruit development. Stability of yield at a high level of production can be maintained by preventing development of nutrient shortages and ensuring fair to normal concentrations of N, P, K, Ca and Mg in the leaves throughout the year. Threshold values, independently obtained from field vines corroborate the tentative values for the normal levels found in the pot experiment. The latter may therefore be considered as fundamentally correct. Rather complicated interactions of "antagonisms" and "synergisms" may become operative if foliar levels fall below these normal levels. The data have also shown convincingly that the values for log N/P can be used as a satisfactory control for abundance of flowers at a specific potential for flowering. Finally, the agricultural implications of these findings are discussed in Ch. 10. The data allowed a plausible interpretation of crop behaviour and crop performance under the traditional system of cultivation before 1942 and that in the period after 1945. By integrating the leaf data of this work with information concerning factors affecting the supply of nutrients to the plant, it was shown that foliar diagnosis furnished a suitable foundation to devise an appropriate fertilizer policy for pepper...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} {{of the study was}} to determine the value that different households attach to attributes of the dairy cow. The cow attributes were, milk yield, disease resistance, feed requirement. The valuation was done in order to quantify the economic trade-offs made during adoption of dairy technologies, assess resource availability, households perceptions on dairy technologies and their farming priorities. This was necessary to understand the adoption patterns of dairy technologies observed and suggest intervention. The Marginal Rate of Substitution (MRS), Marginal Willingness to Pay (mWTP), and Marginal Willingness to Accept (mWTA) that were used were determined from conjoint (CJ) analysis using data from a survey of 630 households in Western Kenya. The household characteristics that influenced valuation were off-farm income, precipitation over evapo-transpiration (PPE), ethnicity, cultural values, education, and extension. In reference to the typical households, household characteristics that showed a higher mWTP for a cow with low feed requirement implied either scarcity of feed, high opportunity cost of using land for fodder or lack of information on feed resources. The latter indicates inefficiency in resource use. A higher mWTP for a cow with high milk yield gave an <b>indication</b> <b>of</b> the households' <b>priorities.</b> A mWTA payment for a cow with high milk yield in the face of potential markets showed different farming <b>priorities</b> and lack <b>of</b> information.
