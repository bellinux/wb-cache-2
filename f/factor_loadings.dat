A total of 1, 338 athletes, both sexes,from various sports participated in the study; 141 were excluded.

Exploratory factor analysis revealed a factor structure that explains more than 40 % of the scale's variance. Thefinal version's items presented <b>factors</b> <b>loadings</b> greater than. 3. The Pearson correlation showed a statistically significant relationship between the DES and EAT- 26 subscales. No differences were found in the mean scores of DES in an interval of two weeks.

40|$|Purpose – The {{purpose of}} the present study is to {{identify}} the determinants that potentially influence quality education in private universities in Bangladesh. Design/methodology/approach – To attain this objective, 234 data were collected through face-to-face interviews on campus during February-March 2013 from Bachelor of Business Administration students. The bootstrapping procedure through AMOS was applied to analyze the data apart from exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis. Findings – The bootstrap path coefficients suggest that seven factors are statistically significant among the eight postulated independent variables. The outcomes of the confirmatory factor analysis, such as <b>factor</b> <b>loading's,</b> eigenvalues and percentage of variance explained, as well as reliability coefficients, are observed to conform to the results of path analysis, such as item loading's and path coefficients, which consistently increased the robustness of the study.

40|$|This {{research}} examined longitudinal measurement invariance in {{the satisfaction}} with life scale using two studies. The first followed {{a sample of}} 236 university students (93 male and 143 female) who completed the SWLS twice over a two-month interval. The second used a sample of 242 adolescent athletes (133 male and 109 female) who completed the SWLS three times {{over a period of}} six months. Confirmatory factor analysis was used to examine longitudinal measurement invariance. For the university student sample, results showed that the SWLS is partial strict invariant (equality of <b>factor</b> patterns, <b>loadings</b> and intercepts across time for all items and equality of item uniqueness for Items 1, 2, 4 and 5 across time). For the adolescent athlete student sample, the SWLS is partial strong invariant (equality of <b>factor</b> patterns, <b>loadings</b> across time for all items and equality of intercepts for Items 2, 3, and 4 across time). For both samples, stability coefficients across time were moderately high and latent factor means were not significantly different across time.

Participants completed BSHS-B. The face, content and construct validity of the scale were ascertained. Reliability was also assessed using internal consistency, construct reliability and intra-class correlation coefficient (ICC).   Results   Construct validity determined nine factors with an eigenvalue greater than 1. The model had a good fit [(c 2 (68) = 412. 038, p <. 05, c 2 /df= 4. 612, GFI =. 893, CFI =. 912, NFI =. 902, IFI =. 931, RMSEA (90 % C.

The results indicated that DOM in pore water of Yangtze estuary was very variable which mainly composed of low aromaticity and molecular weight materials. Three humic-like substances (C 1, C 2, C 4) and one protein-like substance (C 3) were identified by PARAFAC model. C 1, C 2 and C 4 exhibited same trends and were very similar. The separation of samples on both axes of the PCA showed the difference in DOM properties.

The consensus attributes of relational leadership are that the relational leader is caring, empowering, ethical, inclusive and has vision. These characteristics also reflect the newest theory and view of leadership in the psychological literature as well. Approach: For each of these 5 attributes, 10 Likert items were written using a 7 point response scale. These 50 items were administered to 141 high school teachers. Five factors were found for the RLQ and the 5 items with the highest <b>factors</b> <b>loadings</b> for each attribute were retained for the confirmatory study. Results: A confirmatory study was done with 434 elementary, {{middle and high school}} teachers who also responded to the LMX leadership scale (the “known marker ” scale) and Mayer’s trust scale. The hypothesized correlations with the LMX and trust scales were obtained as were the expected factor structures. The RLQ was in general validated, but gender, teaching level and teaching experience was found to significantly influence factor structures and scores on all three instruments. Conclusion: The meaning and implications of these findings are discussed as they are important to both research on and theories of leadership. These finding also have a number of key and important policy implications in the assessment and evaluation of educational leaders from school principals to university presidents and legislative committee members. These later implications are also discussed in detail {{and in terms of the}} different model of educational leadership and policy formulation they suggest.
