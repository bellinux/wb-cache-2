5|$|The song's video {{features}} close-up {{shots of}} Beyoncé and incorporates psychedelic light effects and symmetrical filming photography. As the acoustic guitar begins playing, Beyoncé's face comes into view. She stands with {{her blond hair}} draped just below her exposed shoulders. As she intently stares into the camera, her skin glistens as though it has been coated with a honey-like and glittery substance. Turning <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> right to left, with her eyes fixed off-camera, Beyoncé starts belting out the first verse. As the chorus is reached, scenes of Beyoncé in a darkened room are shown. Additionally, she places her face delicately against dripping water, gently brushing it with her lips and palms. The scenery changes and Beyoncé {{is back in the}} darkened chamber, where she removes her dress.|$|E
25|$|In {{the cave}} {{he came upon}} the {{sleeping}} Medusa. By viewing Medusa's reflection in his polished shield, he safely approached and cut off <b>her</b> <b>head.</b> <b>From</b> her neck sprang Pegasus ("he who sprang") and Chrysaor ("sword of gold"), the result of Poseidon and Medusa's meeting. The other two Gorgons pursued Perseus, but, wearing his helm of darkness, he escaped. From here he proceeded to visit Atlas, king of Mauretania, who had refused him hospitality; in revenge Perseus turned him to stone.|$|E
25|$|The {{reproductive}} {{strategy of}} the northern two-lined salamander begins with an elaborate courtship. It may take place from September (in the southern parts of its range) to May (in the north). Observations of courtship in the species were made based on individuals held in captivity by Noble (1929), and a summary of these observations are: the male becomes restless, as if searching for a female. Upon finding the female, he will lift her by pushing his snout under her cloacal region or chest. The male adopts a distinct posture, bending his body laterally around her snout. The pair may remain in this position {{for an hour or}} more. The female eventually slips out of this posture and begins to straddle the male's tail with her fore limbs, while pressing her chin against the base of the male's tail. The male may undulate his tail from side to side in a slow and exaggerated manner, and the female moves <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> side to side, alternately from the male’s tail. This tail-straddling walk may last for over an hour, at which point the male deposits a spermatophore, leading the female to walk over it, at which time she may either accept or reject the male’s sperm. The spermatophore of this species is described as conical, 2.5mm in height and with a colorless stalk that tapers towards the tip.|$|E

500|$|The {{beginning}} of the film states that the first attack occurred on Sunday, March 3. In real life, the attack happened on Friday, February 22nd. Jimmy Hollis (portrayed as [...] "Sammy Fuller") was not {{pulled out of the}} window. The girl, Mary Jeanne Larey (portrayed as [...] "Linda Mae Jenkins") was told to run. She was then chased down and sexually assaulted with the attacker's gun. She soon escaped and received help at a house. In the film, the doctor claimed that she was bitten and chewed, but Mary Larey only had a cut on <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> being beaten.|$|E
500|$|Skírnir {{turns to}} threats; {{he points out}} to Gerðr that he holds a sword {{in his hand and}} he threatens to cut <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> her neck unless she agrees. Gerðr refuses; she says that she will not endure the {{coercion}} of any man, and says that if Gymir encounters Skírnir then a battle can be expected. Skírnir again reminds Gerðr of his blade and predicts that Gerðr's jötunn father will meet his doom with it. Skírnir warns Gerðr that he will strike her with his Gambanteinn, a wand, that it will tame her to his desires, and says that she will never again be seen by [...] "the sons of men". From early morning, Gerðr will sit on an eagle's mound, looking outward to the world, facing Hel, and that [...] "food shall be more hateful to you than to every man is the shining serpent among men".|$|E
500|$|In 1975 Bundy shifted {{much of his}} {{criminal}} activity eastward, from his base in Utah to Colorado. On January 12, a 23-year-old registered nurse named Caryn Eileen Campbell disappeared while walking down a well-lit hallway between the elevator and her room at the Wildwood Inn (now the Wildwood Lodge) in Snowmass Village, [...] southeast of Salt Lake City. Her nude body was found a month later next to a dirt road just outside the resort. She {{had been killed by}} blows to <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> a blunt instrument that left distinctive linear grooved depressions on her skull; her body also bore deep cuts from a sharp weapon. A hundred miles (160km) northeast of Snowmass, on March 15, Vail ski instructor Julie Cunningham, 26, disappeared while walking from her apartment to a dinner date with a friend. Bundy later told Colorado investigators that he approached Cunningham on crutches and asked her to help carry his ski boots to his car, where he clubbed and handcuffed her, then assaulted and strangled her at a secondary site near Rifle, Colorado, [...] west of Vail. Weeks later, he made the six-hour drive from Salt Lake City to revisit her remains.|$|E

500|$|Since his death, McCay's {{original}} artwork {{has been}} poorly preserved; much {{was destroyed in}} a late-1930s house fire, and more was sold off when the McCays needed money. [...] About 400original drawings from the film have been preserved, discovered by animator Robert Brotherton in disarray in the fabric shop of Irving Mendelsohn, into whose care McCay's films and artwork had been entrusted in the 1940s. Besides some cels from The Sinking of the Lusitania, these Gertie drawings are the only original animation artwork of McCay's to have survived. [...] McCay destroyed many of his original cans of film to create more storage space. [...] Of what he kept, much has not survived, as it was photographed on 35mm nitrate film, which deteriorates and is highly flammable in storage. [...] A pair of young animators discovered the film in 1947 and preserved what they could. [...] In many cases only fragments could be saved, if anything at all. [...] Of all of McCay's films, Gertie is the best preserved. [...] Mendelsohn and Brotherton tried fruitlessly to find an institution to store McCay's films until the Canadian film conservatory the Cinémathèque québécoise approached them in 1967 {{on the occasion of}} that year's World Animation Film Exposition in Montreal. [...] The Cinémathèque québécoise has since curated McCay's films. [...] Of the surviving drawings, fifteen have been determined not to appear in extant copies of the film. [...] They appear to come from a single sequence, likely {{at the close of the}} film, and have Gertie showing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> the audience's right and giving a bow.|$|E

She is a jiangshi (hopping zombie); she often points out her undead status with the catchphrase [...] "After all, I'm dead" [...] or by removing <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> her body. She summons other jiangshi, as demonstrated during the school's sports day. As the apprentice of Tohofuhai, she {{can use the}} Dimension Sword technique, but as a strategist to the Huang family she resorts to other weapons and methods to defeat her opponent.|$|E
2500|$|After Corday's decapitation, a {{man named}} Legros lifted <b>her</b> <b>head</b> <b>from</b> the basket and slapped it on the cheek. Charles-Henri Sanson, the executioner, indignantly {{rejected}} published reports that Legros {{was one of his}} assistants. Sanson stated in his diary that Legros was in fact a carpenter who had been hired to make repairs to the guillotine. Witnesses report an expression of [...] "unequivocal indignation" [...] on her face when her cheek was slapped. The oft-repeated anecdote has served to suggest that victims of the guillotine may in fact retain consciousness for a short while, including by Albert Camus in his Reflections on the Guillotine. ("Charlotte Corday's severed head blushed, it is said, under the executioner's slap.").|$|E
