In the past {{he had been able to}} “feel twilight gather” but something has changed and he’s no longer as sure as he once was. It appears that these two have been abandoned or forgotten when the populous fled the area. Sometimes he thinks he hears people and wonders if they are coming back.|$|E

What <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> mean? Much {{of the album}} is suffused with sarcasm: right from the disaffected ennui of the title track to the stroppiness of 'Nobody Knows Me', Madonna is kicking against the claustrophobic effect of celebrity worship." ...|$|E

Lopez stated that: [...] "He's awesome. He's one of the nicest people and has a beautiful spirit. He can create something the whole world will love and that is probably to do with his international background. Some people can do dance, others can do urban or pop, but Nadir <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> and understand what makes a hit on every level".|$|E

Lopez and Gaga did not work on the song together in person. According to Lopez, RedOne brought Gaga into the process because they have worked together a lot in the past.

500|$|Rettenmund complimented {{the video}} saying [...] "God Bless ... One of Madonna's worst {{performing}} singles was nonetheless given {{one of her}} best videos... Simply staged, it is equal parts funny and sexy... If its possible for one video to sum up Madonna's Madonna-ness, 'Human Nature' is that video". Louis Virtel from The Backlot ranked the video at number 22 on a list for [...] "Madonna's 55 Best Videos", and called it [...] "tongue-in-cheek, pleather-heavy". He {{went on to say}} that [...] "It's rare that Madonna gets a chance to be both harsh and hilarious in a music video", and in this one, [...] "Madonna basically does whatever the hell she wants. Brandish a chihuahua? Mock and celebrate kinkiness? Sneer at the camera like a bored third-grader? She <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>all,</b> and even in black cornrows, she's a vision of coolness and sexual superiority". Carol Vernallis, writer of Experiencing Music Video: Aesthetics and Cultural Context noted that the concept of black outfit against a white background [...] "works well, but the snare drum, which corresponds to nothing in the imagery, seems to float above the soundtrack".|$|E

500|$|To Playford's {{advantage}} {{there was}} usually {{a disproportionate number}} of South Australians in federal cabinets, both Liberal and Labor. This clout, combined with his own intensive and unconventional negotiating tactics, made sure that South Australia regularly received more federal funds {{than it would have been}} allocated otherwise. This was to Robert Menzies' chagrin, who said: [...] "Tom [...] wouldn't know intellectual honesty if he met it on the end of a pitch fork but he <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> for South Australia, not for himself, so I forgive him." [...] By the time of his departure from power, Playford gained the reputation of being [...] "a good South Australian but a very bad Australian", and for using [...] "threats to bully recalcitrant Prime Ministers". For his part, Playford remained unrepentant, claiming that federal authorities had infringed the constitution of Australia and had consistent exercised powers over the states that were not rightfully theirs. Playford accused the High Court of Australia of helping the federal parliament under Curtin to legislate to give itself a monopoly on the acquisition of income tax, which he claimed was contrary to the intention of the constitution to prevent excessive centralisation of power in the federal government. In 1958, he threatened to take the federal government to the High Court, which led to South Australia being given more compensation under the River Murray Waters Agreement for the loss of water from the Snowy River. Three years later he went to the High Court in an attempt to have Canberra pay for the standardisation of the gauge on the Broken Hill-Port Pirie railway.|$|E
2500|$|After the race, his Jockey Tom Queally said: [...] "Every moment {{spent on}} Frankel's back {{is a special}} moment. He is amazing and had all the others cooked at halfway. It was a nice prep for his next race. He is a class apart from any other horse around and <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> very easily... Turning into the straight, I slipped him an inch of rein.

[...] He could thereby more easily give his performers a cinematic showcase for their abilities and help them deepen their acting contribution. Actor Christopher Reeve, who co-starred in Deathtrap, {{also pointed out that}} Lumet knew how to talk technical language: [...] "If you want to work that way– he knows how to talk Method, he knows how to improvise, and he <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> equally well." ...|$|E

2500|$|Luke {{was written}} {{to be read}} aloud {{to a group of}} Jesus-followers {{gathered}} in a house to share the Lord's supper.

He begins his gospel with a preface addressed to Theophilus, informing him of his intention to provide an [...] "ordered account" [...] of events which will lead his reader to [...] "certainty". He did not write in order to provide Theophilus with historical justification—"did it happen?"—but to encourage faith—"what happened, and what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> mean?" ...|$|E
2500|$|One of Crosby's songwriting {{contributions}} to the album, [...] "What's Happening?!?!", began his penchant for writing abstract songs asking irresoluble questions, a trend that has continued throughout his career with Crosby, Stills & Nash and as a solo artist. During a 1966 interview, Crosby admitted {{that it was a}} strange song, noting [...] "It asks questions of what's going on here and who <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> belong to and why is it all going on. I just ask the questions because I really don't know the answers." [...] Like [...] "Eight Miles High", the song exhibits the strong influence of Indian classical music with its droning guitar and melody. [...] "What's Happening?!?!" [...] is also notable for being the first song written solely by Crosby to appear on a Byrds' record.|$|E
2500|$|As {{various other}} critics do, Michael Coveney is still asking: [...] "Yes, but what <b>does</b> <b>it</b> <b>all</b> mean? Kenneth Tynan railed against the 'gratuitous obscurity' of Harold Pinter's poetic 1975 play {{when it was}} first {{produced}} by Peter Hall at the National starring John Gielgud as the supplicant versifier Spooner and Ralph Richardson as his host Hirst, patron and supporter of the arts. But the play is always gloriously enjoyable as an off-kilter vaudeville of friendship and dependency." [...] In The Guardian, Billington concludes that [...] "This is a compelling revival much aided by Neil Austin's lighting and Adam Cork's subliminal sound," [...] observing: [...] "when audience and cast finally joined in applauding Pinter, [...] seated in a box, I felt it was in recognition of an eerily disturbing play that transports us into a world somewhere between reality and dream." ...|$|E

[...] Clashs Luke Winstanley wrote, [...] "Music for People in Trouble takes more creative risks than its predecessor, and though this may deter some, it proves to be a decision that pays off. Far from diminishing the project, the end product is another outstanding record, executed with fearlessness and grace." [...] Spectrum Cultures John Paul praised the album, writing, [...] "Music for People in Trouble is nothing short of a personal and professional triumph for Susanne Sundfør." ...|$|E
