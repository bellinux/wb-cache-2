5|$|Late in 1975, EMI/Capitol {{had issued}} greatest-hits {{collections}} on the Apple Records imprint for Lennon and Starr – Shaved Fish and Blast <b>from</b> <b>Your</b> Past, respectively. Since Lennon and Starr were still nominally Apple artists, they each had {{input into the}} content and packaging of their solo compilation, and Lennon, in particular, was active in promoting his album. Shaved Fish and Blast <b>from</b> <b>Your</b> Past sold reasonably well, in America, but their sales failed to match record-company expectations. For Harrison, there had been long delays between releases following the international success of his All Things Must Pass triple album in 1970–71, due first to {{his commitment to the}} Bangladesh humanitarian aid project and later to his production work for Dark Horse Records acts Splinter and Ravi Shankar. Harrison issued his final studio album for Apple in the autumn of 1975, Extra Texture (Read All About It). As a result, by the time that Capitol came to prepare a compilation of his solo work the following year, he had effectively surrendered all artistic control over its content.|$|E

5|$|A Roy of the Rovers {{computer}} game was released, on the Commodore 64, Amstrad CPC and ZX Spectrum in 1988. It was {{split into two}} parts: the first an adventure game, in which– taking the role of Roy Race– the player had to find and rescue the kidnapped Melchester team, before then playing the second part, which consisted of a charity match {{to raise funds for}} the club. The fewer players recovered before the match began, then the smaller the team who could take part. In the extreme, Roy would be the only player for Melchester. The game received mixed reactions; the Spectrum version received 7/10 <b>from</b> <b>Your</b> Sinclair, but only 3/10 from Sinclair User.|$|E
5|$|Adomnán in his Life of Saint Columba {{offers a}} longer account, which Abbot Ségéne {{had heard from}} Oswald himself. Oswald, he says, {{had a vision of}} Columba the night before the battle, in which he was toldBe strong and act manfully. Behold, I will be with thee. This coming night go out <b>from</b> <b>your</b> camp into battle, for the Lord has granted me that at this time your foes shall be put to flight and Cadwallon your enemy shall be {{delivered}} into your hands and you shall return victorious after battle and reign happily. Oswald described his vision to his council and all agreed that they would be baptised and accept Christianity after the battle. In the battle that followed, the British were routed despite their superior numbers; Cadwallon himself was killed.|$|E
