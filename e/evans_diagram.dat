In such hybrid structures, where metal and composite are closely in contact, {{the strength of the}} interface between the metal and the composite can be altered by the galvanic corrosion between the aluminium and the composite when Carbon Fibres Reinforced Plastic (CFRP) is used. This paper is related to the corrosion and mechanical properties of an Aluminium/CFRP co-cured hybrid structure. The influence of the aluminium surface treatment on the interface properties obtained after a one step co-curing manufacturing process has been assessed. Al- 2024 aluminium alloy treated by either tartaric-sulphuric anodizing (TSA), chromic acid anodizing (CAA) or silane pre-treatment (γ-GPS) has been used and co-cured with CFRP. The galvanic corrosion behaviour of the Al/CFRP hybrid system has been determined with the <b>Evans</b> <b>diagram</b> method and the mechanical strength of the interface has been characterized with a single-lap joint tensile test before and after exposure of the samples in a salt spray chamber. The different surface treatments of the aluminium alloy have been compared in term of both galvanic corrosion and adhesion properties before and after corrosive environment exposure in order to find the best compromise for Al/CFRP structure applications...|$|E

40|$|This paper {{describes}} the chemical nature {{of concrete and}} the internal {{environment in which the}} steel reinforcement is situ-ated. The electrochemical basis for passivity of iron in aqueous solution is discussed and the anodic and cathodic reactions which occur are detailed in relation to pH-potential (Pourbaix) and current-potential (<b>Evans)</b> <b>diagrams.</b> The observed behaviour of iron in solution is compared to the behaviour of reinforcement in concrete. The breakdown of the passive film is discussed in relation to the commonly observed causes of deterioration of reinforced concrete i. e. carbonation of concrete, the presence of chloride ions at the steel surface and sulphate attack. Results of an SEM-EDS study of chloride-induced breakdown of the passive film are presented. The effects of the surface condition of the re-inforcement prior to its inclusion in concrete and the use of latent hydraulic binders and thermosetting plastic coatings (fusion bonded epoxy) in relation to passivity and corrosion behaviour are discussed. shear and tensile stresses. Reinforced concrete is there-fore a composite material, the components of which have different durability requirements. It is well known that mild steel (normally used as reinforcement) exposed to the atmosphere in temperate climates will readily corrode to produce orange/red rust (Fe 2 Oa. H 20), which is accompanied by a large in-crease in volume (Leeming 1989), up to ten times that of the original metal (see Fig. 1). If corrosion takes place inside concrete, tensile stresses are induced which ultimately result in cracking and spalling of the cover. The continued use of reinforced concrete suggests that, in the majority of structures erious corrosion of the reinforcement is not a problem. Chemistry and microstructure of concret...|$|R
40|$|The recent {{trend for}} {{aerospace}} and automotive applications is aimed to improve both, weight saving and safety {{performance of their}} structural components. Therefore, lightweight material with high strength per weight ratio is required. Aluminium and CFRP are competing materials for lightweight structural components. These two materials can be combined forming hybrid material {{in order to promote}} their advantages. In practical situations, this hybrid material is exposed to different corroding environments, for example fuel or salt solutions. The major concern regarding the use of this hybrid material is the galvanic corrosion of aluminium in contact with CFRP. This galvanic contact may lead to dangerous pitting corrosion. In the present work, the galvanic corrosion of aluminium in contact with CFRP in chloride solutions is investigated. One simple way is the investigation by optical microscopy of the surface morphology after long time immersion. Another way is studying the electrochemical behaviour (active, passive, and pitting behaviour) of aluminium and CFRP separately by means of polarization and electrochemical Noise (EN) methods. Then the use of these electrochemical techniques can be combined in order to predict the galvanic behaviour of this hybrid material. The results from literature can often not be compared because of different measurement parameters. Therefore, systematic and scientific measurements with constant measurement parameters have been carried out for better understanding. Firstly, the experiments deal with aluminium, because its electrochemical behaviour is much more complex compared to the more simple CFRP. It was observed that systematic study was possible because of controlled sample preparation and measurement set-up. Active Surface of pure aluminium could be prepared the first time. For scan rate 0 (potentiostatic), {{there seemed to be no}} difference between metastable and stable pitting corrosion of pure aluminium. Moreover, long time noise measurements with high sampling rate were necessary for real analysis. Pitting transients could be identified and analysed by frequency. The polarization results have been compared with analysis of <b>Evans</b> <b>diagrams.</b> It was found that pitting corrosion of aluminium could be induced through galvanic contact with CFRP and the pitting corrosion started at the boundary of carbon and aluminium. In addition, the galvanic corrosion depends on surface area ratio of CFRP to aluminium and immersion time...|$|R
50|$|Hierarchical {{multiple}} star systems {{with more than}} three stars can produce a number of more complicated arrangements, which can be illustrated by what Evans (1968) has called a mobile diagram. These are similar to ornamental mobiles hung from the ceiling. Some examples {{can be seen in}} the figure to the right. Each level of the diagram illustrates the decomposition of the system into two or more systems with smaller size. <b>Evans</b> calls a <b>diagram</b> multiplex if there is a node with more than two children, i.e. if the decomposition of some subsystem involves two or more orbits with comparable size. Because, as we have already seen for triple stars, this may be unstable, {{multiple star}}s are expected to be simplex, meaning that at each level there are exactly two children. Evans calls the number of levels in the diagram its hierarchy.|$|R
40|$|Sulphide stress {{corrosion}} cracking, (SSCC) {{is one of}} the major problems encountered by the petroleum industry throughout the world. The problem is likely to increase in severity for the North Sea oil and gas industries as the fields get older and platforms are moved to deeper waters. This is because the hydrogen sulphide concentration increases as the fields get older and deeper water explorations require higher strength steels. The protective measures taken at present to combat SSCC are not adequate. Therefore a novel method was developed to inhibit SSCC in steel. This method is based on using an active hydrogen evolution sulphide electro-catalyst, more active than steel, as a coat on the surface of the steel, such that the hydrogen evolution will take place on the catalyst surface, instead of on the corroding steel surface. Therefore, the amount of hydrogen diffusing through the steel is greatly reduced. Hence, SSCC in the steel is effectively inhibited. Electrochemical and mechanical experimental studies were carried out to confirm the validity of this method A computer-aided literature survey on SSCC and its prevention in oil- and gas-well equipment is presented. The viability of three sulphide electro-catalysts, NiCo₂S₄, MoS₂ and WS₂ for this method were studied in various experiments, namely, electrochemical polarization, hydrogen diffusion studies and corrosion weight loss measurements. The experimental studies carried out in NACE solution, consisting of a 5 percent (mass/volume) NaCl and 0. 5 percent (volume/volume) acetic acid, with a continuous flow of H₂S at 1 atmospheric pressure, indicated that hydrogen evolution performances are in the following order: in the absence of H₂S, NiCo₂, S₄ > WS₂, > MoS₂> EN 42 steel in the presence of H₂S, MoS₂> WS₂> NiCo₂S₄> EN 42 steel MoS₂was found to be the most stable catalyst in the sour corrosive environment. <b>Evans</b> <b>diagrams,</b> constructed to predict corrosion rates, indicate that the corrosion current ratio of the MoS₂ - EN 42 steel couple and EN 42 steel did not change significantly when the catalyst loading was reduced. The hydrogen diffusion studies confirmed that an MoS₂/ FEP (fluoro ethylene polymer) adherent coat with higher catalyst to FEP ratio was the most effective of three adherent coats. The corrosion weight loss measurements showed that the corrosion rates of steel coupons partially coated with MoS₂/ FEP coat were higher than those of uncoated coupons for up to 50 hours but thereafter they reduced significantly below those of uncoated coupons. Mechanical studies carried out to eväluate the effectiveness of this method were helped by a literature survey on {{stress corrosion}} test methods and interpretation of results. Slower straining/loading rate tests and sustained load tests were selected to study the changes in various mechanical parameters on different types of specimens when protected with MoS₂ / FEP coat. In addition to these tests, Charpy impact tests were also carried out. The mechanical parameters measured on the specimens are: a) for compact tension specimens - stress intensity factor at failure - total energy required for fracturing the specimen - average energy consumed for unit length of crack extension - crack opening displacement - crack growth rate - time to failure b) for three-point bend specimens - crack opening displacement c) for Charpy V-notch impact test specimens - fracture energy All these mechanical parameters confirm the effectiveness of the MoS₂ / FEP coat to inhibit SSCC in steel. Scanning electron microscopic examinations of the specimens also confirmed the viability of the novel protective method. The sour-corrosion fatigue tests showed that the MoS₂ / FEP coat could be used effectively in environments where a cyclic loading pattern is inevitable. These studies confirm that the proposed protective technique could be used effectively in the oil and gas industries to inhibit SSCC...|$|R
500|$|In 1783, two of Evans's {{brothers}} {{began building}} a mill in Newport {{on part of}} the family's farm estate which they purchased from their father, and Evans was recruited to oversee its construction on the Red Clay Creek. When the mill opened in 1785 it was of a conventional design, {{but over the next}} five years Evans began to experiment with inventions to reduce the reliance upon labor for milling. Moving wheat from the bottom to the top of the mill to begin the process was the most onerous task of all in contemporary mills. Evans's first innovation was a bucket elevator to facilitate this process. Chains of buckets to raise water was a Roman technology had been used in various guises since antiquity. <b>Evans</b> had seen <b>diagrams</b> of their use for marine applications and realized with some modification and careful engineering they could be used to raise grain, so a series of bucket elevators around a mill could move grain and flour from one process to the next. Another labor-intensive task was that of spreading meal. This came out of the grinding process warm and moist, needing cooling and drying before it could be sifted and packed. Traditionally the task was done by manually shoveling meal across large floors. In response, Evans developed the [...] "hopper boy", a device which gathered meal from a bucket elevator and spread it evenly over the drying floor—a mechanical rake would revolve around the floorspace. [...] This would even out newly deposited meal for cooling and drying, while a gentle incline in the design of the rake blades would slowly move the flour towards central chutes, from which the material would be sifted. Used in conjunction, the two innovations saved many hours of labor and greatly reduced the risk of contamination.|$|R
