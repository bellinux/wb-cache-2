5000|$|The {{solution}} {{came from}} Colonel [...] "Dick" [...] Taylor, an Illinois businessman {{serving as a}} volunteer officer.

5|$|The first {{shooting}} medals {{were struck}} {{in honor of}} the Officers' Shoot held in Langenthal, Bern, in 1822. They can usually be distinguished from shooting thalers by their lack of denomination and difference in weight and often composition, though there is evidence that many of thaler-size did circulate amongst the <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>coins</b> of Switzerland. Shooting medals were minted in a variety of metals, including silver, bronze, goldene and white metal.|$|R

25|$|Originally {{part of the}} State Department, the Mint {{was made}} an {{independent}} agency in 1799.

50|$|San Marino is an enclave {{completely}} within Italy. With {{little or}} no resources, the tiny nation has made income selling stamps and coins to tourists.

Along with collecting coins, the department also maintains a large collection of medals. At present day, the National Museum contains approximately half-a million objects.|$|R
50|$|The doubloons thrown {{during the}} parade are inexpensive, stamped {{anodized}} aluminum. However, a thriving cottage industry has {{developed for the}} production and collection of limited edition doubloons. As a means of fundraising, many societies now offer limited edition doubloons struck from bronze, silver, gold and platinum. Other offerings include cloisonné and hand-painted varieties. Rather than being stamped, these pieces are struck like <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>coins.</b> The Resurrected Cowbellion de Rakin Society struck what {{has become the most}} unusual coins in Mobile Carnival history - the Belldallion - doubloons struck {{in the shape of a}} cowbell.|$|R

50|$|New Zealand has {{a complex}} history of <b>legal</b> <b>tender.</b> English law applied, as {{applicable}} to local circumstances, from either 6 January 1840, when the Governor of New South Wales by proclamation annexed New Zealand, or from 14 January 1840 when Captain Hobson Royal Navy {{was sworn in}} as Lieutenant-Governor. The English Laws Act 1858 subsequently confirmed that English legislation passed prior to 14 January 1840 was and had been the law of New Zealand, as applicable to local circumstances. The (UK) Coinage Act 1816 therefore applied and British coins were confirmed as <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> in New Zealand. Unusually, until 1989, the Reserve Bank did {{not have the right to}} issue <b>coins</b> as <b>legal</b> <b>tender.</b> <b>Coins</b> had to be issued by the Minister of Finance.|$|R
5000|$|The Coinage Act of 1873, {{enacted by}} the United States Congress in 1873, embraced the gold {{standard}} and de-monetized silver. Western mining interests and others who wanted silver in circulation labeled this measure the [...] "Crime of '73". For about five years, gold was the only metallic standard in the United States until passage of the Bland-Allison Act on February 28, 1878, requiring the US Treasury to purchase domestic silver bullion to be minted into <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> <b>coins</b> co-existent with gold coins. Silver Certificate Series 1878 was issued to join the gold certificates already in circulation.|$|R

40|$|The Massachusetts {{currency}} of 1690 {{was the first}} inconvertible paper money to be supported solely by a <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> law. The circumstances that led to its creation exceed the typical story of wartime specie shortage. Due to temporary political constraints of that turbulent period, the currency could be neither backed by land nor granted a <b>full</b> <b>legal</b> <b>tender</b> status, as was then standard. Instead, {{it had to be}} disguised from England as a simple, private-like IOU. By pleasing both its pay-demanding troops and England, the government maximized its probability of survival subject to the constraints. ...|$|R
