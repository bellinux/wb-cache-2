40|$|Chapitre 12 The {{transport}} {{tubes of}} the phloem {{are essential for}} higher plants. They not only provide the route for the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilates</b> produced during photosynthesis from source to sink organs but also (re-) distribute mineral nutrients. Additionally, the phloem is essential for sending information between distant plant organs and steering developmental and defense processes. For example, flowering and tuberization time are controlled by phloem-mobile signals and important defense reactions on the whole plant level, like systemic acquired resistance or systemic gene silencing, are spread through the phloem. In addition, recent results demonstrate that also the allocation of mineral nutrients is coordinated by phloem mobile signaling molecules. However, in many studies the important analysis of phloem sap is neglected, probably because the content of sieve tubes {{is not easy to}} access. This chapter will describe the current methods for sampling and analysis of phloem sap in order to encourage researchers to include the analysis of this crucial compartment in their relevant studies...|$|E
40|$|Emmer wheat (Triticum diccocum Schrank) {{belonged to}} the most {{frequent}} species of cereals in the past. Nowadays, it is grown in arid and montane areas in particular. Interest in this cereal species has increased, as it is tolerant to biotic and abiotic stressing factors. Therefore, yield parameters were evaluated in three-year (2007, 2008 and 2010) trials that were carried out in two different localities in the Czech Republic. Results of the research were compared to characteristics of four old and two top modern bread wheat (Triticum aestivum L.) cultivars. The emmer wheat varieties were resistant to usual wheat diseases. They formed their yield by a quantity of productive tillers (2. 5), whereas the varieties of bread wheat had less productive tillers (1. 5) per one plant. The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilates</b> was worse in the emmer wheat plants and it provoked a lower harvest index (0. 33) there.

40|$|AbstractSucrose is {{the primary}} product of {{photosynthetic}} CO 2 fixation that {{is used for the}} <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilated</b> carbon within higher plants. Its partitioning from the site of synthesis to different sites of storage, conversion into other storage compounds or metabolic degradation involves various steps of cell-to-cell movement and transport. Many of these steps occur within symplastic domains, i. e. sucrose moves passively cell-to-cell through plasmodesmata. Some essential steps, however, occur between symplastically isolated cells or tissues. In these cases, sucrose is transiently released into the apoplast and its cell-to-cell transport depends on the activity of plasma membrane-localized, energy dependent, H+-symporting carrier proteins. This paper reviews the current knowledge of sucrose transporter physiology and molecular biology...|$|R
40|$|The {{physiological}} aspects {{involved in}} the Uniconazol-induced morphological changes in Zinnia elegans Jacq. cv Red Sun were clarified biochemically by determining the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilated</b> 13 C {{as well as the}} soluble acid invertase activity. The application of Uniconazol, (E) - 1 -(4 -chlorophenyl) - 4, 4 -dimethyl- 2 -(1, 2, 4 -triazol- 1 -yl) - 1 -pentane- 3 -ol, reduced the growth of stems and leaves without affecting the roots. In addition, the translocation <b>of</b> <b>assimilated</b> 13 C from leaf to other organs was inhibited, with the stem being more restricted than the root. These changes were matched by a corresponding decrease in the specific activity of soluble acid invertase. Subsequent treatment of GA 3 counteracted these effects of Uniconazol. Moreover, the total and reducing sugar content was closely correlated with the soluble acid invertase activity in the stem. It is concluded that the reduction in invertase activity of stem is a biochemical manifestation of the retardation of stem growth induced by Uniconazol...|$|R

Phosphate translocator activity in intact chloroplasts isolated from transformed plants showed a 15 -fold variation, from 20 % of the wild-type activity in antisense transformants to 300 % of the wild-type activity in sense transformants. However, the maximal rates of photosynthesis and the rates of photosynthetic carbon assimilation in ambient CO 2 showed no consistent differences between transformants. Starch content was decreased by 20 % and total soluble sugars were increased by 20 % in leaves of antisense transformants compared to sense transformants. The 40 % decrease in the ratio of starch to total soluble sugars in antisense transformants relative to sense transformants indicates that <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilate</b> between starch and sugar had been altered.

Based on 14 C phosphor imaging, we visualized the allocation of assim-ilates into Lolium perenne roots and estimated the life time of hotspots at the root tips. Lolium shoots were labeled in a 14 CO 2 atmosphere, and herbariums of roots and shoots were prepared 6 h, 2 d, and 11 d after the 14 C pulse. The 14 C distribution in roots and leaves revealed that pulse labeling does not yield homogeneously labeled plant material. The spatial <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilate</b> allocation was evaluated based on the 14 C specific activity expressed as digital light units (DLU mm– 2) of the imaging plates. Areas with high relative 14 C activity were classified as hotspots.

Eleven days after the 14 C assimilation, the hotspots at the root tips disappeared and the 14 C distribution was much more even than after 6 h or after 2 d. 14 C phosphor imaging proved to be a promising tool to visualize the allocation of photoassimi-lates into {{the roots and}} the rhizosphere and can be used to identify hotspots and their dynamics...|$|R
40|$|Assimilate {{partitioning}} was {{studied in}} the common pea (Pisum sativum L.) by feeding 14 CO 2 to whole plants and measuring radioactivity in different organs 48 hours after labeling. Two experimental protocols were used. For the first, one reproductive node was darkened with an aluminum foil, to prevent photosynthesis during labeling. The aim was to study assimilate translocation among nodes. The second was carried out to assess any priority among sinks. Whole plants were shaded, during labeling, to reduce carbon assimilation. Various developmental stages between the onset of flowering and the final stage in seed abortion of the last pod were chosen for labeling. When all photosynthetic structures at the first reproductive node were darkened at any stage of development after {{the formation of the}} first flower, the first pod was supplied with assimilates from other nodes. In contrast, later developed pods, when photosynthetic structures at their node were darkened, received assimilates from other nodes only when they were beyond their final stage in seed abortion. Reducing illumination to 30 % did not change <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilated</b> carbon between vegetative and reproductive structures, nor among pods.

When the plant was growing actively, following the start of the reproductive phase until {{a few days before the}} end of flowering, the top of the plant (i. e., all the organs above the last opened flower) had a higher sink strength and a higher relative specific activity than pods, suggesting that it was a more competitive sink for <b>assimilates.</b> The pattern <b>of</b> <b>assimilate</b> <b>distribution</b> described here provides an explanation for pod and seed abortion...|$|R
40|$|Cadmium is a non-essential {{toxic metal}} that {{is able to}} {{bioaccumulate}} in both flora fauna and {{has the potential to}} biomagnify in some food chains. However, the form in which cadmium is presented to consumers can alter the bioavailability and possibly the internal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilated</b> Cd. Previous studies in our laboratory highlighted differences in Cd assimilation among isopods when they were provided with a plant-based food with either Cd biologically incorporated into plant tissue or superficially amended with ionic Cd(2 +). Cd is known for its high affinity for sulphur ligands in cysteine residues which form the basis for metal-binding proteins such as metallothionein. This study compares Cd assimilation efficiency (AE) in Porcellio dilatatus fed with food amended with either cadmium cysteinate or cadmium nitrate in an examination of the influence of Cd speciation on metal bioavailability followed by an examination <b>of</b> the sub-cellular <b>distribution</b> using a centrifugal fractionation protocol. As hypothesized the AE of Cd among isopods fed with Cd(NO(3)) (2) (64 %, SE = 5 %) was higher than AE for isopods fed with Cd(Cys) (2) (20 %, SE = 3 %). The sub-cellular distribution also depended on the Cd species provided. Those isopods fed Cd(Cys) (2) allocated significantly more Cd to the cell debris and organelles fractions at the expense of allocation to metal-rich granules (MRG). The significance of the difference in sub-cellular distribution with regard to toxicity is discussed.

Four alloplasmic tomato lines, containing the nuclear genome of tomato and the plastome of L. hirsutum LA 1777 Humb. & Bonpl., an accession collected at high-altitude in Peru, were reciprocally crossed with 11 tomato entries with a high inbreeding level and a wide genetic variation, resulting in a set of 44 reciprocal crosses. Irrespective of growth temperature, alloplasmic families with alien chloroplasts of L. hirsutum (h) were on average characterized by a high shoot biomass, a large leaf area, and a low specific leaf area in comparison with their euplasmic counterparts.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a complete characterization {{of a very}} deep stratospheric intrusion which occurred over the British Isles on 15 August 2007. The signature of this event is diagnosed using ozonesonde measurements over Lerwick, UK (60. 14 ° N, 1. 19 ° W) and is also well characterized using meteorological analyses from the global operational weather prediction model of Météo-France, ARPEGE. Modelled as well as <b>assimilated</b> fields <b>of</b> both ozone (O 3) and carbon monoxide (CO) {{have been used in}} order to better document this event. The paper also {{presents a}} demonstration of the capability of O 3 and CO assimilated fields to better describe a stratosphere-troposphere exchange (STE) event in comparison with the free run modelled O 3 and CO fields. O 3 and CO from Aura/MLS and Terra/MOPITT instruments, respectively, are assimilated into the three-dimensional chemical transport model MOCAGE of Météo-France using a variational 3 -D-FGAT (First Guess at Appropriate Time) method within the MOCAGE-PALM assimilation system. The usefulness <b>of</b> <b>assimilated</b> MOPITT CO data in a STE study is demonstrated in this novel result. The study shows that the use of the model MOCAGE gives consistent 3 -D fields capable of describing the synoptic evolution of the event. However, modelled O 3 and CO vertical distributions do not provide a quantitative evaluation of the intrusion. Although the assimilation of MLS data improves the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> O 3 above the tropopause compared to the free model run, it is not sufficient to reproduce the stratospheric intrusion event well. Conversely, assimilated MOPITT CO allows a better description of the stratospheric intrusion event. Indeed, the horizontal <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the CO <b>assimilated</b> field is consistent with meteorological analyses. Moreover, the vertical <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the CO <b>assimilated</b> field is in accordance with the potential vorticity distribution and reveals a deeper intrusion from the lower stratosphere downward to the mid-troposphere compared to the O 3 assimilated field. This study clearly demonstrates the capability of the assimilation of MOPITT CO to improve the CO distribution in the upper troposphere and lower stratosphere region. In addition, the behaviour <b>of</b> CO <b>assimilated</b> field is consistent with the synoptic evolution of the meteorological conditions.

This should give hint to a strategy <b>of</b> the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> the <b>assimilates</b> during stress. 25 spruces, 15 pines, 28 beeches and 24 oaks were chosen and five root systems excavated per tree species. Growth parameters were {{the width of the}} entire growth ring as well as of earlywood and latewood, extreme narrow rings -including missing rings - and extreme wide rings, and density fluctuations within the annual rings. All parameters were discussed with respect to climate. Pine and spruce show a similar growth pattern throughout the whole tree. There is also an obvious similarity in growth fluctuations between both conifer species. In oak and beech the growth variability of the roots and of the above-ground part of the tree differs. There is little similarity in growth pattern between these two broadleaved tree species as well as in comparison to pine and spruce. The climate-growth relationships of the branches, trunks and roots are similar for each tree species and stable during the lifetime of the trees. Precipitation has a positive but differently intense effect for all four tree species. Whereas the above-ground parts of the trees also depend on temperature, the roots respond mainly to moisture. The extremely narrow and wide rings reflect the limiting climatic influences more clearly. There are obvious conformities of signature years not only within but also between tree species. Missing rings are apparent in the roots, but also in the trunks and branches. Density fluctuations are caused by dryness and high temperature. All observations support a similar, but not uniform supply <b>of</b> <b>assimilates</b> to all parts of a tree. (orig.) Durch die jahresweise Ermittlung des Dickenwachstums von den Aesten bis in die Wurzeln wurde die Verteilung der Assimilate datiert und quantifiziert.

Saemtliche Merkmale wurden im Hinblick auf klimatische Ursachen diskutiert. Die Kiefer und die Fichte zeigen ein sehr aehnliches Zuwachsmuster und aehnliche Zuwachsschwankungen. Bei der Eiche und der Buche weicht die Streuung des Zuwachses der Wurzel und des oberirdischen Baumes voneinander ab. Die Aehnlichkeit des Zuwachsmusters dieser beiden Laubbaumarten untereinander sowie zu Kiefer und Fichte ist gering. Die Klima-Wachstums-Beziehungen von Ast, Stamm und Wurzel sind baumartenweise aehnlich und ueber die Lebenszeit der Baeume stabil.

Analysis of SDS-PAGE and labeling with an irreversible specific inhibitor, [H 3] 2 -DIDS (4, 4 '-diisothiocyano- 2, 2 '-stilbenedisulfonate, DIDS) demonstrated that wheat TPT was a chloroplast membrane protein with a 35 kD molecular weight, which comprised about 15 % of the total membrane proteins of chloroplasts. Western blotting analysis showed that wheat TPT is uniquely distributed in the envelope membrane of chloroplasts, but not detected in the membranes of vacuoles and mitochondria.

40|$|The <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> {{nutrients}} and <b>assimilates</b> in different organs and tissues is {{in a constant}} state of flux throughout the growth and development of a plant. At key stages during the life cycle profound changes occur, and perhaps one of the most critical of these is during seed filling. By restricting the competition for reserves in Arabidopsis plants, the ability to manipulate seed size, seed weight, or seed content has been explored. Removal of secondary inflorescences and lateral branches resulted in a stimulation of elongation of the primary inflorescence and an increase in the distance between siliques. The pruning treatment also led to the development of longer and larger siliques that contained fewer, bigger seeds. This seems to be a consequence of a reduction in the number of ovules that develop and an increase in the fatty acid content of the seeds that mature.

Two treatments were applied: (1) Reference cultivation: clear glass and lighting by 50 % HPS lamps and 50 % LED intermittent lighting (210 µmol/m 2 /s), (2) energy efficient cultivation: diffuse greenhouse cover and lighting by 50 % LED top lighting and 50 % intermittent LED lighting (210 µmol/m 2 /s). In the energy efficient cultivation, 37 % less electricity was used in the period October - May. However, energy use for heating in this treatment was higher to compensate for the lack of radiative heat. The light sum the plants received (sunlight + artificial lighting) was 6 % lower in the energy efficient cultivation compared to the reference cultivation due to the lower number of lighting hours. However, the production difference was only 0. 3 kg/m 2, less than 1 %! Detailed plant measurements showed hardly any differences between the treatments in light interception, light absorption by the leaves, photosynthesis and the production and <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilates.</b> The analysis of the crop growth model showed that the effect of the lower number of lighting hours in the energy efficient cultivation was fully compensated by the positive effects of the diffuse greenhouse cover which has a higher light transmission...|$|E
40|$|A {{study of}} flower abscission in {{commercial}} varieties of faba beans grown {{under field conditions}} showed that least flower drop occurred to flowers situated on proximal flower positions and most on distal positions within every raceme. Application of stresses to plants increased flower drop, most of which occurred to flowers situated on middle and upper flower positions. Many fertilised flowers abscised and manual tripping of all flowers did not ensure {{a high level of}} pod set. Decreasing within plant competition and the application of growth regulators all reduced flower drop. An ultrastructural study showed that either abscission or pod set occurred after a series of clearly defined cellular and enzymatic changes at the pedicel/peduncle junction. Flower removal experiments demonstrated that all flowers were capable of setting a pod and that much flower drop was initiated by the presence of small proximally situated pods. Observations on plants with different floral and plant morphologies revealed two inbred lines which displayed minimal flower drop. Experiments showed that there had been no change in the gross morphology of the stem vasculature. In commercial varieties the first formed flower was, in many cases, independent of other flowers, while the second and third flowers were connected to other flowers via the vascular strands. The inbred lines possessed an independent vascular supply to all flowers within every raceme. This arrangement circumvented any communication between proximal and distal flowers, allowed for an even <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilates,</b> so a high level of pod set was achieved. Initial experiments showed that independent vascular supply lines were more tolerant to stress. The results obtained are discussed in the thesis...|$|E

Source-sink relations were studied without mitigating differences in mineral content or physiological age that can occur in separate plant comparisons, because phosphorus was evenly distributed between leaves {{on opposite sides of}} the seedlings. Above-ground portions of each plant were exposed to 14 CO 2 for 8. 5 minutes and ambient air for 2 hours, followed by extraction and identification <b>of</b> labeled <b>assimilates.</b> Mycorrhizal halves <b>of</b> root systems accumulated 66 and 68 % of the 14 C-labeled photosynthates translocated to roots of sour orange and `Carrizo' citrange, respectively, as well as an average of 77 % greater disintegrations per minute per gram fresh weight. <b>Distribution</b> <b>of</b> 14 C-labeled <b>assimilates</b> was independent <b>of</b> phosphorus effects on photosynthate partitioning in leaves and did not reflect fresh or dry weights of roots or degree of mycorrhizal dependency of the species.

30|$|Rice (Oryza sativa L.) {{is one of}} {{the most}} {{important}} cereal crops and a staple food for more than one-half of the world’s population. In retrospect of rice breeding history, good harmony of source, sink and translocation capacity (i.e. flow) <b>of</b> <b>assimilates</b> plays an important role in improvement of rice yield potential (Donald 1968; Lafitte and Travis 1984; Ashraf et al. 1994).

40|$|Considerable {{interest}} has been evoked by {{the analysis of}} the regulatory pathway in carbohydrate metabolism and cell growth involving trehalose (TRE). TRE is at small concentrations in mesophytes such as Triticum aestivum. Studies of TRE metabolism, and genetic modification of it, have shown a very wide and important role of the pathway in regulation of many processes in development, growth and photosynthesis. It has now been established that trehalose 6 -phosphate (T 6 P), is formed from glucose- 6 -phosphate and UDP-glucose, derived from sucrose, by the action of trehalose phosphate synthase (TPS) and broken down by trehalose- 6 -phosphate phosphatase (TPP) providing for subtle regulation. The concentration of T 6 P increases with sucrose concentration. Many of the effects of T 6 P on metabolism and growth occur via the interaction of T 6 P with the SnRK 1 protein kinase system. A large concentration of sucrose increases T 6 P and thereby inhibits SnRK 1, so stimulating growth of cells and their metabolism. The T 6 P/SnRK 1 mechanism offers an important new view of how the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilates</b> to organs, such as developing cereal grains, is achieved. Changing T 6 P concentrations by genetically modifying TPS and TPP has altered photosynthesis, sugar metabolism, growth and development which affect responses to, and recovery from, environmental factors. This review briefly summarizes the factors determining, and limiting, yield of wheat, particularly mass/grain which is highly conserved. The interactions between the source and sink relations are addressed together with how T 6 P/SnRK 1 might function to determine grain number, size, and yield. The possibility of how these might be increased by modifying trehalose metabolism is considered. Cereal yields globally are not increasing and careful targeting of T 6 P may offer a way of optimizing grain growth and thus increasing yield in wheat...|$|E
40|$|In higher plants, two {{vascular}} tissues, phloem and xylem, {{are responsible}} for the transport of water, minerals and nutrients between organs. The xylem transports water and minerals absorbed by the roots and the phloem transports from source to sink organs photoassimilates synthesized in the photosynthetic leaves. The phloem is essential for higher plants in many developmental and physiological processes. It not only provides the route for the <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilates</b> but also redistribute mineral nutrients. Additionally, the phloem is essential for sending information between distant plant organs and steering developmental and defence processes. For example, flowering and tuberization time are controlled by phloem-mobile signals and important defence reactions on the whole plant level, like systemic acquired resistance or systemic gene silencing, are spread through the phloem. In addition, recent results demonstrate that also the allocation of mineral nutrients is coordinated by phloem mobile signaling molecules. However, in many studies the important analysis of phloem sap is neglected, probably because the content of sieve tubes is not easy to access. We used the EDTA-facilitated exudation method to collect the phloem sap from three plant species, Maize, Tomato and Arabidopsis. The metabolites present in the samples were analysed by GC-MS or GC-TOF to determine the range of metabolites present in the phloem sap. We detected more than 50 metabolites, including sugars, amino acids and organic acids. Because of an intrinsic biological variability in the efficiency of exudation depending on the plant samples, we developed a method for the normalisation and the statistical analysis of the phloem sap metabolite profiles. This study showed that for each species, there is a significant conservation of the phloem sap content, revealing the strong physical and physiological constraints on phloem transport. However we observed important differences in the phloem sap metabolic profiles between plant species, showing different strategies for the allocation of sugars and amino acids between organs...|$|E
40|$|A {{model of}} {{potential}} olive oil production is presented, {{based on a}} three-dimensional model of canopy photosynthesis and respiration and dynamic <b>distribution</b> <b>of</b> <b>assimilates</b> among organs. The model is used to analyse the effects of planting density (high and super-high density orchards with 408 and 1667 trees ha− 1, respectively) and climate change (ΔT of 4 °C and CO 2 concentration of 740 ppm) on olive oil production. To evaluate its predictive power, the simulations were tested with published measurements of leaf area, growth and yield for a high density olive orchard cv. ‘Arbequina’ in Cordoba, Spain. The model slightly overestimated (less than 7 %) the different measurements reported in the experiment. For all simulations, the maximum yields obtained were in agreement with literature. Simulations showed that climate change had a very small effect on yields due to compensation of the negative and positive effects of temperature and CO 2 on photosynthesis and respiration. However, high temperatures led to some sterile years {{due to lack of}} vernalization. The model predicts that super-high density olive orchards achieve higher potential yields than high-density systems and that maximum yields are reached on the third year of the orchard. The advantage of a higher density is a higher interception of solar radiation, especially during {{the first years of the}} orchard. In all the simulations, the model predicted a small decrease of the radiation use efficiency for oil production with the age of the orchard as well as an important inter-annual variability (range of 0. 11 – 0. 19 g (MJ PAR) − 1), indicating that the use of a constant radiation use efficiency may not be adequate to predict oil production.

40|$|Ecological risk {{assessments}} need to advance beyond evaluating risks to individuals that are {{largely based on}} toxicity studies conducted on a few species under laboratory conditions, to assessing population-level risks to the environment, including considerations of variability and uncertainty. Two individual-based models (IBMs), recently developed to assess current risks to sea otters and seaducks in PrinceWilliam Soundmore than 2 decades after the Exxon Valdez oil spill (EVOS), are used to explore population-level risks. In each case, the models had previously shown that there were essentially no remaining risks to individuals from polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) derived from the EVOS. New sensitivity analyses are reported here in which hypothetical environmental exposures to PAHs were heuristically increased until assimilated doses reached toxicity reference values (TRVs) derived at the no-observed-adverse-effects and lowest-observed-adverse-effects levels (NOAEL and LOAEL, respectively). For the sea otters, this was accomplished by artificially {{increasing the number of}} sea otter pits that would intersect remaining patches of subsurface oil residues by orders of magnitude over actual estimated rates. Similarly, in the seaduck assessment, the PAH concentrations in the constituents of diet, sediments, and seawater were increased in proportion to their relative contributions to the assimilated doses by orders ofmagnitude overmeasured environmental concentrations, to reach the NOAEL and LOAEL thresholds. The stochastic IBMs simulated millions of individuals. From these outputs, frequency <b>distributions</b> were derived <b>of</b> <b>assimilated</b> doses for populations of 500 000 sea otters or seaducks in each of 7 or 8 classes...|$|R
