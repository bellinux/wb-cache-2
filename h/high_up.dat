5|$|Adams {{was known}} to the Native Americans as Pahto (with various spellings) and Klickitat. In various tribal {{languages}} (Plateau Penutian, Chinookan, Salishan), Pahto means <b>high</b> <b>up,</b> very high, standing up, or high sloping mountain. The Klickitat name is of Klickitat origin and comes from the Chinookan for beyond.|$|E
5|$|Comet Hale–Bopp was {{observed}} intensively by astronomers during its perihelion passage, and several important advances in cometary science resulted from these observations. The dust production {{rate of the}} comet was very <b>high</b> (<b>up</b> to 2.0 kg/s), which may have made the inner coma optically thick. Based on {{the properties of the}} dust grains—high temperature, high albedo and strong 10μm silicate emission feature—the astronomers concluded the dust grains are smaller than observed in any other comet.|$|E
5|$|Continuing {{improvements}} in engineering and economics are enabling {{more of the}} renewable resources to be utilised. Fears regarding peak oil and climate change have driven the subject <b>high</b> <b>up</b> the political agenda and are also encouraging the use of various biofuels. Although the finances of many projects remain either speculative or dependent on market incentives, {{it is probable that}} there has been a significant, and in all likelihood long-term change, in the underpinning economics.|$|E

5|$|Diplodocids like Apatosaurus {{are often}} portrayed with their necks held <b>high</b> <b>up</b> in the air, {{allowing}} them to browse on tall trees. Some studies state diplodocid necks were less flexible than previously believed, because {{the structure of the}} neck vertebrae would not have allowed the neck to bend far upwards, and that sauropods like Apatosaurus were adapted to low browsing or ground feeding.|$|E
5|$|On Tuesday, April 29, Black went to Lee's {{residence}} at 11a.m. looking for evidence, {{and found a}} blood-smeared shirt {{at the bottom of}} a burn barrel.

The detectives, suspicious of Frank due to his nervous behavior throughout his interviews, believed that Frank had arranged the plant.|$|E
5|$|The beaches {{themselves}} were overlooked by pillboxes of various types.

5|$|Around AD1100, natives {{established}} adze quarries <b>high</b> <b>up</b> on Mauna Kea {{to extract}} the uniquely dense basalt (generated by the quick cooling of lava flows meeting glacial ice during subglacial eruptions) to make tools. Volcanic glass and gabbro were collected for blades and fishing gear, and māmane wood was preferred for the handles. At peak quarry activity after AD1400, there were separate facilities for rough and fine cutting; shelters with food, water, and wood to sustain the workers; and workshops creating the finished product.|$|E

Thanks to his enthusiasm, the town became a favourite destination for Scandinavian painters. In addition to Marie, the lunch scene includes Zahrtmann and Krøyer himself.|$|E
5|$|In Philadelphia itself, the {{combination}} of snow and sleet closed many of the schools, delayed flights, trains and buses. The school district parochial schools were closed on the 14th, as were the regional and central administrative offices. During the midday hours on the 14th, giant slabs of ice slid off tops of buildings in Center City and crashed to the ground. Chunks of ice as large as three feet wide {{made their way to}} the pavement from <b>high</b> <b>up.</b> Police started to block off areas where the ice was falling, however one man was hit in the head by the falling ice and was knocked to the ground.|$|E
5|$|Napoleon {{is shown}} to be {{as he would have}} been <b>high</b> <b>up</b> in the mountains, as a mortal and imperilled man. While this seems in some way demeaning to Napoleon's figure (and {{contrasts}} in the extreme with David's version, which shows Napoleon impervious to the cold, and in a heroic light), Delaroche's artwork was not intended to portray him in a hostile or unbecoming way. Delaroche wanted to depict Napoleon as a credible man, who suffered and underwent human hardship too, on his most daring exploits, and felt that making him appear as he really {{would have been in the}} situation would by no means debase or diminish Napoleon's iconic status or legacy, but rather make him a more admirable person.|$|E

5|$|Procellariids are {{vulnerable}} to other threats as well. Ingestion of plastic flotsam {{is a problem for}} the family as it is for many other seabirds. Once swallowed, this plastic can cause a general decline in the fitness of the bird, or in some cases lodge in the gut and cause a blockage, leading to death by starvation. Procellariids are also vulnerable to general marine pollution, as well as oil spills. Some species, such as the Barau's petrel, the Newell's shearwater or the Cory's shearwater, which nest <b>high</b> <b>up</b> on large developed islands are victims of light pollution. Chicks that are fledging are attracted to streetlights and are unable to reach the sea. An estimated 20–40% of fledging Barau's petrels are attracted to the streetlights on Réunion.|$|E
5|$|The {{discovery}} in 1987 of a primitive tomb at Mondeval de Sora <b>high</b> <b>up</b> {{in the mountains}} to the south of Cortina testifies to the presence of Mesolithic man in the area {{as far back as the}} 6th millennium B.C. In the 6th century B.C., Etruscan writing was introduced in the province of Cadore, in whose possession is remained until the early 15th century. From the 3rd century B.C., the Romans assimilated the Veneti people, giving the area the name of Amplitium (from amplus meaning wide), today's Ampezzo.|$|E
5|$|When {{the first}} traffic flowed, crews had not {{finished}} some final tasks, such as painting stripes. Motorists saw a relocation with several mountain cuts built <b>high</b> <b>up</b> the canyon wall, {{with a view}} of the slide and former lake. The roadbed was not expected to last, as weather conditions had been unfavorable when the asphalt was laid. Two mountain cuts were unstable, requiring several months of work before they could be left unattended. During this time, the state stationed two full-time watches at the cuts, who would close the road while falling rocks were cleared. The cut through Billies Mountain was described by the construction crews as a new, man-made mountain pass.|$|E

5|$|After {{the lookout}} {{at the summit}} was abandoned, the Forest Service changed {{strategies}} from a few lookouts very <b>high</b> <b>up</b> to many lookouts on lower peaks. They placed many lookouts around Adams including one on the southwest slopes of Adams at Madcat Meadows, one on Goat Butte, one on Council Bluff above Council Lake, and many other places farther from the mountain. Eventually these lookouts became obsolete as airplanes became the cheaper method to spot fires. Most all of these lookouts have since been abandoned and most all have been removed or left to disintegrate. One, Burley Mountain, is staffed every summer and another, Red Mountain, was restored in 2010 and decisions regarding its future are pending. Two lookouts remain nearby on the Yakama Indian Reservation. One, Satus Peak, is staffed every season and the other, Signal Peak, is staffed during periods of high fire danger.|$|E
5|$|Frank Arthur Worsley {{was born}} on 22 February 1872 in Akaroa, New Zealand, one of three {{children}} of a farmer, Henry Worsley, and his wife Georgiana. His grandfather, Henry Francis Worsley (1806–1876), had migrated from Rugby in England aboard the Cornwall to Lyttelton, where he arrived with his large family in December 1851. The family lived in Grehan Valley, <b>high</b> <b>up</b> above Akaroa. Worsley's mother died {{while he was a}} toddler. He was sent to school in Akaroa but when his father moved his family to take up work clearing bush from land at Peraki, he was homeschooled for a time. From age 10, he helped with clearing land for sheep pasture and growing cocksfoot. When Frank was 11, his older brother, Harry, left to join the New Zealand Shipping Company as an apprentice and at about the same time, his father moved his family, which was now just Frank and his 13-year-old sister, to Christchurch. Frank attended Fendalton School and marked his final year of schooling by being made head boy.|$|E
5|$|Later, diplodocids {{were often}} portrayed with their necks held <b>high</b> <b>up</b> in the air, {{allowing}} them to graze from tall trees. Studies using computer models have shown that neutral posture of the neck was horizontal, rather than vertical, and scientists such as Kent Stephens have used this to argue that sauropods including Diplodocus did not raise their heads much above shoulder level. A nuchal ligament may have held the neck in this position. A 2009 study found that all tetrapods appear to hold their necks at the maximum possible vertical extension when in a normal, alert posture, and argued that the same would hold true for sauropods barring any unknown, unique characteristics that set the soft tissue anatomy of their necks apart from other animals. One of the sauropod models {{in this study was}} Diplodocus, which they found would have held its neck at about a 45° angle with the head pointed downwards in a resting posture.|$|E
