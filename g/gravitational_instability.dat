40|$|Star {{complexes}} are {{the largest}} globular regions of star formation in galaxies. If there is a spiral density wave, nuclear ring, tidal arm, or other welldefined stellar structure, then <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities</b> in the gaseous component produce giant cloud complexes with a spacing of about three times the width.

Without stellar density waves or similar structures, random <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities</b> form flocculent spirals and these fragment into star complexes, OB associations and star clusters in the same way.

50|$|A {{problem with}} this model is {{determining}} what kept the disk stable prior to the instability.

40|$|Abstract. Star {{formation}} by <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities,</b> sequential triggering, and turbulence triggering are briefly {{reviewed in}} order to compare the various mechanisms that are observed in main galaxy disks {{with those in the}} inner kiloparsec regions. Although very little is known about inner galaxy triggering mechanisms, there appear to be examples that parallel the well-known mechanisms around us. The balance may shift slightly, however, because of the high densities in nuclear regions. The sequential triggering mode, in which one generation of stars triggers another, should be less prominent compared to <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities</b> and turbulence triggering when the ambient density is so high that the local dynamical time scale is less than the lifetime of an O-type star.

40|$|In {{this paper}} we discuss the {{influence}} of <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities</b> in massive protostellar discs on the dynamics of dust grains. Starting from a Smoothed Particle Hydrodynamics (SPH) simulation, we have computed {{the evolution of the}} dust in a quasi-static gas density structure typical of self-gravitating disc. For different grain size distributions we have investigated the capability of spiral arms to trap particles. We have run 3 D radiative transfer simulations in order to construct maps of the expected emission at (sub-) millimetre and near-infrared wavelengths. Finally, we have simulated realistic observations of our disc models at (sub-) millimetre and near-infrared wavelengths as they may appear with the Atacama Large Millimetre/sub-millimetre Array (ALMA) and the High-Contrast Coronographic Imager for Adaptive Optics (HiCIAO) in order to investigate whether there are observational signatures of the spiral structure. We find that the pressure inhomogeites induced by <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities</b> produce a non-negligible dynamical effect on centimetre sized particles leading to significant overdensities in spiral arms. We also find that the spiral structure is readily detectable by ALMA over a wide range of (sub-) millimetre wavelengths and by HiCIAO in near-infrared scattered light for non-face-on discs located in the Ophiucus star-forming region. In addition, we find clear spatial spectral index variations across the disc, revealing that the dust trapping produces a migration of large grains that can be potentially investigated through multi-wavelenghts observations in the (sub-) millimetric. Therefore, the spiral arms observed to date in protoplanetary disc might be interpreted as density waves induced by the development of <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities.</b> Comment: 14 pages, 12 figures.

40|$|To date, most {{simulations}} of the chemistry in protoplanetary discs have used 1 + 1 D or 2 D axisymmetric α-disc models to determine chemical compositions within young systems. This assumption is inappropriate for non-axisymmetric, gravitationally unstable discs, {{which may be}} a significant stage in early protoplanetary disc evolution. Using 3 D radiative hydrodynamics, we have modelled the physical and chemical evolution of a 0. 17 [*]M⊙ self-gravitating disc {{over a period of}} 2000 yr. The 0. 8 [*]M⊙ central protostar is likely to evolve into a solar-like star, and hence this Class 0 or early Class I young stellar object may be analogous to our early Solar system. Shocks driven by <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities</b> enhance the desorption rates, which dominate the changes in gas-phase fractional abundances for most species. We find {{that at the end of}} the simulation, a number of species distinctly trace the spiral structure of our relatively low-mass disc, particularly CN. We compare our simulation to that of a more massive disc, and conclude that mass differences between gravitationally unstable discs may not have a strong impact on the chemical composition. We find that over the duration of our simulation, successive shock heating has a permanent effect on the abundances of HNO, CN and NH 3, which may have significant implications for both simulations and observations. We also find that HCO+ may be a useful tracer of disc mass. We conclude that <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities</b> induced in lower mass discs can significantly, and permanently, affect the chemical evolution, and that observations with high-resolution instruments such as Atacama Large Millimeter/submillimeter Array (ALMA) offer a promising means of characterizing <b>gravitational</b> <b>instabilities</b> in protosolar discs...|$|R
