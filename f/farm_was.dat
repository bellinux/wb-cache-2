5|$|Hallett Wind <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> {{developed}} in four stages: Hallett 1 (also known as Brown Hill Wind Farm), Hallett 2 (Hallett Hill), Hallett 4 (North Brown Hill) and Hallett 5 (Bluff Range). The proposed Hallett 3 (Mt Bryan) wind <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> {{put on hold}} by AGL in 2012.|$|E
5|$|Of these, Church Farm and Forster's Farm {{remain in}} operation. Upper Church <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> {{originally}} known as Harry's Farm, after a William Harry {{who died in}} 1544.|$|E
5|$|Another {{spin-off}} starring Rainn Wilson as Dwight Schrute {{running a}} bed-and-breakfast and beet farm, titled The <b>Farm,</b> <b>was</b> proposed in early 2012. In October 2012, however, NBC {{decided not to}} go forward with the series. The backdoor pilot episode instead aired as part of the ninth and final season of The Office on March 14, 2013.|$|E
50|$|In 1987 about 2.7 million private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> in operation. About 57 {{percent of}} these were smaller than five hectares. Of the {{remaining}} <b>farms,</b> 25 percent <b>were</b> between five and ten hectares and 11 percent were between ten and fifteen hectares. Only 7 percent of private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> larger than fifteen hectares. Whereas {{the majority of the}} private <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> below optimum size, the majority of state <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> excessively large. Only 12 percent of the latter <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> below 200 hectares, and 60 percent were larger than 1,000 hectares.|$|R
30|$|From Table  6, {{it may be}} {{observed}} that marginal-small <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> mostly Cluster 3 farms (91.67 %), i.e. smaller farms with higher off-farm income. Medium <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> Cluster 2 (56.52 %) and Cluster 3 (30.43 %) farms i.e. diversified farms and small farms with higher off-farm income. Noticeably, large <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> distributed across all clusters, perhaps due to their higher flexibility in allocation of land resources among different crops/enterprises. Alternatively, Cluster 1 <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> mostly (75.00 %) large farms, Cluster II <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> largely Medium (56.52 %) and Large (41.67 %) farms, Cluster 3 <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> mostly Marginal-small <b>farms</b> (82.86 %) and Cluster 4 <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> Large <b>farms</b> (71.43 %). The distribution of clusters across the farm size differed significantly (Likelihood ratio sig. value[*]=[*]. 00) indicating heterogeneous nature of farm types across farm sizes.|$|R
50|$|Church <b>Farm</b> <b>is</b> next to {{the parish}} church and Applesham <b>Farm</b> <b>is</b> about 0.6 mi to the south.|$|R
5|$|Brook <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> {{named for}} the brook that ran near the {{roadside}} and that eventually went to the Charles River. It was surrounded by low hills and its meadows and sunny slopes were diversified by orchard, quiet groves and denser pine woods. The land, however, {{turned out to be}} difficult to farm.|$|E
5|$|Cathedral Rocks Wind Farm is in {{a remote}} coastal area located near the {{southern}} tip of the Eyre Peninsula in South Australia, about 30km south west of Port Lincoln. It has 33 wind turbines capable of generating 66 MW in total. Construction started in 2004, and the first turbines were commissions in late 2005. The wind <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> fully operational by 2007.|$|E
5|$|Evidence of Bronze Age {{settlements}} {{has been}} found within the woods during archaeological excavations. Timber from the woods {{has been used in}} the building of several nationally significant buildings, as well as locally; the Great Barn at Manor <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> built from oak from the woods.|$|E
50|$|Traditional organic <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> {{labor and}} knowledge-intensive whereas {{conventional}} <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> capital-intensive, requiring more energy and manufactured inputs.|$|R
2500|$|... "Family farm" [...] and [...] "corporate farm" [...] {{are often}} defined as {{mutually}} exclusive terms, {{with the two}} having different interests. This mostly stems from the widespread assumption that family <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> small <b>farms</b> while corporate <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> large-scale operations. While {{it is true that}} the majority of small <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> family owned, many large <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> also family businesses, including some of the largest farms in the US.|$|R
5000|$|... #Caption: Royalla Solar <b>Farm</b> <b>is</b> located {{south of}} the city. The <b>farm</b> <b>is</b> capable of {{generating}} electricity for 4,500 homes.|$|R
5|$|In Eastern inland Norway and Trøndelag, {{the houses}} around a tun were {{typically}} organized {{in a square}} (firkanttun); in Gudbrandsdal, there was a distinction between inntun (inner tun) and uttun (outer tun). The configuration of houses also depended on whether the <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> situated on a hill or in flatter terrain.|$|E
5|$|It was {{not until}} 1 February that the deaths were {{reported}} to Defra. The <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> sealed off while tests were carried out, on samples taken from the dead birds, at the Veterinary Laboratories Agency in Weybridge, Surrey. Another 1,500 birds died on 2 February. Then on 3 February 2007 the H5N1 causation was confirmed.|$|E
5|$|Jones died on November 16, 1836 near Paris, Ontario. He {{was buried}} at Cold Springs, where his <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> located. After {{the death of}} his son Peter in 1856, Jones' remains were moved to Greenwood Cemetery in Brantford, Ontario and interred beside Peter's. His grave was unmarked.|$|E
5000|$|Philippine Ostrich & Crocodile <b>Farm</b> <b>is</b> {{the first}} {{combined}} ostrich and crocodile {{farm in the}} Philippines.

50|$|Today the Game <b>Farm</b> <b>is</b> home to over 200 animals. For many people, {{visiting the}} game <b>farm</b> <b>is</b> a yearly tradition. The Long Island Game <b>Farm</b> <b>is</b> {{one of the}} oldest and most {{well-known}} establishments in Manorville, and has been one of the town's major landmarks since its opening.|$|R
50|$|Wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> often {{built on}} land {{that has already}} been {{impacted}} by land clearing. The vegetation clearing and ground disturbance required for wind <b>farms</b> <b>is</b> minimal compared with coal mines and coal-fired power stations. If wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> decommissioned, the landscape can be returned to its previous condition.|$|R
5|$|Linwood <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> {{used for}} {{sporting}} events. In July 1876, the Christchurch rugby team met their South Canterbury counterparts from Timaru (Christchurch won the game), and in May 1877, the Canterbury Hunt Club met for a steeplechase {{in the sand}} hills of the farm.|$|E
5|$|Offshore {{wind power}} is {{captured}} by wind turbines placed out at sea; {{it has the}} advantage that wind speeds are higher than on land, though wind farms are more costly to construct offshore. The first offshore wind <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> installed in Denmark in 1991, and the installed capacity of European offshore wind farms reached 3 GW in 2010.|$|E
5|$|Starfish Hill Wind Farm is near Cape Jervis on the Fleurieu Peninsula. It {{comprises}} 23 turbines of 1.5 MW each, with 8 turbines on Starfish Hill and 15 on {{the nearby}} Salt Creek Hill, giving a combined generating capacity of 34.5 MW. Starfish Hill Wind <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> commissioned in September 2003, making it the first major wind farm in South Australia.|$|E

5|$|The Spafford Farm massacre, also {{referred}} to as the Wayne massacre, was an attack upon U.S. militia and civilians that occurred as part of the Black Hawk War near present-day South Wayne, Wisconsin. Spafford <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> settled in 1830 by Omri Spafford and his partner Francis Spencer.|$|E
5|$|The {{area was}} {{uninhabited}} by Europeans until after World War II, when a severe drought caused white Afrikaans speaking farmers (Boers) to move in. The <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> later procured by the apartheid government {{as part of}} the Odendaal Plan and became part of the Damaraland bantustan. The white settlers left in 1965.|$|E
5|$|Wivelrod is a hamlet in {{the extreme}} {{south-east}} corner of the parish of Bentworth. Wivelrod was first mentioned in documents dating to 1259. In the 18th century Wivelrod Manor belonged to the owner of Bentworth Hall, although some land, excluding the <b>farm,</b> <b>was</b> sold in the 1830s for £900, when the estate was bought by Roger Staples Horman Fisher.|$|E
50|$|Mussel <b>farming</b> <b>is</b> {{a fast-growing}} {{industry}} in New Zealand. In 2000, 3000 hectares of mussel <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> in production, with proposals for another 30,000 ha. Typically, individual <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> less than 50 ha {{and placed in}} sheltered waters close to the shore. With more recent technological developments larger mussel <b>farms</b> can now <b>be</b> constructed further offshore and in more exposed waters.|$|R

50|$|<b>Farming</b> <b>was</b> {{always a}} major {{activity}} in Nechako. As {{the number of}} <b>farms</b> <b>was</b> increasing, the acreage of the farms became smaller. The <b>farms</b> <b>were</b> used for pure-bred production, green house, produce commercial beef, and gray/hay production. A total of 18925 acre were filled with field crops such as hay, wheat, and barley.|$|R
5|$|British {{journalist}} David Rose {{writes that}} by 1976 the <b>Farm</b> <b>was</b> already {{seen as a}} sink estate, and by 1980 a Department of the Environment report had suggested demolition, although a regeneration project after the 1985 riots led to improvements. Sir Kenneth Newman, Metropolitan Police commissioner from 1982 to 1987, regarded the estate as one of London's symbolic locations, or potential no-go areas, along with Railton Road in Brixton, All Saints Road in Notting Hill, the Notting Hill Carnival, and the Stonebridge Estate in Harlesden. The 1986 Gifford Inquiry into the rioting criticised the police for having adopted this attitude.|$|E
5|$|Brown {{bought his}} first Arabian horses in 1910 and founded the Maynesboro Stud near Berlin in 1912. The <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> {{named after the}} {{original}} settlement in the area, Maynesborough, located in the White Mountains in an area {{also known as the}} Great North Woods Region. The main stallion barn, although moved from its original location, has been preserved and restored by the Berlin and Coös County Historical Society, which is also restoring the work horse barns of the Brown Company. On September 15, 2012, the society celebrated the 100th anniversary of the founding of the Maynesboro Stud.|$|E
5|$|By 1952, {{the farm}} {{had become a}} burden to Olga and her husband. They were both elderly; their sons had moved away; labor was hard to come by; the Colonel {{suffered}} increasing ill-health, and some of Olga's remaining jewelry was stolen. The <b>farm</b> <b>was</b> sold, and Olga, {{her husband and her}} former maid, Mimka, moved to a smaller five-room house at 2130 Camilla Road, Cooksville, Ontario, a suburb of Toronto now amalgamated into the city of Mississauga. Mimka suffered a stroke that left her an invalid, and Olga nursed her until Mimka's death on 24 January 1954.|$|E
5000|$|Large {{onshore wind}} <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> usually {{directly}} connected to the National Grid, but smaller wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> connected to a regional distribution network, termed [...] "embedded generation". In 2009 nearly half of wind generation capacity was embedded generation, but this is expected to reduce in future years as larger wind <b>farms</b> <b>are</b> built.|$|R
25|$|A {{commercial}} oyster <b>farm</b> <b>is</b> {{situated on}} the sandbanks {{on the north side}} of the lower Fleet. The species <b>farmed</b> <b>is</b> the Pacific oyster, rather than the local oyster, and the <b>farm</b> racks <b>are</b> always visible at low tide.|$|R
