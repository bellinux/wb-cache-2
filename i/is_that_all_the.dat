25|$|In 1805, {{several new}} species were {{reported}} with red, purple, lilac, and pale yellow coloring, {{and the first}} true double flower was produced in Belgium.

Kokh tombs in the Nazareth area have been excavated by B. Bagatti, N. Feig, Z. Yavor, and noted by Z. Gal.|$|E
25|$|Genetics and the Origin of Species has {{two main}} points to make. The {{first is that}} {{speciation}} is a genuine problem that must {{be explained by the}} theory of evolution. In nature, {{there is not a single}} population of organisms separated from each other by small variations. Instead, the natural world is divided into species, each with its own limited range of variability. The second point <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> variations can be explained by the principles of genetics.|$|E
25|$|At {{its peak}} around 500 BC {{the size of}} the city would have been some 20,000–35,000 citizens, plus {{numerous}} helots and perioikoi. The likely total of 40,000–50,000 made Sparta one of the largest Greek cities; however, according to Thucydides, the population of Athens in 431 BC was 360,000–610,000, making it unlikely that Athens was smaller than Sparta in 5th century BC. The French classicist François Ollier in his 1933 book Le mirage spartiate ("The Spartan Mirage") warned that a major scholarly problem regarding Sparta <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> surviving accounts were written by non-Spartans who often presented an excessively idealized image of Sparta. Ollier's views have been widely accepted by scholars.|$|E

Subsequently, the game did not feature any Sierra characters for co-players.|$|R
25|$|There {{are both}} {{advantages}} and disadvantages to using bath treatments. Bath treatments are more difficult and need more manpower to administer, requiring skirts or tarpaulins to be placed around the cages to contain the drug. Prevention of reinfection is a challenge since it is practically impossible to treat an entire bay {{in a short time}} period. Since the volume of water is imprecise, the required concentration is not guaranteed. Crowding of fish to reduce the volume of drug can also stress the fish. Recent use of well-boats containing the drugs has reduced both the concentration and environmental concerns, although transferring fish to the well boat and back to the cage can be stressful. The major advantage to bath treatments <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> fish will be treated equally, in contrast to in-feed treatments where amount of drug ingested can vary due to a number of reasons.|$|E
25|$|One of {{the common}} misconceptions about United States history prior to the Civil War <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> {{citizens}} of the northern states were against slavery. In fact, many Northerners were all for slavery, especially in states closer to the Confederacy like Pennsylvania, Ohio and Delaware. There {{were more than a}} few abolitionists in Pennsylvania: Enos Hawley, a Quaker citizen of Muncy, {{was one of the most}} prominent abolitionists in Lycoming County. Hawley, a tanner by trade, was like most Quakers a strong supporter of the abolition of slavery. Hawley invited the now-unknown speaker to come to Muncy to speak against slavery. This speaker arrived in April 1842. His arrival and coinciding speech set off a tremendous riot that led to the near destruction of a local schoolhouse and the controversial pardoning of the rioters by Pennsylvania Governor David R. Porter.|$|E
25|$|Customs for {{reciting the}} Mourner's Kaddish vary {{markedly}} among various communities. In Sephardi synagogues, the custom <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> mourners stand and chant the Kaddish together. In Ashkenazi synagogues, the earlier custom {{was that one}} mourner be chosen to lead the prayer {{on behalf of the}} rest, though most congregations have now adopted the Sephardi custom. In many Reform synagogues, the entire congregation recites the Mourner's Kaddish together. This is sometimes said to be for those victims of the Holocaust who have no one left to recite the Mourner's Kaddish on their behalf. In some congregations (especially Reform and Conservative ones), the Rabbi will read a list of the deceased who have a Yahrzeit on that day (or who have died within the past month), and then ask the congregants to name any people they are mourning for. Some synagogues try to multiply the number of times that the Mourner's Kaddish is recited, for example, reciting a separate Mourner's Kaddish after both Aleinu and then each closing Psalm. Other synagogues limit themselves to one Mourner's Kaddish {{at the end of the}} service.|$|E

25|$|Social {{networks}} {{are beginning to}} be adopted by healthcare professionals {{as a means to}} manage institutional knowledge, disseminate peer to peer knowledge and to highlight individual physicians and institutions. The advantage of using a dedicated medical social networking site <b>is</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> members are screened against the state licensing board list of practitioners. A new trend is emerging with social networks created to help its members with various physical and mental ailments. For people suffering from life altering diseases, PatientsLikeMe offers its members the chance to connect with others dealing with similar issues and research patient data related to their condition. For alcoholics and addicts, SoberCircle gives people in recovery the ability to communicate with one another and strengthen their recovery through the encouragement of others who can relate to their situation. DailyStrength is also a website that offers support groups for a wide array of topics and conditions, including the support topics offered by PatientsLikeMe and SoberCircle. Some social networks aim to encourage healthy lifestyles in their users. SparkPeople offers community and social networking tools for peer support during weight loss. Fitocracy and QUENTIQ are focused on exercise, enabling users to share their own workouts and comment on those of other users.|$|E

500|$|Typical HMM-based methods work by {{representing}} an MSA {{as a form}} of directed acyclic graph {{known as}} a partial-order graph, which consists of a series of nodes representing possible entries in the columns of an MSA. In this representation a column that is absolutely conserved (that <b>is,</b> <b>that</b> <b>all</b> <b>the</b> sequences in the MSA share a particular character at a particular position) is coded as a single node with as many outgoing connections as there are possible characters in the next column of the alignment. In the terms of a typical hidden Markov model, the observed states are the individual alignment columns and the [...] "hidden" [...] states represent the presumed ancestral sequence from which the sequences in the query set are hypothesized to have descended. An efficient search variant of the dynamic programming method, known as the Viterbi algorithm, is generally used to successively align the growing MSA to the next sequence in the query set to produce a new MSA. This is distinct from progressive alignment methods because the alignment of prior sequences is updated at each new sequence addition. However, like progressive methods, this technique can be influenced by the order in which the sequences in the query set are integrated into the alignment, especially when the sequences are distantly related.|$|E
