5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the hair follicle. In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the hair follicle. However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> cells to stick together. The accumulation of <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the hair follicle, thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the hair follicle. If the microcomedone is superficial within the hair follicle, the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the hair follicle, this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E
5|$|Acne, {{also known}} as acne vulgaris, is a {{long-term}} skin disease that occurs when hair follicles are clogged with <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> cells and oil from the skin. It is characterized by blackheads or whiteheads, pimples, oily skin, and possible scarring. It primarily affects areas of the skin with a relatively high number of oil glands, including the face, {{upper part of the}} chest, and back. The resulting appearance can lead to anxiety, reduced self-esteem and, in extreme cases, depression or thoughts of suicide.|$|E
5|$|It {{is widely}} {{suspected}} that the anaerobic bacterial species Propionibacterium acnes (P. acnes) contributes {{to the development of}} acne, but its exact role is not well understood. There are specific sub-strains of P. acnes associated with normal skin, and moderate or severe inflammatory acne. It is unclear whether these undesirable strains evolve on-site or are acquired, or possibly both depending on the person. These strains have the capability of changing, perpetuating, or adapting to the abnormal cycle of inflammation, oil production, and inadequate sloughing of <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> cells from acne pores. Infection with the parasitic mite Demodex is associated with the development of acne. It is unclear whether eradication of the mite improves acne.|$|E
60|$|All the {{pleasant}} morning we slid smoothly along over the plains, through thin--not thick--forests of great melancholy gum trees, with trunks rugged with curled sheets of flaking bark--erysipelas convalescents, so to speak, shedding their <b>dead</b> <b>skins.</b> And all along were tiny cabins, built sometimes of wood, sometimes of gray-blue corrugated iron; and the doorsteps and fences were clogged with children--rugged little simply-clad chaps {{that looked as}} if they had been imported from the banks of the Mississippi without breaking bulk.|$|R

2500|$|Dominic {{was educated}} in the schools of Palencia (they became a {{university}} soon afterwards) where he devoted six years to the arts and four to theology. In 1191, when Spain was desolated by famine, young Dominic gave away his money and sold his clothes, furniture and even precious manuscripts to feed the hungry. Dominic reportedly told his astonished fellow students, [...] "Would you have me study off these <b>dead</b> <b>skins,</b> when men are dying of hunger?" [...] In 1194, around age twenty-five, Dominic joined the Canons Regular in the canonry in the Cathedral of Osma, following the rule of Saint Augustine.|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{hypothesized that}} acne represented {{a disease of}} the skin's hair follicle, and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as the causal agents of comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) could completely explain the disease. This led to the current understanding that acne {{could be explained by}} a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the hair follicle pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.|$|E
5|$|Many parasites {{latch onto}} whales, notably whale lice and whale barnacles. Almost all species of whale lice are {{specialized}} towards a certain species of whale, and {{there can be}} more than one species per whale. Whale lice eat <b>dead</b> <b>skin,</b> resulting in minor wounds in the skin. Whale louse infestations are especially evident in right whales, where colonies propagate on their callosities. Though not a parasite, whale barnacles latch onto the skin of a whale during their larval stage. However, in doing so it does not harm nor benefit the whale, so their relationship is often labeled as an example of commensalism. Some baleen whales will deliberately rub themselves on substrate to dislodge parasites. Some species of barnacle, such as Conchoderma auritum and whale barnacles, attach to the baleen plates, though this seldom occurs. A species of copepod, Balaenophilus unisetus, inhabits baleen plates of whales in tropical waters. A species of Antarctic diatom, Cocconeis ceticola, forms a film on the skin, which takes a month to develop; this film causes minor damage to the skin. They are also plagued by internal parasites such as stomach worms, cestodes, nematodes, liver flukes, and acanthocephalans.|$|E
5|$|Mimicry of mutualistic {{species is}} seen in coral reef fish, where the models, certain cleaner fish, are greatly {{disadvantaged}} {{by the presence of}} the mimic. Cleaner fish are the allies of many other species, which allow them to eat their parasites and <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> in a mutually beneficial cleaning symbiosis. Some allow the cleaner to venture inside their mouths and gill cavities to hunt these parasites. However, one species of cleaner, the bluestreak cleaner wrasse (Labroides dimidiatus), is the unknowing model of a mimetic species, the sabre-toothed blenny (Aspidontus taeniatus). This wrasse, shown in the image cleaning a grouper of the genus Epinephelus, resides in coral reefs in the Indian and the Pacific Oceans, and is recognized by other fishes who then allow it to clean them. Its imposter, a species of blenny, lives in the Indian Ocean and not only looks like it in terms of size and coloration, but even mimics the cleaner's 'dance'. Having fooled its prey into letting its guard down, it then bites it, tearing off scales or a piece of fin before fleeing the scene. Fish grazed upon in this fashion soon learn to distinguish mimic from model, but because the similarity is close between the two they become much more cautious of the model as well, such that both are affected. Due to victims' ability to discriminate between foe and helper, the blennies have evolved close similarity, right down to the regional level.|$|E

50|$|Kumal {{remains in}} a cage of the circus next to the cage of an old former tiger star named Caesar. In order {{to bring back the}} skin of the tigress for the prince, McRory makes a deal with Zerbino and Saladin to kill Caesar and skin him, thus, to pass off as the <b>dead</b> <b>skinned</b> tigress itself. Kumal is then {{replaced}} as the soon-to-be new star attraction of the circus in Caesar's cage with McRory's condition that the circus people take good care of him. However, the tiger skin trick is foiled when the prince's wife discovers the hole through the wrong ear; much to the prince's disappointment.|$|R
25|$|Wetshaving {{also has}} exfoliating properties; first, {{the action of}} moving a shaving brush vigorously across the face washes the face and removes <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> at the same time. After {{applying}} the lather with a brush, {{the use of a}} double-edged safety razor or straight razor removes <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> simply {{by the fact that the}} aforementioned razors are dragged much closer across the skin and remove <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> more effectively than the cartridge or electric razor.|$|E

25|$|The {{negative}} {{aspect of}} the oily-skin type is that oily complexions are especially susceptible to clogged pores, blackheads, and buildup of <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> cells {{on the surface of}} the skin.

Yet scarcely a single accent among the many afloat to-night could have such power to impress a listener with thoughts of its origin.

25|$|In {{conventional}} scalp EEG, {{the recording}} is obtained by placing electrodes on the scalp with a conductive gel or paste, usually after preparing the scalp area by light abrasion to reduce impedance due to <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> cells.

Although necrosis is extremely rare, smokers have an increased risk to develop skin necrosis. Stopping nicotine use and smoking several weeks before and several weeks after surgery cleans the body and improves the chance of an uneventful recovery.|$|E

25|$|The {{entire life}} cycle of D. folliculorum {{takes place in the}} time span of 18–24 days on its host. During the day, they feed on <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> cells within hair follicles. At night, they emerge onto the surface to mate and lay eggs in hair follicles. A female adult lays 20–24 eggs in a single hair follicle; as they grow they become tightly packed, and develop into larvae. The larva is then washed by a sebaceous flow, {{produced}} by the host’s sebaceous glands, into the mouth of the hair follicle where it matures into an adult. It takes seven days for the larva to develop into an adult that is ready to reproduce sexually.|$|E
25|$|Navel lint (also {{known by}} {{names such as}} navel fluff, belly button lint, belly button fluff, and dip lint) is an {{accumulation}} of fluffy fibers in the navel cavity.

The reasons for its accumulation in the navel are a subject of speculation. A likely hypothesis is that rubbing of navel hairs and clothing contributes to a build-up of static electricity, resulting in the collection of clothing fibers and to a lesser extent, <b>dead</b> <b>skin</b> cells.|$|E
