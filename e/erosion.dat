5|$|Formation of {{approximately}} the current {{depth of the}} Colorado River's Grand Canyon by 1.2 mya further caused its tributaries to cut down even deeper. Headward <b>erosion</b> {{of one of those}} tributaries, the Paria River, eroded north-northwestward toward what is now Paria Amphitheater. The river took a route roughly parallel to and east of the Paunsaugunt Fault. <b>Erosion</b> from snow and rain that fall directly on the east-facing rim of the Paunsaugunt Plateau forms gullies that widen into alcoves and amphitheaters while differential <b>erosion</b> and frost wedging create the hoodoos. Streams on the plateau do not contribute to the formation of alcoves or amphitheaters because they flow away from the rim. <b>Erosion</b> continues in this fashion today.|$|E

This study assessed the incidence of peptic ulcers in {{the presence or absence}} of <b>erosions</b> or H pylori in a group of longterm NSAID users (n = 50), undergoing endoscopy at 0, 4, 12, and 24 weeks while continuing with NSAIDs. Ulcers diagnosed at baseline endoscopy were excluded. Ulcers developed in nine of 23 patients (39 %) with pre-existing <b>erosions</b> compared with six of 27 (22 %) without <b>erosions</b> (p < 0. 05). The group infected with H pylori (n = 30) had a total of 18 patients (60 %) with <b>erosions,</b> a total of 12 ulcers (40 %), and eight ulcers (27 %) complicating previous <b>erosions,</b> compared with five (25 %, p < 0. 01), three (15 %, p < 0. 05), and one (5 %, p < 0. 01) respectively in patients not infected with H pylori (n = 20). Ulcer development was not influenced by the initial number of <b>erosions</b> but strongly associated with H pylori positive duodenal <b>erosions.</b> It is concluded that ulcers are more likely to develop in longterm NSAID users who have mucosal <b>erosions</b> or H pylori, or both...|$|R
40|$|Both <b>erosions</b> {{and joint}} space {{narrowing}} (JSN) are aspects of structural damage in rheumatoid arthritis. Most {{information is available}} on structural damage as one concept. However, the differential aspect of the effects on bone and cartilage could yield interesting information. Comparative information of these aspects can be based only on radiographic data on <b>erosions</b> and JSN. Both <b>erosions</b> and JSN are the consequence of infl ammation, and their progression is inhibited by drugs that inhibit infl ammation. These two processes often occur in parallel but joints in which <b>erosions</b> are present show a preference for progression of <b>erosions</b> and, to a lesser extent, development of JSN. The reverse is true for joints with JSN present, {{where there is a}} preference for worsening of JSN over development of <b>erosions.</b> Repair is possible for <b>erosions</b> as well as JSN and this is related to the absence of infl ammation and effective treatment (especially methotrexate in combination with a tumour necrosis factor blocker) ...|$|R

40|$|SummaryObjectiveTo {{evaluate}} {{the association between}} ultrasound (US) detected inflammation at baseline and the subsequent development of new bone <b>erosions</b> at follow-up in patients with hand osteoarthritis (HOA). Method 32 of the 35 (10 controls, 12 patients with non erosive HOA (non-EHOA), 13 with EHOA subjects originally studied were re-evaluated 3. 9 years after the initial study, by means of standard radiography and US examination. Kellgren–Lawrence (K-L) and Kallman scores were utilized to evaluate 576 interphalangeal (IP) joints. US detected synovial inflammation features were scored as present/absent. US detected bone <b>erosions</b> were also investigated. The association between synovial inflammation features at baseline {{and the development of}} new bone <b>erosions</b> was evaluated using the generalized linear mixed model (GLMM) after adjustment for patient effect, age, gender, body mass index. ResultsIn HOA patients, radiographic scores worsened and bone <b>erosions</b> progressed. In HOA patients similar percentages of joints with Power Doppler Signal (PDS) and gray scale (GS) synovitis were found comparing baseline and follow-up examinations, whilst a significant increase was found in the joints with effusions. Only a minority of joints were positive on both occasions (between 2 and 6 %), the majority fluctuated between positive and negative and vice versa. PDS positivity was associated with new radiographic central <b>erosions</b> and US-detected bone <b>erosions,</b> whereas GS synovitis and effusion were not. ConclusionsRadiographic scores and bone <b>erosions</b> increased over a period of about 4 years.

40|$|Objective. To {{evaluate}} if {{magnetic resonance}} imaging (MRI) is superior to conventional radiography for detection of <b>erosions</b> in the fifth metatarsophalangeal (MTP 5) joint. Methods. Within one year from the onset of rheumatoid arthritis (RA) (baseline), one and three years thereafter MRI and conventional radiographs of the MTP 5 joint were performed in 23 patients. Results. MRI revealed <b>erosions</b> in 10 patients at baseline, in 15 after one year and in 15 patients after 3 years. On conventional radiography, there were <b>erosions</b> in 10 patients at baseline, 16 after one year as well as after 3 years. The agreement between the two imaging methods was fair to good at baseline and after one and three years (kappa 0, 65, 0, 51 and 0, 51 respectively). The number of patients with clinical evidence of synovitis decreased considerably over time {{although the number of}} patients with MRI-synovitis was unchanged and the number of patients with <b>erosions</b> increased. Conclusions. MRI was not superior to conventional radiography in detecting <b>erosions</b> in MTP 5 joints in patients with early RA.

5|$|After {{moderate}} beach <b>erosion</b> {{from previous}} hurricanes Dennis and Floyd, Irene caused significant beach <b>erosion</b> {{on the eastern}} Florida coastline. The <b>erosion</b> exposed the foundations of private homes, leaving some uninhabitable. Beach <b>erosion</b> damage totalled to $21million. Many beach access points were closed until more sand could be pumped in, or until the stairways were rebuilt. Strong north winds and high seas severely destroyed or damaged docks in the Indian River Lagoon. Heavy rainfall, ranging from 5 to 9inches (127 to 229mm) in Martin and St. Lucie Counties flooded 260homes. Strong wind gusts from 60 to 70mph (97 to 113km/h) severely damaged 34houses and caused light damage to 1,114homes in Martin, St. Lucie, and Brevard Counties. In addition the winds damaged 465mobilehomes, 15severely, and destroyed one. 555commercial buildings also experienced light damage, and gusty winds downed about 1,000trees. Rough seas broke a large barge free from its mooring into a bridge on Florida Highway 528.

40|$|In our {{previous}} study, Hizikia fusiformis extract (HFE) has gastroprotective effects in animal model for gastric ulcer. The {{purpose of this}} study was to investigate whether HFE had similar gastro-protective effects in human subjects. A randomized, double-blind, placebo-controlled trial was conducted. To fulfill this purpose, a group of subjects with erosive gastritis were orally supplemented with the HFE or placebo for 4 weeks and efficacy and safety were measured. Primary outcome (number of <b>erosions,</b> endoscopic score and estimated cure rates of <b>erosions)</b> and the secondary outcomes (estimated improvement rates of <b>erosions,</b> subjects’ symptom questionnaires and blood profiles) before and after the 4 -week intervention period were compared. The HFE supplementation showed a significant reduction in number of <b>erosions</b> compared with placebo group. In subjects whose endoscopic score were 4 points (<b>erosions</b> more than 6) at baseline, HFE supplementation resulted in a significant decrease of number of <b>erosions</b> compared with placebo group.

5|$|<b>Erosion</b> can be {{the result}} of {{material}} movement by the wind. There are two main effects. First, wind causes small particles to be lifted and therefore moved to another region. This is called deflation. Second, these suspended particles may impact on solid objects causing <b>erosion</b> by abrasion (ecological succession). Wind <b>erosion</b> generally occurs in areas with little or no vegetation, often in areas where there is insufficient rainfall to support vegetation. An example is the formation of sand dunes, on a beach or in a desert. Loess is a homogeneous, typically nonstratified, porous, friable, slightly coherent, often calcareous, fine-grained, silty, pale yellow or buff, windblown (Aeolian) sediment. It generally occurs as a widespread blanket deposit that covers areas of hundreds of square kilometers and tens of meters thick. Loess often stands in either steep or vertical faces. Loess tends to develop into highly rich soils. Under appropriate climatic conditions, areas with loess are among the most agriculturally productive in the world. Loess deposits are geologically unstable by nature, and will erode very readily. Therefore, windbreaks (such as big trees and bushes) are often planted by farmers to reduce the wind <b>erosion</b> of loess.|$|E
