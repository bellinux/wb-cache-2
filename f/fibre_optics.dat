We show that, for a sufficiently high local dispersion, SC-BP is sufficient to provide a significant performance enhancement when compared to EDC, and is adequate to achieve BER below FEC threshold. For these conditions we report that a sampling rate of two samples per symbol is sufficient for practical SC-BP, without significant penalties. key words: Optical <b>fibre</b> communication, Nonlinear <b>optics,</b> Digital signal processing, coherent communication...|$|R

40|$|The aim of {{the paper}} is to {{investigate}} different techniques used by some companies nowadays involved {{in the production of}} panels or blocks made of translucent cement. For doing that, the patents registered all over the world starting from the 2000 have been studied in deep, in order to acquire more detailed information about the techniques of production and to overcome the limits {{due to the lack of}} information about this subject that is difficult to find in literature. Particularly, patents by LitraConTM, Luccon, Lucem, Italcementi have been investigated; these last four industries are, at the moment, the only ones able to make in Europe translucent cement elements by using different techniques and materials. The translucent cement is certainly one of the most meaningful inventions of the XX century: an innovative material with great application potentialities in Architecture that are limited, at the present, from the costs of the materials used as components and from the complexity of the productive techniques. Really, the innovation is not due to the materials with which the translucent cement is made of (concrete and <b>optics</b> <b>fibres</b> in the “original recipe”concrete and plastic elements in the more recent recipes) but to the new performance that their composition allows to have, especially in relationship to the classes of demands related to the “aspect” and the “safety” of buildings, with obvious relapses on the management and on the comfort of their inner spaces. The light, through the <b>optics</b> <b>fibres</b> or the plastic elements, crosses the concrete panels/blocks allowing them to become translucent and to delineate the profile of objects and people postponed. Translucent concrete is generally used to make coverings, sinks or objects of Design like lamps; only in the Italian Pavilion at the 2010 Shanghai Expo it has been used to build the building envelope by finding, in this way, the celebrity in the world of Architecture even if, in order to see it diffusedly applied in buildings, it will probably need to still wait a lot. The production techniques patented up to now are very different and they have been adopted by different firms that have introduced a variety of product’s typologies on the market. These typologies are related to the dimensions of the elements blocks and/or panels, the performance especially related to the mechanical resistance, the light transmission, the thermal isolation, the costs. Deriving from the analysis of the patents that have been found in the EPO’s website in relation to the European firms that operate in the building market a panning of these techniques of production is showed in this paper...|$|R
40|$|In {{this paper}} we {{describe}} {{a new class}} of silicon photonic crystal fibre (SiPCF) that brings together two powerful optical technologies, the photonic crystal fibre (PCF) and the semiconductor optical fibre. The PCF is now a well established fibre paradigm that {{has proven to be a}} very versatile waveguide and has found applications in nonlinear <b>optics,</b> <b>fibre</b> lasers, and sensors. The versatility of the PCF is due to its microstructured cladding which enables complex manipulation of the waveguide’s characteristics, and also allows for enhanced light interaction with materials that are infiltrated into the cladding voids. The most typical form of semiconductor optical fibre has a fused silica cladding and guides light in the high refractive index semiconductor core. Although semiconductor optical fibres are a nascent technology, practical applications, such as nonlinear pulse shaping and all optical modulation, have begun to emerge in the last couple of years. However, material losses are currently preventing this fibre type from becoming a major disruptive technology and, with this in mind, we present the first steps to decouple the functionality of the semiconductor from its material losses. We achieve this by filling the holes of a modified total internal reflection guiding silica PCF with hydrogenated amorphous silicon (a-Si:H) inclusions. We will show that the resulting SiPCF guides light in the low loss core via the antiresonant reflecting optical waveguiding (ARROW) mechanism. A high-pressure microfluidic chemical deposition technique, as described in [1], was used to fabricate tw...|$|R

40|$|International audienceThe {{monitoring}} of water vapour throughout {{the atmosphere is}} important for many scientific applications (weather forecasting, climate research, calibration of GNSS altimetry measurements). Measuring water vapour remains a technical challenge because of its high variability in space and time. The major issues are achieving long-term stability (e. g., for climate trends monitoring) and high accuracy (e. g. for calibration/validation applications). LAREG and LOEMI at Institut National de l’Information Géographique et Forestière (IGN) have developed a mobile scanning water vapour Raman lidar in collaboration with LATMOS at CNRS. This system aims at providing high accuracy water vapour measurements throughout the troposphere for calibrating GNSS wet delay signals and thus improving vertical positioning. Current developments aim at improving the calibration method and long term stability of the system to allow the Raman lidar {{to be used as}} a reference instrument. The IGN-LATMOS lidar was deployed in the DEMEVAP (Development of Methodologies for Water Vapour Measurement) campaign that took place in 2011 at the Observatoire de Haute Provence. The goals of DEMEVAP were to inter-compare different water vapour sounding techniques (lidars, operational and research radiosondes, GPS,...) and to study various calibration methods for the Raman lidar. A significant decrease of the signals and of the calibration constants of the IGN-LATMOS Raman lidar has been noticed all along the campaign. This led us to study the likely sources of uncertainty and drifts in each part of the instrument: emission, reception and detection. We inventoried several error sources as well as instability sources. The impact of the temperature dependence of the Raman lines on the filter transmission or the fluorescence in the fibre, are examples of the error sources. We investigated each error source and each instability source (uncontrolled laser beam jitter, temporal fluctuations of the photomultiplier gain and spatial inhomogeneity in the sensitivity of the photomultiplier photocathode,...) separately using theoretical analysis, numerical and optical simulations, and laboratory experiments. The instability induced by the use of an <b>optics</b> <b>fibre</b> for coupling the signal collected by the telescope to the detectors is especially investigated. We quantified the impact of all these error sources on the water vapour and nitrogen Raman channels measurements and on the change in the differential calibration constant and we tried to implement an experimental solution to minimize the variation...|$|R
40|$|Photonic crystal fibres (PCF) {{are a new}} {{generation}} of optical fibre that guide light via a periodic air-silica, photonic crystal structure instead of the more traditional step change in refractive index associated with traditional fibre. Careful design of the photonic structure causes the fibres to behave in interesting new ways and one of main aims of this thesis is to begin the investigation of the uses of PCF's in astronomy. Step index and large mode area (LMA) PCF's are introduced in Chapters 2 and 3, respectively. Chapter 4 then deals with the instrumental simplifications {{associated with the use of}} LMA PCF'ร in fibre stellar interferometry showing that up to four step index <b>fibres</b> and associated <b>optics</b> can be replaced with a single LMA fibre. One of the key features of LMA fibres, for astronomy, is that, unlike the step index fibre, the mode field size is independent of wavelength and the fibre can therefore be fed with a pupil image via a field lens. Chapter 5 investigates this important new parameter space showing that contiguous sampling using single mode fibres is now possible for the first time. Further, unlike the direct feed to the LMA fibre, maximised coupling over very large wavebands is now possible using just a single fibre. Chapter 6 deals with another new fibre technology in astronomy: Multi-mode fibre (MMF) to single-mode array (SMA) transitions. These fibre systems break out the modes of the multi-mode fibre into an array of single-mode fibres upon which Bragg gratings can be etched. The SMA is then refused into an output MMF resulting in a multimode device but with single-mode line suppression. The number of modes transmitted is numerically equal to the number of fibres in the SMA and the performance of these devices is investigated on a model telescope showing that only a few tens of modes is required to efficiently transmit either the J or н bands. Finally, Chapter 7 details the experimental investigation of fibre modal noise in high dispersion spectroscopy. This is a photometric error on a resolution element due to fibre modes interfering with each other at very high spectral dispersion. Worryingly, the results show that no current theory exists that can predict the performance of a fibre based high R spectrometer. EThOS - Electronic Theses Online ServiceGBUnited Kingdo...|$|R
40|$|Abstract This thesis {{describes}} {{the development of}} high bandwidth (~ 1 GHz) TOF (time-of-flight) laser range finder techniques for industrial measurement applications in the measurement range of zero to a few dozen metres to diffusely reflecting targets. The main goal has been to improve single-shot precision to mm-level in order to shorten the measurement result acquisition time. A TOF laser range finder consists of a laser transmitter, one or two receivers and timing discriminators, and a time measuring unit. In order to improve single-shot precision the slew-rate of the measurement pulse should be increased, so the optical pulse of the laser transmitter should be narrower and more powerful and the bandwidth of the receiver should be higher without increasing the noise level too much. In the transmitter usually avalanche transistors are used for generating the short (3 – 10 ns) and powerful (20 – 100 A) current pulses for the semiconductor laser. Several avalanche transistor types were compared and the optimization of the switching circuit was studied. It was shown that as high as 130 A current pulses are achievable using commercially available surface mount avalanche transistors. The timing discriminator was noticed to give the minimum walk error, when high slew rate measurement pulses and a high bandwidth comparator were used. A walk error of less than +/- 1 mm in an input amplitude dynamic range higher than 1 : 10 can be achieved with a high bandwidth receiver channel. Adding an external offset voltage between the input nodes of the comparator additionally minimized the walk error. A prototype ~ 1 GHz laser range finder constructed in the thesis consists of a laser pulser and two integrated ASIC receiver channels with silicon APDs (avalanche photodiodes), crossover timing discriminators and Gilbert cell attenuators. The laser pulser utilizes an internal Q-switching mode of a commercially available SH-laser and produces optical pulses with a pulse peak power and FWHM (full-width-at-half-maximum) of 44 W and 74 ps, respectively. Using single-axis optics and 1 m long multimode <b>fibres</b> between the <b>optics</b> and receivers a total accuracy of +/- 2 mm in the measurement range of 0. 5 – 34. 5 m was measured. The single-shot precision (σ-value) was 14 ps– 34 ps (2 – 5 mm) in the measurement range. The single-shot precision agrees well with the simulations and is better with a factor of about 3 - 5 as compared to earlier published pulsed TOF laser radars in comparable measuring conditions...|$|R
