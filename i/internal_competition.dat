5|$|In 1979, PSA {{decided that}} their new small Talbot {{would also be}} based on the 104 rather than the Horizon. Keeping the common {{underpinnings}} allowed the new model, known internally as project C15 (later renamed to T15 to reflect the brand change from Chrysler to Talbot) to be launched in 1981, in time to replace the Sunbeam when Linwood would close. In order not to create too much <b>internal</b> <b>competition,</b> a wheelbase between the 3 door and 5 door versions of the 104 was chosen. This made the projected model slot in size slightly below popular superminis such as the Ford Fiesta, but above the city cars, including the about-to-be-launched Austin Metro.|$|E
5|$|In 1982, the Talbot Group was {{merged into}} Peugeot within PSA, and {{responsibility}} for the model was devolved to France. The Whitley design studio was dissolved, {{and some of the}} designers crossed over to British Leyland, where they joined their former boss Roy Axe. PSA had by then already started work on a replacement for the Samba, based on the Citroën AX, a few prototypes of which—essentially rebadged AXs—were created in 1983/84. The Samba sold reasonably well throughout 1982 and 1983, after which sales began to suffer, partly because of the model's aging and partly because of competition from the very popular Peugeot 205, which created powerful (and successful) <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> within PSA for the little Talbot.|$|E

25|$|Nevertheless, in both {{alternative}} concepts, {{the system}} will not survive due to the <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> among its constituents. Even if none of the constituents of such a system is selectively favoured, which potentially allows coexistence {{of all of the}} coupled molecules, they are not able to coevolve and optimize their properties. In consequence, the system loses its internal stability and cannot live on. The reason for inability to survive is the lack of mutual control of constituent abundances.|$|E
25|$|No MD-90 {{orders were}} {{received}} after Boeing and McDonnell Douglas merged in 1997 due to <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> with Boeing's 737. Delta Air Lines had initially placed a large {{order for the}} MD-90 to replace some aging Boeing 727s. After the Boeing-McDonnell Douglas merger, Delta canceled their remaining 19 MD-90 orders {{in favor of the}} Boeing 737-800. A total of 40 MD-90s (later 20) were to be assembled under contract in Shanghai, People's Republic of China under the Trunkliner program, but Boeing's decision to phase out the MD-90 resulted in only two built by Shanghai Aircraft.|$|E
25|$|The Classic {{line was}} {{discontinued}} {{in the middle}} of the 1976 model year. VAM was looking forward to introducing the Pacer model to Mexican market, which would represent its fourth product line, while Mexican legislation at the time allowed only three per marque. Having both the Classic and the Pacer in the luxury market segment would have also caused <b>internal</b> <b>competition.</b> VAM favored the new Pacer over what until that time had been its flagship model. Starting in 1977, VAM's most luxurious model was the Pacer, and its largest sized models were the Americans (AMC Hornets).|$|E

25|$|A {{prototype}} convertible Sable {{was displayed}} at the 1988 North American International Auto Show, featuring a custom two-door body with a power folding top that was built off a production sedan chassis. It never reached production, and the convertible prototype was sold on eBay in 2006. A high-performance LTS model {{that would be a}} counterpart to the Taurus SHO was also planned but later shelved out of fears that it would create unnecessary <b>internal</b> <b>competition.</b> A special edition Sable commemorating the 50th anniversary of Mercury that was sold in 1989 used the performance chassis developed for the LTS; only 50 of these were produced. The Sable was also extensively used in Ford's Aluminum Intensive Vehicle (AIV) program, which built 20 aluminum-bodied Sables with Taurus SHO V6 engines in an engineering exercise for constructing all-aluminum unit bodies, like that which saw production by Audi in 1994.|$|E
25|$|The {{introduction}} of the Gremlin line by VAM in 1974, which became the company's smallest and most affordable model, created {{a gap between the}} lower end Rambler American line and the larger, top Classic (Matador) line; the situation was also applicable to the performance Javelin line despite being discontinued in 1973. The difference in size and engine series between the Rambler American and the Gremlin was not enough for VAM to create the impression of a more solid and more importantly a diverse product line since both cars were perceived as belonging to the same economy level, which would also mean the creation of <b>internal</b> <b>competition.</b> The VAM Rambler American was restricted to the economy segment since its introduction to the Mexican market, the only exceptions to this being the luxury limited edition Rambler American Hartop (Rambler American 440H in US) for 1963 and 1965, as well as the sporty Rambler American Rally (Rambler American Rogue and Hornet Rallye X/Hornet X in US) from 1969 through 1974. The model was shifted from the economy to the mid-segment, as an all-new generation introduced for 1975. This didn't just readjust the company's full product line, but was also an opportunity to rejuvenate the compact line itself. By this time, the Hornet-based Rambler American had been on the market for five years and saw continued sales and positive image. The name was simplified from Rambler American to just American, marking the discontinuation of the Rambler brand in Mexico. The greatest change was the creation of the new luxury American ECD trim level followed by a revised and improved American Rally and American base models, which helped to distance the line further from the Gremlin. The cars in all versions obtained substantial updates and upgrades.|$|E

Bequelin notes that their function is to channel a specific view of China to an international audience, and their fundamental premise remains the same; that all information broadcast must reflect the government's views. The Chinese government encouraged the adaption of Western style media marketing in their news agencies due to <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> with national commercial media.|$|E

2500|$|Lucille Ball and Desi Arnaz were {{instrumental}} in forming the exclusive Thunderbird Heights tract in Rancho Mirage, once the home of President Gerald Ford and his wife Betty. According to Palm Springs Life magazine, that same tract inspired the name in late 1954 for the Ford Thunderbird. The magazine incorrectly cites that a favorite vacation spot for General Motors executives, Palm Desert's Eldorado Country Club, inspired the name for Cadillac's top model the year before — though Cadillac had chosen the name five years before the club's founding in an <b>internal</b> <b>competition.</b> Local automotive history inidcates that designer Raymond Loewy penned the Studebaker Avanti in his Palm Springs home.

2500|$|Altepetl {{states would}} {{normally}} strive to dominate neighboring altepetl through warfare. Weak altepetl would be subjugated by stronger ones {{and made to}} pay tribute. Often subordinate altepetl would form alliances in order to overthrow a dominant altepetl. Some alliances were short-lived and others were long term relationships wherein a group of altepetl would converge to form what could almost be considered a single political entity. One example of a long term alliance between independent city-states would be that between the four altepetl of Tlaxcallan, Ocotelolco, Tizatlan, Quiyahuiztlan and Tepeticpac, which is normally {{thought of as a}} single entity even though it had four independent rulers and a certain level of <b>internal</b> <b>competition.</b> Another is the so-called [...] Aztec Triple Alliance between Tlacopan, Texcoco and Tenochtitlan which was originally formed to end the dominance of the altepetl Azcapotzalco. The Aztec Triple Alliance eventually achieved political hegemony and control over the greater part of Mesoamerica, becoming known to posterity as the Aztec empire. Recent studies have countered the claim that the Aztec Empire ran the triple alliance by suggesting that Tenochtitlan was actually the dominant altepetl all along.|$|E
2500|$|For 1976, VAM {{introduced}} the Gremlin X {{for the first}} time in Mexico, retaking the economical sporty concept originally held by the Rally model. The company's engineers started to find solutions to the problem of lack of power without rising gas emission, and the 258 six obtained a higher 8.0:1 compression ratio this year. Due to this improvement along with the subcompact's lighter body and shorter exhaust, the 1976 Gremlin X outperformed the low-compression 1975 American Rally, despite that it wasn't offered with the new four-speed transmission. To avoid <b>internal</b> <b>competition</b> once again in both performance models as well as further pushing of the line's concept change, VAM proceeded to upgrade the American Rally to distance it from the new subcompact version. The 1976 models switched to the [...] 7.7:1 compression ratio VAM 282 cu in six cylinder with Holley 2300 two-barrel carburetor and 266 degree camshaft, shared with the VAM Pacer and all Classic models. This marked {{for the first time}} the presence of VAM's largest engine in the Hornet-based compact line. The works on solving the shortage of power on the 258 six were still in process in the 282, thus the existing version was installed under the hood. The 1976 American Rally in the performance department fared much better with its higher displacement, large-diameter valves, larger intake manifold and larger carburetor but was still falling short on compression ratio. The model outperformed all of its predecessors. However, there was an exception in the form of the 1972 Rambler American Rally with its 9.5:1 compression ratio 252 cu in six, which was still half a second faster despite its high-flow one-barrel carburetor, small intake manifold, three-speed transmission, higher rear gear ratio and lower displacement. Aside from the engine, the 1976 American Rally was accompanied by noticeable improvements consisting of power front disk brakes, power steering and tinted windshield, all as standard equipment. The four-speed transmission and heater were fully standardized this year. New seat patterns and side panel designs (without the etched Rally emblem) were used, while gauges were changed to a 160km/h speedometer and 6,000 RPM tachometer. New dome light lens design and longer sunvisors were shared with the American and Gremlin. The new engine and standard equipment coupled with the mid-year discontinuation of the 1976 Classic AMX (Matador X) ascended the American Rally into the top of the line performance model of the company. The sportiness and concept was fairly close to that of the 1972-1976 VAM Javelins and aforementioned Classic AMXs. With the engine change, the rear quarter panel emblems morphed into [...] "4.6" [...] units. After only one year, the model name [...] "Rally" [...] emblem on the rear panel was once again redesigned.|$|E
