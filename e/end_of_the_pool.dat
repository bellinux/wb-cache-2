5|$|The {{position}} of the goalkeeper has existed since the game of water polo originated. At that time, {{the object of the}} game was to touch the ball on the opponent's <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> The goalkeeper would wait at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> until an opposing player approached the goal, when the goalkeeper would try to stop that player, for example, by dunking their head.|$|E
5|$|A change {{occurred}} {{in the game and}} the role of the goalkeeper in the 1880s, when the Scottish reduced the size of the scoring area by placing rugby posts, spaced about 10 feet apart, at each <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool.</b> At the same time, the rules were changed to allow goalkeepers to stand on the pool deck and leap onto the head of an opposing player who approached the goal. This change in the rules was brief. To prevent the serious injuries that resulted from this method of goalkeeping, the rules were revised again to require the goalie to remain in the water.|$|E
5|$|From the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> steps lead down to {{a smaller}} {{rectangular}} pool at right-angles to the first. The steps and the retaining wall {{at the end of}} the terrace are listed at GradeII. The retaining walls of the pool are also listed at GradeII. This area contains two statues by Jonathan Kenworthy. From this pool a path, known as the Broad Walk, stretches to the north and the south. At each end of the Broad Walk is a building designed by Waterhouse for the 3rdMarquess. At the north end is the Parrot House, dating from 1881–83, which is built in yellow terracotta. It is the form of a round colonnaded Ionic temple with a shallow domed roof. Above the colonnade and the inner drum are concentric balustrades. A flight of eleven steps leads up to the south entrance. The Parrot House is listed at GradeII. At the south end of the Broad Walk is a loggia, dating from about 1880. This is built in buff and red sandstone. At its front are three arches between Ionic columns. The loggia was built to enclose a Roman altar which was found in 1821 at a spring near Boughton and brought to Eaton in 1822. The loggia is listed at GradeII. To the east and west of the loggia are reconstructed Roman columns, each of which is listed at GradeII.|$|E

25|$|In 1310 Bishop Langton built a {{causeway}} on Bird Street splitting a {{much larger}} pool into two, these became known as Bishops Fish Pool on the west and Minster Pool on the east.

Langton {{is thought to have}} improved and enlarged the dam at the east <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> at this time. The south entrance to the Close was located at the east end of Minster Pool on Dam Street and consisted of a portcullis and drawbridge.

25|$|By {{elevating}} head-to-head results (rule i) above points difference (rule ii), {{a notable}} difference is created to other sports competitions, in which points difference usually determines rank for teams {{with the same}} number of match points (table points). These rules allowed the winners of Pools A, B and C to be determined by the results of the third pool matches on the weekend of 22 and 23 September. Although other teams could theoretically draw level on table points with South Africa, Australia and New Zealand and exceed their points differences at the <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool</b> stages, head-to-head results by that time ensured these teams could be declared winners of their respective pools, with a match to spare.

25|$|At Saxilby, the Manchester, Sheffield and Lincolnshire Railway {{crosses the}} waterway, to {{run along the}} south bank {{all the way to}} Lincoln. There was once a swing bridge beyond the railway bridge, which was removed in 1937, {{although}} the foundations are still obvious. Access over the canal at this point was re-instated in 1987, when a footbridge was installed. The original bridge was manufactured in 1884, and crossed the Great Northern Railway at Newark-on-Trent for 103 years before it was put to a new use. The A57 crosses to the north bank soon after the railway bridge. The River Till flows south and under the road to join the Fossdyke, after which a new marina has been built at Burton Meadows. Because the construction has breached the flood bank, it is protected by a flood gate. The canal crosses under the A46 road on the outskirts of Lincoln, and then over a drainage ditch, to run alongside the Carholme golf club. The final bridge carries the B1273 Brayford Way over the canal as it enters Brayford Pool, once a busy commercial wharf in the centre of Lincoln, but now a marina with the University on the southern bank. The unnavigable River Witham flows into the bottom <b>end</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>pool,</b> and becomes the Witham Navigation when it flows out on its way to Boston.|$|E

500|$|There {{are three}} {{additional}} classes, S11, S12 and S13, for visually impaired swimmers.

A final class, S14, is for intellectually disabled swimmers. This class was not contested at the 2004 and the 2008 Summer Paralympics after the IPC dropped all intellectual disability events following the basketball ID controversy at the 2000 Summer Paralympics, but was restored for the 2012 Summer Paralympics.|$|E
