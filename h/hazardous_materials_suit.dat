Such suits are often combined with self-contained breathing apparatus (SCBA) to ensure a supply of breathable air. Hazmat suits are mostly used by firefighters, Emergency Medical Technicians, Paramedics, researchers, personnel responding to toxic spills, specialists cleaning up contaminated facilities, and workers in toxic environments.|$|E

In order to create their art installations the Kurtzes sometimes worked with biological equipment and had a small home lab and petri dishes containing biological specimens. At the time of Hope Kurtz's death they were working on an exhibit about genetically modified agriculture for the Massachusetts Museum of Contemporary Art. Buffalo police deemed these materials suspicious and notified the FBI, who detained Kurtz for 22 hours without charge on suspicion of [...] "bioterrorism."

Under suspicion since the release of the prior suspect, Dutschke denied the allegations through his lawyer. Saying that new information had been discovered in the case, authorities who have had his house under surveillance arrested Dutschke {{in the early hours of}} April 27. Later that day, Dutschke was charged with attempted use of a biological weapon. [...] On June 3, 2013, Dutschke was indicted by a federal grand jury on five counts. [...] He was indicted for producing and using the deadly toxin as a weapon, and using the mail to threaten President Obama, Sen. Roger Wicker of Mississippi and Lee County Judge Sadie Holland.|$|R
2500|$|Gordon wears {{a special}} {{full-body}} hazmat suit, {{known as the}} Hazardous Environment Suit (or HEV Suit), during combat. The suit is {{designed to protect the}} user from radiation, energy discharges, and blunt trauma during the handling of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials.</b> The <b>suit's</b> main feature is its [...] "high-impact reactive armor", an electrically powered armor system that, when charged, absorbs two-thirds of the damage that Gordon would ordinarily suffer. A fully charged suit can survive several dozen hits from small arms and even one direct hit from an RPG. The suit can be charged by various means, and has its own oxygen supply and medical injectors, such as morphine and a neurotoxin antidote. It comes with a built-in flashlight, a radio, various tracking devices, a compass, and a Geiger counter. The suit contains an on-board computer system that constantly monitors the user's health and vital signs, and reacts to any changes in the user's condition. It also projects a heads-up display (HUD) which displays Gordon's health and suit charge level, remaining ammunition, and a crosshair.|$|R

The inherent interrelationships between the emerging <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> logistical problems imply the integration of routing and emergency response logistical decisions in order to improve the effectiveness of the <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> emergency response process. The proposed system contributes substantially to this objective by providing the following capabilities: (i) provision of alternative efficient <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> distribution routes in terms of minimum cost and risk, (ii) identification of the emergency response units locations that minimise the incident response time and secure a predefined service level for <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> incidents, (iii) routing of the emergency response units, and (iv) identification of optimum evacuation plans i. e. optimum evacuation paths and traffic assignment given the evacuation area.

40|$|The {{transportation}} of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> keeps increasing across the United States {{due to the}} growing consumption of goods and rising need for manufactured materials. Furthermore, concerns are mounting over the safe surface {{transportation of}} <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials.</b> Highways and rails {{are the most common}} modes of transport for <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials,</b> although the risk posed from highway transport of <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials</b> may be higher {{due to the fact that}} highways are public while rails are mostly private. The majority of <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> cargo is carried on the highway network by trucks. Due to possible adverse effects on human and animal populations in the event of an accident involving <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials,</b> there is a need for the development of a highway route risk assessment tool that precisely represents transportation risks associated with hazardous cargos and to build a framework for designating a set of risky routes based on different factors. The research presented in this thesis explains a methodology to analyze the spatial patterns of truck accident data, discern potentially risky routes of truck traffic carrying <b>hazardous</b> <b>materials,</b> and estimate the impact area of an identified risky route by quantifying the human population affected in that area. Lancaster County in Nebraska was used as the study area and the <b>hazardous</b> <b>material</b> exposure from a theoretical truck-involved accident was estimated.
