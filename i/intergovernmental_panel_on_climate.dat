Likewise, he points to Indigenous knowledge that conceptualises human interconnectedness with the earth as gift-reciprocity relationships and as a model for social relationships. The famous Indigenous artwork Spirit of Haida Gwaii remains exemplary of democratic and pluralistic ways of thinking and acting - between humans and the natural environments on which they depend.|$|R
40|$|This sourcebook is {{designed}} to be a guide to develop a reference emission and design a 193 system for monitoring and estimating carbon dioxide emissions from deforestation and 194 forest degradation at the national scale, based on the general requirements set by the 195 United Nation Framework Convention <b>on</b> <b>Climate</b> Change (UNFCCC) and the specific 196 methodologies for the land use and forest sectors provided by the <b>Intergovernmental</b> 197 <b>Panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>Climate</b> Change (IPCC). 198 The sourcebook introduces users to: i) the key issues and challenges related to 199 monitoring and estimating carbon emissions from deforestation and forest degradation; 200 ii) the key methods provided in the 2003 IPCC Good Practice Guidance for Land Use, 201 Land Use Change and Forestry (GPG-LULUCF) and the 2006 IPCC Guidelines for National 202 Greenhouse Gas Inventories for Agriculture, Forestry and Other Land Uses (GL-AFOLU); 203 iii) how these IPCC methods provide the steps needed to estimate emissions from 204 deforestation and forest degradation and iv) the key issues and challenges related to 205 reporting the estimated emissions. 206 The sourcebook provides transparent methods and procedures that are designed to 207 produce accurate estimates of changes in forest area and carbon stocks and resulting 208 emissions of carbon dioxide from deforestation and degradation, in a format that is user- 209 friendly. It is intended to complement the GPG-LULUCF and AFOLU by providing 210 additional explanation, clarification and enhanced methodologies for obtaining and 211 analyzing key data. 212 The sourcebook is not designed as a primer on how to analyze remote sensing data nor 213 how to collect field measurements of forest carbon stocks as it is expected that the users 214 of this sourcebook would have some expertise in either of these areas.

40|$|This thesis aims {{to improve}} the current {{understanding}} of the processes which control the flow variability of Greenland Ice Sheet (GrIS) outlet glaciers. The most recent <b>Intergovernmental</b> Governmental <b>Panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>Climate</b> Change (IPCC) report (Meehl et al., 2007) identifies that a critical limitation to forecasts of sea-level rise are uncertainties in modelling the ice dynamics of the GrIS. Using Synthetic Aperture Radar (SAR) feature tracking, seasonal velocities of land- and marine- terminating glaciers in a region in the northeast of Greenland are measured. Records of air temperature in conjunction with seasonal observations of supraglacial lake development, sea ice conditions and ice front positions, derived from SAR imagery, are used to investigate the controls on the observed variations in ice velocity. A clear link between ice velocities and glacier hydrology is found. These {{findings are consistent with}} observations from other glaciers in Greenland and are suggestive of a universal hydrological forcing of ice velocity for the whole of the GrIS ablation zone. Lake drainage events have been identified as a key factor in linking atmospheric changes, glacier hydrology and ice velocities in Greenland. For modelling purposes, a means of parameterising the distribution and evolution of supraglacial lakes is therefore needed. Assuming that water will pond in surface depressions, this thesis assesses the ability of using Digital Elevation Models (DEMs) for this purpose. High resolution DEMs are created using Interferometric SAR (InSAR) for two, separate regions of the GrIS. The positions and areal extent of surface depressions are compared with those of lakes observed in optical satellite imagery. The level of correspondence between the two datasets is found to be poor {{as a result of the}} resolution of the DEMs and the physical differences between surface depressions and lakes (e. g. lakes may not fill the capacity of the depression). An alternative method for parameterising the seasonal distribution of supra-glacial lakes, by extrapolating trends observed in current lake distributions, is investigated. The locations and evolution of lakes in the west of Greenland during the summer of 2003 are mapped using 47 Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) images. Clear trends are identified in the distributions of lakes with elevation and are linked to the seasonal melt-cycle and to changes in ice thickness and its influence on surface depressions, tensile stresses and hydrofracturing. It may be possible to extrapolate these trends to other regions and higher elevations on the ice sheet, thereby enabling the distribution of lakes to be parameterised in ice sheet models. The findings of this thesis help to contribute to the understanding of the interaction between climate and ice dynamics in the context of the GrIS.

A lack of success in the first two decades of UN work in this area led to the 1992 Earth Summit in Rio de Janeiro, Brazil, which sought to give new impetus to these efforts. In 1988, the UNEP and the World Meteorological Organization (WMO), another UN organization, established the <b>Intergovernmental</b> <b>Panel</b> <b>on</b> <b>Climate</b> Change, which assesses and reports on research on global warming.
