6000|$|... 'Please, ma'am, should <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{she is not}} {{a school}} manager?' inquired the mistress, {{somewhat}} indignantly, when the two ladies had departed.|$|E
6000|$|... "May <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{you forgive}} her?" [...] the Vicar asked, {{as they were}} walking {{together}} {{up and down the}} station in the Waterloo Road.|$|E
6000|$|... "Not yet, Jeanne. But {{mother will}} look upon you as her {{daughter}} directly <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you {{have promised to}} become so in reality some day." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "May I {{go and see}} her?" [...] said Dorothea, eagerly. [...] "Would she {{accept my}} sympathy? <b>I</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{you have not been}} blamable before any one's {{judgment}} but your own. <b>I</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you shall be cleared in every fair mind. I would cheer her heart. Will you ask her if I may go to see her? I did see her once." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well-no. <b>I</b> did <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> part, {{but that}} was nothing. It was about Burnamy and Agatha that she knew. She saw it from the first." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Mamma! Oh, gracious, no. Mamma's far {{too slow}} for <b>that.</b> But <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Santa Claus insisted on {{putting in the}} little money boxes." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That {{would be}} the best way," [...] Harry agreed. [...] "Yes, if I see she won't be calm and do as <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her,</b> <b>that</b> is what I will do." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She said to me," [...] Whamond continued, [...] "that {{the women}} o' the {{congregation}} would be fond {{to handle the}} hair. Could <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> the women was waur agin him than the men? I shivered to hear her.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, {{you gave}} us both quite a start, and Hilda said we must either give up talking silently or let you into our secret; so I don't think {{that she will be}} vexed when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> I have let it out." ...|$|E
60|$|She had me {{with the}} first shot. I couldn't think of {{anything}} to say. <b>I</b> couldn't <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Rocky was down in the country, watching worms.|$|R
6000|$|... "Whether {{you claim}} it or not," [...] he said, [...] "you are really her guardian, not Arnold. <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you left <b>her</b> free to choose." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "But I must let {{her know}} of this arrangement. <b>I</b> must <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you hold out hopes to us on {{condition}} that we keep apart for a time." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Careful!" [...] he repeated. [...] "She isn't {{likely to}} be even civil to me {{tomorrow}} when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> I have seen you and I refuse to give her your address. Careful, indeed! What has a poor clerk in a house-agent's office to fear from such a personage?" ...|$|E
60|$|Margaret and I are {{agreed that}} sulphur, {{excessively}} inhaled, leaves the lungs sore. Only now, after a lapse {{of a dozen}} hours, can we draw breath in anything that resembles comfort. But still my lungs were not so sore as to prevent my telling her what I had learned she meant to me. And yet she is only a woman--I tell her so; <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{there are at least}} seven hundred and fifty millions of two-legged, long-haired, gentle-voiced, soft-bodied, female humans like her on the planet, and that she is really swamped by the immensity of numbers of her sex and kind. But I tell her something more. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> of all of them she is the only one. And, better yet, to myself and for myself, I believe it. I know it. The last least part of me and all of me proclaims it.|$|E
6000|$|... "Ah; that is {{just what}} I fear. That is what I say to Bell when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> her romance will fade as the roses do. And then I shall have to learn that prose is more {{serviceable}} than poetry, and that the mind {{is better than the}} heart, and--and that money is better than love. It's all coming, I know; and yet I do like the moonlight." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That's good," [...] said Ippegoo, [...] "then she can't and won't go to Puffin Island. I said <b>I</b> would <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> Angut {{wants to}} meet her there alone." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No. <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you haven't slept. Go to bed now, {{and try to}} {{get some}} rest. She isn't up herself yet. You must have some breakfast." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "It was the period, too. <b>I</b> always <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{she belongs}} among the later {{eighteen}} sixties. But she insists that she wasn't even born then. Marion is tremendously single-minded." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No, {{she has not}} {{proposed}} it. But {{she talks}} of it, saying {{that it would not}} do. Then when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> of course it would not do, she shows me all that would make it expedient. She is so sly and so false, that with all my eyes open I cannot quite understand her, or quite know what she is doing. I do not feel sure that she wishes it herself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "She {{looks after}} every one's health but her own," [...] said Miss Birdseye, smiling. [...] "When <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that,</b> {{she says she}} hasn't got any to look after. She says she's {{the only woman in}} Boston that hasn't got a doctor. She was {{determined}} she wouldn't be a patient, and {{it seemed as if the}} only way not to be one was to be a doctor. She is trying to make me sleep; that's her principal occupation." ...|$|E
6000|$|In vain do <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{writing is}} as {{pleasant}} {{to me as}} ever was {{the prospect of a}} tremendous day’s ironing to her; that (to some, though not to me) new chapters are as easy to turn out as new bannocks. No, she maintains, for one bannock is the marrows of another, while chapters—and then, perhaps, her eyes twinkle, and says she saucily, ‘But, sal, you may be right, for sometimes your bannocks are as alike as mine!’ ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I am forgetting my errand," [...] {{he said to}} Alban. [...] "Miss Emily {{was anxious}} {{to know if you}} had {{finished}} your sketch. <b>I</b> must <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you have returned." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I cannot {{believe my}} eyes!" [...] He ran wildly to the door. [...] "Where is my wife? <b>I</b> must <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> all is well. Hilda! Hilda!" [...] we {{heard his voice}} on the stairs.|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>I</b> met you, {{and that}} you are well, and, if Philip will allow me, <b>I</b> will <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> more; but of course I don't know if he will or not. What ring is that you wear?" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "And your daughter,--how shall I dare to {{meet her}} eye?" [...] exclaimed Reuben. [...] "She will ask the fate of her father, whose life I vowed to defend with my own. Must <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> he {{travelled}} three days' march with me {{from the field of}} battle and that then I left him to perish in the wilderness? Were it not better to lie down and die by your side than to return safe and say this to Dorcas?" ...|$|E
6000|$|DEAR MR. HALL,--Yours of Dec. 19 is to hand, and Mrs. Clemens {{is deeply}} distressed, for she thinks I have been blaming you or finding fault {{with you about}} something. But most surely that cannot be. <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{although}} I am prone to write hasty and regrettable things to other people, I am not a bit likely to write such things to you. I can't believe I have done anything so ungrateful. If I have, pile coals of fire on my head, for I deserve it! ...|$|E
6000|$|... "As for the kindness, it is nothing," [...] Jacques replied; [...] "and beside that, {{you saved}} my life from that snake. I dream {{sometimes}} of the beast still. And it was really owing to you that I am here now, and that I shall get a round sum coming to me when I return home. If it hadn't been for you I {{should not have been}} chosen to stop behind and get three shares instead of one of the prize money. And in the next place it is your doing that I am free to start at once, and to make my way back as soon as I can, instead of spending four or five years, it may be, in an English prison. Why, my Louise will be ready to jump for joy when she sees me arrive, instead of having to wait another two years for me, with the chance of my never coming back at all; and she will hardly believe me when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> I shall be able to afford to buy that fishing boat and set up in a house of our own at once; and she will be most surprised of all when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> it is all owing to an English boy I fished on board on a dark night in the channel." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Pshaw! That's missish nonsense, Mary, and {{you know}} it. If a girl were to tell me {{she fell in love}} because she couldn't help it, <b>I</b> should <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she wasn't worth any man's love." ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> {{wanted to}} <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> if <b>I</b> could do {{anything}} at all, she had only to command.|$|R
6000|$|... "Very well," [...] {{said the}} other; [...] "my wife {{is guided by}} me in such matters, and I am very happy {{to say that she}} is an obedient wife, and <b>I</b> shall <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> she is to curtsey to your wife in future." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "This {{woman is}} my wife," [...] he said. [...] "In the {{presence}} of you three, as witnesses, <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> I don't forgive her. I have brought her here--having no other place in which I can trust her to be--to wait the issue of proceedings, undertaken in defense of my own honor and good name. While she stays here, she will live separate from me, in a room of her own. If {{it is necessary for}} me to communicate with her, I shall only see her in {{the presence of}} a third person. Do you all understand me?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I suppose I {{had better}} look at the letter,' he said to himself. 'I would rather Danvers did not write so often. Dorothy looks up inquiringly {{whenever}} the post comes in, and I would rather say [...] "No letter to-day," [...] than to have to say, [...] "There is a letter from Danvers, Dorothy, but he sends no news whatever." [...] It comes to the same thing, no doubt, but no letter might mean that they had got some little clue and meant following it up. At any rate, she does not look so disappointed as when <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> there is a letter with nothing in it.' ...|$|E
6000|$|How could <b>I</b> <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> {{what she}} had said had {{astonished}} me, had distressed me, had suggested to me that she {{was in a state of}} dangerous nervous excitement, had even roused a moment's doubt in my mind whether the loss of the jewel was as much a mystery to her as to the rest of us--but had never once given me so much as a glimpse at the truth? Without the shadow of a proof to produce in vindication of my innocence, how could I persuade her that I knew no more than the veriest stranger could have known of what was really in her thoughts when she spoke to me on the terrace? ...|$|E
5000|$|... "If {{she asks}} you, please, <b>I</b> beg you, <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> <b>her</b> {{scarecrow}} husband, I mean, the lecturer, me, behaved with dignity." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'She oughtn't to have come. <b>I</b> should <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> just <b>that.</b> You {{might send}} the maid to <b>her</b> to <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> <b>that</b> you couldn't see her again.' ...|$|R
60|$|<b>I</b> did <b>tell</b> <b>her</b> all <b>that</b> had happened, {{speaking}} as mildly as I could of Mr. Enderton's conduct. Poor Ruth burst into tears.|$|R
