5|$|The {{king and}} queen were not pleased with married life. The royal couple enjoyed periods of calm and affection, but Anne refused to play the {{submissive}} role expected of her. The vivacity and opinionated intellect that had made her so attractive as an illicit lover made her too independent for the largely ceremonial role of a royal wife and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> many enemies. For his part, Henry disliked Anne's constant irritability and violent temper. After a false pregnancy or miscarriage in 1534, he saw her failure {{to give him a}} son as a betrayal. As early as Christmas 1534, Henry was discussing with Cranmer and Cromwell the chances of leaving Anne without having to return to Catherine. Henry is traditionally believed to have had an affair with Margaret ("Madge") Shelton in 1535, although historian Antonia Fraser argues that Henry in fact had an affair with her sister Mary Shelton.|$|E
25|$|Hathaway starred {{alongside}} Heath Ledger and Jake Gyllenhaal in Ang Lee's drama Brokeback Mountain (2005). It won {{rave reviews}} and received several Academy Award nominations. Hathaway later {{stated that the}} content of the film was more important than its award count and that making <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> more aware of the kind of stories she wanted to tell as an actress.|$|E
25|$|Zheng Jie {{keeps in}} a small vial pieces of her ankle bone that were removed during the ankle surgery of 2007. She says she keeps {{it because it is}} a part of her, and that it makes her cherish being able to play tennis again and life in general. She says that {{although}} <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> world ranking plunge, it also made her grow up a lot.|$|E
60|$|Ingleby smiled again, in {{a manner}} which while kind enough had yet a lack of {{comprehension}} in <b>it</b> that <b>made</b> <b>her</b> still angrier.|$|R
6000|$|... "I ain't afraid," [...] and Bab {{was about}} to assume her boldest look when a sneeze spoilt <b>it,</b> and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> clutch the gate to hold on.|$|R

25|$|After finally {{stabilizing}} in late summer, Babyshambles' lineup underwent another {{change in}} January 2005. On 27 January 2005, drummer Gemma Clarke quit the band after disagreeing with their management. The ongoing heavy drug {{abuse of the}} band members, especially of frontman Doherty, and James Mullord's inability {{to do something about}} <b>it,</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> eventually leave the band. She was immediately replaced by Adam Ficek, who was once a band member of the White Sport alongside Patrick Walden.|$|E
25|$|In the 1986 season she was fifth at the 1986 European Athletics Indoor Championships {{and then}} sixth at the 1986 European Athletics Championships – her highest placing yet {{at an outdoor}} European final. A {{lifetime}} best run of 12.69 seconds in Moscow was a French record that lasted for nine years. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> the eighth fastest hurdler that season. She gave her best performance on the global stage the following year {{with a time of}} 12.83 seconds in the final at the 1987 World Championships in Athletics.|$|E
25|$|She {{became a}} fan of hip hop music {{at the age of}} 14 and {{improved}} her English by listening and rapping along to famous American rappers such as Eminem. At the age of 15, she started hanging out with lots of bad guys, which made her parents worry about her and therefore always keep an eye on her. The reason she chose music to be her career is that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> feel safe. She was also interested in skateboarding, and accepted the invitation to join a nu-metal band covering Linkin Park’s songs. She then quickly became a well-recognized and respected rapper from the Vietnamese underground scene.|$|E
50|$|Purrazzo started {{training}} at the now defunct D2W Pro Wrestling Academy in December 2012 after she spotted an advertisement for <b>it.</b> She <b>made</b> <b>her</b> in-ring debut in 2013.|$|R
6000|$|So much Milly {{had said}} to <b>her,</b> and <b>it</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a trifle rash. [...] "Oh you'll never get a stiff note from him in your life." ...|$|R

25|$|But {{she found}} immense success in 1938 with The Yearling, {{a story about}} a Florida boy and his pet deer and his {{relationship}} with his father, which she originally intended as a story for young readers. It was selected for the Book-of-the-Month Club, and it won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1939. MGM purchased the rights to the film version, which was released in 1946, and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> famous. In 1942, Rawlings published Cross Creek, an autobiographical account of her relationships with her neighbors and her beloved Florida hammocks. Again it was chosen by the Book-of-the-Month Club, and it was even released in a special armed forces edition, sent to servicemen during World War II.|$|E
25|$|She {{became the}} triple jump {{champion}} at the 1995 Summer Universiade. She won her first major medals soon after, taking the silver at the 1996 European Indoor Athletics Championships and winning her first Olympic medal for the Czech Republic with a bronze in the triple {{jump at the}} 1996 Summer Olympics. She confirmed her ability in the 1997 season, first winning a bronze at the 1997 IAAF World Indoor Championships, and then winning the World Championships with a national record jump of 15.20m – {{this was the best}} jump that season and <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> the second best athlete in the event after Inessa Kravets at the time. A silver medal at the 1997 IAAF Grand Prix Final brought an end to a successful season.|$|E
500|$|The {{episode is}} a {{favorite}} of Anderson's, who said she [...] "loved the script" [...] and that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> cry. Series creator Chris Carter received angry calls after the Heaven's Gate, a UFO religion cult, committed mass suicide less than six months after the episode had aired. He declined to comment.|$|E
60|$|Sally {{turned her}} face away, for Agatha had, as <b>it</b> happened, <b>made</b> <b>her</b> meaning {{perfectly}} plain. Somewhat to the latter's astonishment, she {{showed no sign of}} resentment when she looked round again.|$|R
6000|$|I now {{perceived}} {{still more}} {{how she had}} been beating about the bush and how weary at last <b>it</b> had <b>made</b> <b>her.</b> [...] "Your letter won't have got there. Your letter never went." ...|$|R
5000|$|Just Four More Left: What-a-Mess {{turns to}} the Buyer's Bargain Network to get a Birthday gift for His Mom. Though when Felicia found out about <b>it,</b> <b>it</b> quickly <b>made</b> <b>her</b> into a shopaholic.|$|R
500|$|In {{her book}} My Life as a 10-Year-Old Boy, Cartwright {{comments}} {{that she was}} a fan of Borgnine's performance in Marty. She writes that the film had [...] "changed [...] forever", and that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> [...] "realize that actors have the power through their work to inspire and enlighten others." [...] She recalls that when Borgnine arrived for the recording session, she [...] "lost all coolness" [...] and ran up to him and exclaimed [...] "ohmygod, Marty!" ...|$|E
500|$|Following her father's death, Donna adopted her half-niece Mia. Discussing the {{development}} {{in the context of}} her 2010 Casualty appearance, Jacobs explained that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> ED shift particularly stressful as [...] "she now has little Mia to look after – if anything happens to Donna, Mia is completely on her own." [...] She expanded that, [...] "The stakes have really moved on for Donna {{over the last couple of}} years. She's had to accept some responsibility and it's not now just about which man she's going to sleep with next".|$|E
500|$|Brownlee and {{his wife}} had two sons: John Edy Brownlee was born December 1915, and Alan Marshall Brownlee was born September 1917. [...] Florence's {{pregnancy}} with Alan, combined with a bout of poor health before <b>it,</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a virtual invalid in subsequent years. [...] This was exacerbated by the 1919 birth and death in infancy of a daughter. [...] Also in 1919, Brownlee visited his family in Ontario; he returned to Alberta with his sister, Maude, who assisted Florence with the care of her children. [...] Soon after, a full-time maid was hired.|$|E
60|$|Mary {{wore the}} long black hood that effectually {{concealed}} <b>her</b> face. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> of <b>her</b> a woman, a Mormon woman, and strangely belied the lithe {{form and the}} braid of gold hair.|$|R
60|$|There was, {{he remembered}} with amazing vividness, a little hollow {{he had found}} under her ear, and how when he kissed <b>her</b> there <b>it</b> always <b>made</b> <b>her</b> forget her worries and ethical {{problems}} for a time and turn to him....|$|R
6000|$|Fanny Assingham {{took it in}} deeper--for what <b>it</b> {{immediately}} <b>made</b> <b>her</b> {{give out}} louder. [...] "HE'S splendid then." [...] She sounded it almost aggressively; it was what she was reduced to--she had positively to place it.|$|R
500|$|The cast found {{working with}} the eye patches strange as they had to act with one eye; Kingston remarked that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> [...] "slightly dizzy". Gillan was allowed to fire a specially-made machine gun used for films. Churchill's Roman Buckingham Palace was filmed in the Cardiff's City Council building. The script called for an Indiana Jones style tunnel for the Headless Monks' chamber, but as that kind of {{location}} was not available in Cardiff a set was built instead. The skulls were hand-crafted and required a lot of preparation, so {{it was one of}} the first things started for the episode's production.|$|E
500|$|Claire Hale Underwood is {{originally}} from the exclusive Highland Park enclave of Dallas, Texas. Her late {{father was a}} major Texas Republican. While at Radcliffe College in Cambridge, she met Francis J. Underwood, a Harvard Law student from South Carolina. She is from a wealthy family, and the show characterizes her as a [...] "Dallas Debutante" [...] and [...] "Lily White". [...] She recounts her father's taking her to Dealey Plaza, where John F. Kennedy was assassinated, and that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> feel “so sad, so angry". She has a difficult relationship with her mother, Elizabeth Hale (Ellen Burstyn), who despises Frank and is disappointed in Claire for marrying him.|$|E
500|$|Jordan Sargent of Pitchfork Media praised its {{composition}} {{and noted that}} the disco and gospel genres are where middle-aged woman can [...] "thrive", whereby Carey [...] "fits in unsurprisingly well". He was, however, critical {{of the decision to}} include Wale on the song. Similarly, Aisha Harris of Slate Magazine praised the song's production and Carey's vocals too, but also thought that Wale's rap verses were not required. Conversely, fashion designer Donatella Versace, a friend of Carey's, told Vogue that she thought Carey's singing and Wale's rapping complimented each other on the song, describing it as [...] "poetry", and that <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> want to get up and dance [...] "all summer".|$|E
60|$|She {{looked up}} at him full of pain, then {{continued}} slowly to stroke her lips against a ruffled flower. Their scent, as she smelled it, was so much kinder than he; <b>it</b> almost <b>made</b> <b>her</b> cry.|$|R
50|$|This film {{earned her}} a {{spot at the}} Tribeca Film Festival and the Hot Docs Film Festival. <b>It</b> also <b>made</b> <b>her</b> a Finalist for the Cinema Eye honors in 2016 in the non-fiction film for {{television}} category.|$|R
5000|$|She - with admirable zeal - <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>her</b> {{mission to}} visit {{all those who}} were sick and orphaned. She <b>made</b> <b>it</b> <b>her</b> {{business}} to console them {{and to help them}} with their lives while showing them the love of Christ. She also worked with the poor and said of them: [...] "the poor are our masters".|$|R
500|$|Manning {{said the}} {{incident}} that had affected her the most was when 15 detainees had been arrested by the Iraqi Federal Police for printing anti-Iraqi literature. She {{was asked by the}} Army to find out who the [...] "bad guys" [...] were, and discovered that the detainees had followed what Manning said was a corruption trail within the Iraqi cabinet. She reported this to her commanding officer, but said [...] "he didn't want to hear any of it"; she said the officer told her to help the Iraqi police find more detainees. Manning said <b>it</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> realize, [...] "i was actively involved in something that i was completely against..." ...|$|E
500|$|Als calls Angelou {{one of the}} [...] "pioneers of self-exposure", {{willing to}} focus {{honestly}} on the more negative aspects of her personality and choices. For example, while Angelou was composing her second autobiography, Gather Together in My Name, she was concerned about how her readers would react to her disclosure {{that she had been}} a prostitute. Her husband Paul Du Feu talked her into publishing the book by encouraging her to [...] "tell the truth as a writer" [...] and [...] "be honest about it". Through the writing of her life stories, however, Angelou has become recognized and highly respected as a spokesperson for Blacks and women. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>her,</b> as scholar Joanne Braxton stated, [...] "without a doubt...America's most visible black woman autobiographer".|$|E
500|$|McFarland praised Kaitlin Olson's {{portrayal}} of Brenda, however, stating [...] "Olson got some laughs out {{of just how}} deep Brenda’s denial went, finding every possible excuse to blame herself and exonerate Jeff. <b>It</b> <b>made</b> <b>her</b> endearing and easily likeable, every bit the opposite from Olson's place in the rogue’s gallery of misanthropy on It's Always Sunny in Philadelphia." [...] He ended his review by comparing it to the fellow FOX animation series The Simpsons, noting, [...] "The Simpsons managed {{to find the right}} blend with Sideshow Bob episodes, or in the aching sadness of Homer and Marge's marriage, but as has been said ad infinitum, Family Guy hasn't mastered that combination {{in the same way as}} the original." [...] He graded the episode as C+.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, <b>it</b> has <b>made</b> <b>her</b> very happy," [...] said Joscelyn gravely. [...] "And <b>it</b> has <b>made</b> me happy, too. I love Aunty Nan, Mrs. Morrison, and I owe her much. In {{all my life}} I {{have never}} met a woman so purely, unselfishly good and noble and true." ...|$|R
50|$|On 25 January 2012, Marsh {{appeared}} on Channel 5's Bullied: My Secret Past. She {{spoke of the}} effect bullying had on her and how <b>it</b> has <b>made</b> <b>her</b> who she is today. She also met other victims of bullying.|$|R
50|$|She resumed her career, but {{was unable}} to sustain <b>it</b> and <b>made</b> <b>her</b> final acting {{appearance}} in 1963. She died of cirrhosis of the liver and was cremated at Golders Green Crematorium, North London. The Rank Organisation paid for her funeral.|$|R
