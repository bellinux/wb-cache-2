Marge also adds the shooting {{must have been an}} accident, considering Maggie, being an infant, is very unlikely to know how to operate a gun. In the final shot, Maggie is shown with shifty eyes, suggesting that she may have shot Mr. Burns deliberately.|$|E
5|$|On Thursday, April 7, 2011, {{instead of}} {{pleading}} guilty, {{as had been}} expected based on the previous statements, the Garridos {{pleaded not guilty to}} charges of kidnapping and raping Dugard, as well as other charges, in an amended Grand Jury indictment. Phillip's attorney, public defender Susan Gellman, alleged that the grand jury might have been selected improperly and might have acted improperly. Gellman did not elaborate on her claim in the courtroom, but said outside that she had questions about the racial and geographic makeup of the grand jury that originally indicted the Garridos in September 2010. Judge Phimister noted that there were issues about the process itself before the grand jury, and also stated that the court would consider whether the grand jury acted appropriately. These developments were largely unforeseen by attorney Stephen Tapson, who represented Nancy; Tapson had said earlier that week that Phillip had made a deal with prosecutors to plead guilty and {{spend the rest of his}} life in prison. Gellman was upset with Tapson for telling reporters that her client had planned to plead guilty, saying that he should only speak about his own client, Nancy. Tapson said he found out about Gellman's plans only late on April 6. Neither attorney would elaborate further on the specific concerns about the grand jury. El Dorado, California District Attorney Vern Pierson said he did not think the complaints about the grand <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> ultimately derail the case against the Garridos.|$|E
25|$|On February 27, 2017, O'Neill {{ruled that}} he would allow a jury from outside the county but the trial would remain in Montgomery County; he also ruled the <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> be sequestered.|$|E

That is, if a community was 10% Latino and 90% Anglo, {{it is probable that}} approximately 80% of 12 member <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> include at least one Latino member, while only 40% of 6 member <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> consist of any Latinos.|$|R

60|$|I {{certainly}} think that <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> be more conscientious, {{if they were}} allowed a larger discretion. But, after all, juries cannot {{be better than the}} mass out of which they are taken.

25|$|Worried that Cagle and McCoy's confessions {{might be}} ruled {{inadmissible}} and afraid that a <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> be sympathetic towards men who murdered a Communist, U.S. attorney J.

25|$|In late November 2004, {{outgoing}} Albany County District Attorney Paul Clyne {{convened a}} grand jury to hear testimony implicating Christopher Porco in the murder. Those who {{were reported to have}} testified in the closed-session hearing included Porco's friends from college, a university campus safety officer, and a former girlfriend. The grand <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> field more testimony before handing up an indictment against Christopher in November 2005, one year after the attacks.|$|E
25|$|Those {{witnesses}} and other witnesses from the Forensic Science Service told the Court of Appeal {{that this was}} not the right conclusion to draw from the discovery of the particle of FDR. It was instead no more likely that the particle had come from a gun fired by Barry George than that it had come from some other source. The Court of Appeal concluded that, if this evidence had been given to the jury at the trial, there was no certainty that the <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> have found George guilty. For this reason his conviction had to be quashed.|$|E
5000|$|During World War II the Administration of Justice (Emergency Provisions) (Scotland) Act 1939 {{provided}} that both {{civil and criminal}} <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> have seven members, of whom two would be special members, except for trials for treason or murder, or where a case in the High Court of Justiciary required the regular jury of fifteen on the [...] "gravity of matters in issue".|$|R

6000|$|With a view, possibly, to {{promoting}} respect for law {{by making the}} statutes so conform to public sentiment that none will fall into disesteem and disuse, it has been advocated {{that there be a}} formal recognition of sex in the penal code, by making a difference in the punishment of men and of women for the same crimes and misdemeanors. The argument is that if women were [...] "provided" [...] with milder punishment <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> sometimes convict them, whereas they now commonly get off altogether.|$|R
25|$|At the prosecution's request, {{the judge}} issued {{a gag order}} forbidding the {{following}} parties {{to talk to the}} news media: the defendant, the prosecutor, defense counsel, any attorney working in their offices, their agents, staff, experts, any judicial officer or court employee, any law enforcement employee, and any agency involved in the case or any persons subpoenaed or expected to testify. The purpose was to prevent people among whom a <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> be selected from being influenced. However, the judge would consider proposals to allow either side to answer reporters' questions about rumors surrounding the case.|$|E
25|$|On either argument, the {{defendant}} {{would have been}} entitled to an acquittal; however, the court considered it doubtful whether Bailey had laid sufficient basis for his defence to be considered by the jury at all. If so, the <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> have been entitled to reject it. On {{the facts of the}} case, particularly Bailey's setting out armed with an iron bar, his apparent normality shortly after the incident, and the doctor's evidence as to the unlikelihood of such an episode of automatism in the circumstances, the court considered that there had been no miscarriage of justice. Bailey's appeal was dismissed.|$|E
25|$|Originally, the {{broadcaster}} {{had planned}} a national final format titled Kto? to select their entry. On 1 September 2013, RTR opened the submission period for artists and composers {{to submit their}} applications for the selection. Between September and October 2013, it was planned that a special <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> shortlist the applicants to 25 finalists for a televised show on 31 December 2013. However, in December 2013, RTR announced that the selection would be postponed until March 2014 and that the application deadline would be extended until 28 February 2014. Plans for the national final were later abandoned by the broadcaster.|$|E
25|$|Fearing that <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> find it {{impossible}} to discount an implicating confession against a codefendant who stood alongside the confessor, the Court discounted such instructions. In a subsequent case, Parker, the Court was split on the same issue where each defendant had made his own confession. Writing in concurrence, Justice Blackmun argued that introduction of a codefendant's own interlocking confession could cause a harmless violation of the Confrontation Clause (he found such an example in that case), but {{that there were other}} foreseeable cases in which it could lead to a more harmful violation.|$|R
50|$|Snake {{handling}} {{is legal}} {{in the state}} of West Virginia, as the current state constitution does not allow any law to impede upon nor promote a religious practice. Snake handling was made a felony punishable by death under Georgia law in 1941, following the death of a seven-year-old of a rattlesnake bite. However, the punishment was so severe that <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> refuse to convict, and the law was repealed in 1968. The American Civil Liberties Union has defended the religious freedom of snake handlers against various attempts to have the practice banned.|$|R

25|$|In April 2012, it was {{reported}} that Friedkin was suing Universal and Paramount over the domestic rights of Sorcerer for a share of the movie's profits. In a July 2012 interview, Friedkin said that the film's case was pending at the Ninth District Court of Appeals in California with a settlement to be announced by November 26. Had no settlement been reached by that time, the <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> have to set a trial date for March 2013. The director emphasized that his intent is not dictated by profits but by the desire to have it released on DVD and Blu-ray, as well as having a film print for various outlets, such as film societies and universities. He also highlighted that if this case becomes precedential, he wishes it would help other pictures in a similar situation.|$|E
25|$|Riggins was {{evaluated}} and found competent to stand trial, {{with one of}} the three evaluating psychiatrists dissenting. Riggins stated he planned to present an insanity defense and requested that the Mellaril be discontinued until after the trial so that the <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> see his mental state first hand rather than be given a false impression induced by the medication, which would deny him due process. The court heard testimony from three psychiatrists with differing opinions and then gave a one-page decision denying Riggins' request but giving no rationale for the denial. Riggins testified on his own behalf during the trial, claiming that Wade was trying to kill him and that voices in his head told him that killing Wade was justified as self-defense. The jury found Riggins guilty of murder and robbery with a deadly weapon, and sentenced him to death.|$|E
25|$|Exxon {{recovered}} {{a significant portion}} of clean-up and legal expenses through insurance claims associated with the grounding of the Exxon Valdez. Also, in 1991, Exxon made a quiet, separate financial settlement of damages with a group of seafood producers known as the Seattle Seven for the disaster's effect on the Alaskan seafood industry. The agreement granted $63.75million to the Seattle Seven, but stipulated that the seafood companies would have to repay almost all of any punitive damages awarded in other civil proceedings. The $5billion in punitive damages was awarded later, and the Seattle Seven's share could have been as high as $750million if the damages award had held. Other plaintiffs have objected to this secret arrangement, and when it came to light, Judge Holland ruled that Exxon should have told the jury at the start that an agreement had already been made, so the <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> know exactly how much Exxon would have to pay.|$|E
50|$|Interested in {{improving}} the material situation of the peasantry, Comșa worked to establish an agricultural council for Szeben County in 1888, and served as president from 1893 to 1905. In the 1890s and 1900s, aided by his former student Victor Tordășianu, he organized some two dozen exhibitions of calves in the county's settlements, also exhibiting sheep and fruits; <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> award prizes to the winners. Every year, he helped organize workshops and lectures {{in which he would}} introduce modern techniques to the peasants. He set up credit institutions that allowed them to purchase equipment, or else lent these at modest prices.|$|R

25|$|But on October 30, 2009, Justice Kornreich {{declined}} {{to approve a}} renew and re-argue of her July29 decision holding that SNG could change its club rules, but {{she said that the}} decision only dealt with Rules 49–54, and that everything else about rules changes was dicta (meaning that it was just discussion—not essential to the decision about Rules 49–54 and can not be used as precedent). Further, the court ordered the nomination of a panel of three independent experts who had sat on an America's Cup jury in the past in order to resolve certain outstanding issues. On the basis of the unanimous opinion of those three experts, on November19, 2009, judge Kornreich ruled that: (1) all ballast, whether moveable or not, must be included when measuring the Load Water Line; (2) it would be safe to hold the race in Valencia in February, (3) the Notice of Race and other rules could be issued as little as 16 days before the race, but the matter is moot because SNG had already published the Notice of Race; that Notice of Race could be modified by SNG but any modifications could be challenged by GGYC and would be reviewed by the jury; (4) the question of when the panel of jurors is customarily appointed is moot because the <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> soon be named; (5) the arrangements between ISAF and SNG regarding appointment of the jury appeared acceptable.|$|E

500|$|Capital {{punishment}} {{was a major}} issue that was debated in the state during Brigg's tenure, with social reformers calling for its abolition. [...] Briggs personally favored capital punishment, but for political reasons called for moderation in its use, seeking, for example, to limit its application in murder cases to those involving first degree murder. [...] After an acquittal in an 1846 murder case where anti-death penalty sentiment was thought to have a role, Briggs, seeking to undercut the anti-death penalty lobby, proposed eliminating the penalty for all crimes except murder, but expressed concern that more such acquittals by sympathetic <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> undermine the connection between crime and punishment.|$|R

This was the third and last time Luxembourg finished the evening {{at the foot of the}} scoreboard, and their only nul-points result. Winter's blank was the last zero prior to the introduction of the current 12 points voting system in 1975, and the next song to be totally shunned by all national <b>juries</b> <b>would</b> not come along until 1978.|$|R

[...] Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, during a discussion about terrorism, torture and the law, took offense at a Canadian judge's remark that Canada, [...] "thankfully", did not consider what Jack Bauer would do when setting policy. He reportedly responded with a defense of Bauer, arguing that law enforcement officials deserve latitude in times of great crisis, and that no <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> convict Bauer in those types of situations.|$|E
500|$|U.S. Attorney Campbell {{presented}} {{the case to}} the grand jury personally. Glasser, Kretske, Alfred E. Roth, Anthony Horton, and Louis Kaplan were indicted in the United States District Court for the Northern District of Illinois on two counts of a bribery conspiracy on September 29, 1939. Glasser and Kretske were former Assistant U.S. Attorneys; Roth was a defense attorney representing the bribe payors in the majority of the cases alleged to be fixed; and Horton and Kaplan were [...] "go-betweens" [...] for the bribes. Horton was an African-American bail bondsman; Kaplan was a purveyor of untaxed liquor. The allegations were that the prosecutors either agreed to recommend the dismissal of charges or ensured that the grand <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> not return an indictment. The maximum authorized sentence under the charges was two years imprisonment and a $10,000 fine. All five made bail of $1,500 each.|$|E
500|$|On 19 December 1769, Junius wrote {{a letter}} attacking the King, and incensed at this, the {{government}} ordered several people to be arrested and tried for seditious libel, including Woodfall for publishing the letters, John Almon for selling them, and John Miller for republishing them. Almon's case was heard at Westminster Hall by Mansfield and a jury on 2 June 1770. He was found guilty, although it is unclear in what fashion he was punished, if at all. [...] Woodfall was tried on 13 June 1770, by Mansfield and a jury. While Mansfield believed that the language used was libellous, the jury disagreed, and held that he was [...] "guilty of printing and publishing only", and innocent of seditious libel. Miller was tried on 13 July 1770, and after six hours of discussion, the jury found him innocent. As {{a result of these}} two trials, it became clear that no <b>jury</b> <b>would</b> convict a printer for printing these letters, leaving Junius free to continue publishing them.|$|E
