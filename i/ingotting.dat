50|$|In 1982, a diver {{discovered}} a shipwreck off {{the shore of}} Uluburun, Turkey. The ship contained 317 copper <b>ingots</b> in the normal oxhide shape, 36 with only two corner protrusions, 121 shaped like buns, and five shaped like pillows. The oxhide <b>ingots</b> (<b>ingots</b> with two or four protrusions) range in weight from 20.1 to 29.5 kg after being cleaned of their corrosion. These <b>ingots</b> were found stacked in four rows following a herringbone pattern. The smooth sides of the <b>ingots</b> faced downwards, and the lowest layer rested on brushwood. There are three whole tin oxhide <b>ingots,</b> {{and there are many}} tin <b>ingots</b> cut into quarters or halves, with their corner protrusion(s) still intact. Besides metal <b>ingots,</b> the cargo included ivory, metal jewelry, and Mycenaean, Cypriot, and Canaanite pottery. Tree-ring dating of firewood from the ship gives an approximate date of 1300 BC. More than 160 copper oxhide <b>ingots,</b> 62 bun <b>ingots,</b> and some of the tin oxhide <b>ingots</b> have incised marks typically on their rough sides. Some of these marks—resembling fish, oars, and boats—relate to the sea, and they were probably incised after casting, when the <b>ingot</b> was received or exported.|$|R
5000|$|It is {{uncertain}} whether the oxhide <b>ingots</b> {{served as a}} form of currency. <b>Ingots</b> found in excavations at Mycenae are now part of the exhibits of the Numismatic Museum of Athens. Cemal Pulak argues that the weights of the Uluburun <b>ingots</b> are similar enough to have allowed “a rough but quick reckoning of a given quantity of raw metal prior to weighing.” But George Bass proposes, via the Gelidonya <b>ingots,</b> whose weights are approximately the same if somewhat lower than the Uluburun <b>ingot</b> weights, that the weights were not standard and thus the <b>ingots</b> were not a currency. Another theory is that the oxhide shape, as well as the bun shape that some <b>ingots</b> took, was a visual statement that the <b>ingot</b> at hand is part of a legitimate trade. In Sardinia, oxhide <b>ingot</b> fragments have been found in hoards with bun <b>ingots</b> and scrap metal and, in some cases, in a metallurgical workshop. Citing this evidence, Vasiliki Kassianidou argues that the oxhide <b>ingots</b> “were meant to be used rather than to be kept as prestige goods.” ...|$|R

As-cast microstructures and homogenization behaviors of LFEC and DC <b>ingots</b> were investigated experimentally.

The remnant constituents of LFEC <b>ingot</b> were less in content and smaller in size than that of DC <b>ingot</b> after homogenization at 480 ℃ for various lengths of time. Similar to the dissolving of constituents, the LFEC <b>ingot</b> exhibited faster diffusion kinetics of alloying elements from grain boundary to inner.

40|$|ABSTRACT: In {{order to}} further reduce {{the costs of}} multi-crystalline <b>ingots</b> this work aims at {{increasing}} the <b>ingot</b> growth velocities well above the typical values of 1. 5 cm/h or less [1], that are found in most industrial multi-crystalline Silicon <b>ingot</b> growth processes. A reduced cycle time {{for the growth of}} multi-c Silicon <b>ingots</b> directly transfers to reduced direct costs of this important production step in the PV value chain. The impact of the growth velocity on the crystalline quality has been investigated. The objective is to obtain similar solar cell efficiencies on multi-crystalline wafer from <b>ingots</b> grown at higher velocities compared to the standard conditions. Solar cells from <b>ingots</b> crystallized at 1 cm/h and 2 cm/h have been processed and characterized. An additional <b>ingot</b> has been crystallized at an even higher growth velocity of 3 cm/h but the macroscopic crystal structures were not satisfying and indicated already a low quality of the <b>ingot,</b> so no solar cells were processed from this high velocity <b>ingot.</b> ...|$|R

40|$|Underwater {{excavations}} of a Late Bronze Age shipwreck at Uluburun, Turkey {{recovered a}} combined 475 oxhide and plano-convex discoid copper <b>ingots.</b> While the hoard of <b>ingots</b> excavated at Uluburun brings {{the total number}} of copper <b>ingots</b> from the Late Bronze Age to over 1000, interestingly, only one <b>ingot</b> mold from the that period has been identified. Scholars have speculated over the means behind the creation of these <b>ingots</b> for decades, but with a relative absence of archaeological molds the most promising method of reaching any conclusions as to the types of molds used in antiquity seems to be experimentation. Experimental archaeology, has, in recent years been responsible for many breakthroughs in how the past is viewed. In the face of an overwhelming disparity of copper <b>ingot</b> molds from the Late Bronze Age, trials designed around testing different mold materials and casting techniques have the potential to determine, with relative certainty, how copper <b>ingots</b> were cast over 3000 years ago. This thesis examines the possible materials used to create copper <b>ingot</b> molds through a study of their prevalence in antiquity and also details experiments in which these materials were used, in concert with different casting techniques, to create copper <b>ingots.</b> The results of these experiments are combined with analyses of the Uluburun <b>ingots</b> in an effort to bring some closure to the debate surrounding copper <b>ingot</b> molds in the Late Bronze Age...|$|R

40|$|Shrinkage {{porosity}} defect {{is often}} found in an air cooled jumbo steel <b>ingot,</b> which will influence {{the quality of the}} final rolled plates. In practical production, some rolled plates are frequently rejected due to the serious shrinkage porosity of the <b>ingot.</b> To improve the quality of the <b>ingot,</b> a new cooling method, gradient cooling process (in which {{the upper part of the}} <b>ingot</b> is air cooled and the lower part is spray cooled) was put forward in this study. The solidification behaviors for a 60 t jumbo slab <b>ingot</b> under gradient cooling condition were simulated using the ProCast software, and the results were compared with those of an <b>ingot</b> by air cooling condition. The solidifying tendency, temperature field and distribution of shrinkage porosities in the <b>ingot</b> under different cooling conditions were analyzed. Simulation results show that under gradient cooling condition the solidification of the slab <b>ingot</b> progresses in an upward manner along the vertical z axis and in a centripetal manner along the horizontal x and y axes. Gradient cooling can efficiently reduce shrinkage porosity of the jumbo slab <b>ingot</b> by optimizing the solidification sequence, and making the position of shrinkage porosity move from near the middle height of the <b>ingot</b> (under air cooling condition) towards the head of the ingot; and the secondary shrinkage is eliminated. In addition, the solidification time of the <b>ingot</b> under gradient cooling is 7. 3 h in this simulation, which is 2. 7 h faster than that under air cooling. A 60 t jumbo slab <b>ingot</b> was successfully produced under gradient cooling condition.
