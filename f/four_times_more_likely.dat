5|$|Both {{environmental}} factors and genetics {{are associated with}} alcoholism with about half the risk attributed to each. A person with a parent or sibling with alcoholism is three to <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to be alcoholic themselves. Environmental factors include social, cultural, and behavioral influences. High stress levels, anxiety, as well as inexpensive easily accessible alcohol increases risk. People may continue to drink partly to prevent or improve symptoms of withdrawal. A low level of withdrawal may last for months following stopping. Medically, alcoholism is considered both a physical and mental illness. Both questionnaires and certain blood tests may detect people with possible alcoholism. Further information is then collected to confirm the diagnosis.|$|E

25|$|William Parker, Randy Bollinger, {{and colleagues}} at Duke University {{proposed}} in 2007 that the appendix serves as a haven for useful bacteria when illness flushes those bacteria {{from the rest of}} the intestines. This proposal is based on an understanding that emerged by the early 2000s of how the immune system supports the growth of beneficial intestinal bacteria, in combination with many well-known features of the appendix, including its architecture, its location just below the normal one-way flow of food and germs in the large intestine, and its association with copious amounts of immune tissue. Research performed at Winthrop–University Hospital showed that individuals without an appendix were <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to have a recurrence of Clostridium difficile colitis. The appendix, therefore, may act as a safe house for good bacteria. This reservoir of bacteria could then serve to repopulate the gut flora in the digestive system following a bout of dysentery or cholera, or boost it following a milder gastrointestinal illness.|$|E
25|$|Girls {{are most}} likely to enjoy high {{self-esteem}} when engaged in supportive relationships with friends, the most important function of friendship to them is having someone who can provide social and moral support. When they fail to win friends' approval or couldn't find someone with whom to share common activities and common interests, in these cases, girls suffer from low self-esteem. In contrast, boys are more concerned with establishing and asserting their independence and defining their relation to authority. As such, {{they are more likely to}} derive high self-esteem from their ability to successfully influence their friends; on the other hand, the lack of romantic competence, for example, failure to win or maintain the affection of the opposite or same-sex (depending on sexual orientation), is the major contributor to low self-esteem in adolescent boys. Due to the fact that both men and women happen to have a low self-esteem after ending a romantic relationship, they are prone to other symptoms that is caused by this state. Depression and hopelessness are only two of the various symptoms and it is said that women are twice as likely to experience depression and men are three to <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to commit suicide (Mearns, 1991; Ustun & Sartorius, 1995).|$|E

25|$|While the genders {{engage in}} IPV at about equal rates, females {{are more likely}} to use less {{dangerous}} forms of physical violence (e.g. pushing, pinching, slapping, scratching or kicking), while males {{are more likely to}} punch, strangle, beat, burn, or threaten with weapons. Males {{are also more likely to}} use sexual aggression, although both genders are equally likely to pressure their partner into sexual activities. In addition, females are <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to respond as having experienced rape and are more likely to suffer fatal injuries inflicted by their partner, or to need psychological help as a result of the abuse. Females are more likely to consider IPV a serious problem than are their male counterparts, who are more likely to disregard female-perpetrated IPV. Along with form, motivations for violence also vary by gender: females are likely to perpetrate violence in self-defense, while males are likely to perpetrate violence to exert power or control. The self-defense aspect is supported by findings that previous victimization is a stronger predictor of perpetration in females than in males. Other research indicates that boys who have been abused in childhood by a family member are more prone to IPV perpetration, while girls who have been abused in childhood by a family member are prone to lack empathy and self-efficacy; but the risks for the likelihood of IPV perpetration and victimization among adolescents vary and are not well understood.|$|E
500|$|Irons {{proposed}} that costly signalling theory could explain costly religious behaviour. He argued that hard-to-fake religious displays enhanced trust and solidarity in a community, producing emotional and economic benefits. He showed that display signals among the Yomut Turkmen of northern Iran helped to secure trade agreements. These [...] "ostentatious" [...] displays signalled commitment to Islam to strangers and group members.

However, confounding variables may not have been excluded. Wood found that religion offers a subjective feeling of well-being within a community, where costly signalling protects against free riders and helps to build self-control among committed members. Iannaccone studied the effects of costly signals on religious communities. In a self-reported survey, as the strictness of a church increased, the attendance and contributions to that church increased proportionally. In effect, people were more willing to participate in a church that has more stringent demands on its members. Despite this observation, costly donations and acts conducted in a religious context does not itself establish that membership in these clubs is actually worth the entry costs imposed.|$|E

Studies of female patients with IBS show symptom severity often fluctuates with the menstrual cycle, suggesting hormonal differences may play a role. Endorsement of gender-related traits has been associated with quality of life and psychological adjustment in IBS. [...] Gender differences in healthcare-seeking may also play a role. Gender differences in trait anxiety may contribute to lower pain thresholds in women, putting them at greater risk for a number of chronic pain disorders. Finally, sexual trauma is a major risk factor for IBS, with as many as 33% of those affected reporting such abuse. Because women are at higher risk of sexual abuse than men, sex-related risk of abuse may contribute to the higher rate of IBS in women.|$|R

2500|$|A 2001 World Health Organization (WHO) {{report found}} that infant formula {{prepared}} in accordance with applicable Codex Alimentarius standards was a safe complementary food and a suitable breast milk substitute. In 2003, the WHO and UNICEF published their Global Strategy for Infant and Young Child Feeding, which restated that [...] "processed-food products for...young children should, when sold or otherwise distributed, meet applicable standards recommended by the Codex Alimentarius Commission", and also warned that [...] "lack of breastfeeding—and especially lack of exclusive breastfeeding during the first half-year of life—are important risk factors for infant and childhood morbidity and mortality". In particular, the use of infant formula in less economically developed countries is linked to poorer health outcomes because of the prevalence of unsanitary preparation conditions, including lack of clean water and lack of sanitizing equipment. UNICEF estimates that a formula-fed child living in unclean conditions is between 6 and 25 {{times more likely to}} die of diarrhea and <b>four</b> <b>times</b> <b>more</b> <b>likely</b> to die of pneumonia than a breastfed child.

40|$|This study {{examined}} whether children’s inferential styles moderate {{the association between}} the onset of depressive symptoms in children and their parents. To provide a powerful test of our hypotheses, we utilized a high-risk sample (parents {{with a history of}} major depressive episodes and their children) and a multiwave longitudinal de-sign. During the initial assessment, 140 children (ages 6 to 14) completed measures assessing depressogenic inferential styles. Parents and children also completed mea-sures assessing current level of depressive symptoms. Following the initial assess-ment, children and parents were contacted every 6 weeks for the next year to complete measures assessing depressive symptoms. The results of hierarchical linear modeling analyses indicated that children who exhibited depressogenic inferential styles re-ported greater elevations in depressive symptoms following elevations in their par-ent’s level of depressive symptoms than did children who did not exhibit such styles. The strength of this association was greater in girls. There is a wide consensus in the psychological lit-erature that depression runs in families (Goodman & Gotlib, 2002; Hammen, 1991).

Traditionally, assessment of drug use in heart failure {{has focused on the}} use of individual agents irrespective of CHF severity. This study investigates drug use for CHF patients in general practice with respect to the available evidence, incorporating both disease severity and the use of combination drug realines. Methods and results: A cross-sectional survey of 769 Dutch CHF patients was performed as part of IMPROVEMENT of HF study. For each New York Heart Association severity classification the minimum treatment appropriate for the heart failure severity according to the scientific evidence available {{at the time of the}} study (1999) was defined.
