5|$|At {{the same}} time that Salk was testing his vaccine, both Albert Sabin and Hilary Koprowski {{continued}} working on developing a vaccine using live virus. During a meeting in Stockholm to discuss polio vaccines in November 1955, Sabin presented results obtained on a group of 80 volunteers, while Koprowski read a paper detailing the findings of a trial enrolling 150 people. Sabin and Koprowski both eventually succeeded in developing vaccines. Because of the commitment to the Salk vaccine in America, Sabin and Koprowski both did their testing outside of the United States, Sabin in Mexico and then in the Soviet Union, and Koprowski in the Congo and Poland. In 1957, Sabin developed a trivalent vaccine, containing attenuated strains of all three types of poliovirus. In 1959, ten million children in the Soviet Union received the Sabin oral vaccine. For this work, Sabin was given the medal of the Order of Friendship Among Peoples, described as the Soviets' highest civilian honor, despite having become an American during the <b>height</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> war. Sabin's oral vaccine using live virus came into commercial use in 1961.

40|$|The {{tropical}} tropopause layer (TTL) is a transition region between the troposphere and the strato-sphere. In this study <b>the</b> vertical extent <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TTL is diagnosed from radiosonde and ozonesonde profiles {{in the tropics}} and a climatology of this layer is presented. The radiative balance in the TTL is also characterized. The TTL is locally defined as extending from <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lapse rate minimum at 10 – 12 km to <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> point tropopause (CPT) at 16 – 17 km. The minimum in lapse rate represents <b>the</b> level <b>of</b> maximum convective impact on upper tropospheric temperatures, which is found to closely correspond to a minimum in ozone. Variations in this level are correlated with convective activity as measured by satellite brightness temperatures and Outgoing Longwave Radiation (OLR). At <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> point, <b>the</b> TTL height is nearly uniform throughout the tropics, and has a pronounced annual cycle. There are regional variations in <b>the</b> altitude <b>of</b> <b>the</b> lower boundary <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TTL. Interannual variations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TTL result from changes in the large scale organization of convective activity, such as from the El-Niño Southern Oscillation (ENSO).

To better understand vertical transport in the TTL, the clear sky radiative heating rate is diagnosed using a sophisticated radiative transfer scheme. <b>The</b> level <b>of</b> zero radiative heating occurs roughly 1 km below the CPT, implying that convection needs to loft air 4 – 5 km above <b>the</b> base <b>of</b> <b>the</b> TTL if the air is to eventually enter the stratosphere. 1...|$|R
40|$|Lead isotope {{compositions}} of aerosols {{from two}} Geneva stations (city and country), monitored during one year, show <b>the</b> existence <b>of</b> two main lead sources, petrol and waste incineration. A third, subordinate source {{is represented by}} coal burning and is detectable in winter. This source {{is believed to be}} of local importance due to the very low coal consumption in Geneva. Lead contributions from the three sources have been apportioned using isotopic mixing equations. During summer, petrol contributes about 70 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total lead in the city while the incinerator contributes 65 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total lead in the country. During winter, coal burning provides in average 15 % <b>of</b> <b>the</b> total lead in the city. Atmospheric lead concentrations are mainly controlled by wind speed. As expected, wind dilution is more effective on lead aerosols originating from sources situated farthest from the monitoring stations. Thus, incinerator lead contributions at the city station decrease linearly with wind speed in winter due to their transport from a longer distance than automotive emissions. Due to the same process, during summer petrol contributions are anticorrelated with wind speed at the country. Incinerator winter contributions in the city display greater variations than in summer, suggesting a seasonal meteorological regime which enhances the wind speed control on incinerator aerosol dilution. We relate this meteorological regime to the lower mixing <b>height</b> typical <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>cold</b> season.

40|$|We have {{performed}} time-dependent numerical simulations <b>of</b> <b>the</b> interstellar medium (ISM) {{which account for}} galactic shear and magnetic fields, vertical gravity, and a radiative cooling function for atomic gas. This allows us to study the magnetorotational instability (MRI) in cloudy, vertically stratified disks.

There is significant thermally unstable gas, but the density and temperature distributions retain <b>the</b> twin peaks <b>of</b> <b>the</b> classical two-phase ISM.

40|$|The radio {{occultation}} technique {{has been used}} to characterize planetary atmospheres since the 1960 's spanning atmospheric pressures from 16 microbars to several bars. In 1988, <b>the</b> use <b>of</b> GPS signals to make occultation observations of Earth's atmosphere was realized by Tom Yunck and Gunnar Lindal at JPL. In the GPS to low-Earth-orbiter limb- viewing occultation geometry, Fresnel diffraction yield a unique combination of high vertical resolution of 100 m to 1 km at long wavelengths (approx. 20 cm) insensitive to particulate scattering which allows routine limb sounding from the lower mesosphere through the troposphere. A single orbiting GPS/GLONASS receiver can observe - 1000 to 1400 daily occultations providing as many daily, high vertical resolution soundings as the present global radiosonde network, but with far more evenly distributed, global coverage. The occultations yield profiles of refractivity as a function <b>of</b> <b>height.</b> In <b>the</b> <b>cold,</b> dry conditions <b>of</b> <b>the</b> upper troposphere and above (T less than 240 K), profiles of density, pressure (geopotential), and temperature can be derived. Given additional temperature information, water vapor can be derived in the midddle and lower troposphere with a unique combination of vertical resolution, global distribution and insensitivity to clouds and precipitation to an accuracy of approx. 0. 2 g/kg. At low latitudes, moisture profiles will be accurate to 1 - 5 % within the convective boundary layer and better than 20 % below 6 to 7 km. Accuracies of climatological averages should be approx. 0. 1 g/kg limited by the biases in the temperature estimates. To use refractivity to constrain water vapor, knowledge of temperature is required. The simplest approach is to use the temperature field from an analysis such as the 6 hour ECMWF global analysis interpolated to <b>the</b> locations <b>of</b> each occultation. A better approach is to combine the temperature and moisture fields from such an analysis with the occultation refractivity in a weighting scheme based on the errors in each data field. A ID variational combinational approach has been developed at the UKMO. We win present results from both approaches from GPS/MET data taken in June and July 1995 and compare them with the ECMWF global 6 hour moisture analyses which are derived largely from TOVS and radiosonde data. Overall, the atmosphere below the 500 mb level appears somewhat drier in general than the ECNIWF humidity field.
