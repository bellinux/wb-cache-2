40|$|The {{early stage}} of radical {{innovation}} is characterised by uncertainty, data overload and often high rates of change. Schumpeter’s ‘creative destruction’ view of innovation is now exacerbated by ‘hypercompetition’ (D'Aveni, 1999), a theory that describers the increasing rate and intensity of change in modern markets. In the design and strategy literature, design thinking is often positioned as an appropriate mediator of radical innovation in these circumstances, by facilitating interpretation of market uncertainties and moderating organisational behaviours. At its inception radical innovation is determined largely by the cognitive behaviour of the actors involved, often semi-consciously. In this study {{we set out to}} distinguish design thinking from analytical thinking and investigate the suitability of both for the effective early stage formation of radical innovation concepts. Additionally, whereas design thinking literature mostly investigates and reports on the benefits of its application, we seek to understand where design thinking’s limitations lie and where it may be better replaced by other forms of cognition. This paper reports at an interim stage of a continuing study. It provides a comprehensive review of relevant literature and a qualitative exploration of two successful <b>innovating</b> <b>SME</b> firms. A framework is given for a novel experimental protocol that will be used in the next stage of the larger study...|$|E

40|$|Innovation {{support for}} SMEs is {{considered}} {{from the point}} of view of the "needs" of SMEs in the context of a specific regional economy – London's Lee Valley region. As identified in the literature and, more specifically, in a survey of 100 <b>innovating</b> <b>SMEs</b> in the study region, attention is focused on the innovation support needs that relate to the size characteristics of SMEs. The difficulties of financing innovation are shown to stem from the attitudes of SME owner managers as well as from supply-side failures. The paper examines four different innovation support instruments, taken as constituting key elements of the support "system" within the region. Drawing on the findings of interviews with client businesses, the paper considers the strengths and weaknesses of each policy instrument. Conclusions relate to the overall impact of innovation support provision, in particular the need for greater integration in the design and implementation of policy instruments...|$|R

This paper presents the results of a survey among 605 Dutch <b>innovating</b> <b>SMEs.</b> The results show that SMEs are increasingly adapting open innovation practices. Moreover, they indicate a difference in the adaption to open innovation between manufacturing and services firms, and between larger and smaller SMEs. Larger SMEs adapting more quickly and in a more structured and professionalized way to open innovation than smaller ones. The survey furthermore shows that SMEs generally pursue an open innovation strategy to realize market-related objectives such as meeting customer demands, or keeping up with competitors. In addition, the results show that the most important barriers respondents face are related to the organizational and cultural differences when cooperating with other partners. Other serious barriers are administrative burdens, financing and knowledge transfer problems. ...|$|R

Nevertheless, as this article will illustrate, market failure for <b>innovating</b> <b>SMEs</b> needs to be carefully identified, to better target government policies. And even if policy is well targeted, there could still be failures in implementation, as the evidence from actual policies being implemented in the EU and elsewhere suggest. In order to support policy making for stimulating innovation at SMEs, this article first reviews the empirical evidence on the contribution of SMEs to innovation, examining whether the barriers to innovation are related to market failures and whether SMEs are affected more by market failure induced barriers. We also take a look at trends in actual SME innovation policies in Member States and at EU level and how they have been evaluated on effectiveness. A concluding section channels the insights from this evidence into suggestions for improving policies towards SMEs and Innovation.

40|$|SMEs often {{experience}} difficulties accessing {{financing to}} support their activities in general, and their R&D and innovation activities in particular. Lenders tend to be risk adverse vis-à-vis SMEs because of their diversity and the assessment difficulties this entails. Establishing the risk levels of innovation activities can be quite complex {{and there is no}} formalized tool to help financial analysts assess them and implement compensation and financing terms that will satisfy both lenders and entrepreneurs. This situation creates {{a lot of pressure on}} the cash resources of <b>innovating</b> <b>SMEs.</b> The appropriation and application of more effective risk assessment methods represent an excellent solution to SMEs’ financing problems. This could allow SMEs to manage more strategically the various components of risk. Institutions assisting SMEs in their projects could more effectively develop programs and services closely linked to the essential mitigation and coverage measures. Lenders and investors could more precisely assess the real risks involved in funding SME projects, allowing them to offer more attractive financing terms.

40|$|International audienceGeographical {{clusters}} are nowadays {{considered as}} a relevant factor for competitiveness, thanks to their innovative capabilities. In this context, public policies based on this approach are flourishing all over the world. The French “Pole of competitiveness” (PoC) policy (Politique des pôles de compétitivité) {{is one of these}} initiatives. It is the new French industrial policy aiming at reinforcing the specializations of the economy and the attractiveness of territories by fostering the development of R&D projects, bringing together multinationals, universities, and particularly Small-Middle-Sized-Enterprises (SMEs). Precisely, significant research suggests that in order to <b>innovate</b> <b>SMEs</b> need to cooperate and they are also vital for the functioning, and survival of innovative milieux. Consequently, their integration is a key issue for French PoC' success. However, the call for projects shows that despite their efforts, French Poles of Competitiveness are not totally successful: a gap remains especially between the massive financial investments helping <b>SMEs</b> <b>innovate</b> and the expected results. Yet, this issue is only analysed by focusing on intrinsic weaknesses of SMEs' management or on the complexities of existing support programmes supporting SMEs' innovation. This is insufficient. Innovation dynamics are different from a cluster to another and many failures of innovation policies come from the lack of identification of these specificities. Therefore, this paper aims are threefold: it aims at introducing the French PoC, indeed, the French PoC policy is the main new policy gathering all the nation's innovation programmes. But few papers are explaining how they work. It aims at identifying the territorial innovation dynamics within PoC and how they work, and then combine this analysis with the intrinsic features of SMEs management, to better understand how they get involved in these dynamics. It finally aims at presenting the preliminary results of the first stage of research: the analysis of a specific French PoC, the “Secured Communicating Solutions”(SCS) PoC as well as the further research questions they raise for the next stage of research...|$|R
40|$|Faced {{with the}} {{technological}} changes {{and with the}} rise of international competition, the competitiveness of firms is based more and more on innovation. In this context, the new innovating firms are regarded as source of competitive dynamism. However, these firms encounter difficulties to finance their activities; it is thus widely acknowledged {{that there is a need}} for public support towards these <b>innovating</b> <b>SMEs.</b> In this context, the French government launched in 1999 a National Competition for creation of New Technology-based Firms, which rewards some innovating projects in giving them a financial and managerial support to start and develop their activity. Ten years after the creation of the competition, we propose to evaluate its economic effects: How did the Competition winners grow and survive? We thus analyse the characteristics of the firms that have won the competition and focus our study on the factors of survival of these firms. To undertake our analysis, we use a database from the French ministry of research, composed of the prize-winning firms. This database is merged with the DIANE database, which gives financial information on firms. Our analysis is then based on three categories of indicators to characterise the survival rate and the factors of survival of new firms. We distinguish indicators related to the firms itself, the entrepreneur, and the environment of the firm. Our results show that the firms that won the contest have a higher survival rate than other firms. We also show that the indicators to explain the survival rate are similar to the one found in the literature.

40|$|Collaboration in {{innovation}} {{is considered an}} effective strategy to overcome barriers to <b>innovate</b> in <b>SMEs.</b> However, resource constraints and risk of knowledge leakage force management in SMEs to be selective with whom and where to collaborate. Still {{little is known about}} interactions between types of partners and their geographical location. This paper sheds new light on the relation between functional and geographical diversity in innovation partners and new-to-the-market and new-to-the-firm innovation performance in SMEs. Using data from two waves (2008 and 2010) of the Community Innovation Survey (CIS) for Belgium, a positive relation is found between market partners and innovation new-to-the-firm, and between science and global partners and innovation new-to-the-market. A larger diversity in type and in geographical spread of partners is found to be positively associated with innovation new-to-the-market. Cooperation with a diverse set of market partners enhances new to the firm innovation. More diversity in science partners enhances the balance between new to the firm and new to the market innovation. Diversity among international partners enhances new to the firm and new to the market innovation, but not the balance between both. A cooperation strategy balancing functional with geographical partner diversity enhances the balance between new to the firm versus new to the market innovation. status: publishe...|$|R

40|$|Technological advancements, {{especially}} in Information and Communication Technologies (ICT) have enhanced greatly the competition {{spurred by the}} globalization of the world economies. Even {{small and medium-sized enterprises}} (SMEs) are no more immune to the challenges that the globalization brings about. It is a remarkable, and in certain instances worrisome, situation since SMEs play a key-role in most economies, in that they constitute the largest business block and provide the bulk of employment. However, opportunities presented by the globalization and the entwined, simultaneous pressure to <b>innovate</b> opens for <b>SMEs</b> new arenas to engage in what we may call are global innovation activities so as to gain, retain, and further strengthen the competitive position. This pressure to go for global innovation is enhanced by given socio-demographic factors, e. g. shortage of skilled labour, in many industrialized countries.

40|$|The {{literature}} on ‘open’ innovation {{emphasizes the need}} to engage in external knowledge relations in order to <b>innovate.</b> Particularly for <b>SMEs,</b> research cooperation and R&D outsourcing can offer possibilities to complement the often limited internal research resources. However, they also bring in their wake requirements in terms of absorptive capacity and managerial skills of the internal R&D personnel. The paper focuses on the different requirements in terms of availability and training of research managers and R&D experts for research cooperation versus R&D outsourcing in SMEs. An empirical analysis of micro-level data provided by the OECD business R&D survey for Belgium reveals that the relation between R&D personnel requirements and research collaboration and R&D outsourcing depends upon the SME’s size. Therefore, to study this subject appropriately a distinction between very small, small, and medium-sized firms is relevant. Very small firms engage significantly less in research cooperation than medium-sized firms and the propensity to engage in research cooperation is positively associated with the share of PhD holders among the research managers and R&D experts. For R&D outsourcing a lower involvement is noted in medium-sized firms, and the propensity to outsource increases with the formal qualification level of the R&D personnel and with R&D training. Among the SMEs, small firms are most engaged in research cooperation and in R&D outsourcing. In the case of research cooperation they rely on highly qualified experts. For R&D outsourcing activities both the presence of research managers and R&D experts is important. status: publishe...|$|R
40|$|This {{comparative}} study explored {{the process by}} which <b>SMEs</b> <b>innovate</b> in embedded and arm’s length relationships. In particular, this research asked how the nature of problem-solving, knowledge creation, innovation drivers and innovation outcomes differ in arm’s length and embedded (collaborative) ties. Contemporary strategy research recommends organizations manage close collaborative relationships to innovate and achieve a competitive advantage; however these relationships are resource intensive, prone to failure and often fail to provide an adequate return on investment. By investigating the under-researched innovative potential of low maintenance arm’s length relationships this research aimed to inform more sustainable SME innovation strategy, as these organizations are especially vulnerable to the perils of close collaboration. This thesis followed a qualitative research design utilizing a mono-method strategy of enquiry and conducted 21 semi-structured interviews with senior engineers, designers, MDs and management level staff across 10 north east-based manufacturing SMEs. The main findings based on thematic analysis of the data highlight that knowledge creation occurs via externalization, combination and internalization modes in arm’s length ties, whilst embedded ties also facilitate socialization knowledge creation. Incremental process innovation was most typically associated with collaborative relationships which often tended to be driven by isomorphic pressures, these pressures also manifest during initial problem-solving activity. In contrast, arm’s length ties were associated with both radical and incremental product innovation and the identification of new markets; this activity was exploratory in nature and primarily explained via organizational learning theory. These findings provide an alternative solution to addressing the challenges of networked SME innovation and help orientate future research into more sustainable innovation strategy...|$|R
40|$|The {{linear model}} of {{innovation}} has been superseded {{by a variety}} of theoretical models that view the innovation process as systemic, complex, multi-level, multi-temporal, involving a plurality of heterogeneous economic agents. Accordingly, the emphasis of the policy discourse has changed over time. The focus has shifted from the direct public funding of basic research as an engine of innovation, to the creation of markets for knowledge goods, to, eventually, the acknowledgement that knowledge transfer very often requires direct interactions among innovating actors. In most cases, policy interventions attempt to facilitate the match between “demand” and “supply” of the knowledge needed to innovate. A complexity perspective calls for a different framing, one focused on the fostering of processes characterized by multiple agency levels, multiple temporal scales, ontological uncertainty and emergent outcomes. This contribution explores what it means to design interventions in support of innovation processes inspired by a complex systems perspective. It does so by analyzing two examples of coordinated interventions: a public policy funding <b>innovating</b> networks (with <b>SMEs,</b> research centers and university), and a private initiative, promoted by a network of medium-sized mechanical engineering firms, that supports innovation by means of technology brokerage. Relying on two unique datasets recording the interactions of the organizations involved in these interventions, social network analysis and qualitative research are combined in order to investigate network dynamics and the roles of specific actors in fostering innovation processes. Then, some general implications for the design of coordinated interventions supporting innovation in a complexity perspective are drawn...|$|R
40|$|Thesis (MBA) [...] Stellenbosch University, 2014. Small {{and medium}} {{enterprises}} (SMEs) {{are an important}} and growing sector in all economies (Chang & Powell, 1998 : 264). SMEs {{play a significant role}} in Swaziland‘s economy. TechnoServe assisted a number of start-up and existing SMEs to develop their business plans, thus improving the structure of these SMEs. Although there is limited information available, the trend has been for SMEs in Swaziland to continue to be mediocre performers, and some even resort to shutting down their businesses, thus affecting the economy of the country. TechnoServe is evaluating the performance of the small businesses that have participated in their programmes. The organisation would like to know whether the businesses were changing when there was a need for change. It would also like to know the type of business model innovation (radical or incremental) pursued by the SMEs that have participated in their programme, and further to determine whether there is a relationship between the changes in the business model and the performance of the businesses, which signals the growth of the SMEs. In this study, revenue is the measure of the performance of the business. For this study, the SMEs that have participated in the TechnoServe business planning competition were interviewed. During the interview, information was obtained on the changes that the SMEs had effected in each of the nine business elements that were used in the study. Scores were allocated and ultimately it was determined whether the SME had performed no innovation, incremental innovation or radical innovation. The increase in revenue, which signalled the growth of the SME, was also determined and statistical tools were used to determine the relationship between business model innovation and the growth of SMEs in Swaziland. The concept of business model innovation in the context of SMEs in Swaziland seems strange and determining whether <b>SMEs</b> in Swaziland <b>innovate</b> their business models seems new. Upon completing the interviews with the SMEs, it was discovered that five <b>SMEs</b> had not <b>innovated</b> their business models, eight SMEs had performed incremental innovation and two <b>SMEs</b> had <b>innovated</b> their business models radically. It is worth mentioning that those SMEs that were deemed to have not innovated their business models, had, however, innovated two of the nine elements that were used to determine whether <b>SMEs</b> had <b>innovated</b> their business models. It was discovered that innovating the value proposition and/or the channel increases the chances of SMEs increasing their customer base, in turn increasing their revenue streams. The innovation of the channel was another form of innovation that resulted in the SME that had performed it increasing shareholder value. The <b>SME</b> that had <b>innovated</b> the channel was able to sell the same product to other customer segments as well and not just to its existing segment, thus increasing market share and ultimately shareholder value. Innovating the channel has also resulted in other elements of the business model to be innovated as well. The introduction of a new channel resulted in the SME serving an additional customer segment and the cost structure changed. From this study, it was also discovered that there are links between the business model elements. Innovating one element caused the <b>SMEs</b> to <b>innovate</b> other business model elements. Innovation in the value proposition element of the business model resulted in a number of other elements being innovated as well. The reason why most of the <b>SMEs</b> <b>innovated</b> other elements was that they had innovated the value proposition. This created other opportunities for them, which is understandable given the systemic nature of business. The results of the 15 SMEs indicated that the <b>SMEs</b> that had <b>innovated</b> their business models experienced growth in revenue, which, in this study, is the indicator for the growth of the SMEs. The <b>SMEs</b> that did <b>innovate</b> their business models also experienced an increase in revenue, although this increase was smaller compared to the increase experienced by those <b>SMEs</b> that had <b>innovated</b> their business models. This means that revenue grows even if a business model is not <b>innovated.</b> These <b>SMEs</b> however, were found to have innovated certain elements of their business models incrementally. The change in the net profit for these SMEs was also considered. From the interviews, it was clear that 80 per cent of the SMEs that were considered to have not innovated their business models had experienced no changes in net profit. The rest of the SMEs interviewed, which were mostly SMEs that were considered to have innovated their business models, experienced an increase in net profit. This means that their increase in revenue was at a higher rate compared to the costs incurred by the businesses. Furthermore, regression analysis was done and the correlation coefficient (multiple R) is equal to 0. 81, which is close to one. This means that 81 per cent of the variation in revenue changes is explained by the independent variable, which is business model innovation...|$|R
40|$|The {{views on}} ‘distributed’ or ‘open’ {{innovation}} emphasize {{the use of}} external knowledge in order to <b>innovate.</b> Particularly for <b>SMEs,</b> research cooperation and R&D outsourcing can offer possibilities to complement the often limited internal research resources. However, external knowledge relations potentially bring in their wake a loss of technology assets. This paper focuses on research cooperation and R&D outsourcing in SMEs. Two functions of research cooperation are envisaged: generating new knowledge and exchanging existing knowledge previously developed within the firm. The paper addresses two items that are underdeveloped in the current literature. First, {{attention is paid to}} the heterogeneity in terms of firm size of SMEs. A distinction is made between micro, small-sized, and medium-sized firms. Second, consideration is given to the formal management of R&D activities. This is related to the management of the potential risks inherently involved in external knowledge relations. It is measured by the presence of a formal R&D manager within the SME. A descriptive quantitative empirical analysis is presented based on firm-level data provided by the OECD business R&D survey for Belgium covering the period 2004 - 2005. The starting point is a representative sample of 140 (quasi-) permanent R&D active SMEs. The analysis reveals marked differences in R&D outsourcing behaviour according {{to the size of the}} SME. In this respect, medium-sized firms are found to be significantly less involved in R&D outsourcing (one out of four firms) compared to micro and small-sized firms (one out of two firms is engaged in R&D outsourcing). On average, two-thirds of the (quasi-) permanent R&D active firms have a formal R&D manager and there are no marked differences according to firm size. The presence of an R&D manager turns out to be significantly associated with the firm’s engagement in R&D outsourcing and with knowledge exchange in research cooperation. There is no interaction effect between the presence of an R&D manager and firm size to explain firm engagement in research cooperation and R&D outsourcing. status: publishe...|$|R
