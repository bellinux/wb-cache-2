25|$|After the war, a {{vigorous}} debate among the civilian elites spawned {{the development of}} two new political parties. Silver mining entrepreneurs, who had {{become the most important}} <b>economic</b> <b>group</b> in the country, created the Conservative Party (Partido Conservador) led by Mariano Baptista, a vocal opponent of the War of the Pacific. Conservatives favored reaching a quick peace settlement with Chile that would include a financial indemnity for the lost territories and enable Bolivia to construct a railroad for continued mining exports. The Liberal Party (Partido Liberal) was founded in 1883 by the former chief of staff, General Eliodoro Camacho and was more hawkish, as it denounced the pacifism of the Conservatives and any peace treaty with Chile. Liberals also resented the dependence of the mining industry on Chilean and British capital and hoped to attract United States investments.|$|E
500|$|Once in the legislature, however, Greenfield faltered in his {{leadership}} of his caucus. [...] The UFA MLAs {{came from a}} determinedly independent and non-partisan background and proved nearly impossible to whip. [...] When Greenfield selected his cabinet {{and was about to}} announce it to his caucus for their vetting, he was interrupted by Lorne Proudfoot who asked whether, in addition to the rumoured inclusion of Labour members, the cabinet would include any of the fourteen Liberal MLAs. [...] Proudfoot argued that to exclude them would be to [...] "start out much after the matter of the old parties". [...] Greenfield had not intended this, and suggested that no Liberals would likely be amenable to it. [...] Irene Parlby, the caucus's only woman (who Greenfield would shortly name as Alberta's first female cabinet minister) agreed, and suggested that the UFA's ideal of securing representation for all economic groups in society did not apply to the Liberals, who were not an <b>economic</b> <b>group</b> and were not democratically organized in any event. [...] Proudfoot's proposal was defeated sixteen votes to fourteen. [...] Greenfield went on to name the seven member cabinet he had intended, including Labour MLA Alex Ross as Minister of Public Works, Parlby as Minister Without Portfolio, and Greenfield himself as Provincial Treasurer.|$|E
2500|$|Prestige – In {{the article}} [...] "Status Consumption in Consumer Behaviour: Scale Development and Validation" [...] (1999), J.K. Eastman et al. said that status {{consumption}} {{is based upon}} conspicuous consumption; yet, the literature of contemporary marketing does not establish definitive meanings for the terms status consumption and conspicuous consumption. Moreover, in the article [...] "Status Brands: Examining the Effects of Non-product-related Brand Associations on Status and Conspicuous Consumption" [...] (2002), A. O'Cass and H. Frost said that sociologists often incorrectly used the terms [...] "status consumption" [...] and [...] "conspicuous consumption" [...] as interchangeable and equivalent terms. In a later study, O'Cass and Frost determined that, as sociologic constructs, the terms [...] "status consumption" [...] and [...] "conspicuous consumption" [...] denote different sociologic behaviours. About the ambiguities of denotation and connotation of the term [...] "conspicuous consumption", in the article [...] "Conspicuous Consumption: A Literature Review" [...] (1984), R. Mason reported that the classical, general theories of consumer decision-processes do not readily accommodate the construct of [...] "conspicuous consumption", because the nature of said socio-economic behaviours varies according to the social class and the <b>economic</b> <b>group</b> studied.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe aim of {{this paper}} is to {{investigate}} whether the dynamic integration across a large set of developed and emerging Islamic stock markets allows potential diversification benefits in tranquil and turmoil periods. Using the multivariate cointegration test, we find the presence of long-run equilibrium relationship among Islamic stock markets of similar <b>economic</b> <b>grouping.</b> While, Islamic stock markets from different <b>economic</b> <b>grouping</b> are partially segmented. Empirical results of estimated Vector Error Correction Model provide a lowest level of short run integration among the <b>economic</b> <b>grouping</b> of European-Asian emerging markets, MENA-Latin American and European-Latin American Islamic stock markets. In addition, the level of integration and causality relations among Islamic stock markets tends to change over time, mainly during periods characterized by financial crises. Overall, our results suggest that Shariah compliant stocks could offer potential diversification benefits by considering different <b>economic</b> <b>grouping</b> such as that in developed and emerging countries...|$|R

2500|$|Unlike other Yoruba {{cities with}} {{traditional}} kingship institutions however, In Ibadan, the warrior class became {{the rulers of}} the city as well as the most important <b>economic</b> <b>group.</b> [...] According to HRH Sir Isaac Babalola Akinyele, the late Olubadan (king) of Ibadan (Olu Ibadan means 'Lord of Ibadan'), in his authoritative book on the history of Ibadan, Iwe Itan Ibadan (1911), the first city was destroyed due to an incident at an Egungun (masquerade) festival when an Egungun was accidentally disrobed and derisively mocked by women and children in an open marketplace full of people. The then Alaafin of Oyo had ordered the old city destroyed for the act. [...] Lagelu was by now an old, frail man; he could not stop the destruction of his city, but he and some of his people survived the attack and fled to a nearby hill for sanctuary. On the hill they survived by eating oro fruit and snails; later, they cultivated the land and made corn and millets into pap meals known as oori or eko, which they ate with roasted snails. They improvised a bit by using the snail shells to drink the liquefied eko. Ultimately, Lagelu and his people came down from the hill and founded another city, called Eba'dan.|$|E

30|$|The joining of <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> {{constitutes}} another innovative transversal strategy {{adopted by}} women where the members put their efforts together {{in order to}} enhance entrepreneurship development. Women entrepreneurs who are working jointly in <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> guarantee themselves to acquire loans from microfinance institutions, by using the group as guarantor. In other words, in case that one of the group members default, the rest of the members can assume responsibilities for the left member’s share. Therefore, this strategy of working in <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> is a panacea to socio-cultural constraints of getting finance for business development and finally support family well-being (e.g., paying school fees for their children, etc.). Furthermore, it enable, women entrepreneurs to tackle other challenges, for instance, food processing technology, packaging materials, access to resources, unequal economic power, inequality in education hence results into enhancing women power to participate in decision making in the household and higher organs. Therefore, working in <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> in an innovative strategy of developing women entrepreneurship by eliminating challenges embedded in socio-cultural perspective and create a conducive environment for doing business as their counterpart male entrepreneurs.|$|R

40|$|In {{modern day}} Chile the {{economic}} entrepreneurial landscape {{is made up}} of large multinational conglomerates, local <b>economic</b> <b>groups,</b> and so-called emerging <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> (that burgeoned with the transformation of former government employees into owners of important parts of state-owned companies). This last group is mainly comprised of the neoliberal technocracy that designed the economic policy of the Pinochet dictator-ship. The power of these emerging technical groups in democratic Chile is based not only on direct private property, but also on their participation as high-ranking officials that dominate strategic decision-making in companies and conglomerates. Their power has been consolidated with the so-called second wave of privatizations (1985 – 90), as they took advantage of both profound neoliberal convictions and the unconditional support for multinational companies, which technocratic officials consider to be the materialization of the globalization of the Chilean economy. In turn, many of these technocrats operate as agents or strategic executives, associating with local <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> and transnational conglomerates. The analysis of the origin and formation of the <b>economic</b> <b>groups</b> and conglomerates that today dominate the globalized Chilean economy is the main objective of this article...|$|R
