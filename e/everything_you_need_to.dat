25|$|Less than a {{month after}} the Korean War {{armistice}} (a cessation of hostilities), Miller wound up in a drunk tank in North Georgia Mountains. Miller stated later that this incident was the lowest point of his life. Upon his release, Miller enlisted in the Marines. During his three years in the United States Marine Corps, Miller attained the rank of sergeant. He often refers to the value of his experience in the Marine Corps in his writing and stump speeches; in his book on the subject, entitled Corps Values: <b>Everything</b> <b>You</b> <b>Need</b> <b>to</b> Know I Learned in the Marines, he wrote: In the twelve weeks of hell and transformation that were Marine Corps boot camp, I learned the values of achieving a successful life that have guided and sustained me on the course which, although sometimes checkered and detoured, I have followed ever since.|$|E

She would find her next job at the Los Angeles Parks and Recreation Department. Her new job was teaching art for a summer program in the city's public parks. At that time Boyle Heights, Los Angeles had the most Mexican-Americans and the highest number of gangs in the country. Members of different gangs loitered in the parks she worked at, and she noticed the graffiti and knew they were territorial markings.

500|$|Foster {{signed for}} League Two side Rotherham United on 20 June 2011. He signed a one-year {{contract}} with the club, with an option of a second year. Foster made his debut for the club in a 3–0 home victory against Gillingham on 27 August 2011, coming on as an 84th-minute substitute with Rotherham already holding a three-goal advantage. After making no further first-team appearances the following month, Foster was made available for loan by manager Andy Scott. Scott stated Foster lacked both desire and fitness since signing for the club — [...] "If {{you want to be}} match fit, you get yourself match fit. You can work in training, you can stay behind, you have days off, you can get yourself fit. Luke has not been in the side and that tells you <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know". However, no loan move materialised, and Foster made his second appearance for Rotherham in a 3–3 away draw at Morecambe on 25 October 2011. He appeared as a 27th-minute substitute in the club's following match four days later, a 1–1 draw against Northampton Town, and subsequently made his first start in a 2–0 home victory over Aldershot Town on 5 November — Rotherham's first win in 10 matches. In December 2011, Rotherham manager Andy Scott revealed that Foster would miss the rest of the 2011–12 season {{as a result of a}} cruciate ligament damage sustained in a match against Hereford United on 10 December 2011. He was released by Rotherham in May 2012, having made six appearances for the club.|$|E
500|$|Time {{magazine}} writer James Poniewozik {{said the}} episode continued {{the development of}} the town of Pawnee, which he said was like a character itself and compared it to The Simpsons Springfield. Poniewozik said [...] "Media Blitz" [...] also showed how well integrated Scott has become with the cast, and called the [...] "Crazy Ira and The Douche" [...] interview [...] "maybe the most perfect scene P has put together yet". Likewise, Steve Heisler of The A.V. Club called Ben's interview with Perd Hapley [...] "one of the best scenes Parks & Rec has ever done". Heisler enjoyed how the series gradually built up Ben Wyatt's backstory throughout the season, [...] "then took it way over-the-top". However, he expressed disappointment that the Ann and Chris subplot ended with no resolution. Zap2it writer Rick Porter, called the episode a [...] "great showcase for Scott's deadpan gifts" [...] and wrote, [...] "This show hasn't had a real miss yet this season." [...] Porter said the April and Andy subplot was less interesting, but he enjoyed the scenes between Ron and Andy. Steve Kandell of New York magazine praised the episode for bringing Scott's character to the forefront, as well as for providing satire on small-town politics without coming across as preachy. Kandell said of the April and Andy story, [...] "If their kiss at the shoeshine stand, as expected and inevitable as it may have been, didn't make your heart soar just a little bit, then you're dead inside and probably just turned on NBC for Outsourced a few minutes early." [...] Joel Keller of TV Squad complimented Scott, calling him a [...] "current-generation Bob Newhart" [...] and [...] "one of those actors who can just give someone a look and it conveys <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> know about what his character is thinking". Keller said he also enjoyed seeing April and Andy reconcile, but felt the Crazy Ira and The Douche scene was ineffective because, regarding morning zoo radio shows, [...] "it's hard to parody something that's already a parody of itself".|$|E

500|$|Cliff Fletcher, who drafted {{him into}} the NHL, {{described}} Nieuwendyk as being a [...] "pre-eminent two-way guy who had 50-goal seasons", adding that [...] "{{he had a great}} stick around the net, he had a great shot, he saw the ice well, he could skate, he had the size – he had <b>everything</b> <b>you</b> <b>needed</b> <b>to</b> have. History has indicated that wherever he went, the team was competitive. The more that was on the line in big games, the better Joe played." [...] He was an offensive centre in Calgary and power play specialist, able to withstand the physical punishment required {{to stand in front of}} the net and battle defencemen for the puck. He led the NHL in power play goals in 1987–88 with 31 and finished in the top ten on four other occasions. [...] Wayne Gretzky, who also played box lacrosse in his youth, argued that the skills Nieuwendyk learned dodging opposing players in that sport aided his development as a hockey player. Nieuwendyk was regarded as a top faceoff man, a skill that Team Canada relied on during the Olympics. He was a checking-line centre at the 2002 Olympics, relied on for his defensive and faceoff abilities.|$|R
