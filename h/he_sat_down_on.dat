500|$|At around 9:30 on {{the night}} of September 27, 1868, Hindman was assassinated by one or more unknown assailants who fired through his parlor window while he was reading his {{newspaper}} with his children. The musket shots hit Hindman in the jaw, throat, and hands, and he died eight hours later due to significant blood loss. Before his death, Hindman gave a farewell speech to his neighbors and political supporters from the porch of his house. With [...] "perfect composure", Hindman told listeners to [...] "unite their courage and determination to bring peace to the people". Hindman hinted at the recent political debate with Powell Clayton as a possible motivation for the shooting and said, [...] "I do not know who killed me; but I can say, whoever it was, I forgive him." [...] He asked James H. O'Connor, the husband of Mollie's stepmother, to [...] "take care of my family and be a protector to my wife and dear little ones". After O'Connor accepted, Hindman stated, [...] "I forgive everybody, and hope they will forgive me." [...] Afterwards, he was too weak to continue speaking, and <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a lounge. He remained there until he died early next morning. The assassination was announced in all major newspapers throughout the state. William Woodruff of the Gazette said Hindman died as an [...] "able and distinguished man" [...] whose [...] "short but splendid career" [...] {{had a profound impact on}} Arkansan state politics.|$|E
2500|$|David Bowie, {{a fan of}} the band, then {{offered them}} a song he had just written. As Hunter {{recalled}} in a 2004 DVD interview, [...] "He offered us [...] "Suffragette City", which I didn't think was good enough. And then <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the floor, Regent Street it was, in a publisher's office, and plays 'All The Young Dudes' on an acoustic guitar." [...] It reached No. 3 in the UK Singles Chart, and revived the band, who were appreciative of Bowie's rescue. Guitarist Ralphs relates that Bowie taught Mott studio tricks, but one of the best-known sounds during the period was a 'hand-clap-in-the-toilet' routine that relied more on Hunter's vision than it did on Bowie's clearly more experienced studio abilities. Bowie guitarist Mick Ronson also significantly contributed to Mott's sound, a fact noticed by Hunter, who would later collaborate with Ronson a great deal.|$|E
2500|$|On October 15, 2008, Wallenda {{performed}} on a live broadcast of Today. The {{plan was to}} walk and then bicycle off {{the roof of the}} Prudential Center in Downtown Newark, New Jersey, across a suspended high-wire 13 and 1/2 stories (135feet) above the ground. Starting at 8:30am, he first walked across the [...] cable with a [...] balancing pole. Halfway through, <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the wire and called the Today show hosts. [...] "Where are you?" [...] he asked, joking that he was expecting to carry one of the show's hosts across the wire on his shoulder. Sitting down on the wire is easy, he said, it is getting back up that is tricky. A few steps before completing the walk, Wallenda stopped and waved to the crowd. When he resumed, he wobbled and had to bend his knees to regain balance. [...] "I actually slipped," [...] he said later. [...] "I lost focus there for a moment" [...] because of some unexpected tape on the wire. He completed the walk in about five minutes.|$|E

60|$|Five minutes arterwards {{the door}} opened and Henery Walker came {{staggering}} in. He was as white as a sheet, his 'at was knocked on one side of his 'ead, and there was two or three nasty-looking scratches on 'is cheek. He came straight to Bill Chambers's mug--wot 'ad just been filled--and emptied it, and then <b>'e</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a seat gasping for breath.|$|R
60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> him <b>down</b> <b>on</b> a {{chair and}} gaped upon me, while I could not contain myself from laughing.|$|R

60|$|Evidently Roberts, {{the night}} watchman! The editor felt relieved; {{here was a}} clue to some explanation. <b>He</b> {{instantly}} <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the floor between them.|$|R

60|$|<b>He</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the edge}} of the mattress, and for all reply went on {{laughing}} in the same frightful and improbable tone.|$|E

60|$|When {{he got to}} {{the brook}} there was nothing in sight, so <b>he</b> <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the bank to watch, and again fell fast asleep.|$|E
6000|$|<b>He</b> then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> {{the rock}} {{and looked into the}} water. [...] "We can go home and get a long pair of tongs, and get it with them at any rate," [...] said he.|$|R
60|$|In {{each of the}} arm-chairs, reposing {{across the}} arms, was a violin-case. <b>He</b> had <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> the edge of one {{seat in front of}} the sacred fiddle. Helena had come quickly and removed the violin.|$|R
60|$|The {{first thing}} Mat {{did when he}} got to his lodgings, was to fill and light his pipe. <b>He</b> then <b>sat</b> <b>down</b> <b>on</b> his bear-skins, and dragged the box close to him which he had brought from Dibbledean.|$|R
