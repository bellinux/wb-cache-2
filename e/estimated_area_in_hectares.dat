With the increase of the data available from web, some remote sensing techniques allows the generation of altimetric maps, without fieldwork. However, {{it is important that}} the representations must be consistent with the field reality. In this way, the goal of this paper aims evaluate the slope representation from SRTM (Shuttle Radar Topographic Mission), using slope representation from GNSS-RTK (Global Navigation Sattelite System Real Time Kinematic) as reference, in a regular rural property (about 100 heactares). The both data were converted to shapefile and inserted in a GIS software (ArcGIS 9. 3) to establish: input the points, points interpolation by Kriging, create an one meter contour, generate a TIN grid and extract the slope percentage. The preview results of this work showed some similarities from SRTM data with the field reality in a visual context, but in an absolute numbers analysis (<b>areas</b> <b>in</b> <b>hectares)</b> was verified significant differences. Therefore concludes that SRTM data is good tool to evaluate the land cover aptitude and to locate soil types.

40|$|South Africa is {{well known}} for its {{semi-arid}} lowland areas that have a distinct flora and species composition. Because ecosystems react differently to different management practices, it is important that a description and classification of the vegetation of an area be done. As part of a vegetation survey programme for the newly acquired farms incorporated into the Mountain Zebra National Park, the vegetation of the Ingleside and Welgedacht sections were surveyed following the Braun-Blanquet approach. From a Twinspan classification, refined by Braun-Blanquet procedures, 10 shrub and grassland plant communities, which can be grouped into seven major groups, were identified. A classification and description of these communities, as well as a vegetation map are presented. The diagnostic species as well as the prominent and less conspicuous species of the tree, shrub, herb and grass strata are outlined. The area generally comprises lowland communities and higher-lying communities. The lower-lying communities consist mainly of two communities and comprise the largest proportion of the <b>area</b> <b>in</b> <b>hectares.</b> <b>In</b> contrast, the higher-lying communities are more diverse with specific habitats. Using the Ecological Index Method the veld condition and grazing capacity were calculated for each community and the total study area. Large sections of the lowland areas are overgrazed due to previous farming grazing practices while the higher-lying areas that were less accessible to the animals are in a slightly better condition. Overall this has resulted <b>in</b> the <b>area</b> generally being degraded within a high grazing capacity of 30. 1 ha/LSU...|$|R

The methodology developed for soybean classification was named Modis crop detection algorithm (MCDA). The MCDA provides soybean <b>area</b> <b>estimates</b> <b>in</b> December (first forecast), using images from the sowing period, and March (second forecast), using images from the sowing and maximum crop development periods.
