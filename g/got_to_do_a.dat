25|$|Chris Onstad {{was born}} June 14, 1975, in California {{and grew up}} in a small town near Sonora, in the Sierra foothills. Onstad {{attended}} Stanford University, where he edited the Stanford Chaparral humor magazine. Onstad has published several books: nine anthologies of Achewood comics; a humorous cookbook featuring recipes purportedly invented by the strip's characters; A Wonderful Tale, a book written {{from the perspective of a}} character from the strip; and that same character's second novel A Hilarious Comedy. He has also published six editions of Man Why You Even <b>Got</b> <b>to</b> <b>Do</b> <b>a</b> Thing, an Achewood-centric zine.|$|E
25|$|Roast Beef's {{birthday}} is April 22. Some of his accomplishments include {{a program that}} determines how many eggs and how much milk you need to buy in a given week, and another that determines the amount of loose change lying around your house and makes a reservation at a restaurant accordingly. Roast Beef is partial to UNIX and his preferred programming language is Java. He likes Stella Artois beer and Guinness. He is perhaps the world's greatest historian of the Great Outdoor Fight, and drove Ray to compete (and win) in the 2006 Fight. He also managed {{to get into the}} Fight himself by hacking the Fight's database. He fully accepted the fact that Ray would have to beat him senseless in order to win, and was shocked beyond belief when Ray destroyed the Fight rather than fight him. He drives a 1965 Ford Galaxie (powered by Ford's rare 427 SOHC V8 engine) that was a gift from Ray. He has also gone to the moon, by stealing Pat's home-made rocket, and to the afterlife (both heaven and hell), via various methods including some of the aforementioned shooting incidents and vomiting into an electrical outlet. He has also produced his very own zine, titled Man Why You Even <b>Got</b> <b>To</b> <b>Do</b> <b>A</b> Thing.|$|E

5000|$|In a 2011 interview, Skolnick {{had this}} to say about his time with Savatage: Savatage was a very {{bittersweet}} situation. On the one hand I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>an</b> album with a band that I liked in high school. The flipside is that the gig came about because of a tragedy: Savatage guitarist Criss Oliva had passed away in 1993. That was around the time that I had left my band, Testament, because things hadn't been working out, and I found playing with Savatage appealing. It was like, [...] "Hey, why not?" [...] Then again, I knew I was heading in a different direction from the band, but I just didn't know where. For some reason, joining Savatage just didn't feel right. I'm not sure why that is ... It wasn't one particular thing. Maybe I felt I needed to ... be one of the main creative voices in the band. If I had stayed with Savatage I wouldn't have been.|$|R

5000|$|Guitarist Benji Madden {{wrote on}} the band's website that Good Charlotte {{released}} the song to show appreciation of their patient fan base: [...] "We always put a song on every record that's there just for fun and this is that song." [...] He also explained to Alternative Press that it [...] "has a good mix of the old-school sound from our self-titled record from 2000, and the sound we explored on Good Morning Revival in 2007.: Guitarist Billy Martin discussed his contribution to the song during an interview with Unrescuable Schizo: [...] "I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> guitar solo in it. I've been pushing to do some guitar solos for years. I <b>got</b> <b>to</b> <b>do</b> <b>a</b> really cool one on that song so that was definitely a highlight for me. It's a fairly pop song for us. It's still rock, it's very guitar-heavy but it's sort of a real pop melody. By putting a big rock guitar solo {{in the middle of}} the song, it gives it a nice edge. I like that fine line between being a rock band and writing pop songs." ...|$|E
