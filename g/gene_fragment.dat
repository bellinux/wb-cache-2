More complex minigenes can be constructed containing multiple exons and intron(s). Minigenes provide a valuable tool for researchers evaluating splicing patterns both in vivo and in vitro biochemically assessed experiments. Specifically, minigenes are used as splice reporter vectors (also called exon-trapping vectors) and act as a probe to determine which factors are important in splicing outcomes. They can be constructed to test the way both cis-regulatory elements (RNA effects) and trans-regulatory elements (associated proteins/splicing factors) affect gene expression.|$|E

40|$|Gene {{silencing}} is {{a process}} of suppressing activity of specific genes by producing “interfering” RNA encoded by foreign genes. This process serves as the principle of genetic modification in plants and animals, which is an important tool in genomics and biotechnology, allowing scientists to manipulate organisms to better meet human demands. New approaches of gene silencing may enable improvements on current practices of genetic modification, and broaden the application and impact of gene silencing in biotechnology. Recently, a novel vector design consisting of the transcription of short <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> lacking transcription termination signals was demonstrated to be effective in partial silencing of two separate genes in the model plant, Arabidopsis thaliana. To test the efficacy of this unterminated transgene technique on a broader range of genes in A. thaliana, a DNA vector to clone <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> was required. The objective {{of the present study was}} to design a silencing vector for rapid cloning of <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> and test its utility on new genes. Here, we report the successful construction of a simple transgene vector, pSJN 15 A, for cloning <b>gene</b> <b>fragments,</b> then plant transformation upon Agrobacterium infection. The pSJN 15 A vector was designed for direct cloning of <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> obtained by polymerase chain reaction. Transcription of <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> is directed by read-through activity of a hygromycin resistance gene promoter. The pSJN 15 A vector was used to develop silencing vectors against four new Arabidopsis genes. Thus, pSJN 15 A serves as an important DNA resource for testing the efficacy of silencing mediated by the transcription of <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> in various dicotyledonous plant species...|$|R

50|$|They {{are used}} to assist {{insertion}} of genes into plasmid vectors during gene cloning and protein production experiments. For optimal use, plasmids that are commonly used for gene cloning are modified to include a short polylinker sequence (called the multiple cloning site, or MCS) rich in restriction enzyme recognition sequences. This allows flexibility when inserting gene fragments into the plasmid vector; restriction sites contained naturally within genes influence the choice of endonuclease for digesting the DNA, since {{it is necessary to}} avoid restriction of wanted DNA while intentionally cutting the ends of the DNA. To clone a <b>gene</b> <b>fragment</b> into a vector, both plasmid DNA and gene insert are typically cut with the same restriction enzymes, and then glued together with the assistance of an enzyme known as a DNA ligase.|$|E

25|$|Unlike most genes, {{which have}} a stable {{sequence}} in each cell which expresses them, the T cell receptor {{is made up of}} a series of alternative <b>gene</b> <b>fragments.</b> In order to create a functional T cell receptor, the double negative thymocytes use a series of DNA-interacting enzymes to clip the DNA and bring separate <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> together. The outcome of this process is that each T cell receptor has a different sequence, due to different choice of <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> and the errors introduced during the cutting and joining process (see section on V(D)J recombination for more information on TCR rearrangement). The evolutionary advantage in having a large number of unique T cell receptors is that each T cell is capable of recognizing a different peptide, providing a defense against rapidly evolving pathogens.|$|R

50|$|Muller et al. (1990) {{were one}} of the first to explore the causes of gametangium defects in E. siliculosus {{originating}} from New Zealand. The researchers identified reproductive cells of E. siliculosus filled with hexagonal particles which were then released into culture medium when the cells burst. Following release of these particles, sporophytes became infected, shown by pathological symptoms, suggesting that the particles are viruses. Such studies allowed for the evaluation of infection potential of E. siliculosus viruses. Using PCR amplification of a viral <b>gene</b> <b>fragment,</b> Muller et al. (2005) monitored levels of pathogen infection in Ectocarpus samples from the Gran Canaria Island, North Atlantic and southern Chile. The researchers found high levels of pathogen prevalence; 40-100% of Ectocarpus specimens contained viral DNA. Similar estimates have been given by Sengco et al. (1996) who estimated that at least 50% of Ectocarpus plants in the world contain viral DNA. This high frequency of viral infection among globally distributed Ectocarpus plants has interesting ecological implications. Viral infection by EsV-1 in E. siliculosus plants, as mentioned, limits reproductive success of infected plants. Thus, the EsV-1 virus plays a key role in regulating populations of E. siliculosus, having further effects on local ecosystem dynamics.|$|E
5000|$|In {{order to}} provide a good {{minigene}} model, the <b>gene</b> <b>fragment</b> should {{have all of the}} necessary elements to ensure it exhibits the same alternative splicing (AS) patterns as the wild type gene, i.e., the length of the fragment must include all upstream and downstream sequences which can affect its splicing. Therefore, most minigene designs begin with a thorough in silico analysis of the requirements of the experiment before any [...] "wet" [...] lab work is conducted. With the advent of Bioinformatics and widespread use of computers, several good programs now exist for the identification of cis-acting control regions that affect the splicing outcomes of a gene [...] and advanced programs can even consider splicing outcomes in various tissue types. Differences in minigenes are usually reflected in the final size of the fragment, which is in turn a reflection of the complexity of the minigene itself. The number of foreign DNA elements (exon and introns) inserted into the constitutive exons and introns of a given fragment varies with the type of experiment and the information being sought. A typical experiment might involve wild type minigenes which are expected to express genes normally in a comparison run against genetically engineered allelic variations which replace the wild-type gene and have been cloned into the same flanking sequences as the original fragment. These types of experiments help to determine the effect of various mutations on pre-mRNA splicing.|$|E

40|$|Phenazines show antibacterial, antifungal, {{antiviral}} and cytotoxic activities [15, 33]. On the one hand, {{this class}} of metabolites presents a great potential for pharmaceutical applications. An example is clofazimine 9 which is already established as an antileprosy agent [47]. On the other hand, phenazines are very important in the biocontrol of phytopathogenic fungi. Pseudomonas chlororaphis M 342 for example is used for seed treatment against fungal diseases [45]. Due to the biotechnological applications of the phenazines, the goal set within this Master’s Thesis was the detection of phenazines producing bacteria from marine habitats. Two approaches were performed. The genetic approach includes PCR amplification of two phz <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> as markers for the ability to produce phenazines. The amplification method of Mavrodi et al. (2010) was used to demonstrate phzF <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> [48], whereas the primer system of Schneemann et al.

The cultivation-based approach comprises cultivation and extraction of bacterial strains and subsequent chemical analysis with HPLC-MS. In order to accomplish this method, the terrestrial P. chlororaphis strains and S. cinnamonensis DSM 1042 T are used as controls, because these strains are known producers of phenazines. Following the establishment of the method, strains from environments were investigated. PCR amplification of both phz <b>gene</b> <b>fragments</b> was accomplished for 56 bacterial strains comprising four control strains and 52 marine strains. 17 strains showed positive results using phzE primers and only six strains exhibited phzF <b>gene</b> <b>fragments.</b> These results clearly demonstrated that the application of the phzE primer system of Schneemann et al.
