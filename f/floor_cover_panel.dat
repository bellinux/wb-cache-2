40|$|An {{analysis}} and design method is presented {{for the design}} of composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> that include the transverse shear effects and damage tolerance considerations. This method is incorporated into a sandwich optimization computer program entitled SANDOP. As a demonstration of its capabilities, SANDOP is {{used in the present study}} to design optimized composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> for for transport aircraft wing applications. The results of this design study indicate that optimized composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> have approximately the same structural efficiency as stiffened composite <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> designed to satisfy individual constraints. The results also indicate that inplane stiffness requirements have a large effect on the weight of these composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> at higher load levels. Increasing the maximum allowable strain and the upper percentage limit of the 0 degree and +/- 45 degree plies can yield significant weight savings. The results show that the structural efficiency of these optimized composite sandwich <b>cover</b> <b>panels</b> is relatively insensitive to changes in core density. Thus, core density should be chosen by criteria other than minimum weight (e. g., damage tolerance, ease of manufacture, etc.) ...|$|R

40|$|Like {{many other}} fruits, table grapes depend on {{accurate}} temperature management during transport in maritime refrigerated containers. Ideally the temperature inside the container {{is equal to}} set point in every location in the container. Unfortunately door-end temperatures are always higher due to poor air flow distribution. In climate chamber tests Lukasse & Staal (2016 a and 2016 b) investigated the effect of covering sections of the container’s T-bar floor. The best T-bar <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> found in that study was a trapezoid-shape <b>floor</b> <b>cover.</b> The {{aim of this study}} is to assess the effect of that trapezoid-shape T-bar <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> on temperature and fruit quality in commercial reefer container transports of grapes. A field experiment was done in a commercial container shipment of six standard 40 ft. HC reefer containers travelling from South Africa to The Netherlands taking 24 days. The three test containers contained a T-bar <b>floor</b> <b>cover.</b> The three reference containers did not contain the T-bar <b>floor</b> <b>cover.</b> All other parameters were, to the extent possible, the same for all containers. In 31 locations air temperature between the fruit was logged at an interval of 10 min. with an accuracy of approx. ± 0. 1 °C. 15 Trays, evenly distributed in a vertical plane on the container’s longitudinal centre line, were weighed at origin and at destination. At destination the fruit quality of these 15 trays was analysed. A clear positive effect on temperature was observed. The <b>floor</b> <b>cover</b> reduces the average difference between warmest and coldest temperature in the trays by approx. 30 %. An effect on grape quality could not be assessed...|$|R
