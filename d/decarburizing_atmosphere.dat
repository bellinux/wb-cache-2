50|$|Silicon {{significantly}} {{increases the}} electrical resistivity of the steel, which decreases the induced eddy currents and narrows the hysteresis loop of the material, thus lowering the core loss. However, the grain structure hardens and embrittles the metal, which adversely affects the workability of the material, especially when rolling it. When alloying, the concentration levels of carbon, sulfur, oxygen and nitrogen {{must be kept}} low, as these elements indicate the presence of carbides, sulfides, oxides and nitrides. These compounds, even in particles as small as one micrometer in diameter, increase hysteresis losses while also decreasing magnetic permeability. The presence of carbon has a more detrimental effect than sulfur or oxygen. Carbon also causes magnetic aging when it slowly leaves the solid solution and precipitates as carbides, thus resulting {{in an increase in}} power loss over time. For these reasons, the carbon level is kept to 0.005% or lower. The carbon level can be reduced by annealing the steel in a <b>decarburizing</b> <b>atmosphere,</b> such as hydrogen.|$|E
40|$|The {{effect of}} carbon content on the creep {{behaviour}} of Ni Cr 22 Co 12 Mo (INCONEL 617) and X 10 NiCrAlTi 3220 H (INCOLOY 800 H) {{has been investigated}} at 850 and 950 °C. In addition to the examination of heats of different carbon content, commercial heats (carbon content 0. 08 wt. -%) were carburized before or during testing. Tests on the commercial alloys in a <b>decarburizing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> were also carried out. Pre-carburized specimens exhibited a significantly higher creep rupture strength than solution treated specimens and specimens tested in a carburizing atmosphere. The tests on alloys of different initial carbon contents showed that the secondary creep rate decreased with increasing carbon content. Specimens which were tested in a <b>decarburizing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> exhibited a very high creep rate {{after only a few}} hours of testing. The rupture times for specimens tested in the <b>decarburizing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> were an order of magnitude shorter than those of specimens tested in air or in carburizing atmospheres at the same temperature and stress. The very low creep rupture strength of the decarburized material is attributed to the absence of grain boundary carbides, with the result that grain boundary sliding was enhanced. Consequently the rapid formation of grain boundary pores and cracks occurred...|$|E
40|$|Oil pump rotors used in today’s {{automobiles}} are a {{good example}} of powder metal part usage. The performance of the oil pump is closely related to the wear behavior of these rotors. The wear of the rotors also affects the contamination of the lubrication system of the automobile with wear debris. In this work, PM rotors consisting of iron based powder were evaluated with respect to their wear properties. The rotors evaluated in this investigation were sintered in atmospheres with the following carbon potential: 0. 2 %, 0. 4 %, 0. 6 %, and 0. 8 %. The resulting parts showed carbon contents approximately equal to the carbon potential of the atmosphere. The microstructure consisted of ferrite and pearlite phases, with an increasing pearlite fraction as the carbon level increases. The maximum density obtained was 7. 16 g/cm 3 in the sample with 0. 6 % carbon. In cases where a carburizing or <b>decarburizing</b> <b>atmosphere</b> was used, the densities were shown to decrease down to as low as 7. 05 g/cm 3. The hardness of the parts increases from 48 to 90 HRB as the carbon level increases from 0. 2 % to 0. 8 %. Friction coefficient and wear rate against plain carbon steel were evaluated by means of a pin on disc test. The friction coefficient is approximately between 0. 3 and 0. 4. The wear rates show a minimum at the carbon level of 0. 6 %. The effect of carbon content, porosity and microstructure on wear is discussed...|$|E
