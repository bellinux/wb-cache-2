25|$|The second theory uses grip {{placement}} and angle {{as the primary}} factor in targeting each head. For instance, to target the long head when using dumbbells or cables, the grip should be semi-supinated (hammer) grip where the palms face each other. <b>If</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> barbell (EZ grip or straight), the grip should be inside of shoulder width. To target the short head when using dumbbells or cables, grip should be supinated, where the palms are facing up completely. <b>If</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> barbell (EZ grip or straight), grip should be outside of shoulder width.|$|E

25|$|Within MBTA's {{bus service}} area, {{transfers}} from the subway are free <b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> CharlieCard (for local buses); transfers {{to the subway}} require paying the difference between bus and the higher subway fare (for local buses; if not using a CharlieCard, full subway fare must be paid in addition to full bus fare). Bus-to-bus transfers (for local buses) are free unless paying cash. Many of the outlying routes run express along major highways to downtown. The buses are colored yellow on maps and in station decor.|$|E
25|$|Pesticide {{leaching}} {{occurs when}} pesticides mix {{with water and}} move through the soil, ultimately contaminating groundwater. The amount of leaching is correlated with particular soil and pesticide characteristics {{and the degree of}} rainfall and irrigation. Leaching is most likely to happen <b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> water-soluble pesticide, when the soil tends to be sandy in texture; if excessive watering occurs just after pesticide application; if the adsorption ability of the pesticide to the soil is low. Leaching may not only originate from treated fields, but also from pesticide mixing areas, pesticide application machinery washing sites, or disposal areas.|$|E
25|$|Provided {{that road}} safety is not jeopardised, and to enable a driver {{to reach a}} {{suitable}} stopping place, {{a departure from the}} EU rules may be permitted to the extent necessary {{to ensure the safety of}} persons, the vehicle or its load. Drivers must note all the reasons for doing so on the back of their tachograph record sheets (if using an analogue tachograph) or on a printout or temporary sheet (<b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> digital tachograph) at the latest on reaching the suitable stopping place (see relevant sections covering manual entries). Repeated and regular occurrences, however, might indicate to enforcement officers that employers were not in fact scheduling work to enable compliance with the applicable rules.|$|E

25|$|Since 1998, the DNA {{profiling}} system supported by The National DNA Database in the UK is the SGM+ DNA {{profiling system}} that includes 10 STR regions and a sex-indicating test. STRs do not suffer from such subjectivity and provide similar {{power of discrimination}} (1 in 1013 for unrelated individuals <b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> full SGM+ profile). Figures of this magnitude are {{not considered to be}} statistically supportable by scientists in the UK; for unrelated individuals with full matching DNA profiles a match probability of 1 in a billion is considered statistically supportable. However, with any DNA technique, the cautious juror should not convict on genetic fingerprint evidence alone if other factors raise doubt. Contamination with other evidence (secondary transfer) is a key source of incorrect DNA profiles and raising doubts as to whether a sample has been adulterated is a favorite defense technique. More rarely, chimerism is one such instance where the lack of a genetic match may unfairly exclude a suspect.|$|E

A hand cannot be got to the nose <b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> full facemask. Many eyes-and-nose diving masks have two small pockets in their underside, or are like goggles with the soft edge extended downwards over the nose, to let two fingers reach the nose and pinch it.|$|E
2500|$|With most railway {{stations}} {{not having}} ticket-operated barriers and trams not having conductors, enforcement {{was and is}} still the responsibility of roaming Authorised Officers (ticket inspectors). Authorised Officers (AOs) check that passengers have the correct ticket and, <b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> concession ticket, have a suitable concession card. AOs did not issue fines directly but issue an infringement notice. The passenger then {{received a letter from}} the Department of Transport, who may issue a fine. Passengers can either pay the fine, or contest it by letter or in court.However, now passengers have the option to pay a $75 on-the-spot fine, something that wasn't available until recently.|$|E

2500|$|There {{are several}} reasons for this division. When more than one band plays in a single performance, the drum kit is often {{considered}} part of the backline (the key rhythm section equipment that stays on stage all night, which often also includes a bass amp and a stage piano), and which is shared between/among the drummers. Often the main [...] "drawcard" [...] act will provide the drums, as they are being paid more, possibly have the better gear, and in any case have the prerogative of using their own. However sticks, snare drum and cymbals are commonly swapped, each drummer bringing their own, and sometimes other components. The term breakables in this context refers to whatever basic components the [...] "guest" [...] drummer is expected to bring. Similar considerations apply <b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> [...] "house kit" [...] (a drum kit owned by the venue, which is rare), even if there is only one band at the performance.|$|E
2500|$|Many ESC {{systems have}} an [...] "off" [...] {{override}} switch so the driver can disable ESC, {{which may be}} desirable when badly stuck in mud or snow, or driving on a beach, or <b>if</b> <b>using</b> <b>a</b> smaller-sized spare tire which would interfere with the sensors. Some systems also offer an additional mode with raised thresholds so that a driver can utilize the limits of adhesion with less electronic intervention. However, ESC defaults to [...] "On" [...] when the ignition is restarted. Some ESC systems that lack an [...] "off switch", such as on many recent Toyota and Lexus vehicles, can be temporarily disabled through an undocumented series of brake pedal and handbrake operations. Furthermore, unplugging a wheel speed sensor is another method of disabling most ESC systems. [...] The ESC implementation on newer Ford vehicles cannot be completely disabled even {{through the use of}} the [...] "off switch". [...] The ESC will automatically reactivate at highway speeds, and below that if it detects a skid with the brake pedal depressed.|$|E
