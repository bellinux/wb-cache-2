5000|$|Ironically, Spitznagel {{is largely}} {{indifferent}} {{to the concept of}} “black swan events.” In a 2015 New York Times op-ed titled “The Myth of Black Swan Market Events”, he connected every similar high point in the Tobin's Q-ratio since 1900 (specifically in 1905, 1929, 1936, 1968, 2000, and 2007) with past monetary interventionism and subsequent stock market losses (of -19%, -85%, -36%, -29%, -44%, and -50%, respectively), which he called “perfectly predictable, by economic logic alone”—and thus implied that another crash is coming. Spitznagel has said that a crash ”is not a black swan. But the reason I’m going to still call it a black swan is because the markets still price it as a black swan.” As he wrote in The Dao of Capital: Truly, the real black swan problem of stock market busts is not about a remote event that is considered unforeseeable; rather it is about a <b>foreseeable</b> <b>event</b> that is considered remote.

40|$|The {{contamination}} of seafood by algal toxins regularly affects animals living {{in several areas}} of the world, {{and the number of}} toxic phycotoxins which are being characterized is steadily increasing. The extreme dynamics characterizing the field of algal toxins has stimulated the development of tools to be implemented in the monitoring of {{contamination of}} seafood by individual toxin classes. Under these circumstances, functional assays which can encompass the analytical potential of chemical methods and the predictive features of biological tests are sought. A variety of functional assays for the detection of phycotoxins has been developed in the last 20 years, and the analysis of their features reveals that their specificity is related to the hierarchical level of the biological response to the toxin that has been exploited for its detection. Ideally, analytical methods which could allow accurate estimates of the overall toxicity of multiple classes of toxins in a single procedure would provide the best means for the highest standards in consumer protection and the most rational and economical tools in the management of risks posed by phycotoxins in a wider scale. The achievement of a systemic functional assay for marine biotoxins {{does not appear to be}} at hand, but its inclusion among the <b>foreseeable</b> <b>events</b> is fully justified by the new research tools and approaches which have become available for the high throughput analysis of entire molecular domains at the cellular level.

Since the characteristics and circunstances of the event are closely related to educational, economic, social and cultural issues, identifying them may contribute towards minimizing the causes, which are often fatal.

DESIGN AND SETTING This was a descriptive cross-sectional study conducted in Cuiab&# 225;, Mato Grosso, Brazil.

40|$|Article {{one of the}} First Protocol to the European Convention on Human Rights (“P 1 - 1 ”) {{states that}} every person is {{entitled}} to peaceful enjoyment of his possessions. The role of property interests in allowing political participation had been highlighted during the Second World War, where the Third Reich had weakened political opponents through arbitrary deprivation of possessions. The drafters of the Convention sough to prevent a repeat of this political abuse. However, the political element of property is often secondary to its economic role, in which intervention by the state is necessary and sometimes desirable to allow a national economy to function. How can this inherent conflict in the right to peaceful enjoyment of possessions be resolved? This thesis aims to demonstrate {{the development of the}} role of the property right in Europe and the United Kingdom through a critical analysis of the jurisprudence of the European Court of Human Rights and the domestic courts of the United Kingdom. The central thesis of this research is that, although a framework has been determined within which P 1 - 1 decisions can be taken, there is considerable work to be done in strengthening the parameters of that framework in order to create a protection that, whilst sufficiently flexible to deal with changes in law and society, offers a clearly defined and meaningful safeguard against unnecessary intervention by the state in every context. The conclusion is that a clear decision-making process has been articulated through the European jurisprudence and subsequently adopted with qualified success in the United Kingdom. This process allows for the P 1 - 1 implications of current and <b>foreseeable</b> <b>events</b> to be explored with some degree of certainty. However, the margin of appreciation afforded to states by the judiciary at certain steps of the process, particularly as regards the purported aim of state intervention and the necessity of avoiding payment of compensation in certain situations, compromises the strength of the protection as a whole. ...|$|R
