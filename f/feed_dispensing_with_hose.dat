40|$|In {{order to}} {{increase}} the cost-effectiveness of conventional parabolic trough (PT) fields {{it is essential to}} reduce Capital Expenditure (Capex) as well as Operations and Maintenance (O&M) costs, in particular the need for flexible hosing or rotating joints, which are used because the tubular receiver also tracks in a solidary way with the trough. One possible alternative is to design a different type of optic with the center of mass on the center of the tubular receiver, generating the possibility of it being fixed, thereby <b>dispensing</b> <b>with</b> flexible <b>hosing</b> or rotating joints, without penalizing its overall efficiency or even concentration. In this work, two possible optical solutions, combining parabolic-type primaries with second-stage non-imaging optics concentrators for fixed receivers, are presented. These concentrators are designed using the Simultaneous Multiple Surface (SMS) design method and the infinitesimal etendue limit. A performance comparison with a conventional PT in terms of optical efficiency, CAP (Concentration-Acceptance Product) and other performance data are also presented, including an estimate of the total amount of yearly collected energy (kW h/m 2 of entrance aperture) for one particular location – Faro (Portugal) ...|$|R
40|$|To {{learn how}} to use rangelands profitably, {{livestock}} farmers must have a clear understanding of how they can influence herd behaviour (using external appetite-stimulating factors) to make the animals consume diets consistent with targeted production objectives with minimum external inputs. The feed value of rangelands results to a large extent from the feeding management which {{can take advantage of the}} heterogeneity of pastoral areas (MENU model), a factor usually considered as a structural constraint. The overall palatability of each intake component may be considered to result from its intrinsic palatability (i. e., mainly related to metabolic regulations linked to the digestion process) and from its circumstantial palatability (derived from previous learning by the animals and from the grazing conditions). This leads to characterising the specific roles assigned to individual paddocks in the daily <b>feeding</b> process and <b>dispensing</b> <b>with</b> the "pastoral potential" concept, of little operational value in our conditions. Taking account of the foraging herd's behavioural responses poses new questions to nutrition scientists about the time dimension involved in the feeding process: the short-term effects of interactions between different feeds, of meal sequences during the day, of feed shifts between the grazing seasons and even the long term effects of behavioural learnin...|$|R

50|$|Critique of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics:A {{critique}} of nominalist reconstructions in mathematics was undertaken by Burgess (1983) and Burgess and Rosen (1997). Burgess distinguished {{two types of}} nominalist reconstructions. Thus, hermeneutic nominalism is the hypothesis that science, properly interpreted, already <b>dispenses</b> <b>with</b> mathematical objects(entities) such as numbers and sets. Meanwhile, revolutionary nominalism is the project of replacing current scientific theories by alternatives <b>dispensing</b> <b>with</b> mathematical objects (see Burgess, 1983, p. 96). A recent study extends the Burgessian critique to three nominalistic reconstructions: the reconstruction of analysis by Georg Cantor, Richard Dedekind, and Karl Weierstrass that <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> infinitesimals; the constructivist re-reconstruction of Weiertrassian analysis by Errett Bishop that <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> the law of excluded middle; and the hermeneutic reconstruction, by Carl Boyer, Judith Grabiner, and others, of Cauchy's foundational contribution to analysis that <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> Cauchy's infinitesimals.|$|R

40|$|This paper {{examines}} {{whether the}} reduction in the percentage of cases where bail is <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> (unconditional release) is due to a change in the profile of cases coming before the criminal courts or a general increase in the threshold for <b>dispensing</b> <b>with</b> bail. A series of statistical (logistic regression) models of the likelihood of unconditional release were constructed to see whether the fall in the likelihood of unconditional release over time remained significant after adjusting for other factors associated with the likelihood of unconditional release. Separate models were constructed for three offences: assault, property crime and property damage. The report concludes that {{the reduction in}} matters where bail is <b>dispensed</b> <b>with</b> is not accounted for by a change in the profile of cases coming before the courts. Instead, this appears to reflect an increase in the threshold for <b>dispensing</b> <b>with</b> bail...|$|R
