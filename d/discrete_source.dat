50|$|Traditionally each sensor in an {{aircraft}} {{is treated as}} a <b>discrete</b> <b>source</b> of information; however this can result in conflicting data and limits the scope for the automation of systems, hence increasing pilot workload. To overcome this, the Typhoon employs what are now known as sensor fusion techniques (in a similar fashion to the U.S. F-22 Raptor). In the Typhoon fusion of all data sources is achieved through the Attack and Identification System, or AIS. The AIS combines data from the major on-board sensors along with any information obtained from off-board platforms such as AWACS, ASTOR, and Eurofighter own Multi-function Information Distribution System (MIDS). Additionally the AIS integrates all the other major offensive and defensive systems such as the DASS, Navigation, ACS and Communications. The AIS physically comprises two essentially separate units: the Avionic Computer (AC) and the Navigation Computer (NC), linked via the STANAG-3910 databus to the other major systems such as the ACS, ECR-90/CAPTOR, PIRATE, etc. Both the AC and NC are identical in design, being a modular unit based on Motorola 68020 CPUs with 68882 Maths co-processors, {{as well as several}} custom RISC-based processors utilised to accelerate floating point and matrix operations.|$|E
5000|$|Because each prebend or portion {{provided}} a <b>discrete</b> <b>source</b> of income {{as a separate}} benefice, in the later medieval period canons increasingly tended to be non-resident, paying a vicar to undertake divine service in their place. Kings and bishops came to regard prebends as useful sources of income for favoured servants and supporters, {{and it was not}} uncommon for a bishop or archbishop also to hold half a dozen or more collegiate prebends or deaneries. From the 13th century onwards, existing collegiate foundations (like monasteries) also attracted chantry endowments, usually a legacy in a will providing for masses to be sung for the repose of the souls of the testator and their families by the collegiate clergy or their vicars. The same impetus to establish endowed prayer also led to many new collegiate foundations in this later period; under which an existing parish church would be rebuilt to accommodate a new chantry college; commonly with the intention that the rectory of the parish should be appropriated to support the new foundation. A new organisational structure was developed for these bodies, by which endowment income was held collectively, and each canon received a fixed stipend conditional on being personally resident, such canons being termed fellows, or chaplains led by a warden or master. In this arrangement, only the office of warden constituted a separate benefice; appointment to the individual canonries being at the discretion of the chapter. Chantry colleges still maintained the daily divine office with the additional prime function of offering masses in intercession for departed members of the founder's family; but also typically served charitable or educational purposes, such as providing hospitals or schools. For founders, this presented the added advantage that masses for the repose of themselves and their families endowed in a chantry would be supported by a guaranteed congregation of grateful and virtuous recipients of charity, which conferred a perceived advantage in endowing such a chantry in a parish church over doing so in a monastery. Consequently in the later medieval period, testators consistently tended to favour chantries linked to parochial charitable endowments.|$|E

40|$|A general {{method of}} source coding over {{expansion}} is proposed in this paper, which enables one {{to reduce the}} problem of compressing an analog (continuous-valued source) {{to a set of}} much simpler problems, compressing discrete sources. Specifically, the focus is on lossy compression of exponential and Laplacian sources, which is subsequently expanded using a finite alphabet prior to being quantized. Due to decomposability property of such sources, the resulting random variables post expansion are independent and discrete. Thus, each of the expanded levels corresponds to an independent <b>discrete</b> <b>source</b> coding problem, and the original problem is reduced to coding over these parallel sources with a total distortion constraint. Any feasible solution to the optimization problem is an achievable rate distortion pair of the original continuous-valued source compression problem. Although finding the solution to this optimization problem at every distortion is hard, we show that our expansion coding scheme presents a good solution in the low distrotion regime. Further, by adopting low-complexity codes designed for <b>discrete</b> <b>source</b> coding, the total coding complexity can be tractable in practice. Comment: 8 pages, 3 figure...|$|E
