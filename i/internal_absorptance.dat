40|$|Active layer thickness-dependent {{internal}} quantum efficiencies (IQE) of photocurrent within bulk heterojunction organic photovoltaic (OPV) {{devices were}} characterized. These active layers consisted of an electron-donating narrow band-gap polymer and an electron-accepting fullerene derivative. In order to calculate IQE spectra {{as a function}} of active layer thickness, incident photon-to-current conversion efficiency (IPCE) spectra and <b>internal</b> <b>absorptance</b> spectra of active layers with various thicknesses were estimated in these solar cell devices. The transfer matrix method (TMM) was used to calculate the <b>internal</b> <b>absorptance</b> spectra of active layers by using experimental optical constants of thin layers typical for these types of OPV devices including narrow band-gap polymer blend film. In addition, spatially resolved absorptance spectra were used to analyze obtained IPCE spectra as well as OPV device parameters (e. g., short circuit current density) at various active layer thicknesses. Finally, charge-carrier-collecting probability {{as a function of}} active layer thickness was suggested with which the relationship between initial exciton generation and final power conversion efficiency can be more quantitatively described...|$|E
40|$|We {{introduce}} {{a model for}} charge separation in bulk heterojunction solar cells that combines exciton transport to the interface between donor and acceptor phases with the dissociation of the bound electron/hole pair. We implement this model into a standard semiconductor device simulator, thereby creating a convenient method to simulate the optical and electrical characteristics of a bulk heterojunction solar cell with a commercially available program. By taking into account different collection probabilities for the excitons in the polymer and the fullerene, {{we are able to}} reproduce <b>absorptance,</b> <b>internal</b> and external quantum efficiency, as well as current/voltage curves of bulk heterojunction solar cells. We further investigate the influence of mobilities of the free excitons as well as the mobilities of the free charge carriers on the performance of bulk heterojunction solar cells. We find that, in general, the highest efficiencies are achieved with the highest mobilities. However, an optimum finite mobility of free charge carriers can result from a large recombination velocity at the contacts. In contrast, Langevin-type of recombination cannot lead to finite optimum mobilities even though this mechanism has a strong dependence on the free carrier mobilities.
