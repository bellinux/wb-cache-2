2500|$|Derasah ( [...] ; {{pressing}}/chopping) - The knife must {{be drawn}} across the throat by a {{back and forth}} movement, not by chopping, hacking, or pressing without moving the <b>knife</b> <b>back</b> and forth. There are those who assert that it is forbidden to have the animal in an upright position during shechita due to the prohibition of derasah. They maintain that the animal must be on its back or lying on its side, and some also allow for the animal to be suspended upside down. However, the Rambam explicitly permits upright slaughter, and the Orthodox Union {{as well as all}} other major kosher certifiers in the United States accept upright slaughter.|$|E
2500|$|The two {{perpetrators}} returned, both [...] "walking with a swagger" [...] {{to where}} McIlwaine waited downhill from the parked car with Burcombe. McIlwaine {{at that moment}} made an attempt to run away but Brown, Dillon, and Burcombe {{caught up with him}} as he fell to the ground. Brown gave him a severe kicking, mostly in the head. Dillon produced a butcher's knife and cut McIlwaine's throat while Brown shouted encouragement and Burcombe overlooked the scene from about five feet away. Brown and Dillon left McIlwaine still breathing on the ground; once they were back inside the car, Brown proposed to drive the car over his head, but Dillon dissuaded him. Brown halted the vehicle, took the knife and walked back over to where McIlwaine was lying on the road making a [...] "wheezing" [...] sound. Brown stabbed McIlwaine repeatedly in the face and chest. When he noticed that McIlwaine appeared to be looking up at him, Brown stabbed him deeply in his left eye; the wound penetrated his brain, killing him. According to Burcombe's later testimony, Brown appeared [...] "crazed" [...] as he handed the <b>knife</b> <b>back</b> to Dillon and said he was [...] "buzzing"; he subsequently went on to recount stabbing McIlwaine in the eye. He threatened to cut Burcombe's throat or kill a member of his family if he told anyone what happened.|$|E

50|$|The most {{controversial}} episode remains {{the testimony of}} Cliff Harris, Powell's Bronx friend, interviewed the day {{following the death of}} James Powell. On that morning, they, James Powell, Cliff Harris and Carl Dudley, left the Bronx around 7:30 A.M. Powell carried two knives on that day which he gave to each of his friends to be held for him. On the scene he asked for the <b>knives</b> <b>back.</b> Upon Dudley's refusal he asked Cliff who asked him why he wanted it back? and then handed it over.|$|R
50|$|Numerous {{distinctive}} metal items {{have been}} found in founder's hoards from the Thames valley and Kent that differ from items found elsewhere in Britain. The period was one where experiments in alloying lead with bronze were being used to develop new artefact types some of which have an uncertain purpose. The complex is named after the Carp's tongue sword but other objects include triangular perforated <b>knives,</b> hog's <b>back</b> <b>knives,</b> socketed and end-winged axes, and mysterious bugle-shaped objects.|$|R
60|$|And {{while he}} was {{wondering}} what to do, {{and how to get}} the lady's <b>knife</b> <b>back</b> to her, all at once there was a bump and the tornado tipped him over, sprawled out on the ground. The horses screamed in fear, struggling to pick themselves up. Cole got quickly to his feet.|$|E
60|$|Miss Fosbrook, within herself, {{thought this}} unlikely, for nobody went to Bonchamp for costly shopping; {{and she saw}} that the woman would gladly have had the <b>knife</b> <b>back,</b> if she could have sold the tool-box, which, even at this reduced price, was much too dear for the little boys who frequented the shop.|$|E
60|$|At last he {{gave himself}} a shake, stooped {{and wiped his}} knife and hand and arm upon the loose {{petticoat}} breeches of the dead man. He thrust his <b>knife</b> <b>back</b> into its sheath, drew a key {{from his pocket and}} unlocked the chest. In the moonlight Hiram could see that it was filled mostly with paper and leather bags, full, apparently of money.|$|E

6000|$|MACAIRE. Hell! (He darts {{across to}} the staircase, and turns on the second step, {{flashing}} out the <b>knife.)</b> <b>Back,</b> hounds! (He springs up the stair, and confronts them from the top.) Fools, I am Robert Macaire! (As MACAIRE turns to flee, he is met by the Gendarme coming out of Number Thirteen; he stands an instant checked, is shot from the stage, and falls headlong backward down the stair. BERTRAND, with a cry, breaks from the Gendarmes, kneels at his side, and raises his head.) ...|$|E
6000|$|So saying, {{he thrust}} the <b>knife</b> <b>back</b> again into its sheath, then stooping {{and picking up}} the other, he flung him across his {{shoulder}} like a sack, and running down the steps as lightly as though his load was nothing at all, he carried his burden to the arched doorway whence he had come a little while before. There, having first stripped his prisoner of all his weapons, Hans sat the man up in {{the angle of the}} wall. [...] "So, brother;" [...] said he, [...] "now we can talk with more ease than we could up yonder. I will tell thee frankly why I am here; it is to find where the young Baron Otto of Drachenhausen is kept. If thou canst tell me, well and good; if not, I must e'en cut thy weasand and find me one who knoweth more. Now, canst thou tell me what I would learn, brother?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "After {{the meal}} was done--and I {{prolonged}} {{it as much as}} possible--I saw Hendrika was beginning to get jealous of Tota again. She glared at her and then at the big knife which was tied round her own body. I knew the knife again, it was the one with which she had tried to murder you, dear. At last she {{went so far as to}} draw the knife. I was paralyzed with fear, then suddenly I remembered that when she was our servant, and used to get out of temper and sulk, I could always calm her by singing to her. So I began to sing hymns. Instantly she forgot her jealousy and put the <b>knife</b> <b>back</b> into its sheath. She knew the sound of the singing, and sat listening to it with a rapt face; the baboons, too, crowded in at the entrance of the cave to listen. I must have sung for an hour or more, all the hymns that I could remember. It was so very strange and dreadful sitting there singing to mad Hendrika and those hideous man-like apes that shut their eyes and nodded their great heads as I sang. It was a horrible nightmare; but I believe that the baboons are almost as human as the Bushmen.|$|E

5000|$|Ephraim Newhouse - Ephraim Newhouse was the Talon of 1665. However, his sloppiness {{forced the}} court to retire him, {{stripping}} him of his weapons and armor with a mark of disgrace on his record. Four of his knives were stolen by Catwoman centuries later. During the Night of the Owls storyline, Ephraim was revived and sent by the Court to assassinate Oswald Cobblepot. By sheer coincidence, the Penguin was in possession of the fifth knife which Catwoman had set her own sights on. In the ensuing conflict, Catwoman saved the Penguin's life and promised the five <b>knives</b> <b>back</b> to the Talon preying on his need for redemption {{in the eyes of}} the Court of Owls. The Penguin shot him through the head before an exchange could be made, and so Catwoman - feeling as though she and the Talon were kindred spirits - laid his body on the roof of Gotham City Police Department with his five knives and turned on the Bat-Signal.|$|R

He claimed to have been urged to the attack by his fellow prisoners, and to have been drunk at the time. He insisted that he did not intend to kill the warder. The warder spoke in Bushell's defence saying he did not believe the prisoner intended to harm him. [...] Bushell was nonetheless found guilty and sentenced to death. He was hanged three days later on 12 September 1865.|$|E
