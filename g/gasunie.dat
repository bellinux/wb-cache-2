2500|$|Apart {{from coal}} and gas, {{the country has}} no mining resources. The last coal mine was closed in 1974. The Groningen gas field, {{one of the largest}} natural gas fields in the world, is {{situated}} near Slochteren. Exploitation of this field has resulted in €159billion in revenue since the mid-1970s. The field is operated by government-owned <b>Gasunie</b> and output is jointly exploited by the government, Royal Dutch Shell, and Exxon Mobil through NAM (Nederlandse Aardolie Maatschappij). [...] "Gas extraction has resulted in increasingly strong earth tremors, some measuring as much as 3.6 on the Richter magnitude scale. The cost of damage repairs, structural improvements to buildings, and compensation for home value decreases has been estimated at 6.5 billion euros. Around 35,000 homes are said to be affected." [...] The Netherlands have an estimated 25% of natural gas reserves in the EU.|$|E

50|$|N.V. Nederlandse <b>Gasunie</b> (short form: <b>Gasunie)</b> is a Dutch {{natural gas}} {{infrastructure}} and transportation company {{operating in the}} Netherlands and Germany. <b>Gasunie</b> owns the Netherlands gas transmission network with a total length of over 12000 km and 3100 km long network in Germany.|$|E
50|$|In 2005 {{the company}} was divided into a gas trading company (now called GasTerra) and a gas {{transportation}} company which kept the name <b>Gasunie.</b> The latter owns and operates most of the Dutch gas transmission network {{as well as the}} former BEB pipeline network in Germany, and a major pipeline connecting The Netherlands with the United Kingdom called the BBL Pipeline. In 2005, the split of <b>Gasunie</b> took place through a buy out by the Dutch State of the shares held by Shell and ExxonMobil in the infrastructure part of <b>Gasunie.</b> Therefore, <b>Gasunie</b> is now 100% state owned. The Dutch Ministry of Finance represents the Government's shareholder interest. Ownership of GasTerra is divided the same way as <b>Gasunie</b> before 2005.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Gasunie</b> owns 60% of the BBL Pipeline {{between the}} Netherlands and England. It also has 9% of shares in Nord Stream AG, the project {{company for the}} Nord Stream {{pipeline}}.

50|$|Before 2005, the <b>Gasunie</b> was {{authorized}} to both sell and transport natural gas {{discovered in the}} Netherlands. Due to the liberalisation of the European gas market, transportation and trade and supply had to be separated into independent companies. In 2005, this separation took place, creating both GasTerra and a natural gas transportation company. The last company kept the original name, <b>Gasunie.</b>|$|E
