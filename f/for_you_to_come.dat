Kingsley wrote to the poet Philip Larkin in April 1969: [...] "This is a bloody great mansion, {{in the depths of}} the country though only 15 miles from the centre, and with lots of room <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and spend the night." ...|$|E
500|$|In the {{beginning}} of the episode, Liz tells Jenna about a bad date that she had with someone she met on the personals section of the Kraft Foods web site, K-date. Pete congratulates Danny on his Juno Award nomination for his Canadian pump-up song for the National Hockey League team, the Ottawa Senators. Danny replies, [...] "It's an honor to be nominated in the same category as Sir Dave Coulier", the latter is an American actor. Liz imitates singer-songwriter Christopher Cross while singing [...] "All my days I've been waiting, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back home. Moonlight of New York City", after revealing that she hoped to end up with Floyd one day and Cross would sing a romantic song about them. This song would be extended on the 30 Rock Original Television Soundtrack by Cross himself. Liz makes reference to the fact that once, on television, one could not say the word [...] "crap", but [...] "then they let that slide and now we can say whatever we want." [...] She and Jack exchange the words, [...] "Douchebag", [...] "asswipe", and [...] "Anal rot", as examples. Later, Liz tells Jack, [...] "I don't care. I'll start my own group. Rejection from society is what created the X-Men", which references the comic book superhero team, the X-Men, who are rejected from society due to their mutant special powers.|$|E
500|$|Olivia became {{concerned}} about her daughter after Hilda Doolittle, who also believed she was engaged to Pound, arrived in London in 1911. Olivia welcomed H.D. to her home, but she witnessed the interactions between Dorothy, Pound, H.D. and Richard Aldington, whom H.D. married in 1913. In September 1912 Olivia wrote a stern letter to Pound, in which she pointedly told him to break off his friendship with Dorothy:You {{told me you were}} prepared to see less of Dorothy this winter. I don't know if you wd rather leave it to me to say I don't think it advisable she should see so much of you etc. or whether you wd rather do it in your own way.... I don't know if she still considers herself engaged to you—but she obviously can't marry you—it's hardly decent! There's another point too—which is the personal inconvenience & bother to myself—I had all last winter, practically to keep 2 days a week <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> & see her... She must marry—She & I can't possibly go on living this feminine life practically à deux for ever, & we haven't money enough to separate... You ought to go away—Englishmen don't understand yr American ways, & any man who wanted to marry her wd be put off by the fact of yr friendship (or whatever you call it) with her. If you had ₤500 a year I should be delighted for you to marry her! ...|$|E

[...] "Is it not foolish <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> hither <b>to</b> this place, and then not submit to the ways thereof, {{as the rest of us}} do?" ...|$|R
6000|$|And his Soul mocked him and said, 'Surely thou hast {{but little}} joy out of thy love. Thou art {{as one who}} in time of death pours water into a broken vessel. Thou givest away what thou hast, and nought is given <b>to</b> <b>thee</b> in return. It were better <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> with me, <b>for</b> I know where the Valley of Pleasure lies, and what things are wrought there.' ...|$|R
6000|$|Hal obeyed the summons, {{and coming}} forward put a knee to the ground, while Sir Lancelot Threlkeld uttered the {{conventional}} blessing, adding, 'Fair son, I am glad <b>to</b> see <b>thee.</b> Would {{that we might}} be better acquainted, but I fear it is not safe <b>for</b> <b>thee</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and be trained for knighthood in my poor house. Thou art a well grown lad, I rejoice to see, and strong and hearty I have no doubt.' ...|$|R
500|$|Olajuwon has {{referred}} to basketball as a science, and described his signature move in vivid detail: [...] "When the point guard throws me the ball, I jump to get the ball. But this jump is the set-up for the second move, the baseline move. I call it the 'touch landing.' The defender is {{waiting for me to}} come down because I jumped but I’m gone before I land. Defenders say 'Wow, he's quick,' but they don’t know that where I’m going is predetermined. He's basing it on quickness, but the jump is to set him up. Before I come down, I make my move. When you jump, you turn as you land. Boom! The defender can’t react because he's waiting <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down to defend you. Now, the first time when you showed that quickness, he has to react to that quickness, so you can fake baseline and go the other way with your jump hook. All {{this is part of the}} Dream Shake. The Dream Shake is you dribble and then you jump; now you don’t have a pivot foot. When I dribble I move it so when I come here, I jump. By jumping, I don’t have a pivot foot now. I dribble so now I can use either foot. I can go this way or this way. So he's frozen, he doesn’t know which way I’m going to go. That is the shake. You put him in the mix and you jump stop and now you have choice of pivot foot. He doesn’t know where you’re gonna turn and when." ...|$|E
2500|$|The series writer, Julian Fellowes, {{himself a}} Roman Catholic, {{explains}} that he chose to address {{this in terms of}} [...] "that casual, almost unconscious anti-Catholicism that was found among the upper classes, which lasted well into my growing up years." [...] Fellowes also stated that he [...] "thought it might be interesting" [...] to explore this in the series and described his own experiences where the British upper classes [...] "were happy <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> to their dances or shoot their pheasants, but there were plenty who did not want you to marry their daughters and risk Catholic grandchildren." ...|$|E
60|$|TWISDEN. My dear Mrs Dancy, there's no need at all <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> down to-morrow; take a {{rest and}} nurse your head.|$|E
6000|$|... "I am {{very sorry}} to trouble you," [...] he said, [...] "but I {{think it would}} be better <b>for</b> <b>you</b> all <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Bow Street and see the superintendent." ...|$|R
60|$|That is no excuse, sir. When <b>you</b> {{are sent}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> are <b>to</b> <b>come.</b> Understand? That bill was {{reported}} back. Why was it reported back? You told Dobleman <b>you</b> would attend <b>to</b> it.|$|R
6000|$|... "You must do that. I {{consider}} you {{are perfectly}} safe, {{but at the}} same time your father will think <b>you</b> ought not <b>to</b> be here, and blame me <b>for</b> allowing <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> in; and, worst of all, he will wire <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out." ...|$|R
60|$|YOUNG MAN. [With {{a sort of}} awe] Anyway it {{must have}} been like riding at a pretty stiff fence, <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here to-night.|$|E
6000|$|... "I met {{him twice}} in the road near here yesterday," [...] said Mrs. Clowes, suddenly. [...] "Perhaps he was waiting <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Thank you a {{thousand}} times! {{you have given}} me all the help I want. I'll be here before eleven, waiting <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> out." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'We all think, now Theodora {{is going}} to leave us, {{that it would be}} the best way <b>for</b> <b>you</b> all <b>to</b> <b>come</b> and live at home with us. Lord Martindale wishes it, and John, and every one. Will you, my dear?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'My good friend!' said old Martin, laying {{his hand}} on Chuffey's sleeve. 'This is no place <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> remain in. <b>Come</b> with me.' ...|$|R
60|$|AUNT JUDY. Ah then, {{how could}} you stay at a public house? They'd have no place <b>to</b> put <b>you</b> {{even if it was}} a right place <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> go. <b>Come!</b> is it the sofa you're afraid of? If it is, you can have me own bed. I can sleep with Nora.|$|R
6000|$|... "No, son, you're not. An' {{you never}} will be. But you've {{got to be}} an outlaw till time makes it safe <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> home." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Come up," [...] he said. [...] "You {{have been}} down there long enough. No {{matter what you}} have found, it is time <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> up." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'I {{thought of}} you, too, Ferdinand, all day, all night. And I longed <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> back. I {{did not know}} till you went that--I loved you.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, what? I'll {{speak about}} having any horse you please taken up <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> ride; I <b>came</b> over on Brown Ben, {{but he would}} shake you too much." ...|$|R
6000|$|... 'It {{is not his}} {{interest}} {{that you should be}} harmed yet awhile. He had reasons <b>for</b> wishing <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> Castle Grosbois. But I have been very frank with you, and I wish <b>you</b> <b>to</b> be equally so with me. Does it happen--does it happen that during your youth in England you have ever--you have ever had an affair of the heart?' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "That's {{the way to}} talk, Mr. Grisley. You {{give him}} ten dollars and you keep the fifteen dollars for your own trouble," [...] cried Tom. [...] "So far as I can see he hasn't done {{anything}} <b>for</b> <b>you</b> excepting <b>to</b> <b>come</b> here <b>to</b> see Mr. Sanderson, and certainly such a trip as this isn't worth more than ten dollars." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{have thought}} of that," [...] said Mordecai. [...] "It is not hard <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into this {{neighborhood}} later in the evening? You did so once." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Oh, well, never mind," [...] she said. [...] "You needn't. I've {{got some}} picture books <b>for</b> <b>you</b> <b>to</b> look at. <b>Come</b> {{and sit on}} my lap, and we'll look at them together." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "We {{shall be}} very glad {{if you will}} dine with us, tomorrow," [...] Captain O'Halloran said. [...] "We dine at one o'clock or, if that would be {{inconvenient}} <b>for</b> <b>you,</b> <b>come</b> <b>to</b> supper at seven." ...|$|R

6000|$|... "Never mind, Hans," [...] I said, [...] "it {{is only a}} scratch, and I {{will make}} you a present of some new trousers. Also, here is tobacco <b>for</b> <b>you.</b> <b>Come</b> <b>to</b> the bush; let us talk." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} {{you would not}} be able to find your way, Miss Thurwell," [...] he said quietly. [...] "I must {{apologize}} <b>for</b> asking <b>you</b> <b>to</b> <b>come</b> into such a den. The small engraving on the wall is the proof 'Bartolozzi' I spoke <b>to</b> <b>you</b> about.
