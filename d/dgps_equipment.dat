Each device provides full assistance in search and rescue operations, and therefore must be of an officially high standard. The comprehensive electronics fit includes full radio equipment including Navtex Multi-Frequency, Marine Very High Frequency and DSC installations. For navigation the crew utilize an array of digital select systems including <b>DGPS</b> <b>equipment,</b> and an electronic Laserplot chart display and information system which allows complete automated management via the vessel's on-board processors (autohelm), although comparatively infrequent in practice.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A 9. 8 km of main {{logging road}} was mapped at Perak Integrated Timber Complex (PITC) in Perak State, {{northern}} part of Peninsular Malaysia to identify of their inventories. Logging road features, length of road section, height of cut-fill slopes, longitudinal slope, steepness, length of slope factor, roadside drain, drainage structures, were located to sub-meter accuracy with {{differential global positioning system}} (<b>DGPS)</b> <b>equipment</b> and described while traversing the logging road. The DGPS data were exported into Geographic Information System (GIS) format. Road features were coupled with existed terrain data for analysis. The results {{of this study indicate that}} feasible to estimate the amount of soil loss from the main logging road and the cost-effective of detailed mapping program to characterize system variability and identifying spatial relationships. The results of this study indicate the effectiveness of a one-time detailed mapping program to characterize system and identify spatial relationships of logging roads syste...|$|E
40|$|Quantified, {{performance}} indicators for dynamic mode Differential GPS (DGPS) were collected at 31 sites estab-lished under 3 canopy classes (none, pre-first thinning and mature) of Sitka spruce stands in Ireland with varying altitude (100 - 500 m) and aspect. Canopy cover was quan-tified using total obstruction, size of largest opening and fragmentation of sky view. At sites with no canopy above 2 m, a mean precision of 1. 5 m was recorded. Where canopy was present, precision ranged between 2. 6 m and 2. 8 m. The {{results indicated that}} in dynamic mode, differences in DGPS performance between canopy cover types were limited to a presence/absence effect. Loss of 3 -dimensional operation (i. e. only 3 satellites in view) occurred more fre-quently than loss of differential correction signal and thus had {{a greater impact on}} recorded precision over the dura-tion of the experiment. It was concluded from the data collected that the most versatile approach when using dynamic DGPS is to collect more (potentially poorer qual-ity) data, rather than to apply a filter at the signal acquisi-tion stage. The observations made, and the conclusions drawn in this paper are relevant to the forest industry in the selection and operation of <b>DGPS</b> <b>equipment</b> for dy-namic tasks where ~ 2 m precision is required...|$|E
40|$|Forest {{fertilization}} had {{its peak}} in the late 60 ´s, when almost 200 000 ha was fertilized annually. The silviculture of today has high demands for timber production {{at the same time}} as the demand for nature conservation increases. It means that it’s necessary to produce more volume in smaller areas in the future. The use of <b>DGPS</b> <b>equipment</b> has in modern forestry in Sweden become more and more common. If the positions of the machine are stored on a regular basis with not too long intervals (up to 30 seconds), it’s possible to digitize the driving paths. This work has been conducted in SCA’s Västerbotten and Jämtland districts and the purpose was to: investigate if the use of digitized strip roads obtained from thinning a few years earlier increases productivity (ha/h) and efficiency (fertilized area per traveled kilometer) in forest fertilization with tractor. The efficiency increased from 4, 42 to 4, 75 fertilized hectares per traveled km for areas were the drivers had access to the digitized strip roads. In areas where drivers felt that they had some help or big help of this information the proportion of fertilized area increased from 74, 9 % to 86, 6 %. Proportion fertilized area is a quota between the fertilized area and the total area of the stand. The drivers themselves argued that they had the greatest advantage of the digitized roads in small stands with easy terrain conditions and in large stands with difficult terrain conditions. The highest recorded increase of efficiency was in large areas with difficult terrain conditions, (+ 22 %) ...|$|E
40|$|The {{integration}} of MMS and LiDAR {{technology is a}} comprehensive solution for generating and managing geometrical and thematic information of roads. The FLI-MAP 400 airborne LiDAR system has extensively been used for surveying and mapping tasks throughout the world. The FLI-MAP system shows advanced capabilities: a pulse frequency of 150, 000 Hz, a multiple (4) return measurement possibility and {{a standard deviation of}} 1. 5 cm. Final products that are extracted from the LiDAR point cloud include 3 D object oriented maps, DTMs, DEMs and orthophotomosaics. The FLI-MAP system allows to accurately map the roads and all the signals, lampposts and other assets along the roads. DAVIDE (Data Acquisition Vehicle and Inertial <b>DGPS</b> <b>Equipment)</b> is a Mobile Mapping System used for generating road databases. The data is collected by integrated and synchronized sensors. The standard configuration includes 3 modules: localization module, video module and road surface module. All data is geo-referenced and is useful for tasks such as maintenance, monitoring, management, analysis and testing of roads resources. DAVIDE has surveyed more than of 20. 000 Km of road in Italy. Further to this, a DAVIDE survey can be adopted in order to capture a wide range of attribute information, referenced still photos and referenced video of the roads and along standing assets. The FLI-MAP products and DAVIDE data are geo-referenced, in Italy to the Gauss-Boaga projection. Both data sources can be combined into a detailed road cadastral system. The integrated data sets can be stored, analyzed, manipulated and visualized in Geographic Information Systems. 1...|$|E
