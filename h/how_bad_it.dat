The American discs feature both the original Swedish dialogue and an English dubbed version, while the European versions feature only the Swedish, and an audio-descriptive track in English. Icons of Fright reported that the American release had been criticized for using new, oversimplified English subtitles instead of the original theatrical subtitles. Following customer complaints, Magnet stated that they would release an updated version with the original theatrical subtitles, but will not exchange current discs. Director Alfredson also expressed his dissatisfaction with the DVD subtitles, calling it a [...] "turkey translation". [...] "If you look on the 'net, people are furious about <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> is done", he added. The UK release retains the theatrical subtitles.|$|E

Britten was later to assert that his initial development as a composer was stifled by reverence for these masters: [...] "Between the ages of thirteen and sixteen I knew every note of Beethoven and Brahms. I remember receiving the full score of Fidelio for my fourteenth birthday... But I think in a sense I never forgave them for having led me astray in my own particular thinking and natural inclinations".

It is widely believed that the hurricane struck without any warning, although some recent historians have disputed this. In his column for The Belize Times on September 5, 2004, Emory King claimed that Belizean authorities withheld continuous warnings from U.S. ships in the region of a possible hurricane strike on British Honduras so the festivities would not be interrupted. King cited as evidence a letter dated September 24, 1931, from a local radio operator to the Colonial Secretary in which the warnings were discussed, adding that [...] "perhaps none of [...] had ever been in a hurricane and didn't know exactly <b>how</b> <b>bad</b> <b>it</b> was going to be."

50|$|According to {{psychologist}} Lola Lopes, while fear {{is indeed}} a crucial factor driving financial markets, majority of investors don't respond that much to greed but to hope. Lopes indicates that fear unlike hope, provokes investors to concentrate on unprofitable invests, while hope does the complete opposite. Furthermore, hope and fear are believed to alter {{the manner in which}} investors estimate other possibilities. Fear provokes investors to ask: <b>How</b> <b>bad</b> can <b>it</b> get?, while hope: How good can it get?. In this case, fear drives investors to enhance security, while hope stimulates investors to emphasise potential.|$|R

It is further argued that the aim of our social and legal treatment of pedophilia should be to minimize harm to children, and that current practice is often counterproductive in this respect.
