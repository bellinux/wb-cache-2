With {{the work of the}} GSC and its associates, the shale was rising to prominence, and in 1975 the Royal Ontario Museum (ROM) obtained permission from the National Parks authority, Parks Canada, to collect fossils from talus material in order to develop its own display. Parks Canada would redirect other museums' requests for material to the ROM, so the 1975 collection team gathered ample specimens to meet the anticipated teaching and <b>display</b> <b>requirements.</b> As well as 7750 specimens, this expedition yielded evidence that further fossil outcrops existed up-slope, and in 1981 a five-year reconnaissance program begun. This program would unearth further sites higher on Fossil Ridge; further around the steep cliffs of Mount Stephen; and on Odaray Mountain. These sites proved very productive, bearing a different fauna and spanning more time than the original beds. Excavation by ROM crews continues to this day, and has found fossils below the base of Walcott's quarry, and some 40km away near the Stanley Glacier. The ROM's collections now stand proud of 140,000 specimens, and is continually yielding important new species and redescriptions. Statistical analysis suggests that new species will continue to be discovered for years to come.|$|E

40|$|In {{multi-user}} multimedia {{information systems}} (e. g., movie-on-demand, digital-editing), scheduling the retrievals of continuous media objects becomes a challenging task. This {{is because of}} both intra and inter object time dependencies. Intra-object time dependency refers to the real-time <b>display</b> <b>requirement</b> of a continuous media object. Inter-object time dependency is the temporal relationships defined among multiple continuous media objects. In order to compose tailored multimedia presentations, a user might define complex time dependencies among multiple continuous media objects having various length and <b>display</b> bandwidth <b>requirement.</b> Scheduling the retrieval tasks corresponding to the components of such a presentation in order to respect both inter and intra task time dependencies {{is the focus of}} this study.
