It became an outdoor education centre in 1971. It continues today as a residential centre, operated since 1996 by Gwent Outdoor Education Service, a joint service supported by the four local authorities of Blaenau Gwent, Monmouthshire, Newport and Torfaen. It caters mainly <b>for</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> college students on organised visits, and hosts activities such as orienteering and archery, with other activities such as canoeing and caving at nearby sites.|$|E
5|$|Despite her predicament, Sánchez {{remained}} relatively positive: she sang to Germán Santa María Barragán, {{a journalist who}} {{was working as a}} volunteer, asked for sweet food, drank soda, and agreed to be interviewed. At times, she was scared, and prayed or cried. On the third night, Sánchez began hallucinating, saying that {{she did not want to}} be late <b>for</b> <b>school,</b> <b>and</b> mentioned a maths exam. Near the end of her life, Sánchez's eyes reddened, her face swelled, and her hands whitened. At one point she asked the people to leave her so they could rest. Hours later the workers returned with a pump and tried to save her, but her legs were bent under the concrete as if she was kneeling, and it was impossible to free her without severing her legs. Lacking the surgical equipment to save her from the effects of an amputation, the doctors present agreed that it would be more humane to let her die. In all, Sánchez suffered for nearly three nights (roughly 60 hours) before she died at approximately 10:05 A.M. on November 16 from exposure, most likely from gangrene or hypothermia.|$|E

25|$|Early Childhood Development (ECD), as {{with primary}} {{education}} and non-formal education programs, {{falls within the}} category of basic education and entails the essential skills of literacy and numeracy upon which further learning is built. Qur'anic education also forms a component of ECD. ECD is offered to children in the 0-5 age bracket, with the focus on stimulating and developing the cognitive, affective and psycho-motor skills of the toddler and his/her holistic development. It also prepares children <b>for</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> facilitates the transition from home to primary school.|$|E
25|$|At that time, he {{was already}} {{receiving}} music lessons at the Academy <b>for</b> <b>School</b> <b>and</b> Church Music. His progress in the field led him to move to Amsterdam in the Netherlands, where he studied voice at Sweelinck Conservatorium with Udo Reinemann, a well-known German baritone. Under the private tutoring of Swedish tenor Gösta Winbergh of the Royal Swedish Opera and French tenor Christian Papis, Urs enriched his classical repertoire. He sang in the choir of the Dutch opera and performed in the Salzburg Festival {{under the direction of}} Claudio Abbado. Before joining Il Divo, he was mainly based in the Netherlands, singing oratorios and performing with the Netherlands Opera Gezelschap (NOG). Despite many performances there are only a handful of recordings available of him before Il Divo.|$|E

McManaman signed as a 16-year-old apprentice upon leaving school in 1988. As an apprentice, McManaman was under the mentoring of John Barnes whom he was being groomed to replace. A natural athlete and cross country champion at school level (once beating Curtis Robb), he developed through the youth scheme at Liverpool and signed as a full professional on 19 February 1990 in what was to be Kenny Dalglish's final full season as manager.|$|E

The regional government has hired more healthcare workers and teachers, with major plans under way <b>for</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> hospital renovations. One {{of the most significant}} new reforms enacted by the incumbent Puntland administration is the launching in May 2009 of the Puntland Agency For Social Welfare (PASWE), the first organization of its kind in Somali history. The agency provides medical, educational and counselling support to vulnerable groups and individuals such as orphans, the disabled and the blind. PASWE is overseen by a Board of Directors, which consists of religious scholars (ulema), business people, intellectuals and traditional elders.|$|E
25|$|Placing {{importance}} on native ecosystems and biodiversity within human landscapes increases human exposure to natural areas, {{which has been}} shown to increase appreciation of nature. Studies have shown that students who participate in outdoor education programs show a greater understanding of their environment, greater willingness to act in order to save the environment, and even a greater enthusiasm <b>for</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> learning. Green spaces have also been shown connect urban dwellers of all ages with nature, even when dominated by invasive species. Reconnecting people with nature is especially important for conservation because there is a tendency for people to use the biodiversity present in the landscape they grew up in as a point of comparison for future trends (see Shifting baseline).|$|E
25|$|The poem {{was rewritten}} from 1790 until 1834 and had six versions, with the 1834 version being the edition that is {{commonly}} {{provided for the}} poem. These were not corrections to the original poem, but instead a development of the themes and ideas along with changes in style, genre, and structure. These changes parallel Coleridge's own changing view of Chatterton. The original version, from 1790, was an imitation of 18th-century poetry written <b>for</b> <b>school</b> <b>and</b> follows the Pindaric ode form that ignores many of the structures of the Pindaric ode. The versions in-between shift to a more Romantic structure and then finally become Augustinian in the final version. As a whole, the poems can be broken into three sets: the 1790 Pindaric ode, the Romantic odes from 1794 until 1829, and the elegy from 1829 until the final publication in 1834.|$|E
