This study was conducted at two different concentrations (1 and 10 μg/L) of 14 C-labeled pirimiphos-methyl for 28 days uptake and 14 days depuration according to the OECD 305 test guideline. The BCFss for total radioactive residues in whole fish were 1, 251 and 1, 277 for low and high concentrations, respectively. The BCFk based on the uptake and <b>depuration</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> were 1, 200 for both low and high concentrations. During the depuration phase, the accumulated test substance was rapidly depurated from fish. Greater than 95 % of the residue at steady-state was depurated after 2 days. Although the measured BCF values were high, pirimiphos-methyl could be evaluated as a low risk from bioaccumulation by aquatic organisms due to the short depuration period and low amount of bound residue (1. 5 %). We suggest that in evaluating bioaccumulation, not only the BCF should be considered, but also depuration time and bound residue in aquatic organisms give {{an indication of the}} potential environmental risks.

40|$|The {{accumulation}} of metals (especially copper) in oysters {{has led to}} green-color now being found in Chinese estuaries. In the present study, the authors quantified the depuration of 8 metals (Ag, Cd, Co, Cr, Cu, Ni, Pb, and Zn) in green-colored oysters (Crassostrea sikamea) collected from an estuary that is heavily contaminated by metals {{as a result of}} industrial effluent releases. The oysters were depurated under laboratory conditions for 4 mo; the accumulated concentrations and the subcellular distribution of metals were measured at different time intervals. Results showed that the green color of oysters faded to light yellow (nearly normal) after 4 mo of depuration. Depuration of metals could be described by a first-order kinetic process. The calculated overall <b>depuration</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> of metals were in the range of 0. 008 d- 1 to 0. 024 d- 1, with a biological retention half-life of 30 d to 70 d. The <b>depuration</b> <b>rates</b> of green-colored contaminated oysters were significantly higher for Cd, Cu, Cr, and Ni than the rates of oysters from a less contaminated site, whereas the <b>depuration</b> <b>rates</b> of Ag, Co, Pb, and Zn were comparable between the 2 populations.

The bivalves were subsequently depurated in the field, and their depuration kinetics, biotransformation and toxin distribution were quantified. Depuration was characterized by a rapid loss within the first day, followed by a secondary slower loss of toxins. In the fast depuration phase, scallops detoxified PSTs more quickly than the mussels (<b>depuration</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> for scallops and mussels were 1. 16 day(- 1) and 0. 87 day(- 1), respectively). In contrast, the mussels detoxified PSTs more quickly than the scallops in the slow depuration phase, and the calculated <b>depuration</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> (mean+SE) from day 2 to day 13 were 0. 063 + 0. 009 day(- 1) and 0. 040 + 0. 019 day(- 1) for mussels and scallops, respectively. The differences in the appearances of gonyautoxins, GTX 2 and GTX 3, and their decarbamoyl derivatives, dcGTX 2, dcGTX 3 and GTX 5, which are all derivatives of C 2 toxin, indicated active and species-specific biotransformation of the algal toxins in the two bivalves.

For highly hydrophobic substances the dietary test is recommended, provided that the test is consistent with the relevant regulatory framework and risk assessment needs [4]. The dietary approach yields both a biomagnification factor (BMF) and an elimination rate constant for the chemical in focus. However, defined regulatory cut-off criteria for the biomagnification potential of chemical compounds are still missing and question the benefit of the BMF approach for the regulatory application. Being able to estimate a BCF from the data generated in the dietary study would meet the regulatory need and justify the use of animals. However, apart from the available <b>depuration</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constant,</b> the calculation of kinetic BCF also requires a corresponding uptake rate constant, which cannot be estimated in dietary bioaccumulation studies.

Uptake of Cd and Zn was higher in U. lactuca than in G, blodgettii, whereas uptake of Cr and Se was comparable between the two species. Only Cd and Zn uptake in U. lactuca was significantly inhibited by dark exposure. A decrease in salinity from 28 to 10 parts per thousand, enhanced the uptake of Cd, Cr, Se and Zn in U. lactuca 1. 9 -, 3. 0 -, 3. 6 -, and 1. 9 -fold, respectively.

Knowledge of physicochemical properties combined with an understanding of physiological processes are important factors for reasonable estimates of elimination.

This would guarantee a BMF <  1 in terrestrial and aquatic food chains for a reasonable, mostly worst-case uptake scenario. It was noted in the plenary discussion that several issues are still up for debate: such as surface-volume ratio of organisms or varying metabolic capacity of different species.

40|$|International audienceIn {{order to}} {{understand}} the bioaccumulation of essential metals in filter-feeding mollusks living in soft sediments, the uptake and depuration kinetics of three elements (Co, Mn and Zn) were investigated in the king scallop Pecten maximus exposed via seawater, food, or sediment, using radiotracer techniques. The scallops were collected in April 2005 in the Pertuis Breton, France and acclimated to laboratory conditions for eight weeks prior to the experimental exposures. Dissolved metals were efficiently bioconcentrated with mean concentration factors (CFs) ranging from 65 (Co) to 94 (Mn) after 7 days of exposure. Feeding experiments using microalgae Skeletonema costatum (diatom) or Isochrysis galbana (flagellate) showed that metal assimilation efficiency (AE) and retention (Tb 1 / 2) were strongly influenced by food source. For Co, AE was higher when ingested with I. galbana (29 vs 4 %), whereas Mn and Zn AE was higher for S. costatum (82 vs 44 % and 86 vs 68 %, respectively). Transfer Factors (TFs) in P. maximus exposed to radiolabelled sediment were 3 to 4 orders of magnitude lower than CFs. Nevertheless, the fraction of sediment-bound metals that was taken up was efficiently absorbed in scallop tissues (> 85 %). Whatever the exposure pathway, metals were strongly retained in the kidneys of P. maximus. Due to poor determination of Mn biokinetics (and related parameters) in scallops exposed through sediment, the relative contribution of the three different pathways could be determined only for Co and Zn using a biodynamic model. The particulate pathway (i. e. food or sediment) appeared to be the main route for bioaccumulation of both metals in this scallop. In addition, even though P. maximus displayed different AEs for Co and Zn according to the food, results of the model were only slightly affected, if any, by change in the dietary parameters (AE and <b>depuration</b> <b>rate</b> <b>constant,</b> ke) ...|$|E

Discharges of U to the aquatic {{environment}} during mining operations may produce measurable increases in U levels that could pose a potential hazard for aquatic organisms. Aqueous U toxicity has been investigated {{in a number of}} aquatic invertebrates, but limited data are available on the effects of U exposure on benthic macroinvertebrates. The objective {{of this study was to}} evaluate the toxicity and accumulation of U over the life cycle of the aquatic invertebrate, Chironomus tentans, and to determine the rates of uptake and depuration for U in C. tentans larvae. Chronic U toxicity was evaluated by exposing the animals to three different U concentrations (40, 200, and 1000 Âµg/L) and an untreated control. Dry weight and U tissue concentration were measured at all life stages and for the exuvia remaining after adult emergence. In addition, some C. tentans adults collected from the treatments were mated with un-exposed adults from an in-house colony to evaluate hatching and mating success. After 10 d of U exposure, C. tentans larvae showed a significant decrease in growth (as dry weight) at mean U concentrations â‰¥ 157 Âµg/L. The no observable effect concentration and lowest observable effect concentration for growth in U exposed C. tentans larvae were 39 and 157 Âµg/L, respectively. Ten-day larval growth retardations correlated strongly with emergence reductions (r 2 = 0. 88) and also led to significant delays in time to adult emergence. Reductions of approximately 30 to 40 % in larval growth corresponded to decreases of 40 to 60 % in adult emergence. This strongly indicates that reductions in C. tentans emergence can be predicted by 10 -d growth data. Furthermore, the effects of U on larval growth were observed not only in the directly exposed F 0 larvae, but also in the unexposed F 1 generation larvae. Therefore, U exposure during the paternal generation can significantly influence the growth and reproductive potential of the next generation. Uranium that accumulated during C. tentans immature stages was partially excreted (approximately 50 %) during metamorphosis to the adult stage. The process of U elimination can be explained both by physiological changes taking place during metamorphosis, as well as by the shedding of the exoskeleton when molting from the pupal to the adult stage. However, the elimination of U was not complete and, as a result, transfer of U to the adult midges was observed. In order to investigate U uptake and depuration, 10 -d old C. tentans larvae were exposed to 300 Âµg U/L.

Linear modeling of adult data demonstrated a decline (P < 0. 001) in average total TTX concentrations over time. Temporal data obtained from a wild population showed similar <b>depuration</b> <b>rates,</b> indicating that once adults reach a certain size, or sexual maturity, TTX is no longer produced or acquired substantially. <b>Depuration</b> <b>rates</b> differed among organs, with concentrations in the heart declining the fastest.

Concentrations of paralytic shellfish toxins (PSTs) in the dosed clams were determined by High Performance Liquid Chromatographic (HPLC) analyses, and the clams were homogenized and then fed to the gastropods (Nassarius festivus). In the toxin accumulation phase, which lasted for 42 days, concentrations of PSTs increased in the snails gradually, reaching a maximum of 1. 10 nmole g(- 1) {{at the end of}} the exposure period. The toxin content of the homogenized clams (food) was 13. 18 nmole g(- 1), which was about 12 -fold higher than the PST content in the snails. Between day 43 and day 82, the snails were fed with non-toxic clams, and this period represented the depuration phase. Accumulation and <b>depuration</b> <b>rates</b> of PSTs in the snails, N. festivus, were determined by fitting the experimental data to user-defined parameters program using a one-compartment model. Two different modeling approaches were used to derive the accumulation and <b>depuration</b> <b>rates.</b> The first approach is to derive both values from the data for the toxin uptake. The second approach is to derive deputation <b>rate</b> from the <b>depuration</b> data and then to derive uptake rate, allowing for toxin depuration, from the data for toxin uptake. The first approach yielded more consistent results for the toxin concentration {{at the end of the}} uptake period, when compared with the experimental data. The toxin uptake and <b>depuration</b> <b>rates</b> were 1. 64 (pmole of toxin into snail per day) per (nmole g(- 1) of toxin in food) and 0. 06 +/- 0. 02 day(- 1) (mean +/- SE), respectively. The toxin profiles of snails were similar to the clams, but different from the algae. Besides C toxins (C 1 and C 2), dcGTX 2 and dcGTX 3 were also detected in both clams and snails. The beta:alpha epimer ratio gradually decreased during trophic transfer and approached a ratio of 1 : 3 (26. 4 mol%: 73. 6 mol% at day 42) in the snails, near the end of the accumulation period.

In this contribution we investigate the influence of pectin properties (degree and pattern of methoxylation) and processing conditions (pH 2. 0, 3. 0, 5. 0 and 7. 0; temperatures of 80 up to 110 degrees C) on pectin degradation <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> Pectins with different degrees and patterns of methoxylation were prepared and heated. the extent of acid hydrolysis, P-elimination and demethoxylation was assayed as a function of treatment time. As the degree of methoxylation and pH decreased, beta-elimination <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> decreased while acid hydrolysis <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> increased. Demethoxylation <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> were minimal at pH 3. 0 and increased both at lower and higher pH. Reaction <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> were not considerably influenced by the pattern of methoxylation. All reaction <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> increased with increasing temperature. As P-elimination rates are reduced by competing demethoxylation, both <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> were compared. The ratio of these reaction <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> showed no trend with pH. However, an increase in degree of methoxylation or temperature resulted in a more pronounced increase in P-elimination <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> than in demethoxylation <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> (c) 2007 Elsevier Ltd.

Therefore, the exponential curve of the degradation RhB under visible-light irradiation was fitted in Fig.  8 b, and the degradation kinetics of RhB was described by the first-order kinetics curves. Degradation experiments followed the first-order kinetic equation ln(C 0 -C)[*]=[*]−[*]Kt[*]+[*]b (in which K is the apparent first-order <b>rate</b> <b>constant</b> and t is the reaction time).

40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{a theory of}} the kinetic analysis of patch-clamp data. We assume that channel gating is a Markov process that can be described by a model consisting of n kinetic states and n(n - 1) <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> at each voltage, and that patch-clamp data describe the occupancy of x different conductance levels over time. In general, all the kinetic information {{in a set of}} patch-clamp data is found in either two-dimensional dwell time histograms describing the frequency of observation of sequential dwell times of durations tau 1 and tau 2 (Fredkin, D. R., M. Montal, and J. A. Rice, 1985, Proceedings of the Berkeley Conference in Honor of Jerzy Neyman and Jack Kiefer, vol. 1, 269 - 289) or in three-point joint probability functions describing the probability that a channel is in a given conductance at time t, and at time t + tau 1, and at time t + tau 1 + tau 2. For the special case of channels with a single open state plus multiple closed states, one-dimensional analyses provide all of the kinetic information. Stationary patch-clamp data have information {{that can be used to}} determine H <b>rate</b> <b>constants,</b> where H = n(n - 1) - G and G is the number of intraconductance <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> Thus, to calculate H <b>rate</b> <b>constants,</b> G <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> must be fixed. In general there are multiple sets of G <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> that can be fixed to allow the calculation of H <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> although not every set of G <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> will work. Arbitrary assignment of the G intraconductance <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> equal to zero always provides a solution and the calculation of H <b>rate</b> <b>constants.</b> Nonstationary patch-clamp data have information for the determination of H <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> at a reference voltage plus n(n - 1) <b>rate</b> <b>constants</b> at all test voltages.
