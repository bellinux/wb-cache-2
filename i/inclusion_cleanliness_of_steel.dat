40|$|Key words: 38 CrMoAl steel; {{refining}} slag; mold powder; tundish powder; cleanliness. Abstract. Nozzle blockage {{is easy to}} {{take place}} in continuous casting process when producing 38 CrMoAl steel due to high content of aluminum ([Al]= 0. 7 %~ 1. 1 %). Slag-steel reaction will lead to large transformation for composition <b>of</b> molten <b>steel</b> and performance <b>of</b> slag on the condition of traditional high content of SiO 2 in slag. And it will reduce the <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> as well. The control target of refining slag and tundish powder has been gotten through the analysis of refining & continuous casting characteristics <b>of</b> high aluminum <b>steel.</b> Based on this, the content of Si and Al in molten steel can be controlled accurately, and the <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> has gone to a higher level. Moreover, mold powder with high basicity and vitrification ensures the stability of slag after sorbing Al 2 O 3 inclusions in theory. Continuous casting can be carried out successfully with the control of inclusion morphology through slag washing during tapping. Industrial practice shows that Si content is 0. 25 %~ 0. 40 %, Al content is 0. 80 %~ 1. 00 %, S content is below 0. 004 % and T[O] is below 0. 0015 % in steel products. Moreover, casting bloom with good surface quality is achieved, and the rate of bloom without cleaning is as high as 100 %. With all these countermeasures, 38 CrMoAl steel can be continuously cast for more than 6 heats...|$|R

40|$|The <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> {{with respect}} to {{non-metallic}} inclusions and the precise alloy compositions in the steel products have always been of great concern in steel making technology. The development <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> making process to meet the compositional requirements for specific mechanical properties such as ductility, toughness, fatigue and machinability requires dynamic and continuous investigations. The refining <b>of</b> molten <b>steel</b> in the ladle furnace to meet the required compositional range requires the optimisation of the process parameters. For sulphur removal control, parameters such as argon gas flow rate through the porous plugs, inductive stirring effect, vacuum pressure of the tank degasser, amount & composition of the top slag should be optimised. In this thesis project an investigation was carried out on {{the factors that influence}} the top slag composition before vacuum treatment and also to optimise the top slag composition for precise sulphur removal. 12 heats were followed during the project: slag samples, steel samples, temperature and oxygen activities were taken at eight different process stages at Ovako steel mill. A relatively large variation was observed for all the oxide components of the slag phase before vacuum treatment in all the heats followed. A PLS analysis made shows that topslag composition before degassing is influenced by the amount of slag former added, oxygen potential at tapping, the yield of Al and Si deoxidants into the steel at tapping. The model has a poor predictability because some important parameters such as ladle glaze condition, amount of EAF slag tapped and refractory wear could not be measured. An alternative solution of extra slag practice was suggested instead of modelling the composition and mass of carry over slag left after slag removal. The extra slag practice involves the addition of lime during tapping so as to aid the removal of all the slag before ladle refining and thus optimisation of the new synthetic slag for precise sulphur removal could be easily achieved. Finally the investigation of the desulphurisation process shows that degassing time, argon gas flow rate through the porous plugs are as well important as the slag mass and composition in order to achieve a precise sulphur removal.

40|$|AbstractHigh end {{applications}} {{often require}} high strength materials especially regarding the fatigue limit. It {{is still an}} open question what the highest fatigue limits are and how to increase them further in high strength steels. A thermomechanical treatment (TMT) in the temperature range of maximal dynamic strain ageing is an auspicious way to increase the fatigue limit <b>of</b> bearing <b>steel</b> SAE 52100. Successful attempts have been published for various materials states. The present investigation deals with the influence of non-metallic inclusions on the fatigue limit and the possibility to increase the fatigue limit by TMT. The fatigue limit <b>of</b> high strength <b>steels</b> increases by reducing {{the size of the}} non-metallic inclusions during steelmaking. We found that TMT increases the fatigue limit of a high strength materials state only in cases in which the non-metallic inclusions are the starting points of the fatigue cracks. In the case <b>of</b> high <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> the origin <b>of</b> the fatigue cracks may be at any position in the matrix.

40|$|The {{possibilities}} of obtaining a {{good process control}} {{in order to reach}} a good <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> were studied based on plant trials. Steel and slag samples were taken from two steel grades with a slightly different composition, but with similar processing conditions. Thereafter, the chemical compositions <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> and slag samples were determined. The results show that the sum of the FeO and MnO was found to be a clear indicator for when reoxidation had taken place. No conclusive indicator was found to predict the extent of slag carry-over from the electric arc furnace. However, most of the variation in deoxidation seem to originate from the accuracy of the slag raking. Steel grades with low amounts of deoxidisers such as C and Si naturally were found to result in higher oxygen contents at the start of deoxidation. Furthermore, calculations of oxygen activities in the steel melt were made and the results were compared to measurements with varying results. Overall, the results indicate that calculation of oxygen activities with multivalence slag species such as Fe and Cr requires additional measurements to obtain accurate results.

40|$|Summary: Shattered {{rim wheel}} failures, {{although}} relatively rare in North American railway freight service, remain {{a major concern}} for railways and wheel manufacturers since such failures can occur under a train at high speed, and can result in dangerous, expensive derailments. Shattered rim fatigue cracks typically initiate and grow {{at a depth of}} 12 to 20 mm (1 / 2 to 3 / 4 inches) below the wheel tread surface. To help further reduce the incidence of these wheel failures, the Association of American Railroads (AAR) recently adopted a wheel steel microcleanliness specification based upon ASTM E 1245. A major North American railroad has used this microcleanliness evaluation method, which involves using quantitative image analysis techniques to analyze six polished metallographic samples removed from the wheel rim, for several years. Alternative effective methods of microcleanliness evaluation, which could be performed faster in-house, would be desirable from a wheel manufacturing point of view. This paper discusses the use of two alternative microcleanliness measurement methods, phased array ultrasonic testing and the Spark-Dat system, to determine the <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> wheel <b>steel</b> samples.

It becomes obvious that the contamination of the bearing with foreign particles leads to a drastic reduction in bearing life. Furthermore, it demonstrates the impact of the bearing lubrication and coating as well as the effect of additives on the attainable life and wear. Further fundamentals of rolling element bearing design are the materials, the material cleanliness and the heat treatment.

40|$|To stay {{competitive}} in the steel industry, steelmakers are utilizing different production methods to reduce production cost without compromising {{on the quality of}} their products. In steelmaking, the production process plays a significant role on the steel cleanliness. Recent increasing demands on the cleanliness level therefore require optimization of production process to meet the requirement. Often, the types and distribution of non-metallic inclusions in steel determines the steel cleanliness. In order to optimize the production process, complete assessment of the non-metallic inclusions in the steel is necessary, leading to implementation of measures to control and/or remove non-metallic inclusions in the steel. The present study was performed to investigate the <b>cleanliness</b> level <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> bars produced from a high frequency induction furnace (HF) route at Uddeholms AB. Experimental studies were carried out and characteristics such as number, composition, size distribution and morphology of non-metallic inclusions were investigated. Total oxygen and total nitrogen content were also measured for indirect assessment. Further, the production operations at the HF were observed and evaluated to determine their influence on the inclusion characteristics. The characteristics obtained were compared with characteristics <b>of</b> inclusions in <b>steel</b> bars produced from an electric arc furnace production (EAF) route at Uddeholms AB and a competitor producer sample. The results showed that the level <b>of</b> <b>cleanliness</b> varies from different production routes and is hence dependent on the process at each production route. The number, maximum and mean size of inclusions were found to be higher in the HF route compared to the other routes. More so, there were differences in the types of oxide inclusions observed from each process route. However, sulphide inclusions exhibit similar characteristics from the different process routes. Further, the compositions of oxide inclusions observed from the HF route were found to be closely related to the steel chemistry. More importantly, the types of inclusions formed in the HF route were found to be sensitively affected by the extent of aluminium and calcium contents in the steel. Thus, the oxide inclusion types in the HF samples could be traced to the extent of different additions and operations such as deoxidation and calcium treatment that were carried out during the steelmaking process...|$|R
40|$|The {{objective}} {{of this study was}} to develop the Automated Steel Cleanliness Analysis Tool (ASCATTM) to permit steelmakers to evaluate the quality <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> through the analysis of individual inclusions. By characterizing individual inclusions, determinations can be made as to the <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> the <b>steel.</b> Understanding the complicating effects of inclusions in the steelmaking process and on the resulting properties <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> allows the steel producer to increase throughput, better control the process, reduce remelts, and improve the quality of the product. The ASCAT (Figure 1) is a steel-smart inclusion analysis tool developed around a customized next-generation computer controlled scanning electron microscopy (NG-CCSEM) hardware platform that permits acquisition of inclusion size and composition data at a rate never before possible in SEM-based instruments. With built-in customized ''intelligent'' software, the inclusion data is automatically sorted into clusters representing different inclusion types to define the characteristics of a particular heat (Figure 2). The ASCAT represents an innovative new tool for the collection of statistically meaningful data on inclusions, and provides a means of understanding the complicated effects of inclusions in the steel making process and on the resulting properties <b>of</b> <b>steel.</b> Research conducted by RJLG with AISI (American Iron and Steel Institute) and SMA (<b>Steel</b> Manufactures <b>of</b> America) members indicates that the ASCAT has application in high-grade bar, sheet, plate, tin products, pipes, SBQ, tire cord, welding rod, and specialty steels and alloys where control of inclusions, whether natural or engineered, are crucial to their specification for a given end-use. Example applications include castability of calcium treated steel; interstitial free (IF) degasser grade slag conditioning practice; tundish clogging and erosion minimization; degasser circulation and optimization; quality assessment/steel cleanliness; slab, billet or bloom disposition; and alloy development. Additional benefits of ASCAT include the identification of inclusions that tend to clog nozzles or interact with refractory materials. Several papers outlining the benefits of the ASCAT have been presented and published in the literature. The paper entitled ''Inclusion Analysis to Predict Casting Behavior'' was awarded the American Iron and Steel Institute (AISI) Medal in 2004 for special merit and importance to the steel industry. The ASCAT represents a quantum leap in inclusion analysis and will allow steel producers to evaluate the quality <b>of</b> <b>steel</b> and implement appropriate process improvements. In terms of performance, the ASCAT (1) allows for accurate classification of inclusions by chemistry and morphological parameters, (2) can characterize hundreds of inclusions within minutes, (3) is easy to use (does not require experts), (4) is robust, and (5) has excellent image quality for conventional SEM investigations (e. g., the ASCAT can be utilized as a dual use instrument). In summary, the ASCAT will significantly advance the tools of the industry and addresses an urgent and broadly recognized need <b>of</b> the <b>steel</b> industry.

40|$|A {{fracture}} mechanics interpretation of rolling bearing fatigue MWJ Lewis 1 and B Tomkins 2 In fatigue assessment of structures and components, {{it is now}} commonplace to use a defect-tolerant approach {{to account for the}} inevitable presence of surface and internal flaws, both detectable and undetectable. This approach has been applied to rolling bearings in an attempt to present contact stress limits as a function of defect size below which fatigue failure would not be expected. In essence, it is an extension to the existing rating life methods developed by Ioannides and Harris that incorporate a fatigue limit stress in the estimation of bearing life, a concept {{similar to that of the}} endurance limit in structural fatigue. Such a {{fracture mechanics}} approach to sub-surface initiated fatigue in rolling bearing steels containing non-metallic inclusions, based upon the work of Murakami, has led to an allowable contact stress limit as a function of maximum inclusion size (as estimated by extreme value analysis). An alternative, less conservative fracture mechanics based stress limit is the prevention of propagation of cracks formed on inclusions (termed ‘butterflies’) by shear (Mode II) loading. The approach has been developed by examination of butterflies formed in service in rolling element bearings manufactured in bainitic steel with maximum inclusion sizes in excess of 100 mm. The observed lack of micro-crack formation on inclusions and non-propagation of butterflies support the concept of a fatigue endurance limit that is related to the <b>cleanliness</b> <b>of</b> the bearing <b>steel...</b>|$|R
