25|$|A {{great many}} individuals, {{ever since the}} rise of the {{mathematical}} method, have, each for himself, attacked its direct and indirect consequences. I shall call each of these persons a paradoxer, and his system a paradox. <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> word in the old sense: a paradox is something which is apart from general opinion, either in subject matter, method, or conclusion. Many of the things brought forward would now be called crotchets, which is the nearest word we have to old paradox. But there is this difference, that by calling a thing a crotchet we mean to speak lightly of it; which was not the necessary sense of paradox. Thus in the 16th century many spoke of the earth's motion as the paradox of Copernicus and held the ingenuity of that theory in very high esteem, and some I think who even inclined towards it. In the seventeenth century the deprivation of meaning took place, in England at least.|$|E

500|$|The Spectators {{literary}} reviewer, Anita Brookner, {{based on}} her reading of the novel in the original French, described the book as a [...] "masterly novel...diabolically (and <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> word advisedly) clever. It is also impressive, not merely {{as an act of}} impersonation but perhaps above all for the fiendish diligence with which it is carried out...presuppose(s) formidable research {{on the part of the}} author, who is American, educated in France and writing fluent, idiomatic and purposeful French. This tour de force, which not everyone will welcome, outclasses all other fictions and will continue to do so for some time to come. No summary can do it justice." [...] The Observer 's Paris correspondent, Jason Burke, praised the book as an [...] "extraordinary Holocaust novel asks what it is that turns normal people into mass killers," [...] adding that [...] "notwithstanding the controversial subject matter, this is an extraordinarily powerful novel." ...|$|E

2500|$|In the mid-1920s, {{disappointed}} by the Western cultural elite's reaction to his political manifestos, Merezhkovsky returned to religious and philosophical essays, but in the new format, that of a monumental free-form experimental-styled treatise. Some of his new books were biographies, some just extensive, amorphous researches in ancient history. Speaking {{of the first two}} of them, The Birth of Gods. Tutankhamen in Crete (1925) and Messiah (1928), Merezhkovsky thus explained his credo: [...] "Many people think I am a historical novelist, which is wrong. What <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Past for is only searching for the Future. The Present is a kind of exile to me. My true home is the Past/Future, which is where I belong." ...|$|E

I don't mean to suggest that I have any feelings {{one way or the}} other about it...I don't know what the Method is and I don't care what the Method is. Everybody's got a method. Everybody can't articulate about their method, and I can't, if I have a method—and Jane sometimes says that <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> Method, that is, the capital letter Method, without being aware of it. Maybe I do; it doesn't matter." ...|$|E

2500|$|As the {{emergence}} of rock 'n roll music began in the 1950s, Williams left no doubt as to where {{he stood on the}} subject: against. [...] "Most of it's so bad it's embarrassing," [...] he said. [...] "In the days of the big bands, a vocalist {{had to be able to}} sing....I believe teenagers are hungry to hear good music, and at some point we must assume a lot of the blame for the quality of what is being heard. <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> word 'we' to mean disc jockeys and radio stations in general." [...] A well-known advertisement of the era showed Williams holding his nose under the caption [...] "We asked William B. Williams of WNEW Radio what he thought of rock 'n' roll." [...] Still, beginning in the late 1950s, WNEW began mixing in softer tunes from rock artists, which continued into the 1960s. While WNEW was still playing pop standards, soft rock was a big part of the format, making them a MOR station. Williams hated most of these songs, but played them when he had to.|$|E

He also said that after the match, Vince McMahon thanked him for all he had done for the company, but made Foley promise to [...] "never {{do anything like that}} again." [...] He also made mention in the book of a rather humorous exchange he and Undertaker had while being checked out more thoroughly by Petit in the backstage area. Foley, still somewhat dazed from the concussion he sustained, turned to The Undertaker and asked, [...] "Did <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> thumbtacks?", which was a staple of a number of Foley's early matches. The Undertaker looked at him and rather sternly replied, [...] "Look at your arm, Mick!", at which point Foley discovered a significant number of thumbtacks still lodged in his arm.

2500|$|Jerome's {{earliest}} {{efforts in}} translation, his {{revision of the}} four Gospels, was dedicated to Damasus; but following Damasus's death Jerome's versions {{had little or no}} official recognition. Jerome's translated texts had to make their way on their own merits. The Old Latin versions continued to be copied and used alongside the Vulgate versions. Commentators such as Isidore of Seville and Gregory the Great (Pope from 590 to 604) recognised the superiority of the new version, and promoted it in their works; but the old tended to continue in liturgical use, especially in the Psalter and the biblical Canticles. In the prologue to Moralia in Job, Gregory the Great writes: [...] "I comment on the new translation. But when argumentation is necessary, <b>I</b> <b>use</b> <b>the</b> evidence sometimes of the new translation, sometimes of the old one, since the Apostolic See, over which by God's grace I preside, uses both". This distinction of [...] "new translation" [...] and [...] "old translation" [...] is regularly found in commentators until the 8th century; but it remained uncertain for those books that had not been revised by Jerome (the New Testament outside the Gospels, and certain of the deuterocanonical books), which versions of the text belonged to the [...] "new" [...] translation and which to the [...] "old". The earliest Bible manuscript where all books are included in the versions that would later be recognised as [...] "Vulgate" [...] is the 8th century Codex Amiatinus; but as late as the 12th century, the Vulgate Codex Gigas retained an Old Latin text for the Apocalypse and the Acts of the Apostles.|$|E
