Similar to the running divisions, a set of qualifying times has been developed for these divisions to motivate aspiring athletes and ensure competitive excellence.

More than 1,000 people with disabilities and impairments have participated <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheelchair</b> division, while the other divisions have gained popularity each year. In 2013, 40 blind runners participated.|$|E
25|$|The man <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheelchair</b> says he too {{once had}} the support of a woman “to get me out of the chair in the evening and back into it again in the morning and to push me as far as the corner when I went out of my mind.” He also had a son, Billy, and begins calling the blind man by that name. He proposes the two of them join forces to unite sight and {{mobility}} in the interests of survival. The blind man is tempted by the other’s offer to locate some tinned food. The prospect of chancing across some “baked beans” especially excites him.|$|E

500|$|He {{also saw}} the book as being [...] "a sort of flashback" [...] for Hergé, {{allowing}} him to relive events from his own past; thus, Peeters thought that the constant renovations at Marlinspike represented the constant renovations at Hergé's country home of Céroux-Mousty, while Haddock's time <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheelchair</b> represented his former wife's Germaine time spent similarly disabled, and Castafiore was a parody of Germaine herself. Ultimately, {{he felt that the}} story– [...] "the last great adventure of Tintin"– was [...] "also a swan song", for Hergé [...] "did not dare to continue down this path, where not all of his readers had followed him", and which had represented [...] "a permanent loss of innocence." ...|$|E
500|$|James Cameron {{has said}} that he [...] "tried to make a film that would touch people's spirituality across the broad spectrum." [...] He also stated that one of the film's {{philosophical}} underpinnings is that [...] "the Na'vi represent that sort of aspirational part of ourselves that wants to be better, that wants to respect nature, while the humans in the film represent the more venal versions of ourselves, the banality of evil that comes with corporate decisions that are made out of remove of the consequences." [...] Film director John Boorman saw a similar dichotomy as a key factor contributing to its success: [...] "Perhaps the key is the marine <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheelchair.</b> [...] He is disabled, but Mr Cameron and technology can transport him into the body of a beautiful, athletic, sexual, being. [...] After all, we are all disabled in one way or another; inadequate, old, broken, earthbound. [...] Pandora is a kind of heaven where we can be resurrected and connected instead of disconnected and alone." ...|$|E
500|$|This episode {{featured}} guest appearances by actors Paul Reubens and Isabella Rossellini.

Fey, in regard to Reubens, said: [...] "We were thrilled beyond belief to get him to do [...]" [...] Kevin Lasit, the show's prop master, built Gerhardt's wheelchair and puppet legs. Fey said that Lasit [...] "really outdid himself", and noted that Reubens was kneeling <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>wheelchair</b> in the seat built over the top of him. In addition, Reubens wore prosthetic teeth and a wig to accommodate his character's look. According to Fey, in the DVD commentary for this episode, the show shot an alternate endingat Reubens's requestin which Gerhardt does not die, [...] "but ultimately it felt better stakes for the story if he'd die", in which Will Forte's character says, [...] "The Habsburg line has ended. You can pick up your gift bags at the coat check." [...] In [...] "Black Tie", Rosellini played Bianca, the ex-wife of Alec Baldwin's character, Jack Donaghy. Rosellini would make a second appearance in the February 8, 2007, episode [...] "Up All Night".
