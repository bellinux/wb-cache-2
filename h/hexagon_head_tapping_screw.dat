Die factories do not reveal their screw threading die design techniques, so production and maintenance processes are established by trial-and-error or worker experience and passing down such techniques and documenting quality control is difficult. In this study, screw thread forming design and process analysis were carried out by combining computer-aided design software with computer-aided metal forming analysis software. Simulation results were verified in an actual forming process. The sheet metal <b>tapping</b> <b>screw</b> forging size error was less than 0. 90 %, except at a sharp angle, which was associated with an error of 3. 075 %, thereby demonstrating {{the accuracy of the}} simulated forming process.

This study is the initial step {{in the development of}} a basic skills simulator for surgical residents, intended to serve as a cross-platform objective motor skills training system. A robust system was developed to measure motor skills of orthopaedic surgeons and gynecologic surgeons. The orthopaedic study focused on three basic skills: drill, <b>tap,</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion. Each of the participants repeated the sequential task of drill, <b>tap,</b> <b>screw</b> insertion ten times in cadaveric femoral diaphyseal bone. The gynecologic study focused on placement of sutures across ten incisions in synthetic skin. Real time wrist, hand, and finger position was recorded bilaterally using Immersion CyberGloves® and the Ascension Liberty Tracker®. Four metrics were evaluated: task duration, gesture proficiency, hand movement smoothness (replaced by subjective rating in Gyn study), and number of errors, in order to differentiate between groups with different skill levels: No Skills, Limited Skills, Advanced Skills, and Expert Skills. The results demonstrated a significant difference between the Expert Skills group and the less skilled groups. In both studies the Expert Skills group completed the tasks the fastest, with the greatest proficiency, smoothness and accuracy. These results establish the 5 capability of our present skill quantification system and will assist in future improvement of the analysis algorithm...|$|R

40|$|This is {{an article}} from the journal, Proceedings of the Institution of Mechanical Engineers, Part H: Journal of Engineering in Medicine [© IMechE]. It is also {{available}} at: [URL] use of power screwdrivers and drills for <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion in surgery is becoming more common. It has been established from clinical observations {{that the use of}} a small air drill for inserting self-tapping screws provides improved coaxial alignment and precision, and that the drill should be stopped before the screw head is completely seated on the plate, presumably {{to reduce the risk of}} over-tightening. The risk of overrun and over-tightening during <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion is increased with the use of power tools. Prevention of over-tightening is dependent upon when the surgeon detects the onset of tightening, both visually and from the feel of the rapid increase in torque. If detection is too late, then over-tightening or stripping can occur. This study is concerned with using a mechatronic screwdriver to control the tapping depth and to prevent the over-tightening of screws. The effects of various parameters upon the torque profile during <b>tapping</b> and <b>screw</b> insertion have been investigated in synthetic bone and sheep tibia. An automated system is proposed for preventing over-tightening of pre-tapped and self-tapping screws when attaching a surgical plate to a sheep tibia in vitro. The system was used to attach a plate to a sheep tibia using self-tapping screws. The mean torque of the screws inserted using the automated system was 35 per cent of the stripping torque...|$|R

40|$|The metal {{injection}} moulding technique (MIM) is already established for serial production of complex, mostly stainless steel parts.

Facing the challenge of obtaining suitable medical titanium MIM parts, advances have been made at Fraunhofer IFAM over the last few years. Investigations show the effect of very fine powders and different surface finishes of the mould: with polished moulds a very low surface roughness of less than 0. 8 m of the sintered part was obtainable. Chemical and mechanical properties of the sintered parts show the complexity of interactions between sintering conditions, purity, particle size and binder components. Additionally tests concerning feasibility of moulding high aspect ratios, wall-thicknesses of less than 200 m and special features like a fine internal thread and <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> set structures were performed as well...|$|R

40|$|Abstract Background In {{the present}} biomechanical study, the {{torsional}} stability of different interference screws, made of bovine bone, was tested. Interference screws derived from bovine bone are a possible biological alternative to conventional metallic or bioabsorbable polymer interference screws. Methods In {{the first part}} of the study we compared the torsional stability of self-made 8 mm Interference screws (BC) and a commercial 8 mm interference screw (Tutofix ®). Furthermore, we compared the torsional strength of BC screws with different diameters. For screwing in, a <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> and an octagon head were tested. Maximum breaking torques in polymethyl methacrylate resin were recorded by means of an electronic torque screw driver. In the second part of the study the tibial part of a bone-patellar tendon-bone graft was fixed in porcine test specimens using an 8 mm BC screw and the maximum insertion torques were recorded. Each interference screw type was tested 5 times. Results There was no statistically significant difference between the different 8 mm interference screws (p = 0. 121). Pairwise comparisons did not reveal statistically significant differences, either. It was demonstrated for the BC screws, that a larger screw diameter significantly leads to higher torsional stability (p = 9. 779 × 10 - 5). Pairwise comparisons showed a significantly lower torsional stability for the 7 mm BC screw than for the 8 mm BC screw (p = 0. 0079) and the 9 mm BC screw (p = 0. 0079). Statistically significant differences between the 8 mm and the 9 mm BC screw could not be found (p = 0. 15). During screwing into the tibial graft channel of the porcine specimens, insertion torques between 0. 5 Nm and 3. 2 Nm were recorded. In one case the <b>hexagon</b> <b>head</b> of a BC screw broke off during the last turn. Conclusions The BC screws show comparable torsional stability to Tutofix ® interference screws. As expected the torsional strength of the screws increases significantly with the diameter. The safety and in vivo performance of products derived from xenogeneic bone should be the focus of further investigations. </p...|$|R

The study is based on the concept that the load bearing capacity of the composite wall is derived from the individual components, namely the profiled steel sheeting, dry board and the interaction between these two. Therefore, an analytical method is essential to predict the behaviour of the PSSDB system as walling unit with window opening. A linear finite element model has been developed to predict the full range of behaviour of PSSDB panel. LUSAS (1999), a finite element package (LUSAS version 13. 4) has been employed for this purpose. LUSAS pre-processing options provide on-screen modelling which include wide range of features like colour plots of deflection, stress and strain contours combining with different load cases...|$|R

The PSSDB is a light weight composite panel comprised of a profiled steel sheet PSS and cement board as dry board connected together by either mechanical fasteners or by epoxy adhesive resin. Ten push-out specimens with different size, shape, thickness of dry board, and types of connections were carried out. The ultimate load, the load slip relationship, and modes of failure were observed. The results showed that the samples connected by epoxy adhesive resin can sustain load greater than that connected by mechanical fasteners up to 76 %, and the ultimate load affected by the thickness of dry board. The capacity of connecter (self drilling-self <b>tapping</b> <b>screw</b> with 4. 2 mm diameter) is about 1. 736 kN/screw. This value increased by about 20 % with the increase in dryboard thickness to double (from 8 mm to 16 mm). The Ultimate load sustained by the specimens connected by using epoxy adhesive resin is about 37 kN/m and 137 kN/m for the DB connected to ribs and trough sides of PSS, respectively.
