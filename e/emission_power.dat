50|$|Above {{infrared}} {{in frequency}} comes visible light. The Sun emits its peak {{power in the}} visible region, although integrating the entire <b>emission</b> <b>power</b> spectrum through all wavelengths shows that the Sun emits slightly more infrared than visible light. By definition, visible light {{is the part of}} the EM spectrum the human eye is the most sensitive to. Visible light (and near-infrared light) is typically absorbed and emitted by electrons in molecules and atoms that move from one energy level to another. This action allows the chemical mechanisms that underlie human vision and plant photosynthesis. The light that excites the human visual system is a very small portion of the electromagnetic spectrum. A rainbow shows the optical (visible) part of the electromagnetic spectrum; infrared (if it could be seen) would be located just beyond the red side of the rainbow with ultraviolet appearing just beyond the violet end.|$|E

50|$|Multi-color LEDs offer {{not merely}} another means to form white light {{but a new}} means to form light of {{different}} colors. Most perceivable colors can be formed by mixing different amounts of three primary colors. This allows precise dynamic color control. As more effort is devoted to investigating this method, multi-color LEDs should have profound influence on the fundamental method that we use to produce and control light color. However, before this type of LED {{can play a role}} on the market, several technical problems must be solved. These include that this type of LED's <b>emission</b> <b>power</b> decays exponentially with rising temperature,resulting in a substantial change in color stability. Such problems inhibit and may preclude industrial use. Thus, many new package designs aimed at solving this problem have been proposed and their results are now being reproduced by researchers and scientists. However multi-colour LEDs without phosphors can never provide good quality lighting because each LED is a narrow band source (see graph). LEDs without phosphor while a poorer solution for general lighting are the best solution for displays, either backlight of LCD, or direct LED based pixels.|$|E
