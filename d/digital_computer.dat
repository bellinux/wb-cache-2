5|$|The {{seeds of}} modern AI were planted by {{classical}} philosophers {{who attempted to}} describe the process of human thinking as the mechanical manipulation of symbols. This work culminated in {{the invention of the}} programmable <b>digital</b> <b>computer</b> in the 1940s, a machine based on the abstract essence of mathematical reasoning. This device and the ideas behind it inspired a handful of scientists to begin seriously discussing the possibility of building an electronic brain.|$|E
5|$|Blaise Pascal {{invented the}} {{mechanical}} calculator in 1642; {{it was the}} first operational adding machine. It made use of a gravity-assisted carry mechanism. It was the only operational mechanical calculator in the 17thcentury and the earliest automatic, <b>digital</b> <b>computer.</b> Pascal's calculator was limited by its carry mechanism, which forced its wheels to only turn one way so it could add. To subtract, the operator had to use the Pascal's calculator's complement, which required as many steps as an addition. Giovanni Poleni followed Pascal, building the second functional mechanical calculator in 1709, a calculating clock made of wood that, once setup, could multiply two numbers automatically.|$|E

5|$|Ed Roberts' {{interest}} in computers began {{in high school}} when he built a simple <b>digital</b> <b>computer</b> from relays. His first real experience with computers came while at Oklahoma State University where engineering students had free access to an IBM 1620 computer. Roberts' office at Weapons Laboratory had {{the state of the}} art Hewlett-Packard 9100A programmable calculator in 1968. In July 1970, a semiconductor company, Electronic Arrays, announced a set of six LSI ICs that would make a four-function calculator. Roberts was determined to design a calculator kit.|$|E
5|$|Bletchley Park is {{a former}} private estate located in Old Bletchley and modern Museum of Cryptography. Conveniently located at the {{junction}} of the Varsity Line with the West Coast Main Line, Bletchley Park, code-named Station X, was {{the location of the}} Allied main code-breaking establishment during World War II. Codes and ciphers of several Axis powers were deciphered there, most famously the German Enigma. Colossus, the world's first programmable electronic <b>digital</b> <b>computer</b> was put to work here as part of the codebreaking effort. The high-level intelligence produced by Bletchley Park, codenamed Ultra, is frequently credited with aiding the Allied war effort and shortening the war, although Ultra's effect on the actual outcome of World War II is debated.|$|E
5|$|For use in {{a binary}} <b>digital</b> <b>computer,</b> the tube had {{to be capable of}} storing either one of two states at each of its memory locations, {{corresponding}} to the binary digits (bits) 0 and1. It exploited the positive or negative electrostatic charge generated by displaying either a dash or a dot at any position on the CRT screen, a phenomenon known as secondary emission. A dash generated a positive charge, and a dot a negative charge, either of which could be picked up by a detector plate in front of the screen; a negative charge represented 0, and a positive charge1. The charge dissipated in about 0.2seconds, but it could be automatically refreshed from the data picked up by the detector.|$|E

50|$|Several {{examples}} of analog computation survived into recent times. A planimeter is a device which does integrals, using distance as the analog quantity. Until the 1980s, HVAC systems used air both as the analog quantity and the controlling element. Unlike modern <b>digital</b> <b>computers,</b> analog computers {{are not very}} flexible, {{and need to be}} reconfigured (i.e., reprogrammed) manually to switch them from working on one problem to another. Analog computers had an advantage over early <b>digital</b> <b>computers</b> in that they could be used to solve complex problems using behavioral analogues while the earliest attempts at <b>digital</b> <b>computers</b> were quite limited.|$|R
5|$|Germany {{has been}} the home of many famous inventors and engineers, {{including}} Hans Geiger, {{the creator of the}} Geiger counter; and Konrad Zuse, who built the first fully automatic <b>digital</b> <b>computer.</b> Such German inventors, engineers and industrialists as Count Ferdinand von Zeppelin, Otto Lilienthal, Gottlieb Daimler, Rudolf Diesel, Hugo Junkers and Karl Benz helped shape modern automotive and air transportation technology. German institutions like the German Aerospace Center (DLR) are the largest contributor to ESA. Aerospace engineer Wernher von Braun developed the first space rocket at Peenemünde and later on was a prominent member of NASA and developed the Saturn V Moon rocket. Heinrich Rudolf Hertz's work in the domain of electromagnetic radiation was pivotal to the development of modern telecommunication.|$|E
5|$|He {{enrolled}} {{in graduate school}} in electrical engineering at University of California, Berkeley, graduating with a Master of Science degree in 1953, and a Ph.D. in 1955. As {{a graduate student at}} Berkeley he assisted {{in the construction of the}} California <b>Digital</b> <b>Computer</b> project CALDIC. His graduate work led to eight patents. After completing his PhD, Engelbart stayed on at Berkeley as an assistant professor to teach for a year, and left when it was clear he could not pursue his vision there. Engelbart then formed a startup company, Digital Techniques, Inc., to commercialize some of his doctorate research on storage devices, but after a year decided instead to pursue the research he had been dreaming of since 1951.|$|E
5|$|In September 1940, Norbert Wiener {{approached}} Bush with {{a proposal}} to build a <b>digital</b> <b>computer.</b> Bush declined to provide NDRC funding for it {{on the grounds that}} he did not believe that it could be completed {{before the end of the}} war. The supporters of digital computers were disappointed at the decision, which they attributed to a preference for outmoded analog technology. In June 1943, the Army provided $500,000 to build the computer, which became ENIAC, the first general-purpose electronic computer. Having delayed its funding, Bush's prediction proved correct as ENIAC was not completed until December 1945, after the war had ended. His critics saw his attitude as a failure of vision.|$|E

5|$|The {{invention}} of electronic {{computers in the}} 1940s, along {{with the development of}} mathematical information theory, led to a realization that brains can potentially be understood as information processing systems. This concept formed the basis of the field of cybernetics, and eventually gave rise to the field now known as computational neuroscience. The earliest attempts at cybernetics were somewhat crude in that they treated the brain as essentially a <b>digital</b> <b>computer</b> in disguise, as for example in John von Neumann's 1958 book, The Computer and the Brain. Over the years, though, accumulating information about the electrical responses of brain cells recorded from behaving animals has steadily moved theoretical concepts in the direction of increasing realism.|$|E
5|$|Throughout {{the rest}} of the 1960s, <b>digital</b> <b>computer</b> games were created by {{increasingly}} numerous programmers and sometimes sold commercially in catalogs. As the audience for video games expanded to more than a few dozen research institutions with the falling cost of computers, and programming languages that would run on multiple types of computers were created, a wider variety of games began to be developed. Video games transitioned into a new era in the early 1970s with the launch of the commercial video game industry with the display of the coin-operated arcade game Galaxy Game and the release of the first widely available arcade game Computer Space, and then in 1972 with the release of the immensely successful arcade game Pong and the first home video game console, the Magnavox Odyssey, which launched the first generation of video game consoles.|$|E
5|$|Following the 1947 {{invention}} of the cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to use an electronic display, the first true video games were created in the early 1950s. Initially created as technology demonstrations, such as the Bertie the Brain and Nimrod computers in 1950 and 1951, video games also became the purview of academic research. A series of games, generally simulating real-world board games, were created at various research institutions to explore programming, human–computer interaction, and computer algorithms. These include OXO and Christopher Strachey's draughts program in 1952, the first software-based games to incorporate a CRT display, and several chess and checkers programs. Possibly the first video game created simply for entertainment was 1958's Tennis for Two, featuring moving graphics on an oscilloscope. As computing technology improved over time, computers became smaller and faster, and the ability to work on them was opened up to university employees and undergraduate students {{by the end of the}} 1950s. These new programmers began to create games for non-academic purposes, leading up to the 1962 release of Spacewar! as one of the earliest known <b>digital</b> <b>computer</b> games to be available outside a single research institute.|$|E

5000|$|Prior to {{the advent}} of <b>digital</b> <b>computers,</b> the {{electronics}} and other engineering disciplines used the terms system and hardware as they are still commonly used today. However, {{with the arrival of}} <b>digital</b> <b>computers</b> on the scene and the development of software engineering as a separate discipline, it was often necessary to distinguish among engineered hardware artifacts, software artifacts, and the combined artifacts.|$|R
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} {{telescope}} was originally completed, Lovell and Husband started contemplating {{the idea of}} upgrading the telescope so {{that it had a}} more accurate surface, and was controlled by a <b>digital</b> <b>computer.</b> Plans for this upgrade were created by Husband and Co., and were presented to Lovell in April 1964. Their plans became more urgent when fatigue cracks were discovered in the elevation drive system in September 1967. The telescope was only expected to have an operational lifespan of 10 years, and Husband had been warning about the decay of the telescope since 1963. The appearance of fatigue cracks was the first of these problems that threatened to stop the telescope working; if tey had not been put right, then the elevation system could have failed and perhaps jammed. The telescope was therefore repaired and upgraded to become the Mark IA; the £400,000 of funding to do this was announced on 8 July 1968 by the SRC. The upgrade was carried out in three phases, phase 1 lasting between September 1968 and February 1969, phase 2 between September and November 1969 and phase 3 between August 1970 and November 1971.|$|E
5|$|Tennis for Two is {{considered}} under some definitions {{to be the}} first video game. Other candidates with stronger candidacies from a technological standpoint include the 1947 cathode-ray tube amusement device, the earliest known interactive electronic game, though it did not run on a computing device; the 1950 Bertie the Brain, the earliest known game to run on a computer, though it used light bulbs for a display; and OXO and a draughts game by Christopher Strachey in 1952, the earliest <b>digital</b> <b>computer</b> games to display visuals on an electronic screen. Tennis for Two, though it contained no technological developments to separate it from earlier games, has the distinction of being the earliest known computer game with visuals created purely for entertainment purposes. Prior games were created primarily for academic research purposes or to demonstrate the computing power of the underlying machine, {{with the exception of the}} non-computer based cathode-ray tube amusement device. This, therefore, makes Tennis for Two the first video game under some definitions from a philosophical viewpoint rather than a technical one and a distinctive moment in the early history of video games.|$|E
5|$|The {{ancestors}} {{to these}} games include the cathode-ray tube amusement device, {{the earliest known}} interactive electronic game {{as well as the}} first to incorporate a cathode ray tube screen. The player simulates an artillery shell trajectory on a CRT screen connected to an oscilloscope, with a set of knobs and switches. The device uses purely analog electronics and does not use any <b>digital</b> <b>computer</b> or memory device or execute a program. It was patented by Thomas T. Goldsmith, Jr. and Estle Ray Mann in 1947. While the idea behind the game was potentially to use a television set as the display and thus sell the invention to consumers, as Goldsmith and Mann worked at television designer DuMont Laboratories, the patent, the first for an electronic game, was never used and the device never manufactured beyond the original handmade prototypes. This, along with the lack of electronic logic circuits, keeps the device from being considered the first video game. Around {{the same time as the}} device was invented, the earliest known written computer game was developed by Alan Turing and David Champernowne in 1948, a chess simulation called Turochamp, though it was never actually implemented on a computer as the code was too complicated to run on the machines of the time. Turing tested the code in a game in 1952 where he mimicked the operation of the code in a real chess game against an opponent, but was never able to run the program on a computer.|$|E
