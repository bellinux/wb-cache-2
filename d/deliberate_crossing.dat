5000|$|He was {{appointed}} Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in the 2014 Birthday Honours for services to scientific research. Sanders' nomination for the Royal Society reads: [...] Distinguished for his innovative applications of NMR spectroscopy in organic and biological chemistry, for his biomimetic porphyrin systems, and {{his theory of}} pi-pi interactions. His early explorations of lanthanide shift reagents greatly enhanced the power of NMR to solve questions of structure and conformation for the organic chemist. He then pioneered the use of NOE difference spectroscopy in organic chemistry, his achievements including the first complete analyses of the proton spectra of steroids. Sanders' techniques for acquiring, manipulating and interpreting NOE difference spectra have become world-wide standard laboratory practice. His notable contributions to biological chemistry through NMR include the first measurement of an enzymic kinetic isotope effect in live cells, {{and the use of}} deuterium NMR to elucidate the substrate specificity and absolute stereochemistry of intracellular bacterial formaldehyde dismutases. Most importantly, he has resolved many of the long-standing paradoxes between the known in situ enzymology and the apparently contradictory physical chemistry of isolated granules. Sanders is responsible for the creation and study of numerous model photosynthetic and enzymic systems based on porphyrins. These studies gave one of the first experimental verifications of the long-sought Marcus 'inverted region' in photoinduced electron transfer, and {{led to the development of}} a general model explaining pi-pi interactions. The model for pi-pi interactions, and its derived geometrical rules, is relevant to the structure of DNA duplexes and proteins; it promises to make a major impact in many areas. Like much of Sanders' work, it demolishes well-entrenched preconceptions through the clear use of simple insights and the <b>deliberate</b> <b>crossing</b> of disciplinary boundaries.|$|E
40|$|AbstractFragrance is an {{important}} component of end-use quality in rice. A set of 516 fragrant rice accessions were genotyped and over 80 % of them carried the badh 2. 7 allele. A subset of 144 mostly fragrant accessions, including nine of Oryza rufipogon, was then subjected to a detailed diversity and haplotype analysis. The level of linkage disequilibrium in the Badh 2 region was higher among the fragrant accessions. Re-sequencing in the Badh 2 region showed that badh 2. 7, badh 2. 2 and badh 2. 4 – 5 all arose in the japonica genepool, and spread later into the indica genepool as a result of <b>deliberate</b> <b>crossing.</b> However, loss-of-function alleles of Badh 2 are also found in the indica genepools, and then transferred into japonica. Evidence for three new possible FNPs was obtained from the Badh 2 sequence of 62 fragrant accessions. Based on these data, we have elaborated a model for the evolution of Badh 2 and its participation in the rice domestication process...|$|E
30|$|Two {{types of}} unsafe {{crossing}} behaviours {{can be distinguished}} according to pedestrian’s intention. The term “violation” is frequently used to distinguish <b>deliberate</b> <b>crossing</b> {{in the presence of}} active controls from unintentional rule breaches that are referred to as “errors”. In observational and other studies, young pedestrians are considered a high risk group of users who deliberately violate rules [9, 15]. Their crossing behaviours have been associated with sensation seeking tendencies (thrill-seeking) or perception of control, compared to elderly for example. Furthermore, male pedestrians are associated with higher risk-taking tendencies than females, however such a trend was only confirmed by one observational study in which male transgressors were identified slightly more often than females (59  %) [7, 14]. Finally, according to Clancy, Dickinson [15] as well as Metaxatos and Sriraj [1], motivations to deliberately transgress are associated with the given journey context (e.g. being in a hurry, avoiding missing the next train, being on time at work/school). In contrast, errors are often associated with elderly pedestrians likely to experience hearing, motor or visual impairments [6, 8, 9, 14] or with distraction [1, 6].|$|E

40|$|Abstract Background The 156 breeds of dog {{recognized}} by the American Kennel Club offer {{a unique opportunity to}} map genes important in genetic variation. Each breed features a defining constellation of morphological and behavioral traits, often generated by <b>deliberate</b> <b>crossing</b> of closely related individuals, leading to a high rate of genetic disease in many breeds. Understanding the genetic basis of both phenotypic variation and disease susceptibility in the dog provides new ways in which to dissect the genetics of human health and biology. Results To facilitate both genetic mapping and cloning efforts, we have constructed an integrated canine genome map that is both dense and accurate. The resulting resource encompasses 4249 markers, and was constructed using the RHDF 5000 - 2 whole genome radiation hybrid panel. The radiation hybrid (RH) map features a density of one marker every 900 Kb and contains 1760 bacterial artificial chromosome clones (BACs) localized to 1423 unique positions, 851 of which have also been mapped by fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). The two data sets show excellent concordance. Excluding the Y chromosome, the map features an RH/FISH mapped BAC every 3. 5 Mb and an RH mapped BAC-end, on average, every 2 Mb. For 2233 markers, the orthologous human genes have been established, allowing the identification of 79 conserved segments (CS) between the dog and human genomes, dramatically extending the length of most previously described CS. Conclusions These results provide a necessary resource for the canine genome mapping community to undertake positional cloning experiments and provide new insights into the comparative canine-human genome maps. </p...|$|E
40|$|Crop landraces (largely {{resulting}} from adaptation and continuous selection by farmers) are more diverse within field populations than modern cultivars (produced by <b>deliberate</b> <b>crossing),</b> yet their distribution {{has continued to}} shrink in the past decades. The temporal dynamics of this shrinking is little known. The analysis of genetic variation within and between landraces is essential for making efficient breeding and conservation decisions with the available variability. Seven diploid landraces originally from Tanzania, 37 triploid landraces (24 East African highland bananas (EAHB); 5 'Ilalyi' (AAA genome), and 8 ill-defined types from Tanzania), 6 exotic triploids, and 3 exotic diploids originally from the International Transit Center were genotyped with simple sequence repeat (SSR) markers. This study sought to understand the genetic relationship between the EAHB and the diploid landraces and other banana groups (local triploid landraces, and introduced (exotic) cultivars) so as {{to decide whether to}} include the diploids in the breeding scheme of EAHB. Results showed the highest average genetic distance (degree of genomic difference by proportion) within the diploids (0. 5666), followed by the hybrid triploids (0. 4568) and the lowest within the 'Ilalyi' (0. 0748) and the EAHB (0. 0827) landraces. The variation within each clone set of EAHB was higher in 'Nakitembe' (0. 0948) and 'Musakala' (0. 1052). These two are commercial clone sets whose variation may be due to high and long-term selection pressure. In contrast, between the banana groups, the diploid landraces were more distant (highest average genetic distance) from the triploid landraces (0. 4351 - 0. 4430) and could thus provide useful breeding traits. On the other side, the triploid landraces had a narrow genetic base which should be broadened. Results did not identify those local east African diploids closest to the EAHB or other local triploids, although local diploids show breeding potential. This could widen the genetic base and probably improve performance of the triploid landraces. Peer Revie...|$|E

50|$|James Allen (1832-1906) of Shepton Mallet was {{probably}} {{the first person to}} raise hybrid snowdrops from seed made from <b>deliberate</b> <b>crosses.</b> In 1891 he reported that he grew every known species of Galanthus and had raised over 100 distinct seedlings, but much of his collection was lost to botrytis and narcissus fly soon afterward. At least two of his cultivars, G. 'Magnet' and G. 'Merlin', survive and are widely grown by collectors. He also raised hybrids which he called G. 'Galatea' and G. 'Robin Hood', but the plants now grown under those names today may not be the same as those he selected. Galanthus x allenii is a hybrid, of unknown origin, that appeared in a batch of G. latifolius (now called G. platyphyllus), which Allen had got from an Austrian supplier in 1883 (according to Bishop et al. {{it is more likely that}} the bulbs were another broad-leaved species, G. woronowii, often confused with G. platyphyllus). The bulbs were most probably collected in the Caucasus but G. ×allenii has never been found in the wild since then, so one can only speculate where the cross occurred and what other species may have been involved. It is a handsome plant with broad, greenish-grey foliage and fairly large flowers which smell of bitter almonds. Margery Fish at East Lambrook Manor was another enthusiast and popularizer of Galanthus nivalis and its varieties in the 1950s and 1960s.|$|R

25|$|Classical plant {{breeding}} uses <b>deliberate</b> interbreeding (<b>crossing)</b> of closely or distantly related individuals to produce new crop varieties or lines with desirable properties. Plants are crossbred to introduce traits/genes from one variety or line {{into a new}} genetic background. For example, a mildew-resistant pea may be crossed with a high-yielding but susceptible pea, {{the goal of the}} cross being to introduce mildew resistance without losing the high-yield characteristics. Progeny from the cross would then be crossed with the high-yielding parent to ensure that the progeny were most like the high-yielding parent, (backcrossing). The progeny from that cross would then be tested for yield and mildew resistance and high-yielding resistant plants would be further developed. Plants may also be crossed with themselves to produce inbred varieties for breeding.|$|R

40|$|Provision of {{independent}} scientific advice {{is central to}} the operation of regional fisheries management organizations (RFMOs) even though RFMOs are largely policy (and political) instruments. Political pressures and intervention in science and crossing of the boundaries between scientific and political processes, however, appear to be relatively common. A case study is presented to illustrate some ways in which this occurs. It involves a paper that was withdrawn from scientific meetings of two RFMOs as a result of largely political (rather than scientific) concerns. The details involved in this incident are important for understanding the ways in which political intervention in independent scientific process can and does occur. Moreover, unless one is directly involved in actions of this kind, it is impossible from the reports of RFMOs' scientific bodies to assess whether, and the extent to which, there has been political intervention in the scientific process. It is argued that the nature of the working arrangements in these scientific committees can engender <b>deliberate</b> or inadvertent <b>crossing</b> of the boundaries between scientific independence and the political processes of RFMOs, both of which are important components of RFMO operation. Further, there is very little documentation or assessment of the generic extent of such problems. No simple solutions or reforms exist for isolating scientific advice from political agenda in the processes of RFMOs but it is suggested that increased discussion of the problem along with better understanding and clarity of the role of science in the management process may lead to improved recognition of the importance {{of independent}} scientific analyses and advice.

40|$|Once upon a {{time there}} was a world where the subject {{replaced}} the object by the idea. This simulacrum called Reason found a way to constitute its very objectivity through the act of representation. Thanks to an autonomous transcendental field allowing individuals to periodise themselves through their own historiographical accounts, generations of cultural practitioners have since been able to reinvent new convenient fictions empowering the fragments of the past via the superior status of the written idea. Then, came the image subverting with its immediate apprehension of forms the previous simulacrum that had constituted the locus of absolute objectivity. Along with the very disposition of seeing, a new movement of retention and protention going far beyond conscious awareness (since it constitutes it), modified the realm of experience and the frame of action from which is manufactured the political present of the latest ethical subject. In the age of visual culture, the medium of existence operating in real time gives the illusion of transparency and therefore bypasses the simulacrum of the idea by speaking directly, that is viscerally, the language of the will. Therefore, it is by a new folding of Being, that is, by a process of personalisation transforming the relationship of the self with itself and bringing its conduct into compliance with one's ideal behaviour, that the new aesthetic dimensions of language have normalised the bodies and transformed the cultural imaginary of the post-literate generation into a new quest for self-realisation—Video ergo sum: I see (myself) therefore I am [...] . Through the cult of immediate experience and self-referentiality taking place in this new ideographic sphere of impressions (whose ideas are the copies as Hume tells us), the historically-desiring, electronically-minded and socially-constructed Coming Generation can pretend to enlarge its view of the world, while being the terminal materialisation of a collective memory and imagination generating a self-presence obsessed by the quest for legitimacy. Down Under in the supermarkets of postmodern humanism, identity politics and hybridity, reconciliation and cultural diversity, Mardi Gras and the virtual republic, have all emerged with the shift from the representation of the literal to the presence of the figurative produced by the late sensible form of the signifier. With a reconfigured eye giving birth to a reconfigured "I", the new "fair dinkum" agency can consume a sense of guilt and then reconsume the signs of emancipation, denounce "European" colonialism and then "call" for social justice, in order to see and experience itself as "becoming" organically grown, culturally diverse and fundamentally tolerant. In this manufacturing of an ideal ethical substance taking place in a new narcissistic age of simulation, the new-fashioned dynasty of judicious philanthropists can nullify the very idea according to which colonists live in the colonies, while playing at being post-colonial by turning old fallacies into new romantic lies. It is, indeed, with n(r) ational pride that the new sprung consuming human herd is able to proclaim in the name of Reason the end of blinkered polarities to the point of considering itself as the "victim" of a fraudulent old-age Eurocentrism. In the name of so-called cross-cultural histories, it is commonplace in Australia to walk and also to spit on the graves of the old fellows and to excommunicate as peremptory the foundational vision of what is described as the old world—through the bashing of the "whingeing Poms", the "bloody French" and the "damned rednecks"—while refusing to consider the latest moralism of convictions as a mere feeling made of fugitive hope and self-satisfying good intentions-inmeanings. Mourning with a professional diaspora eager to secure its privilege by plumbing the depths of misery with the silences of Said's Orientalism, the new angels of human progress living in the richest Anglo-Celtic enclave in the world, labour in "subaltern" studies in order to produce themselves as the incarnation of this exquisite virtue legitimising their own "postcolonial" condition. As the simple minded Prince Muyichkine inhabited by the soul of a child, as the idiot who escaped from a universe of nostalgia to join l'Education Sentimentale of the so-called New World, I travelled through the ecstasy of time until I reached the age of innocence of the Coming Generation. Yet, by the <b>deliberate</b> act of <b>crossing</b> times and cultures, forms and possible domains of knowledge, as the alien frog lost among the songless birds, I have found myself to be institutionally unwise. Instead of playing at being "progressive" I have been caught by the philosophies of suspicion to the point of developing an incredulity toward the critique of colonialism, which led me to sustain a lonely but corrosive assault on ethical complacency. Restricting myself to the world of language and wandering alone in the land of subjectivity, I have examined this in-built self-destructing discourse in which the compassionate and apparently well-tempered Coming Generation "calling" for the end of colonialism, attempts to pay back its priceless land by the brandishing of virtuousness. In fact, it came to my mind that deducing an hyperreal "is" from a politically correct and morally prescriptive "ought" is not decolonisation, but rather a process of fictional self-fashioning where only the very negation of an imagined past has become visible in the house of being. Thus, by following a strategy of disruption, I have attempted to expose the existential and ontological foundation of the postcolonial discourse, that is, the transcendental and formal logic producing this very ideal that can only deny itself as reality. In this thesis it is argued that in the age of a simulated activism figuratively demonstrating the goodness of a Coming Generation (proudly walking on the bridges of sorrow), the postcolonial discourse is the n(r) ationalism of an electronic age that entertains a vision of the future by dressing up in aesthetics the rub-a-dub of social justice and racial tolerance. Despite its engaging nature, the ideal produced by the "progressive" discourse remains the not-yet of a double process of personalisation and periodisation operating within the intra-temporality of being secured by the play of differences, that is, an endless deferral (post-colonialism) that produces difference (colonialism) in the cultural sphere, but not decolonisation. It is, therefore, an onto-theology of guilt and hope where the so-called organic intellectuals of the selfperceived New World condemn the "imperialists" and prattle humanely about the "repressed" in order to periodise their constituency and re-present themselves as custodians of a new moral rectitude that remains a redemptive illusion. In short, the bulk of self-indulgent humane criticism about the past is mainly aimed at justifying the very moral prejudices the local petty bourgeoisie condemns. And this is why no one does the job of the colonials better than the socalled well-tempered and compassionate people "calling" for cross-cultural reflections and antidiscrimination. Naturally, this form of intellectual inquest treating the pursuit of the ideals with vigour, goes against a lot of presupposed concepts, and therefore {{is not going to be}} appreciated in every corners of the ethical institutions. But in a lucky country where blacks (still) die twenty years before the sentimental heirs of the puritan warriors, it is necessary to expose the ideas and moral convictions of the Coming Generation for their inadequacy, and consequently, to argue that although necessary its convenient critique of colonialism is also a pervasive cultural practice that perpetuates the dark side of the dream in order to legitimise the condition of the well-wishers. Can Dionysus forgive me for having looked beneath the masks of the ideals before dissertating on the birth of the post-colonial tragedy from an age of self-referentiality where the propensity of preaching virtues as a means of keeping the lower classes in order is shaped by new aesthetic [...] ...|$|R
