40|$|Although {{enterprise}} {{risk management}} (ERM) has been advocated {{in the construction}} industry, its implementation is still plagued with <b>hindrances.</b> The objectives are to identify the critical <b>hindrances</b> to ERM implementation in Chinese construction firms (CCFs) and investigate the interrelationships among these critical <b>hindrances.</b> To achieve the objectives, 36 <b>hindrances</b> were identified through a literature review and a questionnaire survey was performed with 119 respondents. The results indicated that 20 <b>hindrances</b> were deemed critical, among which insufficient resources (e. g., time, money, and people) was ranked top. Additionally, the critical <b>hindrances</b> were categorized into lack of relevant resources and procedures (LRRP), lack of senior-level support and leadership (LSSL), and lack of high-quality data (LHQD). LSSL contributed to LRRP, whereas LRRP resulted in LHQD. The managerial implications drawn from these results can help the management take measures to overcome them. Although this study is focused on CCFs, other firms may use the identified <b>hindrances</b> and follow the method to prepare their customized list of <b>hindrances...</b>|$|R

40|$|In recent years, {{holding a}} {{holistic}} view of risk management {{has become the}} trend in various industries. In this trend, enterprise risk management (ERM) has been viewed as the fundamental paradigm and has attracted the attention from the academics and practitioners worldwide. Implementing ERM in construction firms is inevitably associated with organizational learning. The objectives {{of this study are}} to (1) identify the critical <b>hindrances</b> to ERM in Chinese construction firms (CCFs) and (2) analyze them in tandem with theories of organizational learning. To achieve these objectives, a total of 36 <b>hindrances</b> to ERM and 12 <b>hindrances</b> to organizational learning were identified through a literature review, and a questionnaire survey was performed with 119 respondents from 119 CCFs in the global construction market. The results indicated that 20 <b>hindrances</b> were deemed critical, among which “insufficient resources (e. g. time, money, people, etc.) ”, “lack of a formalized ERM process”, and “lack of internal knowledge, skills and expertise” were the top three <b>hindrances.</b> In addition, the critical <b>hindrances</b> to ERM were interpreted from the perspective of organizational learning, and the 12 <b>hindrances</b> to organizational learning were linked to the critical <b>hindrances</b> to ERM. This study presents the theoretical rationale behind the critical <b>hindrances</b> to ERM implementation and contributes to the literature through interpreting ERM implementation from an organizational learning perspective...|$|R

50|$|Any {{problem which}} arises in {{meditation}} {{will be one}} of these Five <b>Hindrances,</b> or a combination. So, if one experiences any difficulty, use the scheme of the Five <b>Hindrances</b> as a 'check list' to identify the main problem.

When the Five <b>Hindrances</b> are fully overcome, there is no barrier between the meditator and the bliss of Jhana. Therefore, the certain test that these Five <b>Hindrances</b> are really overcome is the ability to access Jhana.|$|R

In this case study, surveys and interviews were used to study the <b>hindrances</b> for agile and literature was used to provide the recommendations towards the detected <b>hindrances.</b> Results. 4 <b>hindrances</b> were detected.

40|$|Purpose– The {{specific}} {{purposes of}} this paper are: to identify the critical drivers for and <b>hindrances</b> to enterprise risk management (ERM) implementation; and to compare the influence of these factors on ERM implementation between large and small-medium (SM) Chinese construction firms (CCFs) in Singapore. Design/methodology/approach– A questionnaire survey was conducted and responses were received from 35 experienced managers in CCFs operating in Singapore. Findings– A total of 13 drivers and 22 <b>hindrances</b> were found critical to ERM implementation in Singapore-based CCFs. “Improved decision making” were the top influential driver, while “insufficient resources (e. g. time, money, people, etc.) ” were the most significant <b>hindrances.</b> Additionally, despite {{significant differences in the}} mean scores of seven drivers and four <b>hindrances,</b> the large and SM CCFs agreed on the rankings of drivers and <b>hindrances,</b> respectively. Research limitations/implications– As the survey was performed with the Singapore-based CCFs, there may be geographical limitation on the identification of the critical drivers for and <b>hindrances</b> to ERM implementation. The sample size was still small, despite a relatively high response rate. Practical implications– The findings of this study allow the management to strengthen the positive influence from the drivers and overcome the challenges posed by the significant <b>hindrances.</b> Originality/value– Despite studies on ERM in various industries, few studies have attempted to disclose the factors driving and hindering ERM implementation in construction firms. Thus, this study expands the existing literature relating to ERM. An understanding of the drivers for ERM implementation enables the management to obtain sufficient support for the ERM program and strengthen the positive influence from the drivers. The identification of the <b>hindrances</b> allows the management to be clear about the challenges faced by the ERM program and take measures to diminish their negative influence and overcome them. Additionally, other construction firms can use the drivers and <b>hindrances</b> identified in this study to prepare their customized list of drivers and <b>hindrances...</b>|$|R

Although sales of the Wooden Leg book did well, better than Marquis had expected, this controversy was to prove a <b>hindrance</b> to his chances of future book publications. Marquis believed he had multiple Indian sources verifying this account, and there were no surviving whites to contradict it.

5|$|A second method {{involves}} artificially inseminating {{an elephant}} egg cell with sperm cells from a frozen woolly mammoth carcass. The resulting offspring {{would be an}} elephant–mammoth hybrid, and the process {{would have to be}} repeated so more hybrids could be used in breeding. After several generations of cross-breeding these hybrids, an almost pure woolly mammoth would be produced. The fact that sperm cells of modern mammals are viable for 15 years at most after deep-freezing is a <b>hindrance</b> to this method.
