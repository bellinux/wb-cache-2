40|$|Abstract — This paper {{proposes a}} simple inter-symbol {{interference}} (ISI) and inter-block interference (IBI) elimination scheme {{for a single}} carrier block transmission with cyclic prefix (SC-CP) system with an insufficient guard interval (GI). In the SC-CP system, only limited number of symbols in a transmitted block cause the interferences, while all the information data contribute to the interferences in the orthogonal frequency division multiplexing (OFDM) system. Therefore, in the SC-CP system, the interferences can be exterminated by only setting transmitted signals to be 0 at certain time slots in a transmitted signal block without changing any parameters or configuration of the system, such as the length of GI. The proposed scheme also {{can be considered as}} a simple loading scheme in temporal domain, which tries not to use time slots contaminated by the ISI and the IBI. Moreover, this paper also proposes a pilot signal configuration for the SC-CP system, which enable us to estimate channel impulse response in the discrete frequency domain even when the channel order is longer than the GI <b>length.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations show that the proposed schemes can significantly improve bit error rate (BER) performance and accuracy of the channel estimation when the channel order is larger than the length of the GI...|$|R

40|$|The {{main purpose}} of this paper is to study the {{performance}} of two linear channel estimators for LTE Downlink systems, the Least Square Error (LSE) and the Linear Minimum Mean Square Error (LMMSE). As LTE is a MIMO-OFDM based system, a cyclic prefix is inserted at the beginning of each transmitted OFDM symbol in order to completely suppress both inter-carrier interference (ICI) and inter-symbol interference (ISI). Usually, the cyclic prefix is equal to or longer than the channel length but in some cases and because of some unforeseen channel behaviour, the cyclic prefix can be shorter. Therefore, we propose to study the performance of the two linear estimators under the effect of the channel <b>length.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations show that, in the case where the cyclic prefix is equal to or longer than the channel length,LMMSE performs better than LSE but at the cost of computational complexity. In the other case, LMMSE continue to improve its performance only for low SNR values but it degrades for high SNR values in which LS shows better performance for LTE Downlink systems. MATLAB Monte –Carlo simulations are used to evaluate the performance of the studied estimators in terms of Mean Square Error (MSE) and Bit Error Rate (BER) for 22 LTE Downlink systems...|$|R

40|$|Background: Brugada {{syndrome}} (BrS) is {{an inherited}} electrical disorder {{associated with a}} high incidence of sudden death. In a minority of patients, it has been linked to mutations in SCN 5 A, the gene encoding the pore-forming alpha-subunit of the cardiac Na+ channel. Other causally related genes still await identification. We evaluated the role of HERG (KCNH 2), which encodes the alpha-subunit of the rapid delayed rectifier K+ channel (I-Kr), in BrS. Methods and results: In two unrelated SCN 5 A mutation-negative patients, different amino acid changes in the C-terminal domain of the HERG channel (G 873 S and N 985 S) were identified. Voltage-clamp experiments on transfected HEK- 293 cells show that these changes increase I-Kr density and cause a negative shift of voltage-dependent inactivation, resulting in increased rectification. Action potential (AP) clamp experiments reveal increased transient HERG peak currents (I-peak) during phase- 0 and phase- 1 of the ventricular AP, particularly at short cycle <b>length.</b> <b>Computer</b> simulations demonstrate that the increased I-peak enhances the susceptibility to loss of the AP-dome typically in right ventricular subepicardial myocytes, thereby contributing to the BrS phenotype. Conclusion: Our study reveals a modulatory role Of I-Kr in BrS. These findings may provide better understanding of BrS and have implications for diagnosis and therapy.

The basic aim of this project is to study both theoretically and experimentally the behaviour and performance of inflatable dams under hydrostatic and hydrodynamic conditions {{and to develop a}} design method. A finite element approach is developed in order to analyse air, water and a combination of air and water inflated dams to determine the shape and tension of the membrane of the dam under hydrostatic and hydrodynamic conditions. A series of models of inflatable dams were constructed and tested under hydrostatic and hydrodynamic conditions. The shapes of these models were compared with the theoretical shapes obtained from the theoretical analysis. The comparison shows there was a good relationship between the experimental and theoretical shapes. A new formula was derived for calculating the rate of flow over the air, water and air/water inflated dams theoretically.
