50|$|The STQ {{is based}} on the Eastern-European {{tradition}} of experiments investigating the types and properties of nervous systems. This tradition is the longest in (110 years old) among all traditions of temperamental research. It started from extensive experiments on several species of mammals, and then continued with human adults and children within the Pavlovian Institute of <b>Highest</b> <b>Nervous</b> <b>Activity</b> (Pavlov, 1941, 1957). It then was continued within the Laboratory of Differential Psychophysiology and Differential Psychology (Institute of Psychology of the Russian Academy of Sciences), supervised by Boris Teplov (1963), then Vladimir Nebylitsyn (1972), and then Vladimir Rusalov (1979).The STQ has several versions, which are based on two models of the structure of temperament: Rusalov`s model and Trofimova`s model. All versions of the STQ are based on the Activity-specific approach in temperament research. This approach differentiates between the traits related to 3 aspects of behavior: social-verbal, physical and mental. All models and all modern versions of the STQ have 12 temperament scales.|$|R

40|$|Background/purpose: The {{behavioral}} control of child patients {{is an important}} issue in pediatric dentistry. The emotional states of the mothers of patients may influence the attitudes of their children. The aim {{of this study was to}} investigate the emotional states estimated from physiological responses of child patients and the subjective anxieties of their mothers during dental treatments and discuss the emotional relationships between children and their mothers. Materials and methods: To assess physiological responses associated with emotional changes induced by dental treatments in child patients aged 3 – 6 years, activity in the autonomic nervous were analyzed from variations in inter-beat intervals in electrocardiogram. Anxiety levels of accompanying mothers were examined using the State Trait Anxiety Inventory, which was filled out during the treatment of their child. Results: Regarding the stress of child patients from the aspect of autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>activities</b> during dental treatments, comparison between the cooperative and uncooperative patient groups showed that the uncooperative group demonstrated significantly <b>higher</b> sympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>activity</b> and significantly lower parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>activity</b> relative to the cooperative group, and their accompanying mothers showed significantly higher state anxiety scores relative to the mothers of cooperative children. Moreover, positive correlation between state anxiety scores of mothers and sympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>activities</b> of their children was observed. Conclusion: These results indicated that uncooperative child patients undergo more stress and their mothers feel more anxiety from dental treatments, resulting in an emotional relationship between children and their mothers, which requires dental professionals to make special considerations to calm the anxiety of the mother, as well as the stress of the child patient...|$|R
50|$|The cheetah is {{the fastest}} land animal in the world. It was {{previously}} thought that the body temperature of a cheetah increases during a hunt due to high metabolic activity. In {{a short period of}} time during a chase, a cheetah may produce 60 times more heat than at rest, with much of the heat, produced from glycolysis, stored to possibly raise the body temperature. The claim was supported by data from experiments in which two cheetahs ran on a treadmill for minutes on end but contradicted by studies in natural settings, which indicate that body temperature stays relatively the same during a hunt. A 2013 study suggested stress hyperthermia and a slight increase in body temperature after a hunt. The cheetah's nervousness after a hunt may induce stress hyperthermia, which involves <b>high</b> sympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>activity</b> and raises the body temperature. After a hunt, the risk of another predator taking its kill is great, and the cheetah is on high alert and stressed. The increased sympathetic activity prepares the cheetah's body to run when another predator approaches. In the 2013 study, even the cheetah that did not chase the prey experienced an increase in body temperature once the prey was caught, showing increased sympathetic activity.|$|R

Homskaya summarizes Luria's approach as centering on: [...] "The application of the Method of Motor Associations (which) allowed investigators to reveal difficulties experienced by (unskilled) children {{in the process of}} forming conditioned links as well as restructuring and compensating by means of speech ... (Unskilled) children demonstrated acute dysfunction of the generalizing and regulating functions of speech." [...] Taking this direction, already by the mid-1950s, [...] "Luria for the first time proposed his ideas about the differences of neurodynamic processes in different functional systems, primarily in verbal and motor systems." [...] Luria identified the three stages of language development in children in terms of [...] "the formation of the mechanisms of voluntary actions: actions {{in the absence of a}} regulative verbal influence, actions with a nonspecific influence, and, finally, actions with a selective verbal influence." [...] For Luria, [...] "The regulating function of speech thus appears as a main factor in the formation of voluntary behavior ... at first, the activating function is formed, and then the inhibitory, regulatory function." ...|$|R

5000|$|In {{his long}} speech, Anatoly Ivanov-Smolenskiy {{reviewed}} of Pavlov’s achievements {{in the development}} of the theory of <b>higher</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>activity.</b> According to Ivanov-Smolenskiy, Pavlov’s contribution to psychiatry was [...] "of immense value" [...] as opposed to the failure of foreign scientists who did not achieve anything important. Ivanov-Smolenskiy then praised some Russian physiologists and condemned the others. He praised L. A. Andreev and M. K. Petrova as the followers of Pavlov's legacy. He accused Anokhin, Kupalov, and Orbeli. Anokhin was blamed for suggesting that Pavlov’s theory was isolated from foreign science and needed improvement, for leaning toward Sherrington’s concept of integration, and for criticizing Pavlov’s conception of cortical inhibition. Kupalov was accused of distorting Pavlov’s conceptualization of reflexes. Ivanov-Smolenskiy characterized Orbeli's views of the relation between subjective experience and objective reality as anti-Pavlovian because — unlike Pavlov who believed that subjective, psychological experience was superimposed on the objective experience of the environment — Orbeli separated the subjective and objective and adhered to psychophysiological parallelism. Orbeli was also blamed for diverging from Pavlov's deterministic position on the mechanisms of <b>higher</b> <b>nervous</b> <b>activity.</b>|$|E

40|$|Background : Fatigue is {{the most}} common and {{distressing}} symptom reported by breast cancer survivors and yet the pathophysiology of cancer-related fatigue remains largely unknown. Fatigue is associated with lower parasympathetic and <b>higher</b> sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system <b>activity</b> in non-cancer samples, but only one study has demonstrated this same relationship in breast cancer survivors. This study evaluates the relationship between fatigue and basal autonomic <b>nervous</b> system <b>activity</b> as measured by heart rate variability (HRV) in a sample of breast cancer survivors. Methods : Women who had been diagnosed with early stage breast cancer before the age of 50 were recruited from the UCLA tumor registry and completed psychological questionnaires, including measures of fatigue. A subset of these women (n= 30) participated in a follow-up study in which they completed measures of fatigue, energy and mood four times per day for 5 days using electronic diaries, provided 3 days of saliva samples for cortisol assessment and underwent physiological assessment including electrocardiogram (ECG). HRV was assessed via ECG R-R wave spectral and time sequence analysis. Results : Questionnaire measures of fatigue were negatively associated with indices of parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> system <b>activity,</b> B=&#x 200 A;&#x 2212;&#x 200 A; 3. 85, p&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 0. 04 for RMSSD (root of the mean squared difference of successive normal to normal waves) and B=&#x 200 A;&#x 2212;&#x 200 A; 76. 97, p&#x 200 A;=&#x 200 A; 0. 04 for LF power % (low-frequency wave power percentage).

However, fatigue indices were not associated with sympathetic <b>nervous</b> system <b>activity</b> as measured by low- to high-frequency wave ratio. Of note, fatigue was not associated with average daily cortisol output (AUC). Conclusions : Lower HRV has been associated with increased chronic inflammation, which is elevated in cancer survivors reporting persistent fatigue, thus providing insight into potential system interactions underlying the mechanisms for cancer-related fatigue...|$|R

30|$|Common {{physiological}} evaluations include (1) brain <b>activity,</b> (2) autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>activity,</b> (3) endocrine activity, and (4) {{immune system}} activity [33]. Until recently, {{the most commonly}} used indicator of brain activity was electroencephalography (EEG), but the mainstream of recent research has been to measure oxygenated hemoglobin (oxy-Hb) concentration in the prefrontal cortex using near-infrared spectroscopy (NIRS). Initial indicators of autonomic <b>nervous</b> <b>activity</b> included blood pressure, heart rate, pupil diameter, and pupillary light reflex, but it is more common now to measure heart rate variability (HRV), which can be separated into evaluations of sympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>activity</b> and parasympathetic <b>nervous</b> <b>activity.</b> For an endocrine index, the improvement of analytical techniques has enabled the measurement of stress hormones contained in saliva, such as cortisol concentration.
