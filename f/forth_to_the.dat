5|$|Another {{historical}} {{source was}} the enormous encyclopedia Prime Tortoise of the Record Bureau published by 1013, {{one of the}} Four Great Books of Song. Divided into 1000 volumes of 9.4 million written Chinese characters, this book provided important information on political essays of the period, extensive autobiographies on rulers and various subjects, {{as well as a}} multitude of memorials and decrees brought <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> imperial court. However, the official history of the Song dynasty was the Song Shi, compiled in 1345 during the Yuan dynasty. The recorded history of the Jurchen Jin dynasty, the Jin Shi, was compiled in the same year. This historical book is one of the classic Twenty-Four Histories of China.|$|E
5|$|In 1236 a large Mongol {{army was}} {{collected}} under the supreme leadership of Batu Khan and set <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> west, {{in one of}} the greatest invasions in world's history. The Mongols’ most devastating attacks against the western territories of the Desht-i Quipchaq (‘the steppe of the Cumans’) took place in 1237–1238. The development of the battles was not recorded in the sources, but the Cuman's subsequent migration to Hungary, Bulgaria and other neighboring territories is eloquent enough. Although some Cuman groups survived the Mongol invasion,the Cuman aristocracy was slain. The steppes of eastern Europe were conquered by Batu Khan's army and became parts of the Golden Horde.|$|E
5|$|Soon {{after his}} {{announcement}} of victory, Agricola was recalled to Rome by Domitian and his post passed to Sallustius Lucullus. Agricola's successors were seemingly {{unable or unwilling}} to further subdue the far north. Despite his apparent successes, Agricola himself fell out of favour and it is possible that Domitian may have been informed of the fraudulence of his claims to have won a significant victory. The fortress at Inchtuthil was dismantled before its completion and the other fortifications of the Gask Ridge (erected to consolidate the Roman presence in Scotland in the aftermath of Mons Graupius) were abandoned within the space of a few years. It is possible that the costs of a drawn-out war outweighed any economic or political benefit and it was deemed more profitable to leave the Caledonians to themselves. By 87 the occupation was limited to the Southern Uplands {{and by the end of}} the 1st century the northern limit of Roman expansion was a line drawn between the Tyne and Solway Firth. Elginhaugh fort, in Midlothian, dates to about this period as may Castle Greg in West Lothian, which was most likely used as a monitoring base for an east-west road running along the foot of the nearby Pentlands, from the <b>Forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Clyde Valley.|$|E

5|$|While II Canadian Corps pushed {{south from}} Caen toward Falaise in Operation Totalize on 8 August, Bradley and Montgomery {{realised}} {{that there was}} an opportunity for the bulk of the German forces to be trapped at Falaise. The Third Army continued the encirclement from the south, reaching Alençon on 11August. Although Hitler continued to insist until 14 August that his forces should counter-attack, Kluge and his officers began planning a retreat eastward. The German forces were severely hampered by Hitler's insistence on making all major decisions himself, which left his forces without orders for periods as long as 24 hours while information was sent back and <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Führer's residence at Obersalzberg in Bavaria. On the evening of 12 August, Patton asked Bradley if his forces should continue northward to close the gap and encircle the German forces. Bradley refused, because Montgomery had already assigned the First Canadian Army to take the territory from the north. The Canadians met heavy resistance and captured Falaise on 16 August. The gap was closed on 21 August, trapping 50,000 German troops but {{more than a third of}} the German 7th Army and the remnants of nine of the eleven Panzer divisions had escaped to the east. Montgomery's decision-making regarding the Falaise Gap was criticised at the time by American commanders, especially Patton, although Bradley was more sympathetic and believed Patton would not have been able to close the gap. The issue has been the subject of much discussion among historians, criticism being levelled at American, British and Canadian forces. Hitler relieved Kluge of his command of OB West on 15 August and replaced him with Field Marshal Walter Model. Kluge committed suicide on 19 August after Hitler became aware of his involvement in the 20 July plot. An invasion in southern France (Operation Dragoon) was launched on 15 August.|$|E

25|$|In particular, this norm gets smaller when {{a number}} is multiplied by p, in sharp {{contrast}} to the usual absolute value (also referred to as the infinite prime). While completing Q (roughly, filling the gaps) with respect to the absolute value yields the field of real numbers, completing with respect to the p-adic norm |−|p yields the field of p-adic numbers. These are essentially all possible ways to complete Q, by Ostrowski's theorem. Certain arithmetic questions related to Q or more general global fields may be transferred back and <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> completed (or local) fields.

25|$|The Atlantic {{shipping}} terminal was in Colon, Panama. The Pacific terminal was in Panama City. The 48-mile {{double track}} railway {{was the first}} transcontinental railway and an engineering marvel of the era.

25|$|In the Early Middle Ages, Scotland saw several {{ethnic or}} {{cultural}} groups mentioned in contemporary sources, namely the Picts, the Gaels, the Britons, and the Angles, {{with the latter}} settling in the southeast of the country. Culturally, these peoples are grouped according to language. Most of Scotland until the 13th century spoke Celtic languages and these included, at least initially, the Britons, {{as well as the}} Gaels and the Picts. Germanic peoples included the Angles of Northumbria, who settled in south-eastern Scotland in the region between the Firth of <b>Forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> north and the River Tweed to the south. They also occupied the south-west of Scotland up to and including the Plain of Kyle and their language, Old English, was the earliest form of the language which eventually became known as Scots.|$|E

25|$|Duterte {{was born}} on March 28, 1945, in Maasin. His {{maternal}} grandfather was a Chinese immigrant from Xiamen, Fujian. His father was Vicente G. Duterte (1911–1968), a Cebuano lawyer, and his mother, Soledad Duterte (née Roa; 1916–2012), was a school teacher from Cabadbaran, Agusan and a civic leader of Maranao descent. Duterte's father was mayor of Danao, Cebu, and subsequently the provincial governor of (the then-undivided) Davao province. Rodrigo's cousin Ronald was mayor of Cebu City from 1983 to 1986. Ronald's father, Ramon Duterte, also held the position from 1957 to 1959. The Dutertes consider the Cebu-based political families of the Durano and the Almendras clan as relatives. Duterte also has relatives from the Roa clan in Leyte through his mother's side. Duterte's family lived in Maasin, and in his father's hometown in Danao, until he was four years old. The Dutertes initially moved to Mindanao in 1948 but still went back and <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> Visayas until 1949. They finally settled in the Davao Region in 1950. Vicente worked as a lawyer engaged in private practice. Soledad worked as a teacher until 1952 when Vicente entered politics.|$|E

25|$|When a {{young worker}} leaves the nest {{for the first}} time, it will {{generally}} make 2 to 3 'orientation flights' in order to familiarize itself with {{the entrance to the}} colony amidst the surrounding landscape. In the first flight, the worker flies approximately 25nbsp&cm out of the nest at once and then quickly turns around to face the entrance. The wasp slowly flies back and <b>forth</b> <b>to</b> <b>the</b> nest several times, surveying an angle that is approximately 90 degrees, while facing the entrance. Then, the wasp promptly returns to the nest, the whole flight lasting only about one minute or less. Soon after returning from the first flight, the wasp will leave the nest in a similar fashion, but this time ventures out approximately 15 to 20 meters and covers an angle of approximately 280 degrees. Once 2 meters away, V. rufa will fly back and forth repeatedly in a figure-eight pattern, while facing the entrance to the nest. In some cases, after this second flight the wasp will have gathered all of the knowledge necessary to fly off. Other wasps must make a third orientation flight that is like the second one. At first, the worker may miss the entrance to the nest many times; however, after six to twelve trips, the wasp gains its bearings; flights become longer, and reentry into the colony becomes more precise.|$|E
