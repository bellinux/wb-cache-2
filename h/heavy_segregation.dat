5000|$|By 1835, massive {{plantations}} {{began to}} grow in large scales on the islands. To {{keep up with the}} increasing demand for labor, the plantation owners began to import workers in 1865. Immigrant workers and their families flooded in from China, Korea, Portugal, the Philippines, Puerto Rico, and Japan. Company recruits were extremely selective in their choosing of workers. Educations was of no value to them, and conditions in Hawai’i where no better. The companies owned all living quarters and stores nearby the plantations, keeping the workers isolated {{from the rest of the}} island. All of the camps were racially segregated adding further isolation of the workers. The companies also had close ties with the utility companies and government officials. To help keep wages low, the companies would pay all utilities, health care, fuel, and more. Their relations with the government also kept legislation in favor of the workers from passing. The field managers were all armed, would ride on horseback carrying whips, and would follow the workers relentlessly. With such poor living condition, low pay, demanding labor, and harsh oppression, strike would often spring up. However, because of the <b>heavy</b> <b>segregation,</b> the strikes mainly consisted of one ethnicity and were extremely unorganized, thus always doomed to fail. [...] Fortunately, massive change and organization was right around the corner. In 1935, the National Labor Relations Act was passed, allowing for legal union organization in United States territories. Soon after the passing of the law, labor activists began to enter Hawai’i to help organize its workers. On August 1, 1938 members of the International Longshore and Warehouse Union (ILWU), along with several other unions, organized a strike protesting for better wages and a union shop against launderers, auto dealers, warehouses, and vessels. Out of the 200 peaceful protesters that gathered, 50 of them were injured in attempts by police to make them disband. When tear gas, bayonets, and hoses failed, the police resorted to using firearms on the unarmed protesters. This tragic day became known as the “Hilo Massacres” or “Hawaii’s Bloody Monday” and led to further organization around the islands.|$|E
40|$|Abstract: A failure {{investigation}} for a diesel engine crankshaft {{has been conducted}} which was used for truck in this paper, which is made from 42 CrMo steel. The fracture occurred on the crank web between the 4 th crankpin and the 4 th journal, the fracture section indicates that fatigue is the dominant mechanism. The dimensions, chemical compositions of material and surface hardness were evaluated {{in order to find}} the failure causes. Chemical compositions, the depth of hardness layer and surface hardness are qualified; however, there are transition zone of hardness layer on the journal boss fillet, the dimensions of journal boss is not qualified, it less than specified dimension, and many non-metallic inclusions aggregate zones and <b>heavy</b> <b>segregation</b> were found from metallographic photo, these would reduce the tensile strength. FEA analysis is also used to analysis the strength of this crankshaft, and the results suggest that the dimension of journal boss fillet is the key dimension, which has an important effect on the strength of the crankshaft. So the disqualified machining dimensions, material property are the main reasons for the fraction of this crankshaft...|$|E
40|$|A hyperthermal seedable {{supersonic}} beam, {{specifically designed}} for the deposition of thiophene based oligomers, is presented. The beam's properties are characterized by time-of-flight mass spectrometry and photoionization spectroscopy. Several quaterthiophene (T 4) films under different beam conditions have been prepared and characterized by optical absorption, fluorescence spectroscopy and scanning electron microscopy. Centreline <b>heavier</b> species <b>segregation</b> in the beam is exploited to grow T 4 films efficiently from impurities present in raw terthiophene (T 3) powders. The morphology {{and structure of the}} films can be controlled by the beam's parameters that in turn allow variation in flux density, energy and orientation of molecules in the beam...|$|R
5000|$|On 15 January 1999 the Račak {{massacre}} {{occurred when}} [...] "45 Kosovan Albanian farmers were rounded up, led {{up a hill}} and massacred". The bodies had been discovered by OSCE monitors, including Head of Mission William Walker, and foreign news correspondents. Yugoslavia denied a massacre took place. The Račak massacre {{was the culmination of}} the KLA attacks and Yugoslav reprisals that had continued throughout the winter of 1998-1999. The incident was immediately condemned as a massacre by the Western countries and the United Nations Security Council, and later became the basis of one of the charges of war crimes leveled against Milošević and his top officials. This massacre was the turning point of the war. NATO decided that the conflict could only be settled by introducing a military peacekeeping force under the auspices of NATO, to forcibly restrain the two sides. Pristina, the capital of Kosovo, had been subjected to <b>heavy</b> firefights and <b>segregation</b> according to OSCE reports.|$|R
40|$|Despite {{being one}} of the world’s wealthiest {{countries}} and most modern economies, in Switzerland gender equality remains an elusive challenge. Paid maternity leave, legal abortion and an increase in women’s educational attainment are some of the milestones achieved since 1995, when the country was one of 189 states to adopt the Beijing Declaration and Platform for Action at the Fourth World Conference on Women. But while legal gender equality may be nearly achieved, much remains to be done to achieve gender equality in practice. Rigid gender stereotypes, wage discrimination, women’s <b>heavy</b> care burden, <b>segregation</b> in the workplace, violence against women, under-representation of women in political and economic decision making, and structural obstacles to reconciling family duties with employment still {{stand in the way of}} gender equality. In order to realize gender equality, government, employers, politicians and civil society all need to take concrete and coordinated actions. These range from changes in the educational sector, in the labour market and in the social security system to an active foreign policy that promotes women’s human rights...|$|R
40|$|When DNA is {{extracted}} from Chinese hamster cells {{grown in the}} presence of 5 -bromodeoxyuridine {{from the beginning of the}} S (synthesis) phase until the middle of the first replication round, a significant fraction of total replicated DNA bands at intermediate densities between light-light and light-heavy DNA, in a CsCl gradient. Incomplete bromodeoxyuridine substitution compared with light-heavy DNA justifies the displaced banding of these molecules. Since "intermediate DNA" following alkaline or thermal denaturation gives rise to unsubstituted and fully substituted single strands, its particular density in neutral gradients cannot be ascribed to a uniformly reduced degree of bromodeoxyuridine substitution nor to covalently joined light and <b>heavy</b> strands. The <b>segregation</b> of DNA of intermediate densities into light-light and light-heavy components after shearing suggests that it includes at least one junction between replicated and still unreplicated segments, i. e. one replication fork that may or may not have lost one of its prongs. DNA of intermediate density specifically contains one to two sites sensitive to breakage by Neurospora crassa endonuclease. When a two-minute pulse of tritiated bromodeoxyuridine is given during replication in unlabelled heavy medium, the DNA fragments (mol. wt 35 × 106) containing labelled segments band essentially at intermediate positions and are progressively converted to light-heavy molecules, with increasing duration of chase. The half-life of this pulse-labelled intermediate DNA (about 25 min) is consistent with the proportion of total replicated DNA found at displaced densities (10 to 15 %) and, together with the distribution of the intermediate radioactivity, is compatible with the existence of adjacent growing replicons. If DNA is labelled and extracted during the second replication round {{in the presence of}} bromodeoxyuridine, "intermediate DNA" with similar properties is found between the light-heavy and heavy-heavy peaks. © 1974.
