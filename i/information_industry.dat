500|$|The {{game was}} {{criticized by the}} South China Morning Post for lacking documentation, making it more {{difficult}} to learn how to play the game. They also predicted that players would be unhappy with the game's speed, as time {{plays an important role in}} earning money from tenants. Before the player can purchase new facilities, a long period of time must pass before income is earned from tenants. The newspaper was also unhappy with complaints from tenants; specific reasons for their dissatisfaction are never given. The Age was disappointed by the lack of pre-built towers and scenarios, suggesting that one along the lines of The Towering Infernos plot could have been included. Game Informer referred to SimTower as a [...] "lesser-known" [...] simulation game, and described it as [...] "fun and addictive". Writing for the San Diego Union-Tribune, Matt Miller felt that, when compared to SimCity 2000 (1993), gameplay in SimTower moved slowly. He also disliked the moments when he had to wait several minutes to pass by before he could make enough money to purchase new additions for his building. Dragon magazine's reviewers Jay and Dee praised the visuals and gameplay. However, the two commented that the game can feel slow because it lacks gameplay elements and options present in other strategy games.

2500|$|In the 21st century, though {{women still}} face some degrees of {{discrimination}} in the Japanese job market, {{there have been a}} number of companies that both foster women's equality and reward them on a talent based system. [...] New fields, such as banking, journalism, insurance sales, and advertising; companies in the <b>information</b> <b>industry,</b> are very appealing to women, because they reward them based on individual ability.

[...] Aside from the <b>information</b> <b>industry,</b> several foreign companies have taken an interest in Japan. [...] The companies provide Japanese women, who have some foreign language proficiency, work in challenging fields with pay comparable to their male counterparts. [...] Women also have a better chance of promotion to managerial positions in foreign companies and are hired based on their skills, rather than potential abilities that can be mastered through on the job training, as is popular with Japanese firms.

In <b>information</b> technology <b>industries,</b> start-up and growth of venture businesses are active because venture businesses can flexibly adapt to and cope with technical and market changes. Second, the <b>information</b> technology <b>industry</b> requires lean production since the consumers’ demands are diverse and unequal.

Third, the <b>information</b> technology <b>industry</b> has a lower entry barrier in fixed assets especially {{in the area of}} instruments, accessories, software, and contents.
