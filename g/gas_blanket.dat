40|$|This thesis {{consists}} of two parts. In {{the first part of}} the thesis, the Rayleigh-Taylor and the Kelvin-Helmholtz instabilities of a cylindrical interface between two inviscid fluids or two viscous fluids are analyzed from first principles (momentum and continuity equations). Dispersion equations, relating wavenumber, k, to growth rate, G, were derived for various conditions. Application of the dispersion equations to film boiling on a cylindrical heater and to breakup of a liquid film around a cylindrical body led to the development of mathematical models for the prediction of the dominant wavelengths formed during these processes for both inviscid and viscous fluids. Experiments were carried out to measure the dominant unstable wavelength during the breakup of a liquid film around a cylindrical body. It was found that the dominant wavelength decreased with a decrease in the radius of the cylindrical body in agreement with the present theory and in contradiction to previously published work. In another application of the present theory, the breakup of a cylindrical liquid-in-gas jet and a cylindrical gas-in-liquid jet was analyzed based on the Kelvin-Helmholtz instability. It was predicted that the dominant wavelength decreased rapidly with an increase in the jet velocity. In the second part of the thesis, gas injection through a very narrow slot into a liquid is examined extensively. A modified bubble formation model is proposed taking into consideration the surface tension force and the inertial force. When gas was injected into liquid through a very narrow slot (50 - 250 $ mu$m), three different bubbling regimes were found as the flow rate of gas was increased. They were: regular bubble regime at low flow rates, coalescence bubble regime at medium flow rates, and gas globe regime at high flow rates. The gas-dispersion characteristics of each of the regimes were discussed and mathematically analyzed. In the regular bubble regime, the bubble formation was dominated by both surface tension force and inertial force. In the coalescence bubble regime, the formation of bubbles was dominated by inertial forces only. In the gas globe regime, due to the Rayleigh-Taylor instability, multiple bubbles were formed at separate nodes of a continuous <b>gas</b> <b>blanket</b> extending the length of the slot. The critical transition condition between the regular bubble formation regime and the coalescence bubble regime is given...|$|E
40|$|A fiber-optic {{sensor system}} has been {{developed}} that can remotely measure the concentration of molecular oxygen (O 2), nitrogen (N 2), hydrocarbon vapor, and other gases (CO 2, CO, H 2 O, chlorofluorocarbons, etc.) in the ullage of a liquid-fuel tank. The system provides an accurate and quantitative identification of the above gases with an accuracy of better than 1 percent by volume (for O 2 or N 2) in real-time (5 seconds). In an effort to prevent aircraft fuel tank fires or explosions similar to the tragic TWA Flight 800 explosion in 1996, OBIGGS are currently being developed for large commercial aircraft to prevent dangerous conditions from forming inside fuel tanks by providing an inerting <b>gas</b> <b>blanket</b> that is low in oxygen, thus preventing the ignition of the fuel/air mixture in the ullage. OBIGGS {{have been used in}} military aircraft for many years and are now standard equipment on some newer large commercial aircraft (such as the Boeing 787). Currently, OBIGGS are being developed for retrofitting to existing commercial aircraft fleets in response to pending mandates from the FAA. Most OBIGGS use an air separation module (ASM) that separates O 2 from N 2 to make nitrogen-enriched air from compressed air flow diverted from the engine (bleed air). Current OBIGGS systems do not have a closed-loop feedback control, in part, {{due to the lack of}} suitable process sensors that can reliably measure N 2 or O 2 and at the same time, do not constitute an inherent source of ignition. Thus, current OBIGGS operate with a high factor-of-safety dictated by process protocol to ensure adequate fuel-tank inerting. This approach is inherently inefficient as it consumes more engine bleed air than is necessary compared to a closed-loop controlled approach. The reduction of bleed air usage is important as it reduces fuel consumption, which translates to both increased flight range and lower operational costs. Numerous approaches to developing OBIGGS feedback-control sensors have been under development by many research groups and companies. However, the direct measurement of nitrogen (N 2) is a challenge to most OBIGGS ullage sensors (such as tunable diode laser absorption) as they cannot measure N 2 directly but depend on the measurement of oxygen (O 2). The problem with a singular measure of O 2, is that as the concentration (number density) of O 2 decreases due to the inerting process or due to lower pressures from high altitudes, the precision and accuracy of the O 2 measurement decreases. However, measuring O 2 density in combination with N 2 density (which is more abundant in air and in a N 2 -inerted fuel tank) can provide a much more accurate and reliable determination of the OBIGGS efficacy...|$|E

40|$|A brief {{review of}} {{plutonium}} oxidation literature was conducted. The purpose of the review was to ascertain the effect of oxidation conditions on oxide morphology to support the design and operation of the PDCF direct metal oxidation (DMO) furnace. The interest in the review was due to a new furnace design that resulted in oxide characteristics that are different {{than those of the}} original furnace. Very little of the published literature is directly relevant to the DMO furnace operation, which makes assimilation of the literature data with operating conditions and data a convoluted task. The oxidation behavior can be distilled into three regimes, a low temperature regime (RT to 350 C) with a relatively slow oxidation rate that is influenced by moisture, a moderate temperature regime (350 - 450 C) that is temperature dependent and relies on more or less conventional oxidation growth of a partially protective oxide scale, and high temperature oxidation (> 500 C) where the metal autocatalytically combusts and oxidizes. The particle sizes obtained from these three regimes vary with the finest being from the lowest temperature. It is surmised that the slow growth rate permits significant stress levels to be achieved that help break up the oxides. The intermediate temperatures result in a fairly compact scale that is partially protective and that grows to critical thickness prior to fracturing. The growth rate in this regime may be parabolic or paralinear, depending on the oxidation time and consequently the oxide thickness. The high temperature oxidation is invariant in quiescent or nearly quiescent conditions due to <b>gas</b> <b>blanketing</b> while it accelerates with temperature under flowing conditions.

40|$|Greenhouse <b>gases</b> {{naturally}} <b>blanket</b> the Earth {{and keep}} it about 33 degrees Celsius warmer {{than it would be}} without these gases in the atmosphere. This is called the Greenhouse Effect. Over the past century, the Earth has increased in temperature by about. 5 degrees Celsius and many scientists believe this is because of an increase in concentration of the main greenhouse gases: carbon dioxide, methane, nitrous oxide, and fluorocarbons. People are now calling this climate change over the past century the beginning of Global Warming. Fears are that if people keep producing such gases at increasing rates, the results will be negative in nature, such as more severe floods and droughts, increasing prevalence of insects, sea levels rising, and Earth's precipitation may be redistributed. These changes to the environment will most likely cause negative effects on society, such as lower health and decreasing economic development. However, some scientists argue that the global warming we are experiencing now is a natural phenomenon, and is part of Earth's natural cycle. Presently, nobody can prove if either theory is correct, but one thing is certain; the world has been emitting greenhouse gases at extremely high rates and has shown only small signs of reducing emissions until the last few years. After the 1997 Kyoto Protocol, the world has finally taken the first step in reducing emissions. The Greenhouse Effect The "greenhouse effect " is the heating of the Earth due to the presence of greenhouse gases. It is named this way because of a similar effect produced by the glass panes of a greenhouse. Shorter-wavelength solar radiation from the sun passes through Earth's atmosphere, then is absorbed by the surface of the Earth, causing it to warm. Part of the absorbed energy is then reradiated back to the atmosphere as long wave infared radiation. Little of this long wave radiation escapes back into space; the radiation cannot pass through the greenhouse gases in the atmosphere. The greenhouse gases selectively transmit the infared waves, trapping some and allowing some to pass through into space. The greenhouse gases absorb these waves and reemits the waves downward, causing the lower atmosphere to warm. (www. eb. com: 180...|$|R

Flow of the aerosol over deserts and industrial belts is a practical example of such a condition, where the thermal radiation emanating from the surface, affects the flow mechanism of the aerosol transport. The emphasis of the present study is only on carbon-black solid particles of a size in the nanometer range present in atmospheric air. The aerosol is treated as nanofluid for the numerical simulation. A comprehensive study on the controlling parameters that affect the flow and heat transfer characteristics are delineated. The governing equations are solved using modified MAC method and SIMPLER algorithm has been used to solve pressure velocity coupling employing relaxation technique. The transport equation for surface radiation is solved using the net radiation method. The cross string method is used to evaluate the view factor. The most striking result is that the heat transfer rate increases with increase in the volume fraction of the carbon-black particles, which has an adverse effect on both the climate and living creatures. The results are presented in tabular and graphical form. The heat transfer and flow characteristics are depicted in the form of isotherms and streamlines revealing the physics of this complex phenomenon...|$|R
40|$|Flammability {{limit is}} a most {{significant}} property of substances to ensure safety of chemical processes and fuel application. Although there are numerous flammability literature data available for pure substances, for fuel mixtures these are not always available. Especially, for fuel mixture storage, operation, and transportation, inert <b>gas</b> inerting and <b>blanketing</b> have been widely applied in chemical process industries while the related date are even more scarce. Lower and upper flammability limits of hydrocarbon mixtures in air with and without additional nitrogen were measured in this research. Typically, the fuel mixture lower flammability limit almost keeps constant at different contents of added nitrogen. The fuel mixture upper flammability limit approximately linearly varies with the added nitrogen except mixtures containing ethylene. The minimum added nitrogen concentration at which lower flammability limit and upper flammability limit merge together is the minimum inerting concentration for nitrogen, roughly falling into the range of 45 plus/minus 10 vol % for all the tested hydrocarbon mixtures. Numerical analysis of inert gas dilution effect on lower flammability limit and upper flammability limit was conducted by introducing the parameter of inert gas dilution coefficient. Fuel mixture flammability limit can be quantitatively characterized using inert gas dilution coefficient plus the original Le Chatelier's law or modified Le Chatelier's law. An extended application of calculated adiabatic flame temperature modeling was proposed to predict fuel mixture flammability limits at different inert gas loading. The modeling lower flammability limit results can represent experimental data well except the flammability nose zone close to minimum inerting concentration. Le Chatelier's law is a well-recognized mixing rule for fuel mixture flammability limit estimation. Its application, unfortunately, is limited to lower flammability limit for accurate purpose. Here, firstly a detailed derivation was conducted on lower flammability limit to shed a light on the inherent principle residing in this rule, and then its application was evaluated at non-ambient conditions, as well as fuel mixture diluted with inert gases and varied oxygen concentrations. Results showed that this law can be extended to all these conditions...|$|R
40|$|Absorption-stripping with aqueous 2 -amino- 2 -methyl- 1 -propanol (AMP), and {{especially}} AMP blends with other amines, such as monoethanolamine (MEA) and piperazine (PZ), presents an attractive option for carbon dioxide (CO 2) capture from flue gas in coal-fired power plants. Alkanolamine based solvents degrade in this service. The {{purpose of this}} work was to investigate AMP solvent degradation under thermal and oxidizing conditions, to measure rates of degradation for comparison with other solvents, to identify the degradation products and to identify possible degradation pathways. 5 mol/kg AMP without CO 2 loading was thermally stable up to 140 °C under a <b>blanket</b> <b>gas</b> of N 2, exhibiting very low loss rates. However, with an initial CO 2 loading of 0. 15 and 0. 3 mol CO 2 /mol AMP at 135 °C, AMP lost 3. 8 (mol) % and 5. 5 (mol) % after 5 weeks, respectively. The steric hindrance in AMP molecule slows down CO 2 induced degradation of AMP as compared to MEA, {{but it does not}} prevent oxazolidinone formation and oxazolidinone ring-opening into further degradation products. The rate of oxidative degradation of AMP was investigated over a range of temperature, CO 2 loading, and AMP concentration. At 100 to 140 °C, degradation was found to be O 2 mass transfer limited in the employed batch reactors, however, the degradation rate increased with CO 2 loading. No significant effect of pH value was observed on the AMP degradation rate. Acetone, 2, 4 -lutidine, 4, 4 -dimethyl- 2 -oxazolidinone and formate were the main identified degradation products. Oxidative degradation of AMP likely proceeds through a Habstraction step followed by production of a peroxyl radical. The peroxyl radical is proposed to decompose to primary products by intramolecular H-abstraction via a six-membered cyclic transition sate. The reactions of AMP and the primary degradation products lead to the final degradation products. Acetone oxime and 4, 4 -dimethyl- 1, 3 -oxazolidine were minor products at 100 - 140 °C, but they were major products at 80 °C. Temperature significantly affects the distribution of the ultimate degradation products. UV radiation with a medium mercury lamp can dramatically accelerate the oxidation of AMP at 55 °C. It seems that UV radiation does not change the primary degradation mechanism of AMP. The degradation products of UV accelerated oxidation are different from those of thermally accelerated oxidation of AMP, probably due to the impact of temperature on the secondary reactions of the primary products. AMP oxidation is proposed to be initiated by a radical mechanism, but the reaction is not a chain reaction. The degradation rate of 1. 5 mol/kg PZ is 1. 2 mmol/(kg·h) within 19 days, which is approximate half of that of 5 mol/kg AMP under 250 kPa O 2 and at 100 °C. A possible degradation pathway of PZ is proposed based on the identified products. The degradation rate of AMP in AMP/PZ blends is close to that in a single AMP system, however, PZ degraded faster in the blends than it degraded individually at identical degradation conditions. As compared to degradation of single MEA and AMP solvents, no new product was found in the degraded AMP/MEA mixture without CO 2 loading. Increasing the initial MEA concentration in the mixture, the amount of AMP loss decreased indicating that MEA protects AMP from oxidation. This inhibition effect of MEA on AMP degradation could be {{due to the fact that}} MEA degrades faster than AMP in the blends...|$|R
