40|$|Abstract. In {{this paper}} we present the {{analysis}} of M 1. 8 class (GOES SXR) limb <b>flare</b> and associated post <b>flare</b> loops of 2 May, 2001 which erupted on the west limb in NOAA 9433 (N 15, W 88). The <b>flare</b> started at around 00 : 32 UT from a small mound of twisted loops. When we started Hct. observations at 0052 UT the <b>flare</b> was in decay phase enveloped by highly shearedltwisted post <b>flare</b> loops which we call as primary post <b>flare</b> loops. The unique feature of this <b>flare</b> was that {{a new system of}} loops were developed when the primary loops were almost decaying. We call these newly formed loops as secondary loops. The main aim of the paper is to study the dynamics of the Ha flarelpost <b>flare</b> loops and to understand how the magnetic field gets relaxed from highly shearedltwisted stage to a simplified potential field. We have discussed the nature of temporal behavior of the temperature and emission measure of the <b>flare.</b> The post <b>flare</b> condensation and formation of secondary loops has also been studied in this paper. The <b>flare</b> was also associated with SXR, HXR and IvIW emissions...|$|R
40|$|The World Bank has set 2030 as {{the year}} for the {{cessation}} of routine natural gas <b>flaring</b> in countries concerned. Nigeria {{is among the most}} consistent natural gas <b>flaring</b> nations on earth and natural gas <b>flaring</b> remains an intractable negative externality for approximately six decades of crude oil exploration in the country. With a focus on the long run, we employ the Autoregressive Distribution Lag bounds test to cointegration approach to search for the determinants of natural gas <b>flaring</b> in Nigeria using secondary data from 1984 - 2013. Empirical result identified natural gas <b>flaring</b> penalty, crude oil production, natural gas price, natural gas marketization and lack of natural gas infrastructure as fundamental determinants of natural gas <b>flaring</b> in Nigeria. Crude oil production contributed the highest to the increase in natural gas <b>flaring</b> while natural gas marketization has the greatest impact on gas <b>flaring</b> abatement. The key conclusion from this paper is that the implementation of policies targeting optimal natural gas <b>flaring</b> can result in natural gas <b>flaring</b> mitigation in the long run and put Nigeria on the path towards meeting the 2030 World Bank deadline on cessation of routine natural gas <b>flaring...</b>|$|R
5|$|Over {{the course}} of the next week, the US troops were able to discern the North Koreans' system of attack and use it to their advantage. The North Koreans used a system of <b>flares</b> to signal various actions and {{coordinate}} them. It quickly became apparent to the defending Americans that green <b>flares</b> were used to signal an attack on a given area. So the 27th Infantry obtained its own green <b>flares</b> and then, after the North Korean attack had begun, fired them over its main defensive positions. This confused the attacking forces and often drew them to the points of greatest US strength where they suffered massive casualties from defensive machine-gun crossfire. The US troops also began using land mines in front of their positions to stall the North Koreans. The mines stopped the tanks and the infantry tried to remove them. When this happened, US troops fired <b>flares</b> to illuminate the scene and pre-registered artillery and mortar fire blasted the immobilized North Koreans. This tactic was effective in inflicting further significant casualties.|$|E

40|$|MasterExtreme Ultraviolet Lithography (EUVL) {{is one of}} {{the leading}} {{candidates}} for the next generation lithography of 32 nm half pitch technology and beyond. But there are still many problems to be solved before its introduction to mass production. One of the critical issues in EUVL is <b>flare</b> ffect, which is related to the unwanted scattering light. It degrades the contrast of aerial images and the control of the critical dimension (CD) across the exposure field. Therefore, it is necessary to predict accurate <b>flare</b> value and compensate it before destored pattern is printed on a wafer. Mathematically, <b>flare</b> is obtained by convolution of the <b>flare</b> point spread function (PSF) with a clear-field mask. Because the region of <b>flare</b> PSF expends several millimeters, trade-off between resolution and computer resources exists when one calculates <b>flare</b> value. To circumvent this problem, we defined a critical region of PSF and found the relationship between accuracy and grid size of PSF. In this paper, we studied on <b>flare</b> PSF and <b>flare</b> value for various patterns and investigated a smart way to obtain an accurate <b>flare</b> map especially at the edge area of pattern where the gradient of <b>flare</b> value is high, using a fractal model of <b>flare</b> PSF for Alpha demo tool (ADT). Moreover we proposed a mask level compensation strategy for <b>flare</b> value correction.

5|$|A {{significant}} portion of the game takes place underwater. Some pools are inhabited by piranhas that can kill Lara within seconds, while others have streams with currents that can pull her in a fixed direction, preventing the player from being able to swim back or grab onto a ledge. Furthermore, the water in the Antarctica levels is too cold for Lara to swim through {{for more than a few}} seconds. The player can also wade through quicksand, but at the risk of drowning Lara. Some levels require the player to use vehicles. For example, the kayak helps Lara fight her way down rapids in the Madubu Gorge level, while an underwater propeller unit allows her to explore deep water areas in the Lud's Gate level. Other vehicles include a quad bike, a boat, and minecarts. <b>Flares</b> may be used to explore darkened areas. Ammunition, <b>flares,</b> and health recovery items are dispersed among the levels to help players increase their resources. The game also features a tutorial level where the player can practice Lara's moves and combat abilities.|$|E

40|$|We present SDO/AIA {{observations}} of an eruptive X-class <b>flare</b> of July 12, 2012, and compare its evolution with {{the predictions of}} a 3 D numerical simulation. We focus on the dynamics of <b>flare</b> loops that are seen to undergo slipping reconnection during the <b>flare.</b> In the AIA 131 A ̊ observations, lower parts of 10 MK <b>flare</b> loops exhibit an apparent motion with velocities of several tens of km s− 1 along the developing <b>flare</b> ribbons. In {{the early stages of}} the <b>flare,</b> <b>flare</b> ribbons consist of compact, localized bright transition-region emission from the footpoints of the <b>flare</b> loops. A DEM analysis shows that the <b>flare</b> loops have temperatures up to the formation of Fe XXIV. A series of very long, S-shaped loops erupt, leading to a CME observed by STEREO. The observed dynamics are compared with the evolution of magnetic structures in the “standard solar <b>flare</b> model in 3 D”. This model matches the observations well, reproducing both the apparently slipping <b>flare</b> loops, S-shaped erupting loops, and the evolution of <b>flare</b> ribbons. All of these processes are explained via 3 D reconnection mechanisms resulting from the expansion of a torus-unstable flux rope. The AIA observations and the numerical model are complemented by radio observations showing a noise storm in the metric range.

40|$|In the {{framework}} of solar flare/coronal mass ejection theory, we propose a theoretical model for magnetar giant <b>flare,</b> which can explain the <b>flaring</b> activity on 2004 December 27 from SGR 1806 - 20 comprehensively. As {{is the case with}} solar <b>flare,</b> explosive magnetic reconnection in magnetosphere takes {{a major role in the}} energetics of magnetar <b>flare.</b> However, cooling and energy transport processes in magnetar <b>flare</b> differ from those in solar <b>flare</b> essentially. In the magnetar <b>flare,</b> radiative cooling determines the <b>flare</b> temperature. Furthermore, released magnetic energy is transported by photon flux unlike electron heat conduction in solar <b>flare.</b> Then incident heat flux drives the baryonic mass evaporation from the crustal surface of magnetar. We find that the temperature and evaporating baryonic mass in <b>flaring</b> activity of magnetar are described by simple scaling relations. Applying the magnetic reconnection model to the giant <b>flare</b> on 2004 from SGR 1806 - 20, the difference of the released energy between preflare and main burst phases is explained by the volume difference of the active region. In addition, our model predicts that the evaporating bayonic matter in the preflare phase is the origin of the expanding ejecta observed in assocication with the giant <b>flare</b> from SGR 1806 - 20.
