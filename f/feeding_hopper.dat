The system is basically formed of a cylindrical chamber comprising two levels of fluid bed distributor plates. The performance of the system was addressed. Repeatability experiments were performed in order to check out {{for the possibility of}} solids feeding control through a sphere valve which controls the air feed rate. Silica sand particles of three different size were used, with mean diameters of 152, 287 and 484 µm. Experiments showed that the total particulate discharge depends on the primary air feeding rate, the distance between the exit of the <b>feeding</b> <b>hopper</b> and the primary air distributor plate, and the particulate diameter, but independs on the secondary air feeding rate. The system was observed to be of difficult control and showed poor repeatability. However, the system was found to be an excellent device for distributing the flow of solids throughout several discharge sections. For the operational conditions considered and air volumetric flowrates above 3 × 10 - 3 m³/s the deviation on the particulate mass flowrate through a given discharge section related to the average value through the four sections of the injector was always below 5 %...|$|E

40|$|Roller {{compaction}} is {{a continuous}} dry granulation process for producing free flowing granules {{in order to}} increase the bulk density and uniformity of pharmaceutical formulations. It is a complicated process due to the diversity of powder blends and processing parameters involved. The properties of the produced ribbon are dominated by a number of factors, such as the powder properties. friction, roll speed, roll gap, feeding mechanisms and feeding speed, which consequently determine the properties of the granules (size distribution, density and flow behaviour). It is hence important to understand the influence of these factors on the ribbon properties. in this study, an instrumented roller press developed at the University of Birmingham is used to investigate the effect of lubrication on the density distribution of the ribbons. Three different cases are considered: (1) no lubrication, (2) lubricated press. in which the side cheek plates of the roller press are lubricated, and (3) lubricated powder, for which a lubricant is mixed into the powder. In addition, how the powders are fed into the entry region of the roller press and its influence on ribbon properties are also investigated. It is found that the method of feeding the powder into the roller press plays a crucial role in determining the homogeneity of the ribbon density. For the roller press used in this Study, a drag angle (i. e., the angle formed when the powder is dragged into the roller press) is introduced to characterise the powder flow pattern in the <b>feeding</b> <b>hopper.</b> It is shown that a sharper drag angle results in a more heterogeneous ribbon. In addition, the average ribbon density depends upon the peak pressure and nip angle. The higher the peak pressure and nip angle are, the higher the average ribbon density is. Furthermore, the densification behaviour of the powder during roller compaction is compared to that during die compaction. It has been shown that the densification behaviour during these two processes is similar if the ribbons and the tablets have the same thickness. (C) 2008 Elsevier B. V. All rights reserved. ...|$|E
40|$|Fundamental level {{understandings}} on {{the processing}} behaviours of materials in granular and powder form is of high interest to number of engineering industries for example, mining, mineral, pharmaceutical, geotechnical and for advanced material processing applications. Handling and processing of pharmaceutical powders through confined geometries have {{very important role}} in pharmaceutical industry and many related powder process engineering sectors. Smooth flow of powders and granules mixtures from the <b>feeding</b> <b>hopper</b> to the compression chamber plays a very crucial role to achieve the integrity {{and quality of the}} final product. In this context, establishing clear understandings on the flow and compaction characteristics of particulates is vital. The mechanical behaviour of particulate materials such as powders and grains are different from the conventional states of matter. Depending on the loading levels and geometrical conditions, often they display combined features of solid, liquid and gaseous states. Though an extensive amount of studies are reported in the existing literatures on their mechanical response to loading, there are still a number of challenges to address: (i) Sensing stress distribution in particulate systems is not yet established especially when the size of the particulates are less than a millimetre (ii) Understanding is lacking on whether the stress distribution in initial static filling would influence the dynamic flow trajectories of the particulates when they are allowed to flow from the static state (iii) Micromechanical behaviour of particulates under low levels of external loading is still lacking and (iv) Interaction characteristics of stress and velocity distributions in particulate systems as a function of grain-scale properties and geometrical arrangements are still lacking. The present thesis addresses all of these important challenges in a systematic manner. The research is primarily based on the application of sensing stresses and displacements in particulates using advanced photo stress analysis tomography (PSAT), qualitative velocimetry using colour coding technique (CCT) and quantitative digital particle image velocimetry (DPIV). The required grain-scale properties are characterised comprehensively using a number of standard experimental methods. Where possible, experimental results on the stress and velocity distribution for particulate systems are compared with simulations using discrete element method (DEM) and analytical equations respectively, though the primary focus is on the experimental approaches. A number of outcomes from this research shed new lights and provide fundamental level understandings on the micromechanical properties of particulate systems with relevance to pharmaceutical granules processes. ...|$|E

40|$|This {{investigation}} was into {{the processing of}} long, fine Australian cotton in high-mass throughput saw gins. The research was conducted at the Auscott Narrabri gin in New South Wales, Australia using Australian cotton with a UHML of 30. 9 mm and 31. 8 mm, with a micronaire value of 3. 85. Mass production rates trials ranged between 3200 and 3800 kg/h of lint. In particular, the feed and discharge of seed was investigated, and the results demonstrate that the gin stand motor load frequently fluctuates due to the varying mass input of seed cotton. Furthermore, the distribution of seed cotton presented to the gin stand is laterally non-uniform. It is thought that a non-uniform vertical feed results in elevated nep and seed-coat nep due to the changing seed-roll density. The source of the uneven lateral distribution of seed cotton to the gin stand lies within the design of distributor conveyor, which feeds seed cotton to the gin stand. Because of the high speed required to transport seed cotton in the conveyor distributor, the drop zone of seed cotton to each <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> is overshot. The trailing edge of the hopper is further seed cotton deficient. The auger blade together with the auger housing create a nip point allowing for the seed cotton to be {{pulled out of the}} <b>feed</b> <b>hopper.</b> Methods to overcome the problem were trialled,, including redirecting the seed cotton on the gin stand apron, modifying the conveyor distributor, and increasing the seed cotton mass in the affected areas to improve the uniformity of the seed roll density. The uneven input of seed cotton creates an uneven output of fuzzy seed. The region of the gin stand most affected was the corresponding delivery side. This output region expelled up to four times more fuzzy seed than other expulsion areas of the gin stand. The uneven fuzzy seed expulsion is attributed to the seed roll density, as the roll box is unevenly loaded with incoming seed cotton. Uneven loading of seed cotton creates areas within the roll box that experience a reduction in density, and this creates a movement of fuzzy seed from high-density areas to the neighbouring lower-density areas. Therefore, high levels of fuzzy seed expulsion occur in areas of lesser density. The output distribution curve of fuzzy seed equates approximately to the inverse curve of the seed cotton input. Elongation of the leading and trailing edge angle on the hopper of the gin stand was not finalised because of time constraints. This method is believed to enable the elimination of the uneven seed roll. The elongation length may be required up to 60 cm. Overcoming the uneven vertical flow can be achieved through electrical settings of the <b>feed</b> <b>hopper</b> motor. Eliminating the uneven lateral feed has the potential to increase production by approximately 12 per cent. It is envisaged that tight seed roll occurrence will reduce with an evenly loaded seed roll, further increasing productivity. Saw blade wear should also reduce, together with the event of fires as a result of tight seed rolls. Roll box geometry was also investigated, and this highlighted frictional properties, mechanical interaction of the saw teeth, and seed roll densities. Decreasing the time that the seed cotton is present in the roll box would reduce mechanical interaction. Further, the lint mass production rate was investigated, and results indicated that reducing mass production rates decreased nep and seed-coat nep because of a decrease in the seed roll density. Research was conducted on Continental Eagle 161 gin stands. ...|$|R
