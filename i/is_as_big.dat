He bursts into the {{presence}} of Julius Caesar and tells the emperor that only the wild man of the woods can interpret the dream that has been troubling him. Later, he returns {{in the form}} of a black, shaggy man, barefoot, with a torn coat. In another episode, he decides to do something that will be spoken of forever. Going into the forest of Brocéliande, he transforms himself into a herdsman carrying a club and wearing a wolf-skin and leggings. He is large, bent, black, lean, hairy and old, and his ears hang down to his waist. His head <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as a buffalo's, his hair is down to his waist, he has a hump on his back, his feet and hands are backwards, he is hideous, and is over 18 feet tall. By his arts, he calls a herd of deer to come and graze around him.|$|E

Atwell stated that [...] "seeing 50 with Dre and Em having his back <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> a visual {{statement}} {{as it is a}} musical statement" [...] and the shot was significant because it made clear the club was inside the center and not unrelated performance footage. On January 27, 2003, the video debuted on MTV's Total Request Live at number nine and stayed on the chart for fifty days. It also reached number one on the MuchMusic video charts. At the 2003 MTV Video Music Awards, the video was awarded Best Rap Video and Best New Artist and was nominated for Video of the Year, Best Male Video, and Viewer's Choice.

500|$|Writing about cricket in Trinidad, {{historian}} C. L. R. James {{noted that}} Dewhurst always kept wicket [...] "excellently", but that many Trinidadians considered Piggott a better wicket-keeper {{who was only}} left out because he was black and Dewhurst was white. James recalled that people were astonished when Piggott was not chosen to tour England in 1923. But he suggests {{it was not a}} surprise as without Dewhurst's selection, among the Trinidad representatives on the West Indian team, {{there would have been no}} players from the Queen's Park Club, the most prestigious club on the island, nor would there have been any white players. Writing in 1927, in the expectation that Dewhurst would tour England the following year, his 1923 team-mate C. R. Browne wrote that Dewhurst's [...] "heart <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> as his body" [...] and that his [...] "expansive smile captures many victims". He described him as [...] "very unassuming, but winning in appearance Dewhurst is effective in his job and inspires confidence in bowler and fieldsmen alike.

Despite these plot-related issues, both reviewers gave the performance an [...] "A", and Benigno noted both that [...] "he nails it" [...] and [...] "last half of the song is a singing clinic." [...] VanDerWerff was not fond of the reliance on [...] "gimmicky staging", though Futterman called it [...] "an impressive physical performance", Votta stated that [...] "Kurt sounds flawless and the performance is captivating" [...] and Flandez complimented his [...] "captivating high notes after high notes", and added, [...] "He's a star unicorn, and he knows it."

Packard et al. (2009) tested dinosaur mass estimation procedures on elephants and concluded that those of dinosaurs are flawed and produce over-estimations; thus, the weight of Tyrannosaurus, as well as other dinosaurs, could have been much less. Other estimations have concluded that the largest known Tyrannosaurus specimens had masses approaching or exceeding 9 tonnes.|$|E
500|$|In its year end {{review of}} albums {{released}} in 2015, Rolling Stone ranked Rebel Heart at number 45 noting: [...] "How {{did it take}} this long for Madonna to write herself a theme song titled 'Unapologetic Bitch'? No apologies offered or needed—Rebel Heart was the queen's finest album in a decade, picking up the disco-stick baton of her 2005 Confessions on a Dance Floor as Madonna voyages back into the groove and reflects on where she's been lately". It was also listed at number six on its ranking of the 20 Best Pop Albums of 2015. Similarly, in its year end review, Spin magazine listed the album at number 21 as Andrew Unterberger noted that: [...] "For most artists who spent whole decades defining the mainstream, titling an album Rebel Heart would seem misguided at best, but for Madonna, it's truer now than ever: A fifty-something refusing to bend to public demands about how she should age gracefully... <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> an act of defiance as you can stage in contemporary pop music". AllMusic called Rebel Heart {{as one of their}} Favorite Pop Albums of 2015, describing it as: [...] "Bold, messy, and life-affirming record that finds Madonna simultaneously looking forward and back".|$|E

2500|$|The Anonymous Conqueror wrote, They {{lead him}} to the temple, where they dance and carry on joyously, and the man about to be {{sacrifice}}d dances and carries on like the rest. At length the man who offers the sacrifice strips him naked, and leads him at once to the stairway of the tower where is the stone idol.

Soon comes the sacrificing priest--and this is no small office among them--armed with a stone knife, which cuts like steel, and <b>is</b> <b>as</b> <b>big</b> {{as one of our}} large knives. He plunges the knife into the breast, opens it, and tears out the heart hot and palpitating. And this as quickly as one might cross himself. At this point the chief priest of the temple takes it, and anoints the mouth of the principal idol with the blood; then filling his hand with it he flings it towards the sun, or towards some star, if it be night. Then he anoints the mouths of all the other idols of wood and stone, and sprinkles blood on the cornice of the chapel of the principal idol. Afterwards they burn the heart, preserving the ashes as a great relic, and likewise they burn the body of the sacrifice, but these ashes are kept apart from those of the heart in a different vase.|$|E
