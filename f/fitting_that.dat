25|$|The ear phones {{received}} overall highly positive reviews. However, {{they were}} described as offering method of <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> might be uncomfortable to some listeners.|$|E
25|$|Glowing though Charlton’s praise is, it {{was somehow}} <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> Juventus {{provided}} {{the most moving}} tribute when their former talisman died in 2004.|$|E
25|$|Charleston {{provided}} a large fraction of privateering activity, {{and it is}} <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> the fates of {{three of them were}} particularly important in its early demise. The three vessels were Petrel, Jefferson Davis, and Savannah.|$|E
5000|$|Avoid {{installing}} <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> {{may cause}} non-uniform flow, {{such as an}} elbow, mitred elbow, or square duct.|$|R
5000|$|Swaged seals, {{tubes are}} {{connected}} with <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> are swaged permanently in place. Primarily used in aircraft.|$|R
5000|$|Technicians can {{manually}} adjust robotic tool travel speed, orientation, and configuration {{to navigate}} <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> might trap or damage a free-flowing pig.|$|R
25|$|The {{debate about}} the {{definition}} of a fitting saddle is still controversial; however, there is a general rule for <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> no damage should occur to the horse's skin and no injury should be presented to any muscular or neural tissues beneath the saddle.|$|E
25|$|Arizona State did score {{one more}} {{touchdown}} {{later in the}} fourth quarter, making the score its final 35–23. In a game which Rudy Carpenter was sacked 9 times, it seemed only <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> the last {{play of the game}} was a sack as time ran out.|$|E
25|$|If {{data are}} {{represented}} by a statistical model specifying a particular family of probability distributions, then estimates of the median {{can be obtained by}} <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> family of probability distributions to the data and calculating the theoretical median of the fitted distribution. Pareto interpolation is an application of this when the population is assumed to have a Pareto distribution.|$|E
50|$|Electrofusion is {{a method}} of joining MDPE, HDPE and other plastic pipes using special <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> have {{built-in}} electric heating elements which are used to weld the joint together.|$|R
5000|$|Tap {{is used in}} the British Isles {{and most}} of the Commonwealth for any {{everyday}} type of valve, particularly the <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> control water supply to bathtubs and sinks.|$|R
50|$|<b>Fittings</b> <b>that</b> are {{not allowed}} to slip are made to diameters that prevent {{slipping}} and consequently the mating surfaces cannot be brought into position without force. For small bearings this is best done with a press because tapping with a hammer damages both bearing and shaft, while for large bearings the necessary forces are so great that there is no alternative to heating one part before <b>fitting,</b> so <b>that</b> thermal expansion allows a temporary sliding fit.|$|R
25|$|Traditional Maya religion, though also {{representing}} a belief system, {{is often referred}} to as costumbre, the 'custom' or habitual religious practice, in contradistinction to orthodox Roman Catholic ritual. To a large extent, Maya religion is indeed a complex of ritual practices; and it is, therefore, <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> the indigenous Yucatec village priest is simply called jmen ("practitioner"). Among the main concepts relating to Maya ritual are the following ones.|$|E
25|$|The {{parallel}} mount {{accepts a}} solid bar {{parallel to the}} drum shell. There are many bar sizes and profiles, mostly either round and knurled or hexagonal. There is a some compatibility, {{but it is not}} universal. Some manufacturers such as Tama Drums and Gibraltar Hardware even produce a single <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> can be used either singly as a hanging tom mount, or in sets of three to attach the floor tom legs.|$|E
25|$|Although he {{had fallen}} on {{financial}} hard times, Barton S. Tibbits {{lived long enough to}} see his dream survive and prosper. It is only <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> upon his death, his memorial service would be held on the very stage that he erected at his own sacrifice for the benefit of Coldwater and the wider community's citizens. His funeral was held August 27, 1889. The opera house also offered memorial services for President McKinley.|$|E
5000|$|Soleno Inc. {{produces}} {{high-density polyethylene}} resin pipes used for storm drains and <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> are shipped throughout Atlantic Canada. The plant employs 25 individuals. In 2013 the New Brunswick government invested $125,000 in payroll rebates to help replace its assembly line to keep production going ...|$|R
5000|$|The term [...] "bracket" [...] {{refers to}} the tube <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> are used to hold frame tubes {{together}} in lugged steel frames which also form the shell that contains the spindle and bearings; the terms is since used for all frames, bracketed or not.|$|R
50|$|The {{memorial}} {{is divided}} into two exhibition halls. The lower hall displays most of his personal belongings during his reign as Chief Minister of Malacca, Minister and Deputy Prime Minister. The upper hall displays his various souvenirs, photos, books, television set, furniture and <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> were used by him and his family.|$|R
25|$|On 6 October 1997, WA Transport Minister Eric Charlton {{announced}} that the $400m Northern City Bypass would be named the Graham Farmer Freeway. Charlton said, “He already has a place in WA sporting folklore and it is <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> a showpiece of the city’s transport network should bear his name… The northern traffic bypass system links West Perth and East Perth which are, coincidentally, the two districts which Graham Farmer represented with distinction on the football arena”.|$|E
25|$|There {{were two}} {{principal}} types of GFM cloche, {{each with a}} set of subtypes. The 1929 Type A cloche was the initial model, with a short variant, a longer version, a wider version, and a model that could accommodate two soldiers. The 1934 Type B cloche was larger in diameter, with thicker armor. The gun ports were redesigned to fire through a ball <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> was more resistant to opposing fire. Some Type A cloches were fitted with the new ports.|$|E
25|$|In February 2011 it was {{announced}} that Ronaldo would be given one last match for Brazil, a friendly against Romania in São Paulo on 7 June 2011, five years after his last match with the national team. Despite it being almost unheard of in international football for players to be given a farewell match for their national side, Brazilian Football Confederation officials stated that given the extraordinary career of Ronaldo, it was only <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> his final game should take place in Brazil while representing his nation.|$|E
5000|$|... {{the use of}} quick-connector {{systems has}} become more popular. These are <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> screw into the common hose connectors, {{allowing}} hoses and accessories to be easily connected together using a snap-fit system. The style manufactured by Gardena is common, imitated by and compatible with many other manufacturers. The connectors may also include an internal valve that is opened by the <b>fitting,</b> so <b>that</b> disconnecting a hose using this adaptor causes the water flow to stop. This greatly eases common tasks by allowing specialized sprayers to be interchanged without requiring two trips back to the spigot for each change.|$|R
50|$|Liquid hoses for LPG are {{specifically}} designed and rated for the pressures that exist in LPG systems, and are made from materials designed to be compatible with the fuel. Some hoses are made with crimped fittings, while others are made using re-usable <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> are pressed or screwed onto {{the end of the}} hose.|$|R
500|$|After the {{locomotive}} {{returned to the}} Smithsonian, it remained on static display. [...] In 1930 the museum commissioned the Altoona Works to build a second replica of {{the locomotive}}'s tender for display with the locomotive in the museum. This time, however, the replica tender re-used some of the <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> the museum had retained when the original tender was dismantled twenty years earlier.|$|R
25|$|Michigan also {{enjoys a}} {{spirited}} rivalry with the Notre Dame Fighting Irish. Michigan leads the series 24–17–1. The two schools {{are among the}} top college football programs in all-time wins (Michigan first, Notre Dame third) and winning percentage (Michigan first, Notre Dame second) in the NCAA Division I Football Bowl Subdivision (formerly Division I-A), so it is perhaps <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> when college football was in its infancy, students from the University of Michigan traveled to South Bend to teach the game to students there.|$|E
25|$|After {{the police}} arrive, Archie notices that an object has been stashed {{in the pocket}} of his topcoat. Concerned that he's being set up, Archie escapes the {{premises}} without examining the object. Back at Wolfe's house, the object is found to be a bloodstained fencing glove, in which a col de mort has been wrapped. A col de mort, it turns out, is a sharp metal <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> can be attached to the end of an épée, so as to turn a relatively safe weapon into a deadly one.|$|E
25|$|Furthermore, Scotus {{said that}} Mary was {{redeemed}} {{in anticipation of}} Christ's death on the cross. This {{was similar to the}} way that the Church explained the Last Supper, since Roman Catholic theology teaches that the Mass is the sacrifice of Calvary made present on the altar, and Christ did not die before the Last Supper. Scotus' defence of the immaculist thesis was summed up by one of his followers as potuit, decuit ergo fecit – God could do it, it was <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> He did it, and so He did it.|$|E
50|$|Compared to pipe <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> are {{themselves}} threaded, banjo fittings {{have the advantage}} {{that they do not}} have to be rotated relative to the host fitting. This avoids risk of damage by twisting the hose when screwing the fitting into place. It also allows the pipe exit direction to be adjusted relative to the fitting, then the bolt tightened independently.|$|R
50|$|St. Andrew's Church in Aysgarth was {{substantially}} rebuilt in 1536, {{and restored}} in 1866. It {{is now a}} Grade II* listed building. The unusually large churchyard extends to about four acres. The church preserves a number of <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> were rescued from Jervaulx Abbey {{at the time of}} the Dissolution of the Monasteries, including a rood screen and the abbot's stall.|$|R
25|$|In 1901, the hobble skirt was introduced; a tight <b>fitting</b> skirt <b>that</b> {{restricted}} a woman's stride.|$|R
25|$|For {{the rest}} of the 1911 season and through to her final voyage in the fall of 1912, the Inlander was piloted by Captain John Bonser. It was <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> Bonser would pilot the last sternwheeler on the Skeena River, as he had pioneered it twenty years earlier in 1892 for the Hudson's Bay Company in the Caledonia, naming many of the rapids and canyons along the route. The Inlander would be the last of many notable riverboats under Bonser's command, among them, the Nechacco and the Northwest.|$|E
25|$|In the {{championship}} round each board was worth money, beginning at $200 and increasing by $100 {{for each additional}} board until someone won the game. Each board had a specific category for it and six words <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> category on it. Henry read a clue {{for one of the}} words, and the first contestant to buzz in and correctly locate it was given twenty seconds to find the other five words. Doing so won the value of the board, but if the contestant could not do this the opposing contestant got a chance to steal by finding just one of the remaining words within five seconds. Doing so won the opponent the money attached to the board; otherwise, the money stayed with the first contestant.|$|E
25|$|The {{nation was}} still young indeed {{even after the}} end of the Civil War: California had only {{recently}} become a State, committing to the side of the victorious Union and contributing its men though the conflict took place mainly across the continent, thousands of miles away. It was then only <b>fitting</b> <b>that</b> to California the Fraternities should next have moved. Pioneers in many initiatives, Zeta Psi was the first fraternity west of the Mississippi river and hence also the first to establish a chapter on the West Coast: in 1870 it established the Iota chapter at the University of California, Berkeley. (Though the Iota chapter would not be joined until 1892 by the next addition, the Mu chapter at Stanford University).|$|E
40|$|What is the {{relation}} between virtue and wellbeing? Our claim is that, under certain conditions, virtue necessarily tends {{to have a positive}} impact on an individual’s wellbeing. This is so because of the connection between virtue and psychological happiness, on the one hand, and between psychological happiness and wellbeing, on the other hand. In particular we defend three claims: that virtue is constituted by a disposition to experience <b>fitting</b> emotions, <b>that</b> <b>fitting</b> emotions are constituents of <b>fitting</b> happiness, and <b>that</b> <b>fitting</b> happiness is a constituent of wellbeing. What follows is that, under certain conditions, virtue disposes the individual to experience wellbeing-constituting states. We end with a discussion of two objections that may be raised against our proposal...|$|R
50|$|Opened on 29 June 1960. It was {{designed}} as a drama studio and had panels and <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> made it customised. The walls were slightly thicker in an attempt to insulate it from noise from the Hammersmith & City line of the London Underground. It housed the first programme and was the first studio to be completed. It was upgraded to colour in 1969. It will reopen on 1 September 2017.|$|R
60|$|She passively assented, and he {{took her}} round. There was not much to show in such a bare {{skeleton}} of a house, but he {{made the most of}} it, and explained the different ornamental <b>fittings</b> <b>that</b> were soon to be fixed here and there. Lucy made but few remarks in reply, though she seemed pleased with her visit, and stole away down the ladder, followed by her companions.|$|R
