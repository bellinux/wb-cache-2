40|$|AbstractA {{method has}} been {{developed}} to determine experimental <b>equilibrium</b> <b>distillation</b> curves using a modified ASTM D 86 distillation apparatus. The method determines accurate equilibrium initial boiling points and accounts for the dynamic holdup inherent in distillation curves measured {{in accordance with the}} ASTM D 86 standard. In this work, the ASTM D 86 distillation setup has been modified to simultaneously measure liquid and vapor temperature using two resistance temperature detectors (RTDs) and a data acquisition system has been employed to record temperature data at one-second time intervals for the duration of each distillation. Additionally, the time for each volume recovery point is recorded. The method presented here uses the time-resolved liquid temperature data to identify the true initial boiling point (IBP) of four fuel mixtures of known composition; the IBPs are within 2 °C of the calculated equilibrium values. The time-resolved volume recovery information and the identified initial boiling point time are used to construct a volume evaporated versus time curve. The measured temperatures determined at the corresponding volume evaporated increments provide an experimental <b>equilibrium</b> <b>distillation</b> curve (EEDC). The EEDCs for the four fuel mixtures of known composition match the calculated equilibrium curves within a few degrees Celsius; a maximum mean absolute error of 2. 2 ± 1. 4 °C was observed. The dynamic holdup (volume difference between volume evaporated and volume recovered) associated with a distillation is found to correlate with the initial boiling point of the fuel being distilled and the temperature of the condenser bath used in the experiment. The method was also applied to measure EEDCs for a gasoline fuel and a diesel fuel, where the compositions were unknown, to investigate the differences between the EEDCs and the ASTM D 86 distillation curves. The results highlight the large errors incurred when using ASTM D 86 results to approximate <b>equilibrium</b> <b>distillation</b> curves...|$|E
40|$|Biorefinery {{processing}} of biofuel and chemical production from biomass faces several challenges. Factors that inversely affect {{the production of}} bioethanol by fermentation include toxicity to the microorganism by high ethanol concentration during processing. The removal of ethanol by distillation involves operating at a high temperature, which damage the microorganisms with high energy consumption. Bio-oil is a complex mixture containing thermally unstable components. Furthermore, bio-oil characterised by high water content, acidity and other properties that setup many obstacles in its applications. In addition, in solvent extraction of biomass lipid components, the solvent is usually retrieved by distillation. Due to the high temperature during the process, the lipid and biomass components may be degraded. In the current study, microbubble distillation has been introduced as a novel technology for separation of a thermally sensitive mixture. The {{results showed that the}} microbubble distillation has achieved higher separation efficiency compared to that obtained with fine bubble distillation. Thereafter, microbubble distillation has been applied to separate ethanol and water mixtures. The study showed that the liquid level and air temperature could be engineered to achieve high separation efficiency compared to that obtained from an idealised <b>equilibrium</b> <b>distillation</b> stage, while the liquid mixture temperature was far from the mixture's boiling point. Microbubble distillation also has been applied to upgrade a simulated bio-oil mixture. The mixture was contained water, acetic acid, cyclohexanone, and salicylaldehyde. Post-treatment, it was shown that the mixture was free of water and 86...|$|E
40|$|Since {{distillation}} {{is still}} the most widely used separation technique used in the petrochemical industry, optimisation of these unit operations are important to minimise costs and maximise production. This thesis focuses on the development of a tool using rigorous non-equilibrium distillation models to optimise complex columns. Non-equilibrium distillation models are usually avoided in optimisation studies due to the time required to solve them, but this has been overcome by using a technique called orthogonal collocation in which the profiles in the columns are represented by polynomials of a lower order than would be required normally. This significantly reduces the process times and makes the use of non-equilibrium models a possibility in optimisation studies. The orthogonal collocation technique was applied to a packed distillation column model and shown to be effective in modelling the system. A system consisting of a distillation column with integrated external side reactors was chosen as a case study to investigate the use of the methods. These systems {{have been shown to be}} effective in certain circumstances in literature, when comparing them to other forms of process intensification, such as reactive distillation. The toluene disproportionation reaction was considered as a potential use for the technology and the optimisation tool was used to find optimum system configurations for achieving maximum toluene conversions and minimum costs. Nonlinear programming techniques were used initially to optimise these systems, but due to the discontinuities associated with multiple side streams, they were replaced by a genetic algorithm. Various system configurations were identified as achieving maximum conversions and minimum costs. These results were used in a comparison with results obtained from a literature study and the results showed significant promise. Unfortunately, the two studies did not have enough in common to truly produce a comprehensive result. This iv lead to further comparisons with another system using the same information. The results obtained in the toluene disproportionation case study showed that there was some possible benefits for using the side reactor systems, but the conventional system was still 30 and 60 % cheaper in terms of capital and utility costs respectively. Another case study was investigated that looked at the synthesis of methyl acetate from acetic acid and methanol. The packed collocation model was used as a comparison with another investigation performed in literature (using <b>equilibrium</b> <b>distillation</b> models). Both showed comparable results, but still had significant differences. Costs were also compared between the side reactor system and a more conventional system for methyl acetate synthesis. The side reactor systems were found to be more cost effective than the conventional system. Additionally, an increase in the number of external reactors resulted in lower utility costs (mainly as a result of lower flow rates in the side streams). Overall, the reaction and process conditions are important considerations when deciding whether or not to use a side reactor system. For the gas phase toluene disproportionation reaction, the side reactor systems were not cost effective, when compared to the conventional system. However, the liquid phase methyl acetate reaction proved to be more conducive to side reactor systems in terms of cost. This thesis has shown the applicability of using rigorous disequilibrium distillation models in optimisation studies. The side reactor systems have been found to be complex systems that require a holistic approach to find optimum configurations instead of optimising individual process units...|$|E

40|$|A {{tool for}} the order {{reduction}} of differential algebraic equations (DAEs) is outlined in this report. Through {{the use of an}} equation dependency analysis and nonlinear function approximation, the algebraic equations can be divided into sets that require implicit or explicit solutions. If all of the algebraic variables can be solved or approximated explicitly, the DAE becomes a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs). As a test case for the theory, a dynamic <b>equilibrium</b> binary <b>distillation</b> column model is analyzed with the generalized approach. The index 1 DAE model of 52 differential and 233 algebraic states is reduced to an ODE set of 26 differential states.

40|$|A {{comparison}} of various process configurations {{was made for}} the production of 2 -methoxy- 2, 4, 4 -trimetylpentane which is a promising gasoline component owing low solubility to water and high octane value. The ether is synthesised by reacting methanol with a mixture of 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 1 -pentene and 2, 4, 4 -trimethyl- 2 -pentene, which are obtained in a large scalefrom the dimerisation of isobutene. The reaction equilibria were determined experimentally at temperature range 323 - 383 K in liquid phase using a commercial cation exchange resin Amberlyst 35 as catalyst. A first order kinetic model was developed and utilised in the process simulations. The production of the ether was found to inefficient in a once throug tubular reactor, because the conversion is stronly limited by the reaction <b>equilibrium.</b> Reactive <b>distillation</b> increases the conversion considerably...|$|R
40|$|A {{model for}} the {{transfer}} of mass and thermal energy in a vapour-liquid region is used to investigate the influence of neglecting coupling on the transfer rates. As an example, we studied a nitrogen-oxygen distillation column. Using a combination of stage and point boundary conditions, a nitrogen transfer profile is obtained that shows the same trend as a profile based on an <b>equilibrium</b> stage <b>distillation</b> model. The distribution of the total transfer over the two column halves is not in agreement, however. This disagreement {{can be expected to}} decrease when the dependency of the vapour film thickness on the vapour flow rate and the vapour viscosity is included in the model. The effect of neglecting coupling on the calculated transfer rates changes {{along the length of the}} column. The total effect is considerable and should be taken into account in models for the transfer of mass and thermal energy through an interface...|$|R
40|$|In this dissertation, the {{influence}} of equilibrium chemical reactions on vapor-liquid <b>equilibrium</b> and <b>distillation</b> processes is studied. The theory of reactive-phase diagrams for two-phase systems, in which the components undergo one equilibrium chemical reaction, is developed, and the conditions for reactive-azeotropy are derived. It is shown that reactive-azeotropes do not necessarily correspond to stationary points in the chemical equilibrium surfaces. Reactive-phase diagrams, which illustrate {{the influence}} of chemical reactions on phase equilibria, are computed for some typical systems. These diagrams show that reactive-azeotropes can occur even for ideal mixtures. ^ The effect of <b>equilibrium</b> reactions on <b>distillation</b> processes is illustrated by studying the simple distillation of homogeneous reactive mixtures. The residue curve maps for some typical systems show that by allowing the components of a mixture to react we can either create or eliminate simple distillation boundaries. Moreover, the addition of reaction may prevent some non-reactive azeotropes from being obtained as products of the distillation process. ^ The study of the simple distillation of reactive mixtures led {{to the definition of}} a set of transformed composition variables that reduce the conservation equations for reactive mixtures to a form identical to that for non-reactive mixtures. These variables are used to simplify the design equations for single- and double-feed reactive distillation columns. These variables also allow the derivation of simple relationships between the dependent design variables, which are not evident when mole fractions are used. ^ The new design equations are used to devise a technique for the calculation of minimum reflux ratios in single- and double-feed multicomponent reactive distillation columns. The design of reactive distillation columns for commercially important non-ideal mixtures is considered. The application of the results of this work to the synthesis of flow sheets for processes using reactive distillation is discussed. ...|$|R

40|$|This work {{is focused}} on {{thermodynamic}} modelling of isobaric vapour-liquid-liquid equilibrium (VLLE) (homogeneous) and (heterogeneous) for binary, ternary and quaternary systems. This work uses data for organic/aqueous systems; historically these mixtures {{were used in the}} production of penicillin and were required to be separated by continuous fractional distillation. Modelling of the separation required phase equilibrium data to be available so that predictions could be made for equilibrium stage temperatures, vapour compositions, liquid compositions and any phase splitting occurring in the liquid phase. Relevant data became available in the literature and work has been carried out to use relevant theories in correlating and predicting as was originally required in the <b>distillation</b> <b>equilibrium</b> stage modelling. All the modelling carried out was at atmospheric pressure. The modelling has been done using an Equation of State, specifically Peng Robinson Styrjek Vera (PRSV), combined with the activity coefficient model UNIversal QUAsi Chemical (UNIQUAC) through Wong Sandler mixing rules (WSMR). The success of all correlations and predictions was justified by minimizing the value of the Absolute Average Deviation (AAD) as defined within the thesis. Initially the integral Area Method and a method called Tangent Plane Intersection (TPI) were used in the prediction of liquid-liquid equilibrium (LLE) binary systems. This work used a modified 2 -point search, suggested a 3 -point search and has successfully applied both of these methods to predict VLLE for binary systems. It was discovered through the application of the TPI on ternary VLLE systems that the method was strongly sensitive to initial values. This work suggested and tested a Systematic Initial Generator (SIG) to provide the TPI method with realistic initial values close to the real solution and has demonstrated the viability of the SIG on improving the accuracy of the TPI results for the ternary systems investigated. In parallel with the TPI another method the Tangent Plane Distance Function (TPDF) was also investigated. This method is based on the minimisation of Gibbs free energy function related to the Gibbs energy surface. This method consistently showed it was capable of predicting VLLE for both ternary and quaternary systems as demonstrated throughout this work. The TPDF method was found to be computationally faster and less sensitive to the initial values. Some of the methods investigated in this work were also found to be applicable as phase predictors and it was discovered that the TPDF and the SIG methods were successful in predicting the phase regions; however the TPI method failed in identifying the 2 phase region. Applying the techniques described to newly available quaternary data has identified {{the strengths and weaknesses of}} the methods. This work has expanded the existing knowledge and developed a reliable model for design, operation and optimisation of the phase equilibria required for prediction in many separation processes. Currently available modelling simulation packages are variable in their predictions and sometimes yield unsatisfactory predictions. Many of the current uses of VLLE models are particularly focused on Hydrocarbon/Water systems at high pressure. The work described in this thesis has demonstrated that an EOS with suitable mixing rules can model and predict data for polar organic liquids at atmospheric and below atmospheric pressure and offers the advantage of using the same modelling equations for both phases...|$|R
40|$|The {{first part}} of this study is {{concerned}} with setting up a reactive distillation process for production of tert-amyl-methyl ether (TAME). This work was linked to the development of etherification technology of Neste Oy. TAME production makes possible to upgrade some low value olefinic components to high value gasoline. Moreover, it has a significant impact in the reduction of the air pollution caused by the cars by introducing oxygen to the gasoline. However {{at the time of the}} study, there was no technology available for production of that component. Reactive distillation (RD) had been applied successfully to the production of the tert-butyl-methyl-ether (MTBE). Thus it seemed worth of trying to apply RD to TAME production as well. The actual work of setting up the process was accomplished using a simulation model of a reactive distillation column. Arrangement of the column and conditions of the experimental runs were determined with the model developed earlier by Aittamaa and Kettunen (1993). The pilot run was successful, so that ethers could be produced as planned and experiments verified with the existence of the operating regimes predicted by the model. The results of this study had a significant impact on the development of the highly successful NExTAME and NExETHERS technologies, even if the final solution was based on the Side Reactor Concept (SRC), i. e. a combination of a distillation column and a reactor connected to the column via side streams, rather than on RD. The second part is the development of a rate-based model of a reactive distillation column including the effects of incomplete lateral mixing on the trays. Most published tests with RD have been performed with small pilot or bench scale columns. In such columns vapour and liquid mixing is nearly complete. However, that is not the case in large industrial columns. On the other hand, making tests with reactive system in columns having diameter of two meter or more is very expensive and practically impossible for most research institutions. Not only the sheer size and utility consumption of such devices are large, but the feed and product volumes are huge even for a short run. With non-reacting systems it is often possible to recycle the products back to the feed, but when reaction takes place, that is much more difficult. If lateral mixing is suspected to have importance in some particular case, a mathematical model is probably the only viable way to estimate its significance before the full-scale plant is built. Two different models for the effects of the lateral concentration profiles on reactive distillation trays were developed. The first model is an eddy diffusion model, the other one is a mixed pool model of reactive distillation trays. The basic principles of both models are known already earlier but both include novel features. Similar models have not been applied earlier to the reactive distillation. The eddy diffusion equations are solved simultaneously and rigorously with the other equations of the equation group describing the column, instead of using solutions of strongly idealized problem as an approximation as has been usual with non-reactive distillation columns separating nearly ideal mixtures. The mixed pool model differs from the ones presented earlier with its ability to take different mixing cases of the vapour phase into account. The normal assumption has been that the vapour is fully mixed between the column trays. Here is presented a simple and efficient method for treating columns with unmixed vapour flow from tray to tray. Two types of the liquid flow are considered – liquid flow to same direction on adjacent trays or liquid flow to contrary directions on adjacent trays. In the third part a development of a combined model for SRC system is presented. When the SRC was found to be very useful in etherification processes, it was considered useful to develop a dedicated modelling tool for it. The part of the model describing the distillation column is in principle an <b>equilibrium</b> stage reactive <b>distillation</b> column model. The part of the model describing the side reactor(s) consists of a series of reactor segments. Each reactor segment is considered internally fully mixed, but using sufficient number of such segments in series, a plug flow reactor can be modelled with good accuracy. There is a significant flexibility in structure of the reactor sequence. The reactor system may operate in vapour or liquid phase or in co-current two-phase mode. Intercoolers or heat flows between surroundings and the reactor segments can be used. As examples of the application of this model a case study of comparing SRC and RD in the production of tert-amyl-methyl-ether (TAME) and diisobutene is presented. The study showed that SRC optimisation of the reaction conditions is of crucial importance to the performance of the process. The developed model was proofed to be an efficient tool for this purpose. The fourth part of this work was a part of development work of a novel tower packing by Sarvis Oy, The packing is continuously manufactured with the name HUFO. The results of the experimental work performed during the development project were used in order to develop an interfacial area correlation for a packed bed. This correlation attempts to take the structural detail of the packing into account by introducing the width of the surface elements of the packing type into the correlation. In most correlations the specific surface and nominal size of the packing have been used for this purpose. However, the development of random packings has gone towards more and more heavily perforated shapes. The actual width of the packing walls interacting with the fluids in a bed consisting of some modern packing of certain nominal size is very different from the nominal diameter. Thus various correlations based on different combinations of the specific surface and of the width of the packing surface elements were tried. The best fit between the correlation and the test results was achieved when only the width of the surface elements was used in the correlation. Another important result for practical chemical engineering is the observation that wettability of the plastic packing, known to be an important factor affecting the efficient interfacial area was greatly improved by the thin film of impurities deposited on the packing surface during the test program. The same thing may happen in industrial applications as well where impurities are common and run times long. Thus in many cases the efficiency correlations developed using brand new packings may be overly conservative. reviewe...|$|R
