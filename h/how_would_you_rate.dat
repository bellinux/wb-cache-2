It may be formulated as “in general, {{would you say}} that you health is excellent, very good, good, fair, or poor?” as the first question in the SF-36 questionnaire. It may also be formulated as “In general, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rate</b> your health today,” with the possible choices being “very good” (1), “good” (2), “moderate” (3), “bad” (4) or “very bad” (5)” as used by the World Health Organization.

5000|$|Using {{data for}} 426 {{instructors}} at the University of Maine, researchers {{examined the relationship}} between RateMyProfessors.com (RMP) indices and formal in-class student evaluations of teaching (SET). The two primary RMP indices correlate substantively and significantly with their respective SET items: RMP overall quality correlates r = [...]68 with SET item, Overall, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rate</b> the instructor?; and RMP ease correlates r = [...]44 with SET item, How did the work load for this course compare to that of others of equal credit? Further, RMP overall quality and RMP ease each correlates with its corresponding SET factor derived from a principal components analysis of all 29 SET items: r = [...]57 and [...]51, respectively. Leading to the author's conclusion [...] "While these RMP/SET correlations should give pause to those who are inclined to dismiss RMP indices as meaningless, the amount of variance left unexplained in SET criteria limits the utility of RMP.".|$|E

3000|$|The {{dependent}} variable {{for this study}} is an index of key performance indicators (KPIs) of the healthcare system in Alberta. These indicators reveal a single underlying construct measuring public perceptions of healthcare (see Northcott and Harvey, 2012 for details). The KPIs index consists of five general indicators assessing the availability, accessibility, and perceived quality of healthcare services, overall quality of the healthcare system, and satisfaction with the health system in Alberta. Four of these KPIs were measured on a 4 -point scale and one (satisfaction) on a 5 -point scale. Availability was measured by asking the respondents, “Overall, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rate</b> the availability of health care services in your community?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]poor, 4 [*]=[*]excellent). Accessibility {{was measured by the}} question, “How easy or difficult is it for you to get the health care services you need when you need them?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]very difficult, 4 [*]=[*]very easy). Perceived quality of the healthcare services was measured by the question, “Overall, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rate</b> the quality of health care services that are available in your community?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]poor, 4 [*]=[*]excellent). Quality of the healthcare system was measured by the question, “Thinking now about the health care system in Alberta, overall, <b>how</b> <b>would</b> <b>you</b> <b>rate</b> it?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]poor, 4 [*]=[*]excellent). Satisfaction with the health system was measured by the question, “Overall, how satisfied are you with the health system in Alberta?” (coded 1 [*]=[*]very dissatisfied, 5 [*]=[*]very satisfied). Northcott and Harvey (2012) utilized the same sample used in this study and reported a Cronbach’s alpha value of [...]. 84 for the KPIs index, indicating good internal consistency for this measure.|$|E
