5|$|Although {{he signed}} a new {{contract}} with Southport, Brodie signed for their National League rivals Aldershot Town on 14 August 2015 on a one-year contract. He debuted the following day as a 58th-minute substitute in a 3–0 away defeat to Wrexham, but started the following match, a 1–1 home draw with Dover Athletic, in which he scored Aldershot's equalising goal on 36 minutes from a Jim Stevenson pass. Having scored five goals from 26 appearances, Brodie left Aldershot by mutual consent on 29 January 2016, so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> closer to home for family reasons. A day later, he joined National League North club Stockport County and played for them on a part-time basis. Brodie scored on his debut with a close-range header in Stockport's 2–1 away defeat to Harrogate Town on 2 February 2016. He scored four goals from 13 appearances as Stockport ranked ninth in the National League North. He was released by the club in May 2016.|$|E
5|$|The use {{of black}} and white line art for the game's {{graphics}} was an attempt to differentiate it from other games and catch the interest of gamers. Implementing it presented some challenges for the design staff. The design of Qbby, the player character, came after the idea of creating boxes was established; he was designed from a functional perspective. At one point in development, while brainstorming BoxBoy!s visual style, the team had considered making Kirby the main character. It become difficult trying to make Kirby, a round character, look natural in the box-producing action, so they settled with a character that had a square-shaped body, the same as the boxes. Feet were added to Qbby so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> and jump, and eyes were added so the player could recognise which direction he was facing. Since Qbby had a simple design, the team focussed on making his animations expressive to ensure the character was engaging and had a personality.|$|E
25|$|Initially <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> freely around town. His brother George and {{his cousin}} Grand Duke Dimitri Konstantinovich had also been exiled to Vologda and they visited each other frequently. Allowed to do as he pleased {{so long as he}} {{remained}} within the city limits, the grand duke occupied his time reading.|$|E
60|$|Duane {{tried to}} speak. His lips were weak, and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> {{scarcely}} <b>move</b> them.|$|R
60|$|Jimmy drank, gasped, {{and tried}} to get up, but found <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>move.</b>|$|R

25|$|It was {{morning and}} Belacqua {{was stuck in}} the first of the canti in the moon. He was so bogged that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> neither {{backward}} nor forward. Blissful Beatrice was there, Dante also, and she explained the spots on the moon to him. She shewed {{him in the first place}} where he was at fault, then she put up her own explanation. She had it from God, therefore he could rely on its being accurate in every particular.|$|E
25|$|Morgenthau {{used his}} {{position}} as Treasury chief to investigate organized crime and government corruption. Treasury Intelligence and other agencies (the notoriously fragmented US federal law enforcement system had five in the Treasury Department alone) were uncoordinated in their efforts; efforts to create a super-agency were stalled by J. Edgar Hoover, who feared his FBI would be overshadowed. Nevertheless, Morgenthau created a coordinator for the Treasury agencies; although the coordinator could not control them, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> them to some cooperation.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, Khosrow sent an army under Golon Mihran to Armenia, but {{the latter}} was {{defeated}} in Taron by the Armenian rebel leader Vardan III Mamikonian, who captured his war elephants as war booty. Sometime later, however, Golon Mihran managed to seize Angl. During the same time, the Siunian prince Vahan asked for Khosrow's permission that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> his court from Dvin to the capital of Paytakaran, a region in eastern Armenia. Furthermore, Vahan also requested that Paytakaran should be merged with the Atropatene province. Khosrow accepted, and did what he asked.|$|E

60|$|I looked {{round at}} Brother John. He had heard {{something}} and was utterly overcome. Fortunately enough <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>move</b> or even speak.|$|R
60|$|Gerald stood transfixed, {{his soul}} echoing in horror. He would <b>move,</b> but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not. <b>He</b> <b>could</b> not <b>move</b> his limbs. His brain seemed to re-echo, like a pulse.|$|R
25|$|Because of the {{disposition}} of his divisions, to save time, Warren sent Ayres's division to support Sheridan first. Warren's message to Meade about this change and the unlikelihood <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> against the Confederate flank and rear {{because of the large}} Confederate force at Gravelly Run near Dr. Boisseau's house was delayed due to a break in the telegraph line. Warren's implementation of his orders was delayed due to the availability of only six staff officers that night. Further delays were encountered by the need for to keep the movements of the V Corps from the Union line quiet to avoid Confederate attack from the nearby White Oak Road line.|$|E
25|$|In {{the wake}} of Nur ad-Din's death, Saladin faced a {{difficult}} decision; <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> his army against the Crusaders from Egypt or wait until invited by as-Salih in Syria {{to come to his}} aid and launch a war from there. He could also take it upon himself to annex Syria before it could possibly {{fall into the hands of}} a rival, but he feared that attacking a land that formerly belonged to his master—forbidden in the Islamic principles in which he believed—could portray him as hypocritical, thus making him unsuitable for leading the war against the Crusaders. Saladin saw that in order to acquire Syria, he either needed an invitation from as-Salih, or to warn him that potential anarchy could give rise to danger from the Crusaders.|$|E
25|$|In May 1836, Lovejoy {{decided to}} move with his family across the Mississippi River to Alton, Illinois, where he founded the Alton Observer and served as pastor at Upper Alton Presbyterian Church (now College Avenue Presbyterian Church). Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> the press, an angry mob broke into the Observer office and vandalized it. Only Alderman Bryan Mullanphy {{attempted}} to stop the crime, and no policemen or city officials intervened. Lovejoy packed {{what remained of the}} office for shipment to Alton. However, it sat on the riverbank, unguarded, overnight and was destroyed and thrown into the Mississippi River. Although Illinois was a free state, Alton, Illinois was a center for slave catchers trying to capture escaped slaves and for pro-slavery forces. Many escaped slaves crossed the Mississippi River from Missouri, a slave state. Alton had been settled by pro-slavery southerners who thought Alton should not become a haven for escaped slaves.|$|E

25|$|The Allied {{strategy}} {{had called}} for General Francisco Javier Venegas and the Spanish Army of La Mancha to prevent the French IV Corps under General of Division Horace François Bastien Sébastiani from reinforcing Joseph's army at Talavera. In this, Venegas was completely unsuccessful, but another opportunity opened up. With Sébastiani gone from his front, the way to Madrid was almost undefended. Though his own army was too crippled to move at the moment, Wellesley hoped that pressure from Venegas' offensive would compel the French to retreat. The Army of La Mancha pressed forward to Toledo and Aranjuez on 29 July, but then it unaccountably halted in place until 5 August. Dropping off Marshal Claude Perrin Victor's 18,000-man I Corps to watch Wellesley and Cuesta, Joseph pulled back to a position at Illescas where <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> to block either Venegas or Wellesley if necessary.|$|E
25|$|Early on March 31, 1865, Union Major General Philip Sheridan told Lieutenant General Ulysses S. Grant that he {{believed}} he could turn the Confederate right or make a breakthrough if the rain stopped {{and he had the}} help of an infantry corps. Sheridan wanted the VI Corps commanded by Major General Horatio G. Wright, which he had worked with in the Shenandoah Valley Campaigns of 1864, not the V Corps under Major General Gouverneur Warren whom Sheridan did not trust. Grant replied a few hours later that the VI Corps was {{in the center of the}} line and too far away to support Sheridan but <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> the II Corps by the next day. Grant also said that Wright thought he could go through the line from his current position. Although heavy rain continued that day, Confederate Major General George E. Pickett was about to change the situation and options of the Union commanders.|$|E
25|$|Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move,</b> however, Grant {{was faced}} {{with the problem of}} {{disengaging}} from Lee's army. Not only were the armies closely situated, Grant's first had to withdraw north over the North Anna, during which it would be very vulnerable to attack. Grant decided on a series of deceptive measures to disguise his intentions. On May 26, he sent a cavalry division under Brig. Gen. James H. Wilson to Little River, probing the western end of the Confederate line, {{while at the same time}} men from the cavalry divisions of Brig. Gens. Alfred T. A. Torbert and David McM. Gregg were sent to the Little Page Bridge and Taylor's Ford on the Pamunkey, 10 miles upriver from Grant's intended crossing points. Lee, who was still in his tent suffering from the diarrhea that had incapacitated him during the North Anna battle, was fooled by Grant's actions and assumed that the Union general would be moving west for the first time in the campaign.|$|E

25|$|After his {{situation}} had become hopeless at Camden, Steele gave up all thoughts of uniting with Banks on the Red River in a further campaign to take Shreveport {{and realized that}} he had to save his army. The battle of Jenkins' Ferry showed that Steele's force indeed was in danger while it was at Camden and southwest of the Saline River. Steele's decision to retreat to Little Rock therefore was a good one. Banks in turn had to give up any hope of renewing his campaign against Shreveport. His major problems in renewing the campaign actually did not include an insufficient number of men, however, because he was reinforced in late April by forces under Major-General John McClernand. Banks had logistical problems and would not have gunboat transport and support because of Porter’s inability to operate in the unusually low water of the Red River during that spring and summer. In fact, Banks had to protect Porter’s fleet at Alexandria, Louisiana until it could be freed from the Red River on May 13 before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> in any direction.|$|E
25|$|The {{summer of}} 1795 found the Prince of Castelfranco leading the Spanish army in Navarre, Gipuzkoa and Aragon. To protect his left, he placed Filanghieri with 9,000 regulars at Lekunberri and Crespo with 9,000 regulars {{guarding}} Bilbao in the north. On 28 June Moncey tried to envelop Crespo but the Spaniard fell back toward Vitoria-Gasteiz the next day. On 2 July Moncey concentrated against Filanghieri but that general slipped away before his corps could be crushed. On 12 July Dessein started south with 4,500 troops, capturing 25 guns abandoned by Crespo and reaching Vitoria on the 14th. As Willot moved from Salvatierra/Agurain with 3,500 men, Crespo escaped the trap {{and headed for}} Bilbao. The combined French columns pursued and occupied Bilbao on 19 July. The French took Miranda de Ebro on 22 July 1795 and Moncey prepared a blocking position there so <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> against Pamplona. However, the Peace of Basel was signed on the 22nd and the news reached the army on 5 August. The army began marching toward Bayonne on 17 August.|$|E
25|$|On 18 May 1945 Berlin's {{provisional}} city council, newly {{installed by}} the Soviet occupational power, had appointed Grüber as advisor for ecclesiastical affairs. This {{earned him a}} bilingual Russian-German certificate, issued on 21 May, to spare him from the usual robbery of bikes by Soviet soldiers, so that <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> {{at all in the}} city, with all the transportation system having collapsed, and an exemption from the curfew valid for Germans, issued on 9 July. On 15 July 1945 Dibelius appointed Grüber as Provost of St. Mary's and St. Nicholas' Church in Berlin and invested him on 8 August in a ceremony in St. Mary's Church, only partially cleared from the debris. Thus his time as pastor in Kaulsdorf ended. In 1946 the congregation commissioned the construction of a simple tent roof, covering the tower stump. Grüber's organisation for the relief of the survivors, today named Evangelical Relief Centre for the formerly Racially Persecuted, found later new premises in West Berlin's locality of Zehlendorf, so the Grübers moved there in 1949.|$|E

6000|$|... "Ma--ny tha--tha--tha--thanks!" [...] he said; {{and then}} his copper jaws clicked {{together}} and <b>he</b> <b>could</b> say no more. He next made an attempt to walk but after several awkward trials found <b>he</b> <b>could</b> not <b>move</b> his joints.|$|R
25|$|By 1800, Fletcher {{was worried}} that he might lose his job, {{as a result of}} the {{shortage}} of funds and the levels of compensation paid to landowners. He therefore asked Rennie if <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> on, and in 1801 obtained a post as Superintendent for the construction of Union Bridge in Aberdeen. The project was facing severe financial difficulty and another Act was submitted to Parliament. In the Act, dated 24 March 1801, the company noted that of the £20,000 authorized by the previous Act, only £17,800 had been subscribed. They obtained powers to raise another £20,000, in £20 shares, on which interest at five per cent would be paid. The preamble to the Act stated that much of the canal had been completed, but that the company had tried and failed to raise any more money. Interest on the new shares would be paid once receipts from the tolls allowed, and the full five per cent would be paid before any returns were made against the original shares. The company hoped to sell the new shares to the existing shareholders, but not all of them were keen to expand their holdings. A public sale of shares in September 1801 raised £11,421.|$|E
25|$|Hooker's {{plan for}} {{the spring and summer}} {{campaign}} was both elegant and promising. He first planned to send his cavalry corps deep into the enemy's rear, disrupting supply lines and distracting him from the main attack. He would pin down Robert E. Lee's much smaller army at Fredericksburg, while taking the large bulk of the Army of the Potomac on a flanking march to strike Lee in his rear. Defeating Lee, <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move</b> on to seize Richmond. Unfortunately for Hooker and the Union, the execution of his plan did not match the elegance of the plan itself. The cavalry raid was conducted cautiously by its commander, Brig. Gen. George Stoneman, and met none of its objectives. The flanking march went well enough, achieving strategic surprise, but when he attempted to advance with three columns, Stonewall Jackson's surprise attack on May 1 pushed Hooker back and caused him to withdraw his troops. From there, Hooker pulled his army back to Chancellorsville and waited for Lee to attack. Lee audaciously split his smaller army in two to deal with both parts of Hooker's army. Then, he split again, sending Stonewall Jackson's corps on its own flanking march, striking Hooker's exposed right flank and routing the Union XI Corps. The Army of the Potomac dropped into a purely defensive mode and eventually was forced to retreat.|$|E
500|$|Before <b>he</b> <b>could</b> <b>move,</b> however, he had {{to dispose}} of his {{thousands}} of [...] glass-plate negatives. [...] He also had to get himself out of debt once again. [...] In an attempt to accomplish both of these at once, he offered his collection of negatives to the Nebraska State Historical Society. [...] To Addison Sheldon, head of the Society's Legislative Reference Bureau, he wrote, [...] "Now {{is the time to}} buy me cheap, when I need the money so badly." [...] In November 1911, he and Sheldon signed a contract for the sale of the negatives for $1000. [...] Butcher was to receive $100 down; the rest would be paid after the Nebraska legislature passed a bill appropriating funds for the purchase.|$|E
