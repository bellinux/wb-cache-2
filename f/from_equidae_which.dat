40|$|Clostridium difficile is an antibiotic-associated {{emerging}} pathogen {{of humans}} and animals. Thus far three toxins of C. difficile have been described: an enterotoxin (ToxA), a cytotoxin (ToxB) and an ADP-ribosyltransferase (CDT). In the present work we describe the first isolation of CDT producing C. difficile <b>from</b> <b>Equidae</b> with gastro-intestinal disease. Out of 17 C. difficile strains isolated <b>from</b> <b>Equidae,</b> 11 were positive for the genes tcdA and tcdB encoding ToxA and ToxB. In addition four of these 11 isolates were positive for the cdtA gene encoding the catalytic subunit of the ADP-ribosyltransferase CDT. Interestingly none of the isolates derived from canines (41 isolates) and felines (4 isolates) harboured the cdtA gene. In C. difficile field isolates which contained the cdtA gene, ADP-ribosyltransferase activity could also be detected in culture supernatants indicating expression and secretion of CDT. All strains were associated with intestinal disorders, but no association was found for the occurrence of toxins with a specific clinical diagnosi...|$|R

5|$|Equus is a genus {{of mammals}} {{in the family}} <b>Equidae,</b> <b>which</b> {{includes}} horses, asses, and zebras. Within Equidae, Equus is the only recognized extant genus, comprising seven living species. The term equine refers to any member of this genus, including horses. Like Equidae more broadly, Equus has numerous extinct species known only from fossils. The genus most likely originated in North America and spread quickly to the Old World. Equines are odd-toed ungulates with slender legs, long heads, relatively long necks, manes (erect in most subspecies) and long tails. All species are herbivorous, and mostly grazers with simpler digestive systems than ruminants but able to subsist on lower quality vegetation.|$|R
50|$|The Stooges are con men who {{are selling}} phony racing forms to {{everyone}} especially they sold one to a man which {{he said that the}} racing form was expired and the Stooges stole his money and threatens to call the cops. After evading the policeman they help a destitute mother and her daughter by utilizing the money from the child's piggy bank, and ultimately winning a horse race. Riding high on their win, the boys come across two swindlers who trick them into buying retired race horse, Seabasket (a play on Seabiscuit). Broke again, the Stooges start taking care of the old horse, with Curly managing to accidentally swallow a Vitamin Z pill meant for the horse. However, the error allows Curly to give birth to an <b>Equidae,</b> <b>which</b> they crown as another winning race horse.|$|R
40|$|Although {{several studies}} have been devoted to the {{colloidal}} and soluble protein fractions of mare milk (caseins and whey proteins), to date {{little is known about}} the milk fat globule membrane (MFGM) protein fraction from mare milk. The objective of this study was thus to describe MFGM proteins <b>from</b> <b>Equidae</b> milk and to compare those proteins to already described MFGM proteins from cow and goat milk. Major MFGM proteins (namely, xanthine oxidase, butyrophilin, lactadherin, and adipophilin) already described in cow or goat milk were identified in mare milk using mass spectrometry. However, species-specific peculiarities were observed for 2 MFGM proteins: butyrophilin and lactadherin. A highly glycosylated 70 -kDa protein was characterized for equine butyrophilin, whereas proteins of 64 and 67 kDa were characterized for cow and goat butyrophilin, respectively. Prominent differences across species were highlighted for lactadherin. Indeed, whereas 1 or 2 polypeptide chains were identified, respectively, by peptide mass fingerprinting matrix-assisted laser desorption/ionization-time of flight analysis for caprine and bovine lactadherin, 4 isoforms (60, 57, 48, and 45 kDa) for lactadherin from mare milk were identified by 10 % sodium dodecyl sulfate-PAGE. Polymerase chain reaction experiments on lactadherin transcripts isolated from milk fat globules revealed the existence of 2 distinct lactadherin transcripts in the horse mammary gland. Cloning and sequencing of both transcripts encoding lactadherin showed an alternative use of a cryptic splice site located at the end of intron 5 of the equine lactadherin-encoding gene. This event results in the occurrence of an additional alanine (A) residue in the protein that disrupts a putative atypical N-glycosylation site (VNGC/VNAGC) described in human lactadherin. Liquid chromatography coupled with tandem mass spectrometry analyses confirmed the existence of both lactadherin variants in mare MFGM. We show here that lactadherin <b>from</b> <b>Equidae</b> milk is much more complex than that from Bovidae milk (i. e., cow and goat milk), therefore raising questions regarding the precise function of these different isoforms, if any, in the equine mammary gland...|$|R
40|$|Evaporation of {{moisture}} from the skin surface is an important means of thermoregulatory heat loss in <b>Equidae,</b> <b>which</b> respond to thermal stress with a smooth increase {{in the rate of}} sweat output to a plateau level which may be maintained for several hours (Allen & Bligh, 1969; Robertshaw & Taylor, 1969; Montgomery, Jenkinson & Elder, 1982). This pattern is similar to that which occurs when humans are exposed to a warm environment (Montgomery et al. 1984). The mode of sweat formation in both the horse and man is similar, involving cell death, fluid transport and the loss of vesicles both by exocytosis and microapocrine secretion (Montgomery etal. 1982, 1984). However, the secretions produced by the two glands differ markedly in electrolyte composition. Human sweat is a hypotonic fluid containing sodium chloride as its principal solute (Schulz, 1969; Sato, 1977), whereas equine sweat is hypertonic and contains a high concentration of potassium (Soliman & Nadim, 1967; Kerr & Snow, 1983). This could be a reflection of differences in the underlying mechanism of ionic transport within the gland...|$|R
40|$|Equine {{influenza}} is a severe, acute {{respiratory disease}} with characteristic clinical signs of pyrexia, dyspnoea, anorexia, and coughing, {{which is caused}} by 2 subtypes of influenza A virus (H 7 N 7 and H 3 N 8) of the family Orthomyxoviridae. H 7 N 7 viruses have not been isolated for a long time, although there is serological data that the virus may circulate sub-clinically (1), whereas epidemics caused by H 3 N 8 viruses occur frequently worldwide (2). The H 3 N 8 subtype has split into 2 distinct lineages, the American lineage represented by Newmarket/ 1 / 93, and the European lineage represented by Newmarket/ 2 / 93 (3). Equids are important for transport and farming in Turkey. Additionally, raising horses for racing is an economically important sector. No studies on the prevalence of equine influenza virus (EIV) infection in Turkey have been reported. The {{aim of this study}} was, therefore, to investigate the prevalence of antibodies to EIV in sera <b>from</b> <b>Equidae</b> in different regions of Turkey. For this purpose, 623 serum samples were randomly taken from horses, mules, and donkeys older than 4 years from 5 different geographical regions in Turkey (Figure) during 2003 - 2005.

40|$|To the Editor: In 2012, a novel {{coronavirus}} termed Middle East respiratory syndrome coronavirus (MERS-CoV) {{emerged on}} the Arabian Peninsula; {{the virus has}} been responsible for> 800 human cases. Recently, evidence of MERS-CoV infection in dromedaries {{was obtained from the}} Canary Islands, the Arabian Peninsula, and Africa (1 – 3). Viral sequences from dromedaries and from humans infected with MERS-CoV were highly similar, suggesting a prominent role of dromedaries as an animal reservoir of the virus (4). However, the serologic assessment of other animal species has been incomplete. Investigations of do-mestic animal species have been restricted to goats, sheep, and cattle (3) and a limited study of horses (n = 3) (5). No evidence of recent infection was found in either study. Whereas most known CoVs have a highly restricted host range in vitro and in vivo, MERS-CoV has been found to infect a broad range of cell cultures derived from Old and New World camelids as well as humans, primates, bats, pigs, and goats (6). MERS-CoV uses the receptor di-peptidyl-peptidase- 4 (DPP- 4) to enter its host cell (7). Se-quence comparison between the receptor-binding domain of the MERS-CoV spike protein and several mammalian DPP- 4 sequences showed a higher percentage identity in the amino acid residues critical for virus entry between hu-man and horse DPP- 4 than between human and dromedary DPP- 4 (8). It has been shown that MERS-CoV can use horse DPP- 4 expressed on nonsusceptible cells (9), but no data are available on susceptibility of primary horse cells. Therefore, members of the family <b>Equidae,</b> <b>which</b> include domestic horses, donkeys, and mules, might be susceptible to MERS-CoV infection. According to the Food and Agri...|$|R
40|$|International audienceIn this study, {{we propose}} a method based on life tables {{currently}} used in population dynamics and ecology {{to compare the}} mortality curves of <b>Equidae</b> <b>from</b> anthropic and carnivore fossil assemblages with those from modern populations. The combined analysis of frequency (fx) with various ecological parameters such as mortality rate (qx), survival rate (lx), fecundity rate (mx), and killing factor (kx), established for each age class, allows us to characterize the stability of fossil populations. These ecological parameters, developed in demography, correspond to many curves and constitute a complementary approach to interpret the two main mortality models, attritional and catastrophic, often evoked in zooarchaeology. The age structures of fossil horses from the anthropic sites of Bau de l'Aubesier (Vaucluse, France) and Combe-Grenal (Dordogne, France) and the hyena den of Fouvent (Haute-Saoˆ ne, France) are compared to typical catastrophic modern populations of <b>Equidae</b> <b>from</b> the National Park of Akagera (Rwanda). We also used data collected by the Bureau of Land Management for present day feral horses from Pryor Mountain (Montana, USA) which constitutes a reliable referential of a stable living population.

Their non-structural (NS) genes were amplified and sequenced. Results: The results show high homology of NS nucleotide sequences of A/equine/Nador/ 1 / 1997 with European strains (i. e., A/equine/newmarket/ 2 / 93 and A/equine/Grobois/ 1 / 1998) and clustered into the European lineage. However, NS gene of A/equine/Essaouira/ 2 / 2004 (H 3 N 8) and A/equine/Essaouira/ 3 / 2004 (H 3 N 8) strains indicated high homology with equine influenza strains that had circulated before 1990 (A/equine/Fontainbleu/ 1 / 1979 (H 3 N 8), which {{belonged to a}} pre-divergent phase Amino acid sequence comparison of the NS 1 protein with reference strain A/ equine/Miami/ 1963 (H 3 N 8) shows that the A/equine/Nador/ 1 / 1997 (H 3 N 8) strain has 12 substitutions at the residues D/ 24 /N, R/ 44 /K, S/ 48 /I, R/ 67 /Q, A/ 86 /V, E/ 139 /K, A/ 112 /T, E/ 186 /K, L/ 185 /F, A/ 223 /E, S/ 213 /T and S/ 228 /P.
