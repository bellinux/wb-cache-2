40|$|Clutch is device {{which is}} used to {{transmit}} power one component to another. It is a device used to connect the driving shaft to a driven shaft, so that the driven shaft may be started or stopped at will, without stopping the driving shaft. A clutch thus provides an interruptible connection between two rotating shafts Clutches allow a high inertia load to be stated with a small power. The engine power transmitted to the system through the clutch. The failure of such a critical component during service can stall the whole application. The objective of present project is to do analysis on <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> of a clutch which is often fails during the operation. In this present research work analysis is conducted on <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> of a clutch used in TATA Vehicle. There are so many complaints are noted against the failure of clutch during heavy loads. The <b>driven</b> main <b>plate</b> failed normally during its operation due to cyclic loading.

40|$|Abstract. The Dry-type Dual Clutch {{system is}} {{designed}} for a certain Dual Clutch Transmission (DCT), and transient analysis is performed to investigate the thermal influence on <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> in sophisticated slip conditions, which is determined by control strategy of DCT. First, a clutch engagement model is developed to obtain transient friction power corresponding to selected control strategy, {{and the distribution of}} time-varying heat flux is derived. On that basis, the thermal effects on the <b>driven</b> <b>plate</b> are simulated by finite element method. Finally, the temperature and thermal stress distributions on the frictional surfaces are acquired, which shows that the previously designed clutch system agrees with thermo requirements. This new approach which is more superior to the traditional clutch analysis, can adjust to different control strategies, thus it can be applied to facilitate the thermo analysis and practical design of DCT system...|$|R
50|$|Fluid motions {{occur in}} the magnetosphere, atmosphere, ocean, mantle and core. Even the mantle, though it has an {{enormous}} viscosity, flows like a fluid over long time intervals (see geodynamics). This flow is reflected in phenomena such as isostasy, post-glacial rebound and mantle plumes. The mantle flow <b>drives</b> <b>plate</b> tectonics and the flow in the Earth's core drives the geodynamo.|$|R

50|$|Although {{the raised}} {{surfaces}} of mountain ranges mainly result from crustal thickening, {{there are other}} forces at play {{that are responsible for}} tectonic activity. All tectonic processes are driven by gravitational force when density differences are present. A good example of this would be the large-scale circulation of the Earth's mantle. Lateral density variations near the surface (such as the creation, cooling, and subduction of oceanic <b>plates)</b> also <b>drive</b> <b>plate</b> motion.|$|R
