Escherichia coli complex I (NADH dehydrogenase) is capable of proton translocation {{in the same direction}} to the established Δψ, showing that in the tested conditions, the coupling ion is H+. Na+ transport in the opposite direction was observed, and although Na+ was not necessary for the catalytic or proton transport activities, its presence increased the latter. H+ was translocated by the Paracoccus denitrificans complex I, but in this case, H+ transport was not influenced by Na+, and Na+ transport was not observed. Possibly, the E. coli complex I has two energy coupling sites (one Na+ independent and the other Na+dependent), as observed for the Rhodothermus marinus complex I, whereas the coupling mechanism of the P. denitrificans enzyme is completely Na+ independent. It is also possible that another transporter catalyzes the uptake of Na+. [...] Complex I <b>energy</b> <b>transduction</b> by proton pumping may not be exclusive to the R. marinus enzyme. The Na+/H+ antiport activity seems not to be a general property of complex I. However, the existence of Na+-translocating activity of the complex I is still in question.|$|E
2500|$|In 1906, Planck {{acknowledged}} that his imaginary resonators, having linear dynamics, {{did not provide}} a physical explanation for <b>energy</b> <b>transduction</b> between frequencies. Present-day physics explains the transduction between frequencies {{in the presence of}} atoms by their quantum excitability, following Einstein. Planck believed that in a cavity with perfectly reflecting walls and with no matter present, the electromagnetic field cannot exchange energy between frequency components. This is because of the linearity of Maxwell's equations. Present-day quantum field theory predicts that, in the absence of matter, the electromagnetic field obeys nonlinear equations and in that sense does self-interact. Such interaction in the absence of matter has not yet been directly measured because it would require very high intensities and very sensitive and low-noise detectors, which are {{still in the process of}} being constructed. [...] Planck believed that a field with no interactions neither obeys nor violates the classical principle of equipartition of energy, and instead remains exactly as it was when introduced, rather than evolving into a black body field. Thus, the linearity of his mechanical assumptions precluded Planck from having a mechanical explanation of the maximization of the entropy of the thermodynamic equilibrium thermal radiation field. This is why he had to resort to Boltzmann's probabilistic arguments.|$|E
