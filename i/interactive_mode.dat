Due to nonlinear modal coupling associated with aerodynamic forces, all the modes of a band are in internal resonance. By referring to a nearly-periodic system consisting of weakly coupled beams and using the multiple scale perturbation method, a system of nonlinear differential equations in the amplitudes and phases of the <b>interactive</b> <b>modes</b> is obtained. Numerical results relative to a two-beam system are presented. In particular, the conditions under which steady-state solutions can occur are determined and their stability is investigated, while the occurrence of periodic motions involving exchanges of energy among the <b>interactive</b> <b>modes</b> is also remarked upon.

40|$|The {{health of}} {{political}} parties and representative democratic institutions have been extensively questioneddue to evidence of a widespread decline in voting turnouts, political trust, party membership and ‐ identification. Anoften proposed strategy to strengthen representative democracy is for political institutions to offer new forms ofpolitical participation, so called participatory engineering. This paper explores the possibility of participatoryengineering projects in local politics to influence more <b>interactive</b> <b>modes</b> of representation among local electedrepresentatives, by analyzing a survey of local political representatives in six Swedish municipalities. The study isbased on a comparative case selection made to include municipalities where the least and the most participatoryengineering projects have been carried out. The study reveals a complex relationship between participatoryengineering and political representation. Despite a tendency of more positive attitudes towards citizens’participation and more identification with <b>interactive</b> <b>modes</b> of representation, {{the attitudes of the}} representativeswith most experience of participatory engineering still, to a great extent, agree with a party centered role ofrepresentation where pursuing the party‐line is prioritized over citizen influence. The results can be understood asan illustration of the prevailing tradition of strong political parties in Sweden, and contribute to the understandingof the outcomes of projects of participatory engineering. This study suggests that the assumed relationship betweencivic engagement and democratic gods such as political interest, ‐knowledge, ‐efficacy, and participation must beinvestigated with reference to a possible hesitance among elected representatives to adapt citizen participation totheir style of representation...|$|R

The advantages of the method are strong guarantees of semantic consistency of the convergent representation, capabilities to use it in autonomous and user <b>interactive</b> <b>modes</b> as well as avoidance of combinatorial explosion peculiar to many other methods.
