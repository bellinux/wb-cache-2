40|$|Negotiations {{to reach}} an {{agreement}} on <b>import</b> <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> to reopen the Korean market to U. S. beef took place {{over the past few years}} amid enormous political and public resistance in Korea. The expected benefi ts, however, will make the negotiations well worth the effort for both sides. In 2003, Korean imports of U. S. beef reached $ 749. 3 million before imports were banned when a case of bovine spongiform encephalopathy (BSE) was diagnosed in the United States. U. S. beef began fl owing back into Korea in July 2008, and the value of these exports reached $ 270 million by the end of November. Despite this success, rebuilding exports to reach the full potential of this market will take time. The following is a brief overview of several market conditions that are dampening sales in the early months of renewed trade and longer-term expectations for conditions that would greatly increase demand and market access...|$|E
50|$|The Northwest Cattle Project is an {{agreement}} between the United States and Canada, first announced on October 22, 1997, that was initially intended to facilitate shipments of live cattle from the states of Montana and Washington to Canada. Such shipments had been blocked due to Canadian animal health rules. Canada revised its animal <b>health</b> <b>import</b> <b>requirements</b> for live cattle entering from these U.S. states among other things by recognizing areas deemed to be at low risk for certain animal diseases. The project has since been expanded to many more U.S. states, particularly after the two countries signed a joint cooperation agreement {{on a variety of}} agricultural matters in late 1998.|$|R
40|$|The New Zealand {{government}} (through its agency the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry, MAF) {{seeks to}} mitigate the potential negative impacts of importation through requiring commodities that may pose a risk to New Zealand’s primary production systems, human health, indigenous flora, fauna or biodiversity to have an <b>import</b> <b>health</b> standard. Given, potential import opportunities exist {{in a wide variety}} of commodities from many different countries, the demand for <b>import</b> <b>health</b> standards far outweighs MAF’s available resources to develop them. Therefore MAF must have a framework that prioritises which <b>import</b> <b>health</b> standards will be developed.

40|$|MAF was {{approached}} in 2002 with {{a request to}} import juvenile yellowtail kingfish from south Australia. There was no <b>import</b> <b>health</b> standard to cover such an importation and before one could be developed a risk analysis was required. The importer elected to commission a private risk analysis due to existing demands on MAF’s risk analysis resources. In December 2002 the risk analysis was subjected to peer review by MAF staff as well as technical experts outside MAF. After addressing the comments from reviewers the risk analysis was made available for public consultation in February 2003. Submissions from the public were forwarded to the analyst in April 2003. The analyst’s review of submission was received by MAF in August 2004. The risk analysis and review of submissions will now be used to develop an <b>import</b> <b>health</b> standard.

40|$|To {{determine}} whether certain subgroups of fire fighters {{are prone to}} work-related diminished <b>health</b> <b>requirements.</b> The <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> for fire-fighting were tested in a workers' health surveillance (WHS) setting. These <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> included psychological, physical and sense-related components as well as cardiovascular risk factors. The odds ratio (OR) and 95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) {{for the presence of}} the diminished <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> were calculated for the subgroups of gender, professionalism and age. The prevalence of diminished psychological requirements was equivalent among the subgroups, and no significant high-risk group was identified. As compared to men fire fighters, women fire fighters {{were more likely to have}} diminished physical requirements (OR 28. 5; 95 % CI 12. 1 - 66. 9) and less likely to have cardiovascular risk factors (OR 0. 3; 0. 1 - 0. 5). As compared to volunteer fire fighters, professionals were less likely to have diminished physical requirements (OR 0. 5; 0. 3 - 0. 9), but professionals had a higher prevalence of cardiovascular risk factors with an odds ratio of 1. 9 (1. 1 - 3. 2). As compared to the youngest fire fighters, the oldest fire fighters were more likely to have diminished sense-related requirements (OR 7. 1; 3. 4 - 15. 2); a similar comparison could be made between oldest and middle-aged fire fighters (OR 5. 1; 2. 5 - 10. 5). In addition, the oldest fire fighters were more likely to have cardiovascular risk factors when compared to the youngest (OR 4. 4; 1. 7 - 11. 1) and to the middle-aged fire fighters (OR 3. 1; 1. 2 - 7. 9). Subgroups (gender, professionalism and age) of fire fighters are prone to at least one specific work-related diminished <b>health</b> <b>requirement.</b> Therefore, parts of the WHS could be applied with more attention to these high-risk group...|$|R

40|$|Following {{a request}} from the EU Commission, the EFSA PLH Panel {{conducted}} a scientific opinion on risk analysis and supporting documents provided by APHIS/USDA {{in support of the}} request to remove the Union's plant <b>health</b> <b>import</b> <b>requirement</b> that citrus fruit imported into the EU be sourced from groves where, {{since the beginning of the}} last cycle of vegetation no symptoms of citrus canker were observed, neither in their vicinities. The PHL Panel concluded that the transmission of Xanthomonas citri subsp. citri (Xcc) on asymptomatic citrus fruit was more likely when the fruit were collected from infested than from non-infested areas and groves. Symptomatic fruit carries more Xcc cells than asymptomatic fruit and the packinghouse disinfectant treatments do not achieve the eradication of Xcc. The application of management option 2 (i. e. „allow distribution of all types and varieties of commercially packed citrus fruit to all US States, subject to packinghouse treatment with APHIS-approved disinfectant. No packinghouse phytosanitary inspection is required‟) selected by USDA will result in an increase in the Xcc load of citrus fruit consignments and in a subsequent increase in the probability of spread of citrus canker through the fruit pathway. Some data provided in the APHIS-USDA documents support that citrus fruit remain a conceptually possible pathway for transmitting and establishing citrus canker disease. The PLH Panel agrees that transmission of Xcc from infected fruit to a susceptible host is rare. But the withdrawal of the current EU requirement that citrus fruit imported into the EU be sourced from groves where no symptoms of citrus canker have been observed in the field of production and in its immediate vicinity since the beginning of the last cycle of vegetation, will increase the probability of introduction of Xcc into new areas...|$|R

40|$|Background Mandatory medical {{examinations}} (MMEs) of workers {{should be based}} on the <b>health</b> and safety <b>requirements</b> that are needed for effectively performing the relevant work. For police personnel in the Netherlands, no job-specific MME exists that takes the specific tasks and duties into account. Aims To provide the Dutch National Police with a knowledge base for job-specific MMEs for police personnel that will lead to equitable decisions from an occupational health perspective about who can perform police duties. Methods We used a stepwise mixed-methods approach in which we included interviews with employees and experts and a review of the national and international literature. We determined the job demands for the various police jobs, determined which were regarded as specific job demands and formulated the matching <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> as specific as possible for each occupation. Results A total of 21 specific job demands were considered relevant in different police jobs. These included biomechanical, physiological, physical, emotional, psychological/cognitive and sensory job demands. We formulated both police-generic and job-specific <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> based on the specific job demands. Two examples are presented: bike patrol and criminal investigation. Conclusions Our study substantiated the need for job-specific MMEs for police personnel. We found specific job demands that differed substantially for various police jobs. The corresponding <b>health</b> <b>requirements</b> were partly police-generic, and partly job-specifi...|$|R
