40|$|In many {{models for}} {{biological}} processes {{it is assumed}} that the reactor contents are well mixed. This assumption may be good if the reactor is small but for a large reactor this assumption is not so good. Here we analyse a model for a bioreactor with imperfect mixing. We use a two parameter mixing model in which the reactor is split into two compartments: a large compartment and a small compartment, with mixing between the two compartments. In each compartment there are two equations: one for the concentration of substrate and one for the concentration of microorganism. The interaction between the substrate and biomass is governed by Monod growth kinetics. We investigate how the <b>effluent</b> <b>concentration</b> leaving the reactor depends upon the degree of mixing in the reactor (δ) {{and the size of the}} small compartment (ε).

Little measured data of sufficient quality and spatial extent have been available to verify this risk assessment. New measured data have been collected from sewage treatment plant effluents and the receiving waters upstream and downstream of these discharges from the Erewash and the Avon river systems in England, UK. The model results for these rivers were in good agreement with the measured values in terms of estradiol equivalents. Critically, the risk assessment based on the measured data gave a near identical risk assessment to that from the modeled results. For individual estrogens, 17 α-ethinylestradiol was modeled best and estrone worst.
