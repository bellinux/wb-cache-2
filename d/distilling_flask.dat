50|$|In {{a typical}} {{fractional}} distillation, a liquid mixture is heated in the <b>distilling</b> <b>flask,</b> {{and the resulting}} vapor rises up the fractionating column (see Figure 1). The vapor condenses on glass spurs (known as trays or plates) inside the column, {{and returns to the}} <b>distilling</b> <b>flask,</b> refluxing the rising distillate vapor. The hottest tray is {{at the bottom of the}} column and the coolest tray is at the top. At steady-state conditions, the vapor and liquid on each tray reach an equilibrium. Only the most volatile of the vapors stays in gas form all the way to the top, where it may then proceed through a condenser, which cools the vapor until it condenses into a liquid distillate. The separation may be enhanced by the addition of more trays (to a practical limitation of heat, flow, etc.).|$|E
40|$|Synopsis Several {{methods for}} the {{determination}} of particle size distribution of aerosols have been reviewed. The Cascade Impactor was investigated and found suitable for classi-fying the particle size distribution of aerosols between 0. 5 and 32. 0 u. Various sampling chambers were evaluated and {{the design of the}} chamber was found to be an ixnportant factor for particle size distribution. A modified <b>distilling</b> <b>flask</b> proved to be most suitable for this purpose. The particle size distribution of two aerosol hair spray formulations was deter-nilned using this technique. Particles between 0. 5 and 32 u were classified with special attention given to those particles below 10 u in diameter. Several valve combinations were studied and evaluated {{on the basis of the}} proportion of particles below 10 u. The Cascade Impactor has been shown to be satisfactory for evaluating the toxicological potential of these aerosols based upon particle size distribution and upon other considerations...|$|E
40|$|Difficulties with {{reproducibility}} {{of isolation}} yields when distilling 211 At from irradiated bismuth targets {{led us to}} use a “wet chemistry” approach for that process 1. The wet chemistry approach has provided 211 At isolation yields of ~ 78 % after decay and Bi attenuation corrections 2. However, the use of diisopropyl ether (DIPE) in the separation process has {{made it difficult to}} reach our goal of automating the 211 At isolation. Therefore, we have investigated the use of column materials to simplify the isolation of 211 At and remove DIPE from the process. In this investigation we evaluated the use of a strong anion exchange resin (AG 1 × 8), a strong cation exchange resin (AG MP- 50) and a polyethylene glycol (PEG) -coated resin for separation of 211 At from the bismuth target material. Anion and cation resins AG 1 × 8 and AG MP- 50 were obtained from commercial sources. A PEG-coated resin was prepared by reaction of the Merrifield resin with mPEG-OH 2000 in the pres-ence of tBuOK at 80 °C for 3 days, followed by drying under vacuum. Prior to use of the PEG resin, it was soaked in H 2 O. Resins (400 – 800 mg) were loaded into polypropylene columns (Applied Separations, Inc.). Column elution studies were conducted with and without reductants (0. 75 M FeSO 4 / 1 M H 2 SO 4 or Na 2 S 2 O 5) to determine their effect on capture of 211 At. After target dissolution in HNO 3 (and in most cases subse-quent removal of HNO 3 by distillation and redis-solution of solid in 8 M HCl), 211 At solution was loaded onto the column, then the column was washed with 2 M HCl or H 2 O to separate the Bi, and finally was eluted with strong base to remove the 211 At. Initial studies were conducted with stable iodine to determine if reductants were effective in the presence of large amounts of bismuth ions. Studies with AG 1 × 8 used 125 I to determine if that radiohalogen could be captured and recovered from the column when eluting with boric acid buffers at pH 5. 3, 8. 0 or 10, or H 2 O at pH 7. Capture and recovery of 211 At was evaluated under the same conditions. Further studies with AG 1 × 8 involved eluting with 4 M H 2 SO 4. A limited study with AG MP- 50 resin used 1 M HCl as eluant. Studies with PEG-coated columns used 2 M HCl, 4 M HCl, 8 M HCl, 16 M HNO 3 and 8 M HNO 3 as initial (capture) eluants. Strong base (0. 2, 1 or 12. 5 M NaOH; 15 M NH 4 OH) and 3 or 500 mM tetrabutylammonium bromide (TBAB) were evaluated for removal of 211 At from the columns tested. The efficiency for capture of 211 At on the AG 1 × 8 column was high (99 %) when loading with strong acid, but decreased when using 0. 1 – 0. 2 M boric acid (69 – 91 %) buffer. Low 211 At capture efficiencies were obtained with AG MP- 50 col-umns (15 – 29 %). High 211 At capture efficiencies (96 – 100 %) were obtained with PEG-coated resins when loading with 8 M HCl or 8 M HNO 3, irre-spective of whether reductant was in the acid solution. Four column washings (2 mL of 2 M HCl each) were required to remove all Bi prior to elution of 211 At. No bismuth was detected in solution from the 4 th washing in any of the elutions studied. Low (< 6 %) recovery of 211 At from the AG 1 × 8 columns was obtained using the conditions studied. Good (60 – 79 %) recovery of 211 At was obtained from PEG-coated resin using 15 M NH 4 OH. Isolation of the 211 At from NH 4 OH solution was accomplished by distillation. In an initial study 211 At distilled before obtaining a dry residue. However, later studies demonstrated that addi-tion of NaOH prior to distillation kept the 211 At in the <b>distilling</b> <b>flask.</b> These studies demonstrated that PEG-coated columns could be used to isolate 211 At from HNO 3 -dissolved bismuth targets with good non-optimized (~ 60 %) overall recovery yields. The studies are continuing with optimization of elu-tion conditions and automation of the process...|$|E

40|$|Oxidation-reduction {{potentials}} {{developed in}} cultures of Esch. coli {{have been reported}} by Cannan, Cohen, and Clark (1928), Hewitt (1931) and Boyd and Reed (1931). Boyd and Reed presented evidence that both gaseous (hydrogen) and non-gaseous electromotively active systems {{are responsible for the}} potentials observed at different periods of growth in anaerobic cultures of Esch. coli. The studies to be reported here were confined to the potentials developed in stationary and continuous flow cultures of Esch. coli in peptone, a somewhat less complex medium than those employed by other investigators. It has been reported (Clifton, 1933 a) that broth cultures of Staphylococcus aureus in or near the maximum stationary growth phase reduce potassium ferricyanide at a rate in the neighborhood of 6. 6 X 10 - 14 millimols per cell per minute. These studies have been extended to the rates of reduction of ferricyanide at different stages of growth in stationary and continuous flow cul-tures of Esch. coli. Studies on the influence of the concentra-tion of peptone, ferricyanide and organisms on the rate of reduc-tion of ferricyanide in suspensions of "resting " Esch. coli, as outlined in a preliminary paper by one of us (Clifton, 1933 b), are also presented.

40|$|Trader, Brian W. Oaks (Quercus L.) are {{globally}} iconic trees, prized {{for their}} contributions as a keystone species, strong, rot-resistant wood, and landscape value. Despite their importance, many species of Quercus are under threat {{from a range of}} issues, such as habitat loss and attacks from pests and diseases. Conservation efforts for this genus can be complex and challenging, especially since Quercus species are considered “recalcitrant” due to the inability of their seeds, acorns, to survive seed banking, an important conservation method. One method to support conservation efforts is in vitro culture (tissue culture) using newly-flushed shoot tips. Two experiments were conducted to determine 1) the viability of bud-forcing Quercus and effectiveness of 6 -benzylaminopurine (BAP), a cytokinin, on stimulating bud break and shoot elongation of Quercus and 2) the responses of species from the three North American Quercus sections (Lobatae, Quercus, and Protobalanus) on two different media in in vitro culture. Natural shoot emergence in the spring is a narrow and somewhat unpredictable time window, but forcing bud break of cuttings can lengthen this window in a controlled environment. Experiment 1 involved dormant cuttings collected from 12 Quercus species placed into <b>flasks</b> of <b>distilled</b> water. <b>Flasks</b> were placed in a greenhouse with weekly BAP treatments applied by paint brush at either 0, 100, or 500 ppm. Results varied by species. The BAP treatment at 100 or 500 ppm significantly increased the rate of bud break and shoot elongation for four of the Quercus species (imbricaria, macrocarpa, pagoda, and variabilis) and significantly decreased the rate of bud break and shoot elongation in Q. falcata. There was no significant effect from BAP application on the remaining seven species. A majority of the Quercus species reached the target stage for micropropagation with all treatments, indicating that forcing bud break is a viable option for Quercus, but the rate of bud development in some species may be enhanced by BAP application. In Experiment 2, newly-flushed shoots were collected in the spring from 12 species of Quercus representing the three North American Quercus sections (Lobatae, Quercus, and Protobalanus) (different species from Experiment 1). The shoot explants were grown in vitro on one of two media formulations: Gresshoff and Doy (GD) basal salts and vitamins or Lloyd and McCown Woody Plant (WP) basal salts with Murashige and Skoog (MS) vitamins. Responses of growth, survival, and contamination varied by species, but these differences were concealed when grouped by section. Growth responses of leaf expansion, bud expansion, shoot production, and callus production were observed in nine of the species. Explants grown on WP/MS media had significantly more growth responses and longer survival times than those on GD media. University of Delaware, Department of Plant and Soil SciencesM. S...|$|R
