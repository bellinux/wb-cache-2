40|$|The {{objectives}} {{of this study}} are to contribute {{to the understanding of the}} export process in smaller firms and to provide a benchmark against which export strategy and pricing policies can be assessed, particularly in the context of the impact of floating currencies on exporters. The study consists, firstly, of a literature survey in the fields of pricing and export management, drawing on some 600 sources. Primary data were collected through a small number of depth interviews with export executives and a postal questionnaire survey of 250 medium-sized exporting manufacturers in the North of England, drawn from the Clothing. Furniture, Chemicals and Scientific Instrumentation industries. The theory of export strategy is reviewed, particularly in the context of key market concentration, as the foundation for export policies, including export pricing on which attention is focussed here. Challenges are offered to the arguments and empirical evidence on which the key market philosophy is founded and an alternative strategy proposed: market spreading. Empirical evidence is produced to show the existence of both concentration and spreading strategies in practical exporting, and to assess the underlying logic of market spreading as an alternative to market concentration, together with the situational cues associated with each. From general pricing theory and methods, attention is directed to the more specialised problems of export pricing. Consideration is given to the relationship between domestic market and export prices and pricing methods, and the existence and form of discriminatory pricing in exporting. The emphasis placed on price in the export marketing programme is analysed in the context of the debate on price versus non-price aspects of competition in international markets. Lastly, arising out of export pricing policy is the key issue of pricing currency, particularly as the mediator of the impact of floatation on the exporter. Attention is given to the <b>export</b> <b>invoice</b> currency decision, and the underlying reasons for currency choices as a challenge to the normative theory offered to exporters by the literature, together with the consequent implications of currency movements at the company level...|$|E
40|$|We {{investigate}} {{the determinants of}} currency choice for trade invoicing in a cross-country context while focusing on the link between capital account liberalization {{and its impact on}} the use of the renminbi (RMB). We find that while countries with more developed financial markets tend to invoice less in the US dollar, countries with more open capital accounts tend to invoice in either the euro or their home currency. These results indicate that financial development and financial openness are among the keys to challenging the US dollar dominance in general, and to internationalizing the RMB for the People’s Republic of China (PRC). Our model also suggests that the share of the RMB in <b>export</b> <b>invoicing</b> should have been higher than the actually observed share of less than 10 %. The underperformance of RMB <b>export</b> <b>invoicing</b> can be attributed to the inertia in the choice of currency for trade invoicing; once a currency is used for trade invoicing or settlements, it becomes difficult for traders to switch from one currency to another. This same phenomenon was also observed in the cases of the Japanese yen and the euro at their inceptions as international currencies. Our model predicts that the share of RMB invoicing for the PRC’s exports will rise to above 25 % in 2015 and above 30 % in 2018, whether or not the PRC implements drastic financial liberalization. As the near future path of RMB use is also expected to be inertial, these forecasts are probably at the upper end of the actual path of RMB <b>export</b> <b>invoicing...</b>|$|R

40|$|Cross-country {{differences}} {{in the choice of}} an invoicing currency in international trade is one reason for cross-country {{differences in}} estimated exchange rate coefficients in short-run balance of trade equations. If <b>exports</b> are <b>invoiced</b> in domestic currency while imports are invoiced in a foreign currency, a depreciation will increase the domestic currency value of outstanding import contracts, and may cause the balance of trade to fall in the short run. Countries with different invoicing patterns will have different effects on the short-run trade balance following a depreciation. We explore a simple theory of invoicing currency choice, drawing inferences regarding the likely choices for 14 countries. This allows a classification of countries according to the expected short-run balance of trade effect of a currency depreciation.

40|$|In this paper, we {{investigate}} {{how much a}} major currency is used for trade invoicing by focusing primarily on {{the experiences of the}} U. S. dollar, the Japanese yen, and the Deutsche mark (DM) in the 1970 s through the 1990 s. We then attempt to draw lessons for China’s renminbi (RMB) internationalization. Our data on the shares of the three major currencies in <b>export</b> <b>invoicing</b> show that the dollar was unequivocally a global invoicing currency, and that the DM was the most important regional currency in Europe while the yen was never a global or a regional currency. DM invoicing was driven by European countries’ trade ties with Germany. In contrast, the yen was not widely used for trade invoicing by Asia-Oceania countries despite the latter’s strong trade ties with Japan. Our regression analysis on the determinants of the major currency share in trade invoicing (also including UK pound sterling, the French franc, the Italian lira, and the Swiss franc) in the 1970 - 1998 period shows that the invoicing share of a major currency tended to be positively affected by the degree of other economies’ trade ties with the major currency country and negatively affected by the degree of their financial development or openness. Also, the major currency share in trade invoicing was affected by both other economies 2 ̆ 7 assigned weights of the major currency in their implicit currency baskets and these economies’ trade shares with major-currency zone countries. Economies belonging to the U. S. dollar (or DM) zone tended to invoice their trade more in the dollar (or DM) and less in the DM (or dollar). The use of yen for trade invoicing was not much affected by these factors. European countries largely belonged to the DM zone and tended to use the DM for trade invoicing, whereas Asia-Oceania countries belonged mainly to the U. S. dollar zone, leading to a high degree of dollar use. We also find that major currency countries tended to invoice their trade in their own currencies when they had a large presence in international trade, high levels of per capita income, and financial markets that were developed and open. For China, its low level of per capita income, limited financial openness, and the presence of U. S. dollar zone countries in Asia stand as a challenge to the nation’s ambition to promote the RMB as a major trade-invoicing currency...|$|R
40|$|What are the {{macroeconomic}} {{consequences of}} the dominant role of the dollar in the international monetary system? Here, we present a calibrated two country model in which <b>exports</b> are <b>invoiced</b> in the key currency, and government bonds denominated in the key currency are held internationally to facilitate trade. Domestic government bonds and money are held in each country to facilitate domestic transactions. Our model generates deviations from uncovered interest parity that are as volatile as some empirical estimates, but much too small by others. Our model also speaks to some other empirical anomalies, such as the Backus - Smith puzzle. Shocks affecting asset supplies [...] such as bond financed tax cuts, and open market operations [...] have large effects in our model because they generate non-Ricardian changes in household wealth. Generally, shocks emanating from the key currency country do more to destabilize the world economy than equal sized shocks coming from the other country. Similarly, monetary and fiscal policy innovations in the key currency country are more potent {{than those in the}} other country. On the other hand, the key currency country is more vulnerable to financial market turbulence, such as a sell off of key currency bonds, which can lower consumption dramatically. ...|$|R
40|$|It {{has been}} a {{well-known}} puzzle why the yen has not been used more in trade invoicing among Japanese exporters. Despite the yen’s status as an only fully convertible currency in Asia, two patterns stand out as puzzling features of an excessively small share of yen invoicing: First, a strong tendency of Japanese exporters to choose importer's currency in their exports to advanced countries, and second, the prevalence of US dollar <b>invoicing</b> in Japanese <b>exports</b> to East Asia even though Japanese firms have built a regional production network {{in the last two}} decades. New possible determinants of currency invoicing at a firm-level are found through interviews with Japanese representative <b>exporting</b> firms. <b>Invoicing</b> behavior is examined by probit estimation using the unique data set on the firms' currency invoicing choice by destination. Our novel findings suggest that a surprisingly low share of yen <b>invoicing</b> among Japanese <b>exports</b> even in the 2000 s can be attributable to (1) a scale-economy in concentrating currency risk at the headquarter as intra-firm trades with overseas operations of Japanese firms grew; and (2) the production/trade structure of Japanese electronics companies in Asia in which final products tend to be exported to the United States or Europe. ...|$|R

In contrast to existing literature, we focus on an economy with vertical trade, where the currencies in the basket may play different roles in invoicing trade flow.

40|$|This paper {{examines}} how China's exports {{are affected by}} exchange rate shocks from countries who supply intermediate inputs to China. We build a simple small open economy model with intermediate goods trade to show that due to the intraregional trade in intermediate goods, a devaluation of other Asian currencies does not necessarily damage China's exports, as imported intermediate goods could become cheaper. This channel through the cost of intermediate goods depends critically on the share of intermediate goods used in China's export goods production {{and the degree of}} exchange rate pass-through in imported intermediate goods prices. If prices for intermediate goods are not very sticky, the effect through this channel could be large and China's exports could even benefit. We find the above findings do not depend on China's choice of currency invoicing between RMB and the US dollar or the choice between fixed and flexible exchange rate regimes.

40|$|The {{focus of}} the paper is on {{identifying}} major factors that can determine the vulnerability of Polish manufacturing companies to exchange rate risk. In order to verify our hypotheses, we have estimated logistic regression models based on a unique database to assess internal and external factors that make companies vulnerable to exchange rate risk. Our observations confirm the importance of exchange rate variability {{as one of the}} obstacles to starting and conducting export activity as well as expanding it to new markets. We have found that exchange rate risk is particularly severe for companies that are financially constrained and get financing abroad as well as those whose balance sheets are negatively affected by devaluation. Also vulnerable are innovative firms and those that rely more on input imports. Exchange rate volatility appears to be less of a concern for foreign-owned companies and enterprises that have higher shares of euro-denominated receivables and <b>invoice</b> <b>exports</b> in the Polish zloty. Companies competing by means of product quality and distribution channels are also among those less vulnerable to exchange rate risk. Generally, we have confirmed the problem of exchange rate risk as an important cost to export activity. This gives some implications for exchange rate risk management at both the macroeconomic and microeconomic levels as well as for monetary integration. exchange rate risk, exports, empirical studies, trad...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{association}} between commercial and financial openness of developing countries. The data suggest that, controlling for GDP/Capita changes and allowing for country specific effects, increase in a developing country's (exports + imports) /GDP {{is associated with a}} highly significant increase in financial openness [measured by (gross private capital inflows + gross private outflows) /GDP]. I outline a model accounting for some of the endogenous linkages between financial and trade openness. I show that developing countries, characterized by high costs of tax collection and enforcement, opt to use financial repression as an implicit tax on savings. The resultant financial repression provides the impetus for capital flight. A frequent mechanism facilitating illicit capital movements is to over invoice imports and under <b>invoice</b> <b>exports</b> with the scale of these activities being proportional to the commercial openness of the economy. This linkage is subject to costly control by the fiscal authorities, where curtailing illicit capital flows requires spending resources on monitoring and enforcement of existing capital controls. The effectiveness of capital controls would increase with the resources spent on monitoring and enforcement per one dollar of international trade. Under these circumstances, greater commercial openness increases the effective cost of enforcing financial repression, thereby reducing the usefulness of financial repression as an implicit tax. This in turn implies that financial reforms tend to be the by-product of greater trade integration. ...|$|R

40|$|In these essays, I examine quantitatively some of {{the classic}} {{questions}} {{in the field of}} International Economics: What is the impact of international trade on consumption and productivity? How does international trade affect income inequality? How do exchange rates movements affect real output and productivity? This dissertation is composed of three chapters, each covering one of these topics. The first chapter, based on my paper "Measured Gains from International Trade" with Ariel Burstein, revisits the measurement of welfare gains from trade liberalizations. Economists so far have measured these gains using one of two alternative approaches. A first approach uses structural models to infer unobservable welfare gains from changes in trade costs or in trade patterns. A second approach documents the empirical link between the level or the change in international trade and aggregate indicators of economic activity. This chapter connects these two approaches by studying the relationship between the theoretical welfare gains from trade and observable aggregate measures of economic activity, such as real GDP and real consumption, as constructed by national statistical agencies. Across a wide range of models, we find that measured real GDP and productivity rise in response to reductions in variable trade costs if GDP deflators capture the decline in trade costs. On the other hand, welfare gains from tariffs reductions are only reflected on real GDP if tariff revenues at constant prices rise. The second chapter analyzes the impact of capital equipment imports on income inequality across 53 countries. The chapter is based on my paper "Importing Skill Biased Technology" with Ariel Burstein and Jonathan Vogel. Capital equipment, such as computers and industrial machinery, is mostly operated by skilled workers and generally takes on routine tasks that are otherwise performed by unskilled workers. When a country imports capital equipment, it raises the relative demand of skilled versus unskilled workers, increasing income inequality. The chapter develops a tractable model of international trade in capital goods to quantify these effects. In doing so, it provides sufficient statistics and transparent formulas that will enable development practitioners to independently assess how trade in capital goods affects income inequality. We estimate that imports of equipment account for 16 percent of the income gap between skilled and unskilled workers in the median country in our sample, and for a much larger magnitude in economies that heavily rely on imported capital equipment. We also show that imports of capital equipment are essential to increase productivity and income in developing countries, both for skilled and unskilled workers, although my findings suggest these imports will disproportionately benefit the skilled segment of the population. In the third chapter, "Exchange Rates, Aggregate Productivity and the Currency of Invoicing of International Trade", I use a novel dataset on prices and quantities from Chilean customs and a model of international prices with nominal rigidities to study how movements in nominal exchange rates can impact aggregate output and productivity. Empirically, I show that export prices are rigid in the currency in which <b>exports</b> are <b>invoiced,</b> so the relative price of firms invoicing in different currencies fluctuates with the exchange rate. I exploit this feature of the data to estimate how quantities of firms invoicing in different currencies selling in a common destination move with the exchange rate. I find this elasticity to be low, indicating that exchange rate movements have limited expenditure switching effects. I then ask how the observed variation in markups generated by exchange rate movements affects aggregate productivity by affecting the allocation of production across firms. Guided by a quantitative open economy model disciplined by some features of my data, I show that a 10 percent change in the exchange rate changes productivity in the tradable sector by 0. 5 percent. Alternative parameterizations that do not account for the observed heterogeneity in invoicing predict changes in productivity at least five times smaller. This implies that taking heterogeneity into account is key for understanding the quantitative effects of exchange rates on productivity...|$|R
