50|$|Dried {{vine fruit}} {{is a term}} given to all the {{varieties}} of <b>dried</b> <b>grape</b> produced. The need for this term came {{from the fact that}} the United Kingdom is the only country in the European Union which differentiates dried vine fruit into different types. On mainland Europe, they are all simply called raisins, whereas in the UK they are differentiated into raisins, sultanas and currants. In this instance the term currant refers to the Zante currant, not the fruit of the Ribes genus.|$|E

2500|$|In most of Europe and North America, <b>dried</b> <b>grapes</b> are {{referred}} to as [...] "raisins" [...] or the local equivalent. In the UK, three different varieties are recognized, forcing the EU to use the term [...] "dried vine fruit" [...] in official documents.|$|R
50|$|There are {{indications}} that frozen grapes were used to make wine in Roman times. Pliny the Elder (AD 23 - 79) wrote that certain grape varieties were not harvested before the first frost had occurred. The poet Martial recommended that grapes should be left on the vine until November or until they were stiff with frost. Details as to the winemaking and description of these wines are unknown. It cannot be completely ruled out that the descriptions refer to <b>dried</b> <b>grape</b> wines, a common style of wine in Roman times, where the raisin-like grapes were harvested late enough for the first frost to have fallen. In either case, the method seems later to have been forgotten. Wine from Chiomonte in the Val di Susa was popular in Roman times and this town still today produces one of Italy's few ice wines.|$|E
50|$|Black rot is {{a disease}} {{estimated}} to affect 95% of all eastern grape vineyards. The USDA estimates it could reduce yields by 85% if left untreated. Black rot is spread through spores left in the mummied grapes infected the year before. Upon infection the grapes shrivel up and turn black. These grapes do not fall from the vine but stay attached, and over winter spores grow within the infected grape. When summer comes the rain re-moistens the <b>dried</b> <b>grape</b> and causes it to swell. Spores discharge from the swollen grape {{into the air and}} infect the healthy crop. Prior to fungicide development for black rot, in conditions favorable to the disease losses of 70 to 100 percent of the crop were common. Today however applications of fungicides have been able to give almost complete control of the disease. In many vineyards infections can be reduced from 95% down to 1%.|$|E
50|$|Dessert wines {{range from}} {{slightly}} sweet (with less than 50 g/L of sugar) to incredibly sweet wines (with over 400 g/L of sugar). Late harvest wines such as Spätlese {{are made from}} grapes harvested well after they have reached maximum ripeness. <b>Dried</b> <b>grape</b> wines, such as Recioto and Vin Santo from Italy, are made from grapes that have been partially raisined after harvesting. Botrytized wines are made from grapes infected by the mold Botrytis cinerea or noble rot. These include Sauternes from Bordeaux, numerous wines from Loire such as Bonnezeaux and Quarts de Chaume, Tokaji Aszú from Hungary, and Beerenauslese. Ice Wine is made from grapes that are harvested while they are frozen. Fortified wines are often sweeter, and generally more alcoholic wines that have had their fermentation process stopped {{by the addition of}} a spirit, such as brandy, or have had additional spirit added after fermentation. Examples include Port, Madeira and Sherry.|$|E
50|$|A Danish winery, Vester Ulslev Vingaard, {{has made}} wine from <b>dried</b> <b>grapes</b> since 2007. The {{varieties}} used are Léon Millot and Cabernet Cantor. The <b>grapes</b> are <b>dried</b> for 4 - 5 weeks using forced ventilation. During {{that time the}} grapes lose up to 50% of their weight, the remaining juice being similarly more concentrated. The wines produced are red, dry wines {{with a level of}} alcohol of more than 15%.Vester Ulslev Vingaard sees the use of <b>dried</b> <b>grapes</b> as a means to make more powerful wines in a cool climate and also as a means to redress deficits in concentration and sugars in bad seasons. In 2010 a double-fermented (ripasso-method) wine was also produced using the pomace of the first wine.|$|R
40|$|During {{alcoholic}} {{fermentation of must}} from <b>dried</b> <b>grapes,</b> yeasts are subjected to very high sugar concentrations, besides other environmental stresses, and they modify their metabolic behaviour giving low ethanol yield and abnormally high acetic acid production. To investigate the protective effect of catechin, inositol, and SO 2 on wine yeasts, three ther-motolerant strains of Saccharomyces cerevisiae, selected for wine making of must from <b>dried</b> <b>grapes,</b> and three strains of Saccharomyces selected {{for the production of}} wine, were inocu-lated in a sample of must at very high osmotic strength. A significant (p< 0. 01 or p< 0. 05) relationship between the addition of 100 mg/L of catechin, inositol or SO 2 to the grape must and the change in the metabolic behaviour of the yeasts was observed. Compared to the control and depending on strain and protectant, the fermentation rate after 3 days in-creased up to 55 %, the ethanol content of the wines increased up to 16 %, the unitary suc-cinic acid production increased up to 55 %, the unitary acetic acid production decreased up to 53 %, and the unitary glycerol production decreased up to 69 %. So by adding cate-chin, inositol or SO 2 to the grape must it is possible to minimise the abnormal fermenta-tion performance that wine yeasts exhibit in wine making of must from <b>dried</b> <b>grapes.</b> Key words: metabolism, stress, wine yeas...|$|R

5000|$|The sultana is a [...] "white" [...] (pale green), oval {{seedless}} grape variety {{also called the}} sultanina, Thompson Seedless (United States), Lady de Coverly (England), and oval-fruited Kishmish (Iran, Turkey, Palestine). It is assumed to originate from the Levant (Asia Minor), which later {{became part of the}} Ottoman Empire. In some countries, especially Commonwealth countries, it is also the name given to the raisin made from it or from larger {{seedless grape}}s; such sultana raisins are often called simply sultanas or sultanis. These are typically larger than Zante currants (which are also a kind of <b>dried</b> <b>grape,</b> not currants in the botanical sense), and the Thompson variety is smaller than many seeded raisins. In the US and Canada, the name [...] "raisin" [...] is applied to all dried grapes, so that the breakfast cereal known as [...] "sultana bran" [...] in Australia and the United Kingdom is called raisin bran in the United States and Canada.|$|E
5000|$|The teenaged ruler {{set out to}} {{turn the}} city into an {{intellectual}} center for the empire. Between 1417 and 1420, he built a madrasa ("university" [...] or [...] "institute") on Registan Square in Samarkand (currently in Uzbekistan), and he invited numerous Islamic astronomers and mathematicians to study there. The madrasa building still survives. Ulugh Beg's most famous pupil in astronomy was Ali Qushchi (died in 1474).He was also famous {{in the fields of}} medicine and poetry. He used to debate with other poets about contemporary social issues. He liked to debate in a poetic style, called [...] "Bahribayt" [...] among local poets. According to the medical book [...] "Mashkovskiy" [...] which is in the Russian language, Ulugh Beg discovered the mixture of alcohol with garlic, apparently preserving it to help treat conditions like diarrhea, headache, stomach ache and intestine illnesses. He also offered advice for newly married couples: Indicating recipes contains nuts, dried apricot, <b>dried</b> <b>grape</b> etc. that he claimed to be useful to increase men`s virility. This recipe has been given in Ibn Sina`s books also.|$|E
5000|$|A <b>dried</b> <b>grape</b> wine {{known as}} the Cypriot Manna was {{described}} in 800 BC by the Greek poet Hesiod. Similar principles were {{used to make the}} medieval Cypriot wine Commandaria, which is still produced today. Various Mediterranean raisin wines were described in the first century AD by Columella and Pliny the Elder. Pliny uses the Greek term for honey wine for the following raisin wine, [...] "The grapes are left on the vine to dry in the sun...It is made by drying grapes in the sun, and then placing them for seven days in a closed place upon hurdles, some seven feet from the ground, care being taken to protect them at night from the dews: on the eighth day they are trodden out: this method, it is said, produces a liquor of exquisite bouquet and flavour. The liquor known as melitites {{is also one of the}} sweet wines." [...] Columella discusses the Passum wine made in ancient Carthage. The modern Italian name for this wine, passito, echoes this ancient word, as does the French word used to describe the process of producing straw wines, passerillage. Perhaps the closest thing to passum is Moscato Passito di Pantelleria from Zibibbo, a variety of the ancient muscat grape, produced on Pantelleria, an island in the Strait of Sicily (50 miles from Tunisia) opposite to where Carthage used to be.|$|E
