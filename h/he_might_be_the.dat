25|$|For {{a couple}} of years in the late 1940s, Tremlett looked as though <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> answer to some of England's post-war cricketing woes. A tall, curly-haired all-rounder, Tremlett had a whippy fast-medium bowling action that moved the ball off the pitch and was a pugnacious {{right-handed}} batsman, strong at driving.|$|E
25|$|As {{it turns}} out, {{most of those}} {{predictions}} were wrong. While Justice Burton harbored fears {{at one point that}} <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only Justice to vote against the government's position, he was encouraged by his private conversations with other Justices. In the end, the Court voted 6–3 to affirm the District Court's injunction barring the President from seizing the steel plants.|$|E
25|$|In Street Fighter IV, Guy {{was one of}} the new {{characters}} {{added in}} Super Street Fighter IV. In his ending, he is shown rescuing an unconscious Rose from Bison. In Rose's ending it is hinted that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only one powerful enough to stop Bison (though in Street Fighter V, Bison is destroyed once and for all by Ryu), and in Cody's ending Guy is shown trying to persuade him to come back {{on the right side of}} the law. Guy is also the one who threw the kunai in Fei Long's ending in the original Street Fighter IV, since Ibuki has no involvement with S.I.N.|$|E

25|$|The {{pressure}} on CP-led unions intensified {{after the end}} of World War II. These pressures fell especially hard on the TWU: the government arrested Santo for immigration law violations, and began proceedings to deport him. At the same time, Quill found the CP's political line increasingly hard to take, since it required him to oppose a subway fare increase that he considered necessary for wage increases in 1947, while the CP's support for the candidacy of Henry Wallace threatened to split the CIO. When William Z. Foster, then the general secretary of the CPUSA, told him that the party was prepared to split the CIO to form a third federation and that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> logical choice for its leader, Quill decided to break his ties to the CP instead.|$|E
25|$|The social status, {{duties and}} legal {{powers of the}} {{headmaster}} depended on the society in which he conducted his school. In a small school, <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only or the chief teacher. In a university-sized school {{he would be the}} director of the school, its museum, and its library. Plato as scholiarch owned his school, the land, {{and the rest of the}} property. He had to sponsor the resident foreigners, representing them at law. Aristotle at the foundation of the Lyceum was not, as a resident foreigner, allowed to own property in Athens. He rented the buildings and organized the students into an administration. Socrates was a voluntary consultant who conducted discussions at various times and places, some public, others contributed by interested persons.The scholiarchs of Alexandria were royal officers hired by the king.|$|E
25|$|Realization {{begins to}} slowly dawn in Scene II {{of the play}} when Jocasta {{mentions}} out of hand that Laius was slain {{at a place where}} three roads meet. This stirs something in Oedipus' memory and he suddenly remembers the men that he fought and killed one day long ago at a place where three roads met. He realizes, horrified, that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> man he's seeking. One household servant survived the attack and now lives out his old age in a frontier district of Thebes. Oedipus sends immediately for the man to either confirm or deny his guilt. At the very worst, though, he expects to find himself to be the unsuspecting murderer of a man unknown to him. The truth has not yet been made clear.|$|E

25|$|Alone, Vladimir is {{encountered}} by (apparently) the same boy from yesterday, though Vladimir wonders whether <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> other boy's brother. This time, Vladimir begins consciously realising the circular {{nature of his}} experiences: he even predicts exactly what the boy will say, involving the same speech about Godot not arriving today but surely tomorrow. Vladimir seems to reach a moment of revelation before furiously chasing the boy away, demanding that he be recognised {{the next time they}} meet. Estragon awakes and pulls his boots off again. He and Vladimir consider hanging themselves once more, but when they test the strength of Estragon's belt (hoping {{to use it as a}} noose), it breaks and Estragon's trousers fall down. They resolve tomorrow to bring a more suitable piece of rope and, if Godot fails to arrive, to commit suicide at last. Again, they decide to clear out for the night, but, again, neither of them makes any attempt to move.|$|E
500|$|Since the 1960s, Gehry {{has made}} artistic use of scaled {{animals such as}} fish and snakes, which first {{appeared}} in his architectural designs in the 1980s. Many references to the bridge describe it as snakelike for its winding path, and some even refer to the stainless steel plates as scales with discussion of reptilian forms. Kamin calls it [...] "a bridge that resembles a giant silver snake, complete with a scaly skin", while Gehry {{said he thought the}} bridge looked like a river, but added <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> only one who thought that.|$|E
500|$|Ferb and his stepbrother Phineas Flynn {{spend their}} days during summer {{vacation}} from school striving to have fun. They are featured {{in the majority of}} episodes as the A-Plot constructing large scale inventions or taking part in other outlandish activities. Ferb, an engineering genius, allows Phineas to do most of the talking for the pair and is [...] "more of a man of action." [...] When Ferb does speak, it is almost always a single sentence. In a conversation in the future time of [...] "Phineas and Ferb's Quantum Boogaloo", it is revealed that he was at Camp David (hinting that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> current President of the United States, although his British background would presumably rule that out).|$|E

500|$|McCain also harshly criticized Obama for {{scrapping}} {{construction of}} the U.S. missile defense complex in Poland, declined to enter negotiations over climate change legislation similar {{to what he had}} proposed in the past, and strongly opposed the Obama health care plan. McCain led a successful filibuster of a measure that would allow repeal of the military's [...] "Don't ask, don't tell" [...] policy towards gays. Factors involved in McCain's new direction included Senate staffers leaving, a renewed concern over national debt levels and the scope of federal government, a possible Republican primary challenge from conservatives in 2010, and McCain's campaign edge being slow to wear off. As one longtime McCain advisor said, [...] "A lot of people, including me, thought <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Republican building bridges to the Obama Administration.

500|$|Don Perry guest starred as an {{airplane}} passenger next to Jerry, when {{he wakes up}} from his nightmare. Perry states that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> last person Jerry will see alive. This line {{was not in the}} original script, but was added because Perry, as Charles explained, [...] "just had the right look". Christine Dunford was cast as Leslie, Charles commented [...] "she just came in; gave a great reading. At this point in our show business history, I don't think we knew anybody". Dunford would return later as a saleswoman in the season five episode [...] "The Pie". Margaret Reed, best known for her role on the soap opera As the World Turns, appeared as Mary Cantardi, a woman who screams at Jerry for not calling her back after a date. Vic Polizos and James Lashly guest-starred as the Russian cable installers. Norman Brenner, who worked as Richards' stand-in on the show for all its nine seasons, appears as an extra in the first scene of the episode, standing at the counter at Monk's Cafe.|$|E
500|$|Nothing {{is known}} of Abdallah al-Battal's origin or early life. Much later {{accounts}} claim that he hailed from Antioch or Damascus, {{and that he was}} a mawla of the Umayyad family. He is also given various kunya, Abu Muhammad, Abu Yahya, or Abu 'l-Husayn, by which he is usually known. The use of the nisba of al-Antaqi ("of Antioch") rather than a tribal affiliation suggests that he may not have been of Arab origin; in this context, his name [...] "Abdallah" [...] further suggests that he was a convert to Islam, as this name (meaning [...] "servant of Allah") was often given to new converts in early Islamic times. Khalid Yahya Blankinship suggested that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> same person as a certain [...] "'Amr" [...] recorded by the Byzantine chronicler Theophanes the Confessor in the Nicaea campaign of 727, and hence that [...] "'Amr" [...] could be his actual personal name or a patronymic (i.e. his name could be 'Amr ibn Abdallah or Abdallah ibn 'Amr), while alternatively [...] "Abdallah" [...] could simply be an honorific.|$|E

[...] Like Orlando, Ratcliffe also felt that [...] "Goodwin and Dallas hit a perfect rhythm every time they share the screen," [...] but expressed concern about how the series would continue cutting between both worlds. Shaunna Murphy of Entertainment Weekly cited [...] "Snow Falls" [...] {{as evidence that the}} show was continuing down the [...] "fortunate path of getting better each week." [...] Murphy was interested in Sheriff Graham, speculating that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> Huntsman from Snow White, which would be a [...] "good, complicated role for him." [...] The A.V. Club reviewer Oliver Sava was less positive, giving the episode a grade of C-. He was pleased the plot moved forward, but felt the execution did not work; he cited the [...] "major problems" [...] of [...] "the lack of any sort of subtlety, nonsensical story developments, and Henry." [...] Sava derided the [...] "corny dialogue" [...] and use of flashbacks, but wrote that the [...] "best thing" [...] about the episode was the introduction of Dr. Whale and Kathryn Nolan, and also praised the acting.|$|E
500|$|As {{had been}} the {{practice}} since the Reunion Tour in 1999, Springsteen and the band began rehearsals at Asbury Park Convention Hall. [...] Beginning on March 11, some of the Springsteen faithful listened outside closed doors for what songs and arrangements the tour might bring. [...] The presence of Max Weinberg's 18-year-old son Jay, a freshman at Stevens Institute of Technology and also a drummer, at rehearsals indicated that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one to replace his father for European leg shows where Tonight Show duties came into play. [...] On one occasion on the Magic Tour, Jay Weinberg had sat in on drums for [...] "Born to Run". [...] This was confirmed by Springsteen on March 20, who said that Jay Weinberg would be drumming at {{a small number of}} shows during the tour. [...] Springsteen added, [...] "Once again, I want to express my appreciation to Conan O'Brien, and everyone on his team, for making it possible for Max to continue to do double duty for both us and for him. [...] We promise to return him in one piece." [...] Van Zandt said, [...] "I’ve been avoiding this question for weeks! Thank God they finally announced it. We already did three days of rehearsals.

500|$|The {{first season}} of Dexter {{is based on}} the novel Darkly Dreaming Dexter by Jeff Lindsay. However, there are {{numerous}} differences, ranging from extra subplots to rearrangements and modifications of elements from the source material. The biggest change is the lead-up to and revelation of the identity of the [...] "Ice Truck Killer", called the [...] "Tamiami Butcher" [...] in the novel. In the novel, Dexter is led to believe that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> one committing the murders, due to a series of strange dreams that connect him to the murder. The final clue is a blurry photo, taken from surveillance footage, of a man who resembles Dexter at a crime scene. After the [...] "Tamiami Killer" [...] kidnaps Deborah, Dexter finds and confronts him. It is subsequently revealed that the killer is actually Dexter's nearly identical long-lost brother, Brian, who, like Dexter, witnessed their mother's brutal murder. Dexter is followed by Detective LaGuerta, who is slain by Brian. Debra finds out her brother is a killer and Dexter helps Brian to escape. In the television series, Brian is introduced under the fake name Rudy, a prosthetist who becomes Debra's boyfriend. Dexter hesitantly kills Brian instead of letting him escape, Debra does not discover her brother's secret, and LaGuerta is not present at all in the confrontation. In the novel, Dexter and his brother are nearly identical, whereas the actors playing the two characters are distinct from each other in their looks.|$|E

Subsequently, on Odell's recommendation, Irvine was invited to join the forthcoming third British Mount Everest expedition on the grounds that <b>he</b> <b>might</b> <b>be</b> <b>the</b> [...] "superman" [...] that the expedition felt it needed.
