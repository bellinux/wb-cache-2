50|$|NASA Langley Research Center (LaRC) {{originated}} (EBF3) technology development. The {{additive manufacturing}} process was primarily developed and engineered by Karen Taminger, material research engineer for NASA LaRC. EBF3 is a NASA-patented additive manufacturing process designed to build near-net-shape parts requiring less raw material and <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> than traditional manufacturing methods. EBF3 {{is a process}} by which NASA plans to build metal parts in zero-gravity environments; this layer-additive process uses an electron beam and a solid wire feedstock to fabricate metallic structures. The process efficiencies of the electron beam and the feedstock make the EBF3 process appropriate for in-space use. Since 2000, {{a team of researchers}} at the NASA LaRC have led the fundamental research and development of this technique for additive manufacturing for metallic aerospace structures. Additive manufacturing encompasses processes in which parts are built by successively adding material rather than by cutting or grinding it away as in conventional machining. Additive manufacturing is an outgrowth of rapid-prototyping techniques such as stereolithography, first developed for non-structural plastic parts over 30 years ago.|$|E
5000|$|The {{operational}} concept of EBF3 {{is to build}} a near-net-shape metal part directly from a computer-aided design (CAD) file. Current computer-aided machining practices start with a CAD model and use a post-processor to write the machining instructions (G-code) defining the cutting tool paths needed to make the part. EBF3 uses a similar process, starting with a CAD model, numerically slicing it into layers, then using a post-processor to write the G-code defining the deposition path and process parameters for the EBF3 equipment. It uses a focused electron beam in a vacuum environment to create a molten pool on a metallic substrate. The beam is translated with respect {{to the surface of the}} substrate while metal wire is fed into the molten pool. The deposit solidifies immediately after the electron beam has passed, having sufficient structural strength to support itself. The sequence is repeated in a layer-additive manner to produce a near-net-shape part needing only <b>finish</b> <b>machining.</b> The EBF3 process is scalable for components from fractions of an inch to tens of feet in size, limited mainly by the size of the vacuum chamber and amount of wire feedstock available.|$|E

40|$|There are {{a variety}} of {{precision}} mechanical components such as bearings, fuel injectors and gears, which are made of hardened steels, and have to be machined to a high degree of precision. Because of the stringent performance and functional requirements for these components, surface quality in terms of surface topography, microhardness, microstructure, and residual stresses must be specified and achieved through the appropriate manufacturing process sequence. The availability of hard cubic boron nitride (CBN) cutting tools has opened up the possibility of achieving these requirements by a <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> process, while requiring little or no grinding. A study has been made of the nature of surfaces of M 2 high speed steel produced by <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> with CBN tools. This has involved measurement of forces, surface finish, residual stresses, form errors and metallurgical changes associated with CBN turning of hard steels. The force measurements have enabled a characterization of the mechanics of the <b>finish</b> <b>machining</b> process in terms of the mechanical and thermal loads. It is found that the specific energy for machining M 2 steel is around 7 Joules/mm 3 which is ten times smaller than that found in grinding. Using forces, an estimate has been made of the friction coefficient at the tool-chip interface and the shear plane temperature. The surface finish and form measurements show that roughness values down to 0. 13 μ m Ra, and straightness, roundness, cylindricity, and parallelism values of 1 μm or smaller can be attained through the proper selection of process parameters. Various aspects of machining residual stresses have been investigated such as the effect of process parameters on the stress state, principal stresses, repeatability of the process in the context of residual stress generation and the evolution of residual stresses from heat treatment through to <b>finish</b> <b>machining.</b> A qualitative correlation has been established between work surface temperature and the residual stress state, just as in the grinding of hardened steels.
