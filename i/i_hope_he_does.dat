500|$|The [...] "Bale Out" [...] mashup {{incorporates}} audio {{clips of}} Bale lashing out, and Hurlbut responding [...] "I {{was looking at}} the lights." [...] The chorus includes a clip of Bale saying [...] "it's fucking distracting", and [...] "What don't you fuckin' understand?". The sound collage includes clips of Barbra Streisand from a 2006 exchange with a supporter of former-President George W. Bush, making it sound as though Streisand is arguing with Bale. Piane told the Associated Press: [...] "I don't know if Christian Bale is enjoying it, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> I think I've taken something that maybe made him look really bad and turned it into something that all these people are enjoying." ...|$|E
2500|$|Tasmania toured Zimbabwe {{for five}} games {{ahead of the}} 1995–96 Sheffield Shield. Ponting struggled, {{aggregating}} 99 runs at a modest 24.75. By the end of October, he had {{signed a contract with}} the Australian Cricket Board, along with 22 other Australian cricketers. [...] He opened the batting with Boon in Tasmania's first match of the Sheffield Shield season, scoring 20 and 43. Ahead of the following match against Queensland in Hobart, Ponting set himself a goal of scoring a century in each innings; a feat he achieved in a high-scoring draw. His form continued against the touring Sri Lankans in a one-day game in Devonport, scoring 99. He scored another century against the same opposition in Launceston. During the match, the public address system at the NTCA Ground announced that Ponting was making his Test debut against Sri Lanka in Perth on 8 December. The following morning saw local newspaper The Examiner headline: [...] "He's Ricky Ponting, he's ours ... and he's made it! Tassie's batting star will play in his first Test." [...] Marsh continued his praise of Ponting, who replaced a dropped Blewett. [...] "I have no doubt Ricky will be trying to get 100 in his first Test game. And <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> You'd back him to. If Ricky carries with him the same attitude that he has seen him succeed at First-class cricket to the next level {{there is no reason why}} he will not continue to score." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "And so do I," [...] added Tom. [...] "Poor chap, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> {{make a man}} of himself." [...] It was a {{long time}} before they saw Dan Baxter again.|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes;--Mr. Greystock. He {{has asked}} me. He has {{asked me to}} be his wife. I thought <b>he</b> loved me. <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did,</b> at least. Oh dear, <b>I</b> did so <b>hope</b> it! And <b>he</b> does!" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{was afraid}} for John and Armine, for {{we have been}} unsettled, and I could not go on so {{steadily}} with them as before," [...] she said eagerly, but faltering a little. [...] "Armine told me he blundered in Phaedrus, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> fairly on the whole." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now by the Grasshopper and all {{the gods}} of Egypt I swear that in payment for this insult I will choke the Nile with {{the army of the}} Great King, and hang that knave to a pole from the prow of the royal ship." [...] Which last thing <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "It's not agreeable, is it?" [...] pursues Mr. Snagsby, {{coughing}} his cough of mild persuasion {{behind his}} hand. [...] "Mr. Krook ought {{to consider it}} in the rent. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does,</b> I am sure." ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Better {{to keep it}} secret till others tell it. Reserved {{knowledge}} is always reserved strength; and if the man, as <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not, intends evil to the Church, let him commit himself before you use your knowledge against him. True, {{you may have a}} scruple of conscience as to the lawfulness of allowing a sin which you might prevent. To me it seems that the sin lies in the will rather than in the deed, and that sometimes--I only say sometimes--it may be a means of saving the sinner to allow his root of iniquity to bear fruit, and fill him with his own devices.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Honour {{is a cold}} word. It is not honour, but love,--downright true, honest love. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> honour you. I {{believe you}} to be an honest, true woman; and, as he knows you well, he {{probably}} does honour you;--but I am speaking of love." [...] Again Clara was silent. She knew what should be her argument if she were determined to oppose her cousin's pleadings; and she knew also,--she thought she knew,--that she did intend to oppose them; {{but there was a}} coldness in the argument to which she was averse. [...] "You cannot be insensible to such love as that!" [...] said Mary, going on with the cause which she had in hand.|$|E
60|$|I {{told him}} {{nothing could be}} craving upon him, that he left no room for it; that <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not give merely to avoid the trouble of being importuned. I told him he might depend upon it that I should be reduced very low indeed before I offered to disturb him that way.|$|R
60|$|When I {{perceived}} (which I did, {{almost as}} soon) that jealousy was {{growing out of}} this, I liked this society still better. Had I not been subject to jealousy, and were the endurances to be all mine? No. Let him know what it was! I was delighted that he should know it; I was delighted that he should feel keenly, and <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I {{shall not}} wait for any opportunity," [...] said Morris. [...] "When I see the box I shall open it and destroy the monster, though there were a {{thousand}} men looking on, and if I am to be wiped out for it the next moment!" [...] I grasped his hand instinctively and found it as firm {{as a piece of}} steel. I think he understood my look. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|On {{the next}} morning there came a message {{to him as he}} was dressing. Mr. Wharton wished to speak to him. Would he come down before breakfast, or would he call on Mr. Wharton in Stone Buildings? He sent down word that he would do the latter at an hour he fixed, and then did not show himself in the breakfast-room till Mr. Wharton was gone. [...] "I've got to go to your father to-day," [...] he said to his wife, [...] "and I thought it best not to begin till we come to the regular business. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean to be unreasonable." [...] To this she made no answer. [...] "Of course you think the want of reason will be all on my side." ...|$|E
6000|$|I {{am sorry}} to say I {{have not yet been}} able to read Mr. Martineau’s [...] sermon, which I mean to do with care. I am, as you know, one [...] {{altogether}} attached to dogma, which I believe to be the skeleton [...] that carries the flesh, the blood, the life of the blessed thing [...] we call the Christian religion. But I do not believe that God’s [...] tender mercies are restricted to {{a small portion of the}} human [...] family. I dare not be responsible for Dr. Newman, nor would he [...] thank me; but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not so believe, and this the more [...] because I have lately been reading Dr. Manning’s letter to Dr. [...] Pusey; and, though Dr. Manning is far more exaggerated in his [...] religion than Dr. Newman, and seems to me almost to caricature it, [...] yet I think even he has by no means that limited view of the [...] mercies of God.|$|E
60|$|The strange illegal Votes declaring several eminent {{persons to}} be Enemies to the King and Kingdom, {{are not so}} strange, he says, but very justifiable. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean, that illegal Votes are now not strange in the House of Commons: But observe the reason which he gives: for the House of Commons had before address'd for their removal from about the King. It was his {{business}} to have prov'd, that an Address of the House of Commons, without Process, order of Law, hearing any Defence, or offering any proof against them is sufficient ground to remove any person from the King: But instead of this he only proves, that former Addresses have been made, Which no body can deny. When he has throughly settled this important point, that Addresses have certainly been made, instead of an Argument to back it, he only thinks, that one may affirm by Law, That the King ought to have no person about him, who has the misfortune of such a Vote. But this is too ridiculous to require an Answer. They who will have a thing done, and give no reason for it, assume to themselves a manifest Arbitrary Power. Now this Power cannot be in the Representatives, if it be not in the People: or if it be in them, the People is absolute. But since he wholly thinks it, let him injoy the privilege of every Free Born Subject, to have the Bell clinck to him what he imagines.|$|E
6000|$|... "Poor Madalina!" [...] said Johnny. [...] "If <b>he</b> <b>does</b> beat her, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> will <b>do</b> it tenderly. It {{may be that}} {{a little}} of it will suit her fevered temperament." ...|$|R
60|$|He smiled, {{and said}} <b>he</b> <b>did</b> {{not tell me}} he had money. I took him up short, and told him <b>I</b> <b>hoped</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> not {{understand}} by my speaking, that I should expect any supply from {{him if he had}} money; that, on the other hand, though I had not a great deal, yet I did not want, and while I had any I would rather add to him than weaken him in that article, seeing, whatever he had, I knew in the case of transportation he would have occasion of it all.|$|R
60|$|The old Battery out on {{the marshes}} was our place of study, and a broken slate and a short piece of slate-pencil were our {{educational}} implements: to which Joe always added a pipe of tobacco. I never knew Joe to remember anything from one Sunday to another, or to acquire, under my tuition, any piece of information whatever. Yet he would smoke his pipe at the Battery with a far more sagacious air than anywhere else,--even with a learned air,--as if he considered himself to be advancing immensely. Dear fellow, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>did.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... 'Poor Jem!' soliloquized Fitzjocelyn. 'At least, I am {{glad the}} trouble is love, not the Ordination. But as to his meaning! He gives me to {{understand}} that we are rivals--It is the most absurd thing I ever knew--I declare I don't know whether he means Mary or Isabel. I suppose he would consider Mary's fortune a barrier--No, she is too serene for his storms--worthy, most worthy--but she would hate to be worshipped in that wild way. Besides, I am done for in that quarter. No clashing there--! Nay, the other it can never be--after all his efforts to lash me up at Christmas. Yet, he was much with her, he made Clara sacrifice the clasp to her. Hm! She is an embodied romance, deserving to be raved about; while for poor dear Mary, it would be simply ridiculous. I wish I could guess--it is too absurd to doubt, and worse to ask; and, what's more, he would not stand it. If I did but know! I'm not so far gone yet, but that I could leave the field to him, if that would do him any good. Heigh ho! it would be en regle to begin to hate him, and be as jealous as Bluebeard; but there! I don't know which it is to be about, and one can't be jealous for two ladies at once, luckily, for it would be immensely troublesome, unless a good, hearty quarrel would be wholesome to revive his spirits. It is a bad time for it, though! Well, <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not mean Mary--I could not bear for her to be tormented by him. That other creature might reign over him like the full moon dispersing clouds. Well! this is the queerest predicament I ever heard of!' And on he wandered, almost as much diverted by the humour of the doubt, as annoyed by the dilemma.|$|E
60|$|The happy-go-lucky baby is just able to toddle; and I seldom pull up my curtain in {{the morning}} without seeing him at his window in his yellow flannel night-gown, {{taking a look at}} the weather. No matter whether it rains or shines, there he is, smiling and nodding, and looking so merry, that it is evident he has plenty of {{sunshine}} bottled up in his own little heart for private use. I depend on seeing him, and feel as if the world was not right until this golden little sun rises to shine upon me. He don't seem to have any one to take care of him, but trots about all day, and takes care of himself. Sometimes he is up in the chambers with the girl, while she makes beds, and he helps; then he takes a stroll into the parlour, and spins the gay curtain-tassels to his heart's content; next, he dives into the kitchen (<b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> not tumble downstairs, but I dare say he wouldn't mind if he did), and he gets pushed about by all the busy women, as they 'fly round.' I rather think it gets too hot for him there about dinner-time; for he often comes out into the yard for a walk at noon, and seems to find endless wonders and delights in the ash barrel, the water-but, two old flower-pots, and a little grass plat, in which he plants a choice variety of articles, in the firm faith they will come up in full bloom. I hope the big spoon and his own red shoe will sprout and appear before any trouble is made about their mysterious disappearance. At night I see a little shadow bobbing about on the curtain, and watch it, till with a parting glimpse at a sleepy face at the window, my small sun sets, and I leave him to his dreams.|$|E

6000|$|... "I think he'll take us along," [...] whispered Chet to Andy, on {{retiring}} for the night. [...] "And <b>I</b> sincerely <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does.</b> It {{may give}} me a chance to find out what became of the Betsey Andrews and my father." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Now, my lord, {{will you}} allow {{me for a}} moment?" [...] said Mr. Fenwick.

5000|$|On 15 May 2006, Small {{signed for}} Championship club Sheffield Wednesday for an {{undisclosed}} [...] "substantial" [...] transfer fee, signing a three-year contract. On signing Small, then Wednesday manager Paul Sturrock said, [...] "I've seen Wade several times {{over the last couple}} of years and he's our type of signing. He is very quick, can play in a variety of positions offensively and has high potential. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> very well for Sheffield Wednesday." ...|$|E
5000|$|Wayne {{supported}} Vice President Richard Nixon in {{the presidential}} election of 1960, but expressed his vision of patriotism when John F. Kennedy won the election: [...] "I didn't vote for him but he's my president, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> a good job." [...] He used his iconic star power to support conservative causes, including rallying support for the Vietnam War by producing, codirecting, and starring in the financially successful, critically panned The Green Berets (1968).|$|E
5000|$|In July 2015, Lapavitsas {{endorsed}} Jeremy Corbyn's {{campaign in}} the Labour Party leadership election. He said: [...] "If he succeeds - and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> - he's exactly what Britain could do with, what the Labour Party could do with. I {{think that would be}} a very important move for the rest of Europe and for Greece. It would give a boost to the kind of thinking that would be necessary in the rest of Europe that is so sadly lacking at the moment. It would be the best thing to come out of Britain for Europe in a long time." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "That will do, {{that will}} do, young lady. Too many sugarplums {{are not good}} for him. His music isn't bad, but <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> will <b>do</b> as well in more {{important}} things. Going? well, I'm much obliged to you, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> you'll come again. My respects to your mother. Good night, Doctor Jo." ...|$|R
50|$|Its exciting, pacy, nicely handled and its fun. Theres nothing worthy about it, and its all {{the better}} for that. And, I might add, its self-contained. Landy may well revisit these {{characters}} - <b>I</b> sincerely <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> - but its a pleasingly rounded tale, which is refreshing {{in these days of}} endless open-ended books of never-ending series.|$|R
6000|$|She didn't {{mind that}} for a moment. [...] "Well, I'm glad he had the grace to <b>do</b> so, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>did</b> it before you asked him any leading questions." [...] Without waiting to hear whether this was so or not, she went on, with an {{emphasis}} on the next word that almost blotted it out of the language, [...] "SHE came back to me almost the instant you were gone, and told me everything. She said she wanted to tell me last night, but she hadn't the courage, and this morning, when she saw that I was beginning to hint up to Mr. Kendricks a little, she hadn't the courage at all. I sent her straight off to telegraph for her father. She is behaving splendidly. And now, {{what are we going to}} do?" ...|$|R

5000|$|When Spider-Man {{is about}} to leave, Tim asks him who he really is. After some hesitation, Spider-Man takes off his mask, {{identifies}} himself as Peter Parker, and retells the fateful night when his negligence let Uncle Ben die, causing him to fight crime. The story does not change Tims admiration of his hero. A tearful Peter Parker embraces Tim (who refers to him as [...] "Pete") and departs. An exterior view reveals Tim is staying in a cancer clinic. The last of the newspaper captions states that the boys only wish is to meet his hero in person. Conover ends his report by stating his hope that [...] "Spider-Man takes the time to visit a very brave young man named Tim Harrison, and <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> it soon.

5000|$|David Veloz, {{associate}} producer Richard Rutowski, and Stone rewrote the script, keeping much of {{the dialogue}} but changing {{the focus of the}} film from journalist Wayne Gale to Mickey and Mallory. The script was changed so much that as per WGA rules, Tarantino was credited for the film's story only. In a 1993 interview, Tarantino stated that he did not hold any animosity towards Stone, and that he wished the film well; [...] "It's not going to be my movie, it's going to be Oliver Stone's, and God bless him. <b>I</b> <b>hope</b> <b>he</b> <b>does</b> a good job with it.
