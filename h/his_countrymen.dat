5|$|During this time, Alexander adopted some {{elements}} of Persian dress and customs at his court, notably the custom of proskynesis, either a symbolic kissing of the hand, or prostration on the ground, that Persians showed to their social superiors. The Greeks regarded the gesture as the province of deities and believed that Alexander meant to deify himself by requiring it. This cost him the sympathies of many of <b>his</b> <b>countrymen,</b> and he eventually abandoned it.|$|E
5|$|Graeme Smith is {{a retired}} South African cricketer who played {{international}} cricket between 2002 and 2014. In a career spanning 12 years, he made centuries (100 or more runs in a single innings) on 27 and 10 occasions in Test and One Day International (ODI) matches respectively. His tally of 37 international centuries places him only behind Jacques Kallis (62), Hashim Amla (53) and AB de Villiers (45) among <b>his</b> <b>countrymen,</b> as of October 2016.|$|E

5|$|On October 16, 1978, the Bishop of Kraków, Karol Wojtyła, {{was elected}} Pope John Paul II. A year later, {{during his first}} pilgrimage to Poland, his masses were {{attended}} by {{hundreds of thousands of}} <b>his</b> <b>countrymen.</b> The Pope called for the respecting of national and religious traditions and advocated for freedom and human rights, while denouncing violence. To many Poles, he represented a spiritual and moral force that could be set against brute material forces, he was a bellwether of change, and became an important symbol—and supporter—of changes to come.|$|E
5|$|Alvarado was {{attracted}} by reports of gold, and also wished {{to prevent the}} complete abandonment of the territory by the Spanish. He invaded Higueras in 1536, with 80 well-armed soldiers of mixed infantry and cavalry, accompanied by about 3000 indigenous Guatemalan auxiliaries; Many of the auxiliaries were Achi Maya warriors with a particularly fearsome reputation. He also brought Indian and African slaves to work the mines, as well as livestock to assist the colonisation effort. His route took him past a strong native fortress called the Peñol of Cerquín, where native warriors had amassed to resist the Spanish. Alvarado, seeing {{the strength of the}} fortress and aware of the pressing need to relieve Buena Esperanza, decided not to storm the fortress and pushed onwards to assist <b>his</b> <b>countrymen.</b>|$|E
5|$|Around the {{beginning}} of 1449, Branković imprisoned Hungarian regent John Hunyadi in the dungeons of the fortress until he was ransomed by <b>his</b> <b>countrymen.</b> In 1453, Sultan Mehmed II and Isak-bey Arbanazović led another attack on Smederevo {{as part of a}} devastating raid on Serbia. The Turks took 50,000 men, women and children during that raid, but Smederevo was well-led by Thomas Kantakouzenos. Despite having only 6,000 men, compared to the Ottomans' 20,000, the city withstood. Mehmed the Conqueror besieged Smederevo for the second time and the fortress was besieged by the Ottomans {{for the third time in}} 1456, being defended by Serbian forces. In 1459, Smederevo was captured by the Ottomans, leading to the end of the medieval Serbian state.|$|E

5|$|Foliot {{sent his}} nephew Richard Foliot and another clerk of his {{household}} to Bologna to study {{law in the}} 1160s, exemplifying the growing emphasis laid on Roman law among <b>his</b> <b>countrymen.</b> Another nephew was Ralph Foliot, Archdeacon of Hereford and a royal justice {{during the reign of}} Richard I. During his time at both dioceses, he did much to promote his relatives, and all of the archdeacons he appointed while at London were either nephews or other relatives. A member of his household at Hereford was the scholar Roger of Hereford, who dedicated his computus, or treatise on calculating dates, to Foliot. Another work, the Ysagoge in Theologiam, was dedicated to him by a writer named Odo while Foliot was still a prior in France.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi {{opposition}} to the Indian participation in the World War II was motivated by his belief that India could not be party to a war ostensibly being fought for democratic freedom while that freedom was denied to India itself. He also condemned Nazism and Fascism, a view which won endorsement of other Indian leaders. As the war progressed, Gandhi intensified his demand for independence, calling for the British to Quit India in a 1942 speech in Mumbai. This was Gandhi's and the Congress Party's most definitive revolt aimed at securing the British exit from India. The British government responded quickly to the Quit India speech, and within hours after Gandhi's speech arrested Gandhi and {{all the members of}} the Congress Working Committee. <b>His</b> <b>countrymen</b> retaliated the arrests by damaging or burning down hundreds of government owned railway stations, police stations, and cutting down telegraph wires.|$|E
5|$|Gandhi's arrest lasted two years, as he {{was held}} in the Aga Khan Palace in Pune. During this period, his long time {{secretary}} Mahadev Desai died of a heart attack, his wife Kasturba died after 18 months' imprisonment on 22 February 1944; and Gandhi suffered a severe malaria attack. While in Jail, he agreed to an interview with Stuart Gelder, a British journalist. Gelder then composed and released an interview summary, cabled it to the mainstream press, that announced sudden concessions Gandhi was willing to make, comments that shocked <b>his</b> <b>countrymen,</b> the Congress workers and even Gandhi. The latter two claimed that it distorted what Gandhi actually said on a range of topics and falsely repudiated the Quit India movement.|$|E

5|$|He {{appears to}} have {{believed}} himself a deity, or at least sought to deify himself. Olympias always insisted {{to him that he}} was the son of Zeus, a theory apparently confirmed to him by the oracle of Amun at Siwa. He began to identify himself as the son of Zeus-Ammon. Alexander adopted elements of Persian dress and customs at court, notably proskynesis, a practice of which Macedonians disapproved, and were loath to perform. This behaviour cost him the sympathies of many of <b>his</b> <b>countrymen.</b> However, Alexander also was a pragmatic ruler who understood the difficulties of ruling culturally disparate peoples, many of whom lived in kingdoms where the king was divine. Thus, rather than megalomania, his behaviour may simply have been a practical attempt at strengthening his rule and keeping his empire together.|$|E
5|$|In September 1943, word reached Bohr and {{his brother}} Harald that the Nazis {{considered}} their family to be Jewish, since their mother was Jewish, {{and that they were}} therefore in danger of being arrested. The Danish resistance helped Bohr and his wife escape by sea to Sweden on 29 September. The next day, Bohr persuaded King Gustaf V of Sweden to make public Sweden's willingness to provide asylum to Jewish refugees. On 2 October 1943, Swedish radio broadcast that Sweden was ready to offer asylum, and the mass rescue of the Danish Jews by their countrymen followed swiftly thereafter. Some historians claim that Bohr's actions led directly to the mass rescue, while others say that, though Bohr did all that he could for <b>his</b> <b>countrymen,</b> his actions were not a decisive influence on the wider events. Eventually, over 7,000 Danish Jews escaped to Sweden.|$|E
5|$|It {{has long}} been a matter of debate why the Renaissance began in Florence, and not {{elsewhere}} in Italy. Scholars have noted several features unique to Florentine cultural life that may have caused such a cultural movement. Many have emphasized the role played by the Medici, a banking family and later ducal ruling house, in patronizing and stimulating the arts. Lorenzo de' Medici (1449–1492) was the catalyst for an enormous amount of arts patronage, encouraging <b>his</b> <b>countrymen</b> to commission works from the leading artists of Florence, including Leonardo da Vinci, Sandro Botticelli, and Michelangelo Buonarroti. Works by Neri di Bicci, Botticelli, da Vinci and Filippino Lippi had been commissioned additionally by the convent di San Donato agli Scopeti of the Augustinians order in Florence.|$|E

5|$|The {{fact that}} Demosthenes fought {{at the battle}} of Chaeronea as a hoplite {{indicates}} that he lacked any military skills. According to historian Thomas Babington Macaulay, in his time the division between political and military offices was beginning to be strongly marked. Almost no politician, with the exception of Phocion, was at the same time an apt orator and a competent general. Demosthenes dealt in policies and ideas, and war was not his business. This contrast between Demosthenes's intellectual prowess and his deficiencies in terms of vigour, stamina, military skill and strategic vision is illustrated by the inscription <b>his</b> <b>countrymen</b> engraved on the base of his statue:* C.Carey, Aeschines, 12–14; K. Paparregopoulus, Ab, 396–398.|$|E
5|$|Though {{recognised}} {{as one of}} {{the leading}} goalkeepers of his era, he never played for his native country. Trautmann met with the German national coach, Sepp Herberger, in 1953, who explained that travel and political implications prevented him from selecting a player who was not readily available, and that he could only consider including Trautmann if he were playing in a German league. Consequently, Trautmann's international isolation prevented him from playing in the 1954 World Cup, in which <b>his</b> <b>countrymen</b> were victorious. Trautmann's only experience of international football came in 1960, when the Football League decided to include non-English players in the Football League representative team for the first time. Trautmann captained the League against the Irish League, and also played against the Italian League.|$|E
5|$|Upon his {{seizure of}} the Macedonian throne, Pyrrhus was {{approached}} by a Spartan Prince, Cleonymus who was serving as an officer in his army. The Spartan persuaded Pyrrhus to assist him in his plot to capture Sparta. Cleonymus' motives in wanting to attack Sparta were twofold. Firstly, he bore a grudge because <b>his</b> <b>countrymen</b> had overlooked him in favour of his nephew, Areus I when determining the successor of the Agiad throne. Plutarch, the Greek historian, attributed Cleonymus' non-selection as king to his violent disposition and arbitrariness. Moreover, Cleonymus had been slighted because his new wife, Chilonis, had been seduced by Areus' son, Arcotatus. These perceived insults spurred Cleonymus to leave Sparta and scheme to usurp the throne.|$|E

However, he managed to score the first ever point to Palauan Olympic wrestlers, since <b>his</b> <b>countryman</b> John Tarkong Jr. had failed to score any points four years earlier, as would <b>his</b> <b>countryman</b> Elgin Loren Elwais in Greco-Roman -55 kg category.|$|R
5|$|After Ecgric {{had been}} ruling alone for two years, East Anglia was {{attacked}} by a Mercian army, led by Penda. The date of the invasion is usually given as around 636, although Kirby suggests {{it could have been}} so late as 641. Ecgric was sufficiently forewarned as to be able to gather an army, described by Bede as opimus or splendid. Realising that they would be inferior in battle to the war-hardened Mercians and remembering that Sigeberht was once their most vigorous and distinguished leader, the East Anglians urged him to lead them in battle, hoping that his presence would encourage them not to flee from the Mercians. After he refused, on account of his religious calling, he was borne off against his will to the battlefield. He refused to bear weapons and so was killed. Ecgric was also slain during the battle and many of <b>his</b> <b>countrymen</b> either perished or were put to flight. The location of the site of the battle in which the East Anglians were routed and their king was killed is unknown, but it can be presumed to have been close to the kingdom’s western border with the Middle Angles.|$|E
5|$|Gibbs {{made his}} Test and ODI debuts in 1996 against India and Kenya respectively. However, {{it was only}} in 1999 that he made his first century, when he scored 125 against the West Indies, an ODI South Africa won at St George's Park, Port Elizabeth. He {{followed}} that with another century against Australia in the 1999 World Cup, although this time in a losing cause. In 2002, Gibbs made three centuries in consecutive innings, equaling a record that was previously held by two other players. He was denied a fourth successive century when he remained 97 not out against Bangladesh. His career-best score of 175, achieved against Australia, led South Africa to the most successful run-chase in the history of ODIs. Gibbs made a minimum of one century each year from 1999 to 2009. As of October 2015, he is jointly second with Hashim Amla (both with 21 centuries) in the number of ODI centuries among <b>his</b> <b>countrymen,</b> only behind AB de Villiers (22).|$|E
5|$|The forces {{under his}} command, known as L Force, campaigned in Libya in 1943, covered the Eighth Army's inland flank during its advance into Tunisia, {{and participated in}} {{the attack on the}} Mareth Line. L Force was then {{transformed}} into the 2e Division Blindée, although it was often referred to as La Division Leclerc. It fought under Leclerc's command in the Battle of Normandy, and participated in the liberation of Paris and Strasbourg. After the end of World War II in Europe in May 1945, he was given command of the French Far East Expeditionary Corps (Corps expéditionnaire français en Extrême-Orient, CEFEO). He represented France at the surrender of the Japanese Empire in Tokyo Bay on 2 September 1945. He quickly perceived the necessity for a political solution to the nascent conflict in Indochina, but once again was ahead of <b>his</b> <b>countrymen,</b> and was recalled to France in 1946. He was killed in an air crash in Algeria in 1947.|$|E
