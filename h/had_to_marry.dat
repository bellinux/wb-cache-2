5|$|In 1923, Sargent married Eileen Laura Harding Horne (1898–1977), {{daughter}} of Frederick Horne of Drinkstone, Suffolk. Sargent's biographers differ on her background. Aldous states {{that she was}} a maid in domestic service, whereas Reid notes {{that she was a}} keen rider, with many friends in hunting circles, and that her uncle (who officiated at her wedding to Sargent) was rector of Drinkstone, Suffolk. According to Aldous, it was believed locally that Sargent <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> Horne, having made her pregnant. By 1926, the couple had two children, a daughter Pamela who died of polio in 1944, and a son Peter. Sargent was much affected by his daughter's death, and his recording of Elgar's The Dream of Gerontius in 1945 was an expression of his grief.|$|E
5|$|During a party, Marianne finds Willoughby, but {{he barely}} {{acknowledges}} their acquaintance. Marianne later learns {{that he is}} engaged to the wealthy Miss Grey and becomes inconsolable. Brandon calls on the Dashwoods and explains to Elinor that Willoughby seduced then abandoned his young ward, Eliza Williams, who has given birth to his child. Mrs. Ferrars (Jean Marsh) learns of Edward's engagement to Lucy and threatens to disinherit him unless he calls it off, but Edward refuses. Brandon later offers him a living on his estate at Delaford, which Edward gladly accepts. While staying with Mrs. Jennings' daughter, Marianne goes walking in a storm and collapses. Brandon finds her and brings her home, where she falls seriously ill with a fever. During Marianne's recovery, Willoughby comes to talk with Elinor. He insists that he loved Marianne and would have married her, but he <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> a rich woman because his aunt disowned him after learning of his behaviour toward Eliza. After Marianne recovers, the sisters return home and Marianne begins spending time at Delaford, eventually {{falling in love with}} Brandon. Elinor learns that Lucy Steele has become Mrs. Ferrars, and assumes that Lucy and Edward have married. However, Edward arrives at the cottage and explains to the Dashwoods that Lucy has wed his brother Robert (Leo Bill). Edward then declares his love to Elinor and proposes. They marry, as do Marianne and Brandon.|$|E

25|$|Probably {{between the}} end of 1149 and 1151, Agnes married with Prince Mstislav Iziaslavich of Pereyaslavl, eldest son of Grand Prince Iziaslav II of Kiev. The Chronicler Wincenty Kadłubek, who knew the Piast-Rurikids affinities, {{explicitly}} described in his Chronica Poloniae that Agnes was given to Mstislav as wife. Further confirmation of this fact where: Mstislav's eldest son was called nephew of Casimir II the Just, and the relationship existing between Roman the Great and Leszek the White is described as cousins in the second degree. In addition, Roman is named jątrwią (wife's brother), of Leszek in the Hypatian Codex. Therefore, is Mstislav <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> with any of Bolesław III's daughters, {{the only one who could}} marry was Agnes.|$|E
500|$|Athens is the {{city-state}} that is best documented, both {{in terms}} of epikleroi and in all aspects of legal history. Athenian law on epikleroi was attributed to Solon; women with no brothers <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> their nearest male relative on their paternal side of the family, starting with their father's brother and moving from there to the next nearest male relative on the paternal side. The historian John Gould notes that the order of relatives that were required to marry the epikleros coincided with the relatives required to avenge a murder. This set of relatives was known as the anchisteia (...) in Athens. The anchisteia was also the group of relatives who would inherit property in the absence of legal heirs. If there was more than one possible spouse in a set of relatives, the right to marry the epikleros went to the eldest one. The property that was inherited could also be in debt, which would not affect the epikleros status.|$|E
500|$|They {{set out on}} {{a journey}} to get away from Carmine, first going to a hotel near Niagara Falls. Hearing of this, Angelo assumed that Kevin wanted to win over Angelina, and sent over his friend Dino to [...] "break his legs". They fled to Angelo's fishing cabin on an island where a {{homeless}} man is living. It is later revealed to be Gloria's estranged husband Jeffrey who had been kidnapped and sent away by Angelo, but lost memory of it. Jeffrey stole their motor boat, leaving them stranded there. Angelina then finally revealed to Kevin that she was never pregnant and faked the ordeal so that he would fall in love with her. Dino arrives at the Island and nearly killed Kevin, but Angelina tells him he can't because she will be married to Kevin. Because of this, Kevin reluctantly <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> her at a ceremony in Glowarm because Angelo forced him. Kevin was extremely miserable and told Chloe that the marriage was a sham.|$|E

2500|$|The Ojibwe {{people were}} divided {{into a number of}} odoodeman (clans; singular: doodem) named {{primarily}} for animals and birds totems (pronounced doodem). The five original totems were Wawaazisii (Bullhead), Baswenaazhi ("Echo-maker", i.e., Crane), Aan'aawenh (Pintail Duck), Nooke ("Tender", i.e., Bear) and Moozwaanowe ("Little" [...] Moose-tail). The Crane totem was the most vocal among the Ojibwe, and the Bear was the largest – so large, that it was sub-divided into body parts such as the head, the ribs and the feet. Each clan had certain responsibilities among the people. People <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> a spouse from a different clan.|$|E
2500|$|Edward {{arranged}} a second marriage {{almost immediately after}} the death of Hartman. Gilbert de Clare, Earl of Gloucester, who was almost thirty years older than Joan and newly divorced, was his first choice. The earl resigned his lands to Edward upon agreeing to get them back when he married Joan, as well as agreed on a dower of two thousand silver marks. By the time all of these negotiations were finished, Joan was twelve years old. Gilbert de Clare became very enamored with Joan, and even though she <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him regardless of how she felt, he still tried to woo her. He bought her expensive gifts and clothing to try to win favor with her. The couple were married on 30 April 1290 at Westminster Abbey, and had four children together. They were: ...|$|E
2500|$|After the Mad War, {{the duke}} Francis II could not marry off his {{daughter}} Anne without the King of France's consent. Nonetheless, she married the Holy Roman Emperor in 1490, but {{this led to}} a severe crisis with France. Charles VIII of France besieged Rennes and had the marriage cancelled. He eventually married Anne of Brittany. After he died childless, the duchess <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> his heir and cousin Louis XII. Anne unsuccessfully tried to preserve Breton independence, but she died in 1514 and the union between the two crowns was formally carried out by Francis I in 1532. He granted several privileges to Brittany, such as exemption from the gabelle, a tax on salt which was very unpopular in France. [...] Under the Ancien Régime, Brittany and France were governed as separate countries under the same crown, so Breton aristocrats in the French royal court were classed as Princes étrangers (foreign princes).|$|E

2500|$|At {{the time}} of her brother’s death, Infanta Beatriz was looking forward to her wedding. While visiting Ostia, she was {{introduced}} to an Italian aristocrat, Alessandro Torlonia, 5th Prince di Civitella-Cesi. Torlonia, who had inherited large estates from his father in 1933, was the son of Marino, 4th Prince di Civitella-Cesi and Mary Elsie Moore, an American heiress. His family had acquired a fortune in the 18th and 19th centuries by administering the finances of the Vatican, receiving the title of Prince of Civitella-Cesi in 1803 from Pope Pius VII.Although Don Alessandro was a prince, he did not belong to a reigning or formerly reigning dynasty, so Beatriz <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry</b> him morganatically, renouncing her rights of succession to the throne of Spain. Alfonso XIII, realizing that the combination of the threat of hemophilia and their situation in exile would make it difficult for his daughters to find royal husbands, gave his consent to this union.|$|E
2500|$|In the {{beginning}} of Catherine's reign Paul was vital to her survival, being the living symbol of dynastic continuity. By 1772, as Paul was coming of age, he displayed desire {{to participate in the}} government, and thus became a contender for his mother's absolute power. Catherine devised a plan to remove Paul from any involvement in politics: Paul <b>had</b> <b>to</b> <b>marry,</b> retire to quiet family life and produce a son that might become a better candidate for succession. This son, future emperor Alexander I, was born in 1777, and Catherine eagerly prepared him for an illustrious future although she never elevated her choice to a level of monarch's written will. Paul, in his turn, grew more and more suspicious of anything done by his mother, and even almost boycotted Alexander's 1793 wedding ceremony. The political struggle between Catherine and Paul that initially [...] "had secret significance hidden from the uninitiated but known to the court" [...] became public and was well known in Saint Petersburg as well as in foreign courts.|$|E
