40|$|Abstract. This article {{examines}} the contribution of hedging to firm value {{and the cost of}} hedging in a unified framework. Optimal hedging and firm value are explicitly linked to firm risk, the type of debt covenants and the relative priority of the <b>hedging</b> <b>contract.</b> It is shown that in some cases hedging is possible only if the counterparty to the forward contract also holds {{a significant portion of the}} debt. Also, the spread in the <b>hedging</b> <b>contract</b> reduces the optimal amount of hedging to less than the minimum-variance hedge ratio. Among other results this article elucidates why some firms hedge using forward contracts while other firms hedge in the futures markets, as well as why higher priority forward contracts are more efficient hedging vehicles.

40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} optimal bidding {{strategy}} (supply function) for a generator offering power into a wholesale electricity market. The model has three characteristics: the uncertainties facing the generator are {{described by a}} single probability function, namely the market distribution function; the supply function to be chosen is nondecreasing but need not be smooth; the objective function is the expected profit which can be formulated as a Stieltjes integral along the generator's supply curve. In previous work the market distribution function has been assumed smooth, but in practice this assumption may not be satisfied. This paper focuses on {{the case that the}} market distribution function is not continuous, and hence an optimal supply function may not exist. We consider a modified optimization problem and show the existence of an optimal solution for this problem. Then we show constructively how such an optimum can be approximated with an epsilon-optimal supply function by undercutting when the generator does not hold a <b>hedging</b> <b>contract</b> (and possibly overcutting when the generator has a <b>hedging</b> <b>contract).</b> Our results substantially extend previous work on the market distribution model...|$|E

When a seller observes that the hedge {{is likely to}} become a liability for her, it reduces her incentives to exert unobservable risk-prevention effort. Hedging can thus generate endogenous counterparty risk. To avoid such risk, the protection buyer may prefer to give up some insurance to maintain the seller’s incentives. Variation margins, compelling the protection seller to liquidate some of her risky positions after bad news, relax the incentive problem.

40|$|This study {{investigates the}} extent to which {{predicted}} electricity spot prices from a statistical model, along with consensus forecasts issued by the Australian Financial Market Association (AFMA), provide unbiased price estimates of a forward contract price over a specified time to expiration. The statistical model is a regime switching time series model which is based on the dynamics of the market mechanism. To evaluate a price estimate, two criteria are utilized in order to conclude appropriateness for use in the marking-to-market process. First is the requirement that the predicted prices converge to the spot price at expiration of a <b>hedging</b> <b>contract.</b> The second criterion refers to the mis-pricing due to the price estimates over {{the days leading up to}} the contract expiration. Over the data period under consideration, the ranking of alternatives for generating price predictions is clear. On both criteria the Stevenson (2001) model is preferred. Of significance is the lack of support for the consensus (market) prices. They do not converge to the spot price at equilibrium and, further, they generate a considerable overvaluation of the risk management portfolio. ...|$|E

40|$|We analyze optimal <b>hedging</b> <b>contracts</b> {{and show}} that {{although}} hedging aims at sharing risk, {{it can lead to}} more risk-taking. News implying that a hedge is likely to be loss-making undermines the risk-prevention incentives of the protection seller. This incentive problem limits the capacity to share risks and generates endogenous counterparty risk. Optimal hedging can therefore lead to contagion from news about insured risks to the balance sheet of insurers. Such endogenous risk is more likely to materialize ex post when the ex ante probability of counterparty default is low. Variation margins emerge as an optimal mechanism to enhance risk-sharing capacity. Paradoxically, they can also induce more risk-taking.

40|$|In {{multi-purpose}} water systems, power asymmetry {{is often}} responsible of inefficient and inequitable water allocations. Climate Change and anthropogenic pressure {{are expected to}} exacerbate such disparities {{at the expense of}} already disadvantaged groups. The intervention of a third party, charged with redefining water sharing policies to give greater consideration to equity and social justice, may be desirable. Nevertheless, to be accepted by private actors, this interposition should be coupled with some form of compensation. For a public agency, compensation measures may be burdensome, especially when the allowance is triggered by natural events whose timing and magnitude are subject to uncertainty. In this context, index based insurance contracts may represent a viable alternative option and reduce the cost of achieving socially desirable outcomes. In this study we explore soft measures to achieve global change mitigation by designing a hybrid coordination mechanism composed of i) a direct normative constraint and ii) an indirect financial compensatory tool. The performance of an index-based insurance (i. e. <b>hedging)</b> <b>contract</b> {{to be used as a}} compensation tool is evaluated relative to more traditional alternatives. First, the performance of the status quo system, or baseline (BL), is contrasted to an idealized scenario in which a central planner (CP) maximizes global efficiency. Then, the CP management is analyzed in order to identify an efficient water rights redistribution to be legally imposed on the advantaged stakeholders in the BL scenario. Finally, a <b>hedging</b> <b>contract</b> is designed to compensate those stakeholders more negatively affected by the legal constraint. The approach is demonstrated on a multi-purpose water system in Italy, where different decision makers individually manage the same resource. The system is characterized by a manifest power asymmetry: the upstream users, i. e. hydropower companies, are free to release their stored water in time irrespective of the timing of downstream users, i. e. farmers, demands. This situation can lead to financial losses by the farmers, an already disadvantaged group, and, as demonstrated by previous work, lead the global system to underperform. Results suggest that financial hedging tools may offer a reliable and relatively inexpensive alternative to other forms of compensation, and thereby favor more equitable management of multi-purpose water systems characterized by power asymmetry. This finding is especially relevant in times where granting of licenses to use/withdrawal water are often being reviewed with attention to environmental protection and social justice issues...|$|E
40|$|Abstract in Undetermined Cash-Flow-at-Risk (CFaR) is {{the cash}} flow {{equivalent}} of Value-at-Risk (VaR), a measure widely {{used as the}} basis for risk management in financial institutions. Whereas VaR-based systems specify the maximum amount of total value a firm is expected to lose under most foreseeable conditions (for example, with a 99 % confidence level), CFaR-based systems determine the maximum shortfall of cash the firm is willing to tolerate. CFaR is gaining in popularity among industrial companies for much the same reasons VaR has succeeded with financial firms: it sums up all the company's risk exposures in a single number {{that can be used to}} guide corporate risk management decisions. The authors describe a six-step process for calculating a measure they call “exposure-based CFaR” and then demonstrate its application to Norsk Hydro, the Norwegian industrial conglomerate. Exposure-based CFaR involves the estimation of a set of exposure coefficients that provide information about how various macroeconomic and market variables are expected to affect the company's cash flow, while also accounting for interdependencies among such effects. The resulting model enables management to estimate the variability in corporate cash flow as a function of various risks, and to predict how a <b>hedging</b> <b>contract</b> or a change in financial structure will alter the company's risk profile...|$|E
40|$|In this paper, we derive {{and assess}} a {{framework}} in which a firm’s financial environment {{is an integral part}} of its hedging decisions. In the framework, the characteristics of firms in the network and their interconnections affect the firm’s risk management strategy through impact on contract cost and efficacy of protection. We apply the model to an investment fund’s decision making problem for transferring equity risk to a set of banks and obtain an a priori optimal hedging decision based on a risk-return tradeoff analysis. We find hedge costs greatly influence the fund’s choice of counterparties for contract: the cost advantage of a counterparty would award it a dominant role in the magnitude of protection sought from the counterparty. In the a posteriori analysis, we evaluate the hedge efficacy in terms of the counterparties ’ ability to honor the hedge contract. The counter-party risk is investigated by introducing network-caused default probability and recovery rate to our model. We find that the optimality of <b>hedging</b> <b>contract</b> in the a posteriori analysis depends on the corporate objective and risk measures. Firms focusing on minimizing variance of firm value might consider a small deviation from the a priori optimal strategy; while those focussed on lowering tail risk tend to stay with the a priori optimal strategy...|$|E

40|$|MCom (Management Accountancy), North-West University, Potchefstroom Campus, 2014 The revolutionisation of {{international}} economies and monetary systems {{has been taking}} place since the early 1970 s. This occurred due to the diminishing fixed exchange rate systems of, initially, the Gold Standard and subsequently the Bretton Woods System. The collapse of these systems, especially the Bretton Woods System, led to the almost free movement of exchange rates. The lack of restriction placed on the movement of currencies created volatile markets; which, in turn, gave rise to an innumerable amount of risks. In Correia, Holman and Jahreskog (2012) {{it was determined that}} an astonishing 74 % of non-financial firms in South Africa hedge foreign exchange risk (the risk of currency movement). The 10 % of firms which did not hedge any risks declared it was {{due to the lack of}} exposure to foreign exchange risks and that the cost of acquiring a <b>hedging</b> <b>contract,</b> in many cases, exceeded the contract’s benefits. In the aforementioned study it was also established that the extractive sector of South Africa is one of the industries referring from the use of hedges. The intention of this study is to improve the effectiveness of derivative instruments for companies in the extractive sector of South Africa exporting to the United States of America. South Africa is a large exporter and importer of goods, making it extremely important for market participants to determine the movement of the exchange rates. This estimates the amount of risk a company is willing to take and the amount of hedges they will use to protect themselves against inauspicious and adverse movements in the markets. Therefore, incorporated in this study is the use of risk management tools from the technical analysis to predict the exchange rates at which companies should have set their hedging contracts on specific dates. This analysis could enable companies to perform an internal control that is inexpensive and which reduces risks of foreign exporting. Master...|$|E
40|$|The {{acceptance}} of the nodal pricing system as a mechanism to organize wholesale power markets has exposed both generators and consumers to unprecedented volatile prices. Most of the volatility follows from the method for valuing congestion on the network. Generators and wholesale consumers pay or collect a charge depending on whether their actions cause or relieve congested bottlenecks on the grid. The charges {{vary according to the}} location of the injection (source-node) or withdrawal (sink-node) relative to the overall grid topography. Following Hogan (1992), a <b>hedging</b> <b>contract</b> called Financial Transmission Right (FTR) Obligation was introduced in most wholesale power markets. A FTR Obligation, designated in Megawatts, is defined by a source node and sink node. The holder of the contract is entitled (obligated) to a stream of cash flows that exactly offsets the volatile congestion charges. They are initially sold in an auction. ^ This thesis advances the understanding of the market for FTR Obligations. Two specific areas are addressed. Firstly, the format of the auction for initial sale of FTR Obligations is examined for possible inefficiencies. One such inefficiency – that the multi-round format creates an opportunity for acquiring a zero-payoff portfolio for net negative cost – is described. Secondly, this dissertation develops a method for consistently comparing the value of different source-sink node FTR Obligations. ^ 1. Auction Structure and Implications for Bidding Strategy. Congestion charges across the network are jointly determined. Among a subset of FTR Obligations, the relationship assumes a simple form. The thesis demonstrates that the dependency together with a particular auction format creates a profitable opportunity. Examination of the annual auction conducted by PJM Interconnection reveals that investors benefit from this opportunity through systematic bidding beyond first round. ^ 2. Valuing FTR Obligations. FTR Obligations are essentially non-hedgeable contracts. Owing to the joint determination of congestion charges, the values of FTR Obligations exhibit a structure. This thesis capitalizes on the dependence structure to relatively value FTR Obligations. By suitably depicting the common sources of uncertainty, the dissertation derives the parameters of individual contracts’ payoff distributions thus facilitating a consistent comparison among different source-sink FTR Obligations. ...|$|E
50|$|Fuel hedging is a {{contractual}} tool {{some large}} fuel consuming companies, such as airlines, cruise lines and trucking companies, use {{to reduce their}} exposure to volatile and potentially rising fuel costs. A fuel <b>hedge</b> <b>contract</b> is a futures contract that allows a fuel-consuming company to establish a fixed or capped cost, via a commodity swap or option. The companies enter into <b>hedging</b> <b>contracts</b> to mitigate their exposure to future fuel prices that may be higher than current prices and/or to establish a known fuel cost for budgeting purposes. If such a company buys a fuel swap {{and the price of}} fuel declines, the company will effectively be forced to pay an above-market rate for fuel. If the company buys a fuel call option and the price of fuel increases, the company will receive a return on the option that offsets their actual cost of fuel. If the company buys a fuel call option, which requires an upfront premium cost, much like insurance, and the price of fuel decreases, the company will not receive a return on the option but they will benefit from buying fuel at the then-lower cost.|$|R

To create incentive compatibility, banks must assume some of the entrepreneurial risks, e. g. by underwriting OTC <b>hedging</b> <b>contracts</b> or granting loans. The arising bankruptcy risk causes potential contagion. A conflict of interest emerges because banks prefer a diversified customer portfolio, whereas customers attach more importance to getting adequate contracts from the bank.

We identify three fundamental instruments for regulation...|$|R
