5|$|The author {{contrasts}} Regents of the University of California v. Bakke {{with the}} Supreme Court's 1971 decision in Griggs v. Duke Power Co., which ruled that employers {{did not have}} to willfully discriminate against employees to violate Title VII of the Civil Rights Act of 1964. Chief Justice Warren E. Burger wrote that certain standardized tests given by employers could be discriminatory, even <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not the employer's intent. Another case discussed by Heins is the 1980 Supreme Court decision in Fullilove v. Klutznick, wherein the court ruled constitutional a federal law requiring a percentage of funds for a building project to be used for minority workers.|$|E
5|$|The game {{received}} generally positive {{reviews from}} critics, who praised its approachable gameplay for newcomers and depth for veteran players. However, reviewers had mixed experiences with its online component, and found Arcade mode lacking in replay value. According to the game's producer, Ryota Niitsuma, development difficulties {{and a lack}} of Wii fighting games were the reasons for its platform exclusivity; however, multiple critics questioned <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the best choice. Capcom announced in April 2010 that the game was a commercial success.|$|E
5|$|By May 29, {{four days}} before the opening of the convention, trainloads upon trainloads of delegates, lobbyists, reporters, and {{campaign}} followers had arrived at the Union and Dearborn railway stations in Chicago. Candidate supporters channeled through the Chicago streets with daily parades and rallies. Pre-convention possible outcomes of the voting were published by a number of sources. One, from the Albany Evening Journal, predicted Blaine with 277 votes, Grant with 317, Sherman with 106, and 49 for the other candidates. All of these predicted candidate vote totals were short of the 379 needed to win. Many in Chicago knew that a victor, most probably Grant, would only be determined if the unit rule, which postulated that all delegates from a particular state must vote for the candidate preferred by that state's delegation, was to be in effect. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not the case, then a long deadlock would result until one side succumbed to the other.|$|E

5|$|In December 2013, {{three months}} after the work was {{originally}} scheduled to begin, the redevelopment was finally given the green light. The sports minister signed off on £31million to complete the project. The redevelopment finally got under way on 6 May 2014 after the 2013–14 domestic season had finished, eight months later than originally planned. The work is due to be completed in 2015. On 31 March 2015, the West Stand of the stadium was sealed off after cracks in the structure were discovered. Construction work related to the stadium redevelopment had been ongoing behind the stand in the weeks prior to the damage, but it was not known <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> directly related. Originally planned for refurbishment as part of the redevelopment, it was later decided that the West Stand would be demolished and eventually replaced.|$|E
5|$|In the 20th century, {{the populations}} of cheetah in India saw a drastic fall. The last {{physical}} evidence of the cheetah in India {{was thought to be}} three individuals, all shot by the Maharajah of Surguja (a man also noted for holding a record for shooting 1,360 tigers), in 1947 in eastern Madhya Pradesh, but a female was sighted in Koriya district, present-day Chhattisgarh, in 1951. During the early 2000s, scientists from the Centre for Cellular and Molecular Biology (CCMB), Hyderabad, proposed a plan to clone Asiatic cheetahs obtained from Iran. India asked Iran to transport one live pair to India, or, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not possible, allow them to collect sperm and eggs of the cheetah pair in Iran itself. However, Iran rejected both proposals.|$|E
5|$|On 10 October, the High Court {{ruled that}} the act passed at the joint sitting that gave the Australian Capital Territory (ACT) and the Northern Territory two {{senators}} each was valid. A half-Senate election needed to be held by June 1976; most senators-elect would take their seats on 1 July but the territorial senators, and those filling Field's and Bunton's seats would take their places at once. The ruling meant {{that it was possible}} for the ALP to gain a temporary majority in the Senate, at least until 1 July 1976. To do so, the ALP would have to win Field's and Bunton's seats, and one seat in each territory, and have the second ACT seat fall to either a Labor candidate or an independent, former Liberal Prime Minister John Gorton, now estranged from his party. If this happened, Labor would have an effective 33–31 margin, would be able to pass supply <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> still an issue, and also could pass electoral redistribution laws (which had been passed by the House, though twice defeated by the Senate) that would give it an advantage at the next election.|$|E

5|$|William {{may have}} hoped the English would {{surrender}} following his victory, {{but they did}} not. Instead, some of the English clergy and magnates nominated Edgar the Ætheling as king, though their support for Edgar was only lukewarm. After waiting a short while, William secured Dover, parts of Kent, and Canterbury, while also sending a force to capture Winchester, where the royal treasury was. These captures secured William's rear areas and also his line of retreat to Normandy, <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> needed. William then marched to Southwark, across the Thames from London, which he reached in late November. Next he led his forces around {{the south and west}} of London, burning along the way. He finally crossed the Thames at Wallingford in early December. Archbishop Stigand submitted to William there, and when the duke moved on to Berkhamsted soon afterwards, Edgar the Ætheling, Morcar, Edwin, and Archbishop Ealdred also submitted. William then sent forces into London to construct a castle; he was crowned at Westminster Abbey on Christmas Day 1066.|$|E

25|$|Although {{informal}} consultations {{started in}} late April, the main {{negotiations between the}} Soviet Union, Britain and France began in May.

25|$|Two {{years later}} (1453), {{at the age}} of twelve, Lê Nhân Tông was {{formally}} given the title of Emperor.

Attlee and Arthur Greenwood then joined the meeting, and when asked, they indicated that they must first consult their party (then in conference at Bournemouth), but it was unlikely they could serve in a government led by Chamberlain; they probably {{would be able to}} serve under some other Conservative.|$|E
25|$|The {{opinions}} of the Advocates General are advisory and do not bind the Court, but they are nonetheless very influential and are followed {{in the majority of}} cases. In a 2016 study, Arrebola and Mauricio measured the influence of the Advocate General on the judgments of the Court, showing that the Court is approximately 67% more likely to deliver a particular outcome <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the opinion of the Advocate General. As of 2003, Advocates General are only required to give an opinion if the Court considers the case raises a new point of law.|$|E
25|$|The {{debate in}} the media {{following}} the press conference was mostly about the open corners, if the surface should be grass or artificial turf, and what {{the name of the}} stadium should be. The contractor, Higabgruppen, were reluctant to close the corners of the stadium, claiming a very tight budget and possible growth problems for the grass <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> chosen as surface. The original plan was to demolish Gamla Ullevi after the 2005 season, and to open the new stadium {{at the beginning of the}} 2007 season, but the plan was delayed and Gamla Ullevi was not torn down in 2005.|$|E

25|$|During {{the last}} quarter of the eighteenth century, it became fashionable to view art {{galleries}} at night by torchlight. Canova was an artist that leapt on the fad and displayed his works of art in his studio by candlelight. As such, Canova would begin to finalize the statue with special tools by candlelight, to soften the transitions between the various parts of the nude. After a little recarving, he began to rub the statue down with pumice stone, sometimes for period longer that weeks or months. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> not enough, he would use tripoli (rottenstone) and lead.|$|E
25|$|The ground setting (GKX in {{the above}} example) should have been chosen at random, but Herivel {{reasoned}} that if operators were lazy, in a hurry or otherwise under pressure, they might simply use whatever rotor setting was currently showing on the machine. <b>If</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> the first message {{of the day and}} the operator had set the ring settings with the rotors already inside the machine, the rotor position currently showing on the machine could well be the ring setting itself or be very close to it.

25|$|Gorbachev {{continued}} to work on drafting a new treaty of union which would have created a truly voluntary federation in an increasingly democratised Soviet Union. The new treaty was strongly supported by the Central Asian republics, who needed the economic power and markets of the Soviet Union to prosper. However, the more radical reformists, such as Russian SFSR President Boris Yeltsin, were increasingly convinced that a rapid transition {{to a market economy}} was required and were more than happy to contemplate the disintegration of the Soviet Union <b>if</b> <b>that</b> <b>was</b> required to achieve their aims. Nevertheless, a referendum {{on the future of the}} Soviet Union was held in March (with a referendum in Russia on the creation of a presidency), which returned an average of 76.4% in the nine republics where it was taken, with a turnout of 80% of the adult population. Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, Armenia, Georgia and Moldova did not participate. Following this, an April meeting at Novo-Ogarevo between Gorbachev and the heads of the nine republics issued a statement on speeding up the creation of a new Union treaty.|$|E
