5|$|As {{its first}} {{enforcement}} legislation, Congress passed the Civil Rights Act of 1866, guaranteeing black Americans citizenship and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law, {{though not the}} right to vote. The amendment was also used as authorizing several Freedmen's Bureau bills. President Andrew Johnson vetoed these bills, but Congress overrode his vetoes to pass the Civil Rights Act and the Second Freedmen's Bureau Bill.|$|E
5|$|Article 12 of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore {{guarantees}} to all persons equality {{before the law}} and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. The Article also identifies four forbidden classifications – religion, race, descent and place of birth – upon which Singapore citizens may not be discriminated for specific reasons. For example, discrimination on those classifications is prohibited in the appointment to any office or employment under a public authority or {{in the administration of}} any law relating to the establishing or carrying on of any trade, business, profession, vocation or employment.|$|E
5|$|The Fourteenth Amendment (Amendment XIV) to the United States Constitution {{was adopted}} on July 9, 1868, {{as one of}} the Reconstruction Amendments. The {{amendment}} addresses citizenship rights and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws and was proposed in response to issues related to former slaves following the American Civil War. The amendment was bitterly contested, particularly by the states of the defeated Confederacy, which were forced to ratify it in order to regain representation in Congress.|$|E

5|$|Eng Foong Ho v. Attorney-General is {{the name}} of two cases of the Singapore courts, a High Court {{decision}} delivered in 2008 and the 2009 judgment by the Court of Appeal. The main issue raised by the case was whether the Collector of Land Revenue had treated the plaintiffs (later appellants), who were devotees of the Jin Long Si Temple, unequally by compulsorily acquiring for public purposes the land on which the temple stood but not the lands of a Hindu mission and a Christian church nearby. It was alleged that the authorities had acted in violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution of the Republic of Singapore, which guarantees the rights to equality before the law and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law.|$|E
5|$|The Supreme Court {{also decided}} whether foreign {{corporations}} are also within {{the jurisdiction of}} a state, ruling that a foreign corporation which sued in a state court {{in which it was}} not licensed to do business to recover possession of property wrongfully taken from it in another state was within the jurisdiction and could not be subjected to unequal burdens in the maintenance of the suit. When a state has admitted a foreign corporation to do business within its borders, that corporation is entitled to <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws but not necessarily to identical treatment with domestic corporations.|$|E
5|$|The appellants {{contended that}} the orders had been made without any notice or hearing, {{and they were not}} given an {{opportunity}} to explain or correct the allegations against them. This was contrary to natural justice, which requires a person to be given the right to be heard before his or her interest is violated. As natural justice is an essential aspect of both {{the rule of law and}} the equal treatment by the law of all persons, the appellants argued that the deprivation of their right to a fair hearing was a violation of Article 12(1) of the Constitution, which affords to all persons equality before the law and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law.|$|E

5|$|The Right to Equality {{is one of}} {{the chief}} {{guarantees}} of the Constitution. It is embodied in Articles 14–16, which collectively encompass the general principles of equality before law and non-discrimination, and Articles 17–18 which collectively encompass further the philosophy of social equality. Article 14 guarantees equality before law as well as <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law to all persons within the territory of India. This includes the equal subjection of all persons to the authority of law, as well as equal treatment of persons in similar circumstances. The latter permits the State to classify persons for legitimate purposes, provided there is a reasonable basis for the same, meaning that the classification is required to be non-arbitrary, based on a method of intelligible differentiation among those sought to be classified, as well as have a rational relation to the object sought to be achieved by the classification.|$|E

25|$|United States v. Antelope, , was a United States Supreme Court case {{in which}} the Court held that American Indians convicted on {{reservation}} land were not deprived of the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws; (a) the federal criminal statutes are not based on impermissible racial classifications but on political membership in an Indian tribe or nation; and (b) the challenged statutes do not violate equal protection. Indians or non-Indians can be charged with first-degree murder committed in a federal enclave.|$|E

25|$|All persons born or {{naturalized}} in the United States, {{and subject}} to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens of the United States and of the State wherein they reside. No State shall make or enforce any law which shall abridge the privileges or immunities of citizens of the United States; nor shall any State deprive any person of life, liberty, or property, without due process of law; nor deny to any person within its jurisdiction the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws.|$|E
25|$|Thus, {{although}} the Erie decision {{itself does not}} identify specific provisions of the Constitution violated by Swift, {{the language of the}} decision implies that Swift had stolen powers reserved to the states, in violation of the Tenth Amendment. Justice Brandeis also noted problems for <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws, but the Equal Protection Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment applies only to states, and the Fifth Amendment's Due Process Clause was not read to include an equal protection component until the 1954 decision in Bolling v. Sharpe.|$|E
25|$|Powers {{given to}} enforce the act were {{initially}} weak, but were supplemented during later years. Congress asserted its authority to legislate under several {{different parts of the}} United States Constitution, principally its power to regulate interstate commerce under Article One (section 8), its duty to guarantee all citizens <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws under the Fourteenth Amendment and its duty to protect voting rights under the Fifteenth Amendment. The Act was signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson on July 2, 1964, at the White House.|$|E

25|$|On July 8, 2010, Tauro issued his rulings in both Gill and Massachusetts, {{granting}} {{summary judgment}} {{for the plaintiffs}} in both cases. He found in Gill that Section 3 of the Defense of Marriage Act violates the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws guaranteed by the Due Process Clause of the Fifth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. In Massachusetts he held that the same section of DOMA violates the Tenth Amendment and falls outside Congress' authority under the Spending Clause of the Constitution. Those decisions were stayed after the DOJ filed an appeal on October 12, 2010.|$|E
25|$|In the Malaysian case Datuk Yong Teck Lee v. Public Prosecutor (1992), the {{plaintiff}} claimed that section27(8) of the Police Act 1967 violated Article8(1) of the Constitution of Malaysia, which provides that all persons are equal {{before the law}} and are entitled to the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> law. It was argued that this provision was violated because parliamentarians who participated in illegal demonstrations were subject to a higher mandatory fine as compared to non-parliamentarians who had committed similar offences. The High Court of Malaya applied the doctrine of reasonable classification and identified a rational relation between the differentia and {{the object of the}} statute.|$|E
25|$|Separate suits {{were brought}} by the American Independent Party and the Socialist Labor Party, {{challenging}} the validity of Ohio election laws insofar as they precluded the parties' being placed on the ballots to choose electors pledged to particular candidates for the Presidency and Vice Presidency of the United States; {{the attack on the}} validity of these laws was rested on the ground that they violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment—on the ground that they denied plaintiffs and the voters who might wish to vote for them the <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws, guaranteed against state abridgment by the Equal Protection Clause of U.S. Const. amend.

25|$|In this case, {{the judge}} {{dismissed}} several potential jurors for various causes. The defense peremptorily challenged nine potential jurors and the prosecutor, Joe Gutmann, peremptorily challenged six, including all four black persons, and a jury composed only of white persons was selected. The defense counsel moved to discharge the whole jury {{on the ground}} that the prosecutor's removal of the black veniremen violated petitioner's rights under the Sixth and Fourteenth Amendments to a jury drawn from a cross section of the community, and under the Fourteenth Amendment to <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws. Without expressly ruling on petitioner's request for a hearing, the trial judge denied the motion, and the jury ultimately convicted the defendant.|$|E
25|$|On March 8, 2004, six {{same-sex}} couples represented by Lambda Legal {{filed suit in}} state court challenging the constitutionality of Washington's Defense of Marriage Act. The four constitutional claims were based on due process, privacy, equal protection, and gender equality. On August 4, King County Superior Court Judge William L. Downing issued an opinion in Andersen v. Sims that said the state had no rational basis for excluding {{same-sex couples}} from the rights and benefits of marriage. The decision concluded that the state law limiting marriage to different-sex couples violated sections of the constitution that required due process and <b>equal</b> <b>protection</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> laws. The court did not require the state to allow same-sex couples to marry, but mandated {{the creation of a}} civil union status that would provide all the rights and benefits of marriage to same-sex couples. Downing stayed enforcement of his order pending appeal to the Washington Supreme Court.|$|E
