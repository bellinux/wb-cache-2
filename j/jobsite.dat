Often a general-purpose blade {{is left in}} place, although blades optimized for wood or metal can be switched out when volume of use warrants. Most residential and commercial bandsaws are of the vertical type mounted on a bench or a cabinet stand.

40|$|The {{presented}} work {{extends the}} state-of-the-art in scientific simulation-driven 3 D construction process visualization.

In addition to automated 3 D terrain generation techniques, ViTerra implements animation methods to describe the evolution of virtual <b>jobsites</b> by depicting deformations to the loaded terrains in response to common construction operations such as earthmoving and trenching. Our first contribution alleviates the need to manually create 3 D terrain models for use in animations as has been the case hitherto.

40|$|Advanced {{construction}} {{technologies have}} been rarely applied to practical construction operations on <b>jobsites</b> {{due to a}} lack of quantified evaluation data of the performance of such technologies. The basic objective of this study is to suggest a feasible way for the evaluation of the performance of new technologies based on construction simulation techniques, which have been frequently used in academic research for productivity estimation. Steel staircase systems were selected as the new technology to be investigated. The simulation was implemented in various ways, such as one staircase to six staircases on a floor. The simulation results provided in this study suggest that planners are able to make a fundamental decision on the use of targeted new technology with the estimated performance data (productivity and unit costs). These findings also indicate that...|$|R
40|$|AbstractConsiderable {{research}} {{work had been}} conducted in recent years embracing the utilization of wireless technologies in construction {{with a focus on}} identification of locations of material, equipment and personnel. A fundamental key for reliable and accurate use of these technologies is path loss models, which are used to estimate distances based on received signal strength (RSSI). This paper introduces a newly developed path loss model accounting for signal de-noising using a Kalman filter. The developed model is tested using four wireless technologies (WLAN, Bluetooth, Zigbee and Synapse SNAP), 20 experiments were carried out in laboratory environment and 1500 data sets were analyzed to investigate the accuracy of distance estimation. The results show an average of 50 % enhancement in the distance estimation accuracy, which considered a potential for enhanced localization on indoor construction <b>jobsites...</b>|$|R

50|$|Agile Construction {{is a way}} {{of doing}} {{business}} adapted to construction <b>jobsites</b> and overall project delivery, born from agile manufacturing and project management, mostly used in manufacturing production, automotive and software developing teams. It is the application of the Toyota Production System to construction, with two parallel paths: measuring (ASTM E2691) and improving productivity, and segregating and externalizing work through prefabrication and supply chain management. Like the Toyota Production System, Agile construction is a system that relies on input from the source of the work information, both up front for planning the project, as well as throughout the life of a project for real-time feedback. The real-time input produces real-time measurements of productivity. It is an iterative and incremental method of managing the design and build activities. This means that each time the process is repeated some changes are made to make the process better. Changes for the better are kept and for the worse are discarded.|$|R
