For 4x4 configuration the rear axle was suspended via air suspension. Full-time all-wheel-drive front twin steer (6x6, 8x8) drive via homo-kinetic drive shafts, drive with the differential locks, inter-axle differentials with locks and planetary <b>hub</b> <b>reductions</b> on all models.

50|$|The trailer axle(s) {{are driven}} by an drive shaft exiting {{the rear of the}} {{transmission}} with splines and universal joints to accommodate the movements between them. All axles are portals with <b>hub</b> <b>reduction</b> and locking differentials. Initially the axle differentials were permanently locked but recently some models can run with open but lockable differentials for better high-speed capabilities. The usual twin back axles are combined in a separate frame that is can pivot in relation to the trailer frame, keeping all wheels on the ground, but until recently always unsprung. Likewise the occasional single back axle usually are unsprung, while the front axle have suspension to give the operator a better ride. The reinforced cab is sometimes also sprung, as is done in modern cab-over-engine trucks, as is the drivers seat.|$|R

The rebuilt locomotive retained the name and number of the Duke. The <b>reduction</b> in <b>axle</b> weight, {{as compared to the}} Bulldogs, allowed for working over the Cambrian section.|$|R
50|$|The {{main gearbox}} was located behind {{the cabin and}} {{connected}} to the engine clutch housing via a short cardan shaft (this design enables a so-called flat floor cabin.) The main gearbox was bolted to an auxiliary gearbox, to a transfer case {{and then to a}} backbone tube and formed main part of a chassis structure. Options for the rear power take off and or a winch drive were available. Main and auxiliary gears were fully synchronized except the first and reverse gear. The new feature was unique 2-speed planetary overdrive system bolted between front and rear axles.The overdrive could only be selected manually whilst stationary. Auxiliary gearbox had a neutral position which allowed a winch and a power take off to use main gearbox gearing for variable speed operation. The final drives used Tatra gear differentials with locks, offset drive shafts and planetary <b>hub</b> <b>reductions.</b>|$|R

Specifically, we find that a process of model homogenization, in which certain components of a mixture model are systematically removed, improves performance as measured against several groundtruth similarity metrics. Extending the work of Aucouturier, we introduce several new methods of homogenization.

50|$|The K-44 {{features}} a driven double <b>reduction</b> front <b>axle</b> incorporating an interlockable differential. The steering knuckles are attached via bevel roller bearings, while the {{front drive shaft}} uses homokinetic joints. The wheel hubs incorporates planetary gears, which permits a higher ground clearance through {{the inclusion of a}} small differential unit. The front suspension uses 3.5 in wide by 1500 mm long leaf springs and telescopic shock absorbers. The wheel size is 8.0-20", and each wheel is held in place with ten nuts.|$|R
50|$|Fitted with {{coil spring}} {{suspension}} and drum brakes, the AML lacks hydraulic assist on either brakes or steering; only front wheels steer. Consequently, {{the steering wheel}} requires considerable strength to turn while the vehicle is in motion - while stationary it remains effectively locked. Much like the Ferret, rear wheel drive is transmitted directly to epicyclic <b>hub</b> <b>reduction</b> gears, also known as bevel boxes. The motor and gearbox have been harnessed via a centrifugal clutch with electromagnetic control, {{eliminating the need for}} a clutch pedal. This type of clutch is automatically engaged by gripping the knob of the gearshift lever, which is located behind the driver's seat in the hull floor. The gearbox assembly consists of two separate gearboxes, one for high and the other for low gear. The low-range gearbox is designed for off-road use and has a reverse gear and a top gear, while the high-range box is for operation on roads and has three low gears and one overdrive. There is a hydraulic dual-circuit handbrake operating on the gearbox output shaft.|$|R

50|$|There {{were also}} totally new trucks {{available}} at the IHC dealers in 1953. One was the Tilto Cab R-195 and R-205 with cab-over-engine design. However, only a few units were ever built by Hendrickson. The R-195 had a 24,000 lbs GVW, used a Red Diamond 406 engine, 14-inch clutch, overdrive or direct drive (in top gear) five-speed transmission, and Eaton single <b>reduction</b> rear <b>axle.</b> The R-205 was similar, but featured the Red Diamond 450 engine, heavier transmission and axles, and larger brakes.

The non-steering axles {{are also available}} as tridem configurations with 39-61.5 tonnes. The capacities of steering, non driven axles are between 8 and 12 tonnes. Some non-driven, non-steering axles with a capacity of 13 tonnes {{are also in the}} selection. The non-steering axles are with S-cam drum brakes, whereas some of the steering axles are equipped with disc or wedge brakes.|$|R

The Endeavour had a heavy duty traction motor, which was attached to a sub-frame by Metalastic flexible mountings. A Layrub shaft delivered power to the double <b>reduction</b> rear <b>axle.</b> Helecs used a controller which was built as a removable unit, so that removing two bolts and some electrical connections allowed the whole panel to be withdrawn from the vehicle. A Layrub shaft was also used on the Tough Ten vehicles.|$|R
50|$|The engines from Beyer, Peacock were war-time {{austerity}} {{models on}} which planished steel boiler lagging {{was replaced by}} ordinary steel lagging, while cosmetic dressing items like stainless steel lagging bands, chrome-plated handrails and rounded corners {{on the front of}} the firebox lagging were absent or replaced by unplated items. While the boiler barrels of the pre-war engines were of nickel steel, the austerity locomotives had boiler barrels made of carbon steel with steel plates of 1/16 in greater thickness. When it was subsequently found that the increased thickness was unnecessary, 13/16 in thick carbon steel plates were used on later orders, the same thickness as earlier used with nickel steel plates, which resulted in a desirable <b>reduction</b> in <b>axle</b> loads.|$|R

40|$|The {{first part}} of this thesis {{addresses}} the design of the NMBU Mobile Agricultural Robot's drivetrain and steering assembly, while the second part discusses aspects related to controlling these systems. Part I: First, power requirements are calculated based on the expected worst case scenario. Second, the principle design of the systems is determined and parts are selected. For the drivetrain, a <b>hub</b> <b>reduction</b> system is used. The system comprises of four separate wheel modules, each with one brushless DC motor installed over the module's wheel. Power is transferred to an in-wheel planetary gearbox via a timing belt. For the steering assembly, brushless integrated servomotors with planetary gearboxes are used. The power distribution system is also discussed, and two designs are proposed, one for future and one for immediate implementation. All parts are selected based on availability, quality and cost. As a result, the components for the drivetrain are not perfectly matched. However, they allow for testing of the basic principle. Preliminary tests of the powertrain and steering assembly show promising results. Part II: Different components related to communication and control of the robot are presented, and the principle design of the motor control system is determined with interoperability between current and future systems in mind. ROS (Robotic Operating System) is selected to be used as the robotic framework, and the main computer and the various motor controllers are to communicate using the CANopen protocol. The process of configuring the propulsion motor controllers to match the propulsion motors is described, as is the process of setting up the servomotors. Problems were faced using the propulsion motors built in Hall sensors for feedback in closed loop speed mode, as the sensor assembly’s resolution proved to be too coarse. Alternative feedback sensors are then proposed. Nordic Association of Agricultural ScientistsM-MP...|$|R

40|$|With {{the volume}} of digital media {{available}} today, automatic music recommendation services have proven {{a useful tool for}} consumers, allowing them to better discover new and enjoyable music. Typically, this technology is based on collaborative filtering techniques, employing human-generated metadata to base recommendations. Recently, work in content-based recommendation systems have emerged in which the audio signal itself is analyzed for relevant musical information from which models are built that attempt to mimic human similarity judgments. 	The current state-of-the-art for content-based music recommendation uses a timbre model based on MFCCs calculated on short segments of tracks. These feature vectors are then modeled using GMMs (Gaussian mixture models). GMM modeling of frame-based MFCCs has been shown to perform fairly well on timbre similarity tasks. However, a common problem is that of hubs, in which a relative small number of songs falsely appear similar to many other songs, significantly decreasing the accuracy of similarity recommendations. 	In this thesis, we explore the origins of hubs in timbre-based modeling and propose several remedies. Specifically, we find that a process of model homogenization, in which certain components of a mixture model are systematically removed, improves performance as measured against several ground-truth similarity metrics. Extending the work of Aucouturier, we introduce several new methods of homogenization. 	On a subset of the uspop data set, model homogenization improves artist R-precision by a maximum of 3. 5 % and agreement to user collection co-occurrence data by 7. 4 %. We also find differences in the effectiveness of the various homogenization methods for <b>hub</b> <b>reduction,</b> with the proposed methods providing the best results.

We find that such an approach significantly reduces the number of hubs (by 2. 6 % of the dataset) while improving agreement to ground-truth by 5 % and slightly improving artist R-precision as compared with the standard parametric model. 	Finally, to test whether these principles hold for all musical data, we introduce an entirely new data set consisting of Indian classical music. We find that our results generalize here as well, suggesting that hubness is a general feature of timbre-based similarity music modeling and that the techniques presented to improve this modeling are effective for diverse types of music.

40|$|A {{nonlinear}} coupled rotor/flexible fuselage {{analysis has}} been developed and used to {{study the effects of}} higher harmonic blade pitch control on the vibratory hub loads and fuselage acceleration levels. Previous results, obtained with this model have shown that conventional higher harmonic control (HHC) inputs aimed at <b>hub</b> shear <b>reduction</b> cause an increase in the fuselage accelerations and vice-versa. It was also found that for simultaneous <b>reduction</b> of <b>hub</b> shears and fuselage accelerations, a pitch input representing a combination of two higher harmonic components of different frequencies was needed. Subsequently, it was found that this input could not be implemented through a conventional swashplate. This paper corrects a mistake originally made in the representation of the multiple frequency pitch input and shows that such a pitch input can be only implemented in the rotating reference frame. A rigorous mathematical solution is found, for the pitch input in the rotating reference frame, which produces simultaneous <b>reduction</b> of <b>hub</b> shears and fuselage acceleration. New insight on vibration reduction in coupled rotor/fuselage systems is obtained from the sensitivity of hub shears to the frequency and amplitude of the open loop HHC signal in the rotating reference frame. Finally the role of fuselage flexibility in this class of problems is determined...|$|R
40|$|In the {{interaction}} between vehicles, pavements and bridges, {{it is essential to}} aim towards a <b>reduction</b> of vehicle <b>axle</b> forces to promote longer pavement life spans and to prevent bridges loads becoming too high. Moreover, as the road surface roughness affects the vehicle dynamic forces, an efficient monitoring of pavement condition is also necessary to achieve this aim. This paper uses a novel algorithm to identify the dynamic interaction forces and pavement roughness from vehicle accelerations in both theoretical simulations and a laboratory experiment; moving force identification theory is applied to a vehicle model for this purpose. Theoretical simulations are employed to evaluate the ability of the algorithm to predict forces over a range of bridge spans and to evaluate the influence of road roughness level on the accuracy of the results. Finally, in addressing the challenge for the real-world problem, the effects of vehicle configuration and speed on the predicted road roughness are also investigated in a laboratory experiment...|$|R
40|$|In {{the current}} work, the {{application}} and advantages of multiple active trailing-edge flaps for helicopter vibration control in forward flight are investigated. Small active flaps {{of this type}} can be actuated using smart materials. A comprehensive aeroelastic analysis is used to model a helicopter with multiple trailing-edge flaps. The objective function containing the hub vibratory loads and flap control effort is minimized by an optimal controller. The control effort is differentially weighted for different flaps, such that all trailing-edge flaps are exploited to their full authority and limited to ± 2 degrees peak deflection. Numerical results are obtained for one, two and three flaps and their optimal locations identified. A reduction of 76 % in the hub vibration level is achieved at an advance ratio (nondimensional forward speed) of 0. 3 using three flaps. For the four-bladed, soft-inplane, hingeless rotor considered in this work, {{it is observed that}} the extent of <b>hub</b> vibration <b>reduction</b> {{is directly related to the}} effect of trailing-edge flap motion on the contribution of the second flapwise bending mode to blade motion. It is also shown that multiple flaps can effectively modify the participation of second flapwise bending mode at a much lower control power than is needed with single and dual flap configurations. Furthermore, multiple flaps are shown to allow redundancy in operation and are considerably more effective than single flaps in low speed transition flight regimes because of their capability in distributing the airloads...|$|R
40|$|The paper {{describes}} a new method for producing stepped rail axles. The method {{is based on}} the skew rolling process. With this method, the product is formed by three tapered rolls located every 120 ° on the perimeter of the billet. Positioned askew to the centerline of the billet, the rolls rotate in the same direction and with the same velocity. At the same time, they get closer together or go apart depending on the desired cross sectional <b>reduction</b> of an <b>axle</b> step. In addition, the workpiece is shifted lengthwise relative to the rolls by the translational motion of the workpiece-holding chuck. In order to verify the designed method for producing rail axles, a series of numerical simulations were performed using the Simufact. Forming v. 12 simulation software. The numerical modeling enabled the determination of maps of the effective strain and temperature in the finished product as well as variations in the loads and torques during rolling. The numerical results unambiguously confirm that the skew rolling method can be applied to form parts of considerable dimensions (the modeled axles had a length of 2146 mm and their maximum diameter was 202 mm) ...|$|R

40|$|The 'hydrid' is {{a fairly}} new serial {{hydraulic}} hybrid drive line concept. The term ‘hydrid’ is used for hydraulic drive lines in which four constant displacement Floating Cup (FC) wheel drive units are pressure controlled by means of two Innas Hydraulic Transformers (IHT). It {{has been shown in}} earlier publications that a four wheel drive hydrid drive line with wheel <b>hub</b> motors realises <b>reductions</b> of fuel consumption and CO 2 emission of more than 50 %. In modern passenger cars, there is a large gap between - on one hand - the engine power and wheel torque necessary to fulfil the maximum performance requirements and - on the other hand - the quite modest power and torque demand in normal, every-day use. This gap is the main reason for the rather bad energy efficiency of modern passenger cars. Contrary to other hybrid concepts, the hydrid can bridge this gap and achieve large reductions without compromising performance. This paper shows how the use of floating cup technology, the pressure amplification capability of the Innas hydraulic transformer (IHT) and a four wheel drive line topology, come together to realise this. After that a serial hydrid front wheel drive line is presented, which can realise similar reductions but uses only one IHT and two FC drive units, which attach to the front axle differential. Finally, some ideas for other serial hydrid drive lines are given...|$|R
