5|$|Few skyscrapers {{were built}} in London before the late 20th century, owing to {{restrictions}} on building heights originally imposed by the London Building Act of 1894, which followed {{the construction of the}} 14-storey Queen Anne's Mansions.

5|$|Some larvae, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the Lycaenidae, form mutual {{associations}} with ants. They {{communicate with the}} ants using vibrations that are transmitted through the substrate as well as using chemical signals. The ants provide some degree of protection to these larvae and they in turn gather honeydew secretions. Large blue (Phengaris arion) caterpillars trick Myrmica ants into taking {{them back to the}} ant colony where they feed on the ant eggs and larvae in a parasitic relationship.|$|E
5|$|Twelve binary halides, {{compounds}} {{with the}} formula VXn (n=2..5), are known. VI4, VCl5, VBr5, and VI5 {{do not exist}} or are extremely unstable. In combination with other reagents, VCl4 {{is used as a}} catalyst for polymerization of dienes. Like all binary halides, those of vanadium are Lewis acidic, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> V(IV) and V(V). Many of the halides form octahedral complexes with the formula VXnL6−n (X = halide; L = other ligand).|$|E
5|$|Aside {{from some}} papers {{published}} discussing myrmecophilous beetles and insect pests in forests, Clark predominately researched and published {{articles about the}} taxonomy of Australian ants. All of his articles and monographs were published in Australia. Throughout his career, Clark described around 200 different species of ants, but half of these may be synonyms. He worked and researched {{with all of the}} main groups of Australian ants, but his research and revisionary efforts were extensive with members of the former subfamily Cerapachyinae (now Dorylinae), <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Phyracaces, the Myrmeciinae, Rhytidoponera and members of the tribe Dolichoderini.|$|E

5|$|Critics of {{the planned}} exhibit, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the American Legion and the Air Force Association, charged that the exhibit focused too much {{attention}} on the Japanese casualties inflicted by the nuclear bomb, {{rather than on the}} motivations for the bombing or the discussion of the bomb's role in ending the conflict with Japan. The exhibit brought to national attention many long-standing academic and political issues related to retrospective views of the bombings. As a result, after various failed attempts to revise the exhibit {{in order to meet the}} satisfaction of competing interest groups, the exhibit was canceled on 30 January 1995. Martin O. Harwit, Director of the National Air and Space Museum, was compelled to resign over the controversy.|$|E
5|$|Hayes attempted, unsuccessfully, {{to fill a}} third vacancy in 1881. Justice Noah Haynes Swayne {{resigned}} {{with the}} expectation that Hayes would fill his seat by appointing Stanley Matthews, who was a friend of both men. Many Senators objected to the appointment, believing that Matthews was too close to corporate and railroad interests, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Jay Gould, and the Senate adjourned without voting on the nomination. The following year, when James A. Garfield entered the White House, he re-submitted Matthews's nomination to the Senate, which this time confirmed Matthews by one vote, 24 to 23. Matthews served for eight years until his death in 1889. His opinion in Yick Wo v. Hopkins in 1886 advanced his and Hayes' views on the protection of ethnic minorities' rights.|$|E
5|$|In {{evolutionary}} terms, {{the split}} between the Caelifera and the Ensifera is no more recent than the Permo-Triassic boundary; the earliest insects that are certainly Caeliferans are in the extinct families Locustopseidae and Locustavidae from the early Triassic, roughly 250 million years ago. The group diversified during the Triassic and have remained important plant-eaters from that time to now. The first modern families such as the Eumastacidae, Tetrigidae and Tridactylidae appeared in the Cretaceous, though some insects that might belong to the last two of these groups {{are found in the}} early Jurassic. Morphological classification is difficult because many taxa have converged towards a common habitat type; recent taxonomists have concentrated on the internal genitalia, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the male. This information is not available from fossil specimens, and the palaentological taxonomy is founded principally on the venation of the hindwings.|$|E

5|$|On 1 September 1950, in {{the middle}} of a holiday in Italy, Pontecorvo {{abruptly}} flew from Rome for Stockholm with his wife and three sons without informing friends or relatives. On 2 September he was helped by Soviet agents to enter the Soviet Union from Finland. His abrupt disappearance caused much concern to many of the western intelligence services, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Britain, Canada and the United States, that were worried about the escape of atomic secrets to the Soviet Union, and of Finland and Sweden, through which Pontecorvo and Marianne had been allowed to travel without valid passports and visas.|$|E
5|$|Other Italian {{folk song}} traditions are less common than ballads and lyric songs. Strophic, {{religious}} laude, sometimes in Latin, are still occasionally performed, and epic songs are also known, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the maggio celebration. Professional female singers perform dirges similar in style to those elsewhere in Europe. Yodeling exists in northern Italy, {{though it is}} most commonly associated with the folk musics of other Alpine nations. The Italian Carnival is associated with several song types, especially the Carnival of Bagolino, Brescia. Choirs and brass bands {{are a part of}} the mid-Lenten holiday, while the begging song tradition extends through many holidays throughout the year.|$|E
5|$|The bobcat {{may have}} {{external}} parasites, mostly ticks and fleas, and often carries the parasites of its prey, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> rabbits and squirrels. Internal parasites (endoparasites) are especially common in bobcats. One study found an average infection rate of 52% from Toxoplasma gondii, but with great regional variation. One mite in particular, Lynxacarus morlani, has to date been found {{only on the}} bobcat. Parasites' and diseases' role in the mortality of the bobcat is still unclear, but they may account for greater mortality than starvation, accidents, and predation.|$|E

5|$|Flag-of-convenience {{registries}} are criticized, {{mostly by}} trade union organizations based in developed countries, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> Europe. On the other hand, maritime industry practitioners and seafarers {{from other countries}} contend {{that this is a}} natural product of globalisation. Seafarers from developed countries must make themselves competitive if they wish to take advantage and practice in a global environment. , thirteen flag states have been found by international shipping organizations to have substandard regulations. A basis for many criticisms is that the flag-of-convenience system allows shipowners to be legally anonymous and difficult to prosecute in civil and criminal actions. Some ships with flags of convenience have been found engaging in crime, offer substandard working conditions, and negatively impact the environment, primarily through illegal, unreported and unregulated fishing. , ships of thirteen flags of convenience are targeted for special enforcement by countries that they visit. Supporters of the practice, however, point to economic and regulatory advantages, and increased freedom in choosing employees from an international labor pool.|$|E
5|$|Henry Conwell (c. 1748 – April 22, 1842) was an Irish-born Catholic {{bishop in}} the United States. He became {{a priest in}} 1776 and served in that {{capacity}} in Ireland {{for more than four}} decades. After the Pope declined to appoint him Archbishop of Armagh, the diocese in which he served as Vicar General, he was instead installed as the second Bishop of Philadelphia in 1819. Conwell took up the post at an advanced age, and spent much of his time there feuding with the lay trustees of his parishes, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> St. Mary's Church in Philadelphia. When Conwell removed and excommunicated William Hogan, a controversial priest at St. Mary's, the parish trustees instead rejected Conwell's authority, creating a minor schism. The two sides partially reconciled by 1826, but the Vatican hierarchy believed Conwell had ceded too much power to the laymen in the process, and recalled him to Rome. Although he retained his position, Conwell was compelled to relinquish actual control to his coadjutor bishop, Francis Kenrick. He remained in Philadelphia and performed some priestly duties, but for all practical purposes no longer ran the diocese. He died there in 1842 at the age of about 94.|$|E

5|$|Major air shows held {{regularly}} {{include the}} Duxford Air Show, the Flying Legends show (organised by The Fighter Collection), and American Air Day, which {{is held in}} conjunction with units of the Third Air Force (part of the United States Air Forces in Europe), based at nearby RAF Lakenheath and RAF Mildenhall. The Duxford Air Show usually exhibits {{a wide range of}} aircraft, from vintage warbirds to contemporary jet aircraft, along with aerobatic flying by groups such as the Red Arrows. while the Flying Legends show focuses on historic aircraft, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the Second World War. In 2008 it was reported that these displays generate up to £1.8 million, while the loss of up to £100,000 due to adverse weather is also budgeted for. The policing bill, necessary to manage the resulting road traffic, was reported as some £8,000. Recent major events have included the Battle of Britain 70th Anniversary airshow, held on 4–5 September 2010. The show was attended by more than 40,000 people, and featured formation displays by four Hawker Hurricanes and sixteen Spitfires.|$|E
5|$|Stelmach's premiership {{was heavily}} focused on {{management}} of the province's oil reserves, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> the Athabasca Oil Sands. He rejected calls from environmentalists to slow the pace of development in the Fort McMurray area, and similarly opposed calls for carbon taxes. Other policy initiatives included commencing {{an overhaul of the}} province's health governance system, amendments to the Alberta human rights code, a re-introduction of all-party committees to the Legislature, and the conclusion of a major labour agreement with Alberta's teachers. His government also attracted controversy for awarding itself a 30% pay increase shortly after its re-election, and featured strained relations with Calgary, one of Klein's former strongholds. Despite this, Stelmach increased the Progressive Conservatives' already substantial majority in the 2008 election. With the advent of the late-2000s recession, Stelmach had to cope with a deteriorating economic situation and the Alberta government's first budget deficit in 16 years.|$|E
5|$|The Imperial War Museum {{originated}} {{during the}} First World War in 1917 as the National War Museum committee, {{formed by the}} British government to record the war effort and sacrifice of Britain and her Empire. The museum opened in 1920, by which point it had been renamed the Imperial War Museum. With {{the outbreak of the}} Second World War, the museum's terms of reference were enlarged to include the conflict. The museum's terms of reference was broadened again in 1953 to include all modern conflicts in which British or Commonwealth forces were engaged. The effect of these expansions of remit was to cause the museum's collections to expand enormously, to the point that many parts of the collection, <b>especially</b> <b>those</b> <b>of</b> aircraft, vehicles and artillery, could not be effectively stored or exhibited. Although the museum's south London home (a nineteenth-century building in Southwark which was previously the Bethlem Royal Hospital) had been extended in 1966, {{by the end of the}} decade the museum was seeking additional space.|$|E
