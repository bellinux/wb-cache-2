40|$|This work {{advances}} {{the concept}} of deep borehole disposal (DBD), where spent nuclear fuel (SNF) is isolated at depths of several km in basement rock. Improvements to the engineered components of the DBD concept (e. g., plug, canister, and fill materials) are presented. Reference site parameters and models for radionuclide transport, dose, and cost are developed and coupled to optimize DBD design. A conservative and analytical representation of thermal expansion flow gives vertical velocities of fluids vs. time (and the results are compared against numerical models). When fluid breakthrough occurs rapidly, the chemical transport model is necessary to calculate radionuclide concentrations along the flow path to the surface. The model derived here incorporates conservative assumptions, including instantaneous dissolution of the SNF, high solubility, low sorption, no aquifer or isotopic dilution, and a host rock matrix that is saturated (at a steady state profile) for each radionuclide. For radionuclides that do not decay rapidly, sorb, or reach solubility limitations (e. g., 1 - 129), molecular diffusion in the host rock (transverse to the flow path) is the primary loss mechanism. The first design basis failure mode (DB 1) assumes the primary flow path is a 1. 2 m diameter region with 100 x higher permeability than the surrounding rock, while DB 2 assumes a 0. 1 mm diameter fracture. For the limiting design basis (DB 1), borehole repository design is constrained (via dose limits) by the areal loading of SNF (MTHM/km 2), which increases linearly with disposal depth. In the final portion of the thesis, total costs (including drilling, site characterization, and emplacement) are minimized ($/kgHM) while borehole depth, <b>disposal</b> <b>zone</b> length, and borehole spacing are varied subject to the performance (maximum dose) constraint. Accounting for a large uncertainty in costs, the optimal design generally lies at the minimum specified disposal depth (assumed to be 1200 in), with <b>disposal</b> <b>zone</b> length of 800 - 1500 m and borehole spacing of 250 - 360 meters. Optimized costs range between $ 45 to $ 191 /kgHM, largely depending on the assumed emplacement method and drilling cost.

30|$|The hydrogeochemical {{assessment}} {{results and}} distribution of groundwater major cations (Na+, Ca 2 +, K+, Mg 2 +) and anions (HCO 3 −, Cl−, SO 42 −, F−) {{in the study area}} indicate that groundwater chemistry is mainly influenced by aquifer lithology than anthropogenic activities. Groundwater in the study area is dominated by sodium and bicarbonate ions which define the general composition of the water type to be Na–K–HCO 3. With exception of fluoride, the quality of groundwater is generally suitable for drinking purpose and other socioeconomic uses. Based on the hydrogeological investigation, two potential aquifers (volcanic sediment and weathered/fractured formation) have been identified both having substantial yield. Generally, the aquifers yield water containing significant concentration of fluoride exceeding WHO guidelines. Fluoride concentrations were higher than WHO guidelines (1.5  mg/l) and Tanzanian standards (4.0  mg/l) by 82 and 36 % of the analyzed groundwater samples, respectively. The northern and northwestern parts of the study area indicated high fluoride concentrations in both well and spring waters than southern zone. As mentioned earlier, high fluoride concentration in northern and northwestern parts is probably due to dominance in basaltic formation and other fluoride-rich volcanic materials such as lahars and volcanic ash which are known to contain and release significant amount of fluoride into groundwater in the region. However, a detailed geological studies need to be conducted to precisely inform the entire spectrum of fluoride distribution in the study area. Groundwater abstracted from {{the southern part of the}} study area is of better quality for human consumption than northern zones which is at high elevation on the foot of Mt. Meru. The influence of anthropogenic pollutants was observed in shallow wells and spring sources. This was evidenced by relatively high concentrations of nitrate, chloride and sulfate in samples collected from sources close to populated urban areas, wastewater effluent <b>disposal</b> <b>zones,</b> and croplands. Spring water sources should be protected from anthropogenic activities as they produce water of good quality in terms of key chemical parameters including fluoride which seems to be critical in the study area.|$|R
40|$|This report reviews marine zoning in the Monterey Bay National Marine Sanctuary (MBNMS). The 72 zoned {{areas in}} the MBNMS are of 13 {{different}} zone types. Each marine zone type has associated regulations that restrict or promote specific activities. For example, recreational activities such as boating, fishing, tidepooling, snorkeling, and SCUBA diving are limited in some zones. Scientific research is allowed at all sites, with appropriate permits, and is specifically promoted in a few sites. In addition, motorized personal watercraft use, dredge material disposal, large vessel traffic, jade collection, and aircraft overflight are allowed only in specific zones. The effectiveness of the marine zoning in the MBNMS {{is difficult to determine}} for two reasons. Firstly, many of the zones lack a clearly stated purpose or have confusing regulations. Secondly, the majority of the zones have not been evaluated formally by the managing agencies. Of the zones that have been evaluated, such as Dredge Material <b>Disposal</b> <b>zones,</b> Big Creek MRPA Ecological Reserve, and Pt. Lobos State/Ecological Reserve, the majority appear to be achieving their mandated purpose to some extent. Many of the zones in the MBNMS fall under the title "marine reserve. " Marine reserves have recently received significant attention internationally, nationally, and in California due to their potential for: improving the status of exploited species; protecting marine habitats and ecosystems from degradation; facilitating scientific research and fisheries management; and increasing ecotourism. However, reserves must be well designed and managed to reach this potential. A well designed and managed reserve will have clearly defined goals, scientifically-based design, proper enforcement of regulations, rigorous evaluation of the reserve's effectiveness, and adaptive management. Based on these criteria, the majority of the marine reserves in California are not well designed or managed.

The present study used a questionnaire and a weighing operation to investigate the perceived quality of HWM and the quantity of biomedical waste in Valiasr hospital, Nurabad district, Mamasani county, Iran, from July to September 2013. For 21 days, {{at the end of}} each shift, all hospital waste was weighed using scales. In addition, a 21 -item questionnaire concerning perceptions of the quality of waste division, collection, storage, and transportation was administered to 40 hospital employees. The results of the weighing operation revealed that the hospital generated 417. 99 kg of waste per bed per day (kg/bed-day). Considering that there are 96 beds actively used in the hospital, the average kg/bed-day of waste generated was 2. 32 kg/bed-day of infectious waste, 0. 03 kg/bed-day of sharps, and 2 kg/bed-day of household waste. The highest amount of infectious waste was generated in the emergency unit and the second highest in the operating rooms.

40|$|The Department of Energy must {{demonstrate}} {{the effectiveness of}} the Waste Isolation Pilot Plant (WIPP) as a permanent repository for the disposal of transuranic (TRU) waste. Performance assessments of the WIPP require that estimates of the transportability and outcome of the radionuclides (actinides) be determined from disposal rooms that may become either partially or completely filled with brine. Federal regulations limit the amount of radioactivity that may be unintentionally released to the accessible environment by any mechanism during the post closure phase up to 10, 000 years. Thermodynamic models have been developed to predict the concentrations of actinides in the WIPP disposal rooms under various situations and chemical conditions. These models are based on empirical and theoretical projections of the chemistry that might be present in and around the <b>disposal</b> room <b>zone</b> for both near and long-term periods. The actinides that are known to be present in the TRU wastes (and are included in the model) are Th, U, Np, Pu, and Am. Knowledge of the chemistry that might occur in the disposal rooms when the waste comes in contact with brine is important in understanding the range of oxidation states that might be present under different conditions. There is a need to establish the mechanisms and resultant rate of transport, migration, or effective retardation of actinides beyond the disposal rooms to the boundary of the accessible environment. The influence of the bulk salt rock, clay sediments and other geologic matrices on the transport behavior of actinides must be determined to establish the overall performance and capability of the WIPP in isolating waste from the environment.

40|$|Due to {{the nature}} of the {{regional}} geology and the bitumen extraction process, the post-mined landscape of Canada’s oil sands region will have a much higher concentration of dissolved salts than it did prior to mining. As a result, naturally saline wetlands may constitute appropriate reclamation targets and knowledge of saline wetland hydrology can provide important clues to their form and function. Furthermore, the presence of saline discharge features in the Athabasca oil sands region (AOSR) provides an opportunity to study more closely the nature of groundwater flow in a region of considerable hydrogeologic complexity, including the origin and flow history of brines and the link between springs, subsurface wastewater containment and surface water quality. A low-flow saline-spring fen peatland located adjacent to a proposed in-situ oil extraction facility was examined south of the oil sands hub of Fort McMurray, Alberta. Hydrologically disconnected from underlying Devonian deposits that are a typical source of salinity, a saline groundwater plume originating from a Lower Cretaceous aquifer (the Grand Rapids Formation) was identified as a likely source for the accumulation of Na+ (mean of 6, 949 mg L- 1) and Cl- (mean of 13, 766 mg L- 1) in fen groundwater. Considerable spatial variability in ground and surface water salinity was observed, with the concentration of dissolved salts decreasing by an order of magnitude in the direction of flow. A sharp decrease in near-surface salinity was found along the entire perimeter between the fen and adjacent freshwater wetlands. Patterns in deep groundwater flux were difficult to interpret due to possible inaccuracies associated with the piezometer network (e. g., time-lag errors in low hydraulic conductivity substrates), and rates of groundwater input were estimated to be small (< 1 mm over a season) due to the low conductivity of the underlying mineral till (5. 5 x 10 - 7 cm s- 1). Water table dynamics were exaggerated in response to wetting and drying for both study seasons and the fen’s small subsurface storage capacity was readily exceeded under periods of sustained rainfall. The large pond network functioned as an effective transmitter of surface water during periods of high water table but was a sink of groundwater during dry periods due to high rates of evaporation. Despite flooding conditions observed in 2012, groundwater exchange between the fen and adjacent wetlands was low and the rough microtopography worked to detain surface waters and restrict runoff in the fen’s lower reaches. Together these mechanisms worked to isolate the saline fen and restrict the flux of saline waters into the surrounding landscape. Elevated concentrations of dissolved salts in nearby wetland and river systems indicates that influence of saline discharge is not solely restricted to the region’s major river systems. The flux of salt from saline wetlands may play an important role in the overall water quality of groundwater and receiving water bodies (e. g., nearby river systems). The geochemical signature of fen groundwater points to halite as a source of salinity, as indicated by Cl-/Br- ratios in excess of 7, 000. This is in contrast to what has been observed for regional formation brines that are typically related to evaporated seawater. Isotopic evidence and relatively low salinities compared to springs in the Wood Buffalo region suggests that fen discharge water may be significantly diluted as a result of mixing with freshwater sources. The contribution of evaporite to discharge water may be coming from somewhere deeper and further south in the basin. This has important implications for the disposal of wastewater by deep well injection, as <b>disposal</b> <b>zones</b> may be hydrologically linked to near-surface aquifers and discharge features well beyond the immediate production and storage area...|$|R
40|$|Artificial {{recharge}} for {{the purpose}} of replenishing the fresh ground-water body in Hawaii has been deliberately practiced in a few areas for many years, and has been recognized as incidental to other practices, principally irrigation, in many areas for several decades. The effects of these various artificial recharge practices on Hawaii Ghyben-Herzberg aquifers are briefly described in this report. In recent years, the practice of artificially recharging wastewater such as storm runoff, sewage effluent, and various industrial wastes into the subsurface has become of growing importance in Hawaii. In 1970 the Kahului Development Company began construction of a collecting basin and four deep injection wells for the disposal of storm runoff from a residential development in Kahului, Maui. This presented a unique opportunity to evaluate the suitability of the site for artificial recharge and to study the possible effects recharge of storm runoff might have on the local ground-water body, both from a water quality and a hydraulic standpoint. Studies were made to determine the following information: (i) the concentrations of selected chemical and biological parameters in storm runoff from residential areas in the town of Kahului and in the ground-water body {{in the area of the}} collecting basin and injection wells {{for the purpose}} of predicting the effects of artificial recharge of storm runoff on the water quality of the existing local ground-water body, (ii) the injection rates that can be expected for the completed injection wells by means of pumping and injection tests, and (iii) the movement of the injected water by monitoring water levels and selected chemical and biological parameters at observation wells near the injection site. The results of pumping and injection tests of one completed well and one test hole indicate that the finished injection wells should be able to inject at rates in excess of 5500 gallons per minute per well if significant clogging from sediment does not occur, and if hydraulic interference between the four wells operating simultaneously is not significant. Water analyses indicate that quality of the storm runoff from the Kahului area is generally good, with low dissolved solids and low chloride concentrations. Some fecal coliform will undoubtedly be introduced into the aquifer during injection of storm runoff. However, dilution of the injected runoff by the ground water and the hostile environment presented by the saline water in the <b>disposal</b> <b>zone</b> should eliminate any bacterial hazard. The most serious potential water quality problem may be a reduction in injection efficiency owing to possible well clogging by heavy sediment loads. The general water quality effects of injecting storm runoff into the ground-water body will be to decrease the dissolved solids concentration of the ground water in the vicinity of the wells.

Oil sludge biodegradation was monitored by CO 2 evolution and by periodic analysis of residual hydrocarbons. The parameters studied were soil moisture, pH, mineral nutrients, micronutrients, organic supplements, treatment rate, teratment frequency, and incubation temperature. Oil sludge biodegradation was optimal at a soil water-holding capacity of 30 to 90 %, a pH of 7. 5 to 7. 8, C:N and C:P ratios of 60 : 1 and 800 : 1, respectively, and a temperature of 20 degrees C or above. Addition of micronutrients and organic supplements was not beneficial; sewage sludge interfered with hydrocarbon biodegradation. Breakdown of the saturated hydrocarbon (alkane and cycloalkane) fraction was the highest at low application rates, but higher application rates favored the biodegradation of the aromatic and asphaltic fractions. An application rate of 5 % (wt/wt) oil sludge hydrocarbon to the soil (100, 000 liters/hectare) achieved a good compromise between high biodegradation rates and efficient land use and resulted in the best overall biodegradation rate of all hydrocarbon classes. Frequent small applications resulted in higher biodegradation than single large applications.

40|$|This Special Analysis (SA) was {{initiated}} {{to address a}} concern expressed by the Department of Energy's Low Level Waste Disposal Facility Federal Review Group (LFRG) Review Team during their review of the 2008 E-Area Performance Assessment (PA) (WSRC, 2008). Their concern was the potential for overlapping of atmospheric plumes, emanating from the soil surface above SRS LLW disposal facilities within the E-Area, {{to contribute to the}} dose received {{by a member of the}} public during the Institutional Control (IC) period. The implication of this concern was that the dose to the maximally-exposed individual (MEI) located at the SRS boundary might be underestimated during this time interval. To address this concern a re-analysis of the atmospheric pathway releases from E-Area was required. In the process of developing a new atmospheric release model (ARM) capable of addressing the LFRG plume overlap concern, it became obvious that new and better atmospheric pathway disposal limits should be developed for each of the E-Area disposal facilities using the new ARM. The scope of the SA was therefore expanded to include the generation of these new limits. The initial work conducted in this SA was to develop a new ARM using the GoldSim{reg_sign} program (GTG, 2009). The model simulates the subsurface vapor diffusion of volatile radionuclides as they release from E-Area <b>disposal</b> facility waste <b>zones</b> and migrate to the land surface. In the process of this work, many new features, including several new physical and chemical transport mechanisms, were incorporated into the model. One of the most important improvements was to incorporate a mechanism to partition volatile contaminants across the water-air interface within the partially saturated pore space of the engineered and natural materials through which vapor phase transport occurs. A second mechanism that was equally important was to incorporate a maximum concentration of 1. 9 E- 07 Ci/m{sup 3 } of {sup 14 }CO{sub 2 } in the air-filled pores of cementitious materials. The ARM also combines the individual transport models constructed for each E-Area disposal facility into a single model, and was ultimately used to analyze the LFRG concern regarding the potential for atmospheric plume overlap at the SRS boundary during the IC period. To evaluate the plume overlap issue, a conservative approach was adopted whereby the MEI at the SRS boundary was exposed to the releases from all E-Area disposal facilities simultaneously. This is equivalent to a 100 % overlap of all atmospheric plumes emanating from E-Area. Should the dose received from this level of atmospheric plume overlap still fall below the permissible exposure level of 10 mrem/yr, then the LFRG concern would be alleviated. The structuring of the ARM enables this evaluation to be easily performed. During the IC period, the peak of the 'total plume overlap dose' was computed to be 1. 9 E- 05 mrem/yr, which is five orders of magnitude lower than the 10 mrem/yr PA performance objective for the atmospheric release pathway. The main conclusion of this study is that for atmospheric releases from the E-Area disposal facilities, plume overlap does not cause the total dose to the MEI at the SRS boundary during the IC to exceed the Performance Assessment (PA) performance objective. Additionally, the potential for plume overlap was assessed in the post-Institutional Control period. Atmospheric plume overlap is less likely to occur during this period but conceivably could occur if the prevailing wind direction shifted so as to pass directly over all EArea disposal facilities and transport airborne radionuclides to the MEI at the 100 m point of compliance (POC). This concern was also demonstrated of little concern, as the maximum plume overlap dose was found to be 1. 45 E+ 00 mrem/yr (or {approx} 15 % of the performance measure) during this period and under these unlikely conditions...|$|R
