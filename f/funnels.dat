5|$|The Helgoland {{class was}} {{the second type of}} German dreadnoughts, built during 1908–1912. The class was {{composed}} of four ships: Helgoland, Oldenburg, Ostfriesland, and Thüringen. The ships incorporated significant improvements over the previous Nassau type, including more powerful main guns and an improved propulsion system. The Helgolands were easily distinguished from the preceding Nassaus by the three <b>funnels</b> that were closely arranged, compared to the two larger <b>funnels</b> of the previous class. The ships retained the unusual hexagonal main battery layout of the Nassau class.|$|E

5|$|Dreadnoughts tripod {{foremast}} {{was positioned}} behind the forward funnel {{to allow the}} vertical leg {{to serve as a}} support for the boat-handling derrick. This meant that the hot funnel gases could render the spotting top uninhabitable in conditions of little or no wind. The Bellerophons had the foremast moved forward of the <b>funnels</b> to reduce the problem in the spotting top and a second tripod mast was added to handle the derrick, but it had to be positioned in front of the aft funnel to do that, which rendered the aft spotting top almost useless as it could be exposed to the exhaust plumes from both <b>funnels</b> under certain circumstances.|$|E
5|$|During Florida and Utahs {{reconstruction}} in 1925–1927, their coal-fired boilers {{were replaced}} with four White-Forster oil-fired boilers. The {{reduction in the}} number of boilers allowed their twin <b>funnels</b> to be trunked into one single larger funnel.|$|E
5|$|In Akagi predecessor, Hōshō, the hot {{exhaust gases}} vented by {{swivelling}} <b>funnels</b> posed {{a danger to}} the ship, and wind-tunnel testing had not suggested any solutions. Akagi and Kaga were given different solutions to evaluate in real-world conditions. Akagi was given two <b>funnels</b> on the starboard side. The larger, forward funnel was angled 30° below horizontal with its mouth facing the sea, and the smaller one exhausted vertically a little past the edge of the flight deck. The forward funnel was fitted with a water-cooling system to reduce the turbulence caused by hot exhaust gases and a cover that could be raised to allow the exhaust gases to escape if the ship developed a severe list and the mouth of the funnel touched the sea. Kaga adopted a version of this configuration when she was modernized during the mid-1930s.|$|E

40|$|Thesis (M. S.) University of Alaska Fairbanks, 2016 There are no {{forecasting}} {{systems for}} <b>funnel</b> clouds for Alaska. The inability of forecasting is problematic because <b>funnel</b> clouds {{pose a threat}} to aviation, which serves as Alaska’s main form of transportation. Motivated by the lack of research on the formation of <b>funnel</b> clouds in Alaska, this research investigated characteristics of <b>funnel</b> clouds and atmospheric conditions under which <b>funnel</b> clouds form using operational Doppler weather radars and radiosonde soundings as well as synoptic weather maps. In Alaska, <b>funnel</b> clouds usually occur during the summer months May to September with a maximum of occurrence in July and around 1500 Alaska Daylight Time as shown in the <b>funnel</b> cloud observational data. The observed <b>funnel</b> clouds are usually not associated with severe thunderstorms and do not occur with strong synoptic scale forcing. As such, it was hypothesized that local effects from sea breeze fronts and orographic circulations might be the main forcing. Operational soundings indicate that some, but not all <b>funnel</b> cloud events occurred under large Convective Available Potential Energy (greater than 500 J) and strong lowlevel wind shear. <b>Funnel</b> clouds were difficult to identify in routine operational Doppler weather radars because the <b>funnel</b> clouds display small cross-sectional area compared to the radar resolution. An algorithm to retrieve similar vertical profiles from the entire radiosonde data than those observed during documented <b>funnel</b> cloud events was developed. By using similarity between radiosonde profiles of days of the observed <b>funnel</b> clouds and the similar radiosonde profiles scanned over the years, an idea of <b>funnel</b> cloud or severe storm occurrence can be ascertained. The mechanisms for <b>funnel</b> cloud formation differ by region. In Interior Alaska, the Alaska Range’s katabatic slope winds and the Tanana Valley wind create the needed vorticity. Along the west coast of Alaska, air-sea interaction plays a role. In Cook Inlet, topography and land-sea play a role. All <b>funnel</b> cloud events have weak synoptic scale forcing...|$|R
5|$|Tornadoes {{can have}} {{a wide range of}} colors, {{depending}} on the environment in which they form. Those that form in dry environments can be nearly invisible, marked only by swirling debris {{at the base of the}} funnel. Condensation <b>funnels</b> that pick up little or no debris can be gray to white. While traveling over a body of water (as a waterspout), tornadoes can turn white or even blue. Slow-moving <b>funnels,</b> which ingest a considerable amount of debris and dirt, are usually darker, taking on the color of debris. Tornadoes in the Great Plains can turn red because of the reddish tint of the soil, and tornadoes in mountainous areas can travel over snow-covered ground, turning white.|$|E
5|$|Dante Alighieri was {{designed}} by Rear Admiral Engineer Edoardo Masdea, Chief Constructor of the Regia Marina, based on the ideas of General Vittorio Cuniberti who advocated a battleship with main guns of a single caliber and optimized for broadside fire. In addition, the ship's superstructure and <b>funnels</b> were to be kept to a minimum.|$|E
5|$|Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino (STT) of Trieste was {{selected}} for the contract to build eight vessels, ahead of one other tenderer. Despite the specifications of the contract being {{very close to the}} requirements for the coastal torpedo boat, the STT boats were classified as sea-going. The STT boats used Parsons turbines driving two propeller shafts. Another tender was requested for four more boats, but when Ganz & Danubius reduced their price by ten percent, a total of sixteen boats were ordered from them. These boats were powered by AEG-Curtiss turbines, and had two <b>funnels</b> rather than the single funnel of the STT boats. The third contract went to Cantiere Navale Triestino (CNT), who used Melms-Pfenniger turbines, and their boats also had two <b>funnels.</b> The boats of all three groups used steam generated by two Yarrow water-tube boilers, one of which burned fuel oil and the other coal.|$|E
5|$|Tornadoes often {{begin as}} <b>funnel</b> clouds with no {{associated}} strong winds at the surface, {{and not all}} <b>funnel</b> clouds evolve into tornadoes. Most tornadoes produce strong winds at the surface while the visible <b>funnel</b> is still above the ground, so {{it is difficult to}} discern the difference between a <b>funnel</b> cloud and a tornado from a distance.|$|R
50|$|For more emphasis, {{it makes}} sense why a <b>funnel</b> in {{analytics}} is called a <b>funnel.</b> An actual <b>funnel,</b> like the ones from a kitchen or garage, gets narrower along its length, allowing less volume to pass through it.

5|$|Sydney {{was fitted}} with a , cordite-powered {{revolving}} catapult between the two <b>funnels,</b> which was used to launch a Supermarine Walrus (sometimes described as a Seagull V) amphibious aircraft. The Walrus was operated by Royal Australian Air Force personnel from No. 5 Squadron RAAF (which was redesignated No. 9 Squadron RAAF in 1939). The 7-ton electric crane used to recover the aircraft also served to deploy most of the ship's boats.|$|E
5|$|The American Bird Conservancy {{designated}} Whitefish Point a Globally Important Bird Area. Whitefish Point's {{land and}} water features create a natural corridor that <b>funnels</b> thousands of birds during spring and fall migrations, providing unique opportunities for research, education, and conservation programs. Golden eagles, peregrine falcons, merlins, boreal owls, great gray owls, red-throated loons, red-necked grebes, scoters, and jaegers (also known as skuas) {{are just some of}} the birds that can be seen during migration.|$|E
5|$|The ship mounted four 45-calibre 4.7-inch Mark IX guns {{in single}} mounts. For {{anti-aircraft}} (AA) defence, Delight {{had a single}} 12-pounder (3-inch (76.2mm)) gun between her <b>funnels</b> and two quadruple Mark I mounts for the 0.5-inch Vickers Mark III machine gun. She was fitted with two above-water quadruple torpedo tube mounts for 21-inch torpedoes. One depth charge rail and two throwers were fitted; 20 depth charges were originally carried, but this increased to 35 shortly after the war began.|$|E
50|$|There is some {{disagreement}} over {{the definition of}} <b>funnel</b> cloud and condensation <b>funnel.</b> According to the Glossary of Meteorology, a <b>funnel</b> cloud is any rotating cloud pendant from a cumulus or cumulonimbus, and thus most tornadoes are included under this definition. Among many meteorologists, the <b>funnel</b> cloud term is strictly defined as a rotating cloud which is not associated with strong winds at the surface, and condensation <b>funnel</b> is a broad term for any rotating cloud below a cumuliform cloud.|$|R

5|$|The {{ship was}} fitted with three rudders, and the armored {{pilothouse}} was mounted {{on top of}} the gun turret.

5|$|The {{two main}} {{parts of the}} wreck of Titanic present a {{striking}} contrast. Although fourteen survivors testified that the ship had broken apart as she sank, this testimony was discounted by the official inquiries, and it was supposed that the ship had sunk intact.

5|$|They were {{intended}} to carry a number of boats aboard, including two picket boats, two barges, two launches, two pinnaces, two yawls, and two dinghies. The ships were also to be equipped with a double catapult mounted between the two <b>funnels,</b> and four Arado Ar 196 seaplanes for maritime reconnaissance. The aircraft were stored in a main hangar just aft of the forward funnel, along with two smaller hangars, {{one on each side}} of the rear funnel.|$|E
50|$|If a <b>funnel</b> cloud {{touches the}} ground {{it becomes a}} tornado. Most tornadoes begin as <b>funnel</b> clouds, but many <b>funnel</b> clouds do not make ground contact and so do not become tornadoes. Also, a tornado does not {{necessarily}} {{need to have an}} associated condensation <b>funnel</b> - if strong cyclonic winds are occurring at the surface (and connected to a cloud base, regardless of condensation), then the feature is a tornado. Some tornadoes may appear only as a debris swirl, with no obvious <b>funnel</b> cloud extending below the rotating cloud base.|$|R
40|$|The {{temperature}} in pit and <b>funnel</b> traps with various shade-cover treatments {{on the two}} hottest days in Perth {{in the summer of}} 2008 / 09 were examined. Lethal temperatures for small mammals and reptiles were experienced in pipe and bucket pit-traps and <b>funnel</b> traps without covers on both days. <b>Funnel</b> traps with shade covers provided similar or better protection from solar radiation than buckets, pipes and <b>funnel</b> traps without covers. A breeze reduced temperatures in <b>funnel</b> traps more than it did in bucket and pipe pit-traps. It is recommended that all <b>funnel</b> traps deployed during fauna surveys be protected by a shade cover and during hot conditions a second shade cover should be used...|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} ion <b>funnel</b> is described. Counterintuitively, increased spacing between electrodes {{results in}} enhanced “focusing” of the ions through the <b>funnel.</b> Consequently, the internal diameter (i. d.) of the <b>funnel</b> need not decrease to the conductance limit (as in previous designs). A simple dc-only lens, which {{also serves as}} the conductance limit, combined with the natural flow of gas is used to extract the ions from the <b>funnel.</b> Ions with mass to charge ratios varying between 75 and 3000 m/z are passed through the <b>funnel</b> with no apparent discrimination. The <b>funnel</b> can be operated under mild conditions that preserve weakly bound noncovalent complexes. After testing several designs, a thin closely spaced dc lens {{was found to be}} the best solution for extracting ions. A simple method for simulating ion trajectories at nonzero pressures based on ion mobility and explicit diffusion is described. This theoretical approach was used to design and calculate ion trajectories for the modified <b>funnel</b> presented here. Finally, the increased spacing between electrodes in the current <b>funnel</b> significantly relaxes machining constraints, reduces cost, and enhances ease of use versus previous <b>funnel</b> designs...|$|R
5|$|Yorks {{design was}} based on the earlier County classes but was {{intended}} to be smaller and cheaper, although better armoured. She was easily distinguishable from her sister ship, , as the latter had straight masts and <b>funnels,</b> while those of York were angled to the rear.

5|$|Built {{at a cost}} {{of about}} £300,000, Tubantia was, {{according}} to author Nigel Pickford, one of the most luxurious passenger ships of the era. Royal Holland Lloyd made extensive use of electricity throughout Tubantia, powering everything from fans and ventilation, to laundry equipment, to cigar lighters for passengers. The ship also boasted her name spelled out in lights, suspended between the two <b>funnels.</b> Tubantia could accommodate up to 1,520 passengers: 250 first-class, 230 intermediate-class, 140 special third-class, and 900 third-class passengers. The liner was launched on 13 November 1913, and completed trials in the River Clyde in March 1914.|$|E
