40|$|In {{this thesis}} I aim to {{critically}} {{examine how the}} European Union (EU) liberal economic discourse towards Cuba is (re) produced and how the discourse <b>enables</b> <b>policy</b> actions. Furthermore, I aim {{to go beyond the}} question of how the liberal economic discourse <b>enables</b> <b>policy</b> actions. I will do so by asking how alternative policy actions are disabled through the discourse. This critical understanding of the (re) production of liberal economic discourse, <b>enabling</b> and disabling <b>policies,</b> aims to make it possible to question the dominant liberal economic development thinking. The research uses discourse analysis within a post structural approach, wishing to contribute to critical insights in the field of foreign policy discourse analysis. The analysis of the construction of the Self and the Other, through spatial, temporal and ethical dimensions, aims to shed light on the underlying taken for granted notions embedded in EU discourse. These taken for granted notions are understood to <b>enable</b> and limit <b>policy</b> actions. The goal of the thesis is to destabilize dominant liberal economic discourse and to open up room for plurality...|$|R

50|$|One {{feature of}} UTM {{appliances}} {{is that they}} provide security technology that can handle the increasingly regulatory environment across the world.Regulatory compliances like HIPAA, GLBA, PCI-DSS, FISMA, CIPA, SOX, NERC, FFIEC require access controls and auditing that control data leakage. UTMs that provide identity-based security and give visibility into user activity while <b>enabling</b> <b>policy</b> creation based on the user identity, meeting the requirements of regulatory compliance. Identity-based UTMs deliver identity-based reports on individual users in the network. This offers short audit and reporting cycles and facilitates the meeting of regulatory compliance requirements in enterprises.|$|E

5000|$|The {{first is}} {{terminology}} confusion: {{the variety of}} definitions creates the potential for not only confusion, but also resistance to engage with an approach that has emerged, often somewhat independently, from different fields. As stated by Scherr et al.: “People {{are talking about the}} same thing without realizing it. This can lead to fragmentation of knowledge, unnecessary re-invention of ideas and practices, and inability to mobilize action at scale. For policymakers, this rich diversity is often simply overwhelming: they receive confusing messages as to what an <b>enabling</b> <b>policy</b> environment to address the full set of landscape values would look like.” ...|$|E
50|$|Some other {{policies}} in the administration included fiscal contraction {{in order to control}} and manage inflation (Balisacan and Hill, “The Philippine Economy” 110). The administration was also able to reorganize the National Economic and Development Authority, or NEDA, to its present form last July 22, 1987 and the Philippine Exporters’ Confederation (PHILEXPORT) in October 1991. The administration was also instrumental in introducing a new framework for infrastructure development which said that “the government should provide the <b>enabling</b> <b>policy</b> environment for greater private sector participation in infrastructure provision” (Balisacan and Hill, “The Dynamics” 330). As for industry dispersal and regional growth, the administration conceptualized and enforced the Local Government Code of 1991 which increased the autonomy and development of Local Government Units through decentralization.|$|E

30|$|Having {{argued the}} need for a policy-based approach, we now {{introduce}} SBUS[49], a middleware designed and developed to support the requirements of emerging healthcare. SBUS provides an open systems framework for securely reconfigurable components. Its main contribution lies in its support for policy-driven reconfiguration of components, and management of their interactions, with fully decentralised management. This <b>enables</b> <b>policy</b> to represent high-level concerns, to operate across applications to achieve users’ functional goals.|$|R
