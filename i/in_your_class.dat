2500|$|The NBL and the {{international}} UCI uses the [...] "Olympic" [...] or Moto System of advancing to the Main. In the Moto System, you must race all three times to make the main or if the race is a large one semi finals. It is a formula combining how well you do with all the registered participant riders <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>class</b> racing all three times. It cumulatively determines who will race in the finals. The higher your points total, {{the more likely you}} will advance. For instance if you come in 1st, 1st and 1st, 40+50+60, which is 150 points, you are a virtual certainty to race in the Main (or in large races you are merely transferred to the quarter/semi-finals) barring disqualification for some reason. If you come in Last, Last, First, which in a race with eight men <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>class</b> translates to 0+0+60 or 60 points, you MIGHT race in the main (or in larger races the 1/8/quarter/semi finals) determining how well the others did. The person who came in 3rd place in all three motos or 30+40+50=120p would have a much better shot at making the Main than you. Even the person who came in 2nd+6th+6th or 35+25+35=95 would have a better shot even if you won the final moto.|$|E

60|$|This is {{so clearly}} evident that {{to any one}} who {{believes}} self-seeking is the ruling motive, the only possible motive in mankind, it seems incredible that your class ever will do anything than oppose to the last the advancement of Socialism. You will fight for what you have, and the Have-nots will fight to take it away. Therefore {{it is that the}} Socialists of the Social Democratic Federation preach a class war; to my mind a lurid, violent and distasteful prospect. We shall {{have to get out of}} the miseries and disorder of to-day, they think, if not by way of chateau-burning and tumbrils, at least by a mitigated equivalent of that. But I am not of that opinion. I have a lurking belief that you are not altogether eaten up by the claims of your own magnificence. While there are no doubt a number of people <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>class</b> who would fight like rats in a corner against, let us say, the feeding of poor people's starving children or the recovery of the land by the State to which it once belonged, I believe there is enough of nobility <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>class</b> as a whole to considerably damp their resistance. Because you have silver mirrors and silver hairbrushes, it does not follow that you have not a conscience. I am no believer in the theory that to be a sans-culotte is to be morally impeccable, or that a man loses his soul because he possesses thirty pairs of trousers beautifully folded by a valet. I cherish the belief that your very refinement will turn--I have seen it in one or two fine minds visibly turning--against the social conditions that made it possible. All this space, all this splendour has its traceable connection with the insufficiencies and miseries from which you are so remote. Once that realization comes to you the world changes. In certain lights, correlated with that, your magnificence can look, you will discover--forgive the word!--a little vulgar....|$|E

So if a person is requested by a teacher to transact any business, or is elected to a public office, or appointed upon a committee,--leaving seats or speaking, so far as is really necessary for the accomplishing such a purpose, is considered as at {{the direction of}} teachers, and is consequently right. In the same manner, if a teacher should ask you individually, or give general notice to the members of class to come to her seat for private instruction, or to go to any part of the school-room for her, it would be right to do it. The distinction, you observe, is this. The teacher may of her own accord, direct any leaving of seats which she may think necessary to accomplish the objects of the school. She must not however, at the request of an individual for the sake of her mere private convenience, give her permission to speak or to leave her seat. If for example a teacher should say to you <b>in</b> <b>your</b> <b>class,</b> [...] "As soon as you have performed a certain work you may bring it to me,"--you would in bringing it, be acting under her direction and would consequently do right. If however you should want a pencil and should ask her to give you leave to borrow it, even if she should give you leave, you would do wrong to go, for you would not be acting at her direction, but simply by her consent, and she has no authority to grant consent.|$|E
