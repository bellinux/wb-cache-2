5|$|FitzRoy's {{instructions}} set {{detailed requirements}} for geological survey of a circular coral atoll to investigate how coral reefs formed, {{particularly if they}} rose {{from the bottom of}} the sea or from the summits of extinct volcanoes, and to assess the effects of tides by measurement with specially constructed gauges. FitzRoy chose the Keeling Islands in the Indian Ocean, and on arrival there on 1 April 1836, the entire crew set to work, first erecting FitzRoy's new design of a tide gauge that allowed readings to be taken from the shore. Boats were sent all around the island to carry out the survey, and despite being impeded by strong winds, they took numerous soundings to establish depths around the atoll and in the lagoon. FitzRoy noted the smooth and solid rock-like outer wall of the atoll, with most life thriving where the surf was most violent. He had great difficulty in establishing the depth reached by living coral, as pieces were <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> off and the small anchors, hooks, grappling irons, and chains they used were all snapped off by the swell as soon as they tried to pull them up. He had more success using a sounding line with a bell-shaped lead weight armed with tallow hardened with lime; this would be indented by any shape that it struck to give an exact impression of the bottom; it would also collect any fragments of coral or grains of sand.|$|E
25|$|During the {{beginning}} of the Buyid dynasty, their army consisted mainly of their fellow Daylamites, a warlike and brave people of mostly peasant origin, who served as foot soldiers. The Daylamites had a long history of military activity dating back to the Sasanian period, and had been mercenaries in various places in Iran and Iraq, and even as far as Egypt. The Daylamites, during a battle, normally bore a sword, a shield, and three spears. Furthermore, they were also known for their formidable shield formation, which was <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through.|$|E

He did manage his only two stumpings in 1990 (both of England players: Eddie Hemmings and Geoff Humpage), but his inferiority to Rhodes with the bat was painfully obvious: he batted at number ten, and in six first-class and one List A innings for the county, he made a grand total of 34 runs with a top score of just 10.|$|E

500|$|Following the match, Chelsea manager José Mourinho {{claimed that}} the gesture he made had been {{intended}} for the media and not Liverpool fans: [...] "The signal of close your mouth was not for them but for the press, they speak too much and in my opinion they try to do everything to disturb Chelsea. Wait, don't speak too soon. We lost two matches and in my opinion you (the media) try to take confidence from us and put pressure on us."

500|$|Motion City Soundtrack {{was formed}} in Minneapolis, Minnesota in 1997 by singer-songwriter Justin Pierre and guitarist Joshua Cain. By 1997, the duo had already played {{in a number of}} bands. Prior to {{founding}} Motion City Soundtrack, Cain was in a group named the Saddest Girl Story and Pierre was working on local productions. After other members left, Cain recruited Pierre to join the band as a singer. After Cain moved on from Boxcar, they founded Motion City Soundtrack together. The band's name, as well as the name of their debut album, were created by Cain's brother, Brian. Their early days were difficult, as they found it <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> out of their local Minneapolis scene. When they could get weeks off from their jobs, they would tour. According to Cain, the members of the band soon realized that there [...] "wasn't really anywhere to play [...] in Minneapolis", and {{that they would have to}} [...] "tour all the time" [...] to rise in popularity. The band went through several lineup changes. Through these, Cain and Pierre would often have to take over keyboard duties during shows. The group's first release was a 7" [...] single, [...] "Promenade / Carolina", released in 1999. Their next two releases, both extended plays—Kids for America and Back to the Beat—were released the following year.|$|E
500|$|Esther has {{a romantic}} {{interest}} in Rex Matheson (Mekhi Phifer), who she idealises {{and looks up}} to. Despite her feelings, Rex {{does not appear to}} notice or reciprocate, actress Alexa Havins conjectures that [...] "he's so blind to her feelings" [...] due to him having [...] "this wall built up around him that it's <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> through." [...] Phifer commented that Rex sees Esther as a sister and conjectures that Esther's interests in him are partly a result of her sensationalising his work. Despite her highly romanticised idea of field work, Esther is not as skilled in the field as more experienced agents Rex, Jack (John Barrowman) [...] and Gwen. However, being part of a new Torchwood team means that Esther is [...] "ripped away from her desk and thrust into the world of Torchwood on the run." [...] During the later parts of the series the character has to fight physically against the team's enemies. Havins did not receive any training for these sequences, she felt that having been trained in fight sequences would have made Esther [...] "too slick, too trained, too perfect, too in sync {{with the rest of the}} Torchwood crew." [...] Instead of being able to take out her attackers easily, when Esther has to fight for her life it is [...] "raw and brutal" [...] and [...] "almost like a bar-brawl meets a chick-fight". Espenson notes that by the final episode Esther has earned a degree of admiration from Rex through her work for the Torchwood team, which she feels to be because [...] "he just can't fail to see how smart and brave she is." [...] In regards to being killed off Havins states that she knew it was a possibility from the moment she accepted the role due to the danger present in the series and its precedence for killing characters. io9's Charlie Jane Anders observed that the character's death helps serve to illustrate [...] "how hard it is to consign others to death, for the greater good." ...|$|E

[...] Habitual behavior often goes unnoticed in persons exhibiting it, because a person does not need to engage in self-analysis when undertaking routine tasks. [...] Habits are sometimes compulsory. New behaviours can become automatic through the process of habit formation. Old habits are <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> and new habits are hard to form because the behavioural patterns which humans repeat become imprinted in neural pathways, but it is possible to form new habits through repetition.|$|E
2500|$|Modern {{cryptography}} {{is heavily}} based on mathematical theory {{and computer science}} practice; cryptographic algorithms are designed around computational hardness assumptions, making such algorithms <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> in practice by any adversary. It is theoretically possible to break such a system, but it is infeasible {{to do so by}} any known practical means. These schemes are therefore termed computationally secure; theoretical advances, e.g., improvements in integer factorization algorithms, and faster computing technology require these solutions to be continually adapted. There exist information-theoretically secure schemes that [...] cannot be broken even with unlimited computing power—an example is the one-time pad—but these schemes are more difficult to implement than the best theoretically breakable but computationally secure mechanisms.|$|E

2500|$|Such arguments, {{which usually}} {{refer to the}} notion of {{personal}} liberty, have themselves been criticised by Nobel Prize-winning economist Amartya Sen who defended smoke-free regulations on several grounds. Among other things, Sen argued that while a person may be free to acquire the habit of smoking, they thereby restrict their own freedom in the future given that the habit of smoking is <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>break.</b> Sen also pointed out the heavy costs that smoking inevitably imposes on every society which grants smokers unrestricted access to public services (which, Sen noted, every society that is not [...] "monstrously unforgiving" [...] would do). Arguments which invoke the notion of personal liberty against smoke-free laws are thus incomplete and inadequate, according to Sen.|$|E

He made his Test debut against New Zealand at the Gaddafi Stadium, Lahore on 9 October [...] 1976. He scored 163 and 25 not out in that match, and became the youngest batsman to score a century on debut, at the age of 19 years and 119 days; he also took a wicket in the match and Pakistan won the match by six wickets. In the third match of the same series, he scored a double century—206 runs at the National Stadium, Karachi. He broke George Headley's 47-year-old record, and became the youngest player—aged 19 years and 140 days—to score a double-century. He scored 85 runs in the second innings, failing to accomplish the unique feat of scoring a double-century and a century in a single match. Miandad was the highest run-scorer of the series, with 504 runs from five innings at the average of 126.00. His performance ensured Pakistan's victory in the three-match series by 2–0.|$|E

40|$|Cryptography {{is an art}} {{to protect}} secret {{information}} from attacks. This idea of information security leads {{to the evolution of}} cryptography. In this paper, an idea is proposed in which hill cipher is generated with Elliptic Curve Cryptography to provide better security and proper security coverage. Hill Cipher is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>break</b> due <b>to</b> its linearity and ECC is smaller key size algorithm which provide fast computations as well as memory, speed, bandwidth. ECC provides secure text based cryptography by generating base points on Elliptic curve over the finite field. It starts with plain text conversion by hill cipher then it is converted into its ASCII value to get points on curve and then perform scalar multiplication to encrypt the data and to generate secret and public key. Hill cipher with ECC improves efficiency of cryptography algorithm, provides better security and a level of complexity so that this technique is <b>harder</b> <b>to</b> <b>break...</b>|$|R
