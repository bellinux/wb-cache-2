500|$|About the shoot, Victoria Beckham commented: [...] "It took such a {{long time}} to film the 'Mama' video, but it was nice that our mums were there and could see what we're doing. It's good, because they were {{actually}} knackered {{at the end of the}} day and I said to my mum: 'Ha! Now you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> every day!" [...] Geri Halliwell commented: [...] "I found it a bit bizarre bringing my mum to work with me on the 'Mama' video. You know: 'This is what I do—come and do it, too.' If you worked in Sainsbury's, you wouldn't get your mum to sit with you on the till".|$|E
500|$|... "Tonight I stand here, overwhelmed, as my name {{is linked}} with the great and courageous Lou Gehrig. I'm truly humbled to have our names spoken in the same breath. This year has been unbelievable. I've been cheered in ballparks all over the country. People not only showed me their kindness, but more importantly, they {{demonstrated}} their {{love of the game}} of baseball. I give my thanks to baseball fans everywhere. Tonight, I {{want to make sure you}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> As I grew up here, I not only had dreams of being a big league ballplayer, but also of being a Baltimore Oriole. For all of your support over the years, I want to thank you, the fans of Baltimore, from the bottom of my heart. This is the greatest place to play." ...|$|E
2500|$|O'Day {{conveyed}} her {{hope that}} fans continue {{to honor the}} group that [...] "made her a star". [...] "Danity Kane was a wonderful group, and like all things, nothing is forever," [...] she said. [...] "We had a great run {{and we were very}} successful. We may not have that answer for our fans, which is disappointing, but we did try, and that's more than a lot of people." [...] O'Day said that though she is pursuing her own career as a solo artist, she would never turn down the chance to get onstage with her former bandmates. [...] "I have so much respect for that situation, if there was ever interest in me coming back ... and making music with the girls, I would never say no to something like that," [...] she said. [...] "In regards to the other negativity, I really just chose not to comment," [...] said O'Day. [...] "I wrote a blog on my MySpace page, and if anyone wants to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> they can go there." [...] O'Day later seemed to have more of a positive feeling about the whole situation. She stated, [...] "After being kicked out, I learned you have to fight to stay happy, and that takes forgiveness of yourself." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I {{used to make}} believe, Aaron, as you say," [...] Tommy replied sadly. [...] "If you <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{the folly}} of it now, perhaps even you would wish that I felt it less.|$|R
6000|$|... "Yes. Another {{one that}} can't sleep o' nights. Why? Don't you see why? Because, of course, she sees what's going on. That beast doesn't {{even try to}} keep it from her. If she had only the least bit of spirit! She <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> too, only she's too frightened even to look him in the face, let alone open her mouth. He would tell her to go hang herself." ...|$|R
50|$|If I {{am having}} {{problems}} or feeling unhappy, I often {{cover it up}} by joking around, so that even my closest friends don’t <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> really <b>feel.</b>|$|R
6000|$|... "I wonder," [...] said Stella, [...] "whether you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{those kind}} words of yours when you spoke of my mother. Shall I tell you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, I do," [...] said Bessie. [...] "The trouble is, I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> But if I ever do, Molly, I'll tell you! Is that fair?" ...|$|E
60|$|HECTOR. You are a most accursedly {{attractive}} woman. Mind, I am {{not making}} love to you. I do not like being attracted. But you had better <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> {{if you are going}} to stay here.|$|E
6000|$|... 'I do. You don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> mean <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> You've {{been real}} nice to me, George. Thought I'd look {{in and say}} I was sorry. Good night, George!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Indeed it does: I cannot like it. I {{love this}} house and {{everything}} in it: I shall love nothing there. You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> uncomfortable <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> with her." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Everything!" [...] she answered, {{her eyes}} {{suddenly}} seeking the carpet. [...] "I {{thank you all}} for what you have said and done for me. To-morrow, I think, <b>I</b> shall <b>know</b> better <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about these things." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "You {{know what}} I have come for, Miss Greendale," [...] he began at once. [...] "I {{think that you}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> towards you, and how deeply I love you. I have come {{to ask you to}} be my wife." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "He won't do that. You see {{the great}} thing is the house and park. We should both want that;--shouldn't we? Of course it must be yours; and I feel--I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> in asking you {{whether you want to}} sell it." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Yes, you have! You've got {{everything}} to do with it, if you'll say one thing first. Cynthia, you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about you. It's been so ever since we were boy and girl here. I want you to promise to marry me. Will you?" ...|$|E
6000|$|Young Clinton Ward {{also came}} seeking, boyish, eager, contemptuous of any barrier so illusory {{as the fact}} of her trances, which she confessed to him. Her words hardly {{impressed}} themselves on his mind, and he replied, flippantly: [...] "That cuts no ice with me. You couldn't be anything I wouldn't like. You're living too close and your nerves are sort of frazzled. What {{you need is a}} jolly good time. Come back to Boston and forget all about this business. Come, I want folks to meet you. My mother <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about you, and is crazy to see you." ...|$|R
60|$|Your remembrance {{at such a}} time--not {{thrown away}} upon me, trust me--is a {{sufficient}} assurance that you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> truly <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> towards you, and with what an earnest sympathy I must think of you now.|$|R
5000|$|On the 9 July 2013, Martin agreed a new three-year {{deal with}} the club. This {{contract}} will keep him at the club until 2016. When asked about the new deal he told the club's official website: [...] "in extremely delighted, everybody <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about playing for this football club. Since I first arrived here it's gone unbelievably well and <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> really settled in the area. I'm happy playing for this club and I've got a great relationship with the players, staff and the supporters, and I'm just delighted {{to be here for}} another 3 years." [...] On 10 August 2013, he was officially named the club captain.|$|R
6000|$|... "I'm {{not sorry}} for that; {{it may help}} you to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> Will you kindly answer me a question?" [...] Isabel made no audible assent, but he {{apparently}} saw in her eyes something that gave him courage to go on. [...] "Do you prefer some one else?" ...|$|E
6000|$|... 'Indeed, Anne,' said Helen, 'I do not {{wonder that}} you are shocked, {{but you do not}} <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> here. At Dykelands I felt that people liked me and were pleased with me, but at home nobody wants me, nobody cares for me, I am in the way {{wherever}} I go.' ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Well, you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about you, Colonel Sellers, {{and always}} have felt. It {{seems to me}} that you always know {{everything}} about everything. If that man had known you as I know you he would have taken your judgment at the start, and dropped his dry battery where it was." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Don't {{be angry}} with me, Archdeacon: don't let us quarrel about it, Susan. If you <b>knew</b> <b>how</b> keenly <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> the {{necessity}} of having to disoblige you in this matter, you would not {{be angry with}} me." ...|$|R
5000|$|... "I think {{everyone}} <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about being at this football club. The supporters, players and management have been absolutely fantastic to me over these past {{four months and}} I desperately wanted to stay here because I love it so much. I know I have only been here a few months, but it really does <b>feel</b> like <b>I</b> {{have been here for}} years. The atmosphere around the place is brilliant, so I am looking forward to the fact that I am here at Stoke now for the long term and back in the best league in the world." [...] Pennant on his permanent transfer to Stoke City.|$|R
6000|$|... "Please forgive me, Mr. Givens, won't you? I'm only a girl, you know, and I {{was frightened}} at first. I'm very, very sorry I shot Bill. You don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> ashamed <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> <b>I</b> wouldn't {{have done it}} for anything." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I feel fine," [...] said he, [...] "beyond a {{touch of}} the I-don't-know-what-you-call-its. I feel like {{there was going to be}} {{earthquakes}} or music or a trifle of chills and fever or maybe a picnic. I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> I feel like knocking the face off a policeman, or else maybe like playing Coney Island straight across the board from pop-corn to the elephant houdahs." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Carl, I thought I {{could trust}} you. You've done wrong--don't you know it? You've made my old heart ache. When you get old {{and have a}} little girl you may <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel,</b> but you can't now. I don't know what I can say to you. I don't know what I {{am going to do}} about it, but I want you to know what you've done to me--both of you. Look into my face now--you too, Rose--look into your old father's face!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I suppose I may {{be allowed}} to <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> myself," [...] said the squire. [...] "But don't keep Will up here when he wants his dinner. There; that'll do. You'd better leave me now." [...] Then Will went out to his old room, and {{a quarter of an}} hour {{afterwards}} he found himself seated with Clara at the dinner-table; and {{a quarter of an hour}} after that the dinner was over, and they had both drawn their chairs to the fire.|$|E
6000|$|... "We must forgive him, Mr. Gordon. <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> should <b>feel</b> {{towards a}} man who took Kilmeny from me. It was an evil impulse to which he gave way in his suffering--and think of the good which has {{resulted}} from it." ...|$|R
5000|$|Irons had a much-publicized, and, {{according}} to him, over-hyped, rivalry with fellow professional surfer Kelly Slater. In an interview, Irons said:"For me, just being affiliated with Kelly--to {{be next to}} him--I mean, that's awesome. He's the ultimate surfer. He's the best surfer in the world. Ever. Best competitive, best free surfer, you name it, and to have my name put next to his everywhere really is flattering. He's the Michael Jordan of our sport. Kelly <b>knows</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about him. Despite all the media hype {{that comes out of}} a rivalry there's a lot of respect given both ways. People don't realize there are times when we hang out. We'll go check the waves together. We talk about boards. He invited me personally to his contest on Tavarua. There's a ton of respect there." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> may <b>feel</b> {{about it}} {{tomorrow}} morning," [...] I said; [...] "but my impulse {{at this moment}} is decidedly to see him again. I had a little talk with him while you were away {{at the other end}} of the room, and I believe he really can be of use to me--" ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Well, {{if a man}} can be noble at {{the same}} time he's terrible, you've been, Russ--I don't <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel.</b> I'm sick and I can't think. I see, though, what you saved Diane and Steele. Why, she's {{touching}} happiness again, fearfully, yet really. Think of that! God only knows what you did for Steele. If I judged it by his suffering as you lay there about to die it would be beyond words to tell. But, Russ, you're pale and shaky now. Hush! No more talk!" ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Look here! You <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about Mrs Adding! I've {{been pretty}} frank with Mr. March myself, and I've had my suspicions that she's been frank with you, Mrs. March. There isn't {{any doubt about}} my wanting to marry her, and up to this time there hasn't been any doubt about her not wanting to marry me. But it isn't a {{question}} of her or of me, now. It's a question of Rose. I love the boy," [...] and Kenby's voice shook, and he faltered a moment. [...] "Pshaw! You understand." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "Dear Fan," [...] said Constance, [...] "let us {{say no more}} to vex each other; {{the remark}} I made was a very {{harmless}} one. And you forget, dear, that I am different to you and Mary--that words about some things, though spoken in jest, may hurt me very much." [...] After a while she continued hesitatingly-- [...] "I am sure that neither of you {{will return to the}} subject when you <b>know</b> <b>how</b> <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> about it. I shall never love again. To others my husband is dead, but not to me; his place can be taken by no other." ...|$|E
6000|$|They {{moved away}} as Mrs. Grant flung herself weeping on Mary's flat chest, under the lych-gate, and cried, 'I <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it <b>feels!</b> <b>I</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> it feels!' ...|$|R
6000|$|... "In {{this house}} you are {{different}} from other people," [...] replies Harry. [...] "I don't <b>know</b> <b>how,</b> but <b>I</b> always <b>feel</b> quiet and happy somehow when I come to you." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "Isobel," [...] he began, [...] "I {{need not}} tell you that I love you; till lately <b>I</b> have not <b>known</b> <b>how</b> much, but <b>I</b> <b>feel</b> now that <b>I</b> could not live without you." ...|$|R
