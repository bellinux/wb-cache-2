40|$|Abstract. The {{calculus}} of pregroups {{is introduced}} by Lambek [1999] as an algebraic computational {{system for the}} grammatical analysis of natural languages. Pregroups are non commutative structures, but the syntax of natural languages shows a diffuse presence of cyclic patterns exhibited in different kinds of word order changes. The need of cyclic operations or transformations was envisaged both by Z. Harris and N. Chomsky, {{in the framework of}} <b>generative</b> <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar.</b> In this paper we propose an extension of the calculus of pregroups by introducing appropriate cyclic rules that will allow the grammar to formally analyze and compute word order and movement phenomena in different languages such as Persian, French, Italian, Dutch and Hungarian. This cross-linguistic analysis, although necessarily limited and not at all exhaustive, will allow the reader to grasp the essentials of a pregroup grammar, with particular reference to its straightforward way of computing linguistic information. ...|$|E

It is noted, for example, that semantic differences between corresponding actives and passives are not consistent across these diverse types of predicates. It is argued that contrasts between corresponding actives and passives as well as differences in well-formedness among passives depend on the interaction between predication properties and inherent properties of passive constructions. Distinctive information structure properties of passives are explored in some detail, and it is argued that sentences are well-formed to the extent that their predication properties are compatible with the distinctive functions of passive structure in discourse. The English passive is regarded in this discussion as the vehicle for various information structure options including the option to set the object as topic and/or theme and the option to include a specified by-phrase agent by means of a separate predication...|$|E

Evidence is given {{to show that it}} is advantageous to consider Hokkien as a topic-prominent language and to assume that every sentence is underlyingly (though not necessarily superficially) a topic-comment structure [...] an analysis that is more suitable for Hokkien than the traditional S→NP VP analysis. In conjunction with this, a number of object-initial constructions are examined and are found to be informationally conditioned, requiring the initial noun phrase to be given information. In contrast to these are passive constructions where the initial noun phrases are logical objects which can be either definite or indefinite. These are not informationally constrained but rather they are semantically constrained, requiring the initial noun phrases to be Patients. With respect to syntactic structure, we argue that there is an important dichotomy in Hokkien [...] a dichotomy between Indicative mood sentences and Injunctive mood sentences. Injunctive mood sentences are subjectless structures which are restricted as to verb type, aspect, type of negation, time reference and complementizers. Indicative mood sentences are much freer in these respects. Where Injunctive mood sentences require zero pronominalization in subject position, Indicatives require lexical proforms. Semantically, Injunctive mood sentences represent only actions and the actions are always unrealized. In short, this dissertation demonstrates that two kinds of phenomena are involved in Hokkien structure, the first being information structure and the second, sentence moo...|$|E

In sports, there is a certain style of register that is produced by sport commentators. One of the sports that has unique characteristics of register is football. The language of football commentators, which is a play-by-play commentary, often occurs in the form of telegraphic speech, that is consisting a lot of syntactic reduction and inversion. Thus, it is interesting to find out the grammatical structure produced by football commentators, and the reason why they use that kind of grammatical structure. According to Janet Holmes (1992), a play-by-play description used by sport announcers will not cause the lost of meaning and the reference of the speech is not ambiguous since the addressee can see it in the picture shown. In the analysis of the grammatical structure of football commentators, the writer uses the <b>generative</b> <b>transformational</b> <b>grammar,</b> because it can describe more effectively the process and the relations between sentences that are inverted, substituted, or deleted. This study uses qualitative approach in order to find out the characteristics of the register of football commentators, and the reasons why they have the characteristics.

The writer will then make the transcription of the commentary and analyse the grammatical structure, then put it in the tables.
