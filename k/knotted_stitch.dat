5000|$|A senninbari {{could be}} made by a man's mother, sister, or wife if married, who would stand near their local temple, train station, or {{department}} store and ask any female passerby to sew in a French <b>knot</b> <b>stitch.</b> During the most hectic days of the War {{in order to meet}} demand, women's patriotic organizations would gather to make senninbari en masse. These were then placed in imonbukuro or comfort bags and sent overseas to the soldiers. According to the custom, any woman born in the [...] "year of the Tiger" [...] could sew either 12 stitches or a number of stitches that added up to her age. Some belts were lined with the woman/women's hair as an added form of protection. The custom of placing hair in bags or pouches as a good luck charm, dates to early folk belief found on the island of Okinawa. Additionally, coins could be sewn into the belt as an amulet as well.|$|R

50|$|A Senninbari (thousand-person-stitches) or One-thousand stitch is a {{strip of}} cloth that {{measures}} approximately 6 inches high and up to 3 or 4 feet or more in length. Each end of the belt (sash) {{may or may not}} have strings, snaps or buttons that allow it to be fastened about the waist. Examples that lack these were often tucked into the waist. Other variations were never worn but may have been folded and placed inside helmet liners, pockets or packs. Senninbari were decorated with 1000 <b>knots</b> or <b>stitches,</b> and each stitch was normally made by a different woman. Senninbari were given as an amulet by women to soldiers on their way to war as a part of the Shinto culture of Imperial Japan.|$|R

5000|$|Tatting is a {{technique}} for handcrafting a particularly durable lace {{from a series of}} knots and loops. Tatting {{can be used to make}} lace edging as well as doilies, collars, accessories such as earrings and necklaces, and other decorative pieces. The lace is formed by a pattern of rings and chains formed from a series of cow hitch or half-hitch <b>knots,</b> called double <b>stitches,</b> over a core thread. Gaps can be left between the stitches to form picots, which are used for practical construction as well as decorative effect.|$|R
50|$|The {{custom of}} {{producing}} senninbari originated during the First Sino-Japanese War of 1894-1895. In their earliest forms, senninbari were small handkerchief sized pieces of square material that contained 1000 <b>knots</b> or <b>stitches</b> applied {{to it in}} order to impart strength to the material. The implication of this was that as an amulet, or good luck piece, compounded strength or luck was to be passed along to the man carrying it. In general, senninbari and later one-thousand stitch belts were believed to confer courage, good luck and immunity from injury (especially bullets) upon their wearers. Some Japanese soldiers rejected the belief that the senninbari could protect them from harm. Instead, they felt that this good luck item would simply allow them to be in the position to inflict the greatest damage upon the enemy before offering their life up in battle. Others in the military wore the senninbari as a devotional to the women back home.|$|R
30|$|The graft was {{prepared}} {{as described by}} Snow et al. (Snow et al. 2012). Briefly, the tendon was cut to be 240 [*]mm long and the two ends of the tendon were whip-stitched as described previously. The tendon was measured and marked to identify three equal segments. One third of the tendon was passed through the Endobutton CL loop and the remaining two thirds was folded onto itself and the free end with whip stitch was secured to the Endobutton CL loop with a surgical knot consisting of four square <b>knots.</b> Luggage tag <b>stitch</b> {{was placed on the}} folded end to facilitate graft holding (Fig. 1).|$|R
5000|$|In 1838 the Royal Navy Captain Drinkwater Bethune of [...] {{first came}} across the reef and {{recorded}} it; it was first mapped by the British several years later by Captain Denham of HMS Herald. Three recent shipwrecks (1979, 1981 and 2008) have occurred on the reef, the latest being a Chinese fishing vessel (San Sheng No. 168). There were earlier wrecks, for instance the brig Rapid, under Captain Arthur Devlin, ran aground on the reef at 0200 h on 14 January 1841, making 7 <b>knots</b> with every <b>stitch</b> of sail set, the lookout having been set but apparently not kept. Later, the ship Logan, of New Bedford, under Captain Wells, was wrecked on “Sandy Island Reef” {Conway Reef} {{on the night of}} 26 January 1855.|$|R
5000|$|Claire Zeisler (April 18, 1903 - September 30, 1991) was a noted American fiber {{artist who}} {{expanded}} the expressive qualities of knotted and braided threads, pioneering large-scale freestanding sculptures in this medium. Throughout her career Zeisler sought to create [...] "large, strong, single images" [...] with fiber. Zeisler's non-functional structures were constructed using traditional weaving and avant-garde off the loom {{techniques such as}} square <b>knotting,</b> wrapping, and <b>stitching.</b> Zeisler preferred to work with natural materials such as jute, sisal, raffia, hemp, wool, and leather. The textiles were often left un-dyed, evidence of Zeisler's preference for natural coloration that emphasized the fiber itself. When she used color, however, Zeisler gravitated towards red. Her work is influenced by and has influenced fiber artists in the 1960s and 70s such as Kay Sekimachi, Barbara Shawcroft, Lenore Tawney, Magdalena Abakanowicz, and Sheila Hicks.|$|R
50|$|The imagery Green {{has used}} {{throughout}} his entire career, {{and continues to}} use to this day, is drawn from illustrated textbooks and advertising of the forties and fifties that touch on technological and roadside Americana, with overt themes of sexual symbolism. Imagery includes ice cream cones, bridges, incomplete bridges, mirrors, scissors, women's painted fingernails, passionate couples, tires, moons floating over water, puzzle pieces, silhouettes of a plane flying overhead, searchlights, tornados, women's nylon-covered legs, wood grain, leather cords, screws, cables, <b>knots,</b> zippers, tapes, <b>stitches,</b> Necker cubes, and other optical illusions. The paintings tend to have torn or stitched imagery that evokes the trompe l'oeil tradition; transparent and solid planes overlap, too, achieving {{a high level of}} spatial complexity. Though the illusory depth of his paintings is not all that deep, the viewer still finds himself looking at, into, and through his paintings.|$|R
40|$|OBJETIVO: Comparar a sutura do tubo digestivo em plano único com pontos totais simples versus pontos especiais de Gambee. MÉTODOS: Foram operados seis cães machos, sem raça definida, pesando entre 7 e 12 kg, anestesiados com {{pentobarbital}} sódico a 30 mg/kg. Foi realizada secção transversa do jejuno, a 30 cm da flexura duodenojejunal, seguida de anastomose término-terminal com a técnica de sutura em plano único total descrita por Gambee, sendo a metade anterior da anastomose suturada com nós atados na superfície serosa e a metade posterior com nós atados sobre a camada mucosa, no lume do órgão. Foram utilizados pontos simples separados de polipropileno monofilamentar azul 4 - 0, pré-montados em agulha de 2 cm (3 / 8 de círculo), intervalados de 3 mm. No 7 º dia pós-operatório os animais foram sacrificados e necropsiados. Foram analisadas as aderências na linha de sutura mediante um escore e feita análise macroscópica e microscópica, inclusive histometria. RESULTADOS: As aderências peritoneais se equivaleram em ambas as faces da anastomose. O exame macroscópico da linha de sutura mostrou boa regeneração serosa. Na microscopia observava-se permanência de fenômenos inflamatórios agudos em ambas as suturas. O realinhamento, a reestruturação e a regeneração das camadas foram adequadas em todo o perímetro da anastomose. Na morfometria, os polimorfonucleares, os macrófagos, os fibroblastos e as fibras colágenas se equivaleram nas duas metades comparadas da anastomose. CONCLUSÃO: A reparação do tubo digestivo na região anastomótica em plano único total pela técnica de Gambee se faz de forma similar, quer tenham sido utilizados pontos de sutura especiais de Gambee ou pontos totais simples. Dessa forma, é indiferente a utilização de um ou de outro tipo de sutura aqui estudado, dependendo exclusivamente da preferência do cirurgião. PURPOSE: To compare {{two types}} of single layer thru-and-thru sutures of the digestive tract: Gambee's <b>stitches</b> with <b>knots</b> fastened in the serosal surface versus simple <b>stitches</b> <b>knotted</b> in the intestinal lumen, under the mucosa. METHODS: Six male mongrel dogs were operated weighing between 7 and 12 kg, anesthetized with sodic pentobarbital to 30 mg/kg. Transverse section of the jejunum was accomplished, to 30 cm of the angle of Treitz, followed by end-to-end anastomosis with interrupted single layer Gambee's stitches fastened in the serosal surface in the anterior half-part of the anastomosis and simple <b>stitches</b> <b>knotted</b> in the viscous lumen, under the mucosal layer, in the posterior half-part of the anastomosis. After slaughter at the 7 th postoperative day the peritoneal adhesions were analyzed in the suture line by a score and macroscopic and microscopic analysis were made. RESULTS: Peritoneal adhesions were equivalent in both types of sutures. The intestinal loop showed good serosal regeneration at the suture line. Under microscopy view, residuals acute inflammatory phenomena remain in both sutures. Sparse focus of ischemic necrosis of the mucosa was observed along the suture line, in both types of sutures. Realignment and regeneration of the layers were present along the entire perimeter of the anastomose. In the morphometric analysis, the neutrophils, the macrophages, the fibroblasts and the collagenous fibers were equivalent in number in the two compared half-perimeters of the anastomose. CONCLUSION: The repair of the digestive tract in the anastomotic area after single layer sutures by the technique of Gambee is made in a similar way, despite of special Gambee's stitches or simple total sutures have been used. In that way, it is indifferent the use of both suture type here studied, depending exclusively on the surgeon's preference...|$|R
60|$|Know, O incredulous reader! that {{a master}} {{stands in a}} {{somewhat}} different relation towards a pretty, light-headed, probably ignorant girl, to that occupied by a partner at a ball, or a gallant on the promenade. A professor does not meet his pupil to see her dressed in satin and muslin, with hair perfumed and curled, neck scarcely shaded by aerial lace, round white arms circled with bracelets, feet dressed for the gliding dance. It is not his business to whirl her through the waltz, to feed her with compliments, to heighten her beauty by the flush of gratified vanity. Neither does he encounter her on the smooth-rolled, tree shaded Boulevard, in the green and sunny park, whither she repairs clad in her becoming walking dress, her scarf thrown with grace over her shoulders, her little bonnet scarcely screening her curls, the red rose under its brim adding a new tint to the softer rose on her cheek; her face and eyes, too, illumined with smiles, perhaps as transient as the sunshine of the gala-day, but also quite as brilliant; it is not his office to walk by her side, {{to listen to her}} lively chat, to carry her parasol, scarcely larger than a broad green leaf, to lead in a ribbon her Blenheim spaniel or Italian greyhound. No: he finds her in the schoolroom, plainly dressed, with books before her. Owing to her education or her nature books are to her a nuisance, and she opens them with aversion, yet her teacher must instil into her mind the contents of these books; that mind resists the admission of grave information, it recoils, it grows restive, sullen tempers are shown, disfiguring frowns spoil the symmetry of the face, sometimes coarse gestures banish grace from the deportment, while muttered expressions, redolent of native and ineradicable vulgarity, desecrate the sweetness of the voice. Where the temperament is serene though the intellect be sluggish, an unconquerable dullness opposes every effort to instruct. Where there is cunning but not energy, dissimulation, falsehood, a thousand schemes and tricks are put in play to evade the necessity of application; in short, to the tutor, female youth, female charms are like tapestry hangings, of which the wrong side is continually turned towards him; and even when he sees the smooth, neat external surface he so well knows what <b>knots,</b> long <b>stitches,</b> and jagged ends are behind that he has scarce a temptation to admire too fondly the seemly forms and bright colours exposed to general view.|$|R
