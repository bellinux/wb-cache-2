5|$|The {{earliest}} pathologic {{change is}} {{the formation of a}} plug (a microcomedone), which is driven primarily by excessive growth, reproduction, and accumulation of skin cells in the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle.</b> In normal skin, the skin cells that have died come up to the surface and exit the pore of the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle.</b> However, increased production of oily sebum in those with acne causes the dead skin cells to stick together. The accumulation of dead skin cell debris and oily sebum blocks the pore of the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle,</b> thus forming the microcomedone. This is further exacerbated by the biofilm created by P. acnes within the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle.</b> If the microcomedone is superficial within the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle,</b> the skin pigment melanin is exposed to air, resulting in its oxidation and dark appearance (known as a blackhead or open comedo). In contrast, if the microcomedone occurs deep within the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle,</b> this causes the formation of a whitehead (known as a closed comedo).|$|E

5|$|Sebaceous glands {{are found}} in hair-covered areas, where they are {{connected}} to hair follicles. One or more glands may surround each <b>hair</b> <b>follicle,</b> and the glands themselves are surrounded by arrector pili muscles. The glands have an acinar structure (like a many-lobed berry), in which multiple glands branch off a central duct. Relative to keratinocytes {{that make up the}} <b>hair</b> <b>follicle,</b> sebaceous glands are composed of huge cells with many large vesicles that contain the sebum. These cells express Na+ and Cl− ion channels, ENaC and CFTR (see Fig. 6 and Fig. 7 in reference).|$|E
40|$|We {{previously}} {{demonstrated that}} whole <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> could be cryopreserved {{to maintain their}} stem-cells differentation potential. In the present study, we demonstrated that cryopreserved mouse whisker <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> maintain their <b>hair</b> growth potential. DMSO better cryopreserved mouse whisker follicles compared to glycerol. Cryopreserved <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> also maintained the hair follicle-associated-pluripotent (HAP) stem cells, evidenced by P 75 NTR expression. Subcutaneous transplantation of DMSO-cryopreserved <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> in nude mice resulted in extensive hair fiber growth over 8 weeks, indicating the functional recovery of hair shaft growth of cryopreserved <b>hair</b> <b>follicles...</b>|$|R
40|$|Background Human <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> are {{important}} for the renewal of new hairs and their development. The generation of {{induced pluripotent stem cells}} (iPSCs) from <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> is easy due to its accessibility and availability. The pluripotent cells derived from <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> not only have a higher tendency to re-differentiate into <b>hair</b> <b>follicles,</b> but are also more suited for growth in hair scalp tissue microenvironment. Methods In this study, human hair follicular keratinocytes were used to generate iPSCs, which were then further differentiated in vitro into keratinocytes. The derived iPSCs were characterised by using immunofluorescence staining, flow cytometry, and reverse-transcription PCR to check for its pluripotency markers expression. Results The iPSC clones expressed pluripotency markers such as TRA- 1 - 60, TRA- 1 - 81, SSEA 4, OCT 4, SOX 2, NANOG, LEFTY, and GABRB. The well-formed three germ layers were observed during differentiation using iPSCs derived from <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b> The successful formation of keratioctyes from iPSCs was confirmed by the expression of cytokeratin 14 marker. Discussion <b>Hair</b> <b>follicles</b> represent a valuable keratinocytes source for in vitro hair cloning for use in treating hair balding or grafting in burn patients. Our significant findings in this report proved that <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> could be used to produce pluripotent stem cells and suggested that the genetic and micro-environmental elements of <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> might trigger higher and more efficient <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> re-differentiation...|$|R
40|$|The uptake and {{catabolism}} of tritiated testosterone by <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> {{from both}} the bald and hairy regions of the scalp and back of stumptailed macaques were studied in vitro. Testosterone was incorporated into the anagen and telogen stages of both terminal and vellus <b>hair</b> <b>follicles,</b> and its major metabolite appeared to be androstenedione. As a rule, the follicles from the scalp had higher metabolic rates {{than those of the}} back. Metabolic activity was higher in the bulb than in the outer root sheath. The total rates of testosterone incorporation and catabolism by the vellus <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> from the bald scalp and the terminal <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> from the hairy scalp were not markedly different. However, testosterone was catabolized much faster and was retained less by the vellus follicles than by the terminal follicles. The ratio of the metabolites/testosterone was greater than 1 in both the anagen and telogen <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> of the frontal bald region. This is the first biochemical finding that gives some characterization to <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> from the bald scalp. The physiological significance of the accumulation of biologically rather inactive androstenedione in vellus <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> remains unexplained...|$|R
5|$|Scientists {{initially}} {{hypothesized that}} acne represented {{a disease of}} the skin's <b>hair</b> <b>follicle,</b> and occurred due to blockage of the pore by sebum. During the 1880s, bacteria were observed by microscopy in skin samples affected by acne and were regarded as the causal agents of comedones, sebum production, and ultimately acne. During the mid-twentieth century, dermatologists realized that no single hypothesized factor (sebum, bacteria, or excess keratin) could completely explain the disease. This led to the current understanding that acne {{could be explained by}} a sequence of related events, beginning with blockage of the skin follicle by excessive dead skin cells, followed by bacterial invasion of the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle</b> pore, changes in sebum production, and inflammation.|$|E
5|$|The glands deposit sebum on the hairs, {{and bring}} it to the skin surface along the hair shaft. The {{structure}} consisting of hair, <b>hair</b> <b>follicle,</b> arrector pili muscles, and sebaceous gland is an epidermal invagination known as a pilosebaceous unit.|$|E
5|$|The {{cutaneous}} {{manifestations of}} Birt–Hogg–Dubé were originally described as fibrofolliculomas (abnormal growths of a <b>hair</b> <b>follicle),</b> trichodiscomas (hamartomatous lesions with a <b>hair</b> <b>follicle</b> at the periphery, often {{found on the}} face), and acrochordons (skin tags). Cutaneous manifestations are confirmed by histology. Most individuals (89%) with BHD are found to have multiple cysts in both lungs, and 24% have had one or more episodes of pneumothorax. The cysts can be detected by chest CT scan. Renal tumors can manifest as multiple types of renal cell carcinoma, but certain pathological subtypes (including chromophobe, oncocytoma, and oncocytic hybrid tumors) are more commonly seen. Although the original syndrome was discovered {{on the basis of}} cutaneous findings, it is now recognized that individuals with Birt–Hogg–Dubé may only manifest the pulmonary and/or renal findings, without any skin lesions. Though these signs indicate BHD, it is only confirmed with a genetic test for FLCN mutations.|$|E
40|$|A {{technique}} for genetic modification of <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> was developed {{which results in}} efficient alteration of the hair shaft phenotype. High-level in vivo transgene expression was maintained in <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> such that growing hair shafts were phenotypically altered. Mouse anagen skin fragments, maintained in histoculture, were genetically modified at high efficiency with adenoviral-GFP. The histocultured skin fragments were treated with collagenase which made <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> accessible to the adenoviral GFP gene, allowing high-efficiency transduction. These skin fragments were subsequently grafted on to nude mice where GFP was readily visualized {{in as many as}} 75 % of <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b> Most follicles produced GFP-fluorescent growing hair shafts. This technique has produced efficient genetic modification of the hair shaft...|$|R
40|$|Synopsis [...] Recent {{investigations}} on the METABOLISM and metabolic control mechanis•ns of HUMAN HAIR FOLLICLES {{to elucidate}} certain molecular bases for the etiologic factors of common baldness are summarized. Studies on CARBOHYDRATE metabolism, TESTOSTERONE metabolism, and the ADENYL CYCLASE system of human <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> suggest the following mechanisms of {{transformation of the}} <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> from the terminal to the veilus type: Testosterone carried in plasma reaches the <b>hair</b> <b>follicles,</b> where it is converted to 5 a-dihydrotestosteronc, a tissue-active androgen. Since the <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> have sufficient 5 a-reductase to catalyze this conversion, the intracellular level of TPNH is presumed to be the rate-limiting factor at this step. The growing <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> appear to generate sufficient TPNH via the penrose cycle. Probably 5 a-dihydrotestosterone but not testosterone is the tissue-active androgen, since adenyl cyclase in the <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> is markedly inhibited by 5 a-dihydrotestosterone but not by testosterone. Inhibition of adenyl cyclase decreases the intracellular level of cyclic AMP. This decrease of cyclic AMP, in turn, will create premature completion of the anagen state. Years of repetition of this premature completion probably produces the short veilus-type <b>hairs</b> and <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b> Although solid proof for the entire process of BALDNESS is not yet available, the initial roles played by 5 a-dihydrotestosterone and adenyl cyclase are highly significant in these complex mechanisms...|$|R
40|$|Mice {{homozygous}} for the patchwork (pwk) {{recessive mutation}} are salt and pepper: their coat contains {{a mixture of}} unpigmented and fully pigmented hairs, but no partially pigmented hairs 1. In the matrix of pwk/pwk unpigmented <b>hair</b> <b>follicles,</b> there are no mature melanocyte. This phenotype could be due to: (i) absence of the melanocyte stem cell (MSC) population, (ii) impaired differentiation of MSC into transit amplifying cells (TA cells), (iii) inhibition of TA cells proliferation and/or migration, or (iv) death of melanoblasts within the proliferative compartment. To discriminate between these hypotheses, we used transgenic mice expressing reporter genes for the melanocyte lineage, namely Dct-lacZ and Pax 3 GFP 2. We validated the Pax 3 GFP reporter strain by comparing its labelling of melanocyte lineage to Dct-lacZ’s. In pwk/pwk <b>hair</b> <b>follicles,</b> whatever the <b>hair</b> color, MSC and TA cells are present though in reduced number in the bulge and in the transitory portion respectively. In pwk/pwk unpigmented <b>hair</b> <b>follicles,</b> some TA cells reach the bulb region where they remain undifferentiated. By contrast, in the bulb of pwk/pwk pigmented <b>hair</b> <b>follicles,</b> TA cells are more numerous and differentiate into functional melanocytes. To test whether the impaired differentiation in the unpigmented <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> {{is related to the}} lower number of melanoblasts, we dissected pwk/pwk; Dct-lacZ/Dct-lacZ or pwk/pwk; Pax 3 GFP/+ and control <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> and counted cells of the melanocyte lineage within single <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b> Which process (survival, proliferation and/or migration) is deficient in the transit amplifying population is under investigation...|$|R
5|$|Retinoids are {{medications}} which reduce inflammation, normalize the {{follicle cell}} life cycle, and reduce sebum production. They are structurally related to vitamin A. The retinoids appear {{to influence the}} cell life cycle in the follicle lining. This helps prevent the accumulation of skin cells within the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle</b> that can create a blockage. They are a first-line acne treatment, especially for people with dark-colored skin, and are known to lead to faster improvement of postinflammatory hyperpigmentation.|$|E

50|$|Research {{indicates}} that the initial programming of pilosebaceous units of <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> begins in utero. The physiology is primarily androgenic, with dihydrotestosterone (DHT) the major contributor at the dermal papillae. Men with premature androgenic alopecia tend to have lower than normal values of sex hormone-binding globulin (SHBG), follicle stimulating hormone (FSH), testosterone, and epitestosterone when compared to men without pattern hair loss. Although <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> were previously thought to be permanently gone in areas of complete hair loss, {{they are more likely}} dormant, as recent studies have shown the scalp contains the stem cell progenitor cells from which the follicles arose. This however, only applies to non scarring hair loss, which preserves the <b>hair</b> <b>follicles,</b> unlike scarring <b>hair</b> loss, which completely destroys the <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b>|$|R
40|$|We have {{previously}} described spontaneous but reversible hair loss that clinically and histologically resembles human alopecia areata in {{a colony of}} C 3 H/HeJ mice. Alopecia areata in humans is associated with antibodies to <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b> This {{study was conducted to}} determine whether C 3 H/HeJ mice with hair loss have a similar abnormal antibody response to <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b> Eighteen C 3 H/HeJ mice with alopecia, 12 unaffected littermates, and 15 control mice were examined for circulating antibodies to C 3 H/HeJ anagen <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> by indirect immunofluorescence and against extracts of isolated C 3 H/HeJ and human anagen <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> by immunoblotting. Using both procedures, antibodies to anagen <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> were present in all C 3 H/HeJ mice with alopecia but in none of the control mice. The antibodies were also present in some unaffected C 3 H/HeJ littermates but were absent in mice of an unrelated strain with inflammatory skin disease and alopecia, indicating that their appearance did not result from the hair loss. These antibodies reacted to hair follicle–specific antigens of 40 – 60 kDa present in murine and human anagen <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b> These antigens were also reactive with human alopecia areata antibodies. Some of the antibodies in both C 3 H/HeJ mice and humans with alopecia areata reacted to antigens of 44 and 46 kDa, which were identified as hair follicle–specific keratins. This study indicates that C 3 H/HeJ mice with hair loss have circulating antibodies to <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> similar to those present in humans with alopecia areata. These findings confirm that these mice are an appropriate model for human alopecia areata and support the hypothesis that alopecia areata results from an abnormal autoimmune response to <b>hair</b> <b>follicles...</b>|$|R

The patient’s history included eleven cases of internal urethrotomy, urethral catheter insertion, urethral dilatation, and lastly two urethroplasty procedures eighteen {{years prior to}} presentation at our clinic. Several <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> in the bulbous urethra and calculi causing partial obstruction were observed with urethrocystoscopy.

25|$|Microorganisms like Staphylococcus {{epidermidis}} colonize {{the skin}} surface. The density of skin flora depends on {{region of the}} skin. The disinfected skin surface gets recolonized from bacteria residing in the deeper areas of the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle,</b> gut and urogenital openings.|$|E
25|$|Another {{mechanism}} {{involves a}} change in the hair cycle. There are three stages of the hair cycle: the anagen phase (hair growth), the catagen phase (<b>hair</b> <b>follicle</b> death), and the telogen phase (hair shedding). If the anagen phase increases beyond what is normal; that region of the body will experience excessive hair growth.|$|E
25|$|Hedgehog {{signaling}} remains {{important in}} the adult.

40|$|The {{feasibility}} of targeting drugs to <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> {{by a combination}} of microencapsulation and iontophoresis has been evaluated. Minoxidil sulphate (MXS), which is used in the treatment of alopecia, was selected as a relevant drug with respect to follicular penetration. The skin permeation and disposition of MXS encapsulated in chitosan microparticles (MXS-MP) was evaluated in vitro after passive and iontophoretic delivery. Uptake of MXS was quantified at different exposure times in the stratum corneum (SC) and <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b> Microencapsulation resulted in increased (6 -fold) drug accumulation in the <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> relative to delivery from a simple MXS solution. Application of iontophoresis enhanced follicular delivery for both the solution and the microparticle formulations. It appears, therefore, that microencapsulation and iontophoresis can act synergistically to enhance topical drug targeting to <b>hair</b> <b>follicles...</b>|$|R
40|$|The <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> and {{the eyes}} of pallid mice (C 57 / 6 J-Pa/Pa) and those of black mice (C 57 / 6 J−+/Pa) were {{examined}} ultrastructurally, histochemically, and biochemically to {{determine the cause of}} pigment dilution. The pigment cells in the <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> {{and the eyes}} of pallid mice have less mature melanosomes than those of black mice. In the <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> the pallid melanosomes were transferred into keratinocytes and became aggregated. In the eyes they were already aggregated within the pigment cells and were digested in acid phosphatase-positive lysosomes. The activity of acid phosphatase, a marker of lysosomal enzymes, was significantly higher in pallid <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> and eyes than in black <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> and eyes. Dopa reactions at light and electron microscopical levels indicated that the pigment cells in each tissue produced a large amount of Dopa oxidase when compared with those in each black ocunterpart. However, the rate of hydroxylation of L-tyrosine– 3, 5 – 3 H was significantly lower in the pallid eyes than in black eyes, while this rate was significantly higher in pallid <b>hair</b> <b>follicles</b> than in black <b>hair</b> <b>follicles.</b> Immediate digestion of melanosomes within the pigment cells, i. e. autophagocytosis, seemed to explain the low activity in the pallid eyes. The diluted coat and eye colors of pallid mice are, therefore, not related to low Dopa oxidase activity but to immaturity of melanosomes and high activities of lysosomal enzymes; these enzymes seem to digest many of these immature melanosomes and contribute to the diluted coat and eye colors of pallid mice...|$|R

25|$|The Tanner scale {{looks at}} the {{development}} of pubic hair. Before the onset of puberty, the genital area of {{both boys and girls}} has very fine vellus hair (stage 1). At the onset of puberty, the body produces rising levels of the sex hormones, and in response, the skin of the genital area begins to produce thicker and rougher, often curlier, hair with a faster growth rate. The onset of pubic hair development is termed pubarche. The change for each <b>hair</b> <b>follicle</b> is relatively abrupt, but the extent of skin which grows androgenic hair gradually increases over several years.|$|E

25|$|The {{entire life}} cycle of D. folliculorum {{takes place in the}} time span of 18–24 days on its host. During the day, they feed on dead skin cells within hair follicles.

A female adult lays 20–24 eggs in a single hair follicle; as they grow they become tightly packed, and develop into larvae. The larva is then washed by a sebaceous flow, {{produced}} by the host’s sebaceous glands, into the mouth of the <b>hair</b> <b>follicle</b> where it matures into an adult.
