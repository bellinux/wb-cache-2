25|$|A double mini-trampoline {{competition}} {{consists of}} two types of pass. In the one, which {{is known as a}} mounter pass, the athlete performs one skill in the jump from the sloping end to the <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> and a second skill as they dismount from the <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> to the landing mat. In the second, which is known as a spotter pass, the athlete does a straight jump from the sloping end to the <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> to gain height, then after landing on the flat, performs the first skill, then after landing on the flat a second time, performs a second skill as they dismount. These skills are similar to those performed on a regular trampoline except that there is forward movement along the trampoline.|$|R

40|$|The {{characteristics}} of the temporal and spatial variation of the movable bed ina meandering channel were examined experimentally from an initial <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> to anequilibrium state. Maximum scouring occurs near the covex bank at the initialstage and the location moves upstream to the concave bank at the final equilibriumstage. Velocity distributions of main flow and secondary flow were measured in themeandering channels with <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> and equilibrium bed configuration. Two dimensional numerical model was applied for the prediction of velocity dis-tribution and bed variation. The results by the numerical model show fairly goodagreement with the measurements. Through the discussion on the results obtainedby the numerical model {{it was found that}} the phenomenon of the phase shift of themaximum scouring found in the experiment could be explained by the temporal in-crease of the secondary current from the inifial <b>flat</b> <b>bed</b> to the equilibrium stage...|$|R

50|$|Bolsters are baulks {{of timber}} fixed across the bed. The bed is thus not flat, but most loads such as girders, rails, timber lengths, signal posts etc are stiff {{enough that they}} only need to be {{supported}} at intervals, not continuously across a <b>flat</b> planked <b>bed.</b> The space between baulks allows room for tie-down chains or lifting strops, making this bolster design easier to work with than a completely <b>flat</b> <b>bed.</b>|$|R

40|$|A simple {{model is}} {{presented}} {{for the formation}} of rolling grain ripples on a <b>flat</b> sand <b>bed</b> by the oscillatory flow generated by a surface wave. An equation of motion is derived for the individual ripples, seen as "particles", on the otherwise <b>flat</b> <b>bed.</b> The model account for the initial apperance of the ripples, the subsequent coarsening of the ripples and the final equilibrium state. The model is related to physical parameters of the problem, and an analytical approximation for the equilibrium spacing of the ripples is developed. It is found that the spacing between the ripples scale with the square-root of the non-dimensional shear stress (the Shields parameter) on a <b>flat</b> <b>bed.</b> The results of the model are compared with measurements, and reasonable agreement between the model and the measurements is demonstrated.
