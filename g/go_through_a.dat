5|$|The egg stage lasts a {{few weeks}} in most butterflies, but eggs laid close to winter, {{especially}} in temperate regions, <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> diapause (resting) stage, and the hatching may take place only in spring.

5|$|The {{selection}} {{process for the}} IMO varies greatly by country. In some countries, especially those in east Asia, the {{selection process}} involves several tests of a difficulty comparable to the IMO itself. The Chinese contestants <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> camp. In others, such as the USA, possible participants <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of easier standalone competitions that gradually increase in difficulty. In the USA, the tests include the American Mathematics Competitions, the American Invitational Mathematics Examination, and the United States of America Mathematical Olympiad, {{each of which is}} a competition in its own right. For high scorers in the final competition for the team selection, there also is a summer camp, like that of China.|$|E

Against the Gentlemen of England at Lord's, Hassett made 200 not out against a team that featured eight Test players. He then made 103 against Somerset and 151 against the South of England. Australia won the first two and were denied by rain in the third.|$|E

5|$|Most fungi {{have both}} a haploid and a diploid stage {{in their life}} cycles. In sexually {{reproducing}} fungi, compatible individuals may combine by fusing their hyphae together into an interconnected network; this process, anastomosis, {{is required for the}} initiation of the sexual cycle. Many ascomycetes and basidiomycetes <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> dikaryotic stage, in which the nuclei inherited from the two parents do not combine immediately after cell fusion, but remain separate in the hyphal cells (see heterokaryosis).|$|E

Australia batted first against Kent and Morris made 43 {{in a total}} of 361 before Australia enforced the follow on and completed an innings victory. Morris was rested for the following three matches against the Gentlemen of England, Somerset and the South of England. The first two matches were won by innings while the third was washed out after Australia took a large first-innings lead. In the meantime, Morris underwent minor surgery for a split in his hand.|$|E

5|$|The {{life cycle}} of a termite begins with an egg, but is {{different}} from that of a bee or ant in that it goes through a developmental process called incomplete metamorphosis, with egg, nymph and adult stages. Nymphs resemble small adults, and <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of moults as they grow. In some species, eggs go through four moulting stages and nymphs go through three. Nymphs first moult into workers, and then some workers go through further moulting and become soldiers or alates; workers become alates only by moulting into alate nymphs.|$|E
5|$|There {{was some}} {{specific}} work {{required by the}} make-up department on Brent Spiner as during those flashbacks he was made to look younger which the team created by dying his hair darker and applying more youthful make-up. Also, the team added several different appliances to Kris Iyer to show his character <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> series of levels of infection {{of a number of}} diseases at the hands of Soong. These included colored contact lenses, prosthetics to make his veins appear to pulse and gel was added to his eyes to make them bloodshot.|$|E

Matthew Vaughn cast Jones, who he met producing the Guy Ritchie gangster movies where Jones begun his acting career. The actor had to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> four-hour make-up process to portray Juggernaut, which included a muscle suit and a prostethic chin.

5|$|Arsenal {{finished}} the league season {{without a single}} defeat and earned the tag of The Invincibles, a tag once given to the 1888–89 Preston North End team, the only previous team to <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> league season undefeated. Van Nistelrooy's missed penalty, therefore, was a crucial moment in Arsenal's season. The return fixture {{between the two sides}} at Highbury finished as a 1–1 draw and passed without incident. Manchester United finished in third place in the league table behind Chelsea but defeated Millwall in the 2004 FA Cup Final. Their run included a semi-final victory against Arsenal courtesy of a Paul Scholes goal. The following season, after Manchester United had brought Arsenal's unbeaten run to an end after 49 matches, the two clubs were involved in another incident at Old Trafford, variously dubbed the Battle of Old Trafford II, the Battle of the Buffet or simply the Battle of Old Trafford.|$|E

5|$|Diptera <b>go</b> <b>through</b> <b>a</b> {{complete}} metamorphosis with four distinct life stages – egg, larva, pupa and adult. In many flies, the larval stage {{is long and}} adults may have a short life. Most dipteran larvae develop in protected environments; many are aquatic and others are found in moist places such as carrion, fruit, vegetable matter, fungi and, {{in the case of}} parasitic species, inside their hosts. They tend to have thin cuticles and become desiccated if exposed to the air. Apart from the Brachycera, most dipteran larvae have sclerotinised head capsules, which may be reduced to remnant mouth hooks; the Brachycera, however, have soft, gelatinized head capsules from which the sclerites are reduced or missing. Many of these larvae retract their heads into their thorax.|$|E
