40|$|Ventricular arrhythmias and {{disturbed}} autonomic control, {{as reflected}} by abnormal {{heart rate variability}} (HRV), are related to hemodynamic impairment in chronic heart failure (CHF). We investigated the effects of orally (p. o.) administered <b>isomazole,</b> a new phosphodiesterase (PDE) inhibitor with calcium-sensitizing properties, on hemodynamics, ventricular arrhythmias, and HRV and examined a possible interaction between these parameters. Hemodynamic measurements and ambulatory ECG monitoring were performed in 12 patients with stable CHF class III-IV after single doses of <b>isomazole</b> 5 - 30 mg. Pulmonary wedge pressure decreased after 5, 10, 20, and 30 mg, but cardiac output, (CO) increased only after the higher doses [20 mg, + 20 %(p = 0. 031) ] of <b>isomazole.</b> KR did not change. Mean arterial and pulmonary artery pressure, (MAP, PAP) decreased significantly in the 10 -and 20 -mg groups [10 mg, - 6 %(p = 0. 035) and - 14 %(p < 0. 001) respectively; 20 mg, - 13 %(p = 0. 047) and - 31 %(p = 0. 006), respectively]. <b>Isomazole</b> did not exert {{a significant effect on}} ventricular arrhythmias in the subsequent 24 h after acute dosing. Analysis of HRV showed that rMSSD and pNN 50 (parameters of vagal tone) tended to increase after <b>isomazole</b> administration. Normalized high-frequency power during the day increased from 17. 4 to 22. 3 nu (p < 0. 05), whereas low frequency tended to decrease from 52. 7 to 48. 2 nu (p = 0. 06). Acute <b>isomazole</b> administration improves hemodynamics but has no effect on ventricular arrhythmias. The HRV variability data suggest development of an increase in vagal control of KR, parallel to the acute hemodynamic improvement after <b>isomazole.</b> Withdrawal of vagal control of HR in CHF may be a reversible process...|$|E
