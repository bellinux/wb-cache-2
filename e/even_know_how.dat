Meg notices that her birthday party is kiddie-type, with games such as Pin the Tail on the Donkey.|$|E
5|$|Second, Giáp made {{a mistake}} in Nà Sản by {{committing}} his forces to reckless frontal attacks before being fully prepared. He learned his lesson: at Điện Biên Phủ, Giáp spent months meticulously stockpiling ammunition and emplacing heavy artillery and antiaircraft guns before making his move. Teams of Viet Minh volunteers were sent into the French camp to scout the disposition of the French artillery. Wooden artillery pieces were built as decoys and the real guns were rotated every few salvos to confuse French counterbattery fire. As a result, when the battle finally began, the Viet Minh knew exactly where the French artillery pieces were, while the French did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> many guns Giáp possessed.|$|E

5|$|Jussi {{found himself}} in the unusual {{position}} of attempting to defend a client who refused to defend himself. With no evidence at his disposal to support Feletti's testimony, he was forced to rely almost entirely on his own oratory. Jussi put forward some aspects of the sequence of events that he said suggested that orders had indeed come from Rome—for example, that Feletti had sent Edgardo straight off to the capital without seeing him—and asserted that the Holy Office and the Pope were far better placed to adjudge the validity of the baptism than a secular court. He quoted at length from Angelo Padovani's account of his meeting with Anna Morisi in July 1858, then cast doubt on the grocer Lepori's claim that he did not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to baptise a child—Jussi produced a police report in which Lepori was described as a close friend of a Jesuit priest. Jussi proposed that Lepori and Bussolari might both be lying to protect themselves, and that Morisi's sexual impropriety did not necessarily mean her story was false. He concluded that since Feletti had been inquisitor at the time, he had merely done what that office required him to do, and no crime had been committed.|$|E
500|$|When Diane first played me {{what she}} had begun with the song, I needed no convincing about the record... it was about sharing that part of myself with the world... We {{talked a lot about}} what I felt the song needed in order to reach as many young people as possible. I felt that it needed to not stay in a purely {{emotional}} state, but {{that it was going to}} somehow grow throughout the performance and the song and by the end, kind of be full of rage. I feel like what this song accomplishes is women—or men—rising to say, 'You think you can hurt me? You don't know about power. Because after what you did to me, you don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> much stronger I am.' ...|$|E
500|$|Stefani {{initially}} did {{not intend}} to tour to support the album, responding [...] "What tour?" [...] to a question from MTV News in December 2004 regarding a possible tour. She later mentioned several times that she had not originally intended to tour in support of the album, referring to her [...] "illegal tour" [...] and apologizing for her breaking her promise not to tour on stage at the Xcel Energy Center in Saint Paul, Minnesota on November 14 and admitting [...] "I just wanted to make a record. I didn't want to tour, I was too tired, then you guys kept buying the record, and I had to come out and see you guys" [...] on stage at Winnipeg on November 16. In a September interview with MTV News, Stefani said of the tour: [...] "I'm looking forward to it, it's going to be unbelievable.

500|$|According to Woolverton, {{the story}} team {{challenged}} nearly every line of dialogue Woolverton suggested for the character. On one occasion, the story artists re-wrote what Woolverton had originally scripted as Belle using a map to indicate places {{to where she}} would like to travel to the character baking a cake. Arguing that the liberated Belle would not <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to bake, Woolverton decided to compromise by having the character read a book instead, which was similarly debated because some filmmakers considered reading to be too passive an activity. To resolve this, Woolverton scripted Belle walk while reading, an activity in which Woolverton herself partook as a child. In Beaumont's fairy tale, Belle is essentially forced to replace her father as the Beast's prisoner. To make the character more independent, Woolverton re-wrote her so that she willingly ventures into the woods in search of her father, bravely confronts the Beast and ultimately trades her own freedom in return for Maurice's instead. During Gaston's climactic fight with the Beast, the character's line [...] "Time to die!" [...] was changed to [...] "Belle is mine!" [...] in order to return the focus of the story to Belle.|$|E
500|$|At the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign {{she belonged}} to Kappa Kappa Gamma {{sorority}} where she befriended a beautiful older sorority sister, [...] "the prettiest I had ever seen", quite popular {{with men and}} with women. Bannon witnessed a younger sorority sister's unabashed infatuation with the older sister. She recalls it was an awkward situation, even though the older sorority sister was [...] "unfailingly gracious" [...] to the younger one. In recognizing the younger woman's attractions, she began to suspect her own sexuality. She said, [...] "I {{saw a lot of}} it happening and I didn't {{know what to make of}} it. I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to put it—I was absolutely consumed with it, it was an extraordinary thing." [...] Another sorority sister was physically remarkable, very tall—almost , with a husky voice and boyish nickname, that Bannon imagined was a blend of Johnny Weissmuller and Ingrid Bergman. She recalled entering the communal restroom and seeing the sister, [...] "both of us in underwear, and experienc(ing) a sort of electric shock", and trying not to stare at her. In 1954, she graduated with a degree in French and soon married an engineer whose job made them relocate frequently.|$|E
500|$|Pete Wentz {{was once}} again the primary lyricist of the band during the {{production}} of the album. Stump said that Wentz [...] "totally outdid himself on this record. He doesn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> good his lyrics are here." [...] Wentz, despite many recent personal developments (marriage to Ashlee Simpson, birth of his son, Bronx), desired to shift the focus away from himself and turn it outward onto the world. For the first time on a Fall Out Boy album, Folie is rarely autobiographical, as the band believed the format was [...] "losing its luster" [...] because [...] "everyone was doing it." [...] The songs on the album explore decaying relationships, moral dilemmas, and societal shortcomings, as well as concepts such as trust, infidelity, responsibility, and commitment. Stump tagged Folie à Deux as a [...] "message record" [...] that takes aim at [...] "the materialistic dance between any two parties obsessed with each other, whether it's teenage girls and handbag makers, politicians and lobbyists or tabloids and stars." [...] Folie à Deux also dissects how self-motivated American culture is, and many of the lyrics are intended to be satirical. While the album does contain political overtones, the band wanted to avoid being overt about these themes, leaving many lyrics open to interpretation for listeners.|$|E

500|$|Following {{the release}} of Selena's third studio album Entre a Mi Mundo and the launch of a {{clothing}} boutique in 1993, the singer and her band began working on Amor Prohibido. Having achieved the success and the fan base that EMI Latin's president Jose Behar was seeking, {{he wanted to take}} advantage of [...] "newly discovered markets". The singer's brother, A.B. Quintanilla, felt it was important that the music he produced for Selena remain [...] "fresh". EMI Latin had insisted on a Grammy Award-winning producer to work with Selena on the album. A.B. later told BuzzFeed how he had to [...] "outdo" [...] himself to remain her principal record producer. Owing to Entre a Mi Mundos commercial success, and its career-launching single [...] "Como la Flor", A.B. found it [...] "difficult" [...] to produce another successful recording. In a 2002 interview he said that writing [...] "a part two" [...] to [...] "Como la Flor" [...] was infeasible so he enlisted Selena y Los Dinos band members Pete Astudillo and Ricky Vela to help with the album's writing process. The result was a [...] "more mature sound [...] " [...] that included experimental recording and production. It was the final album with any production and songwriting assistance by Astudillo, as he parted with Los Dinos to pursue a solo career. The entire production of Amor Prohibido lasted six months beginning on September 17, 1993. It took two weeks for the band to complete its post-production before the album was given a street date of March 13, 1994. Vela noticed the band was becoming stagnant and had to rush the production because of an approaching deadline. Selena's husband and guitarist Chris Pérez, wrote that the constant touring demands and the opening of the boutiques depleted time spent creating Amor Prohibido, saying [...] "I don't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> we managed to find time to make the next album." [...] Vela {{said in an interview that}} it was common for the band to arrange the sequencing of the entire project in their homes before going into the studio to record the songs.|$|E

2500|$|Gable's {{marriage}} in 1939 to his third wife, actress Carole Lombard (1908–1942), was the happiest period {{of his personal}} life. They met while filming 1932's No Man of Her Own, when Lombard was still married to actor William Powell, but their romance did not take off until 1936. They became reacquainted at a party and soon were inseparable, cited in fan magazines and tabloids as an official couple. Gable thrived being around Lombard's youthful, charming, and frank personality, once stating, [...] "You can trust that little screwball with your life or your hopes or your weaknesses, and she wouldn't <b>even</b> <b>know</b> <b>how</b> to think about letting you down." [...] Lombard, for her part, seemed to gain personal stability and a contented home life that she had previously lacked. She taught herself how to hunt and fish and accompanied Gable on trips with his hunting companions.|$|E
