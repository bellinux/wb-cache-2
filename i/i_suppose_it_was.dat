500|$|Although Swift found Motte {{willing to}} print the work, {{he was not}} willing to print Swift's {{additional}} scene. Swift's lack of control over the publication lead to Swift complaining of [...] "mangled and murdered Pages". This was one of many reasons that Swift turned from Motte as his printer and sought a printer willing to produce his complete works without content removal. On 9 October 1733, Swift wrote: [...] "Now, you may please to remember how much I complained of Motts suffering some friend of his (<b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> Mr Took a Clergy-man now dead) not onely to blot out some things that he thought might give offence, but to insert a good deal of trash contrary to the Author's manner and Style, and Intention." ...|$|E
500|$|Critical {{reception}} of The Secret Service has been mostly negative. Gerry Anderson, however, {{said that it}} was his favourite of all the series that he had produced. Leo Eaton, who directed four episodes, has referred to The Secret Service as [...] "just a bit weird" [...] and questioned the effectiveness of Unwin's humour. Production manager Desmond Saunders' verdict was [...] "strange. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the gobbledegook and the mixture of live action with puppets. It never {{seemed to me to be}} a very good idea." [...] In discussing the production of the series on the website TVCentury21.com, Simon Wickes judges the premise [...] "very strange", and suggests that The Secret Service was made first and foremost to bridge the Andersons' Supermarionation series and their subsequent efforts in live action. Kif Bowden-Smith of the Transdiffusion website concurs with this latter point, describing the mix of puppetry and live action as [...] "an experimental format for the following live-action series".|$|E

About his early training {{to become a}} priest, {{he said in an}} interview, [...] "I spent five years in the seminary and <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> assumed that one had a vocation. I realised subsequently that I didn't." [...] He attended University College Dublin, where he studied archaeology and linguistics, becoming proficient in Irish.|$|E

Well, yes, my dear: <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>is,</b> <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>is.</b> (She nods sympathetically.) I'm afraid I'm sometimes a little irritable; but I know what's right and reasonable all the time, even when I don't act on it. Can you believe that? ...|$|R

2500|$|... "During {{these two}} years I {{was led to}} think much about religion. Whilst on board the Beagle I was quite orthodox, & I {{remember}} being heartily laughed at by several of the officers (though themselves orthodox) for quoting the Bible as an unanswerable authority on some point of morality. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> the novelty of the argument that amused them. But I had gradually come, by this time, {{to see that the}} Old Testament from its manifestly false history of the world, with the Tower of Babel, rainbow as a sign, etc., etc., and from its attributing to God the feelings of a revengeful tyrant, was no more to be trusted than the sacred books of the Hindoos, or the beliefs of any barbarian." ...|$|E
2500|$|From 1989 to 1990, Coupland {{lived in}} the Mojave Desert working on a {{handbook}} about the birth cohort that followed the Baby Boom. He received a $22,500 advance from St. Martin's Press to write the nonfiction handbook. Instead, Coupland wrote a novel, [...] It was rejected in Canada before being accepted by an American publishing house in 1991. Reflecting on the writing of his debut novel years later, Coupland said, [...] "I remember spending my days almost dizzy with loneliness and feeling like I'd sold the family cow for three beans. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> this crippling loneliness that gave Gen X its bite. I was trying to imagine a life for myself on paper that certainly wasn't happening in reality." ...|$|E
2500|$|After {{developing}} [...] "a random obsession" [...] with Fine Gael leader Enda Kenny, {{she took}} the morning off school during her Junior Certificate mock examinations and met the future Taoiseach as he campaigned in Millstreet ahead of the 2011 general election. Their meeting was filmed for television, with Kenny vowing he would not reduce disability funding if elected. O'Riordan later remarked, [...] "I thought he was honest. He looked like someone who wasn't {{going to tell a}} lie." [...] Upon election he cut disability funding and O'Riordan wrote a letter expressing her disappointment. Her public confrontation with Enda Kenny over his spending cuts to disability funding contributed to O'Riordan's rise to fame; the government later changed its mind. She later explained: [...] "I thought Enda Kenny was a cool guy, you know, he always seemed really relaxed, and easy going. So I only went up for a picture and one of our local people from home was like ‘why don't you ask him about people with disabilities’, so I did and the local television were recording because it was a big thing for Millstreet, our Future Taoiseach coming. <b>I</b> <b>suppose</b> <b>it</b> <b>was</b> one really small thing that you just do and it just turned into a big thing." ...|$|E
