50|$|Scholastic wrestling is {{regulated}} by the National Federation of State High School Associations (NFHS). Each state high school association has adopted its wrestling rules, with each making some modifications. Every high school is expected to practice wrestling at two levels: varsity and junior varsity, although wrestling at the freshmen (ninth grade) level is becoming more widespread. The NFHS generally sets the standard for weight classes for high school-level dual meets, multiple duals, and tournaments. In most states, high school wrestlers can compete at 14 different weight classes, ranging from 106 lb to the Heavyweight division of up to 285 lb. Other states have additional or modified weight classes such as the 96 lb weight class in states such as New York, the 98 lb and 105 lb weight classes in states such as Montana, and the 180 lb weight class in states such as Texas. Weight classes for junior varsity, freshman, and middle school teams may differ from state to state. Each state high school association that sanctions wrestling also has a defined weight-control plan that prohibits excessive weight loss and dehydration during the season. The plan would include at least a minimum 7 percent body fat for males and 12 percent body fat for females. These weight control plans include provisions for weight assessment by the school's athletics medical staff, and certification of the lowest allowable weight class with the team's head coach and the person that performs the weight assessment. Often, this is done online through the website of the state high school association or the National Wrestling Coaches Association (NWCA). After the date of certification, a <b>growth</b> <b>allowance</b> of two pounds in each weight class may be allowed in some states. Many tournaments offer an allowance {{of one or two}} pounds, allowing wrestlers to compete in a certain class if they are within the allowance of making the weight limit for that class.

40|$|When {{the first}} human {{visitors}} on Mars prepare to return to Earth, {{they will have to}} comply with stringent planetary protection requirements. Apollo Program experience warns that opening an EVA hatch directly to the surface will bring dust into the ascent vehicle. To prevent inadvertent return of potential Martian contaminants to Earth, careful consideration must be given {{to the way in which}} crew ingress their Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV). For architectures involving more than one surface element-such as an ascent vehicle and a pressurized rover or surface habitat-a retractable tunnel that eliminates extravehicular activity (EVA) ingress is an attractive solution. Beyond addressing the immediate MAV access issue, a reusable tunnel may be useful for other surface applications, such as rover to habitat transfer, once its primary mission is complete. A National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) team is studying the optimal balance between surface tunnel functionality, mass, and stowed volume as part of the Evolvable Mars Campaign (EMC). The study team began by identifying the minimum set of functional requirements needed for the tunnel to perform its primary mission, as this would presumably be the simplest design, with the lowest mass and volume. This Minimum Functional Tunnel then becomes a baseline against which various tunnel design concepts and potential alternatives can be traded, and aids in assessing the mass penalty of increased functionality. Preliminary analysis indicates that the mass of a single-mission tunnel is about 237 kg, not including mass <b>growth</b> <b>allowance...</b>|$|E
40|$|A multi-discipline team {{of experts}} from the National Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA) {{developed}} Mars surface power system point design solutions for two conceptual missions to Mars using In-situ resource utilization (ISRU). The primary goal {{of this study was}} to compare the relative merits of solar- versus fission-powered versions of each surface mission. First, the team compared three different solar-power options against a fission power system concept for a sub-scale, uncrewed demonstration mission. This pathfinder design utilized a 4. 5 meter diameter lander. Its primary mission would be to demonstrate Mars entry, descent, and landing techniques. Once on the Martian surface, the landers ISRU payload would demonstrate liquid oxygen propellant production from atmospheric resources. For the purpose of this exercise, location was assumed to be at the Martian equator. The three solar concepts considered included a system that only operated during daylight hours (at roughly half the daily propellant production rate of a round-the-clock fission design), a battery-augmented system that operated through the night (matching the fission concepts propellant production rate), and a system that operated only during daylight, but at a higher rate (again, matching the fission concepts propellant production rate).

40|$|Mars Sample Return (MSR) is {{the highest}} {{priority}} science mission {{for the next decade}} as recommended by the recent Decadal Survey of Planetary Science. This paper presents an overview of a feasibility study for a MSR mission. The objective {{of the study was to}} determine whether emerging commercial capabilities can be used to reduce the number of mission systems and launches required to return the samples, with the goal of reducing mission cost. The major element required for the MSR mission are described and include an integration of the emerging commercial capabilities with small spacecraft design techniques; new utilizations of traditional aerospace technologies; and recent technological developments. We report the feasibility of a complete and closed MSR mission design using the following scenario that covers three synodic launch opportunities, beginning with the 2022 opportunity: A Falcon Heavy injects a SpaceX Red Dragon capsule and trunk onto a Trans Mars Injection (TMI) trajectory. The capsule is modified to carry all the hardware needed to return samples collected on Mars including a Mars Ascent Vehicle (MAV); an Earth Return Vehicle (ERV); and hardware to transfer a sample collected in a previously landed rover mission to the ERV. The Red Dragon descends to land on the surface of Mars using Supersonic Retro Propulsion (SRP). After previously collected samples are transferred to the ERV, the single-stage MAV launches the ERV from the surface of Mars to a Mars phasing orbit. The MAV uses a storable liquid, pump fed bi-propellant propulsion system. After a brief phasing period, the ERV, which also uses a storable bi-propellant system, performs a Trans Earth Injection (TEI) burn. Once near Earth the ERV performs Earth and lunar swing-bys and is placed into a Lunar Trailing Orbit (LTO 0 - an Earth orbit, at lunar distance. A later mission, using a Dragon and launched by a Falcon Heavy, performs a rendezvous with the ERV in the lunar trailing orbit, retrieves the sample container and breaks the chain of contact with Mars by transferring the sample into a sterile and secure container. With the sample contained, the retrieving spacecraft, makes a controlled Earth re-entry preventing any unintended release of pristine Martian materials into the Earth's biosphere. Other capsule type vehicles and associated launchers may be applicable. The analysis methods employed standard and specialized aerospace engineering tools. Mission system elements were analyzed with either direct techniques or by using parametric mass estimating relationships (MERs). The architecture was iterated until overall mission convergence was achieved on at least one path. Subsystems analyzed in this study include support structures, power system, nose fairing, thermal insulation, actuation devices, MAV exhaust venting, and GN&C. Best practice application of loads, mass growth contingencies, and resource margins were used. For Falcon Heavy capabilities and Dragon subsystems we utilized publically available data from SpaceX; published analyses from other sources; as well as our own engineering and aerodynamic estimates. Earth Launch mass is under 11 mt, which is within the estimated capability of a Falcon Heavy, with margin. Total entry masses between 7 and 10 mt were considered with closure occurring between 9 and 10 mt. Propellant mass fractions for each major phase of the EDL - Entry, Terminal Descent, and Hazard Avoidance - have been derived. An assessment of the entry conditions on the thermal protection system (TPS), currently in use for Dragon missions, has been made. And shows no significant stressors. A useful mass of 2. 0 mt is provided and includes mass <b>growth</b> <b>allowances</b> for the MAV, the ERV, and mission unique equipment. We also report on alternate propellant options for the MAV and options for the ERV, including propulsion systems; crewed versus robotic retrieval mission; as well as direct Earth entry. International Planetary Protection Policies as well as verifiable means of compliance will have a large impact on any MSR mission design. We identify areas within our architecture where such impacts occur. This work shows that emerging commercial capabilities can be used to effectively integrated into a mission to achieve an important planetary science objective...|$|R
40|$|The aim of {{this paper}} is to shed light on the idea of demand-led growth and in {{particular}} debate of the last two decades on the appropriate direction of non-marginalist growth theory by exploring the relation between growth and autonomous demands in a fixed capital model proper. The paper developes a simplified two sector model producing a pure consumption good and a machine with variable efficiency. A "fixed-price" model is considered whereby relative prices and the real wage are held at their long-period equilibrium levels, so that disequilibrium in the model is limited to quantities. The dynamics of quantities are represented in terms of first order difference equation system in growth rates of demand, investment growth rates, utilization rates and the relative size of the two sectors. While the local stability of the steady state can be considered in terms of the characteristics of the relevant Jacobian for the model in question such analysis is largely inconclusive. Attention is instead focused on the results of dynamic simulation of the model. These latter results, show the dynamics to depend crucially on the assumptions made regarding the formation of producers' expectations about future growth in demand. Most importantly, expectations of future <b>growth</b> which make <b>allowance</b> for dispersion in past growth rates; as well as expectations which are partially dependent on expectations about autonomous demand growth may have a significant stabilizing effect on the growth of the economy. ...|$|R

Including 30 % mass <b>growth</b> <b>allowance,</b> total payload masses for the three solar concepts ranged from 1, 116 to 2, 396 kg, versus the 2, 686 kg fission power scheme. However, solar power masses are expected to approach or exceed the fission payload mass at landing sites further from the equator, making landing site selection a key driver in the final power system decision. The team also noted that detailed reliability analysis should be performed on daytime-only solar power schemes to assess potential issues with frequent ISRU system on/off cycling. Next, the team developed a solar-powered point design solution for a conceptual four-crew, 500 -day surface mission consisting of up to four landers per crewed expedition mission. Unlike the demonstration mission, a lengthy power outage due to the global dust storms that are known to occur on Mars would pose a safety hazard to a crewed mission. A similar fission versus solar power trade study performed by NASA in 2007 concluded that fission power was more reliable-with a much lower mass penalty-than solar power for this application. However, recent advances in solar cell and energy storage technologies and changes in operational assumptions prompted NASA to revisit the analysis. For the purpose of this exercise a particular landing site at Jezero Crater, located at 18 o north latitude, was assumed. A fission power system consisting of four each 10 kW Kilopower fission reactors was compared to a distributed network of Orion-derived Ultraflex solar arrays and Lithium ion batteries mounted on every lander. The team found that a solar power system mass of about 9, 800 kg would provide the 22 kilowatts (kW) keep-alive power needed to survive a dust storm lasting up to 120 -days at average optical depth of 5, and 35 kW peak power for normal operations under clear skies. Although this is less than half the mass estimated during the 2007 work (which assumed latitudes up to 30 o) it is still more than the 7, 000 kg mass of the fission system which provides full power regardless of dust storm conditions...|$|E

A digestibility and nitrogen balance trial was carried out in a 4 x 4 Latin square arrangement. Four growing Mukota pigs with an average weight of 10 kg were fed each diet for seven days for adaptation. Weight, urine and faecal samples were collected for 7 days after the adaptation period. Results showed that pig and dietary treatment had an effect on pig weight gain (P 0. 05). Week and pig had no effect on dry matter digestibility, nitrogen and feed intake (P> 0. 05) while dietary treatment had an effect (P< 0. 05). In relation to nitrogen retained as a percentage of nitrogen digested only the treatment had no effect showing that all diets including the one with Commelina benghalensis and a low level of energy (0. 11 MJ ME/kgW 0. 75) can be fed without affecting the performance of growing Mukota pigs. None of the variables, however, had an effect on the feed conversion ratio. In the second trial the objective {{of the study was to}} evaluate the effect of supplementation of growing Mukota pigs with a commercial growersâ€™ diet on farm. Ten farmers supplemented their animals with a commercial growersâ€™ diet at 300 g per pig per day while a further three acted as controls. All groups of animals were allowed to forage freely for the duration of the trial. The ii supplemented animals showed improved rate of weight gains than the control. There was a decline in the rate of gain in the rainy season due to the penning of the animals leading to a decline in the supply of feed.
