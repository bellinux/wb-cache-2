40|$|Building Information Modelling (<b>BIM)</b> <b>is</b> {{a process}} {{involving}} {{the creation and}} management of objective data with property, unique identity and relationship. In the Architecture, Engineering and Construction (AEC) industry, <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> adopted {{a lot in the}} lifecycle of buildings because of the high integration of information that it enables. Four-dimensional (4 D) computer-aided design (CAD) has been adopted for many years to improve the construction planning process. <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> adopted throughout buildings' lifecycles, in design, construction and operation. This paper presents five large-scale public and financial projects that adopt BIM in the design, construction and operational phases.

40|$|Abstract: Hand-drafted print, {{sketching}} {{and hand}} modeling were the standard   for building designs {{before the advent}} of computer aided design (CAD) systems. Nowadays CAD systems are better understood, their adoption increased until the 2 D, 3 D CAD system   and the virtual reality became the norm. Their natural evolution has given rise to a new and more complex generation of building design tools known as building information modeling, or <b>BIM.</b> There <b>is</b> insufficient clarity about what <b>BIM</b> <b>is,</b> although this is improving, and there is much shared understanding. There <b>is</b> agreement that <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> not just software. <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> not just CAD, or geometric data. <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> a collaboratively generated and maintained, data rich, information source {{for the life of the}} design process and beyond.

40|$|Impaired {{apoptosis}} is {{now recognized}} to be central to tumor development. Bcl 2, activated by chromosomal translocation in human follicular lymphoma, promotes oncogenesis by inhibiting apoptosis. Bim, a distant proapoptotic relative, {{is emerging as}} a major physiologic antagonist of Bcl 2. Here, we show that loss of <b>Bim</b> <b>is</b> oncogenic. <b>Bim</b> protein levels <b>were</b> elevated in the apoptosis-prone B lymphoid cells of Eμ-Myc-transgenic mice, and Bim-mutant Eμ-Myc mice had increased numbers of IgM-bearing B cells. Eμ-Myc-expressing B lymphoid cells deficient in <b>Bim</b> <b>were</b> refractory to apoptosis induced in vitro by cytokine deprivation or antigen receptor cross-linking. Thus, <b>Bim</b> <b>is</b> induced by Myc in B cells and mediates apoptosis. Remarkably, inactivation of even a single allele of Bim accelerated Myc-induced development of tumors, particularly acute B cell leukemia. None of the primary tumors from Bim+/- Eμ-Myc mice displayed loss of the second allele of Bim. These findings indicate that <b>Bim</b> <b>is</b> a tumor suppressor, at least in B lymphocytes, and is haploinsufficient. Whereas the p 19 Arf/p 53 pathway is frequently mutated in tumors arising in Bim+/+ Eμ-Myc mice, it was unaffected in most Bim-deficient tumors, indicating that <b>Bim</b> reduction <b>is</b> an effective alternative to loss of p 53 function...|$|R

40|$|The {{construction}} industry {{in recent years}} has incorporated information technology which serves to facilitate the conceptualization and realization of construction projects. These efforts have culminated in the development of “Building Information Modeling ” (BIM), a process consisting of generating and managing digital renderings of a building‟s functional and physical features. BIM has attracted widespread popularity recently; however, there is several challenges concerning its definitions and expectations in early phases of construction projects. Evidently different organizations and people create their own definitions of BIM, based on the specific way they work with <b>BIM.</b> Thus, it <b>is</b> evident that there are differences in the way <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> perceived by both different individuals and organizations within the {{construction industry}}. As a result, it might be difficult {{to come up with a}} common definition of BIM for the entire construction industry. In other words, there is confusion concerning what <b>BIM</b> <b>is,</b> and what <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> not. This can lead to misunderstandings concerning expectations from different stakeholders involved in construction projects where <b>BIM</b> <b>is</b> utilized. Therefore, by reviewing and analyzing current literature in the area of BIM, the main objective of this paper is to discuss the most common challenges of BIM‟s definitions and expectations which hinder the comprehensive realization of its benefits in order to increase the awareness of construction practitioners and firms. It is suggested that the definition of <b>BIM</b> should not <b>be</b> unilateral but rather encompass several key characteristics which have been attributed to it...|$|R

40|$|Building Information Modeling {{is a term}} {{representing}} a new process or approach that is being widely implemented in the architecture, engineering and construction industry. If one works in this industry and has not yet heard the term, {{it is reasonable to}} expect it will not be the case much longer.

40|$|Part 11 : Special Session: BIMInternational audienceBuilding Information Modeling (<b>BIM)</b> <b>is</b> {{a process}} by which a digital {{representation}} of the physical and functional characteristics of a facility are built, analyzed, documented and assessed virtually, then revised iteratively until the optimal model is documented.

40|$|The AEC-industry {{has been}} lagging behind {{other types of}} {{production}} industries in terms of productivity development for the last 40 years. The reason for this {{has been described as}} to be a combination of the collaborative needs in performing construction projects combined with the fragmented nature of the AEC-industry. Building information modelling (<b>BIM)</b> has <b>been</b> presented as a way of addressing these issues and thereby improving productivity in construction projects. The adoption of <b>BIM</b> has <b>been</b> slow and many barriers hindering widespread adoption of this technology have been revealed. There are however no single barrier that could be solved individually in order to enable more extensive BIM adoption. These barriers are hindering many different aspects of effective adoption of BIM.
