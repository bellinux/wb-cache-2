50|$|A stye, {{also known}} as a <b>hordeolum,</b> is an {{infection}} of an oil gland in the eyelid. This results in a red tender bump {{at the edge of the}} eyelid. The outside or the inside of the eyelid can be affected.|$|E
5000|$|<b>Hordeolum</b> (stye) is an {{infection}} of the sebaceous glands of Zeis usually caused by Staphylococcus aureus bacteria, similar to the more common condition Acne vulgaris. It is characterized by an acute onset of symptoms {{and it looks like}} a red bump placed underneath the eyelid. The main symptoms of styes include pain, redness of the eyelid and sometimes swollen eyelids. Styes usually disappear within a week without treatment. Otherwise, antibiotics may be prescribed and home remedies such as warm water compresses may be used to promote faster healing. Styes are normally harmless and do not cause long lasting damage.|$|E
40|$|The {{presented}} {{pilot study}} compared {{the effectiveness of}} combined antibiotic ophthalmic solution (neomycin sulfate, polymyxin B sulfate and gramicidin) with a placebo (artificial tear) {{in the treatment of}} <b>hordeolum</b> after incision and curettage (I&C). A randomized, placebo-controlled trial with patients and investigators blinded from the start started from June 2002 to May 2003. Subjects were patients with untreated <b>hordeolum</b> who subsequently underwent I&C at the Ophthalmology Department. The patients were randomized into 2 groups: group A for combined antibiotic ophthalmic solution, and group B for artificial tear containing the antibiotic solution base. Pain score, mass size and duration of cure were recorded before and on the 3 rd and 7 th day after treatment. The study included 14 patients in each group. Two subjects in group A and three subjects in group B dropped out. There were no statistically significant differences of all outcomes in both groups, even with the intention-to-treat analysis. The conclusion is combined antibiotic ophthalmic solution is not more effective than placebo in the treatment of <b>hordeolum</b> after I&C...|$|E
40|$|Purpose: Ocular {{perforation}} during lid anesthesia {{is rarely}} reported. We describe here {{a case of}} inadvertent corneal perforation and traumatic cataract that occurred during lid anesthesia in a procedure for <b>hordeolum</b> removal. Methods: A 33 -year-old woman presented with a sudden visual loss of her left eye. She had undergone <b>hordeolum</b> removal the day before at a local clinic. On ophthalmologic examination, the cornea was perforated and the lens cortex was extruded into the anterior chamber. After cataract removal and IOL implantation, antibiotics were injected into the vitreous. Results: Her final visual acuity of the left eye was 20 / 20. Postoperative specular microscopic examination revealed a normal-range endothelial cell count, coefficient of variation, and hexagonality despite the intracameral lidocaine injection. Conclusions: Anesthetic injection of an infected lid {{should be done with}} great caution. Although there are possibilities of corneal endothelial toxicity and endophthalmitis in case of intracameral lidocaine injection through the infected lid, yet proper management may save the patient’s vision without complications.

40|$|Objectives: To {{investigate}} the tear film osmolarity in eyes with chronic blepharitis. Materials and Methods: Patients with symptomatic chronic blepharitis {{were included in}} the study. After ophthalmologic examination, tear osmolarity was measured. Tear film breakup time (TBUT), Schirmer II test with anesthesia, and slit-lamp corneal fluorescein staining were also performed. The tear film osmolarity results were compared with those of healthy subjects. Results: Ten eyes of 10 patients (6 women, 2 men) {{with a mean age of}} 47. 4 ± 14. 4 years (31 to 62 years) and 12 eyes of 12 healthy individuals (10 women, 2 men) were examined. Patients’ symptoms included foreign body sensation, photophobia, redness, burning, itching, scaling, eyelash loss, and recurrent <b>hordeolum.</b> There was no any other systemic or ocular pathology that could result in dry eye. Mean osmolarity was 323. 8 ± 19. 91 mOsm/L (298 - 365 mOsm/L), mean TBUT was 4. 22 ± 2. 17 seconds (1 - 8 secs,), and mean Schirmer measurement was 7. 2 ± 3. 26 mm (4 - 15 mm).

40|$|Purpose. The aim of {{this study}} was to {{investigate}} the relationships between MGL and ocular symptoms, several systemic conditions, and key markers of ocular surface health. Methods. We included into the study 91 healthy volunteers between the ages of 20 and 77 years. We analyzed meibomian gland morphology, function, and lid margin alterations. We correlated our findings with self-reported ocular symptoms, systemic medical history, lifestyle factors, and tear film abnormalities. Results. We observed that a high ocular surface disease index, a history of either chalazion or <b>hordeolum,</b> experience of puffy eyelids upon waking, and foreign body sensation all appeared to be predictors of an abnormal meiboscore after adjusting for age and sex (p= 0. 0007; p= 0. 001; p= 0. 02; p= 0. 001, resp.). Multivariate logistic regression model including age and sex showed that there were three independent predictors of abnormal meiboscore: older age (OR = 1. 03, 95 % CI = 1. 01 – 1. 04 per year, p= 0. 006), postmenopausal hormone therapy (OR = 4. 98, 95 % CI = 1. 52 – 16. 30, p= 0. 007), and the use of antiallergy drugs (OR = 5. 85, 95 % CI = 2. 18 – 15. 72, p= 0. 0004).

40|$|Background / Aims: The eye may be {{infected}} from external sources or through intra-ocular invasion of micro-organisms {{carried by the}} blood stream. This study was undertaken to isolate and identify the specific bacterial pathogens causing ocular infections and to determine their in-vitro antibacterial susceptibilities to commonly used antibacterial agents. Materials and Methods: A retrospective analysis of all patients with clinically diagnosed bacterial ocular infections such as blepharitis, conjunctivitis, internal and external <b>hordeolum,</b> suppurative scleritis, canaliculitis, keratitis, dacryocystitis, preseptal cellulitis, endophthalmitis and panophthalmitis presenting between January 2005 and December 2005 was performed. Extra-ocular and intra-ocular specimens were collected and were subjected to direct microscopy and culture. Results: A total of 756 patients with bacterial ocular infections were analyzed, of which 462 (61 &#x 0025;) eyes had adnexal bacterial infection, 217 (28. 7 &#x 0025;) had corneal infection, 6 (0. 8 &#x 0025;) had scleral involvement and the remaining 71 (9. 39 &#x 0025;) eyes had infection of the intra-ocular tissues. The predominant bacterial species isolated was S. aureus (195 of 776; 25 &#x 0025;) followed by S. pneumoniae (169 of 776; 21. 78 &#x 0025;) and coagulase negative staphylococci (142 of 776; 18. 3 &#x 0025;). The largest number of gram-positive isolates were susceptible to cefazolin (545 of 624; 87. 34 &#x 0025;), chloramphenicol (522 of 624; 83. 65 &#x 0025;) and gatifloxacin (511 of 624; 81. 89 &#x 0025;) and gram-negative isolates were to amikacin (127 of 136; 93. 38 &#x 0025;), gatifloxacin (125 of 136; 91. 91 &#x 0025;) and ofloxacin (119 of 136; 87. 5 &#x 0025;), while aerobic actinomycetes were to amikacin (100 &#x 0025;), gatifloxacin (14 of 16; 87. 5 &#x 0025;), chloramphenicol (14 of 16; 87. 5 &#x 0025;) and ofloxacin (13 of 16; 81. 25 &#x 0025;). Conclusions: S. aureus frequently causes infections of eyelids and conjunctiva, S. pneumoniae of lacrimal apparatus and cornea and coagulase negative staphylococci causes intra-ocular infections. Of all routinely used antibacterials tested, flouroquinolones, especially gatifloxacin and ofloxacin represented {{a good choice for}} treating bacterial ocular infections...|$|E
30|$|Both Gram-positive and Gram-negative {{bacteria}} are increasingly becoming important both clinically and therapeutically as biological agents of ocular infections throughout the world. Various forms of ocular infections caused by pathogenic bacteria {{have been reported}} by different investigators. They include conjunctivitis, cornea perforation, orbital cellulitis, endophthalmitis, panophthalmitis and dacryocystitis, internal and external <b>hordeolum,</b> keratitis, scleritis, and canaliculitis [1 – 3]. Some of these infections carry poor prognosis as patients {{are at risk of}} losing either their sights or life, or both [2, 4]. This has necessitated the prompt detection of the etiologic agent and the timely institution of appropriate antibiotic treatment for patients with ocular infections. In Nigeria, conjunctivitis {{is one of the most}} common eye problems that affect all age groups. An epidemic of conjunctivitis was reported in Nigeria in 1971 [5]. In neonates, the incidence of conjunctivitis has been reported to be 18 per 1, 000 live births, and predisposing factors have been found to include vaginal delivery, asphyxia neonatorum, and prolonged rupture of the membrane [6]. A previous epidemiological study carried out by Abiose et al. [7] revealed conjunctivitis as among the causes of ophthalmic defects needing urgent medical attention in 10.4 % of the 5, 220 post-primary school Nigerian children screened. The routes of transmission of conjunctivitis have been identified to include air droplets, use of contaminated water for eye wash, hand to eye contact, and endogenous sources [2]. The pathology of conjunctivitis is symptomized by redness of the eye, grittiness, photophobia, and watery discharge. There may also be cornea involvement leading to subepithelial and epithelial keratitis. If untreated, conjunctivitis may degenerate pathologically to sight and life-threatening complications [8, 9]. Therefore, the early identification of etiologic agents and prompt institution of appropriate antibiotic therapy are essential for optimal eye care and restoration of a good eye health. Studies by investigators from other countries indicate that Gram-positive and Gram-negative {{bacteria are}} the most commonly isolated pathogens in patients with conjunctivitis, but variations exist in aetiologies, drug susceptibilities of pathogens, and antibiotic resistance mechanisms. Gram-positive bacteria such as Staphylococcus aureus, non-coagulase-positive Staphylococci, Bacillus sp., Corynebacterium sp., Streptococcus pneumoniae, Streptococcus pyogenes, and Streptococcus viridans have been implicated as aetiologies of conjunctivitis in patients [8, 10, 11]. In Gram-negative-mediated conjunctivitis, pathogens such as Pseudomonas aeruginosa, Escherichia coli, Proteus sp., Moraxella sp., and Neisseria gonorrhoeae have been isolated from conjunctival samples as etiologic agents [8, 12]. There are also indications that these pathogens elicit dynamism in order to achieve clonal success as agents of conjunctivitis coupled with their increasing propensity to develop resistance against the commonly used antibiotics in the form of eye drops and ointment to treat conjunctivitis. Plasmids, which are extrachromosomal double-stranded DNA materials, have been found to be useful for pathogens’ genetic diversity and prowess as infectious agents. Profiling pathogens for their harbored plasmids has been found to be very useful in epidemiological studies, diagnosis, and elucidation of mechanisms of drug resistance [13]. Plasmids have also been found useful in knowing whether two or more strains of a pathogen evolve from the same microorganism, thereby providing a reliable insight into the genetic relatedness of pathogens in an environment [14, 15].|$|E
