40|$|A {{receiving}} {{glass fibre}} (14) is provided {{into which the}} light coming from the excited accumulative luminescent material (34) is fed. One end (12 a) of the excitation glass fibre (12), which is positionable near to the accumulative luminescent material, is arranged next to an end (14 a) of the receiving glass fibre (14) near to the accumulative luminescent material (34). The excitation glass fibre (12) has a first numerical aperture. The receiving glass fibre (14) has a large second numerical aperture {{in relation to the}} first numerical aperture. The light coming from the excitation glass fibre is directed without optical arrangement directly to the accumulative luminescent material (34). USE/ADVANTAGE - For reading photo-stimulatable accumulative luminescent material, particularly in dental practice. A glass <b>fibre</b> <b>drum</b> scanner applying the principles of the invention is less costly to produce...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{deals with}} a {{comparative}} analysis of two different packaging and transport scenarios, which exemplifies the implications of choosing between single-use and reusable packaging. In particular, transport of a batch of chemicals by means of disposable <b>fibre</b> <b>drums</b> vs. reusable steel drums is investigated from a life cycle perspective, and the associated environmental impact in terms of Global Warming Potential, Acidification Potential, Gross Energy Requirement and solid waste generation is assessed. Results prove beyond reasonable doubt that, even {{in the case of}} durable packaging containers requiring the use of comparatively energy-intensive materials for their production, the reuse scenario is characterized by lower environmental impact indicators across the board, and as such is the most advisable and environmentally sound optionPreprin...|$|R
50|$|SMA {{is mixed}} {{and placed in}} the same plant as that used with {{conventional}} hot mix. In batch plants, the fibre additive is added direct to the pugmill using individually wrapped press packs or bulk dispensing equipment. Mixing times may be extended ensure that fibre is homogeneously distributed throughout the mix and temperatures controlled in order to avoid overheating or damage to the <b>fibre.</b> In <b>drum</b> plants, particular care must be taken to ensure that both the additional filler content and fibre additive are incorporated into the mixture without excessive losses through the dust extraction system. Filler systems that add filler directly into the drum rather than aggregate feed are preferred. Pelletised fibres may be added through systems designed for addition of recycled materials, but a more effective means is addition through a special delivery line that is combined with the bitumen delivery, so that the fibre is captured by bitumen at the point of addition to the mixture.|$|R
50|$|It is {{possible}} to spin directly from a clean fleece, but {{it is much easier}} to spin a carded fleece. Carding by hand yields a rolag, a loose woollen roll of <b>fibres.</b> Using a <b>drum</b> carder yields a bat, which is a mat of fibres in a flat, rectangular shape. Carding mills return the fleece in a roving, which is a stretched bat; it is very long and often the thickness of a wrist.A pencil roving is a roving thinned to the width of a pencil. It can used for knitting without any spinning, or for apprentices.|$|R
