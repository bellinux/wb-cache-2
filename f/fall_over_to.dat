60|$|The {{first of}} these qualities {{is due to the}} unusual {{strength}} of the lifeboat, not only in reference to the excellence of the materials with which it is made, but also to {{the manner in which the}} planks are laid on. These cross one another in a diagonal manner, which cannot be easily described or explained to ordinary readers; but it is sufficient to say that the method has the effect of binding the entire boat together in a way that renders it much stronger than any other species of craft. The second quality--that of insubmergibility--is due to air-chambers fixed round the sides of the boat, under the seats, and at the bow and stern. These air-cases are sufficiently buoyant to float the boat even if she were filled to overflowing with water and crowded to her utmost capacity with human beings. In short, to use an expression which may appear paradoxical, she can carry more than she can hold--has floating power sufficient to support more than can be got into her. The third--her self-righting quality--is also due to air-chambers, in connection with a heavy keel. There are two large and prominent air-cases in the lifeboat--one in the bow, the other in the stern. These rise considerably above the gunwale, insomuch that when the boat is turned upside-down it rests upon them as upon two pivots. Of course it cannot remain stationary on them for a moment, but must necessarily <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> the one side or the other. This is the first motion in self-righting; then the heavy keel comes into play, and pulls the boat quite round. Being full of water, the lifeboat would be comparatively useless but for its fourth quality--that of self-emptying. This is accomplished by means of six large holes which run through the floor and bottom of the boat. The floor referred to is air-tight, and is so placed that when fully manned and loaded with passengers it is a very little above the level of the sea. On this fact the acting of the principle depends. Between the floor and the bottom of the boat--a space of upwards of a foot in depth--there is some light ballast of cork or of wood, and some parts of the space are left empty. The six holes above-mentioned are tubes of six inches in diameter, which extend from the floor through the bottom of the boat. Now, it is one of nature's laws that water must find its level. For instance, take any boat and bore large holes in its bottom, and suppose it to be supported in its ordinary floating position, so that it cannot sink even though water runs freely into it through the holes. Then fill it suddenly quite full of water. Of course the water inside will be considerably above the level of the water outside, but it will continue to run out at the holes until it is exactly on a level with the water outside. Now, water poured into a lifeboat acts exactly in the same way; but when it has reached the level of the water outside it has also reached the floor, so that there is no more water to run out.|$|E

40|$|Abstract: In {{this paper}} we design a swing-up {{controller}} making the pendubot {{transition from the}} low-high to the high-high equilibrium {{in such a way}} that during the swing-up phase the unactuated link does not <b>fall</b> <b>over.</b> <b>To</b> achieve this control objective, we design and stabilize a virtual holonomic constraint expressing a relationship between the angles of the actuated and unactuated links. Such relationship guarantees that the unactuated link does not fall over. Then, in order to stabilize the energy level corresponding to the high-high equilibrium while preserving the invariance of the virtual constraint, we dynamically change the geometry of the constraint. 1...|$|E
40|$|There are 110 million uncleared landmines in 64 {{countries}} around the world (OSCE, 1998). There have been over 1 million landmine victims since 1975, and the number is growing at a rate of 26, 000 new victims each year (One World International, 2001). One solution, the Niagara FootTM (Niagara Prosthetics and Orthotics, St. Catharines, ON, Canada) (Fig. 1) is directed towards amputees in developing countries like Thailand and El Salvador. This prosthetic foot is low cost and highly durable, since it is made of a polymer from DuPont Delrin�. Structural stiffness is a force versus deflection relationship that {{is a result of the}} geometry, material and loading of the structure. If the foot is too stiff it is unresponsive. If the foot is too flexible, the person may <b>fall</b> <b>over.</b> <b>To</b> evaluate the stiffness performance of the Niagara FootTM a repeatable testing procedure is needed. There are two goals to this project: to investigate the repeatability of the mechanical test and to develop an accurate finite element (FE) model validated against the test results, such that the stiffness of subsequent foot designs can be simulated before the foot is manufactured...|$|E
40|$|Some {{degree of}} lateral {{curvature}} of the spine is common in post-encephalitic Parkinsonism, and in a proportion of the cases the body becomes markedly bent over to {{one side or the}} other. Although there is almost invariably some degree of antero-posterior deformity, the appearance from behind when the patient is standing or sitting usually shows an almost uniform lateral curve of the spinous processes, extending from sacrum to neck (Fig. 2) but in some instances concentrated in the mid-dorsal region (Fig. 4). The head is usually flexed in the same direc-tion as the trunk, but in some cases its tilt is to the other side. The patients become unable to hold their bodies erect while sitting, and <b>fall</b> <b>over</b> <b>to</b> what I will call the 'affected ' side. When standing and walking they may still be able to preserve their equilibrium but 'as time and the disease proceed ' they become so liable to fall that movement without a supporting or steadying arm is too perilous. One's first thought on observing such a patient is that {{the upper part of the}} body is drawn down by hypertonus (spasm) of the muscles, especially the long muscles, of the corresponding side, but closer examination shows, more often than not, that the muscular rigidity is greater on the other side. Of 14 patients with pronounced lateral scoliosis of the kind described here, eight are inclined to the side of lesser rigidity, four to the side of greater rigidity, and in the other two, in both of whom the curvature is pronounced, there is no significant difference in the degree of rigidity on the two sides, nor does the clinical history indicate that there was such a differ-ence at any stage...|$|E
