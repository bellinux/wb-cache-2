5|$|While Voyager 1 is {{commonly}} spoken of as <b>having</b> <b>left</b> the Solar System simultaneously with <b>having</b> <b>left</b> the heliosphere, {{the two are}} not the same. The Solar System is usually defined as the vastly larger region of space populated by bodies that orbit the Sun. The craft is presently less than one seventh {{the distance to the}} aphelion of Sedna, and it has not yet entered the Oort cloud, the source region of long-period comets, regarded by astronomers as the outermost zone of the Solar System.|$|E

On 24 April 1900 {{a party of}} three from an Italian expedition led by the Duke of the Abruzzi reached 86°34′N, <b>having</b> <b>left</b> Franz Josef Land with dogs and sledges on 11 March.

5|$|Although naval aviators were, at that time, {{prohibited}} from marriage {{within two years}} of getting their wings, <b>having</b> <b>left</b> the navy, the marriage could go ahead. John and Jane were married on 5 July 1941 at the First Presbyterian Church of Houston, Texas. After a two-day honeymoon in a Houston hotel, they flew to San Francisco {{to meet up with}} other AVG recruits and their wives. They parted company on 10 July 1941 at the docks, where Newkirk boarded the M.V. Jagersfontein, with some of the AVG recruits on their way to Singapore, whilst Janie stayed in Los Angeles.|$|E

5|$|Arias' {{maternal}} {{family was}} from Nicaragua, <b>having</b> <b>left</b> during political upheaval there before his birth. One of Arias' great uncles {{ran for president}} in Panama, while another was {{a supporter of the}} Nicaraguan revolutionary Sandino, a family history that gave Arias an early interest in politics. His father, an engineer, died when Arias was two years old, and he was raised primarily by his mother, aunt, and grandmother. His mother later remarried to a Panamanian ambassador to the United States.|$|E
5|$|At {{the end of}} the play, {{the actors}} file out slowly (most {{important}} first, with gaps between actors), and while they are on the bridge (hashigakari), the audience claps restrainedly. Between actors, clapping ceases, then begins again as the next actor leaves. Unlike in western theatre, there is no bowing, nor do the actors return to the stage after <b>having</b> <b>left.</b> A play may end with the shite character leaving the stage as part of the story (as in Kokaji, for instance)—rather than ending with all characters on stage—in which case one claps as the character exits.|$|E
5|$|Belgrano also {{experienced}} paludism (malaria) {{during the second}} campaign to Upper Peru. On 3 May 1815 he informed the government of his disease, which {{made it difficult for}} him to work or even talk. He was treated by doctor Joseph Readhead, who employed a local species of the Cinchona medicinal plant. The disease lasted up to his stay in Britain, when his health improved because of the treatment and by <b>having</b> <b>left</b> the endemic zone.|$|E

5|$|German {{politicians}} of the then government parties (Social Democrats and Liberals) {{as well as}} the opposition (the conservative Union parties) generally acclaimed the non-violent outcome of the hijacking. This reflected the public opinion that with the Munich attackers <b>having</b> <b>left</b> the country, the risk of further terrorist acts against German targets had diminished. Criticism evolved around the lack of sufficient airport security to prevent explosives being smuggled into passenger airliners, and Lufthansa not employing sky marshals, which at that time were already common on certain flights by El Al, Pan Am, Swissair, and others.|$|E
5|$|League {{football}} {{was suspended for}} the rest of the war, with Leeds City playing in regional competitions. With many players away fighting or <b>having</b> <b>left</b> the game due to a drop in wages, Leeds relied heavily on guest players during these matches. Chapman, meanwhile, had decided to help the war effort by taking up a position as manager of a munitions factory at Barnbow, near Cross Gates in 1916. For the next two years, City's assistant manager, George Cripps stood in for Chapman on the administrative side, while chairman Joe Connor and another director took charge of the team.|$|E

5|$|Only {{the words}} {{exchanged}} by {{the bride and}} groom (including the speaking of the name of Eru Ilúvatar) and the consummation are required for marriage. More formally, the couple's families celebrate the marriage with a feast. The parties give back their betrothal rings and receive others worn on their index fingers. The bride’s mother gives the groom a jewel to wear (Galadriel's gift of the Elfstone to Aragorn reflects this tradition; she is grandmother to his betrothed, Arwen, Arwen's mother Celebrían <b>having</b> <b>left</b> Middle-earth for Valinor after grievous psychological injury after her capture by Orcs and liberation by her sons).|$|E
5|$|Sometime {{prior to}} 1762, Scott's older brother, John, died, leaving Scott to inherit his father's land near the James River and Muddy Creek. <b>Having</b> <b>left</b> the army, he had settled on his {{inherited}} farm by late 1761. On February 25, 1762, he married Frances Sweeney from Cumberland County, Virginia. With {{the help of}} approximately 10 slaves, Scott engaged in growing tobacco and milling flour on his farm. In July 1766, he was named one of two captains in the local militia. Over the next several years, Scott {{and his wife had}} four boys and four or five girls.|$|E
5|$|The McCanns {{and their}} friends left the {{restaurant}} roughly every half-hour to check on their children. Madeleine's father carried out the first check on 5A at around 21:05. The children were asleep and all was well, except that he recalled <b>having</b> <b>left</b> the children's bedroom door slightly ajar, and now it stood almost wide open.
