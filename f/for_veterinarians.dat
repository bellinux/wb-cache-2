25|$|The use of maggot {{therapy is}} not limited to humans, {{but it is not a}} common {{practice}} with livestock. Using maggot therapy with livestock could be beneficial in many ways. In dairy cattle, it would eliminate the need to destroy milk contaminated with antibiotics. The use of antibiotics on horses can affect its gastrointestinal flora which may result in colitis. Maggot therapy would eliminate this additional stress when treating equine wounds. Treatment options for the animals of people who cannot afford expensive surgeries would be a new possibility <b>for</b> <b>veterinarians</b> using this therapy.|$|E

Canned [...] "treats" [...] for cats were first test-marketed in 1958. They were initially popular {{on the west coast}} of the United States, but not in the east. In 1959, Carnation executives considered withdrawing from the east coast market, because its cat food products weren't popular there, but decided to stay. A Carnation report found that consumers [...] preferred more upscale, single-serving food products, so the treats were rebranded as single-serving, canned foods called [...] "Friskies Buffet" [...] in 1967. Buffet became one of Friskies' best-sellers.|$|E

2500|$|Most {{veterinary}} {{schools do}} not allow students to engage in [...] "species specialization", and students {{must be able to}} treat a broad range of species. However, most veterinary programs allow students to take elective courses which will enable them to specialize at graduation. [...] Veterinary schools in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States engage in [...] "tracking", and students are asked which branch of veterinary medicine they intend to practice (such as companion-animal, bovine, equine, food-supply, avian, wildlife, and public-health). Although tracking is controversial, about 60 percent of US and Canadian veterinary schools engage in full or partial tracking of students and there are calls for full tracking by some North American veterinary-medical-education organizations. It is argued that enhanced tracking should be linked to [...] "limited licensure" [...] of veterinarians to practice only in the species (or specialty) in which they were trained.

2500|$|Surgical {{treatment}} is best, {{when it can}} be performed. [...] Pressure within the portal vein is measured as the shunt is closed, {{and it must be}} kept below 20cm H2O or else portal hypertension will ensue. [...] Methods of shunt attenuation should aim to slowly occlude the vessel over several weeks to months in order to avoid complications associated with portal hypertension. These methods include ameroid ring constrictors, cellophane banding, intravascular or percutaneous silicone hydraulic occluders. The most common methods of attenuation used by veterinarians are ameroid ring constrictors and cellophane banding. Both methods have reportedly good outcomes in both cats and dogs, although the true composition of readily sourced cellophane {{has been found to be}} made from plastics (inert) and not cellulose (stimulates a fibrous reaction). Recently, a commercial supplier of regenerated cellulose based cellophane <b>for</b> <b>veterinarians</b> has been established for use of [...] Complete closure of extrahepatic shunts results in a very low recurrence rate, while incomplete closure results in a recurrence rate of about 50 percent. [...] However, not all dogs with extrahepatic shunts tolerate complete closure (16 to 68 percent). [...] Intrahepatic shunts are much more difficult to surgically correct than extrahepatic shunts due to their hidden nature, large vessel size, and greater tendency toward portal hypertension when completely closed. [...] When surgery is not an option, PSS is treated as are other forms of liver failure. [...] Dietary protein restriction is helpful to lessen signs of hepatic encephalopathy, and antibiotics such as neomycin or metronidazole and other medicines such as lactulose can reduce ammonia production and absorption in the intestines. [...] The prognosis is guarded for any form of PSS.|$|E
