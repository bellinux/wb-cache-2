25|$|Episodic ataxia (EA) is an {{autosomal}} dominant disorder characterized by sporadic bouts of ataxia (severe discoordination) {{with or without}} myokymia (continuous muscle movement). There are seven types recognised but the majority are due to two recognized entities. Ataxia can be provoked by stress, startle, or heavy exertion such as exercise. Symptoms can first appear in infancy. There are at least 6 loci for EA, of which 4 are known genes. Some patients with EA also have migraine or progressive cerebellar degenerative disorders, symptomatic of either familial <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraine</b> or spinocerebellar ataxia. Some patients respond to acetazolamide though others do not.|$|E
40|$|Localized {{scleroderma}} {{is a rare}} disease, {{characterized by}} sclerotic lesions. A variety of presentations have been described, with different clinical characteristics and specific prognosis. In scleroderma en coup de sabre (LScs) the atrophic lesion in frontoparietal area is the disease hallmark. Skin and subcutaneous are the mainly affected tissues, but case reports of muscle, cartilage, and bone involvement are frequent. These cases pose a difficult differential diagnosis with Parry-Romberg syndrome. Once considered an exclusive cutaneous disorder, the neurologic involvement present in LScs has been described in several case reports. Seizures are most frequently observed, but focal neurologic deficits, movement disorders, trigeminal neuralgia, and mimics of <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraines</b> have been reported. Computed tomography and magnetic resonance imaging have aided the characterization of central nervous system lesions, and cerebral angiograms have pointed to vasculitis {{as a part of}} disease pathogenesis.

40|$|Episodic {{migraine}} is {{a common}} debilitating condition with significant worldwide impact. An effective management plan must include acute treatment to relieve the pain and potential disability associated with the attacks and may also include preventative treatments with an aim of decreasing attack frequency and severity in the longer term. Acute treatments must be limited {{to a maximum of}} 2 - 3 days a week to prevent medication overuse headache and focus on simple analgesia, non-steroidal anti-inflammatory drugs and triptans. Preventative treatments are numerous and should be considered when migraine attacks are frequent and or disabling, acute medication is failing, in special circumstances such as <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraines</b> or if the patient requests them. All preventative medications must be given at therapeutic doses for at least 6 - 8 weeks before an adequate trial can be judged ineffective. The most important factor in choosing drugs is the patient and the clinical features of their attack and treatment should be tailored to these. Relative co-morbidities will influence drug choice, as will the side effect profile and the efficacy of the drug. First line preventative drugs include ß-blockers, amitriptyline and anti-epileptic drugs such as topiramate and valproate. Drugs with lower efficacy or poorer side effect profiles include selective serotonin reuptake inhibitors (SSRIs), calcium channel antagonists, gabapentin and herbal medicines...|$|R
25|$|Type 2 episodic ataxia (EA2) is {{characterized}} by acetazolamide-responsive attacks of ataxia with or without migraine. Patients with EA2 may also present with progressive cerebellar atrophy, nystagmus, vertigo, visual disturbances and dysarthria. These symptoms last from hours to days, in contrast with EA1, which lasts from seconds to minutes. Like EA1, attacks can be precipitated by emotional or physical stress, but also by coffee and alcohol. EA2 is caused by mutations in CACNA1A, which encodes the P/Q-type voltage-gated calcium channel CaV2.1, and is also the gene responsible for causing spinocerebellar ataxia type-6 and familial <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraine</b> type-1. EA2 is {{also referred to as}} episodic ataxia with nystagmus, hereditary paroxysmal cerebellopathy, familial paroxysmal ataxia and acetazolamide-responsive hereditary paroxysmal cerebellar ataxia (AHPCA). There are currently 19 mutations associated with EA2, though only 3 have been characterized electrophysiologically, table 2 and figure 2. Of these, all result in decreased current through these channels. It is assumed that the other mutations, especially the splicing and frameshift mutations, also result in a drastic decrease in CaV2.1 currents, though {{this may not be the}} case for all mutations. CACNA1A is heavily expressed in Purkinje cells of the cerebellum where it is involved in coupling action potentials with neurotransmitter release. Thus, decrease in Ca2+ entry through CaV2.1 channels is expected to result in decreased output from Purkinje cells, even though they will fire at an appropriate rate. Alternatively, some CACNA1A mutations, such as those seen in familial <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraine</b> type-1, result in increased Ca2+ entry and, thereby, aberrant transmitter release. This can also result in excitotoxicity, as may occur in some cases of spinocerebellar ataxia type-6.|$|E
25|$|The second subtype of {{familial}} <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraine,</b> FHM2, {{is caused}} by mutations in the gene ATP1A2 that encodes a /-ATPase. This /-ATPase is heavily expressed in astrocytes and helps to set and maintain their reversal potential. There are 29 known mutations in this gene associated with FHM2, Table 2, many clustering in the large intracellular loop between membrane-spanning segments 4 and 5, Figure 1. 12 of these mutations have been studied by expression in model cells. All but one have shown either complete loss of function or more complex decreases in ATPase activity or potassium sensitivity. Astrocytes expressing these mutant ion pumps will have much higher resting potentials and are believed to lead to disease through a poorly understood mechanism.|$|E
2500|$|Familial <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraine</b> (FHM) is an {{autosomal}} dominant type of <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraine</b> that typically includes weakness {{of half the}} body which can last for hours, days or weeks. It can be accompanied by other symptoms, such as ataxia, coma and paralysis. There is clinical overlap in some FHM patients with episodic ataxia type 2 and spinocerebellar ataxia type 6, benign familial infantile epilepsy, and alternating hemiplegia of childhood. There are 3 known loci for FHM. FHM1, which accounts for approximately 50% of FHM patients, is caused by mutations in a gene coding for the P/Q-type calcium channel α subunit, CACNA1A. FHM1 is also associated with cerebellar degeneration. FHM2, which accounts for <25% of FHM cases, is caused by mutations in the /-ATPase gene ATP1A2. FHM3 is a rare subtype of FHM and is caused by mutations in a sodium channel α-subunit coding gene, SCN1A. These three subtypes do not account for all cases of FHM, suggesting the existence {{of at least one}} other locus (FHM4). Many of the non-familial cases of <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraine</b> (sporadic <b>hemiplegic</b> <b>migraine)</b> are also caused by mutations at these loci. A fourth gene that has been associated with this condition is the proline rich transmembrane protein 2 (PRRT2) - an axonal protein associated with the exocytosis complex.

Presently, guidelines for the treatment of migraine do not address the use of combination products or products in combination for migraine management. 2 The American Academy of Neurology’s (AAN) evidence-based guidelines recommend linking the intensity of care for migraine headaches with the level of disability and symptoms, which is called stratified care. Accordingly, the guidelines recommend using of triptans as first-line therapy for the acute treatment of migraine in those whose symptoms are moderate to severe and in those who have mild to moderate migraine headaches that respond poorly to NSAIDs or other simple analgesics; for example, caffeine combinations. AAN guidelines recommend the use of NSAIDs as first-line therapy for the treatment of mild to moderate migraine headaches, with grade A evidence given for the use of ibuprofen...|$|R

40|$|The use of {{instrumental}} examinations in headache patients varies widely. In order {{to evaluate their}} usefulness, the most common instrumental procedures were evaluated, {{on the basis of}} evidence from the literature, by an EFNS Task Force (TF) on neurophysiological tests and imaging procedures in non-acute headache patients. The conclusions of the TF regarding each technique are expressed in the following guidelines for clinical use. 1 Interictal electroencephalography (EEG) is not routinely indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of headache patients. Interictal EEG is. however, indicated if the clinical history suggests a possible diagnosis of epilepsy (differential diagnosis). Ictal EEG could be useful in certain patients suffering from <b>hemiplegic</b> and basilar <b>migraine.</b> 2 Recording of evoked potentials is not recommended for the diagnosis of headache disorders. 3 There is no evidence to justify the recommendation of autonomic tests for the routine clinical examination of headache patients. 4 Manual palpation of pericranial muscles, with standardized palpation pressure, can be recommended for subdividing patient groups but not for diagnosis. Pressure algometry and electromyography (EMG) cannot be recommended as clinical diagnostic tests. 5 In adult and paediatric patients with migraine, with no recent change in attack pattern, no history of seizures, and no other Focal neurological signs or symptoms, the routine use of neuroimaging is not warranted. In patients with atypical headache patterns, a history Of seizures and/or focal neurological signs or symptoms, magnetic resonance imaging (MRI) may be indicated. 6 If attacks can be fully accounted for by the standard headache classification [International Headache Society (IHS) ], a positron emission tomography (PET) or single-photon emission computerized tomography (SPECT) and scan will generally be of no further diagnostic value. 7 Nuclear medicine examinations of the cerebral circulation and metabolism can be carried out in Subgroups of headache patients for diagnosis and evaluation of complications, when patients experience unusually severe attacks, or when the quality or severity of attacks has changed. 8 Transcranial Doppler examination is not helpful in headache diagnosis.

40|$|Background and purpose: A {{large number}} of {{instrumental}} investigations are used in patients with non-acute headache in both research and clinical fields. Although the literature has shown {{that most of these}} tools contributed greatly to increasing understanding of the pathogenesis of primary headache, they are of little or no value in the clinical setting. Methods: This paper provides an update of the 2004 EFNS guidelines and recommendations for the use of neurophysiological tools and neuroimaging procedures in non-acute headache (first edition). Even though the period since the publication of the first edition has seen {{an increase in the number}} of published papers dealing with this topic, the updated guidelines contain only minimal changes in the levels of evidence and grades of recommendation. Results: (i) Interictal EEG is not routinely indicated in the diagnostic evaluation of patients with headache. Interictal EEG is, however, indicated if the clinical history suggests a possible diagnosis of epilepsy (differential diagnosis). Ictal EEG could be useful in certain patients suffering from <b>hemiplegic</b> or basilar <b>migraine.</b> (ii) Recording evoked potentials is not recommended for the diagnosis of headache disorders. (iii) There is no evidence warranting recommendation of reflex responses or autonomic tests for the routine clinical examination of patients with headache. (iv) Manual palpation of pericranial muscles, with standardized palpation pressure, can be recommended for subdividing patient groups but not for diagnosis. Pain threshold measurements and EMG are not recommended as clinical diagnostic tests. (v) In adult and pediatric patients with migraine, with no recent change in attack pattern, no history of seizures, and no other focal neurological symptoms or signs, the routine use of neuroimaging is not warranted. In patients with trigeminal autonomic cephalalgia, neuroimaging should be carefully considered and may necessitate additional scanning of intracranial/cervical vasculature and/or the sellar/orbital/(para) nasal region. In patients with atypical headache patterns, a history of seizures and/or focal neurological symptoms or signs, MRI may be indicated. (vi) If attacks can be fully accounted for by the standard headache classification (IHS), a PET or SPECT scan will normally be of no further diagnostic value. Nuclear medical examinations of the cerebral circulation and metabolism can be carried out in subgroups of patients with headache for the diagnosis and evaluation of complications, when patients experience unusually severe attacks or when the quality or severity of attacks has changed. (vii) Transcranial Doppler examination is not helpful in headache diagnosis. Conclusion: Although many of the examinations described in the present guidelines are of little or no value in the clinical setting, most of the tools, including thermal pain thresholds and transcranial magnetic stimulation, have considerable potential for differential diagnostic evaluation as well as for the further exploration of headache pathophysiology and the effects of pharmacological treatment. © 2010 The Author(s).
