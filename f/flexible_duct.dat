The male moves to the underside of the sperm web and takes up the sperm into the sperm ducts of the palpal bulbs, either through the base of the web or around its side. Various mechanisms have been proposed to explain how the sperm is taken up. Capillary action and gravity are two possibilities. Where the sperm duct has rigid walls, removal of the liquid via the epithelium surrounding them may suck sperm into the duct. The reverse mechanism may explain how the sperm is ejected.

With the pressure drop data gathered, equations were developed to approximate the pressure loss at a given air flow rate for a given duct size.

It was determined that pressure losses for compression ratios greater than 4 % were over four times greater than maximum stretched <b>flexible</b> <b>duct</b> of corresponding duct size.

40|$|Duct leakage {{has been}} {{identified}} as a major source of energy loss in residential buildings. Most duct leakage occurs at the connections to registers, plenums or branches in the duct system. At each of these connections a method of sealing the duct system is required. Typical sealing methods include tapes or mastics applied around the joints in the system. Field examinations of duct systems have typically shown that these seals tend to fail over extended periods of time. The Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory has been testing sealant durability for several years. Typical duct tape (i. e. fabric backed tapes with natural rubber adhesives) was found to fail more rapidly than all other duct sealants. This report summarizes the results of duct sealant durability testing of five UL 181 B-FX listed duct tapes (three cloth tapes, a foil tape and an Oriented Polypropylene (OPP) tape). One of the cloth tapes was specifically developed in collaboration with a tape manufacturer to perform better in our durability testing. The first test involved the aging of common ''core-to-collar joints'' of <b>flexible</b> <b>duct</b> to sheet metal collars, and sheet metal ''collar-to-plenum joints'' pressurized with 200 F (93 C) air. The second test consisted of baking duct tape specimens in a constant 212 F (100 C) oven following the UL 181 B-FX ''Temperature Test'' requirements. Additional tests were also performed on only two tapes using sheet metal collar-to-plenum joints. Since an unsealed <b>flexible</b> <b>duct</b> joint can have a variable leakage depending on the positioning of the <b>flexible</b> <b>duct</b> core, the durability of the <b>flexible</b> <b>duct</b> joints could not be based on the 10 % of unsealed leakage criteria. Nevertheless, the leakage of the sealed specimens prior to testing could be considered as a basis for a failure criteria. Visual inspection was also documented throughout the tests. The <b>flexible</b> <b>duct</b> core-to-collar joints were inspected monthly, while the sheet metal collar-to-plenum joints were inspected weekly. The baking test specimens were visually inspected weekly, and the durability was judged by the observed deterioration in terms of brittleness, cracking, flaking and blistering (the terminology used in the UL 181 B-FX test procedure) ...|$|E

The 2 -D <b>flexible</b> <b>duct</b> core-to-collar joints passed the six-month period of the aging test in terms of leakage, but {{with the exception of the}} foil-butyl tape, showed degradation in terms hardening, brittleness, partial peeling, shrinkage, wrinkling, delamination of the tape layers, flaking, cracking, bubbling, oozing and discoloration. The baking test results showed that the failure in the duct tape joints could be attributed to the type of combination of the duct tape and the material it is applied to, as the duct tape behaves differently with different substrates. Overall, the foil-butyl tape (Tape 4) had the best results, while the film tape (Tape 3) showed the most deterioration.

40|$|Noise {{radiation}} from a <b>flexible</b> rectangular <b>duct</b> wall in a transverse direction involves {{a phenomenon of}} acoustic-structural coupling. Maximum sound radiation happens near coupling modes due to effective energy exchange between acoustic-structural subsystems.

The present paper discusses the mode coupling approach and Impedance-Mobility formulation. Mode coupling approach {{is used to calculate}} the coupled natural frequency.

40|$|Propagation {{of sound}} in a <b>flexible</b> <b>duct</b> is {{investigated}} both theoretically and experimentally. Strong coupling {{of sound and}} flexural waves on the duct wall is found when the wall-to-air mass ratio is {{of the order of}} unity. The axial phase speed of sound approaches the in vacuo speed of flexural waves (subsonic in this case) at low frequencies. However, a speed higher than the isentropic sound speed in free space (340 m/s) is found beyond a critical frequency which {{is a function of the}} mass ratio. Experiments using a duct with a finite section of tensioned membrane are compared with the propagating modes pertaining to the infinite membrane model. Satisfactory quantitative agreement is obtained and the measured phase speed ranges from 8. 3 to 1348 m/s. In the moderate frequency range, the theory predicts high spatial damping rate for the subsonic waves, which is consistent with the experimental observation that subsonic waves become increasingly undetectable as the frequency increases. Substantial sound reflection is observed at the interface between the rigid and the flexible segments of the duct without cross-section discontinuity, which, together with the high spatial damping, could form a basis for passive control of low-frequency duct noise.

40|$|A {{computer-based}} simulation system {{creates a}} visual and haptic virtual environment for training a medical practitioner in laparoscopic surgery. Heretofore, {{it has been}} common practice to perform training in partial laparoscopic surgical procedures by use of a laparoscopic training box that encloses a pair of laparoscopic tools, objects to be manipulated by the tools, and an endoscopic video camera. However, the surgical procedures simulated by use of a training box are usually poor imitations of the actual ones. The present computer-based system improves training by presenting a more realistic simulated environment to the trainee. The system includes a computer monitor that displays a real-time image of the affected interior region of the patient, showing laparoscopic instruments interacting with organs and tissues, as would be viewed by use of an endoscopic video camera and displayed to a surgeon during a laparoscopic operation. The system also includes laparoscopic tools that the trainee manipulates while observing {{the image on the}} computer monitor (see figure). The instrumentation on the tools consists of (1) position and orientation sensors that provide input data for the simulation and (2) actuators that provide force feedback to simulate the contact forces between the tools and tissues. The simulation software includes components that model the geometries of surgical tools, components that model the geometries and physical behaviors of soft tissues, and components that detect collisions between them. Using the measured positions and orientations of the tools, the software detects whether they are in contact with tissues. In the event of contact, the deformations of the tissues and contact forces are computed by use of the geometric and physical models. The image on the computer screen shows tissues deformed accordingly, while the actuators apply the corresponding forces to the distal ends of the tools.
