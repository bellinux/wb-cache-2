2500|$|Panopticon was an overtly {{political}} release, {{and arguably}} the clearest statement made within their music yet. It displayed fears of surveillance and of tacit governmental influence; its namesake, the panopticon, was Jeremy Bentham's concept for a prison {{system in which}} all the prisoners can be viewed by one guard in a central tower, without being able to know whether they are being observed or not. Bentham described the Panopticon as [...] "a new mode of obtaining power of mind over mind, in a quantity hitherto without example." [...] Quizzed on government conspiracies, Turner states: [...] "I do believe that <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> our government and the huge corporate entities of this country lie to us about numerous subjects. In this respect we are all victims of a huge conspiracy—most of those in power are only concerned with the advancement of their agendas and have no qualms about deceiving and hurting the American people." ...|$|E

60|$|Carrie Leland {{was struck}} by {{something}} in her husband's face. It was a comely face, as well as forceful, clean-skinned {{in spite of its}} deepness of tint, and there was a clearness in the steady eyes that is only seen in those of such men as he. There was also in his features a suggestion of endurance and optimism that, in fact, was strongest in the time of stress and struggle. Sun and wind, fruitful soil and barren, nipping frosts, drought and devastating hail, all these were things to be grappled with or profited by with equal willingness. He and his kind in new countries give without stint all they have been given, from the sweat of tense effort <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> to the smiling courage that cuts down hours of rest and goes on sowing when seasons are adverse and markets fall away; and there is, in turn, usually set upon them plainly the symbol of man's dominion over the material world. The patient beasts that toiled with him recognised it, and again one of them muzzled his shoulder and caught at his arm.|$|E
6000|$|Orion's boyhood {{was spent}} in that wee little log hamlet of Jamestown up there among the [...] "knobs"--so called--of East Tennessee. The family {{migrated}} to Florida, Missouri, then moved to Hannibal, Missouri, when Orion was twelve {{and a half years}} old. When he was fifteen or sixteen he was sent to St. Louis and there he learned the printer's trade. One of his characteristics was eagerness. He woke with an eagerness about some matter or other every morning; it consumed him all day; it perished in the night and he was on fire with a fresh new interest next morning before he could get his clothes on. He exploited in this way three hundred and sixty-five red-hot new eagernesses every year of his life. But I am forgetting another characteristic, a very pronounced one. That was his deep glooms, his despondencies, his despairs; these had their place in <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> along with the eagernesses. Thus his day was divided--no, not divided, mottled--from sunrise to midnight with alternating brilliant sunshine and black cloud. Every day he was the most joyous and hopeful man that ever was, I think, and also every day he was the most miserable man that ever was.|$|E
6000|$|Next in {{real and}} {{official}} rank and importance, after the conductor, came my delight, the driver--next in real {{but not in}} apparent importance--for {{we have seen that}} {{in the eyes of the}} common herd the driver was to the conductor as an admiral is to the captain of the flag-ship. The driver's beat was pretty long, and his sleeping-time at the stations pretty short, sometimes; and so, but for the grandeur of his position his would have been a sorry life, as well as a hard and a wearing one. We took a new driver every day or every night (for they drove backward and forward over the same piece of road all the time), and therefore we never got as well acquainted with them as we did with the conductors; and besides, they would have been above being familiar with such rubbish as passengers, anyhow, as a general thing. Still, we were always eager to get a sight of each and every new driver as soon as the watch changed, for <b>each</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> we were either anxious to get rid of an unpleasant one, or loath to part with a driver we had learned to like and had come to be sociable and friendly with. And so the first question we asked the conductor whenever we got to where we were to exchange drivers, was always, [...] "Which is him?" [...] The grammar was faulty, maybe, but we could not know, then, that it would go into a book some day. As long as everything went smoothly, the overland driver was well enough situated, but if a fellow driver got sick suddenly it made trouble, for the coach must go on, and so the potentate who was about to climb down and take a luxurious rest after his long night's siege in the midst of wind and rain and darkness, had to stay where he was and do the sick man's work. Once, in the Rocky Mountains, when I found a driver sound asleep on the box, and the mules going at the usual break-neck pace, the conductor said never mind him, there was no danger, and he was doing double duty--had driven seventy-five miles on one coach, and was now going back over it on this without rest or sleep. A hundred and fifty miles of holding back of six vindictive mules and keeping them from climbing the trees! It sounds incredible, but I remember the statement well enough.|$|E

40|$|Background: Little {{is known}} about inter-facility patient {{transfers}} in populations. In 2003, detailed information about inter-facility patient transfers began to be systemati-cally collected in Ontario.

Results: Approximately 1, 000 inter-facility patient transfers occur in Ontario <b>each</b> <b>day,</b> <b>and</b> <b>every</b> <b>day</b> <b>and</b> a half, the total distance travelled for these transfers equals the distance around the earth’s circumference. The annual cost for patient transfers is approximately $ 283 million. Most common were routine and non-urgent inter-facility patient transfers. Eighty-five thousand patients (24. 3 % of transferred patients) were transported between healthcare facilities for dialysis appointments, appointments with physicians and return trips home. Patients with circulatory conditions were the most commonly transferred diagnostic group. Although 70 % of all transfers were within 25 kilometres, some were for longer distances: for example, those involving pregnan...|$|R
