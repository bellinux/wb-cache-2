40|$|Abstract Background Because {{the gene}} {{expression}} patterns of nonobese hepatic steatosis in affected patients remain unclear, {{we sought to}} explore these patterns using an animal model of nonobese hepatic steatosis. Methods We developed mice that conditionally express the hepatitis C virus (HCV) core protein regulated by the tetracycline transactivator (tTA). Microarray analyses and reverse-transcription polymerase chain reaction were performed using liver samples of both the double transgenic mice (DTM), which express both the HCV core and tTA, and single transgenic mice (STM), which express tTA alone, at 2 months of age. Functional categories of genes with altered expression were classified using gene ontology programs. Serum glucose, lipid levels, and systemic blood pressure were also measured. Results Approximately 20 – 30 % of hepatocytes from the DTM were steatotic. No significant differences were observed in the serum glucose, lipid content, or blood pressure levels between the DTM and STM. Gene expression analyses revealed Sterol-regulatory element-binding protein (SREBP) pathway activation and dysregulation of the following genes involved in lipid metabolism: 3 -hydroxy- 3 -methylglutaryl-coenzyme A synthase 1, Apolipoprotein AII, Apolipoprotein CI, acyl-CoA thioesterase I, and fatty acid binding protein 1; in mitochondrial function: solute carrier family 25 member 25 and cytochrome c oxidase subunit II; in immune reaction: complement component 3, <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> 6 <b>complex,</b> locus A, <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> 6 <b>complex,</b> locus C, <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> 6 <b>complex,</b> locus D, and <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> 6 <b>complex,</b> locus E.

The anti-human <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> (HLA) antibody production, specificity, and immunoglobulin class were examined sequentially in 73 patients undergoing aortic valve replacement. In addition, the long-term production of antibodies was examined in a cross-sectional study of 160 patients at periods varying from 1 to 15 years postoperatively. <b>Human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> antibodies were produced in 17 of 30 antibioticsterilized homografts (56 %) and in 15 of 15 “homovital” homograft recipients, compared with 6 of the 28 control xenograft recipients (21 %) (p < 0. 001). The HLA antibodies were immunoglobulin G in all 15 homovital homografts, in 11 of 17 antibiotic-sterilized homografts, and {{in four of}} the six xenograft cases. <b>Human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> specificities could be assigned to the antibodies in 21 cases. In 10 of 11 cases in which donor HLA typing data were available, the antibodies detected were directed against donor HLA class I antigens. Of six possible determinants of HLA antibody production, the type of homograft valve implanted (homovital or antibiotic sterilized) correlated with antibody formation. In the crosssectional study, 66 of the 85 homovital homograft recipients tested for HLA antibodies after 1 year were found to have antibodies, compared with 29 of 75 antibioticsterilized homograft recipients (p = 0. 00003). We conclude that homografts appear to stimulate a strong donor HLA-specific antibody response, particularly of the immunoglobulin G class. This is most common in homovital valve recipients.

BackgroundThe <b>human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> (HLA) class II proteins (DR, DQ, and DP) and DM, a protein involved in loading antigenic peptide onto the class II molecules, have a coordinate regulation that facilitates antigen presentation to CD 4 + T cells. CIITA {{is a specific}} transcription factor responsible for the coordinate regulation of these genes. DR expression in the kidney was described to be constitutive on renal microvascular endothelium in the early 1980 s, but {{expression of}} other genes involved in class II antigen presentation (DQ, DP, DM, and CIITA) has not been characterized. MethodsExpression of the HLA class II proteins, DM, and CIITA in normal human kidney cortex was evaluated by immunofluorescence microscopy, Northern blots, and reverse transcriptase-polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR). ResultsThe endothelium of glomerular and peritubular capillaries constitutively express DR, as indicated by colocalization of DR and CD 31 antibodies. However, the endothelium of larger renal blood vessels is devoid of class II proteins. Capillaries that express DR do not have detectable DQ, DP, or DM by immunofluorescence. Northern blots identified DR, DP, and DM mRNAs but not DQ mRNA. CIITA was amplified by RT-PCR {{at a level that}} could account for the class II expressed by the microvascular endothelium. ConclusionThe renal microvascular endothelium constitutively expresses DR without the other class II proteins or DM.

Certain cryptic epitopes are consequently produced by antigen-presenting cells, and are effectively presented according to the available HLA molecules, with subsequent HLA-restricted autoantibody production.

40|$|SYNOPSIS. Malaria {{has been}} invoked, {{perhaps more than}} any other {{infectious}} disease, as a force for the selection of human genetic polymorphisms. Evidence for genome-shaping interactions can be found in the geographic and ethnic distributions of the hemoglobins, blood group antigens, thalassemias, red cell mem-brane molecules, <b>human</b> <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> (HLA) classes, and cytokines. Human immune responses and genetic variations can correspondingly influence the structure and polymorphisms of Plasmodium popula-tions, notably in genes that affect the success and virulence of infection. In Africa, where the burden from Plasmodium falciparum predominates, disease severity and manifestations vary in prevalence among human populations. The evolutionary history and spread of Plasmodium species inform our assessment of malaria as a selective force. Longstanding host-pathogen relationships, as well as recent changes in this dynamic, illustrate the selective pressures human and Plasmodium species place on one another.

At mucosal surfaces, including the ocular surface, only intraepithelial CD 8 + lymphocytes express HML- 1. These lymphocytes are {{retained in the}} intraepithelial compartment {{by virtue of the}} interaction between HML- 1 and its natural ligand, E-cadherin, which is expressed on epithelial cells. {{the purpose of this study}} was to determine whether ocular surface epithelial cells (ocular mucosa) could induce the expression of <b>human</b> mucosal <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> on peripheral blood <b>lymphocytes.</b> Methods: <b>Human</b> corneal and conjunctival epithelial cells were co-cultured with peripheral blood lymphocytes. Both non-activated and activated lymphocytes were used in the experiments. After 7 days of incubation, lymphocytes were recovered and analysed for the antigens CD 8 /HML- 1, CD 4 /HML- 1, CD 3 /CD 8, CD 3 /CD 4, CD 3 /CD 25, CD 8 /CD 25, and CD 4 /CD 25 by flowcytometry. Results: Significant statistical differences were observed in the CD 8 /HML- 1 expression when conjunctival epithelial cells were co-cultured with non-activated and activated lymphocytes (p = 0. 04 for each) and when corneal epithelial cells were co-cultured with non-activated lymphocytes (p = 0. 03). Significant statistical difference in CD 4 /HML- 1 expression was observed only when conjunctival epithelial cells were co-cultured with activated lymphocytes (p = 0. 02). Conclusion: Ocular surface epithelial cells can induce the expression of <b>human</b> mucosal <b>lymphocyte</b> <b>antigen</b> on CD 8 + (and to some extent on CD 4 +) lymphocytes.

By strategic labeling of single-stranded probe sequences, DHDA allows {{the identification of}} specific heteroduplex structures {{that contribute to the}} differentiation of DQAI and DQB 1 alleles. Because of the high degree of polymorphism among major histocompatibility complex class 11 second exon sequences, this analysis of 50 different heteroduplex molecules provides evidence of the importance of unpaired bases and mismatched base pairs and their effect on heteroduplex electrophoretic-mobility differences. This strategy is further used to genotype accurately a family for DQAI which was previously analyzed by sequence specific oligonucleotide (SSO) probe hybridization. To differentiate by SSO-typing among the DQA 1 and DQB 1 alleles analyzed in this study requires the use of 23 different probes. Equivalent results are obtained by DHDA using only three probes. Therefore, this study suggests that accurate HLA-typing can be simplified by DHDA. Additionally, DHDA may be useful for differentiation of DNA sequence polymorphisms in other genetic systems...|$|R

Second, SV 40 does not bind to cells of two different human lymphoblastoid cell lines which do not express surface class I MHC proteins because of genetic defects in the beta 2 -microglobulin gene in one line and in the HLA complex in the other. Transfection of these cell lines with cloned genes for beta 2 -microglobulin and HLA-B 8, respectively, restored expression of their surface class I MHC proteins and resulted in concomitant SV 40 binding.
