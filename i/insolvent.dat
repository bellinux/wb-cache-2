5|$|In 2002 the dry ski slope near Park Road and the Uxbridge Lido {{was closed}} and the {{remaining}} buildings and structures removed. The Hillingdon Ski Centre had been subject to several arson attacks during 2001 and the company operating it became <b>insolvent.</b> The slope, which had been built in 1977, was left to return to nature.|$|E
5|$|In July 2009 the {{receivers}} {{determined that the}} company was <b>insolvent.</b> With a complex business structure to unravel, some commentators expect it may take years for the company's collapse to be fully resolved. By April 2010, timber company Gunns had taken over as the responsible entity running most of Great Southern's pulpwood schemes, but the land on which they were being grown was yet to be sold.|$|E
5|$|In July 2011, FIA Leveraged Fund, an {{investment}} vehicle managed by Fletcher Asset Management, {{was unable to}} meet a redemption request, totaling $144 million, by three Louisiana pension fund investors. In April 2012, the Grand Court of the Cayman Islands ruled that the fund was <b>insolvent</b> and ordered that it be wound up (liquidated).|$|E

50|$|It {{is crucial}} {{that the company is}} in {{insolvency}} proceedings, and that it has assets that need to be dealt with under those proceedings. What is then important is the effect of the impugned arrangement on the treatment of the <b>insolvent’s</b> assets on its insolvency.|$|R
5|$|Rangers became <b>insolvent</b> in February 2012 and {{was unable}} to reach a company {{voluntary}} arrangement with its creditors, principally HM Revenue and Customs. Ibrox Stadium, along with the business and other assets of Rangers, was sold in June 2012 to a new company run by Charles Green. The new company obtained the SFA membership of the old Rangers FC company and gained entry to the Scottish Football League Third Division.|$|E
5|$|Shortly {{after the}} end of World War II, Union Bank of Switzerland {{completed}} the acquisition of the Eidgenössische Bank, a large Zürich-based bank that became <b>insolvent.</b> As a result of the merger, Union Bank of Switzerland exceeded CHF 1billion in assets and moved its operations to Zurich. UBS opened branches and acquired a series of banks in Switzerland in the following years, growing from 31 offices in 1950 to 81 offices by the early 1960s.|$|E
5|$|Trans Polar issued {{new shares}} worth NOK825,000 on 25 November 1970. At the same time, the airline's {{shareholders}} issued guarantees {{to the bank}} for NOK1.2 million. This was increased by NOK300,000 in December. The company was <b>insolvent</b> at this time, but the creditors chose to instate a lawyer as chairman and continue operations. The airline met with its largest creditors on 25 February in an unsuccessful attempt to refinance the company's debt.|$|E
50|$|If an IP is appointed, the OR will {{hand over}} administration. Otherwise, the OR acts as trustee or {{liquidator}} {{to sell the}} assets, distribute the proceeds to creditors, and complete {{the administration of the}} estate (mostly achieved within 12 months of the insolvency order). Whether or not the OR continues as trustee or liquidator, he remains responsible for investigating the <b>insolvent's</b> affairs.|$|R
40|$|The {{spectacular}} {{growth in}} popularity of Part IX debt agreements {{raises the question}} of whether this insolvency option is fulfilling the task for which it was designed, ie providing a viable low cost alternative to bankruptcy for low-income <b>insolvents</b> with few assets and few creditors. This research indicates that, while such agreements are the preserve of the less affluent because of their qualifying limitations, they are not the preserve of the least affluent among <b>insolvents.</b> Overall, the results reflect that those factors that indicate a higher probability of success in meeting a repayment schedule (whether through financial capacity or predisposition) underlie the decision to propose a debt agreement rather than choose bankruptcy. These factors may include residential stability, employment, higher income and asset levels, and a history of regular repayments prior to an unexpected event such as unemployment. However, research into the factors that contribute to the successful completion of Part IX agreements is still needed...|$|R
40|$|A well-functioning economy {{requires}} a well-functioning bankruptcy system. However, {{our knowledge of}} insolvency and bankruptcy is remarkably limited. This anthology brings together new international research {{from a wide range}} of academic disciplines – law, business administration, economics, history and economic history – and there is a correspondingly broad range of themes in the volume. One theme running through the book involves institutional change in the systems that have been created to deal with insolvency. How have they affected creditors and debtors? How have they affected the economy? And how have older regulations been adapted to the demands of new economic systems and organizational innovations? Another theme involves how lawmakers and people in general have explained the causes of insolvency and how they have viewed <b>insolvents.</b> In classical antiquity, insolvency was regarded as equal to theft from the creditor. That remained the dominant view for many centuries, and <b>insolvents</b> were subjected to harsh treatment. Beginning in the 19 th century, there has been a process of redefinition, and bankruptcies are no longer regarded as a consequence of moral shortcomings but simply as economic failures...|$|R
5|$|Despite {{the battle}} waged for {{possession}} of it, the railroad had not been very profitable. Passenger traffic to Wopsononock had been declining, and coal traffic from Dougherty was rather limited. Shellenberger installed a rock crusher atop the mountain, which also provided revenue. A major forest fire destroyed both the Wopsononock Hotel and the coal tipple at Dougherty on April 30, 1903. When the railroad became <b>insolvent</b> again, Shellenberger was appointed receiver on June 4, 1909. It was once more sold under foreclosure on April 30, 1910 to H.A. Davis, and reorganized as the Altoona, Juniata and Northern Railway.|$|E
5|$|During {{this entire}} period, BE1 was <b>insolvent.</b> The bank {{therefore}} {{required that the}} entire sales price of Hamar stadion be transferred to BG, even though NOK50 million {{was to go to}} the construction of Børstad Idrettspark (BIP). Therefore, Hamar Municipality decided to finance BIP to secure sufficient funding for Briskeby, essentially subsidizing Briskeby with a further NOK50 million. In 2007, BG paid NOK3.4 million in compensation to Ham-Kam for lost ticket sales during the construction time and for the club house, which would be demolished.|$|E
5|$|In 1945, SBC {{acquired}} the Basler Handelsbank (Commercial Bank of Basel), {{which was one}} of the largest banks in Switzerland, but became <b>insolvent</b> by the end of the war. SBC remained among the Swiss government's leading underwriters of debt in the post-war years. SBC, which had entered the 1950s with 31 branch offices in Switzerland and three abroad, more than doubled its assets from the end of the war to CHF 4billion by the end of the 1950s and doubled assets again in the mid-1960s, exceeding CHF 10billion by 1965.|$|E
40|$|Being in-debt is {{considered}} “normal” {{in a sense}} since we are in many ways required to become in-debt {{in order to provide}} a place to live, appliances and furniture or to get an education. Many of these necessities we pay for in retrospect. The economic system is organized around consumption both when we have and do not have money to cover the expenses. Being too much in-debt though, is not considered “normal”. Overindebtedness not only entails serious debt problems, people in this situation also experience that others perceive them as morally lacking consequently leading to feelings of shame. Through qualitative interviews with <b>insolvents</b> this report aims to provide a greater understanding for people living greatly in debt. The social and emotional realm of their situation is the focus of this research and the way they narrate their story of indebtedness to make sense of their situation. The purpose of this report is to answer the following questions: How do <b>insolvents</b> describe, explain and give meaning to their situation?; What forms of shame do these <b>insolvents</b> express and what role does shame play in how they relate to their situation?; What significance do meetings with authorities and the decision to undergo Debt Reconstruction have for their self-image and the way they deal with experiences of shame? The interviewees explain their overindebtedness as being a result of outer causes they could not foresee and therefore beyond their control not as a consequence of financial carelessness. Still, they experience different types of shame and shaming from others depending on the social relations in which shame is given and taken. Meeting authorities can either be a situation where one is shamed or one where claims of sympathy are being met. In the narratives the need for sympathy is expressed, being met with sympathy reduces the feelings of shame repairing their self-image and heals social bonds...|$|R
60|$|To such, therefore, I am so {{far from}} moving for any favour, either from the law, or from their creditors, that I think the only {{deficiency}} of the law at this time is, {{that it does not}} reach to inflict a corporal punishment in such a case, but leaves such <b>insolvents</b> to fare well, in common with those whose disasters are greater, and who, being honest and conscientious, merit more favour, but do not often find it.|$|R

5|$|It {{appeared}} {{as though the}} government might seize Lincoln for being <b>insolvent.</b> The investigation was, however, taking a long time. Keating was asking that Lincoln be given a lenient judgment by the FHLBB, {{so that it could}} limit its high risk investments and get into the safe (at the time) home mortgage business, thus allowing the business to survive. A letter from audit firm Arthur Young & Co. bolstered Keating's case that the government investigation was taking a long time. Keating now wanted the five senators to intervene with the FHLBB on his behalf.|$|E
5|$|Legislation {{began to}} address the problem from 1649 onwards, but it was slow to make a difference. Helen Small writes that, under George III (reigned 1760–1820), new {{legislation}} prevented debts of under 40shillings leading to jail (£ in 2014), but even the smallest debt would exceed that once lawyers' fees were added. Under the <b>Insolvent</b> Debtors Act 1813, debtors could request release after 14days by taking an oath that their assets did not exceed £20, but if a creditor objected they had to stay inside. Even after years in prison, the debt remained to be paid.|$|E
5|$|Northallerton Town FC {{play in the}} Northern League, {{the second}} oldest {{football}} league in the world. Formed sometime before 1895 they have been known as both Northallerton and Northallerton Alliance before settling on their current name. They are the most southerly based team in the league. The team played in many minor leagues before joining the Northern League Division Two on its formation in 1982. In 1994 the club was declared financially <b>insolvent</b> and closed down, but were rescued by local businessmen {{in time for the}} 199495 season.|$|E

No transaction can thereafter be entered into with regard to estate matters by a single creditor to the prejudice of the general body. The claim of each creditor must be dealt with as it existed at the issue of the order.” ...|$|R
40|$|This article {{takes as}} its central theme the {{development}} of insolvency law in relation to financial stability. While insolvency law does not constitute direct regulation of the financial market, it significantly affects {{the market and the}} way its participants behave. Quality insolvency law facilitates rapid exit of problem entities from the economic system and reduces the impacts of the losses incurred by <b>insolvents</b> on other businesses, households and financial institutions. Insolvency law therefore has an important role in terms of credit and systemic risk and directly affects the conditions for financial stability in the Czech economy. Moreover, it is a highly topical issue, because after many years of preparation the legislative process of adopting the new insolvency act is nearing an end...|$|R
50|$|Chemsan Suok: Rough {{translation}} {{would be}} ‘slaves due to stained sword’. Chemsan Suok, the second kind of {{slaves in the}} Chief’s house, is murderers, accidental or premeditated, and criminals who commit grave lapses that merit revenge as per the contemporary psyche. For such offenders, slavery is the salvation. Once they {{give in to the}} chief, they are saved and it is against the law to harm them. Harming them would tantamount to making a mockery of the Chief’s chair and the penalty would also be grave. Chemsan Suok also includes <b>insolvents</b> who cannot repay their debts. Chemsan Souk differs from Inpi Suok. The former do not share habitat with the chief, they are slaves by agreement with the condition that the chief is entitled to the dowry of any Chemsan Suok’s daughter.|$|R
5|$|The press {{reported}} weekly on {{the building}} of Boydell's gallery, designed by George Dance the Younger, on a site in Pall Mall. Boydell commissioned works from famous painters of the day, such as Joshua Reynolds, and the folio of engravings proved the enterprise's most lasting legacy. However, the long delay in publishing the prints and the illustrated edition prompted criticism. Because they were hurried, and many illustrations {{had to be done}} by lesser artists, the final products of Boydell's venture were judged to be disappointing. The project caused the Boydell firm to become <b>insolvent,</b> and they were forced to sell the gallery at a lottery.|$|E
5|$|The {{value of}} the Trust is {{estimated}} to have shrunk from A$1.3billion in 1991 to $138million in 2002. Nauru currently lacks money to perform many of the basic functions of government; for example, the National Bank of Nauru is <b>insolvent.</b> The CIA World Factbook estimated a GDP per capita of $5,000 in 2005. The Asian Development Bank 2007 economic report on Nauru estimated GDP per capita at $2,400 to $2,715. The United Nations (2013) estimates the GDP per capita to 15,211 and ranks it 51 on its GDP per capita country list.|$|E

Frederick the free, was so humbled, bowed, withered, and faded; William the bond, was so courtly, condescending, and benevolently conscious of a position; that in this regard only, if in no other, the brothers were a spectacle to wonder at.|$|R

5000|$|Their Lordships {{felt that}} it was clear from Lord Goff's {{formulation}} that he was making the same distinction as Lord Cranworth had made in Carron Iron between cases such as the insolvency cases, in which there is an equitable jurisdiction to enforce the statutory scheme of distribution according to its terms, and cases in which the court intervenes on the ground of vexation or oppression. The Privy Council also reflected upon its recent decision in Singularis Holdings Ltd v PriceWaterhouseCoopers where it was held that there is a broader public interest in the ability of a court exercising insolvency jurisdiction in the place of the company's incorporation to conduct an orderly winding up of its affairs on a world-wide basis, notwithstanding the territorial limits of its jurisdiction. In such cases [...] "the court is not standing on its dignity", but it intervenes because the proper distribution of the company's assets depends upon its ability to get in those assets so that comparable claims to them may be dealt with fairly in accordance with a common set of rules applying equally to all of them, and there is no jurisdiction other than that of the <b>insolvent's</b> domicile in which that result can be achieved.|$|R
