50|$|Live with Regis and Kelly: {{the show}} adopted a guest <b>host</b> <b>format</b> when either Regis Philbin or Kelly Ripa is away. Among those serving {{in that role}} have {{included}} soap opera star Susan Lucci and NASCAR driver Jeff Gordon, along with Mark Consuelos, Ripa's husband, while Joy Philbin occasionally guest hosts with her husband.|$|E
50|$|The View {{first became}} {{popular with the}} guest <b>host</b> <b>format</b> in between the arrivals and departures of the program's {{youngest}} co-hosts, Debbie Matenopoulos, Lisa Ling, and Elisabeth Hasselbeck. Although a variety of celebrities took turns in the chair, only the younger co-hosts were eligible for the job. During its tenth season, The View began featuring a guest host each day; regular Barbara Walters did not appear with nobody yet eligible to replace Star Jones, who left the previous year. Following the departure of Rosie O'Donnell in 2007 the program looked {{to return to a}} panel of five women. The moderator role was given to comedian Whoopi Goldberg in August and Jones' role was given to actress and comedian Sherri Shepherd the week following Goldberg's debut. The View used the guest <b>host</b> <b>format</b> in place of Elisabeth Hasselbeck in 2009 while she was on maternity leave.|$|E
50|$|Controlling {{the entire}} system was a small computer, {{programmed}} similarly to industrial control computers with a fixed number of tasks running all the time. The controller was also tasked with translating the data {{to and from the}} <b>host</b> <b>format.</b> IBM offered the 1367 Data Controller for Control Data systems, realizing that most users with this sort of storage need had a number of CDC machines. Other Controllers were available for different host platforms.|$|E
50|$|RDM Server is a client/server {{database}} engine with {{an optional}} configuration {{to execute the}} engine in-process with the application. When in a client/server configuration, clients perform remote procedure calls (RPC) to a server on the same computer or a computer that is visible across a network. Data is converted from the native server <b>host's</b> <b>format</b> to the native client <b>host's</b> <b>format</b> when in heterogeneous environments.|$|R
50|$|The actual Exif {{metadata}} as such may {{be carried}} within different <b>host</b> <b>formats,</b> e.g. TIFF, JFIF (JPEG) or PNG. IFF-META is another example.|$|R
5000|$|After {{succeeding}} Sikes in 1979, fellow Democrat Earl Hutto {{joined the}} program. Edwards retired from Congress in 1985, and fellow Republican Sonny Callahan succeeded him in Congress {{and on the}} program. Shortly after Lott {{was elected to the}} U.S. Senate in 1988 and Hutto retired from Congress, the program’s multiple <b>hosts</b> <b>format</b> ended, and Callahan took over as sole host. Lott and Hutto would reappear on the program during Callahan’s term in Congress.|$|R
5000|$|Fast Talk: Doug Rice {{hosts the}} show with a {{rotating}} host, usually a driver. The driver co-hosts include Kyle Petty, Jeff Hammond and Hermie Sadler. The rotating <b>host</b> <b>format</b> was adopted {{after the death of}} Benny Parsons, who had hosted the show during the first 14 seasons. It is a call-in show that airs Mondays at 7:00 p.m. Eastern time. Fast Talk is heard on 220 stations, fifty-two weeks a year. Fast Talk is also live video streamed and can be viewed at goprn.com.|$|E
5000|$|The {{addition}} of a weekly guest host was the most notable difference of season two, the only season of Mad TV to feature one. Although every season has had several guest stars, season twos guest stars were referred to as [...] "hosts" [...] and appeared in nearly every sketch. Every episode had a new host, whereas in other seasons, not every episode had a guest star and the guest star usually only appeared in a few sketches. The guest <b>host</b> <b>format</b> was similar to Saturday Night Lives, but Mad TV ended this format after season two (though later seasons do have special guest stars who appear in sketches or do monologues).|$|E
50|$|Last Call was {{originally}} to resume production for its thirteenth season in April 2013 {{but this was}} delayed and production did not begin until fall. The thirteenth season premiered in late October 2013. The show's future was uncertain, with speculation that the show may continue with another <b>host,</b> <b>format,</b> or end entirely and an initial announcement by NBC in September 2013 that Daly was leaving Last Call entirely {{in order to take}} up his new role on the Today Show. A full season of 24 original week's worth of episodes was announced, however, with Daly as host but he now only tapes opening and closing segments; interviews are now conducted by the show's producers with only the interviewee appearing on camera.|$|E
50|$|It {{was later}} retitled as Chow Time Na!, adding up April Boy Regino {{as one of}} the <b>hosts.</b> The <b>format</b> remains the same.|$|R

5000|$|On 4 April 1988 the News at 545 {{underwent}} some cosmetic changes, {{with the}} visual 'roll' logo and electronic audio being dropped {{in favour of}} a new computer-generated opening sequence and a more contemporary theme tune; the studio images were still inlaid using chromakey, although these were now also generated by computer. The programme {{was moved to the}} main newsroom within the ITN headquarters building, and full-length reports were now featured as part of the programme. ITN dispensed with the [...] "main" [...] presenter and relief <b>host</b> <b>format,</b> and instead a [...] "team" [...] of newscasters - Alastair Stewart, Fiona Armstrong, Nicholas Owen, Trevor McDonald, Sue Carpenter and Carol Barnes - began presenting the show on a [...] "rotation" [...] basis. On 13 February 1989, the introduction of a national weather forecast {{at the end of the}} programme led to the bulletin's timeslot starting earlier at 5:40pm, being extended in length and the title being changed to News at 540.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2008, RTÉ moved The Panel to its {{flagship}} {{television channel}} RTÉ One. A 14-episode run was announced, to begin airing on that channel at 22.15 on 30 October {{with a new}} presenter. Several prominent Irish broadcasters were screen-tested to fill the role of presenter, but a combination of unfortunate factors meant that show returned with rotating guest hosts, rather than any one person in a permanent position. Shortly before the airdate, RTÉ changed its schedules and the series began on 6 November at 22.15 with its original timescale of 45 minutes. Ray D'Arcy was the guest presenter for the week and {{was followed by a}} string of others including Gráinne Seoige, Dáithí Ó Sé, Marty Whelan, Charlie Bird, Phill Jupitus and Pauline McLynn. Producer Seamus Cassidy told The Irish Times that [...] ""a reasonably big name, a very big name actually" [...] would take over as permanent anchor in January 2009. On 23 November 2008, the Sunday Tribune reported that comedian Ardal O'Hanlon would be announced as the new permanent host. Former presenter Ó Briain indicated his awareness of the presenter in question, and was quoted as saying on a breakfast radio show that [...] "HE is very funny" [...] but refused to discuss the matter any further. However, in early 2009 it emerged there would be a further delay in obtaining a permanent host for [...] "at least another couple of weeks", with Craig Doyle presenting the first show of the new year. In the event, the guest <b>host</b> <b>format</b> continued for the entire 2008-2009 series. Following a short run with David McWilliams at the helm in 2009, the show was thought to have been de-commissioned. However, at the launch of RTÉ's Autumn schedule in August 2010, Craig Doyle was announced as presenter for a new run of 14 shows.|$|E
40|$|The Wayne State University Press Journals program {{comprises}} ten scholarly print serials. When the Press {{sought to}} deliver its journals electronically, in-house, {{for the first}} time, it established a mutually beneficial collaboration with the Libraries to <b>host,</b> <b>format,</b> manage and preserve its content online.

40|$|This thesis studies issues {{introduced}} by supporting multithreaded computing in environments composed of workers heterogeneous {{with respect to}} data representation, speed, and scale. We implement a heterogeneous multithreaded runtime system, and prove its efficiency. We present an implementation of Cilk that supports execution in heterogeneous environments. To support communication between workers with different data representations, we propose two mechanisms. The first mechanism translates messages to a canonical form on transmission and to the native <b>host</b> <b>format</b> on reception. The second mechanism generates signature tables of structures that are communicated between the workers to guide translation. We propose but do not implement an extension to generate signature tables for all C functions so that functions can be passed as messages. We prove the following: for a fully strict Cilk program with T 1 total work and a critical path of length T, running on P workers with a maximum commu [...] ...|$|E
40|$|The Distributed Table Manager (DTM) is a {{fast and}} {{efficient}} utility for distributing named binary data structures called Tables, of arbitrary size and structure, around a heterogeneous network of computers {{to a set}} of registered clients. The Tables are transmitted over a UDP network between DTM servers in network format, where the servers perform the conversions to and from <b>host</b> <b>format</b> for local clients. The servers provide clients with synchronization mechanisms, a choice of network data flows, and table options such as keeping table disc copies, shared memory or heap memory table allocation, table read/write permissions, and table subnet broadcasting. DTM has been designed to be easily maintainable, and to automatically recover from the type of errors typically encountered in a large control system network. The DTM system is based on a three level server daemon hierarchy, in which an inter daemon protocol handles network failures, and incorporates recovery procedures which will guarantee table consistency when communications are re-established. These protocols are implemented over a communications layer which performs the data conversions, packet splitting, error-correction with retry, and time out handling. The same communications layer is used to implement the application program interface which calls on the server daemon for client services. DTM is a registration based system, in which communications are established dynamically as needed, and tables are distributed only to the clients who have registered their interest in them. The registration protocols include mechanisms to recover from daemon re-launches, and clean up after aborted clients...|$|E
50|$|To use a SAN disk, the <b>host</b> must <b>format</b> {{it with a}} filesystem. Unlike a SATA or SCSI disk, however, a SAN {{hard drive}} may be {{accessed}} by multiple machines. This {{is a source of}} both danger and opportunity.|$|R
50|$|In April 2007, CBS {{announced}} plans for a semi-revival of this show titled Do You Trust Me? with commentator Tucker Carlson as <b>host.</b> The <b>format</b> was designed to test how well total strangers would work together. Ultimately, the series never aired.|$|R

25|$|The station's news {{broadcasts}} – which originally aired only in {{the evening}} until the launch of a midday newscast in 1972 – began implementing a <b>hosted</b> <b>format</b> in 1967, when Bob Schieffer and Russ Bloxom joined the station as anchors for The Texas News, appearing on camera ahead of and after the newsreel segments. The program officially converted to a live-on-tape broadcast on August 1, 1969. Concurrent with the station's move to The Studios at DFW, KXAS donated its collection of news footage shot for The Texas News from the 1950s through the 1970s to the University of North Texas Libraries in Denton in November 2013; the film reels and accompanying script images were digitized by the university for availability to the public via the library's digital preservation network.|$|R

50|$|The {{starting}} point for host-to-host communication on the ARPANET in 1969 was the 1822 protocol, which defined the transmission of messages to an IMP. The message format was designed to work unambiguously with {{a broad range of}} computer architectures. An 1822 message essentially consisted of a message type, a numeric host address, and a data field. To send a data message to another host, the transmitting <b>host</b> <b>formatted</b> a data message containing the destination host's address and the data message being sent, and then transmitted the message through the 1822 hardware interface. The IMP then delivered the message to its destination address, either by delivering it to a locally connected host, or by delivering it to another IMP. When the message was ultimately delivered to the destination host, the receiving IMP would transmit a Ready for Next Message (RFNM) acknowledgement to the sending, host IMP.|$|R
