[...] "Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful," [...] said Michele, [...] "and when I {{was in high school}} it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. What's so great about Glee is that <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be." ...|$|E

She has explained, [...] " [...] is shady, but you still love her. She's still vulnerable. That's what I try to do with Rachel. Rachel will never be popular because her looks aren't considered beautiful, and when I {{was in high school}} it was the same for me. I didn't get a nose job, and every single girl around me did. Therefore, I was out. I was not cool. What's so great about Glee is that <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> how that kind of stuff hurts, but it doesn't matter: You can still be who you want to be.

500|$|Peggy and Frank {{were married}} {{on-screen}} on 1 April 1999. A [...] "hen night" [...] was thrown for Windsor with the show's make-up team, and the BBC threw a [...] "massive" [...] {{party in the}} show's Albert Square to celebrate the event. Actors Windsor and Reid joined fellow stars, celebrities and TV executives for a celebration on the programme's set in Elstree, Hertfordshire. Windsor admitted {{she had been so}} nervous before filming the wedding she was sick on set. She commented, [...] "I broke out in spots and threw up in the vestry. I was very nervous – we were both very nervous. The day you stop getting nervous you can hold your hands up. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> care." [...] The soap wedding was filmed in Harrow, North West London in February 1999. A BBC spokesman commented: [...] "It {{is one of the best}} weddings Walford has ever seen but it is not problem free. There are a lot of people who do not want to see Frank and Peggy married – Grant being one of them – and it remains to be seen whether they will get through the day without a major upset. And as if the wedding is not gripping enough, there are certainly shocking revelations back at the Vic." [...] In the eventual episode, it was actually Grant Mitchell who persuaded his mother to marry Frank – with whom he had been feuding following his accidental killing of wife Tiffany – after Peggy was having second thoughts, thinking that Frank was only marrying her out of pity. Nearly 20 million viewers watched Peggy and Frank marry.|$|E

2500|$|David O. Selznick signed Hitchcock to {{a seven-year}} {{contract}} beginning in March 1939, {{and set to}} end in 1946, which brought the Hitchcocks to Hollywood. The suspense and the gallows humour that had become Hitchcock's trademark in his films continued to appear in his American productions. The working arrangements with Selznick were less than ideal. Selznick suffered from constant financial problems, and Hitchcock was often displeased with Selznick's creative control over his films. In a later interview, Hitchcock commented, [...] " [...] was the Big Producer. ... Producer was king, The most flattering thing Mr. Selznick ever said about me—and <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> the amount of control—he said I was the 'only director' he'd 'trust with a film'." ...|$|E
2500|$|At {{the end of}} the 2009–10 season, Bryson {{was linked}} with a move to Hearts, who were managed by Jim Jefferies, who had signed Bryson when he was manager of Kilmarnock. Bryson said: [...] "we'll wait and see if {{anything}} materialises over the summer. Jim Jefferies signed me from Clyde and gave me my chance in the SPL and I'm grateful to him for that. I enjoyed working under him at Kilmarnock and wouldn't mind working under him again. Every player has ambitions to play at the highest level and I'm no different so we'll just wait and see if an offer comes in but I'm happy at Killie just now." [...] Hearts were prepared to offer £300,000 but Kilmarnock valued Bryson at closer to £500,000 and talks between the two clubs collapsed. Hearts turned their attention to their former midfielder Paul Hartley, whose contract with English Championship club Bristol City was about to expire. However, they dropped their interest in Hartley after he refused to distance himself from criticism of Hearts' majority shareholder Vladimir Romanov during his first stint with the club. Hearts thus turned their attention back to Bryson and gave Kilmarnock a final [...] "take-it-or-leave-it" [...] offer, which included a [...] "significant sell-on clause" [...] but not an increased transfer fee. The offer was rejected. Hearts returned with two more bids on transfer deadline day, which were also rejected. Bryson said that he was [...] "relieved the window has now closed... It's nice that other clubs want you, <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> must be doing well, but it's not to be just now and I'll carry on doing well for Kilmarnock." ...|$|E

6000|$|... "Nay, friend," [...] he said, [...] "I'll not do that. Thy {{friendship}} is too precious a guerdon that I should jeopardise <b>it</b> by <b>showing</b> <b>thee</b> {{the blackness of}} my soul." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "I am. It {{seems to}} me I sized you up {{correctly}} quite a while ago, and you have had about enough claim-jumping. Now, I don't know that I blame you, and, anyway, if you had very little sense, <b>it</b> <b>showed</b> <b>you</b> had some grit. As the mining laws stand, it's a legitimate occupation, {{and you tell me}} you only figured on getting your dollars back. Well, if you want them, you can work for them at a reasonable salary." ...|$|R

60|$|Sometimes {{he would}} speak of her by that name. <b>It</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> how {{the idea was}} {{embedded}} in his mind, and how real it was to him. The world has called our kings by it, but I know of none of them who has had so good a right as she to that sublime title.|$|E

6000|$|THE GENERAL. But, my dear Lesbia, you {{see what}} has {{happened}} here to-day. [Coming a little nearer and bending his face towards hers] Now I put it to <b>you,</b> does <b>it</b> not <b>show</b> <b>you</b> the folly of not marrying? ...|$|R

6000|$|... "I {{know nothing}} about it," [...] said the Doctor, [...] "and I don't WANT to know. I {{attended}} him for a broken finger--Married and Single cricket match--and that's when I struck the nonsense. That's all.

6000|$|... 'I should beg {{you not to}} do so, {{but that}} <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> to such admirable advantage,' he replied with earnestness. 'Forgive me; I could not help saying that.

6000|$|... "I {{thank you}} for saying that; <b>it</b> <b>shows</b> <b>you</b> don't regard me as a stranger.

6000|$|To Joan of Arc, the peasant-girl, Charles VII. was no King {{until he}} was crowned; to her he was only the Dauphin; that is to say, the heir.
