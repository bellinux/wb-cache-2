The plan works and Tommy knocks out Kane in round seven. After the fight Marty plans to take <b>everyone</b> <b>out</b> for a celebratory dinner but Bob Silver (Paul Raci), a big-time promoter, has watched the fight and, impressed, invites them all out. Marty declines and goes home, but later that night is taken to the hospital. Tommy rushes {{to the hospital and}} finds Diane there. He asks if Marty is in the hospital because of what happened at the cabin. Diane tells him that when Marty was a fighter, people threatened to expose Marty's homosexuality, so he ended his career by putting his hand through a window and damaging it. He became a teacher and his influence led Diane to make herself a success. When Marty is released, Tommy moves in with him temporarily to help him recuperate.|$|E
5|$|Silver Reef's {{residents}} {{rebuilt the}} businesses {{that had been}} destroyed, but the town soon began to decline. In 1881, the Stormont Mining Company and the Barbee & Walker Mining Company had to decrease wages from $4 per day to $3.50 per day in all of their mines except the Savage mine (a Stormont property). In response to the decrease in wages, the Silver Reef Miners Union was formed. In February 1881, union members began talking about striking the mines, and as word of this potential strike spread, the Stormont Mining Company discharged those of its miners {{who were part of}} the Miners Union. In response, the discharged union members escorted the company's superintendent, Washington Allen, out of Silver Reef. Allen immediately went to the Second District Court in Beaver and filed a lawsuit against the union members. Before they went to court, the union members held a meeting and decided to shut down the Savage mine. Led by Matthew O'Loughlin, the president of the Silver Reef Miners Union, they walked through Silver Reef in rows of two, and, upon arriving at the Savage mine, O'Loughlin and nine other men went into the hoisting works and ordered the engineer on duty to shut down the pumps that kept water from the water table out of the mine. After the pumps were shut down, the group of ten went into the Savage mine and ordered <b>everyone</b> <b>out.</b>|$|E

Fed up with the chaos, Liz sends the entire show's staff—including Kenneth and Dr. Spaceman—to her office. Liz ponders over a box of matches and thinks of the woman in court, in which she admitted to committing arson as a way of getting back at her out-of-control employees.

500|$|Some of {{the staff}} were tired of the delays—Duke Nukem Forever was the only 3D game many had worked on, giving them little {{to put on a}} resume, and as much of 3D Realms' payment hinged on {{profit-sharing}} after release, the continual delays meant deferred income. By August 2006, between 7–10 employees had left since 2005, a majority of the Duke Nukem Forever team (which in recent months had shrunk to around 18 staff). While Shacknews speculated that the departures would lead to further delays, 3D Realms denied the claims, stating that the employees had left over a number of months and that the game was still moving ahead. Creative director Raphael van Lierop, hired in 2007, played through the completed content and realized that there was more finished than he expected. Lierop told Broussard that he felt they could push the game and [...] "blow <b>everyone</b> <b>out</b> of the water", but Broussard responded that the game was still two years away from completion.|$|E

500|$|In January 1980, the {{producers}} and writers began plotting the culminating episodes for season 3. Executive producer Philip Capice says {{they decided to}} attempt {{to work in a}} ploy to hold interest over the summer. CBS ordered two extra episodes, which gave them a chance to weave many storylines into the scripts. He noted that [...] "J.R. had developed into a character we felt <b>everyone</b> <b>out</b> there wanted to see get his comeuppance. And we did need that sort of a cliffhanger to carry us over to the new season." [...] He said that there was consensus that a mystery with several suspects was optimal and that it should be a sudden event. Capice denied rumors that the shooting was a ploy to make it easy to write Hagman out of the script if his contract negotiations became too difficult. Producer Leonard Katzman, executive story consultant Art Lewis and story editor Camille Marchetta decided the actual culprit in mid-March by process of logical elimination with the belief that the audience should not be surprised by someone who was not important to the show as the shooter.|$|E

Chef and the children make it {{for the end of the}} fight and offer Jesus some words of encouragement. Inspired, Jesus finally throws a single weak punch. However, Satan then takes a dive and goes down for the count. Afterward, Satan reveals that his plan had, in fact, been to bet on Jesus and then throw the fight, winning him a lot of money and real estate from the South Park residents. The townspeople are angered by this, until Stan reminds them that Jesus told them not to bet on Satan. The whole town then asks forgiveness of Jesus, who accepts the apology. Kenny dies when Jimbo identifies him as a rare duck-billed platypus and shoots him. Damien bids goodbye to Stan and Kyle since his dad [...] "is always on the move" [...] he has to leave.

500|$|The {{episode was}} devised {{following}} a lecture given by writer Mike Bullen {{and executive producer}} Andy Harries at the Screen Producers Association of Australia conference in November 2000. Bullen and Harries already knew that actress Fay Ripley {{did not want to}} renew her contract to play Jenny Gifford for the whole fourth series, so developed a storyline where Jenny's ex-husband Pete would meet and fall in love with an Australian woman after his divorce. The storyline would culminate in an episode set in Australia, which Harries wanted [...] "for no desperately good reason except that it's a nice place to go". The storyline was plotted and Kimberley Joseph was cast as Jo Ellison, who makes her first appearance in Series 4, Episode 1. As originally planned, the fourth series would have depicted all of the main characters permanently emigrating to Australia; Bullen said, [...] "One of them , whose relationship is no more, meets an Australian in England and he comes out here, and the notion is that the others follow. Then one of the others would have a reason for wanting to walk away from his life so he comes out here too. That's really an excuse to bring <b>everyone</b> <b>out,</b> and the final episode would be a 90-minute special looking back on their lives up to that point; because it would be the last episode with these characters." [...] Having the characters permanently based in Australia opened up the possibility of spin-off series set in the country. The direction of the fourth series, and thus the finale, changed significantly when Helen Baxendale announced that she was pregnant.|$|E
500|$|After weak {{sales in}} 2009 of several {{titles in the}} Guitar Hero series, Activision {{proceeded}} to make several changes with their internal development teams. The company dissolved RedOctane, bringing {{in some of the}} staff directly into Activision. Activision further shuttered Neversoft's Guitar Hero division, pending the completion of Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, with further development in the series to be created by some former Neversoft members and Vicarious Visions. Brian Bright, former Neversoft member and current project lead, noted that part of the poor sales of Guitar Hero in 2009 was a result of a loss of focus with Guitar Hero 5, stating that [...] "we were trying to please <b>everyone</b> <b>out</b> there and I think in the end you end up not pleasing any one person a lot". With Guitar Hero: Warriors of Rock, Bright wanted to bring the game back to please the fans of the earlier Guitar Hero games, specifically the highly successful [...] To that end, the team developed a soundtrack [...] "more focused on rock 'n' roll" [...] than the variety of genres within Guitar Hero 5. The songs are more guitar-centric, as proven to be the most popular instrument choice based on Guitar Hero 5. Bright noted they used player statistics from previous games to shape Warriors of Rock; for example, according to Bright, within a month of release, 40% of the players of Guitar Hero 5 were playing on Expert mode, and felt this was the audience they needed to cater to. Bright also stated that the aim of Warriors of Rock was to create a game with [...] "its own identity" [...] from both previous Guitar Hero titles and other rhythm games; [...] "Rather than go head-to-head with our own games and our competitors, we decided we wanted to make something different." ...|$|E
