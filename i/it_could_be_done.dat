Student replied that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> but only by 12 aircraft and in daylight; this would deliver 80–90 paratroopers onto the target.|$|E
5|$|The {{proposal}} for {{a new type of}} submarine to replace the Oberon class of diesel-electric submarines began in July 1978, when the RAN director of submarine policy prepared a paper detailing the need to start considering a replacement for the ageing Oberons. The paper also raised the suggestion {{that the majority of the}} submarines be constructed in Australia and that the number of submarines be increased beyond the six Oberons. Building the submarines in Australia was initially met with reactions predicting an impossible task because of the poor state of the Australian shipbuilding industry, and Australian industry in general, although campaigning by several figures in Australian industry who thought <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> came to the attention of those spearheading the project to design the Oberon-class replacement, and led to the view that it was both possible and feasible. The campaign to build submarines in Australia was also met with support from the Australian Labor Party and several trade unions.|$|E

25|$|Parrish's {{concern for}} the {{environment}} dates back to the 1950s when Los Angeles’ severe smog, and the reason for it, worried her.

Air Force flight surgeons were assigned to Maxwell Air Force Base in Montgomery, Alabama, located across town from Maxwell AFB at the Dannelly Field Air National Guard Base at Dannelly Field airport, where Bush was paid for drilling in October and November 1972 and in January 1973, his only drilling dates between April 1972 and April 1973.|$|E

25|$|On {{the same}} year before the {{completion}} of the Main Ring, Wilson testified to the Joint Committee on Atomic Energy on March 9, 1971 that it was feasible to achieve a higher energy by using superconducting magnets. He also suggested that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> by using the same tunnel as the main ring and the new magnets would be installed in the same locations to be operated in parallel to the existing magnets of the Main Ring. That was the starting point of the Tevatron project. The Tevatron was in research and development phase between 1973 and 1979 while the acceleration at the Main Ring continued to be enhanced.|$|E
25|$|Pratt {{believed}} that Native Americans were the equals of whites, and founded Carlisle to immerse {{their children in}} white culture and teach them English, new skills and customs, {{in order to help}} them survive. After the end of Great Sioux War in 1877, the Lakota people were impoverished, harassed and confined to a reservation. At the time, many people believed Native Americans were a vanishing race whose only hope for survival was rapid cultural transformation. The U.S. government urgently sought a progressive educational model to rapidly assimilate Indians into white culture. Whether this could be achieved and how rapidly <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> was unknown. Pratt believed he could make use of the Carlisle facility. He thought its proximity to officials in Washington, D.C. would help him educate officials about the Indian capacity for learning.|$|E
25|$|In 1989 {{seven out}} of ten SANFL clubs were {{recording}} losses and the combined income of the SANFL and WAFL had dropped to 40% of that of the VFL. During early 1990 the SANFL decided to wait three years before making any further decision in regards to fielding a South Australian side in the VFL until <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> without negatively affecting football within the state. Frustrated with lack of progress, Port Adelaide were having secret negotiations {{in the town of}} Quorn for entry in 1991. From these discussions Port Adelaide Football Club accepted an invitation from the VFL to join what had now become the AFL. The AFL signed a Heads of Agreement with the club in expectation that Port would enter the competition in 1991, meaning the Port Adelaide Football Club would field two teams, one in the AFL and one in the SANFL.|$|E

500|$|Electroplating used one-thousandth of the nickel {{of a solid}} nickel diffuser. The SAM {{laboratories}} {{had already}} attempted this and failed. Heussner experimented with a prototype in a building built within a building, and found that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done,</b> {{so long as the}} series of pickling and scaling steps required were done without anything coming in contact with oxygen. Chrysler's entire factory at Lynch Road in Detroit was turned over to the manufacture of diffusers.

500|$|However, others {{noted that}} if Disney had {{attempted}} to block the film's release, it was unclear on what legal grounds <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done.</b> Moore took care to avoid direct copyright infringement of songs or films played as part of attractions, and intellectual property law is less clear on the {{other aspects of the}} film. Science fiction writer Cory Doctorow, who distributed his first novel, Down and Out in the Magic Kingdom, set in a 22nd-century Disney World, under a Creative Commons license, believes there's at most [...] "a possible trademark claim, and I suppose that Disney could conceivabl bring suit for violating the park's terms of use, but these are much harder cases to make than copyright." ...|$|E
500|$|Fincher had {{previously}} worked with director of photography Harris Savides on Seven (he shot the opening credits) and The Game. Savides loved the script but realized, [...] "there {{was so much}} exposition, just people {{talking on the phone}} or having conversations. It was difficult to imagine how <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> in a visual way." [...] Fincher and Savides did not want to repeat the look of Seven. The director's approach to Zodiac was to create a look mundane enough that audiences would accept that what they were watching was the truth. The filmmakers also did not want to glamorize the killer or tell the story through his eyes. [...] "That would have turned the story into a first-person-shooter video game. We didn't want to make the sort of movie that serial killers would want to own," [...] Fincher said.|$|E
500|$|However, Burton {{dropped out}} of Mary Reilly over Columbia's {{decision}} to fast track the film and their interest with Julia Roberts {{in the title role}} instead of Ryder. This prompted Burton to becoming interested in directing Ed Wood himself, on the understanding <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> quickly. Lehmann said, [...] "Tim wanted to do this movie immediately and direct, but I was already committed to Airheads." [...] Lehmann was given executive producer credit. Alexander and Karaszewski delivered a 147-page screenplay in six weeks. Burton read the first draft and immediately agreed to direct the film as it stood, without any changes or rewrites. Ed Wood gave Burton the opportunity to make a film that was more character-driven as opposed to style-driven. He said in an interview, [...] "On a picture like this I find you don't need to storyboard. You're working mainly with actors, and there's no effects going on, so it's best to be more spontaneous." ...|$|E
50|$|The {{question}} about {{the creation of the}} Chuvash State University was raised again in 1958-1959, but even then <b>it</b> <b>could</b> not <b>be</b> <b>done</b> because of many problems connected with the absence of the material base and lack of scientific staff in the republic.|$|R

500|$|Just {{before the}} dedication, the slogan [...] "Quebec Libre" [...] (a {{reference}} to the Quebec sovereignty movement) was painted on the fountain at night, and the graffiti was erased. During the dedication, attended by Thomas Hoving, director of New York's Metropolitan Museum of Art, a rock band played, and Armand Vaillancourt himself painted [...] "Quebec Libre" [...] on the fountain in as many places as he could reach. A redevelopment agency employee started to paint over the slogans during the ceremony, but Herman stopped him, saying <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> later. When asked about why he defaced his own fountain with graffiti he responded, “No, no. It's a joy to make a free statement. This fountain is dedicated to all freedom. Free Quebec! Free East Pakistan! Free Viet Nam! Free the whole world!” Vaillancourt said his actions were [...] "a powerful performance" [...] intended to illustrate the notion of power to the people.

500|$|Vig started doubting <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> fully analog {{once the}} tapes {{for the first}} song recorded, [...] "Miss the Misery", started falling apart, but Grohl {{reassured}} him [...] "no, Butch, I don't want any computer in this house at all." [...] The producer said that during recording he [...] "had to force my brain to fire different synapses" [...] to remember {{how to deal with}} the analog equipment and the lack of a digital display. One of the habits Vig had to call back was editing using a razor blade—"I used to be able to do 20 edits in half an hour if need be. It took me about 20 minutes to do the first edit!"—a technique he employed for the first songs recorded. Eventually he gave up and decided to punch in and punch out tapes instead, as the process was time-consuming and a more editable tape sent to Vig from Smart Studios was mostly ruined by one of Grohl's daughters. While many recordings had inserts and some parts rerecorded, the only song that had to be redone from scratch was [...] "I Should Have Known", as Grohl felt Vig was [...] "trying to make this into a radio single" [...] when the singer wanted it [...] "to sound really raw and primal".|$|E
500|$|William Wellesley-Pole, {{elder brother}} of the Duke of Wellington (the victor at Waterloo) and the Master of the Mint, in 1819 {{instructed}} Benedetto Pistrucci to engrave Flaxman's work to make steel dies for the medal. [...] Pistrucci, an Italian {{who had come to}} Britain in 1815, was performing the duties of Chief Engraver of the Royal Mint. He believed he had been promised the title, which as a foreigner he was ineligible for, and this would be a longtime grievance for him. Pistrucci refused to engrave Flaxman's model, unwilling to copy the work of another artist. This refusal angered the Royal Academy. Pole instead asked Pistrucci to prepare a design of his own, and in a day he had produced wax models, about which the Prince Regent was enthusiastic. In August 1819, Pole received instructions from the Treasury to employ Pistrucci to produce the medal. The fee was £2,400, to be paid in instalments. [...] Pole promised an advance that would allow Pistrucci to bring his family from Rome. According to Carlo Milano in his article on Pistrucci for the Royal Mint, [...] "The Waterloo Medal could not be compared to any previous medal: it was much bigger and its iconography more complicated than had ever been seen before in the history of medallic art. But Pistrucci believed that <b>it</b> <b>could</b> <b>be</b> <b>done</b> and immediately began to work." ...|$|E
