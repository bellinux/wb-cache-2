25|$|Fred's remarkably relaxed, emotionally sterile {{attitude}} towards {{all aspects of}} his crimes had startled {{many members of the}} enquiry team.

Through analysing Fred's conduct throughout the extensive 1994 interviews, this psychologist, Paul Britton, advised Superintendent Bennett that Fred's blasé manner indicated he had committed so many offences over such {{a long period of time}} that he was now indifferent to the acts of torture, mutilation and murder. Britton added that although an offender of this nature may come to offend less frequently, he would be unlikely to cease killing altogether.|$|E

25|$|Dorothy Robinson {{reviewed}} {{data from}} jurisdictions where helmet use increased following legislation, {{and concluded that}} helmet laws did not demonstrably reduce cyclists' head injuries. Mayer Hillman, a transport and road safety analyst from the UK, {{does not support the}} use of helmets, reasoning that they are of very limited value {{in the event of a}} collision with a car, that risk compensation negates their protective effect and because he feels their promotion implicitly shifts responsibility of care to the cyclist. He also cautions against placing the recommendations of surgeons above other <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> in the debate, comparing it to drawing conclusions on whether it is worthwhile to buy lottery tickets by sampling only a group of prizewinners. The prominent UK-based cycling activist John Franklin is skeptical of the merits of helmets, regarding proactive measures including bike maintenance and riding skills as being more important. Cyclists' representative groups complain that focus on helmets diverts attention from other issues which are much more important for improving bicycle safety, such as road danger reduction, training, roadcraft, and bicycle maintenance.|$|E

500|$|Gardner and Doyle {{sought a}} second <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> from the {{photographic}} company Kodak. Several of the company's technicians examined the enhanced prints, {{and although they}} agreed with Snelling that the pictures [...] "showed no signs of being faked", they concluded that [...] "this could not be taken as conclusive evidence... that they were authentic photographs of fairies". Kodak declined to issue a certificate of authenticity. Gardner believed that the Kodak technicians might not have examined the photographs entirely objectively, observing that one had commented [...] "after all, as fairies couldn't be true, the photographs must have been faked somehow". The prints were also examined by another photographic company, Ilford, who reported unequivocally that there was [...] "some evidence of faking". Gardner and Doyle, perhaps rather optimistically, interpreted {{the results of the}} three expert evaluations as two in favour of the photographs' authenticity and one against.|$|E
500|$|Because Trott's illness precluded his {{selection}} for the 1899 Australian team to England, the Australian captaincy passed to Joe Darling. On 8 May 1899, Trott {{was committed to}} the Kew Asylum, a psychiatric hospital in the eastern suburbs of Melbourne. [...] The facility opened in 1871 during an era when large asylums were in vogue. [...] By the time of Trott's admission, <b>expert</b> <b>opinion</b> had changed; in January 1898 The Argus reported a specialist's claim that the asylum was likely to make a patient, [...] "just mad enough to be put under restraint"—that is, worse rather than better. Trott was recorded as suffering [...] "dementia" [...] and [...] "alcoholism", although there is little empirical evidence for either diagnosis. [...] Cricket writer Gideon Haigh suggests that his symptoms would possibly be identified in modern times as depressive psychosis and treated with antipsychotics or electroconvulsive therapy.|$|E
