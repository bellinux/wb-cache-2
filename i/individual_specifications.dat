50|$|The facet {{language}} defines <b>individual</b> <b>specifications</b> and specification composition {{to define}} systems. Facets and components define system models from one engineering perspective. Each facet is written by extending a domain that provides vocabulary and semantics for the model. Facets {{are defined by}} declaring items and defining properties for those items. As such, Rosetta is a declarative language and constructs cannot be guaranteed to evaluate to a value, although some facets can be evaluated. Using the design abstractions provided by its domain, a facet describes requirements, behavior, constraints, or function of a system. Facets are heterogeneous and may be defined using any of the predefined or user defined domains. The Rosetta semantics denotes each facet to a coalgebra that defines its model-of-computation. Because Rosetta is reflective, facets can be composed and transformed to define complex systems. A common specification technique is to write facets for different aspects of a system and then compose those aspects using product and sum operations to define the complete system.|$|E

50|$|By {{separating}} {{mechanism and}} policy, RINA dramatically simplifies networking. There {{is no longer}} a different set of modules and protocols for each capability in each layer. Instead, the elements of the DIF combine to accomplish functions that have previously required a multitude of <b>individual</b> <b>specifications.</b> The implications of this are signiﬁcant: rather than hundreds of handcrafted protocols each with their own optimizations, there is a consistent repeating structure of two protocols (an application protocol, a data transfer protocol) and a common header and roughly a half dozen modules. In this approach there is thus far less to go wrong. A single replicable layer of a half dozen or so modules can be much more effectively engineered to be free of bugs and security holes than the literally hundreds of protocols in conventional Internetworking. Furthermore, the inherently constrained nature of policies makes it possible to circumscribe their side effects and ensure their proper behaviour. It is possible to deﬁne properties of policies that can be proved or tested that ensure proper behaviour.|$|E
5000|$|The {{specifications}} {{drawn up}} in 1924 by the Committee for the Safety of Airships had based weight estimates on the then existing rules for airframe strengths. However, the Air Ministry Inspectorate {{introduced a new}} set of rules for airship safety standards in late 1924 and compliance with these as-yet unformulated rules had been explicitly mentioned in the <b>individual</b> <b>specifications</b> for each airship. [...] These new rules called for all lifting loads to be transmitted directly to the transverse frames rather than being taken via the longitudinal girders. The intention behind this ruling was to enable the stressing of the framework to be fully calculated, rather than relying on empirically accumulated data, as was contemporary practice at the Zeppelin design office. Apart from the implications for the airframe weight, one effect of these regulations was to force both teams to contrive a new system of harnessing the gasbags. R101's patented [...] "parachute" [...] gasbag harnessing, designed by Michael Rope, proved less than satisfactory, permitting the gas bags to surge unduly, particularly in rough weather. [...] This caused the gasbags to chafe against the structure, causing holes in the fabric. Another effect was that both R100 and R101 had {{a relatively small number of}} longitudinal girders in order to simplify the stressing calculations.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. Heterogeneous {{specification}} {{becomes more}} and more important because complex systems are often specified using multiple viewpoints, involving multiple formalisms. Moreover, a formal software development process may lead to a change of formalism during the development. However, current research in integrated formal methods only deals with ad-hoc integrations of different formalisms. The heterogeneous tool set (Hets) is a parsing, static analysis and proof management tool combining various such tools for <b>individual</b> <b>specification</b> languages, thus providing a tool for heterogeneous multi-logic specification. Hets is based on a graph of logics and languages (formalized as so-called institutions), their tools, and their translations. This provides a clean semantics of heterogeneous specification, as well as a corresponding proof calculus. For proof management, the calculus of development graphs (known from other large-scale proof management systems) has been adapted to heterogeneous specification. Development graphs provide an overview of the (heterogeneous) specification module hierarchy and the current proof state, and thus may be used for monitoring the overall correctness of a heterogeneous development. ...|$|R

40|$|Abstract: Purpose: This is an analytical-descriptive study {{aimed at}} {{analyzing}} <b>individual</b> <b>specifications</b> of addicts {{who have gone}} to treatment centers of Tehran in the year 2006. Materials and Methods: Investigation members were all addicts admitted to treatment centers of Tehran, investigation method was random sampling, investigation place was rehabilitating drug addicts and NGOs, the number of all members was 256 and input assembling instrument was questionnaires comprising Demography and MMPI questionnaire. The results are derived from descriptive and deductive statistics and are analyzed by SPSS software. Results: The results demonstrate the fact that 19. 1 % of addicts are jobless, 38 % are lessees, 2. 3 % are illiterate, 60. 5 % are single and 57. 8 % of them have an income of less than 2, 000, 000 Rials, reflecting the fact that unemployment has no relation with the tendency to addiction- Even those with high economic and educational position have a great tendency to addiction mirroring the failure of society’s supporting. Based upon MMPI, the amount of exposition to danger in addicts consists of 7. 81 % in mania, 28. 12 % SC, 12. 5 % in paranoia, and 33. 98 % in unsociability, 12. 5 % mysterious, 57. 42 % in depression and 22. 26 in self-assumption of illness, reflecting disorder in their personality. Conclusion: So, according to MPI, if the results of D, PD and SC in addicts are high and the L and K rates are low, treatment and consulting service is advised.

The process specifications define how individual processes communicate with other coupled processes. We show the advantages of χ for coordinating the ATC process by means of an illustrative example, and demonstrate that different coordination strategies can be implemented and evaluated efficiently. ...|$|E
