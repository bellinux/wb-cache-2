5|$|The Protestants {{were another}} group that began {{settling}} in Brazil {{at the beginning}} of the 19th century. The first Protestants were English, and an Anglican church was opened in Rio de Janeiro in 1820. Others were established afterwards in São Paulo, Pernambuco and Bahia provinces. They were followed by German and Swiss Lutherans who settled in the South and Southwest regions and built their own <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>worship.</b> Following the U.S. Civil War in the 1860s, immigrants from the southern United States seeking to escape Reconstruction settled in São Paulo. Several American churches sponsored missionary activities, including Baptists, Lutherans, Congregationalists and Methodists.|$|E
5|$|With the {{annexation}} of Jerusalem by Egypt in 1831, a new opportunity arose for the Perushim. They petitioned Muhammad Ali regarding {{the rebuilding of}} the synagogue, but concerns about deviating from longstanding Muslim tradition and the Pact of Umar (which restricted the repair or construction of non-Muslim <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>worship)</b> meant permission was not forthcoming. However, {{five months after the}} earthquake of May 1834, the prohibition was relaxed and the Sephardim were allowed to carry out repair works to their existing synagogues. This consent gave rise to further efforts by the Ashkenazim to receive authorisation to rebuild theirs.|$|E

Furthermore, no sermons can be delivered, and there can be no ritualistic ceremonies practised.|$|E
5|$|Shortly after Aguayo {{returned}} to Mexico, the new viceroy of New Spain, Juan de Acuña, marqués de Casafuerte, {{was ordered to}} cut costs accrued {{for the defense of}} {{the northern part of the}} territory. Acuña appointed Colonel Pedro de Rivera y Villalón to inspect the entire northern frontier. Beginning in what is now California in November 1724, Rivera spent the next three years inspecting the northern frontier, reaching San Antonio in August 1727. His reports of Los Adaes, Presidio Nuestra Señora de Loreto, and the presidio at San Antonio were favorable, but he was unimpressed with Presidio de los Tejas, whose 25soldiers were guarding empty missions. The native population had refused to congregate into communities around the missions and refused baptism unless they were on the brink of death. Because the Indians were well-armed, the Franciscans were unable to compel them to join the missions. The frustrated missionaries finally petitioned the Spanish government for 50soldiers to burn the Indians' <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>worship</b> and force them to build homes near the missions. No troops were forthcoming.|$|E
5|$|The pharaoh was the {{absolute}} monarch {{of the country}} and, at least in theory, wielded complete control {{of the land and}} its resources. The king was the supreme military commander and head of the government, who relied on a bureaucracy of officials to manage his affairs. In charge of the administration was his second in command, the vizier, who acted as the king's representative and coordinated land surveys, the treasury, building projects, the legal system, and the archives. At a regional level, the country was divided into as many as 42 administrative regions called nomes each governed by a nomarch, who was accountable to the vizier for his jurisdiction. The temples formed the backbone of the economy. Not only were they <b>houses</b> <b>of</b> <b>worship,</b> but were also responsible for collecting and storing the nation's wealth in a system of granaries and treasuries administered by overseers, who redistributed grain and goods.|$|E
