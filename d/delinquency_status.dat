40|$|The {{capability}} for mortgage guaranty {{insurance companies to}} establish loss reserves conditioned on a dynamic risk characteristic, <b>delinquency</b> <b>status,</b> presents particular data issues. There {{is a need to}} collect, organize, warehouse, and analyze large data sets that contain loan-level detail over consecutive evaluation dates in order to measure the probability of claim, conditioned on <b>delinquency</b> <b>status.</b> The generally accepted methodology of reserving for mortgage guaranty insurance claim liabilities requires evaluation of dynamic risk characteristics because mortgage guaranty insurance companies need only reserve for loans currently delinquent, both known and IBNR. Because each loan’s <b>delinquency</b> <b>status</b> is usually revised monthly by the mortgage servicing company, the cohort of insured loans currently delinquent changes each month and therefore is dynamic with respect to time. Coincidentally, <b>delinquency</b> <b>status</b> {{has been found to be}} a strong predictor of future losses, so it is imperative for mortgage guaranty insurance companies to estimate reserves as a function of <b>delinquency</b> <b>status,</b> a dynamic risk characteristic. Maintaining historical economic factors in step with the historical delinquency and claim data can also enhance the reserving approach. ________________________________________________________________________ 1...|$|E

40|$|Girls {{and boys}} in the {{juvenile}} justice system are typically treated quite differently. There are a variety of general gender distinctions both in pathways to lawbreaking and responses to these juvenile lawbreakers. Moreover, these gender differences in pathways and systemic responses are almost exclusively to the disadvantage of girls. Research on juvenile delinquency shows that both historically and currently, girls are overall processed far more seriously than boys for <b>delinquency,</b> particularly <b>status</b> crimes (Chesney-Lind & Shelden, 1992).

40|$|The {{relationship}} of appearance {{to family and}} peer relationships was investigated {{in a sample of}} delinquent adolescent boys and a matched sample of nondelinquents, controlling for age, IQ, socioeconomic status, and family risk factors. As predicted, the effects of appearance on family relationships varied with the boys ’ <b>delinquency</b> <b>status,</b> with more baby faced or more attractive delinquents experiencing more adverse effects and more baby faced or more attractive nondelinquents experiencing more favorable effects. These results were attributed in part to a con-trast effect whereby delinquents ’ violation of the benign expecta-tions held for baby faced or attractive individuals results in more negative outcomes for those individuals than for their more mature faced or unattractive peers. Consistent with previous research, peer relationships were better for attractive boys, albeit only when they were delinquent. Peer relationships tended to be poorer for baby faced boys regardless of their <b>delinquency</b> <b>status.</b> Considerable research has shown that people’s facial appearance influences the way they are perceived and treated by others. Baby faced people are perceived to have more childlike traits, such as weakness, submissive-ness, warmth, and naïveté (Berry & McArthur, 1985...|$|E

40|$|Although {{several studies}} have been {{conducted}} on the longitudinal course of childhood disruptive behaviours in community samples and in general psychiatric samples, little is known about adolescent adjustment in psychiatrically treated disruptive behaviour disorder (DBD) children. We examined a sample of adolescents (n = 47) who had been treated as children in an in–patient and/or day–treatment setting because of their severely disruptive behaviour. At follow–up, we found that half of the adolescents had a DBD diagnosis, and on average higher numbers of participants ever used soft drugs, had ever been in court, were not attending school when this was mandatory, and were smoking on a daily basis, as compared to comparison groups. There was, however, a large variance among the adolescents of our sample. When outcome was defined in terms of DBD diagnosis, living <b>status,</b> <b>delinquency,</b> school attendance, and smoking behaviour, 38 % had a positive outcome and 34 % had a poor outcome.

40|$|This thesis {{examines}} the possible outcomes (expired with no loss, settled for loss, still performing) of loans {{and the time}} to hazard events of over 19, 000 guaranteed operating and farm ownership loans which were provided by the Farm Service Agency (FSA). Loans guaranteed by FSA are made by commercial banks, Farm Credit System (FCS), or other lenders to farmers who have limited ability to obtain loans from normal sources without the Federal guarantee. The guarantee allows for payment up to 95 percent when borrowers default. Cox proportional hazards models for operating loans and farm ownership loans are estimated to identify borrower characteristics, loan characteristics, lender types, and farm and macro-economic environment factors that influence loan outcomes. The estimation results indicate that beginning farmer loans {{are more likely to}} expire and more likely to have loss claims and loans with interest assistance are less likely to expire and less likely to have loss claims than are regular loans. Loan outcomes also differ by loan amount, loan term, lender type, and region. In addition, preferred or certified lenders are less likely to have operating loan loss claims.

40|$|Violence is a {{major social}} and health {{problems}} that affects large numbers {{of children and families}} (Fraser, 1996). Youths have become markedly more involved in violent acts over the past decade (Fraser, 1996). Childhood maltreatment has been empirically implicated in a variety of youth problem behaviors (Braaten-Antrim, 1998). Research has linked childhood maltreatment to <b>delinquency,</b> <b>status</b> offenses, teenage pregnancy, substance abuse, and suicide (Braaten-Antrim, 1998). This paper will focus attention on the family dynamics of which child maltreatment and domestic violence is the norm and how this environment may breed aggression in children. Thus, the hypothesis is that children who receive heavy degrees of physical punishment learn aggressive behaviors and are more aggressive than peers who did not. Child maltreatment is an umbrella term that encompasses physical abuse, inadequate care and nourishment, deprivation of medical care, sexual abuse, emotional abuse and neglect (Hull &Kirst-Ashman, 1994). Definitions used by legal and social agencies vary from locality to locality and state to state. For the purpose of this paper, child abuse is defined by Farmer (1989) as any unwanted contact, whether physical or sexual, that causes harm to the child. This paper seeks to review various studies about child victimization to determine if any trends, issues, or conclusions can be discovered. By examining the research of others, it is expected that a direct connection will be found between child maltreatment and later aggressive behavior...|$|E
40|$|We {{develop an}} {{empirical}} {{framework for the}} credit risk analysis of a generic portfolio of revolving credit accounts {{and apply it to}} analyze a representative panel data set of credit card accounts from a credit bureau. These data cover the period of the most recent deep recession and provide the opportunity to analyze the performance of such a portfolio under significant economic stress conditions. We consider a traditional framework for the analysis of credit risk where the probability of default (PD), loss given default (LGD), and exposure at default (EAD) are explicitly considered. The unsecure and revolving nature of credit card lending is naturally modeled in this framework. Our results indicate that unemployment, and in particular the level and change in unemployment, plays {{a significant role in the}} probability of transition across delinquency states in general and the probability of default in particular. The effect is heterogeneous and proportionally has a more significant impact for high credit score and for high-utilization accounts. Our results also indicate that unemployment and a downturn in economic conditions play a quantitatively small, or even irrelevant, role in the changes in account balance associated with changes in an account’s <b>delinquency</b> <b>status,</b> and in the exposure at default specifically. The impact of a downturn in economic conditions and, in particular, changes in unemployment on the recovery rate and loss given default is found to be large. These findings are of particular relevance for the analysis of credit risk regulatory capital under the IRB approach within the Basel II capital accord. ...|$|E
40|$|Probably one of {{the biggest}} {{concerns}} today of most Americans is the problem of crime. Police depend heavily upon citizens to help them fight crime, and so attitudes toward police are important since it is these attitudes which can directly help or hinder police effectiveness. Adolescents are over-represented in committing crimes; therefore, they become a target group in establishing positive community-police relations. Attitudes towards the self are equally important since how we feel about ourselves influences our attitudes towards others. This research investigated the variables of sex, race, age, city size, socioeconomic <b>status,</b> <b>delinquency,</b> police contact, and self-esteem to determine their importance in predicting late adolescents 2 ̆ 7 attitudes toward police. It also studied the relationship between self-esteem and attitudes toward parents, teachers, and police.

In the first, 1328 {{high school students and}} 132 institutionalized youth were classified as either loners or nonloners. Two multivariate analyses of variance revealed no significant main effect of loner <b>status</b> for <b>delinquency,</b> but there were main effects for gender and age. For reputational orientations, there were main effects of loner status, gender, and age. Of the 113 participants identified as loners (75 male and 38 female), 98 were age and gender matched with nonloners for further investigation. Two multivariate analyses of variance with follow-up univariates revealed a main effect of <b>delinquency</b> for loner <b>status,</b> with loners reporting higher levels of involvement in physical aggression, stealing offences, and vehicle-related offences. A significant main effect of loner status was also evident for reputational orientation. Overall, the reputational orientations of loners were suggestive of individuals who wish to be nonconforming but desire this to be of a private nature, which may be why they commit delinquent activities without the presence of an audience.

40|$|This {{research}} is {{an investigation of}} the similarities and differences in the delinquent careers of males and females in a birth cohort.

Results showed patterns of both likeness and difference. Overall, males were found to dominate as offenders and to engage more frequently in illegal acts. When, however, subjects were grouped according to the content of their careers and the frequency of their offending, variations occurred in that overall finding, {{even to the point of}} finding females surpassing males in numbers of offenders and quantity of offensivity. Overall, females dominated 2 ̆ 2 petty 2 ̆ 2 offending [...] primarily status offenses [...] but variations occurred for specific offenses. Males and females who committed only one criminal act had parity ratios for some offenses and male-controlled ratios for others. Two groups of recidivists [...] those who committed criminal offenses only and those who committed both criminal offenses and 2 ̆ 2 petty 2 ̆ 2 offenses [...] were, primarily, dominated by males. Age of onset was tested as a possible explainer of the various patterns and was found not to hold: logical relationships between age of onset and patterns of dominance were not found. There was, however, a strong showing that offending for males and females sometimes followed traditional expectations and sometimes departed from those expectations with females repeatedly engaging in behaviors commonly viewed as the traditional purview of males. This finding, combined with the failure of age of onset to explain the different patterns of male versus female delinquency, led to the suggestion that societal expectations may influence the profile of male and female criminality more than actual differences in male and female inclination or ability. ...|$|R
40|$|The {{effect of}} payment shocks on {{subprime}} hybrid ARM mortgage prepayment and delinquency is examined. Using loan level data from private label securities, we modeled {{the effects of}} payment shocks on mortgage performance. Our study provided interesting empirical results in three main areas: First, we addressed the effect of payment shocks on subsequent mortgage delinquency. Second, we studied how the effect of payment shocks varies and decays over time. Third, we disentangled the impact of payment shocks based on {{the reason for the}} shocks: payment shock due to the expiration of a teaser rate (i. e. "teaser shock") versus the payment shock due to index rate changes at the time of reset (i. e. "market rate shock"). We find that the effect of payment shock on loan performance varies by the <b>delinquency</b> <b>status</b> of the loan {{at the time of the}} shock. That is, the payment shock has the most significant effect on "current" loans rather than loans already in delinquency. Also of note, we find that the effect of a payment shock decays only gradually over time. We find that the impact of "teaser shocks" and "market rate shocks" on mortgage performance do not differ substantially, even though teaser shocks may be somewhat more predictable than market rate shocks. This suggests that either subprime ARM borrowers did not fully understand the product and the extent of the shock at the first reset date or that financially strapped borrowers used the product to speculate and were caught by the teaser shock when they were unable to refinance or sell (i. e. "flip") their properties. The study suggests that any modification plan designed to eliminate potential payment shocks or to otherwise lower payments will be most effective for loans that are currently performing rather than loans that are already in delinquency.

40|$|Abstract. Objective. To {{identify}} the health needs of adolescent males incarcerated in a juvenile justice facil-ity and to compare their health profiles {{with those of}} male adolescents in the community. Methods. Cross-sectional surveys were conducted of incarcerated (N 5 202) and school (N 5 379) samples of male youths. Questionnaires were self-administered and completed before admission health screens (incarcerat-ed youth) or in classrooms (school sample). Health sta-tus was assessed by the Child Health and Illness Profile, Adolescent Edition, using scale and item means and by categorizing each youth’s pattern of health into 1 of 13 mutually exclusive health profile types. Results. Compared with school counterparts, incar-cerated male youths had significantly worse health sta-tus as demonstrated by poorer health and functioning scores in perceived well being, self-esteem, physical dis-comfort, acute, chronic, and psychosocial disorders, family involvement, physical activity, interpersonal problem-solving, risk behaviors, and academic perfor-mance. Three profile types—High Risks, High Risks/ Low Resilience, and Worst Health—accounted for pat-terns of health for 69. 8 % of incarcerated youth versus 37. 3 % of an age-matched school sample. Just 6. 4 % of incarcerated males were in the Excellent/Good Health profile types, which contrasted with 34. 2 % of the age-matched school sample. Conclusions. The health profiles of incarcerated male youths were worse than those of male youths in school. Our results indicate that rehabilitation programs will need to address incarcerated youth’s basic health needs as well as modifying their risk and antisocial behaviors.

40|$|Aggressive {{behavior}} {{has long been}} a major concern in our society. There is a growing consensus that disruptive behavior disorder (DBD) originates from the interaction of biologically based child characteristics with non-optimal characteristics of the child's environment. In this thesis, we investigated neurobiological correlates of aggression and the role they play in the stability of antisocial behavior and/or in changes that occur in that behavior. We did this by focusing on the relationship of aggression to cortisol and testosterone in a low socioeconomic status (SES) population-based sample, and on the relationship of aggression to cortisol and measures of the autonomic nervous system (ANS), i. e. heart rate (HR) and skin conductance level (SCL), in a sample of referred DBD children. In addition, the role of some psychological and family characteristics in stability and change was examined, although these correlates occupy a very modest place in this thesis. Within the low SES male adolescents sample, it appeared that, although we provide some evidence that cortisol and testosterone are correlates of aggressive and antisocial behavior, the relationship was not consistent with and in contrast to what is known from literature. We suggest that {{this may be due to}} the type of participants that were studied. Furthermore, in correspondence with the finding from previous studies, we found that antisocial behavior was relatively stable in a sample of severely disturbed DBD children. There was, however, a large variance among the outcome for adolescents. When outcome was defined in terms of DBD diagnosis, living <b>status,</b> <b>delinquency,</b> school attendance, and smoking behavior, 38...|$|R
40|$|The modern {{juvenile}} justice system is failing our society. A literature review reveals resounding criticism of the system at all points—arrest, court processing, and incarceration. The current system does not effectively reduce recidivism, is wrought with racial disparities, operates with a minimal degree of cultural competence, violates human rights norms, and fails to empower and reform individuals who are directly affected. The current system shatters social bonds and does not hold governmental agencies accountable for wrongdoing or ineffectiveness. Community-based approaches more effectively reduce crime, cost less, are more empowering and culturally competent, help ameliorative civic fragmentation, and are more socially responsible. The definition of community-based approaches to {{juvenile justice}} entails any, and ideally all, of the following: 1) Empowerment of communities and youth who grapple with mass over-incarceration, poverty, violence, under-performing schools, a lack of mental health and health care services, and a dearth of opportunities for growth and development. Such empowerment should honor the expertise and leadership of those directly impacted by the issues; 2) Cultural competence that merges legal service delivery, capacity-building, and advising with the cultural traditions, methodologies, and linguistic elements of the populations receiving services, while acknowledging the concrete causes of racial disparities and injustice; 3) Support {{for the formation of}} social bonds across structural, perceived, and actual adversarial boundaries; 4) Support from the private and public sectors alike; 5) The ability to hold government agencies, especially law enforcement, accountable through legal structures and requirements, community engagement, and varied cultural methodologies; 6) A foundation in human rights laws and norms. The status quo {{juvenile justice system}} is developmentally unsuitable for children. Work in the NJ Family Lawyer highlights brain research and US Dept. of Health data, which reveal that teenagers exhibit distinct behavior regardless of their race or socio-economic <b>status.</b> <b>Delinquency</b> is normative, but is criminalized depending on the social location of the youth and community involved. This evidence provides rationale for treating children in far less punitive ways. Moreover, traditional juvenile justice creates generations of “disconnected youth. ” Additionally, the status quo system lacks cultural competence. Approaches that call for more professional intervention in the lives of disadvantaged communities, more justice system involvement, significant incarceration, and that fail to recognize the assets and self-determination within these communities, will fail to effect lasting change. The current system transplants children out of their home communities, depletes those communities of social assets, isolates the children in prison, offers them scarce and fragmented services, and expects the children to return home and thrive. Research shows that children are returning home in worse shape than when they departed. Extremely medicalized, evidence-based programs like Multi-Systemic Therapy (MST) and Functional Family Therapy (FFT) have proven effective by working with at-risk families and youth in their individual homes, but do not change the disadvantaged surroundings and the dearth of opportunities that the family must grapple with when the program contact ends. Indigenous creation of stronger support systems for those who are tempted to choose crime are the most promising way towards change. Finally, community-based approaches to juvenile justice should be implemented because they cost drastically less than the status quo. There is a host of community-based approaches to juvenile justice that work: Community-based Alternatives To Detention (ATDs) and Alternatives To Incarceration (ATIs); Balanced And Restorative Justice (victim-offender mediation, restitution, peer juries, youth courts, community service) programming; community engagement task forces; other community organizing efforts; Positive Youth Development (PYD); innovative educational programs; and creative ways of addressing police - youth conflict. Further, “Justice reinvestment” is a key to positive outcomes. Overwhelming evidence shows that the current juvenile justice system will not lead to safety, justice, cost-effectiveness, or positive life outcomes for anyone except possibly those corporations and officials who directly profit from it. Community-based approaches need support from all sectors, but especially from the legal community and the private sector. We cannot continue to put stock in the current juvenile justice system without being disappointed at the results...|$|R
