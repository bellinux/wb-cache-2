5|$|Infants and {{patients}} fed via a <b>gastrostomy</b> tube {{can also be}} given a ketogenic diet. Parents make up a prescribed powdered formula, such as KetoCal, into a liquid feed. <b>Gastrostomy</b> feeding avoids any issues with palatability, and bottle-fed infants readily accept the ketogenic formula. Some studies have found this liquid feed to be more efficacious and associated with lower total cholesterol than a solid ketogenic diet. KetoCal is a nutritionally complete food containing milk protein and is supplemented with amino acids, fat, carbohydrate, vitamins, minerals and trace elements. It is used to administer the 4:1 ratio classic ketogenic diet in children over one year. The formula is available in both 3:1 and 4:1 ratios, either unflavoured or in an artificially sweetened vanilla flavour and is suitable for tube or oral feeding. Other formula products include KetoVolve and Ketonia. Alternatively, a liquid ketogenic diet may be produced by combining Ross Carbohydrate Free soy formula with Microlipid and Polycose.|$|E
5|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, resulting in constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period}} than normal). A balanced diet, based on periodical nutritional assessments, is recommended and should be designed to avoid weight loss or gain and minimize consequences of gastrointestinal dysfunction. As the disease advances, swallowing difficulties (dysphagia) may appear. In such cases it may be helpful to use thickening agents for liquid intake and an upright posture when eating, both measures reducing the risk of choking. <b>Gastrostomy</b> to deliver food directly into the stomach is possible in severe cases.|$|E
5|$|Weight {{loss and}} eating {{difficulties}} due to dysphagia and other muscle discoordination are common, making nutrition management increasingly {{important as the}} disease advances. Thickening agents {{can be added to}} liquids as thicker fluids are easier and safer to swallow. Reminding the affected person to eat slowly and to take smaller pieces of food into the mouth may also be of use to prevent choking. If eating becomes too hazardous or uncomfortable, the option of using a percutaneous endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> is available. This is a feeding tube, permanently attached through the abdomen into the stomach, which reduces the risk of aspirating food and provides better nutritional management.

5|$|Dysphagia and dysarthria: {{dysphagia}} is {{a difficulty}} with eating and swallowing which may cause choking and aspiration of food or liquid into the lungs, while dysarthria is a neurological motor speech disorder characterized by poor {{control over the}} subsystems and muscles responsible for speech ("articulation"). A {{speech and language therapist}} may give advice on specific swallowing techniques, on adapting food consistencies and dietary intake, on techniques to improve and maintain speech production and clarity, and on alternative communication approaches. In the case of advanced dysphagia, food can be supplied by a nasogastric tube, which is a tube that goes through the nose directly to the stomach; or a percutaneous endoscopic <b>gastrostomy</b> (PEG), which is a procedure for placing a tube into the stomach and therefore administering food directly to it. This second system, although more invasive, has better results in the long term than nasogastric intake.|$|E
25|$|Feeding tubes can {{decrease}} {{the risk of}} aspiration by enabling persons to avoid liquids or foods {{that are difficult to}} swallow and provide adequate calories without the stress and time commitment of prolonged meals. <b>Gastrostomy</b> tubes do not prevent people from eating by mouth.

40|$|Background: The optimum {{strategy}} for palliative surgery in gastric cancer patientsremains undetermined. Methods: In total, 525 {{patients who had}} undergone palliative surgery between 1994 and 2000 were evaluated in terms of operative mortality, survival, and palliativeeffect. Patients were grouped according to the UICC's classification ofresidual tumors (R) after the operation: microscopic residual tumor (R 1) (N = 104) and macroscopic residual tumor (R 2) (N = 421). Gastric resectionwas performed in all R 1 patients and in 257 of the R 2 patients. Non-resectionprocedures were performed in 164 of the R 2 patients, including gastrojejunostomiesin 64, <b>gastrostomies</b> in 17, jejunostomies in 60, and laparotomiesonly in 23. Results: The operative mortality did not significantly differ among R 1 distal gastrectomies(4. 5 %), R 2 distal gastrectomies (3. 3 %), and R 1 total gastrectomies(2. 9 %) (p = 0. 919). R 2 total gastrectomies showed a particularly higheroperative mortality (10. 9 %) than did the other resection procedures. Thesurvival time and palliative duration were significantly longer in patientsafter palliative resection than after non-resection operations. Postoperativechemotherapy prolonged the survival time of patients after palliative surgery. Conclusion: R 1 or R 2 distal gastrectomies and R 1 total gastrectomies have benefits ofsurvival prolongation and symptomatic palliation. However, the use of atotal gastrectomy in R 2 patients must be selectively reserved for faradvancedcases, otherwise it should be replaced with less-invasive proceduresto avoid a high operative mortality rate.

25|$|The {{probability}} of xerostomia at one year increases by 5% for every 1Gy increase in dose to the parotid gland. Doses above 25–30Gy {{are associated with}} moderate to severe xerostomia.

The threshold for this toxicity is volume-dependent at 55–60Gy, with moderate to severe impairment of swallowing, including aspiration, stricture and feeding tube dependence above a mean dose of 47Gy, with a recommended dose to the inferior constrictor of less than 41Gy. Dose-toxicity relationships for the superior and middle constrictors are steep, with a 20% increase in the {{probability of}} dysphagia for each 10Gy.

25|$|Muscles and nerves {{that control}} the {{digestive}} process may be affected by PD, so {{it is common to}} experience constipation and gastroparesis (food remaining in the stomach {{for a longer period of}} time than normal). A balanced diet is recommended to help improve digestion. Diet should include high-fiber foods and plenty of water. Levodopa and proteins use the same transportation system in the intestine and the blood–brain barrier, competing between them for access. When taken together, the consequences of such competition is a reduced effectiveness of the drug. Therefore, when levodopa is introduced, excessive proteins are discouraged, while in advanced stages, additional intake of low-protein products such as bread or pasta is recommended for similar reasons. To minimize interaction with proteins, levodopa is recommended to be taken 30 minutes before meals. At the same time, regimens for PD restrict proteins during breakfast and lunch and are usually taken at dinner. As the disease advances, dysphagia may appear. In such cases, specific measures include the use of thickening agents for liquid intake, special postures when eating, and <b>gastrostomy</b> in the worst cases.|$|E

Seven hundred and twenty neonates were admitted for major surgery during a 3. 5 -year study period. Hundred and fifty two neonates died pre-operatively, and 568 underwent major neonatal surgery. 352 (62. 0 %) neonates were operated under general anesthesia, while the 216 most fragile neonates (38. 0 %) were operated with local infiltrative anesthesia alone. Medical files were reviewed; data were collected prospectively; mortality risk factors were assessed by univariate and multivariate analysis. Two hundred and sixteen procedures were performed under local anesthesia: sigmoid colostomies (37. 5 %), laparotomies with anastomosis (21. 3 %), anoplasties (18. 1 %), laparotomies with enterostomy (8. 3 %), closures of abdominal wall defects (6. 9 %), fixations of silastic bags (3. 7 %), peritoneal tube drainage (2. 3 %), and <b>gastrostomies</b> (1. 9 %).

Three days after pump implantation, the animals were randomized to receive one of nine diets, differing only in fat content (3. 5 %, 14 %, or 56 % of total calories) and fat composition (100 % Microlipid [primarily safflower oil, rich in linoleic acid], 100 % MaxEPA [fish oil containing 35 % omega-three fatty acids], or a 50 : 50 mixture of both oils). At the end of 2 weeks, survival rates were compared.

Generally it is used where the pathology of the resected specimen indicates features associated with high risk of locoregional recurrence (e.g. extracapsular extension through involved lymph nodes or very close margins). It has shown improved disease-free survival and locoregional control in two very similar clinical trials in such high risk patients, EORTC 22931 (1994–2000) and RTOG 9501 (1995–2000). However, for HPV+OPC patients, such extracapsular spread {{does not appear to}} be an adverse factor and the addition of chemotherapy to radiation in this group provided no further advantage. Since the sample size to detect a survival advantage is large, given the small number of events in this group, these studies may have been underpowered and the question of the utility of adding chemotherapy is being addressed in a randomized clinical trial (ADEPT) with two year locoregional control and disease free survival as the endpoint. The addition of chemotherapy to radiation increases acute and late toxicity. In the GORTEC trial, chemotherapy with docetaxel provided improved survival and locoregional control in locally advanced OPC, but was associated with increased mucositis and need for feeding by <b>gastrostomy.</b> Chemotherapy and radiation are associated with a risk of death of 3–4% in this context.

Dysphagia is a common sequela of TBI, which may result in malnutrition or aspiration pneumonia. There is limited epidemiological data available for TBI and dysphagia in South Africa which is important for health care planning. There is also inadequate literature reporting predictive factors for dysphagia and health outcomes of patients with TBI and swallowing disorders for the South African context, which would provide management guidelines for Speech-Language Pathologists (SLPs) for patients with TBI and dysphagia. This study aims to begin to provide up-to-date information regarding the incidence of TBI and the prevalence of dysphagia in the population with TBI in Bloemfontein, South Africa. Predictive factors for dysphagia and health outcomes were also investigated in order to provide management guidelines for TBI-related dysphagia for SLPs. A prospective cohort study followed 77 participants aged 18 to 68 years (M = 33. 1) with mild to severe traumatic brain injury, admitted to 2 state and 2 private hospitals in the Bloemfontein metropole, South Africa, to investigate the incidence of TBI and the prevalence of TBI-related dysphagia in the adult population in 2013. Participants were tracked from admission to hospital to discharge. Demographic and medical data was collected for each participant, including: gender, age, TBI aetiology, means of nutritional intake, respiratory status, length of hospital stay, and number of speech therapy sessions. Glasgow Coma Scale (GCS) scores at time of admission, swallowing evaluation, and discharge were noted as an indicator of TBI severity and each participant was assessed with the Mann Assessment of Swallowing Ability on admission and prior to discharge to assess the presence of dysphagia. The incidence of TBI for the Bloemfontein metropole was 353 per 100, 000 people and was greater in the male than in the female population (11. 83 : 1). The main mechanism for TBI in Bloemfontein was interpersonal violence (67. 53 %), followed by road traffic accidents (motor and pedestrian vehicle accidents; 23. 38 %). The prevalence rate for dysphagia was 32 %. Twenty-eight percent of those who presented with dysphagia also aspirated. Severe TBI (GCS ≤ 8) was identified as a predictive factor for dysphagia. Participants with dysphagia had longer hospital stays (days; M = 22. 04, SD = 17. 67) than those with normal swallowing (M = 6. 23, SD = 4. 28), t(75) = 6. 13, p <. 001, and took significantly more days to achieve oral intake (M = 6. 23, SD = 10. 32) than those without dysphagia (M =. 31, SD = 1. 41), t(75) = 4. 08, p <. 001. Ventilation was associated with longer hospital stays, rs(25) = -. 47, p =. 02 and longer duration until achievement of oral intake, rs(22) = -. 80, p <. 001. Tracheotomised participants also had significantly longer hospital stays, rs(25) = -. 67, p <. 001, and took longer to achieve oral intake, rs(22) = -. 52, p =. 01. An increased period of time with a tracheostomy was also significantly associated with mortality, χ 2 (2, n = 11) = 6. 52, p =. 04. Participants with dysphagia (M = 3. 84, SD = 5. 44) required significantly more therapy sessions with an SLP than those without dysphagia (M =. 15, SD =. 64), t(75) = 4. 85, p <. 001, and those with low GCS scores were significantly less likely to achieve oral intake prior to discharge, rs(25) = -. 45, p =. 02, and had longer hospital stays than participants with mild head injuries, rs(25) = -. 49, p =. 01. All participants who received nutrition via nasogastric tubes returned to oral intake; however, individuals who had percutaneous endoscopic <b>gastrostomies</b> did not achieve oral intake prior to discharge. It is recommended that objective swallowing evaluations be conducted for patients admitted with severe TBIs, and patients with mild and moderate TBIs be screened to determine the presence of dysphagia. TBI prevention initiatives should be developed to reduce the incidence of TBI, specifically in the young adult male population...|$|R
