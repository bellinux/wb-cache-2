5|$|A {{number of}} {{questions}} are raised within the philosophy of suicide, included what constitutes suicide, whether or not suicide can be a rational choice, and the moral permissibility of suicide. Arguments as to acceptability of suicide in moral or social terms range from {{the position that the}} act is inherently immoral and unacceptable under any circumstances to a regard for suicide as a sacrosanct right of anyone who believes they have rationally and conscientiously come to the decision to end their own lives, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> young and healthy.|$|E
5|$|In 1989, the Internal Revenue Service began {{investigating}} the Reagans over allegations they owed additional {{tax on the}} gifts and loans of high-fashion clothes and jewelry to the First Lady during {{their time in the}} White House (recipients benefiting from the display of such items recognize taxable income <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> returned). In 1992, the IRS determined the Reagans had failed to include some $3 million worth of fashion items between 1983 and 1988 on their tax returns; they were billed for a large amount of back taxes and interest, which was subsequently paid.|$|E

5|$|Ants {{identify}} kin and nestmates {{through their}} scent, {{which comes from}} hydrocarbon-laced secretions that coat their exoskeletons. If an ant is separated from its original colony, it will eventually lose the colony scent. Any ant that enters a colony without a matching scent will be attacked. Also, the reason why two separate colonies of ants will attack each other <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> {{of the same species}} is because the genes responsible for pheromone production are different between them. The Argentine ant, however, does not have this characteristic, due to lack of genetic diversity, and has become a global pest because of it.|$|E
5|$|Reviewer Jennifer Malkowski {{feels that}} Lana {{is one of}} the most gullible {{characters}} on television. According to Malkowski, Lana's strong feminist stance, and her request that people should stop protecting her and start telling her the truth, are diluted by her willingness to believe whatever pieces of information she gets, <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> lies. After the series ended, Gough and Millar expressed regret with Lana's characterization throughout the course of the show, which they felt damaged Lana in the audiences' mind. Gough and Millar believed that Lana's behavior toward Clark (for refusing to reveal his secret) made her come across as cold and unsympathetic.|$|E
5|$|The {{hippocampus}} contains {{high levels}} of glucocorticoid receptors, which make it more vulnerable to long-term stress than most other brain areas. There is evidence that humans having experienced severe, long-lasting traumatic stress show atrophy of the hippocampus more than of {{other parts of the}} brain. These effects show up in post-traumatic stress disorder, and they may contribute to the hippocampal atrophy reported in schizophrenia and severe depression. A recent study has also revealed atrophy as a result of depression, but this can be stopped with anti-depressants <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not effective in relieving other symptoms.|$|E

This is fully in line with Adventist teaching, which promotes annihilationism.|$|R

5|$|The game {{featured}} advanced {{artificial intelligence}} {{due to the}} inclusion of the game's squad command system. Adams and Lugo will assist Walker in battles and react to the battle situation accordingly <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> not given any orders. They will also analyse the situation when instructed and decide the best approach to defeat enemies. The battle command system was designed to be accessible and easy to use, so that players would not have {{to spend a lot of}} time managing the squad. Lugo and Adams may get severely injured and if both of them die, the game ends. This mechanic prompts the player to rescue them as quickly as possible, and the system is designed to create tense situations. The AI for enemies is affected by various factors, including visibility and hearing.|$|E
5|$|The ears {{of river}} {{dolphins}} have specific adaptations to their aquatic environment. In humans, {{the middle ear}} works as an impedance equalizer between the outside air's low impedance and the cochlear fluid's high impedance. In river dolphins, and other cetaceans, there is no great difference between the outer and inner environments. Instead of sound passing through the outer ear to the middle ear, river dolphins receive sound through the throat, from which it passes through a low-impedance fat-filled cavity to the inner ear. The ear is acoustically isolated from the skull by air-filled sinus pockets, which allows for greater directional hearing underwater. Dolphins send out high frequency clicks from an organ known as a melon. This melon consists of fat, and the skull of any such creature containing a melon will have a large depression. This allows river dolphins to produce biosonar for orientation. They are so dependent on echolocation that they can survive <b>even</b> <b>if</b> <b>they</b> <b>are</b> blind. Beyond locating an object, echolocation also provides the animal with an idea on the object's shape and size, though how exactly this works is not yet understood. The small hairs on the rostrum of the Amazon river dolphin are believed {{to function as a}} tactile sense, possibly to compensate for their poor eyesight.|$|E
