40|$|Abstract: A {{rotor system}} {{supported}} by an angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> displays very complicated non-linear behaviour due to non-linear Hertzian contact force. The non-linear force and moment {{caused by the}} <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> are calculated {{on the basis of}} the relationship between deflection, and five-degree-of-freedom dynamic equations of the rotor <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system are established. The Newmark-β method and the Newton–Raphson method are used to solve the non-linear equations. The dynamic characteristics of angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> are computed, considering the non-linear vibration of the rotor system. Taking angular <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> QJS 208 ACQ 4 C 1 /HNP 4 as an example, the effects of the vibration of the rotor system on bearing dynamic characteristics are analysed. The results show that the spin-to-roll ratio of balls, the slide ratio of the cage, and stiffness of the bearing all vary obviously with the non-periodic vibration range of the rotor; initial contact angle and axial load of the <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> change the non-linear dynamic nature of the rotor system and dynamic characteristics of the <b>bearing.</b> The rotor <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> system can work stably by choosing the structural and operation parameters reasonably...|$|R

There has been extensive research in the areas of condition monitoring, diagnostics, and prognostics of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings.</b> As the identification of <b>ball</b> <b>bearing</b> defects by inspection interrupts the operation of rotating machines and can be costly, the assessment of the health of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> relies on the use of condition monitoring techniques. Fault detection and life prediction methods have been developed to improve condition-based maintenance and product qualification. However, intermittent and catastrophic system failures due to bearing problems still occur resulting in loss of life and increase of maintenance and warranty costs. Inaccurate life prediction of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> is of concern to industry.

40|$|One of {{the most}} {{important}} factors influencing <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> service life is its internal radial clearance. However, this parameter is also very complex because it depends on applied radial load and <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> dimensions, surface finish and manufacturing materials. Thermal condition of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> also significantly affects internal radial clearance. Despite many researches performed in order to find out relevant facts about different aspects of <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> thermal behaviour, only few of them are dealing with the real working conditions, where high concentration of solid contaminant particles is present. That’s why the main goal of research presented in this paper was to establish statistically significant correlation between <b>ball</b> <b>bearings</b> temperatures, their working time and concentration of contaminant particles in their grease. Because of especially difficult working conditions, the typical conveyor idlers bearings were selected as representative test samples and appropriate solid particles from open pit coal mines were used as artificial contaminants.
