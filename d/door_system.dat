Aside from the boxier look and smaller side windows, the main changes {{between the new}} IVs and earlier Silverliners {{included}} a dynamic brake system, for which the resistance grids were fitted in the car's signature roof hump, and, for the Penn Central cars, a trainline automatic <b>door</b> <b>system</b> which removed the need for train crew to manually open doors at high level platforms. [...] The Silverliner IVs were also {{the first to be}} delivered in a married pair configuration, although a minority of cars were outfitted as single units. The delivery of the Silverliner IVs allowed SEPTA to replace most of its remaining PRR MP54s and Reading's pre-war MU fleet save for the 38 rebuilt [...] "Blueliner" [...] cars. [...] While being fitted with an updated propulsion system from General Electric, the Silverliner IVs were nevertheless still delivered with Ignitron tube rectifiers, which were later replaced with silicon controlled rectifiers.|$|E
