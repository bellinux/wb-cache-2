40|$|OBJECTIVE [...] To {{describe}} {{the views of}} general practitioners, <b>health</b> <b>visitors,</b> and clinical medical officers on child health surveillance, recent changes, perceptions of each other's roles, and attitudes to audit. DESIGN [...] Postal questionnaire survey. SETTING [...] Three health districts in North West Thames health region. SUBJECTS [...] All 602 general practitioners, 272 <b>health</b> <b>visitors,</b> and 42 clinical medical officers in these districts. MAIN MEASURES [...] Attitudes to and perceptions of child health surveillance and audit. Questionnaires were completed by 440 general practitioners (response rate 73 %), 164 <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> (60 %), and 39 clinical medical officers (93 %). RESULTS [...] Attitudes to child health surveillance were less positive among general practitioners than <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> or clinical medical officers. Few respondents agreed that child health surveillance was a cost effective use of general practitioners' time (general practitioners 28 %, 113 / 407; <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> 28 %, 40 / 145; clinical medical officers 39 %, 15 / 39) and most thought that <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> should carry out more of the doctors' examinations (68 %, 262 / 387; 65 %, 89 / 136; 66 %, 25 / 38). General practitioners thought that clinical medical officers were less supportive than other relevant groups of their doing more child health surveillance. Most (72 %, 105 / 146) <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> thought that the 1990 contract had reduced parental choice of where to attend for child health surveillance. General practitioners were less enthusiastic than <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> about most forms of clinical audit.

40|$|AIM: This paper {{reports on}} the {{perceptions}} of experienced <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> working with refugee families in Inner London. BACKGROUND: Women who are refugees and asylum seekers in the United Kingdom {{are more likely to}} experience depression than either non-refugee women or male asylum seekers. <b>Health</b> <b>visitors</b> provide a universal public health service to all women on the birth of a child, or with children aged under five, and as such are well placed to identify emotional and mental health problems of women who are refugees. Despite successive waves of refugees to the United Kingdom in the 20 th century, there are no empirical studies of health visiting practice with this vulnerable group. There is also no body of evidence to inform the practice of <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> new to working with asylum seekers and refugees. METHODS: An exploratory study was undertaken in Inner London in 2001. Semi-structured interviews were conducted with a purposive sample of 13 <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> experienced in working with women and families who are refugees. FINDINGS: A range of structural challenges was identified that mediated against the development of a health-promoting relationship between <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> and refugee women. With refugee families, who were living in temporary accommodation, <b>health</b> <b>visitors</b> were prioritizing basic needs that had to be addressed: in addition, they prioritized the needs of children before those of women. <b>Health</b> <b>visitors</b> were aware of the emotional needs of women and had strategies for addressing these with women in more settled circumstances. <b>Health</b> <b>visitors</b> considered themselves ill-prepared to deal with the complexities of working with women in these situations. CONCLUSIONS: This study identifies issues for further exploration, not least from the perspective of refugee women receiving health visiting services. <b>Health</b> <b>visitors</b> in countries receiving refugee women are framing their work with these women in ways that reflect Maslow's theory of a hierarchy of needs. This study suggests ways that public health nursing practice could be improved, and identifies issues for further study...|$|R

2500|$|Further {{criticism}} has been aimed at Carmel's portrayal as a <b>health</b> <b>visitor.</b> In the late 1980s, a specialist nursing magazine called Nursing Times [...] had a feature on the character, remarking that she [...] "has {{come in for}} {{quite a bit of}} stick from HVA [...] members who haven't felt that the character gives a good impression of their role". HVA members expressed disappointment that the character [...] "has not developed in a way which promotes the role of health visitors more positively." [...] Roma Iskander, who had discussed the role with EastEnders scriptwriters on behalf of the HVA, said that [...] "Carmel isn't a positive image of a black woman or a health visitor." [...] The magazine article suggested that Carmel's personal problems with family and clients served her right [...] "for moving to Albert Square in the first place. Health visitors be warned — don't live on your work patch". However, in Dominic Strinati's book, Come on Down?: Popular Media Culture in Post-War Britain, Christine Geraghty has argued that [...] "the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depended on her being part {{of the life of the}} Square, regularly and unproblematically available as a source of advice and support in her professional capacity as well as the focus of interest in terms of her personal life." [...] Geraghty has said that tension arose from conflict in the 1980s soaps [...] "between a desire to be positive about a particular issue and a commitment to credibility in terms of character and setting. The HVA, it would appear, want Carmel to be a model <b>health</b> <b>visitor,</b> demonstrating a wide range of skills in a professional manner. But the credibility of Carmel's character in the soap depends on her being a character who is part of the life of the Square, a professional who makes mistakes and whose personal life is almost a source of interest. Quite clearly, the demands for a positive image for health visitors as a profession are less pressing than the necessity to be able to deploy Carmel as a soap opera character. Those making the programme are quite certain that this is the way it must be." ...|$|E
