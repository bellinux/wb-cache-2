40|$|Paper {{concerns}} innovation {{of production}} of rotor and stator plates of inductive position sensors {{which are used}} at automatization of production processes. Authors analyse possibility of efficiency improvement of production of these devices in joint-stock company TES VSET√çN and suggest concrete solving of new production technology. Composition of production line for blanking and roll bending of rotor and stator plates of inductive position sensor from individual technological devices was suggested: <b>decoiler,</b> straightening device, actuating belt feeder, pneumatic shears with inclined tools, belt conveyer and four cylinders bending rolls. Construction of production line was projected in order to its operation can be secured by one production workman, which controls and chooses operation of CNC programme, takes separate roll bended rotor and stator plates of inductive position sensor from bending rolls and according to required technological procedure he composes them to rotor and stator complexes. Construction of production line was projected {{so that it is}} possible to move it by crane without necessity to dismantle and subsequently to put together and adjust the line. ...|$|E
