5|$|In 1918, Espanyol {{started a}} counter-petition against autonomy, which {{at that time}} had become a {{pertinent}} issue. Later on, an Espanyol supporter group would join the Falangists in the Spanish Civil War, siding with the fascists. Despite these differences in ideology, the <b>derbi</b> has always been more relevant to Espanyol supporters than Barcelona ones due to the difference in objectives. In recent years the rivalry has become less political, as Espanyol translated its official name and anthem from Spanish to Catalan.|$|E

5|$|Under {{new manager}} and former captain Luis Enrique, Messi {{experienced}} a largely injury-free {{start to the}} 2014–15 season, allowing him to break three more longstanding records {{towards the end of}} the year. A hat-trick scored against Sevilla on 22 November made him the all-time top scorer in La Liga, as he surpassed the 59-year record of 251 league goals held by Telmo Zarra. Three days later, he scored another hat-trick against APOEL, overtaking Raúl's 71 goals to become top scorer in the history of the Champions League. A third hat-trick, scored against city rivals Espanyol on 7 December, allowed him to surpass César Rodríguez as the all-time top scorer in the <b>Derbi</b> barceloní with 12 goals. Messi again placed second in the FIFA Ballon d'Or behind Cristiano Ronaldo, largely owing to his second-place achievement with Argentina at the World Cup.|$|E

5|$|Benzema {{made his}} league debut for Madrid on 29 August 2009 against Deportivo La Coruña. He started the match, but was {{substituted}} {{out in the}} second half as Madrid won 3–2. A month later, he scored his first goal for the club in a 5–0 victory against newly promoted Xerez. After missing the mid-week match against Villarreal, against Tenerife at the weekend, Benzema scored his first double for Madrid in a 3–0 home victory. He made his Champions League debut for the club on 30 September in a group stage tie against Marseille. In the match, Benzema assisted on a Cristiano Ronaldo goal. After failing to score a goal in the month of October, in the team's first match in November against Italian club Milan in the Champions League, Benzema scored the opener to give Madrid a 1–0 lead. His goal was later cancelled out by a Ronaldinho penalty. On 7 November, in the El <b>Derbi</b> madrileño against Atlético Madrid, Benzema assisted on Madrid's second goal, scored by Marcelo. Madrid won the match 3–2.|$|E

In between those clashes, on 23 April 2011, Benzema scored a goal and assisted on another in a 6–3 win over Valencia. On 30 April, he scored a goal in the team's 3–2 loss to Real Zaragoza. It was the only match of the campaign that Real Madrid loss, in which Benzema scored. To close out the campaign, Benzema scored another double in an 8–1 win over Almería. He finished the campaign second on the team behind Ronaldo with 26 goals as Real Madrid captured the Copa del Rey giving Benzema his first honour with the club. For his performances during the campaign, particularly during the second half, Benzema was praised by Mourinho, club officials Florentino Pérez and Emilio Butragueño, as well as national team manager Laurent Blanc.|$|E

Messi's first goal marked his 350th in the fixture, {{becoming}} the first player ever to achieve this milestone. On 9 September, Messi scored his first hat-trick of the 2017–18 league campaign, against Espanyol in <b>derbi</b> barceloní, thus helping to secure a 5–0 home victory for Blaugrana over local rivals. Messi netted twice against Gianluigi Buffon, on 12 September, as Barça defeated the last season's Italian champions Juventus 3–0 {{at home in the}} UEFA Champions League. On 19 September, Messi found the net four times in a 6–1 trashing of Eibar at the Camp Nou in La Liga. Three weeks later, on 1 October, Messi surpassed his former teammate Carles Puyol to become the third highest appearance maker in the club's history, as he helped Barça defeat Las Palmas 3–0 by assisting Sergio Busquets' opener and later adding two himself in his 594th official game for the club; the league game was played behind closed doors at the Camp Nou due to violence in Catalonia relating to an ongoing independence referendum. On 18 October, in his 122nd European club appearance, Messi scored his 97th UEFA Champions League goal, and his 100th in all UEFA club competitions, in a 3–1 home victory over Olympiakos; he also set up Lucas Digne's goal during the same match. Messi became only the second player after Cristiano Ronaldo to reach this century milestone, but accomplished it in 21 fewer appearances than the Portuguese counterpart. On 23 October, Messi finished as the runner-up behind Cristiano Ronaldo in 2017 Best FIFA Men's Player award for the second consecutive year.

40|$|On August 8, 2009 Alishan county {{area was}} devastated by Typhoon Morakot. The typhoon caused massive {{movement}} of the debris in Alishan Stream's upstream catchment area. Great amount of <b>derbis</b> accumulated in the river course. The process of the <b>derbis</b> movement caused serious damage to villages, roads, cultivated lands, and public utility in the catchment area. In order to quantified damage under the <b>derbis</b> movement, this research utilizes aerial images to create digital terrain model. The landform data of 1996, 2005, and 2009 are rebuilt. Plane spatial analysis and longitudinal spatial analysis are both performed to analyze the river system's variation through the river system itself and the river bed appearance; the latter is mainly {{to find out the}} vertical difference regarding the river course, the change in earth and rock's quantity, and also to examine the lengthwise section and the cross profile of the river course. This study mainly focuses on the lengthwise section for longitudinal spatial analysis, and stream length-gradient index (S-L Index) are used as auxiliary tool. According to the result of this study, from 1996 to 2005, the river course stack was approximately 1, 550, 000 cubic meters between She Xing Bridge and 150 meters upstream from the Lai Ji Bridge along Alishan Stream; from 2005 till 2009 after the typhoon hit, the river accumulation jumped to about 11, 360, 000 cubic meters in the same area, which shows Alishan Stream has accumulated <b>derbis</b> in a great amount since Typhoon Morakot hit Taiwan. Through evaluating the river course's present situation, the following-up government plan may be brought into discussion. 西元 2009 年 8 月 8 日莫拉克颱風重創阿里山鄉地區，颱風造成阿里山溪上游集水區大量土石下移，河道內土石嚴重堆積，河床變遷，土石運動過程對集水區內聚落、道路、耕地及公共設施形成嚴重傷害。為瞭解土石變遷造成的危害，運用Leica Geosystems 公司所生產之ERDAS IMAGINE 的Leica Photogrammetry Suites(LPS) 模組，進行正射影像(Orthoimage) 處理與數值地形模型(DTM) 的製作，並對不同年代的正射影像與數值地形模型進行資料的比對，影像來源為農林航空測量所歷年來在阿里山溪地區所拍攝的航空影像。 分別重製民國 85 年、民國 94 年以及民國 98 年之數值地形模型，並以水系空間分析區分為平面空間分析與縱向空間分析，前者是以水系及河床樣貌來分析水系的變異情況；後者主要是以垂直方向來探討河道高程的變化、土石的變異量以及河道的縱剖面與橫剖面，並檢討其成因。在本研究中，縱向空間分析主要以河流的縱剖面分析為主，並輔以河流坡降指數（S-L Index），坡降指數利用地形學河流縱剖面的概念，評估原河流縱剖面與理想河流縱剖面間的差異，用河流坡降指標作為評估的依據。 根據分析結果，民國 85 年到 94 年間位於阿里山溪的社興橋至來吉橋上游 150 公尺處，河道堆積約為 155 萬立方公尺， 94 年到 98 年颱風過後社興橋至來吉橋上游 150 公尺處，河道堆積約為 1136 萬立方公尺，顯示莫拉克颱風過後造成阿里山溪嚴重堆積，透過評估河道的現況，可以探討河道淤積後續之治理規劃。摘要	I Abstract	II 總目錄	IV 圖目錄	IX 第一章 緒論	 1 1. 1 研究動機	 1 1. 2 研究目的	 2 1. 3 研究流程	 4 1. 4 研究區域	 5 第二章 文獻回顧	 9 2. 1 河流的型態	 9 2. 1. 1 河床的縱剖面或坡度	 9 2. 1. 2 河流的橫剖面	 10 2. 1. 3 河流的平面形態	 11 2. 2 數值航空攝影測量	 13 2. 2. 1 空中三角測量	 15 2. 2. 2 影像匹配技術	 17 2. 2. 3 影像金字塔	 19 2. 3 數值地形模型	 20 2. 3. 1 數值地形模型之資料特性	 21 2. 4 座標系統	 22 2. 4. 1 像片座標系統	 22 2. 4. 2 TWD 97 	 24 2. 5 Leica Geosystems遙感探測及影像處理系統	 28 2. 6 河流縱剖面曲線擬合函數	 33 2. 7 河流坡降指標（stream length-gradient index, SL index）	 36 第三章 研究方法	 37 3. 1 數值航空攝影測量	 37 3. 2 數位航空攝影測量	 59 3. 3 地形資料變異分析	 64 3. 3. 1 河道剖面製作與計算	 67 3. 3. 2 高程變異分析	 67 第四章 成果分析	 70 4. 1 正射影像分析成果	 70 4. 2 數值地形模型成果	 73 4. 3 運用正射影像判釋研究地區平面型態之變遷	 75 4. 3. 1 崩塌地於不同時期變遷分析	 76 4. 3. 2 研究地區河道橫斷面之分析	 78 4. 4 河道高程變異分析	 81 4. 4. 1 阿里山溪縱剖面高程變異分析	 82 4. 4. 2 支流縱剖面高程變異分析	 84 4. 5 河道橫剖面高程變異分析	 89 4. 5. 1 阿里山溪橫剖面高程變異分析	 89 4. 6 河道堆積變異量分析	 96 第五章 河流坡度異常區域評估	 99 5. 1 河流縱剖面擬合計算	 99 5. 2 河流坡降指標原理	 100 5. 3 河流坡降指標計算(SL index) 	 101 5. 4 河流坡降指標值計算	 101 5. 5 河流縱剖面簡單函數擬合	 103 5. 5. 1 河流縱剖面初步迴歸	 105 5. 6 計算各河流之河流坡降指標值	 107 5. 6. 1 計算區間評定	 107 5. 6. 2 原始以及理想河流縱剖面河流坡降指標值計算	 108 5. 7 製作河流坡度異常區域圖	 110 第六章 綜合討論	 119 6. 1 研究方法的可行性探討	 119 6. 2 航空攝影測量精度之探討	 120 6. 3 分析結果之討論	 121 6. 3. 1 河道變遷情況	 121 6. 3. 2 河道堆積量比較	 123 6. 4 較危險的河流坡度異常區	 124 6. 4. 1 河流異常區域型態討論	 125 第七章 結論與建議	 126 7. 1 結論	 126 7. 2 建議	 127 參考文獻	 129 附錄A 阿里山子集水區數值地形模型精度檢核之成果	 134 附錄B 紀錄檔資料格式說明	 135 附錄C 民國 85 年航帶 1 	 136 附錄D 民國 85 年航帶 2 	 137 附錄E 民國 85 年航帶 3 	 138 附錄F 民國 85 年航帶 4 	 139 附錄G 民國 94 年航帶 1 	 140 附錄H 民國 94 年航帶 2 	 141 附錄I 民國 94 年航帶 3 與航帶 4 	 142 附錄J 民國 98 年航帶 1 	 143 附錄K 民國 98 年航帶 2 	 144 附錄L 航測相機參數	 145 附錄M 相機參數	 146 附錄N 相機參數	 14...|$|R
