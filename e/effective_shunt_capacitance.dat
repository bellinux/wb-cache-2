Fault {{in the present}} context represents a discrete change, e. g. short-circuiting a few turns within a disc (i. e. predominantly an inductive change) and/or addition of some tens of pico-Farad capacitance between a disc and ground (i. e. predominantly a capacitive change).

40|$|Abstract—In this paper, {{equations}} for waveforms {{and design}} re-lationships are derived for class DE amplifiers with nonlinear <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitances.</b> Using the analytical waveform equations, it is {{shown that the}} nonlinearity of the <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitances</b> affects the wave-forms only during the dead-time intervals. Additionally, the wave-forms with nonlinear and linear <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitances</b> are not very different if class E zero-voltage switching/zero-derivative switching conditions are satisfied. The operation of a class DE amplifier has two dead-time intervals in one period. The switch-voltage wave-forms for both dead-time intervals exhibit symmetry. Therefore, the nonlinearity {{does not have any}} effect on the series-resonant-cir-cuit elements. As a result, analytical design equations indicate that the series-resonant-circuit elements are independent of the nonlin-earity of the <b>shunt</b> <b>capacitances</b> when the supply voltage and the output power are given as design specifications, which is an impor-tant result of this paper.
