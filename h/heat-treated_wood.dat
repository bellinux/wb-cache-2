The aim of this study was to impregnate wood with nano-sized boron nitride (NBN) to improve its thermal stability and to investigate the changes in the properties of Scots pine, Ash and Iroco woods after the impregnation. The effects of the impregnation with NBN also were investigated on the <b>heat-treated</b> <b>woods.</b> The impregnation was conducted with using empty-cell method (the Rueping method) in a chamber under a pressure of 6 bars for 1 hr. Densities at 0 % and 12 % moisture content (MC), mechanical properties, color changes, thermal stability, and scanning electron microscopy (SEM/EDX) analysis were determined. The test results showed that the impregnation of wood with NBN increased generally the flexural strength and elasticity of modulus at bending, but the NBN impregnation decreased generally the compression strength except for ACI, ATWI, IC, and ICI. It was also determined that the changes in density and color were statistically different after the impregnation. According to the SEM/EDX results, deposits of nano-sized boron nitride were found inside the cell wall and on the pits. But the deposits were also determined in inside structure of the wood with EDX analysis. Thermal stability in T 10 % and T 50 % of wood was found to improve after the impregnation with NBN.

High temperature heat-treatment of wood for wood preservation is more beneficial compared to chemical treatment. There are several advantages of <b>heat-treated</b> <b>wood</b> compared to kiln dried wood due to the chemical modifications during high temperature heat-treatment. Heat-treated woods have improved dimensional stability, improved thermal insulating properties, and improved biological resistance. Also high temperature heat-treatment changes wood color to a dark brown color which {{is very important for}} decorative purposes. But unfortunately this color is not stable and it changes to grey or white depending on the wood species during weathering. Protection of <b>heat-treated</b> <b>wood</b> against discoloration due to weathering is the main objective of this study without changing its natural appearance. For this purpose waterborne acrylic polyurethane base was chosen for their high durability against weathering and non toxic nature. Since <b>heat-treated</b> <b>wood</b> is green product minimal use of chemicals during coating formulation was another very important factor. For this reason natural antioxidants were extracted from barks which are easily biodegradable and the source is renewable in nature. Also CeO 2 nano particles were also used alone or together with lignin stabilizer to achieve a better protection against weathering on heat-treated jack pine.
