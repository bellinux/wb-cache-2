30|$|Under static {{conditions}} (before any production/injection or circulation), the reservoir temperature is stabilized at constant temperature which follows the geothermal gradient. In a dynamic process such as production, injection or during drilling mud circulation, the <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperature</b> changes. These changes take place under two processes: convection and conduction. After a stop of production/injection operation, down-hole well temperature is readjusted to stabilize reservoir temperature. This readjustment also happens under the convection/conduction heat transfer processes. Considering both conduction and convection processes simultaneously in calculations would just complicate the computations. After start of shutting in the well, especially {{when using the}} down-hole valve, the flow of fluid sharply diminishes; so, we can ignore the effect of convection process on the temperature re-adjustment. Therefore, {{it is assumed that}} the process of returning the <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperature</b> to its static condition follows an unsteady-state heat conduction process.|$|E

40|$|Geothermal {{exploration}} programs require accurate subsurface temperature {{information and}} currently this information primarily comes from temperature maps created from shallow extrapolated <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements. These extrapolations, often taken from measurements made in non-equilibrated boreholes, do {{not account for}} variations in geological structure or thermal conductivity. Here we explore temperature maps at 5 km for extrapolated equilibrated and non-equilibrated bores and for modelled basin temperatures. Modelled temperatures are derived from finite element models using 3 D basin geology and defined thermal properties. When 3 D thermal modelling is compared to extrapolated temperatures at both shallow (500 m) and deep (5 km) intervals it can be shown that shallow surface temperature variations (from extrapolated measurements) are often not seen at depth. Depending on whether equilibrated or non-equilibrated temperature measurements are extrapolated, {{the positions of the}} potential target anomalies shift. In general both equilibrated and nonequilibrated extrapolated measurements either overestimate or underestimate temperatures at 5 km.

Detailed comparison of the calc–silicate (zeolites and prehnite) mineral distributions of the Lopra- 1 / 1 A sequence with those from other regions indicates that this sequence exhibits consistently longer down-hole intervals for secondary mineral species than reported elsewhere. When compared to measured <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperatures</b> reported in other hydrothermally altered regions, the results suggest that the Lopra- 1 / 1 A mineral progression formed under conditions typical of low temperature hydrothermal systems that form shortly after eruption of thick basaltic piles. Maximum temperatures achieved at the 3500 m level of the well were at or below 200 °C. The implied geothermal gradient was less than 50 °C/km. An analysis of prehnite – fluid composition relationships was also conducted in order to determine if results compatible with the paragenetic sequence study could be obtained from thermodynamic constraints. In this case, thelimiting temperature for prehnite formation in equilibrium with albite–quartz–calcite–laumontite (the mineral assemblage {{at the bottom of the}} hole) was determined for a range of fluid compositions. The resulting calculations suggest temperatures of formation of prehnite in the range of 140 °C to 205 °C, a conclusion which is broadly consistent with those reached from study of the parageneticrelationships. Comparison of these results with other studies of palaeogeothermal gradients of the North Atlantic margins suggests a consistent pattern in which relatively low geothermal gradientspersisted in the Palaeogene rift basin...|$|R
40|$|A shallow (∼ 2 km) granite {{body has}} been intersected by the MONT- 4 well in new {{producing}} areas of the Larderello geothermal field. The granite at 2. 2 – 2. 5 km and below 3 km underwent pervasive propylitic alteration that {{is dominated by the}} assemblage chlorite+adularia+quartz+illite+calcite+albite±epidote±sphene. Fluid inclusion studies indicate two stages of alteration. The first one is characterised by high-temperature fluids that, at 2218 m, were trapped under boiling conditions at about 340 °C and 15 MPa, whereas at 3520 m evidence of boiling is not revealed and the temperature of the fluid was calculated to be about 350 °C. The second alteration stage shows a cooling of the system, particularly evident in the shallower portion of the intrusion (∼ 235 °C at 2218 m and ∼ 315 °C at 3520 m). The temperature of homogenisation for subsequent cooler inclusions approximates present-day <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperatures,</b> and may be considered as representative of the fluid actually circulating in the granite in recent times. Calculated δ 18 O values of 0 ± 1 ‰, for fluids in equilibrium at 340 °C (2218 m) and 350 °C (3520 m) with feldspar, epidote and chlorite, and δD values of − 51 to − 61 ‰, for fluids in equilibrium with chlorite, together with directly measured δD values of − 33 to − 61 ‰ for fluid inclusions in quartz, indicate derivation from meteoric waters. The original meteoric signature of the fluids has been altered through water–rock interaction, but remains clearly distinguished from a primary magmatic signature, for which no isotopic evidence was found. Active fracturing and the high structural relief of granite emplacement promoted hydrothermal circulation in the granitic body drilled by MONT- 4 well, suggesting that such characteristics may be a pre-requisite for such circulation at Larderell...|$|R
40|$|Carbon dioxide (CO 2) {{sequestration}} {{into deep}} underground reservoirs such as saline aquifers, oil reservoirs and coal seams {{have found out}} to be one of the best practical solutions to reduce significant amount of greenhouse gases from the environment. The success of any large scale CO 2 sequestration project depends on many factors, and two of the important factors are (a) the stability of injection well and (b) well cement. To date, OPC based cement has been used as well cement, and it has been found that it is unstable in CO 2 environments as it undergoes degradation, strength reduction, and shrinkage. Therefore, a comprehensive experimental study has been undertaken to investigate the suitability of geopolymer as well cement and the mechanical behavior of geopolymer and class G cement was compared under different <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperatures.</b> When the uniaxial compressive strength (UCS) of geopolymer and G cement was compared, it was found that geopolymer possess higher UCS values at elevated temperatures (above 50 &# 0176;C) and G cement possesses the highest values at ambient conditions. The peak strength of both geopolymer and class G cement was observed at curing temperatures of 50 - 60 &# 0176;C. In addition, acoustic emission (AE) test data revealed that the crack propagation stress thresholds of class G cement are higher at ambient conditions, whereas geopolymer possesses highest values at elevated temperatures. The photogrammetric results of strain measurement show that geopolymer undergoes shear failure at lower curing temperatures, whereas the failure was splitting at elevated temperatures. In addition, the type of failure of class G cement was shear failure for all the curing temperatures and the ultimate failure strain did not vary much with the curing temperature...|$|R

The pressure in the pipe is caused to rise or fall respectively, and pressure waves are generated. The modulated data are then transferred to the surface with drilling mud pulses.|$|E
40|$|This work {{is based}} on a fluid {{inclusion}} investigation on two core samples (sampled at 3017 m and 4150 m of depth) of a granite intrusion drilled by the Travale 1 sud geothermal well, in the eastern sector of Larderello geothermal field. Fluid inclusion data demonstrate that the earliest fluids circulating in the intrusion were high-temperature brines exsolved directly from the crystallizing magma during its ascent in the shallow crust. The progressive release of magmatic fluids from the crystallizing granitic magma probably occurred under confining lithostatic pressure of about 200 MPa. Two phase fluid inclusions represent the hydrothermal meteoric water-dominated fluids that penetrated in the granite after opening of the system, induced by cooling and consequent transition from ductile behaviour to brittle fracturing.

The demand for higher operating temperatures, combined with recent {{declines in the}} high temperature reliability of commercial packages, is forcing the industry to use more ceramic hybrid assemblies. While ceramic hybrid technologies have been developed and proven viable for high temperature use for over 20 years, commercially available processes have been elusive. Most commercial facilities do not take the care required for reliable high temperature operation nor are they scaled for the low volumes typical of the down-hole industry. We present a new hybrid circuit assembly process that has been optimized for high temperature (225 °C) hybrid circuits.

40|$|The thermal {{structure}} of sedimentary basins is largely dependent on complex three-dimensional effects encompassing architecture, geology and groundwater, {{making it difficult}} to describe in a one-dimensional model. New equilibrated <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperature</b> measurements in the Sydney Basin, in conjunction with regional scale thermal modelling using the geodynamics simulation software Underworld, can provide an accurate assessment of the thermal {{structure of}} the basin. When compared with extrapolation maps, these results highlight important limitations of utilising extrapolation maps as an unaccompanied geothermal exploration tool. The extrapolated temperature method creates a 'temperature-at-depth' map, which propagates and exaggerates near surface variations, and is limited by coverage and number of boreholes that have temperature measurements recorded. Numerical simulations of basin heat flow, using basic material properties, combined with a deep three-dimensional geological model and calibrated by measured equilibrated temperature data are not limited by the borehole coverage but rather the chosen resolution of the model.

In Australia, the database of temperature measurements is small, limited by sparse distribution and tainted by nonequilibrium conditions. Groundwater temperature data from the groundwater-monitoring/water-supply bore network provide a creative cost effective way to bridge the information gap. <b>Down-hole</b> <b>temperature</b> profiles are valuable when thermal equilibrium conditions are present. Equilibrium conditions are common in groundwater bores as they are installed to be long term. Effective use of groundwater temperature data for geothermal exploration requires an understanding of (1) the thermal conditions being measured, (2) the factors that affect the measurement, and (3) how the measurements can be used. Highly constrained models, rather than extrapolation maps, are the cost effective, risk-reducing solution for geothermal exploration in Australia. The Sydney Basin provides {{a case study of}} how an undervalued, 'cold' coal-bearing sedimentary basin became 'hot' through high-resolution modelling using groundwater temperature measurements.

40|$|Geomechanical damage, such as {{fracturing}} of wellbore cement, can severely impact well {{integrity in}} CO 2 storage fields. Chemical reactions between the cement and CO 2 -bearing fluids may subsequently alter the cement’s mechanical properties, either enhancing or inhibiting damage accumulation during ongoing changes in wellbore temperature and stress-state. To evaluate {{the potential for}} such effects, we performed triaxial compression tests on Class G Portland cement, conducted at <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperature</b> (80 °C) and effective confining pressures ranging from 1 to 25 MPa. After deformation, samples displaying failure on localised shear fractures were reacted with CO 2 –H 2 O, and then subjected to a second triaxial test to assess changes in mechanical properties.

These delineate stress conditions where unreacted cement is most prone to dilatational (permeability-enhancing) failure. Once shear-fractures formed, later reaction with CO 2 did not produce further geomechanical weakening. Instead, after six weeks of batch reaction, we observed up to 83 % recovery of peak-strength and increased frictional strength (15 %– 40 %) in the post-failure regime, due to carbonate precipitation in the fractures. As such, our results suggest more or less complete mechanical healing on timescales of the order of months...|$|E
40|$|To {{create the}} {{ultimate}} wireless instrumentation unit for <b>down-hole</b> applications high <b>temperature</b> electronics with very high reliability is needed. It {{is possible to}} use ordinary bulk-CMOS devices at temperature up to 175 ⁰C, but the lifetime at these temperatures is to low for a down-hole instrumentation unit. An alternative is to use s Silicon on Insulator process under the fabrication of the semiconductors. The SOI process is a fabrication process where there is buried a oxide layer in the silicon wafer, and thus allowing higher breakdown voltage and/or lower current leakage. The low current leakage allows the semiconductors to be used at higher junction temperature. SOI devices that are commercial available off-the-shelf as a expected lifetime for at least 5 years at 225 ⁰C and thus much lower at junction temperatures below 200 ⁰C. The SOI technology can then be used together with hybrid circuits using ceramic substrate {{as a replacement for}} organic PCB and thick-film technology for the passive devices. A package like this gives a system with high reliability both toward high temperature operation and lifetime. The main limitation in the high temperature design is the availability off the larger capacitors; the limitation for high temperature stacked capacitors is 200 ⁰C. The converters designed are the standard step-up and step-down switch-mode power supplies. The converters are designed with current mode control; current mode control is used because of the advantage that comes with it. One off the advantages is the possibility to limit the inductor current; another advantage is the possibility to use constant current charging for the battery. When designing the SOI devices for high temperature operation it is difficult to achieve high enough breakdown voltage. With this in mind, the high temperature converter is designed with series coupled transistors to achieve high enough breakdown voltage for high voltage operation. The transistors have always some small perturbations in their specifications, this has to be considered when connecting transistors in series. This perturbations in for example turn-off speed makes an uneven voltage sharing; this is solved by connecting suitable capacitors in parallel with the switches to maintain an even voltage sharing. </p...|$|R
40|$|The {{absence of}} {{high-temperature}} electronics is {{an obstacle to}} the development of untapped energy resources (deep oil, gas and geothermal). US natural gas consumption is projected to grow from 22 trillion cubic feet per year (tcf) in 1999 to 34 tcf in 2020. Cumulatively this is 607 tcf of consumption by 2020, while recoverable reserves using current technology are 177 tcf. A significant portion of this shortfall may be met by tapping deep gas reservoirs. Tapping these reservoirs represents a significant technical challenge. At these depths, temperatures and pressures are very high and may require penetrating very hard rock. Logistics of supporting 6. 1 km (20, 000 ft) drill strings and the drilling processes are complex and expensive. At these depths up to 50 % of the total drilling cost may be in the last 10 % of the well depth. Thus, as wells go deeper it is increasingly important that drillers are able to monitor conditions <b>down-hole</b> such as <b>temperature,</b> pressure, heading, etc. Commercial off-the-shelf electronics are not specified to meet these operating conditions. This is due to problems associated with all aspects of the electronics including the resistors and capacitors. With respect to capacitors, increasing temperature often significantly changes capacitance because of the strong temperature dependence of the dielectric constant. Higher temperatures also affect the equivalent series resistance (ESR). High-temperature capacitors usually have low capacitance values because of these dielectric effects and because packages are kept small to prevent mechanical breakage caused by thermal stresses. Electrolytic capacitors do not operate at temperatures above 150 oC due to dielectric breakdown. The development of high-temperature capacitors to be used in a high-pressure high-temperature (HPHT) drilling environment was investigated.

Restart capability at extreme temperatures and the effects of thermal cycling, covering the test temperature range, on its operation and stability were also investigated. Under no load condition, the voltage reference chip exhibited good stability in its output over the temperature range of - 50 C to + 200 C. Outside that temperature range, output voltage did change as temperature was changed. For example, at the extreme temperatures of + 210 C and - 190 C, the output level dropped to 2. 43 V and 2. 32 V, respectively as compared to the nominal value of 2. 5 V. At cryogenic test temperatures of - 100 C and - 150 C the output voltage dropped by about 20 %. The quiescent supply current of the voltage reference varied slightly with temperature but remained close to its specified value. In terms of line regulation, the device exhibited excellent stability between - 50 C and + 150 C over the entire input voltage range and load levels. At the other test temperatures, however, while line regulation became poor at cryogenic temperatures of - 100 C and below, it suffered slight degradation at the extreme high temperature but only at the high load level of 10 mA. The voltage reference also exhibited very good load regulation with temperature down to - 100 C, but its output dropped sharply at + 210 C only at the heavy load of 10 mA. The semiconductor chip was able restart at the extreme temperatures of - 190 C and + 210 C, and the limited thermal cycling did not influence its characteristics and had no impact on its packaging as no structural or physical damage was observed...|$|R

The investigations defined the southward extent of the Wendover graben into and near Focus Area 1, enhanced the understanding of subsurface conditions, and focused further geothermal exploration efforts towards the northwestern-most part of Focus Area 1. Specifically, the detailed gravity survey shows that the Wendover graben, first defined by Cook et al. (1964) for areas north of Interstate Highway 80, extends and deepens southwest-ward to the northwest corner of Focus Area 1. At its deepest point, the intersection with a northwest-trending graben there is favorable for enhanced permeability associated with intersecting faults. Processing and modeling of the gravity data collected during 2011 provide a good understanding of graben depth and distribution of faults bounding the graben and has focused the interest area of the study. <b>Down-hole</b> logging of <b>temperatures</b> in wells made available near the Intrepid, Inc., evaporation ponds, just north of Focus Area 1, provide a good understanding of the variability of thermal gradients in that area and corroborate the more extensive temperature data reported by Turk (1973) for the depth range of 300 - 500 m. Moderate temperature gradients {{in the northern part of}} the Intrepid area increase to much higher gradients and bottom-hole temperatures southeastward, towards graben-bounding faults, suggesting upwelling geothermal waters along those faults. Water sampling, analysis, and temperature measurements of Blue Lakes and Mosquito Willey's springs, on the western boundary of Focus Area 1, also show elevated temperatures along the graben-bounding fault system. In addition, water chemistry suggests origin of those waters in limestone rocks beneath the graben in areas with temperatures as high as 140 C (284 F). In conclusion, all of the field data collected during 2011 and documented in the Appendices of this report indicate that there is reasonable potential for a viable geothermal resource along faults that bound the Wendover graben. Prospects for a system capable of binary electrical generation are especially good, and the possibility of a flash steam system is also within reason. The next steps should focus on securing the necessary funding for detailed geophysical surveys and for drilling a set of temperature gradient wells to further evaluate the resource, and to focus deep exploration efforts in the most promising areas...|$|R

To this end, we first review examples where passive DTS has been used to study hydrogeology via down-hole applications. Secondly, we discuss and categorize current A-DTS borehole methods into three types. These are thermal advection tests, hybrid cable flow logging, and heat pulse tests. We explore the various options with regards to cable installation, heating approach, duration, and spatial extent in order to improve their applicability in a range of settings. These {{determine the extent to which}} each method is sensitive to thermal properties, vertical in well flow, or natural gradient flow. Our review confirms that the application of DTS has significant advantages over discrete point temperature measurements, particularly in deep wells, and highlights the potential for further method developments in conjunction with other emerging fiber optic based sensors such as Distributed Acoustic Sensing.

3000|$|Having a good {{estimation}} of geothermal gradient and the reservoir temperature {{has a great}} impact on the methodological reservoir management in the entire reservoir life, from natural depletion phase up to draining the last portion of hydrocarbon by applying an appropriate EOR method. This issue could become crucial in a gas condensate reservoir management as the reservoir temperature has great influence on the time and amount of precipitated condensate in the reservoir and on the surface. It is usual to consider a constant reservoir temperature throughout the field. Also, encountering a constant geothermal gradient, with a similar fluid in a reservoir, is expected. During drilling campaign of two appraisal wells (one in the crest and other in the flank) of one of Middle East gas reservoir, it is aproximately found one geothermal gas gradient in both well; however, with some displacement in the wells. To find out a scientific justification for this phenomenon, a study was set out and results were presented in this paper. By using the analytical solution to unsteady-state conduction heat transfer for a cylinder with a radius of r [...] m [...] and infinite length and the available temperature data from FBDSTs, the exact reservoir temperature at different depths is calculated. It is also shown that by using the analytical solution ‘affected thermal well bore radius’ can be estimated. The affected thermal well bore radius is defined as the radius that beyond it, formation rock is not affected by any <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperature</b> variation. Based on the elaborated work, in addition to confirmation of having one geothermal gradient in the reservoir, it is found out that the ‘affected thermal well bore radius’ in wells is about 20 – 60  cm. Also by using the basic steady-state conduction heat transfer equation and assuming that the amount of transferred heat via layers of earth is constant, it is qualitatively shown that having different reservoir temperatures at constant depth throughout a giant deep-reservoir is normal and it should be accounted for the reservoir simulation.|$|E
30|$|Numerous {{models for}} {{predicting}} gas condensate dew point pressure have been derived from large databases in the literature. There are essentially {{two types of}} published models for estimating dew point pressure in gas condensate reservoirs. One type of models uses detailed compositional analysis that requires laboratory PVT experiments, while another type uses easily measured parameters from production tests and <b>down-hole</b> <b>temperature</b> as inputs. Marruffo et al. (2002), Nemeth and Kennedy (1966), Elsharkawy (2001, 2011), Shokir (2008), Olds et al. (1944), and Godwin (2012) require detailed compositional analysis. Marruffo et al. (2002) used nonlinear regression to fit appropriate models and build their model, applying statistical tools such as residual analyses and cross-plots. The developed model required information from production tests, but did not require the knowledge of gas condensate composition. The original total PVT data sample size they used was 148. After the process of selection and validation, the database was reduced to 114 data points. Nemeth and Kennedy (1966) used 579 data points from 480 different hydrocarbon systems to develop a model that predicts dew point pressure with an average deviation of 7.4 %. The model input parameters are variables measured in the laboratory with composition in mole fraction for CH 4 through C 7 H 16, N 2, CO 2, H 2 S, and molecular weight and specific gravity of heptane plus fraction. Their work is regularly quoted {{in many of the}} more recent models. Elsharkawy (2001) developed a physically sound empirical method for predicting dew point pressure based on routinely measured gas analysis and reservoir temperature. In total, 340 measurements of dew point pressure were used, resulting in a model with an absolute average of 7.68 %. The model included the effect of all variables such as temperature, gas condensate composition, and properties of the plus fraction on dew point pressure. Elsharkawy (2001, 2011) discussed the two types of dew points applicable to any hydrocarbon mixtures. The first dew point occurs when dry gas is compressed to the point that liquid starts to form. The second called retrograde or condensate dew point and occurs when a gas mixture containing heavy hydrocarbons in its solution is depressurized until liquid forms. He presented models for dew point prediction based on gas composition and reservoir temperature. His database included 340 data points. Shokir (2008) used genetic programming to develop a model for dew point pressure prediction from 245 gas condensate systems. The developed model uses the full composition of the gas (CH 4 through C 7 H 16 +, N 2, CO 2, and H 2 S mole fractions) in addition to the molecular weight of the heptanes plus fraction, and reservoir temperature. He also tested his model against other published models. Olds et al. (1944) studied the behavior of six symmetrically chosen mixtures from Paloma field for a range of parameters (temperatures ranged from 100 to 250  °F and pressures up to 5000 psia). They studied the influence of pressure and temperature on the composition and the retrograde gas dew point, and implemented a graphical examination in order to obtain a chart correlating volumetric and phase behavior with the composition of the system and temperature. Godwin (2012) used data from the literature and developed a dew point estimation model based on gas composition, reservoir temperature, and properties of the heptanes plus fraction. A total of 259 out of 273 data points were selected to build the new model, and 14 data points were used for testing.|$|E
