Higher plants provide an essential part since they supply food and oxygen and recycle carbon dioxide. There are indications that under space conditions plants might be inefficient regarding the uptake, transport and distribution of nutrients, which in turn affects growth and metabolism. Therefore, Arabidopsis thaliana (Col- 0) seeds were germinated and grown for five days under fast clinorotation (2 -D clinostat, 60 rpm) in order to simulate microgravity. Concentrations of ten different nutrients (potassium, sulfur, phosphorus, calcium, sodium, magnesium, manganese, iron, zinc, and boron) in shoots of plants grown under reduced and normal (1 g) gravity conditions were compared. A protocol was developed for the determination of different nutrients by means of inductively coupled plasma optical <b>emission</b> spectrometry (ICPOES), <b>flame</b> <b>emission</b> spectrometry and <b>spectrophotometry.</b> The concentrations of boron and sulfur were significantly decreased in clinorotated shoots, while the concentration of sodium was elevated, suggesting that altered gravity conditions differentially affected nutrient uptake.

Atomic <b>emission</b> <b>flame</b> <b>spectrophotometry</b> {{was used to measure}} plasma sodium and potassium in sixty subjects, thirty smokers and thirty non-smokers as matched controls. The plasma sodium and potassium were analyzed before and after smoking in the smokers, while the analysis was done once in non-smoker cohort. There was a significant increase in sodium level immediately after smoking among smokers (p < 0. 05) and no significant change in potassium level. No change was found in plasma sodium level between smokers (before smoking) and non-smokers. In addition, there is a decrease in plasma potassium level among smokers (before smoking) in comparison to non-smokers; however, it is statistically not significant. This study reveals that cigarette smoking has an immediate increasing effect on plasma sodium level. It is recommended that cigarette smoking should be avoided especially before blood sodium measurement.

40|$|In this paper, spray {{combustion}} {{of diesel}} (No. 2) and diesel-gasoline blend (dieseline: 80 % diesel and 20 % gasoline by volume) were investigated in an optically accessible constant volume combustion chamber. Effects of ambient conditions on <b>flame</b> <b>emissions</b> were studied. Ambient oxygen concentration was varied from 12 % to 21 % and three ambient temperatures were selected: 800  K, 1000  K and 1200  K. An intensified CCD camera coupled with bandpass filters {{was employed to}} capture the quasi-steady state <b>flame</b> <b>emissions</b> at 430  nm and 470  nm bands. Under non-sooting conditions, the narrow-band <b>flame</b> <b>emissions</b> at 430  nm and 470  nm {{can be used as}} indicators of CH∗ (methylidyne) and HCHO∗ (formaldehyde), respectively. The lift-off length was measured by imaging the OH∗ chemiluminescence at 310  nm. <b>Flame</b> <b>emission</b> structure and intensity distribution were compared between dieseline and diesel at wavelength bands. <b>Flame</b> <b>emission</b> images show that both narrow band emissions become shorter, thinner and stronger with higher oxygen concentration and higher ambient temperature for both fuels. Areas of weak intensity are observed at the flame periphery and the upstream for both fuels under all ambient conditions. Average <b>flame</b> <b>emission</b> intensity and area were calculated for 430  nm and 470  nm narrow-band emissions. At a lower ambient temperature the average intensity increases with increasing ambient oxygen concentration. However, at the 1200  K ambient temperature condition, the average intensity is not increasing monotonically for both fuels. For most of the conditions, diesel has a stronger average <b>flame</b> <b>emission</b> intensity than dieseline for the 430  nm band, and similar phenomena can be observed for the 470  nm band with 800  K and 1200  K ambient temperatures. However, for the 1000  K ambient temperature cases, dieseline has stronger average <b>flame</b> <b>emission</b> intensities than diesel for all oxygen concentrations at 470  nm band. <b>Flame</b> <b>emissions</b> for the two bands have a smaller average emission area under higher ambient oxygen concentration and temperature for both fuels, while dieseline has a slightly larger average <b>flame</b> <b>emission</b> area than diesel for most cases. The experimental findings were further analyzed and discussed based on an empirical model of the distributions of air and fuel. Both experiment results and theoretical model show that dieseline has wider 430 nm and 470 nm band emissions than diesel under all conditions. © 2016 Elsevier Lt...|$|R

40|$|The {{objective}} of this work {{was to assess the}} feasibility of a photodiode to control combustion, instead of a spectrometer (which is an expensive sensor to be used in commercial burners). For that purpose, the <b>flame</b> <b>emission</b> has been measured in a hot-water boiler fired with light fuel-oil, whose nominal output power goes up to 370 kW. The parameters investigated were: overall air excess, combustion air distribution, burner power and atmospheric conditions. High influence of air distribution on the <b>flame</b> <b>emission</b> was detected by the diode, since it modifies directly the mixing quality reducing rich-fuel regions where soot can be formed. Low influence of air excess and burner power was found. When these parameters increase, the <b>flame</b> <b>emission</b> decreases. This behavior is explained by the better mixing attained at high burner power and at high air excess. However the high emission level observed at low firing rate can be reduced with a good burner adjustment. With the photodiode, it was possible to find the optimum air excess value where NO, CO and soot are as low as possible. As the photodiode measures locally in the flame, results were compared with images obtained with a CCD camera. Finally, these results are in good agreement with those obtained previously with the spectrometer...|$|R
