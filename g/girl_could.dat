5|$|The {{local police}} {{department}} {{reported that they}} received many tips suggesting possible identities for the child, those of missing girls throughout the country. Many readers online told police that the <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> be Aliya Lunsford of West Virginia, who disappeared on September 24, 2011. Lunsford would have been six {{at the time of}} the discovery and did bear a resemblance to the reconstruction of the Jane Doe, but she was later excluded from the case. The Massachusetts State Police later released statements on their Facebook pages regarding the exclusions of Lunsford, as well as Ayla Reynolds.|$|E
5|$|Decorating of the Bride {{is one of}} Jovanović's Orientalist works, notable {{examples}} of which include The Wounded Montenegrin (1882), Fencing Lesson (1883) and Cockfight (1897). The painting is undated, and it remains unknown exactly when it was composed. Petar Petrović, the curator of the National Museum of Serbia, dates it to ca. 1885–86. Art historian Lilien Filipovitch-Robinson writes that it was painted in 1888. What is known for certain is that Jovanović painted it in the mid-1880s {{on one of his}} travels through the Balkans. One source contends that it was composed while the artist was visiting the Ottoman town of Shkodër, in present-day Albania. Another version of the painting {{is said to have been}} created by the artist not long after the original, but is considered lost. An 1891 journal article describes this version as depicting two women decorating the bride, while to her left the bride's mother clasps her hands and cries with joy. This version is said to have shown a girl on the verge of tears standing by a door to the far left. On the right, a woman and young <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> be seen offering gifts to the bride. During conservatory examinations in 2009, it was discovered that Decorating of the Bride had been painted over a similar, earlier work. The artist appears to have shortened the right side of the canvas by about , altered the appearance of the interior, and slightly modified the left side of the painting. Save for the shortened canvas length, the right side of the painting is identical to that in the final version.|$|E
5|$|The {{academic}} {{debate about}} Anne's birth date focuses on two key dates: 1501 and 1507. Eric Ives, a British historian and legal expert, advocates the 1501 date, while Retha Warnicke, an American scholar {{who has also}} written a biography of Anne, prefers 1507. The key piece of surviving written evidence is a letter Anne wrote sometime in 1514. She wrote it in French to her father, who was still living in England while Anne was completing her education at Mechelen, in the Burgundian Netherlands, now Belgium. Ives argues that {{the style of the}} letter and its mature handwriting prove that Anne must have been about thirteen {{at the time of its}} composition, while Warnicke argues that the numerous misspellings and grammar errors show that the letter was written by a child. In Ives' view, this would also be around the minimum age that a <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> be a maid of honour, as Anne was to the regent, Margaret of Austria. This is supported by claims of a chronicler from the late 16th century, who wrote that Anne was twenty when she returned from France.|$|E

25|$|The broken toes {{were held}} tightly against {{the sole of}} the foot while the foot was then drawn down {{straight}} with the leg and the arch of the foot was forcibly broken. The bandages were repeatedly wound in a figure-eight movement, starting at the inside of the foot at the instep, then carried over the toes, under the foot, and around the heel, the freshly broken toes being pressed tightly into the {{sole of the foot}}. At each pass around the foot, the binding cloth was tightened, pulling the ball of the foot and the heel together, causing the broken foot to fold at the arch, and pressing the toes underneath the sole. The binding was pulled so tightly that the <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> not move her toes at all and the ends of the binding cloth were then sewn so that the <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> not loosen it.|$|E

25|$|Females {{who carry}} one {{copy of the}} {{defective}} gene are carriers with a 50% chance of passing the disease on to their sons. In order for a female to be affected, she would need to have two copies of the mutated gene, one {{of which would be}} inherited from her father. Males affected with LNS do not usually have children due to the debilitating effects of the disease. It is possible for a female to inherit an X chromosome from her unaffected father, who carries a new mutation of the HGPRT gene. Under these circumstances, a <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> be born with LNS, and though there are a few reports of this happening, it is very rare.

25|$|It was {{not until}} three years later, in 1851, that McCord essayed a longer poetic effort in Caius Gracchus, a tragedy in five acts. This showed a {{maturity}} and a greater care in preparation. The main source of the plot {{is the story of}} the Gracchi, which McCord follows rather closely. The play was probably never intended for the stage; it belongs to that class of classic closet dramas that were in vogue in the first half of the 19th century. The character interpretation is probably the strongest and most valuable work. Caius is heroic, and his girl wife is as winsome as a Roman <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> well be; the mob in its vacillations is accurately drawn, and Cornelia is a masterpiece. The probability is that the real Cornelia was a favorite heroine of McGord's. Their lives bear similarities in biography; they were called upon to make supreme sacrifices that were identical, and they endured with similar silent heroism.|$|E
25|$|The Jolson Story {{had been}} a huge hit in the United Kingdom, and Garrett and husband Larry Parks decided to {{capitalize}} on its popularity by appearing at the London Palladium and then touring the UK with their nightclub act. Its success prompted them {{to return to the}} country three times but the increasing popularity of television eventually led to the decline of music hall entertainment. Garrett was then cast opposite Janet Leigh and Jack Lemmon in My Sister Eileen, a 1955 musical remake of a 1942 film starring Rosalind Russell, when Judy Holliday dropped out of the project due to a contract dispute. The following year she and Parks replaced Holliday and Sydney Chaplin in the Broadway production of Bells Are Ringing during their vacation from the show. Over the next two decades she worked sporadically, appearing on Broadway in two short-lived plays (Beg, Borrow or Steal with Parks and A <b>Girl</b> <b>Could</b> Get Lucky with Pat Hingle) and a musical adaptation of Spoon River Anthology, and making guest appearances on The Dinah Shore Chevy Show, The Lloyd Bridges Show, and The Fugitive.|$|E

500|$|Among other {{theories}} about the case, early speculation was that the <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> have been murdered {{by a member of}} her family.

The fact that she had been disposed of along with personal items reinforced this theory. The fact that there were not yet any tips from relatives with information about the child supported the idea that family members were involved with the disposal of the body—and possibly with her death. Investigators feared for other children who may have been in the care of those that disposed of the body, as they could be in danger. A different theory held that the child's family members might also be deceased, having faced a similar demise.|$|E

500|$|Paine's Quaker {{upbringing}} predisposed him to deistic {{thinking at}} the same time that it positioned him firmly within the tradition of religious Dissent. Paine acknowledged that he was indebted to his Quaker background for his skepticism, but the Quakers' esteem for plain speaking, a value expressed both explicitly and implicitly in The Age of Reason, influenced his writing even more. As the historian E. P. Thompson has put it, Paine [...] "ridiculed the authority of the Bible with arguments which the collier or country <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> understand". His description of the story of the virgin birth of Jesus demystifies biblical language: it is [...] "an account of a young woman engaged to be married, and while under this engagement she is, to speak plain language, debauched by a ghost". Quaker conversion narratives also influenced the style of The Age of Reason; Davidson and Scheick argue that its [...] "introductory statement of purpose, a fervid sense of inward inspiration, a declared expression of conscience, and an evangelical intention to instruct others" [...] resemble the personal confessions of American Quakers.|$|E

It takes time before Lana is strong enough to finally tell Whitney the truth, in a video message, about the way she feels. The Talon, a local coffee shop co-owned by Lana, becomes her new grounding force as Whitney and her aunt have left Smallville. Kreuk thinks that it can be hard to believe that a sixteen-year-old <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> become co-owner of a coffee shop, but she believes that it helps to provide more independence for the character and establish her more within the show. Eventually, in order to really get to know herself, and find her role in life, Lana leaves Smallville for Paris. In season four, Kristin Kreuk felt like Lana is [...] "going a little crazy and is uncertain about her direction, and feels people aren't validating her beliefs".|$|E

The film {{became one of}} the biggest box office hits in India, earning , and grossed over [...] abroad, the biggest Bollywood success of all-time in the overseas market up until then. It was her fourth overseas top-earner in four consecutive years. The film tells the story of two unhappily married couples in New York, and an ensuing extramarital affair. Zinta played the role of Rhea Saran, an ambitious fashion magazine editor. She described the role as an attempt to shed her vivacious public image. The Indian Express concurred that this was successful: [...] "The lady has not just looked glamorous but she has walked with poise, sat with grace, smiled with composure and spoken with calmness.

The The Moving Picture News stated, [...] "As a sketch of country folk, admirable because it is true. The situations are well worked out. The conversion! Could it be? A New England church meeting would be a good place to exhibit and - ask questions." [...] Though the reviewer in the The New York Dramatic Mirror however disagreed that the premise was plausible, [...] "A [...] old deacon forms the complicating element in this rather conventional and rather improbable story. That a <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> become a comic opera star without the knowledge of her parents is a strain for the imagination. That a simple little dance like the one in the picture could effect such a conversion is another tax on belief. The acting is good, especially in the heroine's role. The deacon displays an unnatural tendency in such a stern character when he rapturously kisses the photograph of his daughter." [...] It is unknown if the character of Deacon Sanders is really a church deacon because the synopsis states Deacon Sanders is a farmer who is [...] "nearly as poor as he is religious".|$|E
500|$|Beckinsale next {{starred in}} an ITV {{adaptation}} of Jane Austen's Emma, playing Emma to Mark Strong's Mr Knightley and Samantha Morton's Harriet Smith. [...] "You shouldn't necessarily like Emma," [...] Beckinsale has {{said of her}} character. [...] "You do love her, but {{in the way the}} family of a teenage <b>girl</b> <b>could</b> be exasperated by her outrageous behaviour and still love her." [...] The programme was aired in autumn 1996, just months after Gwyneth Paltrow had starred in a film adaptation of the same story. Caryn James of The New York Times felt that while [...] "Ms.Beckinsale's Emma is plainer looking than Ms.Paltrow's," [...] she is [...] "altogether more believable and funnier." [...] Jonathan Brown of The Independent has described Beckinsale's interpretation as [...] "the most enduring modern performance" [...] as Emma. In 1997, Beckinsale appeared opposite Stuart Townsend in the comedy Shooting Fish, one of the most commercially successful British films of that year. [...] "I'd just had my wisdom teeth out," [...] Beckinsale later recalled of the initial audition. [...] "I was also on very strong painkillers, so it was not the most conventional of meetings." [...] Elley wrote of [...] "an incredibly laid-back performance" [...] while Thomas felt she [...] "just glows as an aristocrat facing disaster with considerable aplomb." [...] She narrated Austen's Emma for Hodder & Stoughton AudioBooks and Diana Hendry's The Proposal for BBC Radio 4. Also in 1997, she played Juliet to Michael Sheen's Romeo in a radio production of Romeo and Juliet, directed by Sheen.|$|E
