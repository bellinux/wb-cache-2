500|$|Mani Ratnam handled screenplays for a {{majority}} of his films. Lauded for his casting in each of his films, he claimed in an interview that [...] "I am not a director who performs and shows. I discuss the role, the scene with my actors and let them bring life to it". Right from the beginning of his career, his works were noted for their technical expertise in areas such as cinematography, art direction, editing and background score. For his debut film, he managed to <b>handpick</b> Balu Mahendra, Thotta Tharani, B. Lenin, and Ilaiyaraaja, leading craftsmen in their respective fields. As his career progressed, he worked with his childhood friend P. C. Sreeram and continued his collaborations with him until Geethanjali. In 1991 for his film Thalapathi, he chose Santosh Sivan and Suresh Urs—both newcomers to the Tamil film industry—to do cinematography and editing respectively. Both would later go onto become a part of his regular crew. While working on Raavan, Santosh Sivan noted [...] "any cameraman can hone his skills just working with [...] " [...] and described Mani Ratnam's films as difficult to film. From his debut project till Thalapathi, Ilaiyaraaja was his regular composer. The duo split due to some creative differences after the film. For his next film Roja (1992), he collaborated with debutant A. R. Rahman, who has been his regular composer for all his films till date. He has also worked with Rajiv Menon and Ravi K. Chandran, while switching between Sreeram and Santosh Sivan. Since Alaipayuthey, Sreekar Prasad has been his regular film editor.. Mani ratnam has always been very choosy when coming to casting actors for his films picking most of them from theatre background. All of his films are dubbed into telugu as most of them were well received. It’s a well known fact mani is reluctant to cast telugu actors in his films owing to their stereotypes in acting skills.|$|E

2500|$|The wingsuit flying {{sequence}} {{which is}} notably {{the most dangerous}} stunt in the film was filmed in Walenstadt, Switzerland and required five stuntmen (including the cameraman) flying in formation, while all weaved through narrow mountain passes, {{one of which is}} called [...] "The Crack", all at a speed of over 145 miles per hour. The production canceled planned flights on a number of days because of poor weather conditions, eventually completing it only after two weeks in August 2014. Core brought in Jeb Corliss, a professional sky diver, to help coordinate the scene and <b>handpick</b> wingsuit athletes to perform the stunt. Corliss and his team picked the best wingsuit pilots in the world, who have all made over 17,000 sky dives and have had 20 years of experience, including one thousand BASE jumps and thousands of wingsuit jumps each, to perform the jump. Corliss himself was {{going to be one of}} the fliers, but was not able to be, because he was recovering from a knee surgery after he tore his anterior cruciate ligament prior to the filming, while testing a suit. The five fliers includes two times World Wingsuit League champion and four times Guinness World Records holder Jhonathan Florez (cameraman, who died in July 2015), Red Bull Air Force former manager Jon DeVore (portrayed Utah), who previously worked on the wingsuit sequence for , and served as the aerial coordinator, Mike Swanson (Bodhi), Julian Boulle (Grommet), Noah Bahnson (Roach), and James Boole. DeVore knew that the sequence was going to be difficult to enact, especially in supertight, choreographed formations. Corliss himself was familiar with the place since he made a jump in 2011 from a peak just outside the Swiss town. A video of the jump titled [...] "Grinding the Crack" [...] uploaded to YouTube has been watched over 30 million times.|$|E
