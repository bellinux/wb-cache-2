5|$|Thus {{our actions}} are predetermined, and are causally {{related to the}} {{overarching}} network of fate, but nevertheless the moral responsibility of how we respond to impressions remains our own. The one all-determining power is active everywhere, working in each particular being according to its nature, whether in rational or irrational creatures or in inorganic objects. Every action is {{brought about by the}} co-operation of causes depending on the nature of things and the character of the agent. Our actions would only be involuntary if they were produced by external causes alone, without any co-operation, on the part of our wills, with external causes. Virtue and vice are set down as things in our power, for which, consequently, we are responsible. Moral responsibility depends only on freedom of the will, and what emanates from our will <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> no matter whether it is possible for us to act differently or not. This rather subtle position which attempts to reconcile determinism with human responsibility is known as soft-determinism, or compatibilism.|$|E
500|$|Next, Senator Daniel W. Voorhees of Indiana {{spoke on}} behalf of Thomas A. Hendricks, praising Hendricks as a {{candidate}} of national unity: [...] "o the South, who has been more faithful? To the North, who has been truer? To the East, who has been better, wiser, more conservative and more faithful? And to the West I need not appeal, for he <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> son." [...] The next few states made no nominations. When the roll reached New York, there were cries from the crowd for Tilden, and some confusion when that state's delegation made no nomination.|$|E

The Edge stated that businesses often seek to minimise their tax burdens. The move was criticised in the Irish parliament. The band defended themselves, saying approximately 95% of their business took place outside Ireland, that they were taxed globally because of this, {{and that they were}} all [...] "personal investors and employers in the country". Bono later said, [...] "I think U2's tax business <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> business and I think it is not just to {{the letter of the law}} but to the spirit of the law." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{a meeting}} at Arrowsic, Maine in 1717 Shute and representatives {{of some of the}} Wabanakis {{attempted}} to reach some agreement concerning colonial encroachment on Native lands and the establishment of provincially operated trading posts. [...] The Kennebec sachem (chief) Wiwurna objected not only to the establishment of settlements on their lands, but also the construction of forts, and claimed sovereign control of those lands. [...] Shute, who often rudely interrupted Wiwurna, bluntly reasserted British claims to the territory. [...] The Wabanakis were willing to accede to existing illegal settlements if a proper boundary was delineated beyond which settlement would not be allowed; Shute responded [...] "We desire only what <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>own,</b> and that we will have." [...] This ambiguous response, and the treaty that was ultimately agreed, did not satisfy the Wabanakis.|$|E
500|$|Cultura Profética {{has been}} {{described}} as roots reggae. The group has often made use of the moog synthesizer, an instrument commonly used in traditional reggae but is generally rare in contemporary reggae. Despite primarily performing reggae music, the group incorporates various other rhythms into its compositions, including those of Caribbean genres such as salsa. The song [...] "Reggae Rústico" [...] from Ideas Nuevas includes an extended soneo, an improvised call-and-response section common in the salsa genre, at its closing, calling for unity in reggae music. Additionally, the band's music features a strong emphasis on improvisation and polyrhythmic patterns. Rodríguez notes that [...] "We've developed what I think <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> genre. We don't consider ourselves a pop act but we do make popular music {{in the sense that we}} are supported by many people. People have finally understood what we do." [...] Leila Cobo of Billboard observed elements of jazz in the single [...] "La Complicidad," [...] additionally describing it as [...] "more mellow rock than reggae." ...|$|E

[...] He voiced his justification for the anti-sabotage amendment by reassuring the convention that 'if there is one thing in this country that can now check or disrupt the Socialist movement, it is not the capitalist class; it is not the Catholic Church; it <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> injudicious friends from within.'" ...|$|E

2500|$|Reepalu drew {{criticism}} in January 2010 for his statements that “We accept neither Zionism nor anti-Semitism.

[...] He also criticized the Malmo's Jewish community for its support for Israel, stating that “I would wish for the Jewish community to denounce Israeli violations against the civilian population in Gaza. Instead it decides to hold a [...] demonstration in the Grand Square , which could send the wrong signals.” Jewish leaders responded that the demonstration Reepalu was referring to was [...] "pro-peace rally" [...] arranged by the Jewish Community in Malmö [...] "which came under attack from members of a violent counter demonstration" [...] and accused Reepalu of [...] "suggesting that the violence directed towards us <b>is</b> <b>our</b> <b>own</b> fault simply because we didn’t speak out against Israel." ...|$|E
