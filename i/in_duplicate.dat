5|$|HIV-1 {{testing is}} {{initially}} by an {{enzyme-linked immunosorbent assay}} (ELISA) to detect antibodies to HIV-1. Specimens with a nonreactive result from the initial ELISA are considered HIV-negative unless new exposure to an infected partner or partner of unknown HIV status has occurred. Specimens with a reactive ELISA result are retested <b>in</b> <b>duplicate.</b> If the result of either duplicate test is reactive, the specimen is reported as repeatedly reactive and undergoes confirmatory testing with a more specific supplemental test (e.g., western blot or, less commonly, an immunofluorescence assay (IFA)). Only specimens that are repeatedly reactive by ELISA and positive by IFA or reactive by western blot are considered HIV-positive and indicative of HIV infection. Specimens that are repeatedly ELISA-reactive occasionally provide an indeterminate western blot result, which may be either an incomplete antibody response to HIV in an infected person or nonspecific reactions in an uninfected person.|$|E

25|$|In the past, these medical reports {{consisted}} of very abbreviated handwritten notes that were {{added in the}} patient's file for interpretation by the primary physician responsible for the treatment. Ultimately, this mess of handwritten notes and typed reports were consolidated into a single patient file and physically stored along with thousands of other patient records in a wall of filing cabinets in the medical records department. Whenever the need arose to review the records of a specific patient, the patient's file would be retrieved from the filing cabinet and delivered to the requesting physician. To enhance this manual process, many medical record documents were produced <b>in</b> <b>duplicate</b> or triplicate by means of carbon copy.|$|E

Weight was classified as: underweight (< 5 th), healthy weight (5 th– 89 th) and excessive weight (≥ 90 th).

Almost all of the weapons in the game have two modes of fire: a primary mode in which the weapon is used in a typical fashion, and a secondary mode which uses the guns in other ways, such as them being close-quarters melee weapons. Players can carry an unlimited number of weapons, and certain guns can be used <b>in</b> <b>duplicate,</b> one in each hand. Most weapons have a finite magazine and must be reloaded after a certain number of shots. Interaction with objects in the environment is via a single [...] "Use" [...] command. Enemies and players can disarm each other at close range, and the player can use this feature to steal weapons or knock foes unconscious. Damage taken during combat for the player and enemy units is location-based, with a shot to the torso causing more damage than a shot to a limb.|$|E

2500|$|Various tools {{have been}} {{developed}} to make hand-knitting easier. [...] Tools for measuring needle diameter and yarn properties have been discussed above, as well as the yarn swift, ballwinder and [...] "yarntainers". [...] Crochet hooks and a darning needle are often useful in binding/casting off or in joining two knitted pieces edge-to-edge. [...] The darning needle is used <b>in</b> <b>duplicate</b> stitch (also known as Swiss darning). The crochet hook is also essential for repairing dropped stitches and some specialty stitches such as tufting. [...] Other tools such as knitting spools or pom-pom makers are used to prepare specific ornaments. [...] For large or complex knitting patterns, it is sometimes difficult to keep track of which stitch should be knit in a particular way; therefore, several tools {{have been developed}} to identify the number of a particular row or stitch, including circular stitch markers, hanging markers, extra yarn and row counters. [...] A second potential difficulty is that the knitted piece will slide off the tapered end of the needles when unattended; this is prevented by [...] "point protectors" [...] that cap the tapered ends. [...] Another problem is that too much knitting may lead to hand and wrist troubles; for this, special stress-relieving gloves are available. In traditional Shetland knitting a special belt is often used to support the end of one needle allowing the knitting greater speed. Finally, there are sundry bags and containers for holding knitting, yarns and needles.|$|E
2500|$|... (2) In the {{etching process}} an {{enlarged}} {{image of the}} design is cast upon a zinc plate {{by means of an}} enlarging camera and prisms or reflectors. On this plate it is then painted in colours roughly approximating to those in the original, and the outlines of each colour are carefully engraved <b>in</b> <b>duplicate</b> by hand. The necessity for this is that in subsequent operations the design has to be again reduced to its original size and, if the outlines on the zinc plate were too small at first, they would be impracticable either to etch or print. The reduction of the design and its transfer to a varnished copper roller are both effected at one and the same operation in the pantograph machine. This machine is capable of reducing a pattern on the zinc plate from one-half to one-tenth of its size, and is so arranged that when its pointer or stylus is moved along the engraved lines of the plate a series of diamond points cut a reduced facsimile of them through the varnish with which the roller is covered. These diamond points vary in number according to the number of times the pattern is required to repeat {{along the length of the}} roller. Each colour of a design is transferred in this way to a separate roller. The roller is then placed in a shallow trough containing nitric acid, which acts only on those parts of it from which the varnish has been scraped. To ensure evenness the roller is revolved during the whole time of its immersion in the acid. When the etching is sufficiently deep the roller is washed, the varnish dissolved off, any parts not quite perfect being retouched by hand.|$|E
2500|$|In 1998 she {{appeared}} once again alongside Shahrukh Khan <b>in</b> <b>Duplicate,</b> {{the film was}} produced by Yash Johar and was directed by Mahesh Bhatt. The film underperformed {{at the box office}} upon its release. However, Chawla won much appreciation for her performance and her chemistry with Khan was also appreciated. A critic wrote [...] "Juhi Chawla is one of my favourite actresses and she is simply wonderful here. I’m not sure how she manages to keep a straight face through some of Shah Rukh’s more insane moments, but she plays Sonia as quite a serious career woman with a tendency to lecture in English. Although I do prefer her romance with Shah Rukh in Yes Boss they still make a sweet couple here." [...] The same year {{she appeared}} in Hrishikesh Mukherjee's swan song Jhooth Bole Kauwa Kaate alongside Anil Kapoor; her performance was appreciated by the audiences and critics alike. Rediff while reviewing the film wrote [...] "Only Juhi as the daughter is not based on any character from Hrishida's collection. She carries off her role with her inevitable chirpiness, and looks very good too. Hrishida was right when he told me that Juhi's serene face suited the kind of sacrifice she would make in the film. Only Jaya Bhaduri has managed that serenity in Hrishida's films." [...] However the film flopped at the box office. The same year she also appeared in Priyadarshan's rural drama Saat Rang Ke Sapne opposite Arvind Swamy. Though the film underperformed at the box-office, Chawla's portrayal of a gypsy met with immense critical appreciation. The same year she also appeared in the Malayalam detective comedy film Harikrishnans opposite Mammootty and Mohanlal. Her performance in the film was met with appreciation. The film received a great pre-release hype due to the combined screen presence of Mohanlal, Mammootty and Juhi Chawla. Harikrishnans {{turned out to be a}} blockbuster at the Kerala box-office, it was the highest grossing Malayalam film of 1998.|$|E
