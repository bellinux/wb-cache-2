I was in the water about five hours, as the shore was so rocky and the surf ran so high that a great many were lost trying to land. Nearly all those that took to the water without their clothes on were taken by sharks; hundreds of them were all round us, and I saw men taken by them close to me, but as I was dressed (having on a flannel shirt and trousers) they preferred the others. I was not in the least hurt, and am happy to say, kept my head clear; most of the officers lost their lives from losing their presence of mind and trying to take money with them, and from not throwing off their coats. - Letter from Lieutenant J.F. Girardot, 43rd Light Infantry, to his father, 1 March 1852.|$|E

Either Pedro II or Garcia <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> to secure Soyo {{in the hands}} of Count Paulo, who held it and supported the House of Nsundi from about 1625 until 1641.

25|$|The first Bulgarian Exarch was Antim I, who {{was elected}} by the Holy Synod of the Exarchate in February, 1872. He was {{discharged}} by the Ottoman government immediately after {{the outbreak of the}} Russo-Turkish War on April 24, 1877, and was sent into exile in Ankara. His successor, Joseph <b>I,</b> <b>managed</b> to develop and considerably extend its church and school network in the Bulgarian Principality, Eastern Rumelia, Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet. In 1895, the Tarnovo Constitution formally established the Bulgarian Orthodox Church as the national religion of the nation. On the eve of the Balkan Wars, in Macedonia and the Adrianople Vilayet, the Bulgarian Exarchate had seven dioceses with prelates and eight more with acting chairmen in charge and 38 vicariates; 1,218 parishes and 1,212 parish priests; 64 monasteries and 202 chapels; as well as of 1,373 schools with 2,266 teachers and 78,854 pupils.|$|E

25|$|Modern {{historians have}} {{estimated}} {{the size of}} Komnenian armies on campaign at about 15,000 to 20,000 men, but field armies with less than 10,000 men were quite common. In 1176 Manuel <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> to gather approximately 30–40,000 men, of which 25,000 were Byzantines and the rest were allied contingents from Hungary, Serbia, and Antioch, though this was for an exceptional campaign. His military resources stretched to putting another, smaller, army in the field simultaneously. After the death of Manuel I, the Byzantine army seemed to have declined in numbers. In 1186, Emperor Isaac II assembled 250 knights and 500 infantry from the Latin population of Constantinople, an equivalent number of Georgian and Turkish mercenaries, and about 1,000 Byzantine soldiers. This force of 2,500+ managed to defeat Alexius Branas' rebellion. The rebel army which could not have numbered much more than 3-4,000 men had been the field force sent against the Bulgarians. Another force of about 3-4,000 was stationed at the city of Serres.|$|E

500|$|The {{faculty of}} the Franz Liszt Academy {{included}} {{some of the most}} eminent Hungarian musicians, including Béla Bartók, Leó Weiner, Ernő Dohnányi and Zoltán Kodály. Solti studied under the first three, for piano, chamber music and composition respectively. Some sources state that he also studied with Kodály, but in his memoirs Solti recalled that Kodály, whom he would have preferred, turned him down, leaving him to study composition first with Albert Siklós and then with Dohnányi. Not all the Academy's tutors were equally distinguished: Solti remembered with little pleasure the conducting classes run by Ernö Unger, [...] "who instructed his pupils to use rigid little wrist motions. I attended the class for only two years, but I needed five years of practical conducting experience before <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> to unlearn what he had taught me".|$|E

Bloch had retired in 2004 to start a family, but came out of retirement in 2014, training with her Israeli teammates to qualify for Rio.

500|$|The {{song was}} {{recorded}} by the Kinks at least twice {{in the summer of}} 1964. The band's demo was in a [...] "bluesy" [...] style, while a full studio version recorded in June was slower and less emphatic than the final single. Although the band wanted to rerecord the song, their record company Pye refused to fund another session {{on the grounds that the}} band's first two singles had failed to chart. Ray Davies, however, hated the original recording of the track, threatening that he would refuse to perform or promote the single unless it was rerecorded. Manager Larry Page also refused to publish the original recording. When Pye stood its ground, the band's own management broke the stalemate by funding the session themselves. Ray Davies' adamant attitude on behalf of the career-making song effectively established him as the leader and chief songwriter of the Kinks. Davies later said, [...] "I was floundering around trying to find an identity. It was in 1964 that <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> to do that, to be able to justify myself and say, 'I exist, I'm here.' I was literally born when that song hit." ...|$|E

500|$|She took John back to {{her house}} and {{enrolled}} him in a local school, but after few weeks she handed him back to Mimi. Various reasons have been suggested for her decision, such as Dykins' unwillingness to raise the young boy, Julia's inability {{to cope with the}} responsibility, or a punishment forced on her by Mimi and her father for [...] "living in sin". Lennon blamed himself, saying later, [...] "My mother... couldn't cope with me." [...] He then lived continuously at 'Mendips', in the smallest bedroom above the front door, with Mimi determined to give him a [...] "proper upbringing". Julia later bought Lennon his first guitar for £5/10- (five pounds, ten shillings) after Lennon had pestered her incessantly for weeks, but insisted it had to be delivered to her house, not her sister's. As Lennon had difficulty learning chords, she taught him banjo and ukulele chords, which were simpler, and later taught Lennon how to play the piano accordion. Julia's banjo was the first instrument that John learned to play 'sitting there with endless patience until <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> to work out all the chords.' After Julia's untimely death the instrument was never seen again and its whereabouts remains a mystery.|$|E
500|$|From 1986 to 1992 Hill {{was one of}} the world's top sport climbers, {{winning over}} thirty {{international}} titles, including five victories at the Arco Rock Master. This coincided with the era when the leading female climbers caught up with the leading men. In 1990, at the final stage of the World Cup Final, she was one of three competitors and the only woman to reach the top of the wall—and the only climber to complete the hardest move. As Joseph Taylor writes in his history of climbers of Yosemite, [...] "at that moment Lynn Hill was arguably the best climber in the world, male or female". Hill describes this as her most satisfying win because her competition—Isabelle Patissier—received information on how to do the final climb from the men who had already finished it. Moreover, Hill was starting with zero points in the competition because she had made a mistake in the previous competition, so she had to win big or not at all (the World Cup consisted of a series of competitions in which the participants were given points for a variety of climbing techniques). [...] "It took all of my effort and concentration to pull through the route. The moves I had to make were really spectacular, but <b>I</b> <b>managed</b> to do them. I was so excited to get to the top... I proved a point about women and what we're capable of—a lot of the best men had fallen off that route." [...] As a professional climber, Hill was able during this time to support herself by doing what she loved; she made approximately half of her income from climbing competitions and half from sponsorships.|$|E
