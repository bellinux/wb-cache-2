40|$|Accurate {{gas turbine}} <b>engine</b> health <b>status</b> {{estimation}} {{is very important}} for engine applications and aircraft flight safety. Due {{to the fact that there}} are many to-be-estimated parameters, <b>engine</b> health <b>status</b> estimation is a very difficult optimization problem. Traditional gas path analysis (GPA) methods are based on the linearized thermodynamic engine performance model, and the estimation accuracy is not satisfactory on conditions that the nonlinearity of the engine model is significant. To solve this problem, a novel gas turbine <b>engine</b> health <b>status</b> estimation method has been developed. The method estimates degraded engine component parameters using quantum-behaved particle swarm optimization (QPSO) algorithm. And the engine health indices are calculated using these estimated component parameters. The new method was applied to turbine fan <b>engine</b> health <b>status</b> estimation and is compared with the other three representative methods. Results show that although the developed method is slower in computation speed than GPA methods it succeeds in estimating <b>engine</b> health <b>status</b> with the highest accuracy in all test cases and is proven to be a very suitable tool for off-line <b>engine</b> health <b>status</b> estimation...|$|R

40|$|The {{effects of}} {{adaptive}} task allocation on monitoring for automation failure during multitask flight simulation were examined. Participants monitored an automated <b>engine</b> <b>status</b> task while simultaneously performing tracking and fuel management tasks over three 30 -min sessions. Two methods of adaptive task allocation, both involving temporary {{return of the}} automated <b>engine</b> <b>status</b> task to the human operator ("human control"), were examined as a possible countermeasure to monitoring inefficiency. For the model-based adaptive group, the <b>engine</b> <b>status</b> task was allocated to all participants {{in the middle of}} the second session for 10 min, following which it was again returned to automation control. The same occurred for the performance-based adaptive group, but only if an individual participant's monitoring performance up to that point did not meet a specified criterion. For the nonadaptive control groups, the <b>engine</b> <b>status</b> task remained automated throughout the experiment. All groups had low probabilities of detection of automation failures for the first 40 min spent with automation. However, following the 10 -min intervening period of human control, both adaptive groups detected significantly more automation failures during the subsequent blocks under automation control. The results show that adaptive task allocation can enhance monitoring of automated systems. Both model-based and performance-based allocation improved monitoring of automation.

40|$|Abstract — The rapid {{progresses}} made in {{the area}} of intelligent transportation systems (ITS) call for high rate intra-vehicle wireless communications. Ultra wideband (UWB) and multi-antenna are both promising technologies providing high data rate. This paper evaluates the channel capacity of intra-vehicle singleinput multiple-output (SIMO) -UWB using the measured signals in the experiment. The channel measurement is carried out in two vehicles, a sedan Ford Taurus and an SUV GM Escalade, with different transceiver placements, beneath the chassis and inside the engine compartment. Both channel state information available to the transmitter (CSIT) and channel state information available to the receiver (CSIR) cases are involved in our results. The results reveal that the channel capacity remain unchanged although experiment settings changes, including vehicle type, <b>engine</b> <b>status,</b> and transceiver location; and that water filling fails to demonstrate its advantage as the number of receiver antenna increases.
