5|$|In {{homodyne}} detection, {{the interference}} occurs between two beams {{at the same}} wavelength (or carrier frequency). The phase {{difference between the two}} beams results in a change in the intensity of the light on the detector. The resulting intensity of the light after mixing of these two beams is measured, or the pattern of interference fringes is viewed or recorded. Most of the interferometers <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> fall into this category.|$|E

Those <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> include {{freestanding}} statues, busts {{and other kinds of}} permanent sculpture, memorials (excluding plaques without a sculptural element on buildings), fountains, murals, gates and exterior mosaics in the City of Westminster, except for those in the former metropolitan boroughs of Paddington and St Marylebone and in two of the Royal Parks of London, namely Hyde Park and Kensington Gardens. Separate articles list works in the aforementioned areas and architectural sculpture across the borough.|$|E

50|$|Retromer is not closely related, {{has been}} reviewed, and its {{proteins}} {{will not be}} described here. GGAs (Golgi-localising, Gamma-adaptin ear domain homology, ARF-binding proteins) are a group of related proteins (three in humans) that act as monomeric clathrin adaptor proteins in various important membrane vesicle traffickings, but are not similar {{to any of the}} AP complexes and will not be <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> detail <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article.</b> Stonins (not shown in the lead figure) are also monomers similar in some regards to GGA and will also not be <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> detail <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article.</b>|$|R

However, the necessity of a theorem equivalent to the one <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article</b> was not yet evident.

In 1904 he proved the three-dimensional case of our theorem, but his publication was not noticed.|$|E
25|$|A {{deductive}} {{system is}} sound if any formula {{that can be}} derived in the system is logically valid.

They also share the property {{that it is possible}} to effectively verify that a purportedly valid deduction is actually a deduction; such deduction systems are called effective.|$|E

25|$|The {{method of}} {{expansion}} <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> {{in which a}} gas or liquid at pressure P1 flows into a region of lower pressure P2 without significant change in kinetic energy, is called the Joule–Thomson expansion. The expansion is inherently irreversible. During this expansion, enthalpy remains unchanged (see proof below). Unlike a free expansion, work is done, causing a change in internal energy. Whether the internal energy increases or decreases is determined by whether work is done on or by the fluid; that {{is determined by the}} initial and final states of the expansion and the properties of the fluid.|$|E
25|$|In {{the normal}} {{anatomy of the}} hip joint, the root (the thigh bone) is {{connected}} to the pelvis at the hip joint. The almost spherical end of the femur head (the caput, or caput ossis femoris) fits into the acetabulum (a concave socket located in the pelvis). The bony surfaces of the femur head and of the acetabulum are covered by cartilage. While bones provide the strength necessary to support body weight, cartilage ensures a smooth fit and a wide range of motion. Normal hip function can be affected by congenital conditions such as dysplasia, <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article,</b> trauma, and by acquired diseases such as osteoarthritis and rheumatoid arthritis.|$|E

500|$|In 1968, at the International Convention of Christian Churches (Disciples of Christ), those Christian Churches that {{favored a}} denominational structure, {{wished to be}} more ecumenical, and also {{accepted}} more of the modern liberal theology of various denominations, adopted a new [...] "provisional design" [...] for their work together, becoming the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ). Those congregations that chose not {{to be associated with}} the new denominational organization continued as undenominational Christian churches and churches of Christ, completing a separation that had begun decades before. [...] The instrumental Christian Churches and Churches of Christ in some cases have both organizational and hermeneutical differences with the Churches of Christ <b>discussed</b> <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>article.</b> [...] For example, they have a loosely organized convention and view scriptural silence on an issue more permissively, but they are more closely related to the Churches of Christ in their theology and ecclesiology than they are with the Disciples of Christ denomination. Some see divisions in the movement as the result of the tension between the goals of restoration and ecumenism, with the a cappella Churches of Christ and Christian churches and churches of Christ resolving the tension by stressing Bible authority, while the Christian Church (Disciples of Christ) resolved the tension by stressing ecumenism.|$|E
