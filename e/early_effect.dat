25|$|He {{used his}} rations to buy Chess Praxis by Danish {{grandmaster}} Aron Nimzowitsch, a book which Petrosian later stated {{had the greatest}} influence on him as a chess player. He also purchased The Art of Sacrifice in Chess by Rudolf Spielmann. The other player to have had an <b>early</b> <b>effect</b> on Petrosian's chess was José Raúl Capablanca. At age 12 he began training at the Tiflis Palace of Pioneers {{under the tutelage of}} Archil Ebralidze. Ebralidze was a supporter of Nimzowitsch and Capablanca, and his scientific approach to chess discouraged wild tactics and dubious combinations. As a result, Petrosian developed a repertoire of solid positional openings, such as the Caro–Kann Defence. After training at the Palace of Pioneers for just one year, he defeated visiting Soviet grandmaster Salo Flohr at a simultaneous exhibition.|$|E
25|$|Buffett {{was born}} on December 25, 1946, in Pascagoula, Mississippi, and spent part of his {{childhood}} in Mobile, Alabama. He {{is the son of}} Mary Lorraine (née Peets) and James Delaney Buffett, Jr. In grade school years, he attended St. Ignatius School, where he played the trombone in the school band. Buffett's grandfather was a sailor, therefore he was exposed to sailing as a child which had an <b>early</b> <b>effect</b> on his life and later in his music. He later lived in Fairhope, Alabama. He graduated from McGill Institute for Boys in 1964. He began playing guitar during his first year at Auburn University before continuing his college years at Pearl River Community College and the University of Southern Mississippi in Hattiesburg, Mississippi, where he received a bachelor's degree in history in 1969. He was initiated into the fraternity Kappa Sigma at the University of Southern Mississippi. After graduating from college, Buffett worked as a correspondent for Billboard magazine in Nashville, breaking the news of the separation of Flatt and Scruggs.|$|E

40|$|Abstract. The {{present study}} aimed to {{evaluate}} the <b>early</b> <b>effects</b> of interspinous spacers on lumbar degenerative disease. The clinical outcomes of 23 patients with lumbar degenerative disease, treated using interspinous spacer implantation alone or combined with posterior lumbar fusion, were retrospec-tively studied and assessed with a visual analogue scale (VAS) and the Oswestry Disability Index (ODI). Pre-operative and post-operative interspinous distance, disc space height, foraminal width and height and segmental lordosis were determined. The <b>early</b> <b>effects</b> and complications associated with the interspinous spacers were recorded. The surgical procedures performed with the in-space treatment were easy and minimally invasive. The VAS scores and ODI were improved post-operatively compared with pre-operatively. Significant changes in the interspinous distance, disc space height, foraminal width and height and segmental lordosis were noted. In-space treatment for degenerative lumbar disease is easy and safe, with good <b>early</b> <b>effects.</b> The in-space system provides an alternative treatment for lumbar degenera-tive disease...|$|R

60|$|When Longfellow read verse, it {{was with}} a hollow, with a mellow {{resonant}} murmur, like the note of some deep-throated horn. His voice was very lulling in quality, and at the Dante Club it used to have <b>early</b> <b>effect</b> with an old scholar who sat in a cavernous armchair {{at the corner of the}} fire, and who drowsed audibly in the soft tone and the gentle heat. The poet had a fat terrier who wished always to be present at the meetings of the Club, and he commonly fell asleep at the same moment with that dear old scholar, so that when they began to make themselves heard in concert, one could not tell which it was that most took our thoughts from the text of the Paradiso. When the duet opened, Longfellow would look up with an arch recognition of the fact, and then go gravely on to the end of the canto. At the close he would speak to his friend and lead him out to supper as if he had not seen or heard anything amiss.|$|E
50|$|The <b>Early</b> <b>effect</b> in bipolar {{junction}} transistors {{is named}} after Jim Early, who first characterized it and published a paper on it in 1952. The <b>Early</b> <b>effect</b> in {{bipolar junction transistors}} is due to an effective decrease in the base width because of the widening of the base-collector depletion region, resulting {{in an increase in}} the collector current with an increase in the collector voltage. The same type of length modulation in MOSFETs is also commonly referred to as <b>Early</b> <b>effect.</b>|$|E

30|$|Moshirynia et al. [32] {{showed that}} NMFD {{combined}} with joint dictionary learning, introduced in Section 4.1. 2, {{works well for}} 1 -ch dereverberation.

This early positive-biasing of emotional processing could help explain why antidepressant drug treatments have a delayed clinical onset of action, but suggest that the delay may occur because of the need for further psychological rather than neurophysiological processing. The identification of these <b>early</b> <b>effects</b> suggest that we need to look earlier on in the treatment cascade to begin to understand the complex effects of these drugs and that understanding both cognitive and pharmacological effects of treatments may be an important avenue for future study...|$|R
