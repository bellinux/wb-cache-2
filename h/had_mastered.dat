5|$|The Lost Levels {{was first}} {{released}} in Japan for the Famicom Disk System as Super Mario Bros. 2 on June 3, 1986, following {{the success of}} its predecessor. It was developed by Nintendo R—the team led by Mario creator Shigeru Miyamoto—and designed for players who <b>had</b> <b>mastered</b> the original. Nintendo of America deemed the title too difficult for its North American audience and instead chose another game as the region's Super Mario Bros. 2: a retrofitted version of the Japanese Doki Doki Panic. North America first experienced The Lost Levels, as the Japanese sequel became known, in the 1993 Super Nintendo Entertainment System compilation Super Mario All-Stars. It was later ported to the Game Boy Color, Game Boy Advance, and Virtual Console (Wii, Nintendo 3DS, and Wii U).|$|E
5|$|In {{the autumn}} of 1857 Burne-Jones joined Morris, Valentine Prinsep, J.R. Spencer Stanhope and others in Rossetti's ill-fated scheme to {{decorate}} {{the walls of the}} Oxford Union. None of the painters <b>had</b> <b>mastered</b> the technique of fresco, and their pictures had begun to peel from the walls before they were completed. In 1859 Burne-Jones made his first journey to Italy. He saw Florence, Pisa, Siena, Venice and other places, and appears to have found the gentle and romantic Sienese more attractive than any other school. Rossetti's influence still persisted, and is visible, more strongly perhaps than ever before, in the two watercolours of 1860, Sidonia von Bork and Clara von Bork. Both paintings illustrate the 1849 gothic novel Sidonia the Sorceress by Lady Wilde, a translation of Sidonia Von Bork: Die Klosterhexe (1847) by Johann Wilhelm Meinhold.|$|E
5|$|Although Phra Candasaro {{had studied}} with many masters, and <b>had</b> <b>mastered</b> many {{important}} Pali texts, {{he was not}} satisfied. He withdrew himself in the more peaceful area of his hometown twice. Some sources state he also withdrew himself in the jungles to meditate more, but Newell doubts this. In the eleventh rains retreat (vassa) after his ordination, in 1916, he stayed at Wat Botbon at Bangkuvieng, Nonthaburi Province. Wat Botbon was the temple {{where he used to}} receive education as a child, a temple known for its peacefulness. As seen from Luang Pu Sodh's autobiographical notes, he reflected to himself that he had been practicing meditation for many years and had still not understood the essential knowledge which the Buddha had taught. Thus, on the full-moon day in the tenth lunar month of 1916, he sat down in the main shrine hall of Wat Botbon, resolving not to waver in his practice of sitting meditation, whatever might disturb his single-mindedness. That same night he experienced in meditation {{what became known as the}} attainment of the Dhammakaya, which marked the start of Dhammakaya meditation as a tradition.|$|E

5|$|In January 1891, Morris began {{renting a}} cottage near to Kelmscott House, No. 16 Upper Mall in Hammersmith, which {{would serve as}} the first {{premises}} of the Kelmscott Press, before relocating to the neighbouring No. 14 in May, that same month in which the company was founded. Devoted {{to the production of}} books which he deemed beautiful, Morris was artistically influenced by the illustrated manuscripts and early printed books of Medieval and Early Modern Europe. Before publishing its first work, Morris ensured that he <b>had</b> <b>mastered</b> the techniques of printing and secured supplies of hand-made paper and vellum which would be necessary for production. Over the next seven years, they would publish 66 volumes. The first of these would be one of Morris' own novels, The Story of the Glittering Plain, which was published in May 1891 and soon sold out. The Kelmscott Press would go on to publish 23 of Morris' books, more than those of any other author. The press also published editions of works by Keats, Shelley, Ruskin, and Swinburne, as well as copies of various Medieval texts. A number of the Press' books contained illustrations provided by Burne-Jones. The Press' magnum opus would be the Kelmscott Chaucer, which had taken years to complete and included 87 illustrations from Burne-Jones. Morris still remained firmly in an employer relation with those working at the Press, although organised outings for them and paid them above average wages.|$|E
5|$|The Matriculation exam tested {{candidates}} on five subjects: Latin, Greek, Mathematics, Science, and English Literature. By exam-time this dedication to his studies had paid off spectacularly; the 1887 Cape lists placed Jan third overall, {{with the highest}} marks in the Colony in Greek. In what had been by any standards a year of tremendous success the latter achievement was especially outstanding; a misunderstanding {{at the start of}} the year led Jan to believe that he would be exempted from the Greek exam – as a result it was a subject which he largely disregarded. Six days before the exam this potentially devastating oversight was exposed – there was now less than a week in which to catch up with a year’s study. Jan immediately shut himself away in his rooms, spending the next days in total seclusion, working from sunrise to sunset in the attempt to master the grammar and vocabulary upon which he was shortly to be tested. By the time of the exam this hard work had paid off. Within a relatively short period Jan had largely memorised his books and <b>had</b> <b>mastered</b> the Greek language to a remarkable degree.|$|E
