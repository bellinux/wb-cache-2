50|$|Historically in Sweden, it was {{the banks}} and the Swedish postal service that first saw a need that people should have <b>{{identity}}</b> <b>documents.</b> They issued <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> for anyone. To prove the identity for this, relative simple routines were used, like having bank account documents, driver’s licence or passport, being recognised by the bank staff or bringing a friend with an <b>identity</b> <b>document.</b> These routines were used for decades from the 1960s until the 21st century although the security routines were strengthened during the time. Swedish passports were banned as an <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> during several years because they were relatively easy to forge, and allowed again after they were made more secure in 1998. The driver's licences had enough security {{to be accepted by}} the banks and became the most commonly used <b>identity</b> <b>document.</b>|$|R

40|$|Under the {{influence}} of intelligence-led policing models, crime analysis methods have known of important developments in recent years. Applications have been proposed in several fields of forensic science to exploit and manage various types of material evidence in a systematic and more efficient way. However, nothing has been suggested {{so far in the}} field of false <b>identity</b> <b>documents.</b> This study seeks to fill this gap by proposing a simple and general method for profiling false <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> which aims to establish links based on their visual forensic characteristics. A sample of more than 200 false <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> including French stolen blank passports, counterfeited driving licenses from Iraq and falsified Bulgarian driving licenses was gathered from nine Swiss police departments and integrated into an ad hoc developed database called ProfID. Links detected automatically and systematically through this database were exploited and analyzed to produce strategic and tactical intelligence useful to the fight against <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> fraud. The profiling and intelligence process established for these three types of false <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> has confirmed its efficiency, more than 30 % of <b>documents</b> being linked. <b>Identity</b> <b>document</b> fraud appears as a structured and interregional criminality, against which material and forensic links detected between false <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> might serve as a tool for investigation...|$|R

50|$|<b>Identity</b> <b>document</b> forgery is {{the process}} by which <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> issued by {{governing}} bodies are copied and/or modified by persons not authorized to create such documents or engage in such modifications, for the purpose of deceiving those who would view the <b>documents</b> about the <b>identity</b> or status of the bearer.

5000|$|In many {{countries}} in Central and South America a Cédula de Identidad also known as cédula de ciudadanía or Documento de identidad (DNI) is a national <b>identity</b> <b>document.</b> In certain countries, such as Costa Rica, a cédula de identidad is the only valid <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> for many purposes; for example, a driving license or passport is not valid to open a bank account.

50|$|An <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> (also {{called a}} piece of {{identification}} or ID, or colloquially as papers) is any document which {{may be used to}} prove a person's identity. If issued in a small, standard credit card size form, it is usually called an identity card (IC, ID card, Citizen Card or Passport Card). Some countries issue formal <b>identity</b> <b>documents,</b> while others may require identity verification using informal <b>documents.</b> When the <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> incorporates a person's photograph, it may be called photo ID.|$|R
50|$|Other <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> {{sometimes}} used include a passport, an official birth certificate, an official marriage certificate, cards issued by government agencies (typically Medicare card), some cards issued by commercial organisations (e.g., a debit or credit card), and utility accounts. Often, {{some combination of}} <b>identity</b> <b>documents</b> is required, such as an <b>identity</b> <b>document</b> linking a name, photograph and signature (typically photo-ID {{in the form of}} a driver licence or passport), evidence of operating in the community, and evidence of a current residential address.|$|R
