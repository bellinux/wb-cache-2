Metallographic and image analysis techniques {{have been used}} to quantitatively examine the macro- and microstructural changes occurring with the addition of grain-refining agent. The results indicate that the AlTi 5 B 1 addition produces a fine and uniform grain structure throughout the casting and this effect is more pronounced in the slowly solidified regions. The initial contents of Ti and B, which are present as impurity elements in the supplied secondary alloy ingots, are not sufficient to produce an effective grain refinement. The combined addition of AlTi 5 B 1 and Sr doesn’t produce any reciprocal interaction under the present casting conditions.

40|$|Friction stir welding (FSW) is an {{efficient}} technique {{which can be}} used particularly for magnesium and aluminum alloys that are difficult to fusion weld. In this work AZ 91 D Mg alloy plates 3 mm thick were friction stir welded at different process variables such as rotational speed and welding speed. The range of rotational speeds varied from 1025 to 1525 rpm, and the welding speed varied from 25 to 75 mm/min. Good quality welds were obtained under 1025 rpm of rotational speed with the welding speeds range from 25 to 75 mm/min. The microstructure of the AZ 91 D alloy consists of primary α-phase, eutectic α-phase and eutectic β (Mg 17 Al 12) phase in the received condition (<b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast).</b> The original dendrite grain structure completely disappeared and was transformed to fine equiaxed grains in stir zone (SZ).

A series of casting experiments {{were carried out}} in which the Ti and B contents were maintained con-stantly at 0. 1 and 0. 02 wt % respectively. The inoculation level of yttrium was manipulated {{at the amount of}} 0, 0. 1, 0. 2, 0. 3, 0. 4 and 0. 5 wt%. Microstructural characterization of the as-cast A 356 alloy was investigated by means of optical microscope and its phases are detected by XRD. XRF is used to determine the contents of inoculating elements such as Ti, B and Y so that their actual optimal ratio in the casting can be approximated. The mechanical properties tested are tensile strength and hardness. The inoculation of yttrium was found to enhance the grain refinement effect of Al- 5 Ti- 1 B grain refiner and improve the mechanical properties. The optimal weight percentage of yttrium was discovered to be 0. 3. The grain refining efficiency of combining yttrium and Al- 5 Ti- 1 B on A 356 aluminum alloy was mainly attributed to the heterogeneous nucleation of TiB 2 and TiAl 3 particles which were dispersed more evenly in the presence of yttrium and also as a result of α-Al grain growth restriction by AlY 3 compound precipitated at grain boundaries during solidifica-tion...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. The {{technology}} of Laminated Object Manufacturing (LOM) {{is not very}} new. For hundreds of years wooden parts are built by stacking layers together. Nowadays also paper, plastic, ceramic composite and metal sheets are treated in layers. For the manufacture of prototypes and especially technical tools, e. g. moulds for <b>gravity</b> <b>casting,</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting</b> or injection molding, out of metallic foil however the low self stiffness of this material is a great challenge. In this case {{it is useful to}} produce the parts in a two step process. The first sub-process is the stacking of the layers, which can be realised by laser beam spot welding to determine the position of the layer in combination with generating the defined contour by a laser beam cutting process. This procedure is done in a fully automated machine where the CAD-file of the desired part and the building parameters like the laser parameters and the cutting velocity are needed as input. However the stability of the produced green part is insufficient for most kind of application. Hence, a second sub-process to enhance the mechanical properties of the part is necessary. This can for example be realised by high temperature soldering or by diffusion welding in a furnace with inert gas or vacuum. During these kinds of joining processes the green part is homogeneously pressed {{with the help of a}} powder bed and at the same time it is tempered for a defined term...|$|R
40|$|A Doctoral Thesis. Submitted in partial {{fulfilment}} of {{the requirements}} for the award of Doctor of Philosophy of Loughborough University. Engineering applications of the recently developed zinc-aluminium casting alloys have been restricted due to certain inherent disadvantages such as segregation. However, segregation can be overcome by thorough mh:!ng of the melt and close temperature control or by rapid solidification of the melt, which {{can be achieved by}} squeeze casting. A more serious problem exists in service if components are subjected to a modest temperature increase to about 80 °C, when there is a drastic loss of strength. It was therefore thought that the incorporation of ceramic fibres in the matrix could improve the properties of the material at modestly elevated temperatures. In the majority of engineering applications, stresses exist in more than one direction, so castings with isotropic properties are preferred and consequently reinforcement of composite in three dimensions would be necessary to maintain isotropic properties. An investigation was conducted to establish the influence of squeeze casting on the mechanical properties and structure of ZA- 8, ZA- 12 and ZA- 27 alloys. The relationship between these factors and controlled process variables such as die temperature and applied squeeze pressure was established. The mechanical properties of the castings at room temperature and the effect of ageing at 95 °C on tensile strength and dimensional changes were established. The results showed a substantial improvement in the tensile strength of the 'as-cast' squeeze cast alloys when compared with the 'as-cast' <b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> <b>cast</b> alloys. In the case of ZA- 27 alloy, squeeze casting significantly improved ductility, which is a feature of benefit for all composite systems. The results also showed that pressure and die temperature substantially affect dimensional changes of the alloys when aged at 95 °C. A major aspect of the research was the evaluation of the mechanical properties of the fibre reinforced ZA- 27 alloy at elevated temperatures. Short silicon carbide fibres were randomly oriented in the matrix to obtain isotropic properties by a technique involving squeeze infiltration, followed by remelting and dispersal in the melt using specially designed equipments. Squeeze casting was used in the final stage of the composite fabrication. Castings of squeeze cast composite (with up to 10...|$|R

40|$|The {{die casting}} {{process is a}} name given to metal casting {{processes}} that utilize metal molds or permanent dies. There are really several distinct processes included under the general name. The die casting process actually has three main sub-processes. These are: (1) permanent mold casting, also called <b>gravity</b> <b>die</b> <b>casting,</b> (2) low-pressure die casting, and (3) high-pressure die casting. The three processes differ mainly {{in the amount of}} pressure that is used to force the molten metal into the die. The advantages of such a process include high production rates, exceptional dimensional repeatability, low part costs, and less machining due to reduced casting finish stock. The great heat transfer rate obtained by means of metal molds can further refine and improve the final cast structure, and therefore the mechanical properties, of the castings. The disadvantages are design limitations due to metal dies, higher initial die cost, and longer lead time for die construction and for changes to the die caused by a casting design change...|$|E
