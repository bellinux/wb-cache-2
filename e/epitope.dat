40|$|AbstractThis {{study focused}} on {{identifying}} the conserved <b>epitopes</b> in a single subtype A (H 3 N 2) —as candidates for vaccine targets. We identified a total of 32 conserved <b>epitopes</b> in four viral proteins [22 HA, 4 PB 1, 3 NA, 3 NP]. Evaluation of conserved <b>epitopes</b> in coverage during 1968 – 2010 revealed that (1) 12 HA conserved <b>epitopes</b> were highly present in the circulating viruses; (2) the remaining 10 HA conserved <b>epitopes</b> appeared with lower percentage but a significantly increasing trend after 1989 [p< 0. 001]; and (3) the conserved <b>epitopes</b> in NA, NP and PB 1 are also highly frequent in wild-type viruses.

5|$|Although {{there are}} many diverse pathogens, {{many of which are}} {{constantly}} mutating, it is a surprise that a majority of individuals remain free of infections. Thus, maintenance of health requires the body to recognize all pathogens (antigens they present or produce) likely to exist. This is achieved by maintaining a pool of immensely large (about 109) clones of B cells, each of which reacts against a specific <b>epitope</b> by recognizing and producing antibodies against it. However, at any given time very few clones actually remain receptive to their specific <b>epitope.</b> Thus, approximately 107 different epitopes can be recognized by all the B cell clones combined. Moreover, in a lifetime, an individual usually requires the generation of antibodies against very few antigens in comparison with the number that the body can recognize and respond against.|$|E
5|$|In {{figure at}} left, the various {{segments}} {{that form the}} <b>epitope</b> {{have been shown to}} be continuously collinear, meaning that they have been shown as sequential; however, for the situation being discussed here (i.e., the antigen recognition by the B cell), this explanation is too simplistic. Such epitopes are known as sequential or linear epitopes, as all the amino acids on them are in the same sequence (line). This mode of recognition is possible only when the peptide is small (about six to eight amino acids long), and is employed by the T cells (T lymphocytes).|$|E
5|$|Responses are {{polyclonal}} {{in nature}} as each clone somewhat specializes in producing antibodies against a given <b>epitope,</b> and because, each antigen contains multiple epitopes, {{each of which}} in turn can be recognized {{by more than one}} clone of B cells. To be able to react to innumerable antigens, as well as multiple constituent epitopes, the immune system requires the ability to recognize a very great number of epitopes in all, i.e., there should be a great diversity of B cell clones.|$|E

40|$|Viruses employ various modes {{to evade}} immune detection. Two {{possible}} evasion modes are {{a reduction of}} the number of <b>epitopes</b> presented and the mimicry of host <b>epitopes.</b> The immune evasion efforts are not uniform among viral proteins. The number of <b>epitopes</b> in a given viral protein and the similarity of the <b>epitopes</b> to host peptides {{can be used as a}} measure of the viral attempts to hide this protein. Using bioinformatics tools, we here present a genomic analysis of the attempts of four human herpesviruses (herpes simplex virus type 1 -human herpesvirus 1, Epstein-Barr virus-human herpesvirus 4, human cytomegalovirus-human herpesvirus 5, and Kaposi's sarcoma-associated herpesvirus-human herpesvirus 8) and one murine herpesvirus (murine herpesvirus 68) to escape from immune detection. We determined the full repertoire of CD 8 T-lymphocyte <b>epitopes</b> presented by each viral protein and show that herpesvirus proteins present many fewer <b>epitopes</b> than expected. Furthermore, the <b>epitopes</b> that are presented are more similar to host <b>epitopes</b> than are random viral <b>epitopes,</b> minimizing the immune response. We defined a score for the size of the immune repertoire (the SIR score) based on the number of <b>epitopes</b> in a protein. The numbers of <b>epitopes</b> in proteins expressed in the latent and early phases of infection were significantly smaller than those in proteins expressed in the lytic phase in all tested viruses. The latent and immediate-early <b>epitopes</b> were also more similar to host <b>epitopes</b> than were lytic <b>epitopes.</b> A clear trend emerged from the analysis. In general, herpesviruses demonstrated an effort to evade immune detection. However, within a given herpesvirus, proteins expressed in phases critical to the fate of infection (e. g., early lytic and latent) evaded immune detection more than all others. The application of the SIR score to specific proteins allows us to quantify the importance of immune evasion and to detect optimal targets for immunotherapy and vaccine development...|$|R

Emerging {{data indicate that}} alternate reading frames (ARFs) of both human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) and simian immunodeficiency virus (SIV) encode CD 8 + T cell <b>epitopes,</b> termed cryptic <b>epitopes.</b> Here, we show that SIV-specific CD 8 + T cells from SIV-infected rhesus macaques target 14 <b>epitopes</b> in eight ARFs during SIV infection. Animals recognized up to five <b>epitopes,</b> totaling nearly one-quarter of the anti-SIV responses.

5|$|Specific {{antibodies}} {{are produced}} by injecting an antigen into a mammal, such as a mouse, rat, rabbit, goat, sheep, or horse for large quantities of antibody. Blood isolated from these animals contains polyclonal antibodies—multiple antibodies that bind to the same antigen—in the serum, which can now be called antiserum. Antigens are also injected into chickens for generation of polyclonal antibodies in egg yolk. To obtain antibody that is specific for a single <b>epitope</b> of an antigen, antibody-secreting lymphocytes are isolated from the animal and immortalized by fusing them with a cancer cell line. The fused cells are called hybridomas, and will continually grow and secrete antibody in culture. Single hybridoma cells are isolated by dilution cloning to generate cell clones that all produce the same antibody; these antibodies are called monoclonal antibodies. Polyclonal and monoclonal antibodies are often purified using Protein A/G or antigen-affinity chromatography.|$|E
5|$|Virtually all {{microbes}} {{can trigger}} an antibody response. Successful recognition and eradication {{of many different}} types of microbes requires diversity among antibodies; their amino acid composition varies allowing them to interact with many different antigens. It has been estimated that humans generate about 10billion different antibodies, each capable of binding a distinct <b>epitope</b> of an antigen. Although a huge repertoire of different antibodies is generated in a single individual, the number of genes available to make these proteins is limited {{by the size of the}} human genome. Several complex genetic mechanisms have evolved that allow vertebrate B cells to generate a diverse pool of antibodies from a relatively small number of antibody genes.|$|E
5|$|Larger drugs (>500 Da) can {{provoke a}} {{neutralizing}} immune response, {{particularly if the}} drugs are administered repeatedly, or in larger doses. This limits the effectiveness of drugs based on larger peptides and proteins (which are typically larger than 6000 Da). In some cases, the drug itself is not immunogenic, but may be co-administered with an immunogenic compound, as is sometimes the case for Taxol. Computational methods {{have been developed to}} predict the immunogenicity of peptides and proteins, which are particularly useful in designing therapeutic antibodies, assessing likely virulence of mutations in viral coat particles, and validation of proposed peptide-based drug treatments. Early techniques relied mainly on the observation that hydrophilic amino acids are overrepresented in <b>epitope</b> regions than hydrophobic amino acids; however, more recent developments rely on machine learning techniques using databases of existing known epitopes, usually on well-studied virus proteins, as a training set. A publicly accessible database has been established for the cataloguing of epitopes from pathogens known to be recognizable by B cells. The emerging field of bioinformatics-based studies of immunogenicity is referred to as immunoinformatics. Immunoproteomics is the study of large sets of proteins (proteomics) involved in the immune response.|$|E

40|$|AbstractThe use of {{polyclonal}} {{antibodies to}} screen random peptide phage display libraries {{often results in}} the recognition {{of a large number}} of peptides that mimic linear <b>epitopes</b> on various proteins.
