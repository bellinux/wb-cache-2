25|$|I {{have the}} {{greatest}} consideration for the goals which are pursued by the physicists of the latest generation which go {{under the name of}} quantum mechanics, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> theory represents a profound level of truth, but I also believe that the restriction to laws of a statistical nature {{will turn out to be}} transitory....Without doubt quantum mechanics has grasped an important fragment of the truth and will be a paragon for all future fundamental theories, for the fact that it must be deducible as a limiting case from such foundations, just as electrostatics is deducible from Maxwell's equations of the electromagnetic field or as thermodynamics is deducible from statistical mechanics.|$|E
25|$|That you say as {{a theologian}} that I am a universalist is evident, {{in the sense}} that I believe that Jesus was sent into the world to save the sinners that we all are. This is what I {{understand}} Saint Paul to say when he mentions that sin has entered the world through one man, Adam, and spread to all men, and that he calls Jesus the second Adam through Whom redemption entered the world for all men, and even as he says 'all of creation,' that the redemption of Christ is the victory of God over the Fall. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> great plan of salvation is universal, concerns not only all men but the universality of the world and that Jesus on the Cross has accomplished this Salvation, this reconciliation of men with God, that the 'chastisement' as Isaiah says is fallen upon Him to free men from the malediction of the Fall. This plan of God therefore seems to be collective, global, universal.|$|E
5000|$|When Robert Runcie {{announced}} his retirement as Archbishop of Canterbury in 1990, Habgood was {{regarded as one of}} the favourites to succeed him. The religious journalist Clifford Longley described him as [...] "the outstanding churchman of his generation", although noting that Habgood had described himself as too old. As preparations for the selection of the new Archbishop began, Habgood gave a television interview stating that he was interested in being considered as [...] "if <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is what the church really wanted and if <b>I</b> <b>believed</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is what God really wanted I would be under a strong obligation to say yes." [...] At the same time it was reported that Habgood was not popular among those close to the Prime Minister, Margaret Thatcher, who would make the actual recommendation to the Queen.|$|R

500|$|Pompeo's {{character}} {{has also been}} used to define the image a strong woman, Bustle previewing the 12th season wrote, [...] "Meredith Grey has always been capable of being on her own. [...] Grey's Anatomy is about Meredith's journey. Men and romantic interests {{are a part of}} her life, but they are not the priority. She doesn't need McDreamy. Grey's Anatomy doesn't need McDreamy. So even if the writers do decide to create a new love interest for Ms. Grey (Martin Henderson, perhaps?), it wouldn't matter. I have faith that the show's writers will do this storyline justice, because TV needs more strong single women — and Meredith seems like the perfect candidate." [...] The site added, [...] "This past season was almost a trial run for a McDreamy-less Grey's Anatomy. When Derek left for Washington D.C. to pursue his research, Meredith stayed behind and focused on her own career. She didn't chase him. Her priority were her children and the Grey Sloan Memorial Hospital. Meredith showed that she would never put aside her own dreams and aspirations for a man, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> won't change after Derek's death." ...|$|E
2500|$|In December 2009, Livni {{travelled}} to Paris and {{met with}} French president Nicolas Sarkozy. [...] "Time is against us," [...] she told reporters following talks at the Elysee Palace that also touched on Iran. [...] "We discussed the need to re-launch the peace process between Israel and the Palestinians, and <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is part of Israel's interest to relaunch the negotiations from {{the point at which}} we stopped basically a year ago." ...|$|E
2500|$|Livni {{became the}} first Israeli cabinet {{minister}} to explicitly differentiate Palestinian guerrilla attacks against Israeli military targets from terrorist attacks against civilians. In an interview on the US television news show Nightline, recorded on 28 March 2006, Livni stated, [...] "Somebody who is fighting against Israeli soldiers is an enemy and we will fight back, but <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is not under the definition of terrorism, if the target is a soldier." ...|$|E
5000|$|When former British Home Secretary David Blunkett {{published}} his memoirs in late 2006, {{it was revealed}} he had advised Prime Minister Tony Blair in late March 2003 to bomb the Al Jazeera television transmitter in Baghdad.

2500|$|While Flynn {{acknowledged}} {{his personal}} attraction to de Havilland, assertions by film historians {{that they were}} romantically involved during the filming of Robin Hood were denied by de Havilland.

It was there." ...|$|E
2500|$|Cleese {{allegedly}} defaced {{the school}} grounds, as a prank, by painting footprints {{to suggest that}} the statue of Field Marshal Earl Haig had got down from his plinth and gone to the toilet. Cleese played cricket in the First XI and did well academically, passing 8 O-Levels and 3 A-Levels in mathematics, physics, and chemistry. In his autobiography So, Anyway, he says that discovering, aged 17, he had not been made a house prefect by his housemaster affected his outlook: [...] "It was not fair and therefore it was unworthy of my respect... <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> moment changed my perspective on the world." ...|$|E

He says, “I had a vision during one of my morning ‘thought time’ — a vision to build a temple where a huge statue of Lord Shiva would stand, building faith, hope and belief for generations to come.

2500|$|After an {{internal}} Foreign Ministry document stated that some European Union countries were considering freezing a planned upgrade in relations with Israel, Livni, as opposition leader, {{wrote in the}} message addressed to EU foreign policy chief Javier Solana, the EU's external relations commissioner Benita Ferrero-Waldner, and the EU's current council president, Czech foreign minister Karel Schwarzenberg: [...] "You all know my commitment to peace between Israel and its neighbors and to the two-state solution, a commitment shared {{with the majority of}} the Israeli public. <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> kind of attitude, one which directly links an upgrade in relations with regional diplomatic progress, is overlooking the substantial gains that the upgrade could provide both to the people of Israel and the people of Europe." ...|$|E
2500|$|According to Salk: [...] "My {{intention}} {{was to go to}} medical school, and then become a medical scientist. I did not intend to practice medicine, although in medical school, and in my internship, I did all the things that were necessary to qualify me in that regard. I had opportunities along the way to drop the idea of medicine and go into science. At one point {{at the end of my}} first year of medical school, I received an opportunity to spend a year in research and teaching in biochemistry, which I did. And at the end of that year, I was told that I could, if I wished, switch and get a Ph.D. in biochemistry, but my preference was to stay with medicine. And, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> is all linked to my original ambition, or desire, which was to be of some help to humankind, so to speak, in a larger sense than just on a one-to-one basis." ...|$|E

Some said that Hasan did not commit the crime, {{but that it was}} committed by other US military personnel who then killed him and said that {{he was the one who}} did it. They are like those who said that the September 11 attacks were not committed by those who committed them, and that it too was a “conspiracy.” I am one of those whose ancestors came here hundreds of years ago. I am a black American, and I know that “denial” is the explanation of those who cannot explain what they see or hear, especially if they belong to a minority group and are not used to the US way of life. But we black Americans have passed these stages. We became involved in political action, and the President of the United States is now one of us. Perhaps I am saying what I am saying because I was a Christian, and became Muslim. But <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> issue is a temporary one, and we ask God to raise us from one stage to another." ...|$|E

2500|$|The first {{man-made}} object {{to reach the}} Moon was the unmanned Soviet probe Luna 2, which made a hard landing on September 14, 1959, at 21:02:24 Z. The {{far side of the}} Moon was first photographed on October 7, 1959, by the Soviet probe Luna 3. Though vague by today's standards, the photos showed that {{the far side of the}} Moon almost completely lacked maria. In an effort to compete with these Soviet successes, U.S. President John F. Kennedy proposed the national goal of landing a human on the Moon. Speaking to a Joint Session of Congress on May 26, 1961, he said [...] "First, <b>I</b> <b>believe</b> <b>that</b> <b>this</b> nation should commit itself to achieving the goal, before this decade is out, of landing a man on the Moon and returning him safely to the earth. No single space project in this period will be more impressive to mankind, or more important for the long-range exploration of space." [...] The Soviets nonetheless remained in the lead for some time. Luna 9 was the first probe to soft land on the Moon and transmit pictures from the lunar surface on February 3, 1966. It was proven that a lunar lander would not sink into a thick layer of dust, as had been feared. The first artificial satellite of the Moon was the Soviet probe Luna 10, launched March 31, 1966.|$|E

[...] Matter of fact, people of Manzanillo commonly use the altar of the Caridad del Cobra Virgin as a marriage altar signifying the dedication of Celia Sánchez to the Cuban Revolution. The monument is as if Celia Sánchez is wearing a dress, stiff and enormous, like the jeweled dress worn by the Caridad Virgin.|$|R
