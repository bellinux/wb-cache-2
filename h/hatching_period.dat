The mottled sand grasshopper {{relies heavily on}} its camouflaging colors for protection against predators. Most notably, the rear tibia is orange or red, and {{the inside of the}} femur is yellow with four darker bands. The wings extend past the end of the abdomen. The forewing is speckled or banded and varies in color, and the hindwing has wide bands of light yellow and black with a clear wing tip. The mottled sand grasshopper has an enlarged pronotal ridge behind the head that looks like a collar.

5000|$|The mature female lays {{variable}} {{batches of}} eggs, usually in damp soil or litter. Oviposition is slow; {{she takes a}} few minutes to lay each egg. The eggs are very difficult to find in the field because they are covered by sticky excreta containing soil that the female had swallowed. The eggs are spherical, pale yellow, and only {{about a quarter of a}} millimetre in diameter. Their resistance to both drought and cold has enabled the species to survive introduction from cool, moist conditions of Northern Europe, to Australasia and Southern Africa. In conditions of drought they simply enter a state of aestivation in the form of diapause in which embryonic development is delayed. The delay lasts till a period of soaking rain sets in or until irrigation begins.

40|$|Abstract. Oceanographic {{conditions}} and transport processes are often critical {{factors that affect}} the early growth, survival and recruitment of marine fishes. Sagittal otoliths were analysed to determine age and early growth for 381 jack mackerel (Trachurus japonicus) juveniles from Sagami Bay on the Pacific coast of Japan. Two separate <b>hatching</b> <b>periods</b> (December and February–March) were identified. They originated from the spawning grounds in the East China Sea. Early growth and developmental rates of December-hatching fish were lower than those for February–March-hatching fish. It is likely that these differences were determined in the Kuroshio Current during transport from the spawning grounds to Sagami Bay, and the lower December water temperatures in the bay. Origin and hatch dates of juveniles in Sagami Bay were in contrast to previous research on Fukawa Bay, where April-or-later-hatching fish from spawning grounds in the coastal waters of southern Japan constituted {{about half of the}} juvenile population. Management of these two jack mackerel stocks needs to consider these differences in hatch date composition and spawning origins, as these differences could affect early growth and subsequent mortality...|$|R

A., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMEHRST M. A., UNIVERSITY OF MASSACHUSETTS AMHERST Directed by: Professor Duncan J. Irschick Variation in {{temperature}} has {{a profound effect}} on many aspects of an animal’s physiology, behavior, and performance capacities. Although animals are capable of coping with a range of temperature, they are adapted to specific boundaries of temperature. In an era of global climate change, it is fundamental to comprehend how organisms will react in relation to temperature-related stress and how warmer environmental temperature will affect whole organism performance, as these traits are often crucial to survival. In this study, I examined the effects of temperature on time to <b>hatching</b> <b>period,</b> body length, and larval growth rate. Specifically, I address the following two questions. First, does an increase {{in temperature}} affect the duration of time to <b>hatching</b> <b>period?</b> Second, do temperature and the duration of the time to <b>hatching</b> <b>period</b> affect body length at the time of hatching, subsequent growth rate? Furthermore, I investigate the effects of temperature on larval locomotor performance by examining whether or not temperature can result in any impairment of locomotor performance variables (velocity and acceleration). Specifically, I wish to address the following question, does an increase in environmental temperature affect both larval maximum and average velocity and acceleration? In order to answer such questions I raised one egg cluster of Spotted Salamander, Ambystoma maculatum, in two different temperatures (15 °C and 21 °C). I maintained both the eggs and the resulting larvae in these different temperature regimes until the larvae had reached two weeks of age. I then examined the effects of temperature on body length, growth rate, and locomotor performance. I found that temperature does not have a direct significant effect on body length in A. maculatum. However, I found that temperature has a significant effect on the length of time to <b>hatching</b> <b>period</b> and that the length of time to <b>hatching</b> <b>period</b> is directly correlated to body length. I also found that temperature does not {{have a significant effect on}} larval velocity but does have a significant effect on larval acceleration.

One hundred and fifty eggs obtained from a red-legged partridge game farm were randomly allocated to three batches of 50 eggs each. Eggs were incubated at 37. 8 ºC during the first 20 days, and subsequently at 37. 0, 37. 4 or 37. 8 ºC until hatching. Fertility was 74. 7 % and a good hatching performance was obtained, characterized by 85. 7 % hatchability, 9. 1 % egg weight loss after 20 days of incubation, 13. 8 ± 0. 1 g chick weight at hatching, and 23. 2 ± 0. 1 days incubation length. Hatchability, egg weight loss after 20 days of incubation, and length of the incubation period were not affected by incubation temperature during the <b>hatching</b> <b>period.</b> However, hatching synchrony improved when the incubation temperature was increased from 37. 0 to 37. 8 °C (p< 0. 05).

40|$|The {{trade-off}} between egg {{size and}} number {{is one of}} the most discussed concepts of the life-history theory. However, little is known about social factors influencing this trade-off in eusocial insects, where queens and workers share energy investment in the brood. During the colony-founding stage, the founder queen produces eggs and also rears the first-brood offspring independently in the absence of workers. The larger colonies have more labor force for brood care, as workers feed larvae until independence, whereas queens need to increase oviposition rates as the colony develops. Thus, social factors, especially the number of workers, should influence the trade-off between egg size and number. The adaptive investment hypothesis predicts that queens allocate more resources to individual eggs in the colony-founding stage and reduce egg size with increasing worker number. We showed that queens produce smaller eggs in larger colonies in the termite Reticulitermes speratus. We found a highly significant negative correlation between egg-laying order and egg size in the colony-founding stage. The first-brood eggs in earlier laying order exhibited shorter <b>hatching</b> <b>periods</b> and developed into larger larvae. Production of remarkably large eggs in the early founding stage likely has great adaptive significance, as the timing of the appearance of the first-brood worker is critical to the survivorship of incipient colonies.

The residues directly affect the embryos, disturbing their normal development and causing pathophysiological and morphological changes. ...|$|E

The female lays 2-3 white oval eggs, which <b>hatch</b> after a <b>period</b> of 30 days. Both parents incubate the eggs and in turn provide for the chicks. The young fledge after about 75 days.|$|R
40|$|Pathogenicity of  Beauveria bassiana Bals. Vuill. (Deuteromycotina:Hyphomycetes) {{on various}} stages of eggs and nymphs of the green stink bug (Nezara viridula L.). The green stink bug (Nezara viridula L.) {{is one of the}} {{important}} soybean pod-sucking bug besides brown stink bug (Riptortus linearis) and  green stink bug (Piezodorus hybneri). Up to now, pest control mostlyrely on the chemical insecticides,  The objectiveof this experiment was to study the pathogenicity of Beauveria bassianaon {{various stages of}} eggs and nymphs of the  green stink bug.   Experiment was conducted in the laboratory of Entomology, Indonesian Legumes and Tuber Crops Research Institute (ILETRI) Malang, from January to June 2011. The treatments consists of various eggs and nymphs stages of green stink bug. The results showed that B. bassiana was able to infect the eggs green stink bug both of the newly laid and the six days old eggs.    As a results of this infection, 96 % eggs did not hatched.   The younger of eggs, the more susceptible to B. bassiana. The infected egg prolonged <b>hatching</b> <b>periods</b> to three days. B. bassianawas also toxic to all stages of  the green stink bug, especially to the first and second instarswith mortality  rate of 69 - 96 %. The nymph of third, fourth, ad fifth instar and adult  stage were more tolerant to the B. bassiana infection. This study suggest that one way to control green stink bug be  the use of entomopathogen B. bassiana againts their ggs or younginstar...|$|R
