25|$|Multiple {{arguments}} against this, by Pylkkänen and by Hole, state otherwise. Pylkkänen's argument, about low applicatives and high applicatives, states {{that on a}} syntax tree level, low applicatives have an applicative morpheme below the verb in a sentence and involve an additional v, or pronoun maker. <b>In</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> German examples, (40) is deemed ungrammatical due to the possessor-raising and misplacement of the pronoun maker, or lack of a bound variable interpretation. To Pylkkänen, (39) is considered a low applicative sentence, and grammatical.|$|E

25|$|<b>In</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{issue of}} {{antidepressant}} use, some academics have highlighted {{the need to}} examine the use of antidepressants and other medical treatments in cross-cultural terms, {{due to the fact}} that various cultures prescribe and observe different manifestations, symptoms, meanings and associations of depression and other medical conditions within their populations. These cross-cultural discrepancies, it has been argued, then have implications on the perceived efficacy and use of antidepressants and other strategies in the treatment of depression in these different cultures. In India antidepressants are largely seen as tools to combat marginality, promising the individual the ability to re-integrate into society through their use—a view and association not observed in the West.|$|E
25|$|Ira Shor, a {{professor}} at the City University of New York, provides for an example of how critical pedagogy is used in the classroom. He develops these themes <b>in</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> use of Freirean teaching methods {{in the context of the}} everyday life of classrooms, in particular, institutional settings. He suggests that the whole curriculum of the classroom must be re-examined and reconstructed. He favors a change of role of the student from object to active, critical subject. In doing so, he suggests that students undergo a struggle for ownership of themselves. He states that students have previously been lulled into a sense of complacency by the circumstances of everyday life and that through the processes of the classroom, they can begin to envision and strive for something different for themselves.|$|E

As part of the tour, U2 headlined the Bonnaroo Music Festival in Manchester, Tennessee in June. In rationalising the tour, the Edge cited the 2016 US presidential election and other world events for what he judged to be renewed resonance of The Joshua Trees subject matter. He said that <b>in</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> record's anniversary, [...] "things have kind of come full circle, if you want. That record was written in the mid-Eighties, during the Reagan–Thatcher era of British and U.S. politics. It was a period when there was a lot of unrest. Thatcher was in the throes of trying to put down the miners' strike; there was all kinds of shenanigans going on in Central America. It feels like we're right back there in a way. I don't think any of our work has ever come full circle to that extent. It just felt like, 'Wow, these songs have a new meaning and a new resonance today that they didn't have three years ago, four years ago.'" ...|$|E

[...] <b>In</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> insurance element, in Canada, the provincial single-payer insurance system operated with overheads of 1.3%, comparing favourably with private insurance overheads (13.2%), U.S. private insurance overheads (11.7%) and U.S. Medicare and Medicaid program overheads (3.6% and 6.8% respectively). The report concluded by observing that gap between U.S. and Canadian spending on administration had grown to $752 per capita and that a large sum might be saved in the United States if the U.S. implemented a Canadian-style system.|$|E
2500|$|Mixed Feelings {{is based}} on Cvetkovich's PhD dissertation, which she {{completed}} at Cornell University in 1988. It grew out of Cvetkovich's “own mixed feelings about a feminist politics of affect,” [...] and argues {{that the effects of}} affect are not always liberating; rather, affect can “call attention to and obscure complex social relations, and can both inspire and displace social action.” Thus, Cvetkovich's study is a nuanced exploration of affect and politics. <b>In</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> figure of “the transgressive and/or suffering woman…Cvetkovich traces the construction of affect as both natural and particularly female, and as therefore potentially transgressive and requiring regulation and control.” While Cvetkovich interrogates the way Marxist, feminist, Foucauldian, and psychoanalytic theories have engaged with affect, she also draws upon these approaches in her study. Important to Cvetkovich's argument is the idea that affect should not be viewed as natural, but instead as historical.|$|E
2500|$|<b>In</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> {{creation}} of Native Authorities at Oke-Imo, Ilesa in 1900 by Major Reeve Tucker [...] and the re-organization of North East District in December, 1912; [...] {{the separation of}} Ijesa, Ekiti and other areas on 1 January 1913 and the {{creation of}} Ekiti Native Authority [...] with its headquarters at Ado-Ekiti; it is obvious that conflicts and agitations for local autonomy had pervaded politics of traditional institutions in Ekitiland. When the British moved its administrative centre for Ekiti District to Ado-Ekiti in 1913 where the Ewi holds sway, [...] the change in political status of Ado-Ekiti spurred a desire in other traditional authorities across Ekitiland to further demand for local autonomies. The heightened struggle did not give credibility to the fact that Ado-Ekiti which was eventually picked was already the official and major administrative capital of Ekitiland since 1 January 1913, [...] nor did it occur to the agitators that it had over time become a second home for all Ekiti people irrespective of their hometown of place of origin. Hence, the struggle for relevance and supremacy which continue to rear its head is worth a fuller study and understanding to probably find lasting solutions.|$|E

2500|$|Before Deleuze, however, Sartre had {{presented}} his own theory of sadism and masochism, at which Deleuze's deconstructive argument, which {{took away the}} symmetry of the two roles, was probably directed. Because the pleasure or power <b>in</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> victim figures prominently in sadism and masochism, Sartre was able to link these phenomena to his famous philosophy of the [...] "Look of the Other". Sartre argued that masochism is {{an attempt by the}} [...] "For-itself" [...] (consciousness) to reduce itself to nothing, becoming an object that is drowned out by the [...] "abyss of the Other's subjectivity". By this Sartre means that, given that for the [...] "for-itself" [...] desire to attain a point of view in which it is both subject and object, one possible strategy is to gather and intensify every feeling and posture in which the self appears as an object to be rejected, tested, and humiliated; and in this way the for-itself strives toward a point of view in which there is only one subjectivity in the relationship, which would be both that of the abuser and the abused. Conversely, Sartre held sadism to be the effort to annihilate the subjectivity of the victim. That means that the sadist is exhilarated by the emotional distress of the victim because they seek a subjectivity that views the victim as both subject and object.|$|E
2500|$|The reredos {{has five}} tiers of figures {{and at the}} bottom some marble reliefs by Westmacott. [...] In the immaculately kept New College Archives {{are a series of}} sepia {{photographs}} of Hitch’s figures taken before they were sent from his workshop near Vauxhall to Oxford and in the archive's record 3140 are letters dated between 1883 and 1892 relating to the reredos and these include several letters written by Hitch himself. Some of these letters show the lengths to which Hitch went to ensure that his statues were true to life. In the instance of the statue of William of Wykeham we read how a mask was made of the Winchester effigy of William of Wykeham and then sent to Hitch so that he could be sure that he achieved an accurate likeness. <b>In</b> <b>looking</b> <b>at</b> <b>the</b> relationship between architect/designer and sculptor one is sometimes struck by {{the way in which the}} architect/designer received credit for a particular work with the sculptor very often getting little or no mention and one letter written by Hitch shows that this did matter to him. [...] In this letter he thanks the addressee for sending him a newspaper cutting, one assumes about the reredos, and notes [...] "They name the architect I notice but not the sculptor." [...] We also learn from these letters of the great care taken in the detail of each of the individual statues. [...] "St Peter carries the keys", [...] "James Minor a club" [...] and [...] "Simon a saw" [...] etc. etc. [...] A photograph of the complete reredos is shown below, another shows some of Hitch's carvings and a close-up of the statue of Moses complete with tablet and horns gives us a good idea of Hitch's ability as a mason.|$|E
