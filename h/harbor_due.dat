5|$|Many critics {{compared}} Nuka-World to {{a previous}} expansion pack for Fallout 4 named Far Harbor. Dan Stapleton (IGN) {{said that when}} compared to Far Harbor, the role-playing elements are far less developed, though he also said Nuka-World has a nice setting filled with surprises and battles. Nicholas Tan (Game Revolution) also believed {{it was one of}} the better expansion packs, albeit not having such an in-depth a story-line as Far Harbor. Paul Tassi (Forbes) preferred Far <b>Harbor</b> <b>due</b> to this expansion being light on story.|$|E
25|$|Burbank has a rich {{cinematic}} history. Hundreds {{of major}} feature films have filmed in Burbank over the years, but perhaps none more famous than Casablanca (1942), starring Humphrey Bogart. The movie began production {{a few months}} after the Japanese bombing of Pearl <b>Harbor.</b> <b>Due</b> to World War II, location shooting was restricted and filming near airports was banned. As a result, Casablanca shot most of its major scenes on Stage 1 at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios, including the film's famous airport scene. It featured a foggy Moroccan runway created on the stage where Bogart's character doesn't fly away with Ingrid Bergman. Bonnie and Clyde (1967) was also filmed at the Warner Bros. Burbank Studios.|$|E
500|$|Early in its duration, the {{developing}} storm brushed {{the coast of}} Honduras with light winds. In Jamaica, gusts approached hurricane force, while heavy rainfall damaged transportation in Kingston. The storm wrecked small houses and damaged the local banana industry. There was one death in Jamaica. The hurricane crossed western Cuba with winds estimated at 105mph (165km/h). This prompted officials to declare a curfew for the capital {{in the midst of}} political upheaval following a coup. A newspaper described the curfew before the storm as [...] "the most peaceful night in a week." [...] However, the government ordered soldiers in Havana to shoot anyone suspected of looting, and four looters were killed during the storm's passage. Heavy associated rainfall caused rivers to overflow in three provinces, flooding low-lying areas. In Cienfuegos, the storm destroyed several houses. Offshore northern Cuba, two United States ships took shelter at the port in Matanzas due to rough seas. High tides flooded the Havana waterfront up to [...] deep, and several boats sank at the city's <b>harbor.</b> <b>Due</b> to advance warning and evacuations, there were no direct deaths in the country, and 20people were injured.|$|E

30|$|The {{alkalinity}} {{brought in}} by the olivine is of great importance. It counteracts ocean acidification, and the contained bio-limiting nutrients, Si and Fe, enhance marine productivity thereby capturing additional CO 2.

500|$|The MSHD started {{studies for}} a freeway routing of US31 {{from the state}} line northward to I-94 in 1967. The first section northward to Niles was {{approved}} in 1972, and {{the remainder of the}} route was approved in 1981. Since then, MDOT re-evaluated the St. Joseph Valley Parkway extension east of Benton <b>Harbor,</b> <b>due</b> to environmental, economic, and historical site issues. One of the environmental concerns that was studied relates to the habitat of an endangered species, the Mitchell's satyr butterfly, which has its habitat {{in the area of the}} proposed freeway. The [...] habitat is home to the second-largest population of the rare butterfly. The freeway between Niles and Benton Harbor was planned as a series of five segments when approved in 1981. Since that approval, the butterfly was discovered in the Blue Creek Fen in the late 1980s, and it was listed as an endangered species in 1992. This listing stalled MDOT's planning and construction of the fifth freeway segment north of Berrien Springs. The United States Fish and Wildlife Service (USFWS) issued an opinion two years later that the project would jeopardize the species. MDOT was given permission to modify the previously approved freeway to cross the Blue Creek on longer bridges; the USFWS also required that any construction be done from elevated platforms, among other restrictions. In the interim, MDOT proceeded with construction of the southern portion of the last freeway segment, completing it northward from Berrien Springs to the Napier Avenue interchange in August 2003.|$|E

30|$|Coastal {{protection}} with olivine, {{instead of}} {{with the usual}} basalt blocks, will add alkalinity to the ocean and also provide places of interest to tourists. This makes this combined function of CO 2 capture and alkalinity provider also financially attractive. Rough stretches of beach covered with olivine grit can serve as natural tumbling devices, where nicely rounded green grit can be produced by the surf. These may serve for applications as diverse as chicken grit and covering material for driveways. Tourists may also find these polished marbles attractive collector’s items. Using the surf which is free of charge, instead of mechanical crushing and tumbling devices, is an additional modest saving. Another financial advantage is that olivine cargo ships can unload their olivine {{directly in front of}} the coast, thus avoiding <b>harbor</b> <b>dues.</b>|$|R

40|$|Of the {{xenobiotic}} endocrine {{active substances}} (EASs), tributyltin (TBT) {{has had the}} clearest link to an impact on aquatic ecology. Its release from marine antifouling paints had a drastic impact on dogwhelk populations in polluted <b>harbors</b> <b>due</b> to a masculization effect. 4 -tert-Nonylphenol {{is seen as the}} most significant of the industrial xenobiotic estrogen mimics, being implicated as the dominant endocrine disruptor in certain industrialized river reaches. Apart from hot spots associated with particular industries, the estrogenic alkylphenols, phthalates, and bisphenol A are present in effluent and receiving water at concentrations below that which would give cause for concern. Other more bioaccumulative compounds such as polybrominated flame retardants, dioxins, and furans may possess some endocrine active properties. The possibility of additivity effects may yet mean that low concentrations of xenobiotic EASs will need careful consideration. It is noted that considerable quantities of many of these compounds are often found in sewage sludge and sediments...|$|R
40|$|Recently, {{there are}} several {{problems}} in space, infra-structure, and facility in the contiguity of existing <b>harbors</b> <b>due</b> to the trend of enlarged container vessels. In this regard, the Mobile Harbor has been proposed conceptually as an effective solution for those problems. This concept {{is a kind of}} transfer loader of the containers from the large container ship to the harbor on land, which is a floating barge of a catamaran type. The catamaran-type vessel is well known for its advantage in maneuverability, resistance, and the effectiveness for working on board. For the safe and effective operation of the two floating bodies, a container ship and the mobile harbor in the near sea apart from the quay, robot arms, novel crane systems, and pneumatic fenders are specially devised with additional mooring facility or DP(dynamic positioning) system. The concept is to be verified through comparison and simulation studies under various environmental conditions. It is shown that the proposed concept is in general feasible but {{there are several}} areas for further investigation and improvement...|$|R

5000|$|The main {{objectives}} of the Klaipeda Port Project are to strengthen the long term competitiveness of this Baltic region port, and, to improve environmental conditions, by preventing spills, improving waste reception facilities, and monitoring environmental conditions. The two main components are: 1) Investments in civil works, which will include the rehabilitation of breakwaters at the port entrance, through detailed investigations, and, build an extension of both the northern, and southern breakwaters, to limit wave energy from entering the port. In addition, the channel entrance will be dredged, widened, and deepened, allowing a realignment away from the oil terminal, in accordance with international agreements. Specifically designed monitoring fenders will be installed, combined with steel mooring lines. Safe maneuvers will be ensured following the installation of a wave/current monitoring system. Studies will determine the requirements for marine environment protection, and the financing of necessary equipment, and training. 2) Technical assistance will be provided, through studies to estimate the appropriate level of land lease rates, to avoid cross subsidies with <b>harbor</b> <b>dues,</b> and review lease management contracting, and procurement procedures, and, will focus on privatization practices for port services, and management. Training will be provided for port pilots on skillful navigation practices. [...] The World Bank, December 2006 ...|$|R
