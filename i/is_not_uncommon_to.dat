5|$|The {{length of}} the {{peninsula}} makes accurate weather prediction difficult for the town; when driving down Melody Line, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find it sunny between one set of tunnels, rainy between another, and foggy between yet another. Ikata's position, stretching out into the ocean, also makes it a frequent target for typhoons.|$|E
5|$|Registered daffodils {{are given}} a {{division}} number and colour code such as 5W-W ('Thalia'). In horticultural usage it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> also find another unofficial division of 'Miniatures', which, although drawn from the other 13 divisions, have their miniature size in common. These are sometimes referred to by nurseries as 'Division 14'. Over 140 narcissus cultivars have gained the Royal Horticultural Society's Award of Garden Merit.|$|E
5|$|Quolls are {{carnivorous}} marsupials. They {{are primarily}} nocturnal, sleeping in hollowed-out logs or rocky dens and {{coming out to}} hunt during the night, though on rare occasions they can be seen looking for prey during the day. They are mostly ground-dwelling, but it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see a quoll climbing a tree. Quolls mark their territory several kilometres away from their dens. A male's territory often overlaps many females' territories, and male and female quolls only meet for mating. Quolls have communal toilet areas, usually on an outcropping used for marking territory and social functions. These communal latrines may have up to 100 droppings in them.|$|E
50|$|Cornered rats {{will attack}} and can deliver {{a very painful}} bite. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see a ratter left with only one eye in its retirement.|$|R
50|$|Like other trends, ōdachi {{were often}} in vogue, most notably during the Edo Period, so it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see the swords used in various ceremonies.|$|R

5|$|Throughout the world, {{different}} seasoning {{and spices}} {{are used to}} augment the flavor of fried chicken. Because of the versatility of fried chicken, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> flavor the chicken's crisp exterior {{with a variety of}} spices ranging from spicy to savory. Depending on regional market ubiquity, local spice variations may be labeled as distinct from traditional Southern U.S. flavors, or may appear on menus without notation. With access to chickens suitable for frying broadening on a global scale with the advent of industrialized poultry farming, many localities have added their own mark on fried chicken, tweaking recipes to suit local preferences.|$|E
5|$|Because of {{the highly}} skilled nature {{required}} for playing the agung, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see agung players have friendly rivalries during a performance, using tricks {{in an attempt to}} throw others off-beat. For instance, if the p’nanggisa’s elaborations are so elusive that the p’mals has a hard time ornamenting or if the reversed happens and the p’mals ornaments to the point the p’nanggisa’s performance is engulfed, the player that cannot keep up is usually embarrassed, becoming the butt of jokes. Normally agung players switch off after each piece, but during instances like this where one player cannot handle the part being played, players either remain at their gongs or switch during the performance. It is also possible for agung players to switch places with the dabakan after two pieces. Even though the players compete, they still understand they are a single entity, closely accompanying the melody, employ different variations without destroying the music’s basic patterns.|$|E
5|$|The {{large number}} of {{instruments}} that some bands rely on in recording their studio albums can be a hindrance for live performances. While Orphaned Land are able to perform onstage with twenty musicians in their homeland of Israel, they {{have to rely on}} a computer to replicate the roles of the guest musicians for concerts elsewhere. Some folk metal acts confine themselves to studio recordings and are not known to perform any live concerts. This includes Folkearth, and Falkenbach. Other folk metal bands expand their regular roster to include more musicians and consequently, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find bands in the genre featuring six or more members in their line-up. Some of the sextets in the genre are Schandmaul, Cruachan, Korpiklaani, Turisas, and Midnattsol, while septets include Ithilien, Subway to Sally, In Extremo, and Lumsk. Both Silent Stream of Godless Elegy and Eluveitie boast eight members each while the line up of Mägo de Oz totals nine performers. Even when a band includes members dedicated to folk instruments, they might still rely on guest musicians to further enhance their sound. As an example, Lumsk added thirteen guest musicians to the band's seven members on their debut album Åsmund Frægdegjevar. At times, guest musicians are known to become full-fledged members of the band, {{as was the case in}} Skyforger and Turisas.|$|E
50|$|The Mainz and the Pompeii are the {{two main}} {{classification}} types and served side by side {{for many years and}} it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find 4th century legionaries carrying the earlier model.|$|R
50|$|Due to the song's structure, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find that, {{during the}} life of the 1980s band, it was {{performed}} as the second and final encore, after Elephant Talk, especially on the Beat tour.|$|R
50|$|Another {{particularly}} popular belief was {{the power of}} the intact corpse of a hanged man, whose hand could cure cancers; indeed it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see mothers brushing their child's cheek with the hand of the condemned.|$|R
25|$|In Portuguese-speaking countries, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find {{surnames}} {{derived from}} names of countries, such as Portugal, França, Brasil, Holanda.|$|E
25|$|In fact, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see {{different}} {{lengths of}} commercial breaks from one station {{to the next}} even during identical programming. This occurs even though all Global stations have had their master control operations centralized in Calgary since fall 2006.|$|E
25|$|Because of {{the large}} size of the contrabass's strings, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see players using plectra made from a leather shoe or boot heel. The bass {{balalaika}} and contrabass balalaika rest on the ground, on a wooden or metal pin that is drilled into one of its corners.|$|E
50|$|Until the mid-20th century, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> {{hear the}} use of {{informal}} forms of address, Thee and Thou, {{as compared to the}} more formal You. Use of the informal form of address is now uncommon in modern speech.|$|R
50|$|The modular nature allowed these {{loosely coupled}} {{lightweight}} programs to start-up quickly with relatively small memory footprints. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> run several instances of the Model or Preview package, each working on {{different aspects of}} the same project.|$|R
50|$|Supermercados Gigante {{competed with}} several other chains, such as Soriana, Comercial Mexicana, Chedraui, Wal-Mart H-E-B, Falabella, Cencosud and D&S. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see Wal-Mart {{receipts}} around the store touting the fact that said items are cheaper at Supermercados Gigante.|$|R
25|$|Blaufränkisch is {{considered}} a high productive vine capable of producing high yields fairly easily. In some parts of Europe it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see it harvested at 100 hectoliters/hectare (approx 5.3 ton/acre). However over-cropping the vine {{has a tendency to}} produce thin wines with lots of green, weedy notes.|$|E
25|$|ODBC {{remains largely}} {{universal}} today, with drivers available for most platforms and most databases. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> find ODBC drivers for database engines that {{are meant to}} be embedded, like SQLite, as a way to allow existing tools to act as front-ends to these engines for testing and debugging.|$|E
25|$|Linked {{lists are}} among the {{simplest}} and most common data structures. They {{can be used to}} implement several other common abstract data types, including lists, stacks, queues, associative arrays, and S-expressions, though it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> implement the other data structures directly without using a list as the basis of implementation.|$|E
5000|$|Rita Crockett {{was awarded}} a Major League MVP award. Even while Crockett was pregnant, with {{daughter}} Marrita, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see her breaking boards at the 10' line. Rita Crockett {{is reported to have}} a 42" [...] vertical jump.|$|R
50|$|Women {{have always}} had an {{important}} role in the family and community. In the early history of Maldives, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> have a woman as a Sultana or ruler and it has been suggested that the society was once a matriarchy.|$|R
50|$|Historically, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> sell {{portable}} radios that featured AM, FM, and TV audio (VHF channels 2-13), {{with the weather}} band included some distance down the dial from TV channel 7 (after the U.S. digital TV conversion, these types of radios became mostly obsolete).|$|R
25|$|In {{churches that}} are monastic, {{there is often}} an {{emphasis}} on the saints that belonged to that particular order. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see religious paintings of the Blessed Virgin enthroned with the Christ Child and surrounded by numerous saints, including some of the 1st century, and some belonging to the particular Order who commissioned the work.|$|E
25|$|In some Tagalog regions, {{the norm}} of giving patronyms, {{or in some cases}} matronyms, is also accepted. These names are of course not official, since family names in the Philippines are inherited. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> refer to someone as Juan anak ni Pablo (John, the son of Paul) or Juan apo ni Teofilo (John, the {{grandson}} of Theophilus).|$|E
25|$|There {{are over}} 25,000 Japanese people in Hong Kong, so it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> hear Japanese conversations. More than 10,000 people in Hong Kong {{had taken the}} JLPT in 2005. Hong Kong-based R by R Production {{produces}} a television travel show set in Japan, which, as of April 2016, is broadcast on ViuTV. However, the language is often misused.|$|E
50|$|The {{activity}} in the air was very high, {{as more and more}} Nationalist air units were committed to the fight. It <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see aircraft in groups of thirty or more machines appear over the battlefield, and clash with equally big squadrons of opponents.|$|R
5000|$|Most of this concert's {{songs are}} [...] "extended", {{a prime example}} being [...] "Travelling Without Moving", which lasts for 3 minutes and 40 seconds on the album, and 12 minutes during the concert. Such [...] "extended" [...] {{performances}} <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> the band's live side.|$|R
5000|$|Married {{couples with}} the same last name <b>are</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon.</b> <b>To</b> sort out each family from the others sharing the same name, nicknames or [...] "paratsouklia" [...] have been established, and have stayed the same for generations. Many of these have funny, derogatory, or even obscure meanings.|$|R
25|$|There {{are over}} 50,000 Germans living in Turkey, {{primarily}} Germans married to Turkish spouses, employees, retirees and long-term tourists who buy properties across the Turkish coastline, often {{spending most of}} the year in the country. In addition, many Turkish Germans have also returned and settled, and it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> hear German being spoken on the streets of Istanbul by Turks.|$|E
25|$|In Finnish culture, nudism is {{considered}} to be a relatively normal way to live. It <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see entire families spending time together naked. Families may be naked while bathing in a sauna, swimming in a pool, or playing on a beach, and it's not unusual to see children playing naked in a kindergarten or family yard for example. Nudity as a whole {{is considered}} less taboo than many other countries.|$|E
25|$|Generally, {{the city}} is sunny during the year, but rain is fairly common during the spring and in the summer. The weather of the city, however, changes very constantly, because the region where the city stands is the zone where {{frequently}} three fronts meet. As consequence, it <b>is</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see temperatures as high as 35°C (95°F) and in the summer as low as 8°C (46°F) in the city and, frequently, thunderstorms.|$|E
50|$|Christmas puddings {{have very}} good keeping {{properties}} and many families keep one back from Christmas to be eaten at another celebration later in the year, often at Easter. Constance Spry records that it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> {{go so far as}} to make each year's pudding the previous Christmas.|$|R
50|$|La Pira was a Dominican tertiary, i.e. a lay {{member of}} the Dominican order, who took his Christian faith quite literally. In the years {{following}} the war, it <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon</b> <b>to</b> see him in public barefoot, having given away his shoes, clothing, {{and most of his}} salary.|$|R
50|$|While {{a cost of}} {{hundreds}} of dollars monthly for the leased line <b>was</b> <b>not</b> <b>uncommon,</b> <b>to</b> a business handling large volumes of calls from the larger city the cost may have been justified by long-distance toll savings {{at a time when}} long-distance was pricey and alternatives were limited.|$|R
