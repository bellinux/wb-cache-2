40|$|Philosophers <b>investigate</b> <b>the</b> {{nature of}} morality. And {{scientists}} study the moral judgments people make, the moral norms people enforce, and the systems of moral rules people embrace. What {{is the relationship}} between these investigations? The traditional philosophical view is that an unbreachable wall divides these activities. Philosophy and science investigate entirely separate domains. Philosophy <b>investigates</b> <b>the</b> normative realm – the true nature of morality. Science <b>investigates</b> <b>the</b> descriptive realm – how different people or groups of people think about morality and how they deploy moral norms and rules. Just as it would be absurd to <b>investigate</b> <b>the</b> nature of the heavens by exploring how different people think about the heavens, it would be absurd to <b>investigate</b> <b>the</b> nature of morality by exploring how different people think about morality...|$|R
