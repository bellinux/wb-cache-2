500|$|They {{are divided}} into five definable groups, with colored <b>group</b> <b>rate</b> marks {{designating}} the group to which they belong: Seaman, Fireman, Airman, Constructionman, and Hospitalman. One of three apprentice devices may be worn above the rank insignia, which denotes the sailor is an apprentice in a particular field and is {{in search of a}} rating to join. Sailors who have gone directly to a base, station, or ship without any specialized training are eligible to select a career field, and through correspondence courses and extensive on-the-job training, may qualify for a rating. This process is called [...] "striking for a rate". If an enlisted member has qualified for a rate, but has not yet become a petty officer, he is called a designated striker, and is identified by a striker's badge that displays the sailor's rating, along with his <b>group</b> <b>rate</b> marks. The serviceperson is addressed by one's group designation, if known (e.g., Fireman Jones, Constructionman Apprentice Smith); by the generic appellation [...] "seaman"; or by one's striker designation (Boatswain's Mate Seaman Watson, Culinary Specialist Seaman Recruit Johnson).Those that have completed the [...] "A" [...] school for Hospital Corpsman wear their caduceus above their stripes and substitute the word [...] "Hospitalman" [...] for [...] "Seaman" [...] in their rating titles.|$|E
500|$|A United States Navy enlisted rate {{indicates}} {{where an}} enlisted Sailor stands within {{the chain of}} command, and also defines one's pay grade. An enlisted sailor's rate is similar conceptually to a naval officer's rank. Only Naval Officers carry the term [...] "rank". The word rate refers to an enlisted sailor's pay grade, while the word rating refers to one's area of occupational specialization within the enlisted Navy. Associated with the enlisted pay grades is a numbering system from the most junior enlisted sailor ("E-1") to the most senior enlisted sailor ("E-9"). This enlisted numbering system is the same across all five branches of the U.S. Military. All E-1 through E-3 are known as Seamen. E-4 through E-6 are called Petty Officers. All E-7s are called Chief Petty Officer, E-8s Senior Chief Petty Officer, and E-9s Master Chief Petty Officer. Rates are displayed on a rating badge, which {{is a combination of}} rate and rating. E-2s and E-3s have color-coded <b>group</b> <b>rate</b> marks based on their career field. Personnel in pay grade E-1, since 1996, do not have an insignia to wear.|$|E

50|$|A US study, the Prostate, Lung, Colorectal, and Ovarian (PLCO) Cancer Screening Trial, {{looked at}} the general {{effectiveness}} of a screening program involving both PSA and DRE methods. This was conducted between 1993 thu 2001, in which 76,693 men at 10 U.S. study centers 38,343 subjects received screening (an annual PSA testing for 6 years and DRE for 4 years) and a control group of 38,350 subjects received usual care with subjects and health care providers receiving the results and deciding {{on the type of}} follow-up evaluation. Usual care means that some in this group would have received some screening, as some organizations have recommended. After 7 years of follow-up, the incidence of prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 116 (2,820 cancers) in the screening group and 95 (2,322 cancers) in the control group. The incidence of death attributed to prostate cancer per 10,000 person-years was 2.0 (50 deaths) in the screening group and 1.7 (44 deaths) in the control <b>group</b> (<b>rate</b> ratio, 1.13; 95% CI, 0.75 to 1.70). The data at 10 years were 67% complete and consistent with these overall findings. The researchers concluded that after 7 to 10 years of follow-up, the rate of death from prostate cancer was very low and did not differ significantly between the two study groups.|$|E
50|$|Additionally, they {{organize}} {{an annual}} trip each May to Anime North (AN) in Toronto, Canada's largest anime convention. The travel group {{is open to}} anyone, not just Otakuthon attendees. The Otakuthon staff and volunteers assigned to this trip, which act as brokers, receive trip signups and trip money from travelers, {{which is used to}} reserve chartered buses, book hotel rooms and make group registrations for the con. This travel group from Montreal is the largest, single group registration for Anime North, at about 50 people. Otakuthon's annual Anime North trip provides a cost-effective, centrally-managed opportunity for Montrealers to attend AN without the hassle of figuring out every detail of the trip, competing for hotel room bookings, getting together a group large enough to qualify for Anime North's <b>group</b> <b>rate,</b> and determining an itinerary from Montreal to the con's area, which is outside of downtown Toronto, requiring commuting or a taxi ride if the method of transport chosen is by bus or train, which have their terminals downtown. (Car travelers can drive directly to the con, while air travelers can land at Toronto Pearson International Airport, which is next to the con.) Signups for the trip usually open in January of each year.|$|E
40|$|While {{community}} groups have often helped people cope with stress, little empirical {{research has been}} available to guide their use in prevention or treatment. To partly fill this gap, an empirical taxonomy of {{community groups}} was derived from ratings of 41 randomly selected groups on 35 dimensions of Group Structure, function, and Membership Characteristics. Cluster analysis defined five types. By comparison with other associations, Self-Interest (e. g., liberation and minority) <b>groups</b> <b>rated</b> lower in regulations and had members who were newer to the community. Self-Help groups were highly regulated settings providing support, integration, and developmental aids. Their members had few social relations apart from the family.

5000|$|In 1972, {{the current}} Coast Guard Dress Blue uniform was {{introduced}} for wear by both officers and enlisted personnel; the transition was completed during 1974. Relatively similar in appearance to the old-style U.S. Air Force uniforms, the uniform {{consists of a}} blue four-pocket single breasted jacket and trousers in a slightly darker shade. A light-blue button-up shirt with a pointed collar, two front button-flap pockets, enhanced shoulder boards for officers, and pin-on collar insignia for Chief Petty Officers and enlisted personnel is worn when in shirt-sleeve order (known as Tropical Blue). It {{is similar to the}} World War II-era uniforms worn by Coast Guard Surfmen. Officer rank insignia parallels that of the U.S. Navy but with the gold Navy [...] "line" [...] star being replaced with the gold Coast Guard Shield and with the Navy blue background color replaced by Coast Guard blue. Enlisted rank insignia is also similar to the Navy with the Coast Guard shield replacing the eagle on collar and cap devices. <b>Group</b> <b>Rate</b> marks (stripes) for junior enlisted members (E-3 and below) also follow U. S. Navy convention with white for seaman, red for fireman, and green for airman. In a departure from the U. S.

Unlike the U.S. Navy, officers and CPO's do not wear khaki; all personnel wear the same color uniform. See USCG Uniform Regulations 5 for current regulations.|$|E

40|$|In {{this paper}} we compare the uplink {{performance}} of various deployment scenarios in the planar (hexagonal) cellular system where the received signals at multiple cells are jointly processed by a central processor. A mathematical {{model of the}} planar cellular system is presented and its performance metric is based on information theoretic sum rate, and <b>group</b> <b>rate</b> share. The system deployment is as follows; {{the density of the}} base station is decreased, relay node replaces alternate base stations and in the last scenario, alternate bases stations are removed while the left over base stations are equipped with an additional antenna. It is observed that in reduction in the density of base stations resulted in reduction in the achievable sum rate and makes the <b>group</b> <b>rate</b> unfair. The introduction of additional antenna resulted in an improvement in the rate (compared with the reduction in density scenario) without any improvement in <b>group</b> <b>rate</b> fairness to cell user at the cell edge. The replacement of base stations with relay node and the implementation of orthogonal amplify and forward scheme resulted in a reduction in the achievable sum rate however it produced a significant improvement in <b>group</b> <b>rate</b> fairness.
