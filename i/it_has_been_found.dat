5|$|The {{range of}} Miniopterus mahafaliensis extends through southwestern Madagascar in the spiny forest and dry forest, often {{but not always}} near caves; <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> on the Mahafaly Plateau, in the Forêt des Mikea, and the Kirindy Mitea National Park. Further inland, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in {{disturbed}} gallery forest in Isalo National Park, in a cave in savanna habitat near Ihosy, and in unspecified habitat at Betroka. Little is known of the ecology of M.mahafaliensis, but species of Miniopterus generally feed on insects, breed seasonally, and roost in large colonies in caves.|$|E
5|$|Angle-resolved low-coherence {{interferometry}} (a/LCI) uses {{scattered light}} {{to measure the}} sizes of subcellular objects, including cell nuclei. This allows interferometry depth measurements to be combined with density measurements. Various correlations have been found between the state of tissue health and the measurements of subcellular objects. For example, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> that as tissue changes from normal to cancerous, the average cell nuclei size increases.|$|E
5|$|Bicycles {{have been}} constructed, for {{investigation}} and demonstration purposes, with the steering reversed so that turning the handlebars {{to the left}} causes the front wheel {{to turn to the}} right, and vica versa. It is possible to ride such a bicycle, but <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> that riders experienced with normal bicycles find it very difficult to learn, if they can manage it at all.|$|E

5|$|In Europe, {{it is one}} of 32 {{threatened}} species proposed for protection under the Bern Convention. It has been recorded from Czechoslovakia, and Poland, where it is mostly found in old-growth forests. It is rare in northern Europe, where <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in Finland growing on Picea abies and Alnus incana, and in Sweden.|$|E
5|$|Pope Gregory's {{plan had}} been that York would be England's second {{metropolitan}} see, so Paulinus established his church there. Although built of stone, no trace of <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found.</b> Paulinus also built a number of churches on royal estates. His church in Lincoln has been identified with the earliest building phase {{of the church of}} St Paul in the Bail.|$|E
5|$|Saproamanita thiersii inhabits lawns, {{pastures}} and prairies throughout the Mississippi River Basin. It often forms fairy rings or arcs but also sometimes fruits as isolated specimens. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> {{growing in the}} same lawn as Chlorophyllum molybdites. Analysis using stable carbon isotopes has proved that this mushroom is saprotrophic in nature, unlike the other mycorrhizal Amanitas.|$|E

5|$|The {{densities of}} wood turtle populations {{have also been}} studied. In the {{northern}} portion of its range (Quebec and other areas of Canada), populations are fairly dilute, containing an average of 0.44 individuals per , while in the south, over the same area, the densities varied largely from 6 to 90 turtles. In addition to this, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> that colonies often have more females than males.|$|E
5|$|The fungus {{probably}} favours calcareous soil, although <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> {{on nearly}} every soil type. It appears on sand, peat, limestone soils, rankers and Cambisols. It endures acidic as well as alkaline and low-nutrient to relatively high-nutrient soils. Heavily eutrophic soils are inappropriate for its habitat.|$|E
5|$|Women are {{negatively}} {{affected by the}} geographic bias within implementation of the current healthcare system in India. Of all health workers in the country, nearly two thirds are men. This especially affects rural areas where <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> that out of all doctors, only 6 percent are women. This translates into approximately 0.5 female allopathic physicians per 10,000 individuals in rural areas.|$|E

5|$|Barnacles are {{normally}} sessile animals unable to evade predators. When they {{are attached to}} a scallop they benefit from the defence response of the mollusc to threats which enables it to avoid predation. The scallop is disadvantaged because the presence of barnacles may reduce its ability to swim. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> that encrusting sponges emit chemicals that discourage barnacle larvae from settling nearby. The larvae preferentially settle on shells that are not encrusted with sponges. This is another way in which encrusting sponges are of advantage to the scallops which are less impeded {{in their ability to}} swim by sponges than they are by barnacles.|$|E
5|$|Because of the {{presence}} of auxins in Lactifluus piperatus metabolites, it can be applied as a rooting hormone to aid the growth of seedlings of various species of plants, including hazel, beech and oak. In the 19th century, it was used as a folk cure for tuberculosis, though it had no effect. In more recent times, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> that L. piperatus can be used as an antiviral agent, and the latex has been used against viral warts.|$|E
5|$|Drymoreomys albimaculatus {{appears to}} be a {{specialist}} of dense, moist, montane and premontane forest. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in disturbed and secondary forests as well as in pristine forest, but probably needs contiguous forest to survive. Reproductive activity has been observed in females in June, November, and December and in males in December, suggesting that the species breeds year-round. Although some of its morphological traits, such as the very large pads, are suggestive of arboreal (tree-dwelling) habits, most specimens were collected in pitfall traps on the ground.|$|E

5|$|Hemilepistus reaumuri is an {{important}} part of the desert ecosystem. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> at population densities of up to 480,000 individuals per hectare, which is equivalent to a biomass of 19.2kg/ha; in comparison, desert mammals are estimated to have a combined biomass of 39.9kg/ha. The main predator of H. reaumuri is the scorpion Scorpio maurus, and it may compose up to 70% of the scorpion's diet. It appears to be vulnerable to attack only on the surface; no predators are known to attack H. reaumuri in its underground burrows.|$|E
5|$|Hunting {{areas are}} often located 100km (60mi) or more, {{offshore}} from the nest sites, although when feeding their young, the birds venture out only half that distance. <b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> that adults bringing fish to their chicks tend {{to arrive in}} groups. This is thought to benefit the bird by reducing kleptoparasitism by the Arctic skua which harasses puffins until they drop their fish loads. Predation by the great skua (Catharacta skua) is also reduced by several birds arriving simultaneously.|$|E
5|$|In North America, {{the fungus}} has been {{recorded}} in North Carolina, Tennessee, New York, Michigan, Montana, Idaho, Washington, Oregon, California, Virginia, and South Dakota. In Canada, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in Ontario. Smith noted that collections from Michigan {{are likely to be}} found on old hemlock knots lying in the soil, where it usually fruits singly; it tends to grow in clusters on logs and stumps. In Europe, it {{has been recorded}} from Britain, Scotland, the Czech Republic, Poland, Germany, and Turkey. In the UK, the fungus is commonly found in Caledonian pine woods, and it is considered an indicator species for that habitat type.|$|E

5|$|In benign infections {{found in}} some wild and captive African elephants, these viruses can affect either the skin or the {{pulmonary}} system. In the former case, it produces small pinkish nodules {{on the head and}} trunk in juveniles, which appear for a few weeks and then regress, suggesting an intermittently reactivated localized infection that mostly remains dormant. In the second case, <b>it</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> in small white pulmonary nodules on necropsy of many asymptomatic adults. These are both characteristic of EEHV2, EEHV3 and EEHV6.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> {{that the}} western cicada killer wasp is capable of {{thermoregulation}} which enables them to maintain territories during the day. A study by Joseph R. Coelho showed that during territorial patrolling the species had a high and regulated thorax temperature. Experiments found that the wasp {{has the ability to}} shift heat from its thorax to its abdomen and that the abdomen is generally kept colder than the thorax. Dead wasps that were placed in the sun reached abnormally high temperatures when compared to those on nearby plants.|$|E
5|$|<b>It</b> <b>has</b> <b>been</b> <b>found</b> that urban {{populations of}} common toad occupying small areas and {{isolated}} by development show {{a lower level}} of genetic diversity and reduced fitness as compared to nearby rural populations. The researchers demonstrated this by genetic analysis and by noting the greater number of physical abnormalities among urban as against rural tadpoles when raised in a controlled environment. It was considered that long term depletion in numbers and habitat fragmentation can reduce population persistence in such urban environments.|$|E
