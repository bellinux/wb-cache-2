40|$|The {{velocity}} of cytoplasm streaming <b>in</b> <b>an</b> antheridial basal <b>cell</b> and <b>in</b> <b>a</b> subbasal <b>cell</b> {{as well as}} in internodal cells of pleuridia carrying antheridia were measured with the use of videomicroscopy. Velocity of streaming proved different depending on <b>a</b> <b>cell</b> type. The most intensive streaming (ca 40 µm/s) was observed <b>in</b> <b>a</b> subbasal <b>cell</b> while <b>in</b> <b>a</b> basal <b>cell</b> it was quite intensive during antheridial filament cells proliferation but falling to half of it during spermatozoid differentiation (ca 20 µm/s and 10 µm/s respectively). In internodal cells of pleuridia the velocity was ca 17 µm/s. GA 3 at the 10 - 5 M concentration decreased the {{velocity of}} streaming <b>in</b> <b>a</b> basal <b>cell</b> during proliferation of antheridial filament cells and increased it during spermiogenesis. In internodal cells of pleuridia the velocity diminished while <b>in</b> <b>a</b> subbasal <b>cell</b> it rose <b>a</b> little after GA 3 administering. The obtained data suggest that cytoplasm streaming and its reaction to exogenous gibberellin depend on the role of <b>a</b> <b>cell</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> multicellulate system; it also depends on a developmental stage...|$|R
5|$|The final {{match of}} the event was a Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> bout between Batista and Triple H for the World Heavyweight Championship. During the match, Triple H choked Batista with a chain and {{hit him in the}} back with a steel chair wrapped with barbed wire. Batista regained the {{momentum}} by grabbing Triple H's sledgehammer and hitting him with it. Batista performed a spinebuster onto the steel steps on Triple H, which was followed with a Batista Bomb for the win to retain the title. After the Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> match, Triple H was given a standing ovation by the audience.|$|E
5|$|Ziggler then {{entered an}} {{on-screen}} relationship with WWE Diva Maria {{and she became}} his valet. He simultaneously started a scripted rivalry with Intercontinental Champion Rey Mysterio, who defeated Ziggler at the Night of Champions and SummerSlam pay-per-views to retain the championship. In September, Mysterio lost the Intercontinental Championship to John Morrison, and Ziggler entered a feud with Morrison, losing {{to him at the}} Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> pay-per-view. On the episode of SmackDown, following Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell,</b> Ziggler ended his on-screen relationship with Maria after she cost him a match against Morrison.|$|E
5|$|At Breaking Point, Punk {{defeated}} The Undertaker in a submission {{match to}} retain the World Heavyweight Championship. Undertaker originally won the match with his Hell's Gate submission hold. SmackDown general manager Theodore Long restarted the match after stating that the ban that former general manager Vickie Guerrero had placed on the move was still in effect. Punk won the match with his Anaconda Vise when referee Scott Armstrong called for the bell despite Undertaker never submitting (reminiscent to the Montreal Screwjob, {{which took place in}} the same venue in 1997). The feud between the two continued and at the Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> PPV, Punk lost the World Heavyweight Championship to The Undertaker in a Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> match. He lost two subsequent rematches against The Undertaker on SmackDown and in a Fatal Four Way match at Bragging Rights also involving Batista and Rey Mysterio.|$|E

5|$|Lesnar's {{rapid rise}} to the top of WWE in 2002 led to a feud with The Undertaker, which {{involved}} a match at Unforgiven on September 22. The match ended in a double disqualification and Lesnar retained the title. Lesnar faced The Undertaker again at No Mercy, this time in a Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> match. Leading up to the match, in the storyline, Lesnar broke The Undertaker's hand with a propane tank. Despite Heyman begging McMahon not to let The Undertaker use his cast as a weapon, the request was denied and the match went on as planned. At No Mercy on October 20, Lesnar defeated The Undertaker to retain the title. After his Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> match with The Undertaker, Lesnar successfully retained the WWE Championship in a handicap match with Heyman against Edge at Rebellion on October 26.|$|E

5|$|On August 17, 2017, it was {{reported}} that Benjamin had officially re-signed with WWE. On the August 22 episode of SmackDown, Benjamin returned to WWE as Chad Gable's new tag team partner. The following week on SmackDown, Benjamin and Gable defeated The Ascension (Konnor and Viktor) in their first match as a team. They went on to defeat The Hype Bros in their second match as a team on the September 12th episode of SmackDown and again in October 8th at Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell.</b> On the SmackDown after Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell,</b> Benjamin and Gable defeated The Hype Bros, Breezango and The Ascension to become number one contenders to the SmackDown Tag Team Championship. On November 7, Benjamin and Gable faced The Usos for the titles where they won via count out but did not win the titles.|$|E
5|$|On July 23 at Raw 1000, Punk {{defended his}} title against Money in the Bank winner John Cena and lost by {{disqualification}} after interference from Big Show. When the night's special guest The Rock– who had interrupted Punk earlier to announce he would wrestle for the WWE Championship at the Royal Rumble– intervened to save Cena from Big Show's assault, Punk attacked him, turning heel. The following week, Punk justified his actions, explaining {{he was tired}} of people like Cena and Rock overshadowing him when the WWE Champion should be the focus of the company; Punk asserted himself further soon after by disrupting a number one contender's match between Cena and Big Show. As a result, both men were entered into the title match against Punk at SummerSlam where he successfully retained the WWE Championship. In the following weeks, Punk demanded respect from people like AJ Lee, Jerry Lawler and Bret Hart and eventually aligned with Paul Heyman in his feud with Cena. At Night of Champions, Punk retained the WWE Championship after he fought Cena to a draw. Punk continued to feud with Cena, despite the latter's arm injury, rejecting the requests of Mick Foley and Jim Ross to pick him as his Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> opponent and leading to a brawl with WWE chairman Vince McMahon. Cena was eventually pulled from the title match at Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell,</b> and replaced by Ryback. On October 28 at the pay-per-view, Punk, with help from referee Brad Maddox, defeated Ryback in a Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> match to retain the WWE Championship.|$|E
5|$|On the June 16 {{episode of}} Raw, Cena {{defeated}} Kane in a stretcher match {{to qualify for}} the ladder match for the vacant WWE World Heavyweight Championship at Money in the Bank, where Cena won his 15th world championship. Cena then retained the title at Battleground in a fatal four-way match against Roman Reigns, Randy Orton and Kane. At SummerSlam, Cena lost the championship to Brock Lesnar in a squash match, during which Lesnar hit Cena with sixteen suplexes and two F-5s, ending his reign at 49 days. Cena invoked his title rematch clause against Lesnar for Night of Champions, nearly winning before Seth Rollins attacked him to cause a disqualification, although he became the first wrestler to defeat Lesnar in two WWE pay-per-view events. Cena then began feuding with Dean Ambrose for the right to face Rollins at Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell,</b> but Ambrose won the right by defeating Cena in a No Holds Barred Contract on a Pole match. Cena would instead face Randy Orton in a Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> match to determine the #1 contender for the WWE World Heavyweight Championship, which Cena won.|$|E

40|$|It is {{well known}} that {{standard}} cells have been widely used to implement VLSI circuits in the automation of physical design. Since one major aim of a cell-based design is to minimize total layout area <b>in</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>cell</b> placement, the number of feedthrough cells will be minimized to reduce total <b>cell</b> area <b>in</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>cell</b> placement. <b>In</b> this paper, first, we model a partitioning-based row assignment (PRA) problem to minimize the number of feedthrough <b>cells</b> <b>in</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>cell</b> placement. Furthermore, <b>an</b> integer linear programming (ILP) approach is proposed to solve the PRA problem <b>in</b> <b>a</b> standard <b>cell</b> placement. Finally, the ILP approach has been implemented and two standard-cell netlists, Primary 1 and Primary 2, have been tested by the proposed approach, Bose's approach [4] and an exhaustive search approach, respectively. The experimental results show that the ILP approach obtains fewer feedthrough cells than Bose's approach <b>in</b> <b>a</b> partitioning-based standard <b>cell</b> placement...|$|R
5|$|Punk {{then turned}} his sights to Heyman's other client, Intercontinental Champion Curtis Axel. On September 15, Punk faced Axel and Heyman in a No Disqualication, Handicap {{elimination}} match at Night of Champions, {{in which he}} made Axel submit, leaving only Heyman left. In the process of attacking Heyman, Ryback attacked Punk and placed Heyman on top of Punk for the pinfall. A month later, at Battleground, Punk defeated Ryback after executing a low blow, while the referee was distracted by Heyman attempting to interfere in the match. On October 14, Punk defeated Axel in a Beat the Clock challenge match to determine the stipulation for his rematch with Ryback at the Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> pay-per-view, which Punk chose to be a two-on-one Handicap match in the Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> also involving Heyman. At the event on October 27, Punk defeated Heyman and Ryback.|$|E
5|$|The feud between Batista and The Undertaker also continued, {{with both}} agreeing {{to compete in}} a Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell</b> match at Survivor Series on the November 2 episode of SmackDown!.

5|$|After a hiatus, Fox {{returned}} to WWE television, on the September 29 episode of Raw, where she defeated AJ Lee, {{with the help}} of her former rival Paige and subsequently, formed an alliance with her, and went on to pick up another win over AJ on October 20. However, when Fox inadvertently cost Paige a title match at Hell <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>Cell,</b> Paige dissolved the alliance by attacking her the following night on Raw. This prompted a traditional four-on-four elimination tag team match, with each captaining a side, at the Survivor Series pay-per-view in November, where Fox's team won the match with a clean sweep. In January 2015, Fox developed a rivalry with Naomi, during which she formed a brief alliance with The Miz and Damien Mizdow, and the trio went on to defeat Naomi and The Usos in a series of mixed tag team matches. On the April 13 episode of Raw, Fox competed in a number one contender's battle royal for Nikki Bella's WWE Divas Championship, which would be won by Paige.|$|E
