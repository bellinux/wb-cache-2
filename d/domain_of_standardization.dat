In addition, we define a generic, automated process that allows us to extract constructional schemas and present these visually as categorization networks, similar to what is often being used in Cognitive Grammar. We conclude that computational modeling of constructions can contribute to new descriptive linguistic insights, and to practical language solutions. ...|$|R

40|$|System-related {{engineering}} {{tasks are}} often conducted using process models. In this context, {{it is essential}} that these models do not contain structural or terminological inconsistencies. To this end, several automatic analysis techniques have been proposed to support quality assurance. While formal properties of control flow can be checked in an automated fashion, {{there is a lack of}} techniques addressing textual quality. More specifically, there is currently no technique available for handling the issue of lexical ambiguity caused by homonyms and synonyms. In this paper, we address this research gap and propose a technique that detects and resolves lexical ambiguities in process models. We evaluate the technique using three process model collections from practice varying in size, <b>domain,</b> and degree <b>of</b> <b>standardization.</b> The evaluation demonstrates that the technique significantly reduces the level of lexical ambiguity and that meaningful candidates are proposed for resolving ambiguity...|$|R

40|$|While {{research}} on the cost effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> to date {{has focused on the}} impact of different degrees <b>of</b> <b>standardization,</b> it has paid insufficient attention to the process an organization uses to formulate and implement standardized procedures. Drawing on the organizational decision-making literature and procedural fairness literature, this study identifies a number of key process features in standardization and argues that variations in these process features across organizations help account for the varying success <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> in achieving cost effectiveness. Using hospital drug standardization for coronary artery and pneumonia cases to ground much of the argument, I analyzed inpatient discharge data from Florida, Illinois, New York, and Texas, combined with an original survey of 243 hospital pharmacy directors. The results indicated that an increasing degree <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> was associated with cost effectiveness when the level of formal objectivity in creating the standardized procedure was high and when there was due process in resolving disputes about the standardized procedure. This finding broadly supports the argument that the cost effectiveness <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> depends not just on the degree <b>of</b> <b>standardization</b> but also on the process by which the standardized procedures are created and implemented. healthcare, hospitals, organizational studies, design, effectiveness performance...|$|R

40|$|While the {{traditional}} {{literature and the}} policy statements concerning standardization as such emphasize the benefits <b>of</b> <b>standardization,</b> the intellectual property and competition law literature and policymaking has been more critical <b>of</b> <b>standardization.</b> Intellectual property is relevant, as the technology embedded in a standard is often protected with so-called Standard Essential Patents (SEPs). Similarly, competition law is relevant to the collective behaviour of private firms in creating and operating Standard-Setting Organisations (SSOs), and to their individual behaviour in notifying and licensing their intellectual property. In recent litigation, three issues have risen to the fore, popularized under the labels “patent ambush”, “patent holdup” and “patent thickets”.
