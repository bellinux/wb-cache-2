5|$|The vast {{majority}} of known Tarbosaurus fossils were recovered from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia.

5|$|Two {{species of}} Pteranodon are {{traditionally}} recognized as valid: Pteranodon longiceps, the type species, and Pteranodon sternbergi. The species differ {{only in the}} shape of the crest in adult males (described above), and possibly in the angle of certain skull bones. Because well-preserved Pteranodon skull fossils are extremely rare, researchers use stratigraphy (i.e. which rock layer of the <b>geologic</b> <b>formation</b> a fossil is found in) to determine species identity in most cases.|$|E

5|$|The {{process of}} {{selecting}} appropriate permanent repositories for high level waste and spent fuel {{is now under}} way in several countries with the first expected to be commissioned some time after 2017. The basic concept is to locate a large, stable <b>geologic</b> <b>formation</b> and use mining technology to excavate a tunnel, or large-bore tunnel boring machines (similar to those used to drill the Chunnel from England to France) to drill a shaft 500–1,000 meters below the surface where rooms or vaults can be excavated for disposal of high-level radioactive waste. The goal is to permanently isolate nuclear waste from the human environment. However, many people remain uncomfortable with the immediate stewardship cessation of this disposal system, suggesting perpetual management and monitoring would be more prudent.|$|E
5|$|The three known Deinocheirus {{specimens}} {{were recovered}} from the Nemegt Formation in the Gobi Desert of southern Mongolia. This <b>geologic</b> <b>formation</b> has never been dated radiometrically, but the fauna present in the fossil record indicate it was probably deposited during the early Maastrichtian stage, {{at the end of}} the Late Cretaceous about 70 million years ago. The rock facies of the Nemegt Formation suggest the presence of stream and river channels, mudflats, and shallow lakes. Such large river channels and soil deposits are evidence of a far more humid climate than those found in the older Barun Goyot and Djadochta formations. However, caliche deposits indicate at least periodic droughts occurred. Sediment was deposited in the channels and floodplains of large rivers.|$|E
5|$|Thus, {{engineer}} and physicist Hannes Alfvén identified two fundamental prerequisites for effective management of high-level radioactive waste: (1) stable geological formations, and (2) stable human institutions {{over hundreds of}} thousands of years. As Alfvén suggests, no known human civilization has ever endured for so long, and no <b>geologic</b> <b>formation</b> of adequate size for a permanent radioactive waste repository has yet been discovered that has been stable for so long a period. Nevertheless, avoiding confronting the risks associated with managing radioactive wastes may create countervailing risks of greater magnitude. Radioactive waste management is an example of policy analysis that requires special attention to ethical concerns, examined in the light of uncertainty and futurity: consideration of 'the impacts of practices and technologies on future generations'.|$|E

5|$|All {{identifiable}} {{fossils of}} Albertosaurus sarcophagus are {{known from the}} upper Horseshoe Canyon Formation in Alberta. These younger units of this <b>geologic</b> <b>formation</b> date to the early Maastrichtian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, 70 to 68 Ma (million years ago). Immediately below this formation is the Bearpaw Shale, a marine formation representing {{a section of the}} Western Interior Seaway. The seaway was receding as the climate cooled and sea levels subsided {{towards the end of the}} Cretaceous, exposing land that had previously been underwater. It was not a smooth process, however, and the seaway would periodically rise to cover parts of the region throughout Horseshoe Canyon before finally receding altogether in the years after. Due to the changing sea levels, many different environments are represented in the Horseshoe Canyon Formation, including offshore and near-shore marine habitats and coastal habitats like lagoons, estuaries and tidal flats. Numerous coal seams represent ancient peat swamps. Like most of the other vertebrate fossils from the formation, Albertosaurus remains are found in deposits laid down in the deltas and floodplains of large rivers during the later half of Horseshoe Canyon times.|$|E

25|$|In 2-dimensions (2D), a <b>geologic</b> <b>formation</b> or unit is {{represented}} by a polygon, which can be bounded by faults, unconformities or by its lateral extent, or crop. In geological models a geological unit is bounded by 3-dimensional (3D) triangulated or gridded surfaces. The equivalent to the mapped polygon is the fully enclosed geological unit, using a triangulated mesh. For the purpose of property or fluid modelling these volumes can be separated further into an array of cells, {{often referred to as}} voxels (volumetric elements). These 3D grids are the equivalent to 2D grids used to express properties of single surfaces.|$|E
25|$|In 1923, the Third Asiatic Expedition of the American Museum of Natural History, led {{by chief}} {{paleontologist}} Walter W. Granger was hunting for dinosaur fossils in Mongolia. On April 25, assistant paleontologist George Olsen recovered the holotype (AMNH 6554), or name-bearing specimen, of Alectrosaurus, a nearly complete right hindlimb. This included the distal {{end of the}} right femur, the tibia, the fibula, the astragalus, the calcaneum, an incomplete right pes, three metatarsals of the left hind foot, two manual unguals, a manus, and the distal end of the pubis known as the pubic foot. On May 4, Olsen discovered AMNH 6368 approximately 30 meters away from his first find. This specimen included a right humerus, two incomplete manual digits, four fragmentary caudal vertebrae, and other poorly preserved material. These discoveries were made at the Iren Dabasu Formation {{in what is now}} the Inner Mongolia Autonomous Region (Nei Mongol Zizhiqu) of the People's Republic of China. The age of this <b>geologic</b> <b>formation</b> is not clear, but is commonly cited as the Campanian stage of the Late Cretaceous Period, about 83 to 72 million years ago.|$|E

500|$|The first, unofficial, {{mention of}} Amargasaurus {{as a new}} genus of dinosaur was {{published}} by Bonaparte in the 1984 Italian book Sulle Orme dei Dinosauri. Here, the species was designated as Amargasaurus groeberi, honoring Pablo Groeber, which was changed into Amargasaurus cazaui in the official description published several years later. The official description, written in Spanish, was published in 1991 by Leonardo Salgado and Bonaparte in the Argentinian scientific journal Ameghiniana. The name Amargasaurus alludes {{to the site of}} discovery, the La Amarga Arroyo. La Amarga is also the name of a nearby town, as well as the <b>geologic</b> <b>formation</b> the remains were recovered from. The word amarga is Spanish for [...] "bitter", while sauros is Greek for [...] "lizard". The one species (A. cazaui) is named in honor of Luis Cazau, a geologist with the YPF oil company, which at the time was state-owned. In 1983, Cazau informed Bonaparte's team about the paleontological significance of the La Amarga Formation, leading to the discovery of the skeleton. One year later, Salgado and Jorge O. Calvo published a second paper focusing on the description of the skull.|$|E
500|$|The Yellowstone Caldera is {{the largest}} {{volcanic}} system in North America.

The magma chamber that lies under Yellowstone {{is estimated to be}} a single connected chamber, about [...] long, [...] wide, and 3 to 7 miles (5 to 12km) deep. [...] The current caldera was created by a cataclysmic eruption that occurred 640,000years ago, which released more than 240cubic miles (1,000km³) of ash, rock and pyroclastic materials. This eruption was more than 1,000 times larger than the 1980 eruption of Mount St. Helens. It produced a caldera nearly five eighths of a mile (1km) deep and [...] in area and deposited the Lava Creek Tuff, a welded tuff <b>geologic</b> <b>formation.</b> The most violent known eruption, which occurred 2.1million years ago, ejected 588cubic miles (2,450km³) of volcanic material and created the rock formation known as the Huckleberry Ridge Tuff and created the Island Park Caldera.
