5|$|Whale {{was born}} in Dudley, England, the sixth of seven {{children}} of William, a blast <b>furnaceman,</b> and Sarah, a nurse. He attended Kates Hill Board School, followed by Bayliss Charity School and finally Dudley Blue Coat School. His attendance stopped in his teenage years because the cost would have been prohibitive and his labor was needed to help support the family. Thought not physically strong enough to follow his brothers into the local heavy industries, Whale started work as a cobbler, reclaiming the nails he recovered from replaced soles and selling them for scrap for extra money. He discovered he had some artistic ability and earned additional money lettering signs and price tags for his neighbors. He used his additional income to pay for evening classes at the Dudley School of Arts and Crafts.|$|E

40|$|A {{national}} survey of the incidence of nasal cancer in England and Wales during the period 1963 - 7 with special reference to occupation confirmed the well-known increases in incidence of nasal cancer in cabinet makers and wood machinists, together with {{the absence of any}} significant increase in carpenters and joiners, and the increases in boot and shoe operatives and repairers, and in nickel smelters in South Wales. The significant excesses of cases found among coalminers, <b>furnacemen</b> in the gas, coke, and chemical industry, and <b>furnacemen</b> and labourers in foundries may be associated with exposure to coal and coke dust or may be spurious. No excess of nasal cancer was found among male textile workers. Excesses of uncertain significance were found among tailors and dressmakers, bakers and pastry cooks, and printers. Apart from the well-known relationships between adenocarcinoma and work in the furniture and footwear industries there is no definite indication in this survey of any association between a particular histological type of nasal tumour and occupation in England and Wales...|$|R

5000|$|Sparrow {{was born}} in 1862, younger son of James Sparrow JP FGS (1824-1902) and his wife Caroline (1828-1904), of Gwersyllt Hill, near Wrexham, Wales. In 1855, James Sparrow had become {{proprietor}} of Ffrwd Works, a large colliery, ironworks and brickworks between Brymbo and Cefn-y-bedd which he expanded {{into one of the}} most prominent businesses in North Wales. During his boyhood Sparrow got to know many of his father's colliers, <b>furnacemen,</b> blacksmiths, carpenters and farm workers, and gained a respect and admiration for the men he described as [...] "so big, strong, simple-hearted, and kind". He made a study of the cruel conditions endured by coal miners and the fact that nationally over a thousand colliers were killed every year in accidents, and this engendered in him a desire to see fairness for working men.|$|R
40|$|The {{association}} between nasal cancer and various occupations {{was investigated in}} a case-control study in the provinces of Verona and Vicenza (northeastern Italy) and Siena (central Italy). Cases of malignant epithelial neoplasm of the nasal cavities and paranasal sinuses diagnosed in the years 1982 - 1987 in the hospitals of Verona, Legnago, Bussolengo, Vicenza, and Siena comprised the study. Controls were patients admitted to the same hospitals as the cases, with any diagnosis except chronic rhino-sinusal disease and nasal bleeding. Age, gender, residency, and date of admission were taken into account by matching. Cases and controls, or their next of kin, were interviewed or required to fill in a mailed questionnaire; the overall response rate was 70 %. Altogether, 78 cases and 254 controls provided information on occupational history. Significantly increased risks were associated (in males) with work in the wood industry (odds ratio [O. R. ]: 5. 8; 90 % confidence interval [C. I. ]: (2. 2 - 16) and in the leather industry (6. 8; 1. 9 - 25). Textile workers, <b>furnacemen,</b> construction workers, and workers with possible exposure to organic dusts showed increased risks even if statistical significance was not reached...|$|R

50|$|Born in Sheffield, Latham {{played as}} a youth for local side Brightside and Carbrook Co-Op before being spotted by Sheffield United. The Blades signed Latham as an amateur in October 1937 and he played {{regularly}} in the reserves until turning professional a year later. The Onset of World War II interrupted Latham's development but as {{he worked as a}} <b>furnaceman</b> in Sheffield's steel works, a reserved occupation, he was able to continue to play for United and was a regular starter at left-back during the war years. Latham also made one appearance as a guest player for Chesterfield in 1941 when they found themselves short of players for a fixture.|$|E
40|$|OBJECTIVES: To {{estimate}} the annual rates of self reported occupational asthma in different occupational groups in Sweden. METHODS: All claims of occupational asthma 1990 - 2 in the Swedish register of reported occupational diseases were classified according to occupation. The {{number of people}} employed in each occupational group {{in the general population}} was obtained from the 1990 national census. Reporting rates (cases/million/ year) were calculated for each occupation with more than five reported cases, according to sex and age (20 to 64 years, and 20 to 44 years). RESULTS: 1010 cases were reported giving an annual crude reporting rate of 80 /million (95 % confidence interval (95 % CI) 70 to 90). For men, the crude reporting rate was 91 /million (95 % CI 84 to 98), and for women 70 /million (95 % CI 80 to 106). The highest reporting rates were among male bakers-(775 /million), <b>furnacemen</b> (702 /million), male welders (647 /million), female chemical and plastic production workers (629 /million), and female poultry and dairy farm workers (602 /million). CONCLUSIONS: A surveillance system based on self reporting is influenced by considerable bias, especially reporting bias. However, results for the specific occupations with high rates were similar to those found with other surveillance systems. This indicates that our system is a useful one...|$|R
6000|$|It {{was strange}} enough, {{in the silence}} of midnight, and the dead stillness that seemed to be created by the sudden and {{unexpected}} stoppage of the engine which had been clanking and blasting in our ears incessantly for so many days, to watch the look of blank astonishment expressed in every face: beginning with the officers, tracing it through all the passengers, and descending to the very stokers and <b>furnacemen,</b> who emerged from below, one by one, and clustered together in a smoky group about the hatchway of the engine-room, comparing notes in whispers. After throwing up a few rockets and firing signal guns in the hope of being hailed from the land, or at least of seeing a light - but without any other sight or sound presenting itself - it was determined to send a boat on shore. It was amusing to observe how very kind some of the passengers were, in volunteering to go ashore in this same boat: [...] for the general good, of course: not by any means because they thought the ship in an unsafe position, or contemplated the possibility of her heeling over in case the tide were running out. [...] Nor was it less amusing to remark how desperately unpopular the poor pilot became in one short minute. He had had his passage out from Liverpool, and during the whole voyage had been quite a notorious character, as a teller of anecdotes and cracker of jokes. [...] Yet here were the very men who had laughed the loudest at his jests, now flourishing their fists in his face, loading him with imprecations, and defying him to his teeth as a villain! ...|$|R

5000|$|Cleland {{was charged}} with {{culpable}} homicide and tried at the High Court in Glasgow on 24 April. At the trial Patterson {{said that when he}} touched the indicator it was [...] "very loose. He had never noticed it so loose before". Two engineers called for the defence at the trial also criticised the method of attaching the indicator as [...] "not proper" [...] and [...] "not ... to be the best mode known to engineers". Michael Flanagan, a <b>furnaceman</b> at the pithead, reported that Cleland said [...] "the indicator was wrong" [...] and Flanagan observed that the indicator was further down than it should have been. The manager, Watson, admitted under cross-examination that it was the duty of the oversman to examine the indicator but he did not do so. Most witnesses also gave Cleland a good character reference. After a short retirement, the jury returned a verdict of not proven.|$|E
5000|$|Among {{the most}} {{significant}} achievements of Leningrad artists in this period, critics name the paintings <b>Furnaceman</b> (1955) by Mikhail Trufanov, The Lena. 1912 (1957) by Yuri Tulin, Campfires (1957) by Vasily Sokolov, University Embankment (1957) by Gleb Savinov, The First Cavalry Army (1957) by Evsey Moiseenko, A Warm Day (1957) by Anatoli Levitin, Portrait of the Collective Farm Chairman M. Dolgov (1959) by Nina Veselova, Morning (1960) by Vecheslav Zagonek, The Opening Up of the North (1960) by Boris Korneev, They Were Beginning the Bratsk Hydroelectric Power Station (1960) by Yuri Podlasky, In the Leningrad Philharmonia. 1942 (1959) Portrait of F. Bezuglov, Smelter of the Krasny Vyborzhets Works (1960) by Joseph Serebriany, and Holiday in Voronovo (1960) by Nina Veselova and Leonid Kabachek. They giftedly embody the image of contemporaries {{in the era of}} Khrushchev’s [...] "thaw" [...] with its conceptions about the revolution, the past and present, with the tremendous scale of construction projects and the achievements of Soviet science and technology.In this period a number of landscape painters positively attracted the public’s attention, including Vladimir Ovchinnikov, Nikolai Timkov, Sergei Osipov, George Tatarnikov, Dmitry Maevsky, Vecheslav Zagonek, Nikolai Galakhov, Alexander Guliaev and Vsevolod Bazhenov. In their work panoramic landscapes traditional for Russian painting became popular. And although in the first post-war decade many artists continued to evolve in a direction marked out in their student days, their efforts to vary the painterly-plastic devices used to produce an image became ever more obvious. The circle of traditions that Leningrad artists were drawing upon grew wider. Edging out the historical painting, there was a rapid upsurge in this period in portraiture, the still life and genre pieces, while the study was reinstated in its rights. As a result, such talented painters as Evgenia Antipova, Vladimir Tokarev, Lev Russov, Oleg Lomakin, Mikhail Trufanov, Boris Korneev, Arseny Semionov, Victor Teterin, Elena Skuin, Gevork Kotiantz, and Maya Kopitseva were able to realize themselves in those genres. Their work became a noticeable phenomenon in painting in the 1960s-80s, substantially enriching it in terms of genre and style.|$|E
40|$|Solitary primary amyloid nodule of {{the lung}} is rare. Only eight {{cases have been}} reported. Our patient was a 66 -year-old retired <b>furnaceman</b> Who had an asymptomatic, smooth, round shadow in the right lower lobe, {{discovered}} accidentally on routine chest radiography. Right lower lobectomy was performed and a firm round nodule {{was found in the}} lateral basal segment. Its cut surface had a yellow-grey tinge and stained mahogany brown with Lugol's iodine. Micro-soopically the nodule consisted of uniformly eosinophilic-staining material with scattered multi-nucleate giant cells and groups of lymphocytes, plasma cells, and mononuclear cells at the edge. As the material stained with Congo red and gave typical greenish 'birefringence under polarized light it was evidently amyloid. Primary amyloid lesions may occur in the lung parenchyma or in the br,onchi. The rarest form of amyloid disease of the lung is primary isolated nodular amyloidosis of the parenchyma. The first case was reported by Lesser in 1877 and from then up to 1966 only seven solitary amyloi...|$|E
