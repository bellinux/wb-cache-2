30|$|<b>Tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> The {{purpose of}} the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism</b> is to {{increase}} the number of DOFs of the calibration board. It allows calibration trajectories to be in three-dimensional space. Figure  2 c, d shows the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> To increase the number of DOFs while retaining sufficient stiffness of the calibration table, a 3 -DOF ball joint with high stiffness was used in the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism.</b> The calibration board can tilt in roll and pitch directions. A wing nut on the ball joint slider is used to fix the ball joint slider and aluminum extrusion (see Fig.  2 c, d). Therefore, the calibration broad rotates in roll and pitch direction via the <b>tilting</b> <b>mechanism.</b>|$|R

40|$|Care-needing {{older adults}} and {{disabled}} individuals often require handrails for assistance of movements, such as sit-to-stand movements. Handrails must be {{set at the}} appropriate position; however, the effects of handrail height on joint movement and center-of-gravity movements during sit-to-stand movement remain unclear. In the present study, we sought to clarify the effects of handrail height on joint movement, center-of-gravity, and floor reaction force during sit-to-stand movement. Subjects included 16 healthy young adults and 25 older adults who require long-term care. Kinetic and kinematic measurements during sit-to-stand movement of young adults were conducted using a 3 -D motion analyzer and a force plate. Trunk <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> angle during sit-to-stand movement of older adults was measured using a still image from a video recording. Using low handrails, sit-to-stand movement resulted in an increased hip flexion angle, ankle dorsiflexion angle, and trunk <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> angle and a greater forward center-of-gravity shift than when not using handrails in young adults during seat-off. In contrast, using high handrails resulted in a smaller hip flexion angle and trunk <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> angle in young adults. The backward force on the floor was decreased in the low handrail condition, and was increased in the high handrail condition rather than that of sit-to-stand movement without handrails in young adults. The effect of handrail height on trunk <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> angle was the same in both healthy young adults and care-needing older adults during seat-off. Because handrail height affects joint movement and shift in the center-of-gravity during sit-to-stand movement, handrail position should be selected to match the status of older adults with functional impairment...|$|R

40|$|A mesoscale-model {{simulation}} is used {{to examine}} the evolution of the cold front and accompanying cloud bands in eastern Mexico associated with Superstorm 1993 (12 – 14 March). The simulated cold front differed in structure and evolution from a classical cold front, in agreement with evidence from observations and European Centre for Medium-Range Weather Forecasts analyses. The surface cold front, as defined by the leading edge of strong northerlies and cold advection, initially possessed a rearward tilt with height over southern Texas. Within 6 h, {{the leading edge of the}} front moved equatorward and developed a large-scale <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> of greater than 200 km in the horizontal from the surface to 700 hPa. This <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> occurred as a mid- to upper-tropospheric baroclinic zone arrived from over the Sierra Madre, descended into eastern Mexico, and interacted with the surface cold front. Embedded within this large-scale <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> was a locally enhanced horizontal potential temperature gradient that also tilted forward; 100 km from the surface to 850 hPa. Tilting frontogenesis associated with ascent at the leading edge of the surface front was responsible for the smaller-scale forward-tilting structure. This surface-based ascent is believed to have caused the primary cloud band observed from satellite imagery that is coincident with the leading edge of the front, whereas a second region of ascent, elevated at the leading edge of the mid- to upper-tropospheric baroclinic zone, is believed to have caused the prefronta...|$|R

30|$|With {{such high}} loads, {{the method of}} load {{carriage}} is of major importance. For infantry, the most efficient place to carry load is on the torso {{with the use of}} a pack system [16]. In an effort to balance the moment caused by the loaded pack, soldiers will increase the <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> of their trunk, placing increased load on the lumbar spine [16]. Load carriage vests may be employed to lower the energetic cost, improve posture and hence lower the risk of injury by redistributing weight forwards and reducing the <b>forward</b> <b>tilt</b> [16]. Other factors related to the use of packs are the rigidity of the pack frame [36], location of load in the pack [16], terrain [16] and gender effects [16]. In questionnaires, women have been found to comment more than men about uncomfortable pack straps, poorly fitted pistol belts and unstable rucksacks, suggesting that current pack systems do not adequately cater for the differing anthropometry between the two genders [16].|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Postural {{control is}} {{important}} for daily activities like reaching and sitting. Children with cerebral palsy (CP) form {{the largest group of}} children with disturbances in postural control. Two levels can be distinguished in postural control: 1) a basic level of direction-specificity, meaning that perturbations inducing a forward sway of the body are accompanied by primary muscle activity on the dorsal side of the body and vice versa and 2) fine-tuning of the direction-specific activity on the basis of afferent input. This pilot study explores the influence of different sitting positions on the stability of the head in space, the kinematic quality of reaching and EMG-parameters of postural control in school-aged children with CP. Methods: Four children aged 8 - 12 years, GMFCS level I-II with unilateral or bilateral spastic CP participated in the study. They were assessed during reaching in four different sitting positions: horizontal seat surface with and without foot support and <b>tilted</b> <b>forward</b> 15 ° with and without foot support. Postural control was measured using surface EMGs of arm, neck, trunk and leg muscles. Movements were recorded kinematically using the SIMI Motion System. Data analysis was carried out with the PedEMG program and the SIMI Motion 3 D program. Data were interpreted by ‘eye balling’ graphs of the effect of sitting condition of the individual children. Results: Overall, posture and reaching of the children with CP was characterized by variation. The data suggested that in the conditions without foot support a <b>forward</b> <b>tilted</b> seat surface in comparison to the horizontal situation was associated with a better quality of reaching and an inconsistent effect on head stability and postural muscle activity. In the horizontal position addition of foot support seemed to be associated with an inconsistent effect on head stability, but a better quality of reaching, and better postural muscle activity. However, foot support in the <b>forward</b> <b>tilted</b> condition seemed not to be associated with improved head stability, reaching and posture. Conclusion: The results of this exploratory study indicate that in the situation of the absence of foot support <b>forward</b> <b>tilting</b> of the seat surface may be associated with a better quality of reaching without affecting postural control. Also the addition of foot support in the horizontal position may {{have a positive effect on}} the quality of reaching without a consistent positive effect on posture. A similar positive effect of foot support seemed absent in the <b>forward</b> <b>tilted</b> position. Further research with larger groups is needed for scientific evidence on the effect of the various sitting conditions on reaching and posture of children with CP. ...|$|R
