5|$|TO BOIL A <b>JOHN</b> <b>DORY.</b>|$|E
5|$|Bouillabaisse is a {{substantial}} dish from the French port of Marseille, capital of Provence. It is a stew for at least eight people, because it should contain many kinds of fish such as crayfish, gurnard, weever, <b>John</b> <b>Dory,</b> monkfish, conger eel, whiting, sea bass, and crab. These are cooked with Mediterranean vegetables and herbs, namely onions, garlic, tomatoes, thyme, fennel, parsley, bay, and orange peel.|$|E
5|$|The <b>John</b> <b>Dory,</b> {{though of}} uninviting appearance, is {{considered}} by some persons as the most delicious fish that appears at table; in the general estimation, however, it ranks next to the turbot, but it is far less abundant in our waters, and is not commonly to be procured of sufficient size for a handsome dish, except in some few parts of our coast which are celebrated for it. It may easily be known by its yellow gray colour, its one large dark spot on either side, the long filaments on the back, a general thickness of form, and its very ugly head. It is dressed in the same manner, and served usually with the same sauces as a turbot, but requires less time to boil it. The fins should be cut off before it is cooked.|$|E
50|$|The {{company also}} owns the Panarotti’s pizza and pasta {{restaurant}} chain. This chain {{was started in}} 1990 and has 49 South African and 6 international outlets. In addition, the Spur Group purchased a 60% shareholding in <b>John</b> <b>Dory’s</b> Fish and Grill in 2004. <b>John</b> <b>Dory's</b> is a KwaZulu-Natal-based franchise with 22 outlets.|$|R

25|$|Much {{maritime}} activity {{takes place}} - especially at Kilmore Quay and Slade, {{but also on}} a smaller scale at many other locations. Common fish species include herring, mackerel, cod, monkfish, whiting, bass, perch, gurnard, haddock, mullet, pollock, <b>John</b> <b>Dory,</b> sole, conger eel, shad, salmon, trout, pike, carp, and tench. Shellfish include mussels, cockles, periwinkles, clams, and oysters.|$|E
500|$|Victor Lewis-Smith {{reviewed}} the restaurant for The Guardian in 2005, {{thought that a}} spring onion risotto accompaniment to a pan fried seabass tasted so good {{that it would have}} been sufficient as a main course itself and was also quite pleased that crêpe suzette was served on a trolley for table side service. Claire Ogden visited the restaurant for the Metro newspaper shortly after it was first awarded a Michelin star in 2007. She thought that a <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> main course was [...] "pristine", and overall thought that the star was well deserved. The only negative thing she had to say about the experience was a toffee foam served on top of a pear granita which she described as [...] "flimsy-flavoured". It was named the best restaurant in Britain by Les Routiers later that year. The critic from the Western Mail stated in 2008 that [...] "the menu is short and to the point, with around five choices for each course. The wine list is huge, an insurmountable challenge for me but another's utopia." [...] However, he remarked that the main course was [...] "genuinely brilliant food" [...] and deserving of its Michelin star.|$|E
60|$|There was {{a change}} in <b>John</b> <b>Dory's</b> face. The man's eyes were bright--they almost glittered.|$|R

60|$|He {{was held}} {{as though in}} a vice. <b>John</b> <b>Dory's</b> arm was through his on one side, and Peter Ruff's on the other. Apart from that, the muzzle of a {{revolver}} was pressed to his forehead.|$|R
500|$|Acton's book {{is divided}} into {{chapters}} with brief, often single word titles such as [...] "Fish". In a marked departure from eighteenth century English cookery books like Hannah Glasse's The Art of Cookery, these are written as connected wholes. The chapter on fish begins with an essay on how to choose fish for freshness; there follows some {{advice on how to}} bake fish, and on the kinds of fat best used for frying fish. Suitable pans are illustrated. The recipes follow; these too are written as stories rather than simply as instructions. Where appropriate, recipes end with a list of ingredients, as well as the cooking time, in marked change from eighteenth century practice. Recipes are grouped, in the case of fish by species, and they form a connected story. Acton adds comments where she sees fit, indicating anything from when the food is in season to where a recipe came from, and how much she likes it. For example, she begins her account of the <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> with a recipe which is more of an introductory essay than a set of instructions, though given the simplicity of the recipe, it says all that a cook would need to know on the matter: ...|$|E
2500|$|<b>John</b> <b>dory</b> are fishes of {{the genus}} Zeus. They have a {{widespread}} distribution and are typically found near the seabed in depths from [...] The <b>John</b> <b>dory</b> grows to a maximum length of [...] Although it is a benthopelagic fish, its body is flat and it can hardly {{be seen from the}} front because it is so thin. It is a poor swimmer with long spines on the dorsal fin. It has a large dark eyespot on the side of its body which is used to confuse prey, which are scooped up in its big mouth. Large eyes {{at the front of the}} head provide it with bifocal vision and depth perception, which are important for predators. The <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> usually gets its food by stalking it then shooting out a tube in its mouth to capture its prey. It eats forage fish, and occasionally squid and cuttlefish. In turn, they are preyed on by sharks, like the dusky shark, and other large bony fish. They are normally solitary.|$|E

50|$|Bandfish are an {{important}} part of the diets of many oceanic predators, especially <b>john</b> <b>dories,</b> but also other fish, common dolphins and the musky octopus, Eledone moschata. Bandfish may have taken up an ecological niche burrowing and eating zooplakton due to strong pressures from predators.|$|R
50|$|When <b>John</b> <b>Dories</b> are 3 or 4 {{years of}} age, {{they are ready}} to reproduce. This happens around the end of winter. They are {{substrate}} scatterers, which means that they release sperm and eggs into the water to fertilize. Typical lifespan is about 12 years in the wild.|$|R
60|$|There {{was a brief}} silence. <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> {{knocked the}} ash from his cigar.|$|E
60|$|Mr. <b>John</b> <b>Dory,</b> who {{had arrived}} at Clenarvon Court in a four-wheel cab from the nearest railway station, was ushered by the butler {{to the door of}} one of the rooms on the ground floor, {{overlooking}} the Park. A policeman was there on guard--a policeman by his attitude and salute, although he was in plain clothes. <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> nodded, and turned to the butler.|$|E
60|$|<b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> glanced {{it through}} {{and rose to}} his feet. A gleam of {{satisfaction}} lit his eyes.|$|E
50|$|This {{rendition}} of the material also borrows from Roeg's film -- Dory owns a wall of many television sets, which are simultaneously tuned to different channels. The World Enterprises base is in New Mexico, {{as it is in}} the original film. <b>John</b> <b>Dory's</b> appearance in his natural alien form is identical to that of Thomas Jerome Newton, as portrayed by David Bowie in 1976, when his prosthetics are removed.|$|R

In every other way, heaven knows, you are clever enough! And yet there comes this vulgar, commonplace, tawdry little woman from heaven knows where, and makes such a fool of {{you that you are}} willing to fling away your career--to hold your wrists out for <b>John</b> <b>Dory's</b> handcuffs!" ...|$|R

60|$|Now it is {{possible}} that at this precise moment Marnstam would have made his spring for the window and Rounceby his running fight for liberty. The hands of both men were upon their revolvers, and <b>John</b> <b>Dory's</b> life was a thing of no account. But at this juncture a thing happened. There were in the room the two policemen guarding the swing doors, and behind them the pale faces of a couple of night porters looking anxiously in. Vincent Cawdor and Miss Brown were standing side by side, a little in the background, and the young man who had been their companion had risen also to his feet. As though with some intention of intervening, he moved a step forward, almost in line with Dory. Rounceby saw him, and a new fear gripped him by the heart. He shrank back, his fingers relaxed their hold of his weapon, the sweat was hot upon his forehead. Marnstam, though he seemed for a moment stupefied, realised the miracle which had happened and struck boldly for his own.|$|R
60|$|<b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> {{was nearly}} {{a quarter of an hour}} late. After his third useless summons, Mr. Peter Ruff {{presented}} himself again.|$|E

6000|$|Peter Ruff {{laid the}} paper down upon {{his desk and}} looked {{steadily}} at a box of India-rubber bands. Almost his fingers, as he parted with the newspaper, had seemed to be shaking. His eyes were certainly set in an unusually retrospective stare. Who was this who sought to probe his past, to renew an acquaintance with a dead personality? [...] "M" [...] could be but one person! What did she want of him? Was it possible that, after all, a little flame of sentiment had been kept alight in her bosom, too--that in the quiet moments her thoughts had turned towards him as his had so often done to her? Then a sudden idea--an ugly thought--drove the tenderness from his face. She was no longer Maud Barnes--she was Mrs. <b>John</b> <b>Dory,</b> and <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> was his enemy! Could there be treachery lurking beneath those simple lines? Things had not gone well with <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> lately. Somehow or other, his cases seemed to have crumpled into dust. He was no longer held in the same esteem at headquarters. Yet could even <b>John</b> <b>Dory</b> stoop to such means as these? ...|$|E
60|$|As {{a matter}} of fact, this, in some respects the most {{remarkable}} of the adventures which had ever befallen Mr. Peter Ruff, came to him by accident. Lady Mary had read the announcement of his marriage in the paper, had driven at once to his office with a magnificent present, and insisted upon his coming with his wife to the party which was assembling at Clenarvon Court in honor of her own approaching wedding. Peter Ruff had taken few holidays of late years, and for several days had thoroughly enjoyed himself. The matter of the Clenarvon jewels he considered, perhaps, with a slight professional interest; but so {{far as he could}} see, the precautions for guarding them were so adequate that the subject did not remain in his memory. He had, however, a very distinct and disagreeable shock when, on the night of <b>John</b> <b>Dory's</b> appearance, he recognized among a few newly-arrived guests the Marquis de Sogrange. He took the opportunity, as soon as possible, of withdrawing his wife from a little circle among whom they had been talking, to a more retired corner of the room. She saw at once that something had happened to disturb him.|$|R
60|$|Michael was spoken to, and he clambered {{up out of}} the boat, as well as he could; {{the task}} not being very easy, since the {{fishermen}} with difficulty kept their dull, heavy boat out of our mizen chains. In the mean time, Marble and I found time to compare notes. We agreed that Mr. Terence McScale, or O' something,--for I forget the fellow's surname,--would probably turn out a more useful man in hauling in mackerel and <b>John</b> <b>Dorys,</b> than in helping us {{to take care of the}} Dawn. Nor did Michael, at the first glance promise anything much better. He was very old,--eighty. I should think,--and appeared to have nullified all the brains he ever had, by the constant use of whiskey; the scent of which accompanied him with a sort of parasitical odour, as that of tannin attends the leather-dresser. He was not drunk just then, however, but seemed cool and collected. I explained my wishes to this man; and was glad to find he had a tolerable notion of nautical terms, and that he would not be likely to get us into difficulty, like Terence, through any ignorance on this score.|$|R
5000|$|In Nova Scotia, {{the towns}} of Lunenburg and Shelburne {{maintained}} a rivalry in mass production of dories. A distinction emerged in 1887 with the use in Shelburne of [...] "dory clips", metal braces used to join frames, versus the more expensive but stronger natural wood frames used in Lunenburg <b>dories.</b> The <b>John</b> Williams <b>Dory</b> Shop in Shelburne {{was one of several}} Shelburne factories mass-producing dories. It is now the Dory Shop Museum, operated by the Nova Scotia Museum and continues to produce banks dories for local and visiting customers.|$|R
