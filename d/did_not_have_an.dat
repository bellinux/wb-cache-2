By 2009, however, Burundi had a FIFA-recognised senior national team nicknamed the Swallows and a FIFA-recognised Burundi women's under-20 national team.

5|$|The {{presence}} of pycnofibers (and {{the demands of}} flight) imply that pterosaurs were endothermic (warm-blooded). The absence of pycnofibers on pterosaur wings suggests that the coat <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> aerodynamic function, lending support {{to the idea that}} pycnofibers evolved to aid pterosaur thermoregulation, as is common in warm-blooded animals, insulation being necessary to conserve the heat created by an endothermic metabolism.|$|E

Some sources claim Jews could only visit the wall if they traveled through Jordan (which {{was not an option}} for Israelis) and <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> Israeli visa stamped in their passports. Only Jordanian soldiers and tourists were to be found there. A vantage point on Mount Zion, from which the Wall could be viewed, became the place where Jews gathered to pray. For thousands of pilgrims, the mount, being the closest location to the Wall under Israeli control, became a substitute site for the traditional priestly blessing ceremony which takes place on the Three Pilgrimage Festivals.|$|E

Boone <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> opportunity to tell his men that he was bluffing to prevent an immediate attack on Boonesborough, however. Boone pursued this strategy so convincingly that many of his men concluded that he had switched his loyalty to the British.|$|E

Walton, Tyler's cousin, had played for Michigan State. He received an official offer from Kentucky on August 16.

5|$|Despite the title, St. John the Baptist Preaching <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> {{obviously}} religious theme. The model, an Italian peasant {{who presented}} himself at Rodin's studio, possessed an idiosyncratic sense of movement that Rodin {{felt compelled to}} capture. Rodin thought of John the Baptist, and carried that association into {{the title of the}} work. In 1880, Rodin submitted the sculpture to the Paris Salon. Critics were still mostly dismissive of his work, but the piece finished third in the Salon's sculpture category.|$|E

Hindman also commenced a campaign of misinformation designed to mislead Federal authorities about the strength of the state's defenses. He also diverted Texas troops bound for Virginia for use in defense of Arkansas. This series of events, combined with harassing tactics, confused the Federal authorities, causing them to fear that they <b>did</b> <b>not</b> <b>have</b> <b>an</b> adequate supply line to conquer the state and soon diverted from a course towards the capital and instead moved to Helena to reestablish a solid supply line.|$|E

Some of the critical factors in its success included local manufacture of vehicles, training instructors to certify emergency medical technicians, adopting training materials to the local context, and branching out to include fire and rescue service response under a united command structure.|$|E
