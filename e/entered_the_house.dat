5|$|The botched arrest {{attempt was}} {{politically}} disastrous for Charles. No English sovereign had ever <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons, and his unprecedented {{invasion of the}} chamber to arrest its members was considered a grave breach of parliamentary privilege. In one stroke Charles destroyed his supporters' efforts to portray him as a defence against innovation and disorder.|$|E
5|$|Bombs often {{landed on}} the estate during the blitz of Bristol. In September 1940, during a raid on the Bristol Aeroplane Company factory at Filton, bombs cut off the estate's water supply, and during a later raid, one bomb badly damaged the lantern roof light over the hallway. In 1946, {{after the end of}} the war, Lady Wraxall applied to the Ministry of Defence for a repair grant, but was turned down. As a result damp, and latterly birds, <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> through the roof light, until the house came into the {{ownership}} of the National Trust and was repaired.|$|E

5|$|David Ramsden (born 2 September 1980) is a {{clothing}} recycler from Dewsbury, near Leeds in West Yorkshire. He <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> on Day 44 {{with four other}} new housemates. With them he was tasked with ensuring that Noirin and Halfwit received the most nominations, but the new housemates failed their task and faced the public vote, though the eviction was ultimately cancelled. On Day 91, David celebrated his 29th birthday, and he received a birthday message from fashion designer Vivienne Westwood, who he claims is his hero.|$|E
5|$|In week eight, in {{the early}} hours of Day 53, Tom voluntarily left the Big Brother House. For the {{shopping}} task the housemates split into two groups, creating human puppets with one housemate providing the head and feet and another providing the arms, and making them dance to music by Girls Aloud and Take That. Visitors to the Big Brother web site decided by voting that the housemates had failed the task. On Day 56, Noirin's ex-boyfriend Isaac <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>House,</b> but left voluntarily shortly after Noirin's eviction on Day 58 with 60.0% of the public vote.|$|E
5|$|Karly Ashworth (born 14 April 1988) is a {{part-time}} glamour model from Fife in Scotland. She was polled {{as one of}} FHM's Top High Street Honeys. She became the seventh housemate after being tricked into believing {{that she had a}} motorbike ridden over her stomach. On Day 39, Karly was nominated for eviction by her fellow housemates. Karly was evicted on Day 44, the same night as her boyfriend, Kenneth, <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>house</b> as a new housemate.|$|E

5|$|The {{prosecution}} {{case was}} that Bamber, motivated by hatred and greed, had left White House Farm around 10pm on 6 August 1985, after dining with his family, {{to drive to}} his home in Head Street, Goldhanger. Later, perhaps {{in the early hours of}} the morning of 7 August, he had returned to the farm on his mother's bicycle—which he had borrowed a few days earlier—cycling along a route that avoided the main roads and approaching the house from the back.

5|$|Disraeli {{was born}} in Bloomsbury, then a part of Middlesex. His father left Judaism after a dispute at his synagogue; young Benjamin became an Anglican {{at the age of}} 12. After several {{unsuccessful}} attempts, Disraeli <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons in 1837. In 1846 the Prime Minister at the time, Sir Robert Peel, split the party over his proposal to repeal the Corn Laws, which involved ending the tariff on imported grain. Disraeli clashed with Peel in the House of Commons. Disraeli became a major figure in the party. When Lord Derby, the party leader, thrice formed governments in the 1850s and 1860s, Disraeli served as Chancellor of the Exchequer and Leader of the House of Commons.|$|E

5|$|In week six, on Day 39, Big Brother told Siavash and Dogface that, {{because they}} had {{discussed}} nominations earlier in the week, they would face eviction if they uttered a single profanity before 3 p.m. They both failed and therefore faced the public vote, along with Karly and Noirin who received the most nominations. The shopping task consisted of nine separate challenges from previous editions of Big Brother, in which housemates had to compete against former contestants (see the week seven shopping task section). The housemates failed to pass the required number of challenges and therefore failed the overall task. On Day 44, five new housemates, Kenneth, Bea, David, Hira and Tom <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> and Karly became the seventh person to be evicted with 50.4% of the vote.|$|E
5|$|Two {{accounts}} exist {{regarding the}} adoption of Rakotomavo, whom Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana designated to rule after him as King Andriambelomasina. According to the first version, Rakotomavo and Mandriamohara were sons of Rangorimanana. Andriantsimitoviaminiandriana sent messengers to Ranorimanana to bring the boys to him with the instructions {{to take note of}} which child stood closer to the central pillar (andry, symbolic of strength) of their mother's house. When the boys <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>house,</b> Rakotomavo stood closer to the pillar. The children's relatives refused to allow the messengers to take the children, so the king sent them back with rice, milk, honey and other goods and successfully lured the boys away.|$|E
5|$|When {{someone is}} {{within range of}} a trap, a sensor bar will move into a red zone. Activating the trap at this moment will capture them. If the trap is {{activated}} when the bar {{is not in the}} red zone, the trap will not work and will become disabled {{for a short period of}} time. The traps will also only work if the access code is correct. There are six possible access codes, and the player must eavesdrop into the conversations to find out when the Martins change the code. When a new code is learned, the player must wait until the speaker leaves the room before changing the access code to the correct color to maintain control of the traps.

5|$|Based on {{conflicting}} political, {{religious and}} social positions, the English Civil War was fought between {{the supporters of}} Parliament and those of King Charles I, known colloquially as Roundheads and Cavaliers respectively. This was an interwoven part of the wider multifaceted Wars of the Three Kingdoms, involving Scotland and Ireland. The Parliamentarians were victorious, Charles I was executed and the kingdom replaced by the Commonwealth. Leader of the Parliament forces, Oliver Cromwell declared himself Lord Protector in 1653; a period of personal rule followed. After Cromwell's death and the resignation of his son Richard as Lord Protector, Charles II was invited to return as monarch in 1660, in a move called the Restoration. After the Glorious Revolution of 1688, it was constitutionally established that King and Parliament should rule together, though Parliament would have the real power. This was established with the Bill of Rights in 1689. Among the statutes set down were that the law could only be made by Parliament {{and could not be}} suspended by the King, also that the King could not impose taxes or raise an army without the prior approval of Parliament. Also since that time, no British monarch has <b>entered</b> <b>the</b> <b>House</b> of Commons when it is sitting, which is annually commemorated at the State Opening of Parliament by the British monarch when the doors of the House of Commons are slammed {{in the face of the}} monarch's messenger, symbolising the rights of Parliament and its independence from the monarch. With the founding of the Royal Society in 1660, science was greatly encouraged.|$|E
