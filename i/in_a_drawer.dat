25|$|On {{the morning}} of June 12, 1994 (3 Tammuz 5754), Schneerson died at the Beth Israel Medical Center and was buried at the Ohel next to his father-in-law, Rabbi Yosef Yitzchak Schneersohn, at Montefiore Cemetery in Queens, New York. Shortly after Schneerson's death, the executors of his will {{discovered}} several notebooks <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> in his office, in which Schneerson had written his scholarly thoughts and religious musings from his earliest years. The majority of entries in these journals date between the years 1928 and 1950 and were subsequently published.|$|E
25|$|Judge Crater met Stella Mance Wheeler in 1917 when {{he served}} as her divorce lawyer, and they married seven days after her divorce was finalized. Mrs. Crater {{remained}} at their vacation home in Belgrade Lakes, Maine during the search for her husband, until January 20, 1931, when she allegedly discovered checks, stocks, bonds, and a note written by the judge <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> that had been empty when police checked earlier. Without Crater's income, Mrs. Crater was unable to maintain the couple's fashionable Fifth Avenue apartment and was evicted. She petitioned to have the judge declared officially dead in July 1937; she was reportedly living on the $12 per week (approximately $ in 2013 funds) that she earned as a telephone operator in Belgrade Lakes.|$|E
25|$|Walker {{invited the}} author of the OLC memo, John Yoo, to meet with the senior DOD lawyers, both uniformed and {{civilian}} at the Pentagon, which Yoo did twice, explaining the cases in detail and the President's authority and responding to all questions. Mora met with Yoo, who defended the Justice Department's legal analysis, and told Mora the President had the authority to order the application of torture, not that he should but that the Commander in Chief had the authority to do so {{for the safety of the}} nation. Mora then met with Haynes, and advised him of his opinion that the Working Group's legal analysis, taken from the Department of Justice legal memorandum, was flawed, and should be put <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> and “never... see the light of day again.” The Working Group never relied upon the extreme power of the Commander in Chief as the additional techniques they recommended did not approach what could be construed as torture. The Working Group voted unanimously to send forth the recommended techniques to Secretary Rumsfeld, who adopted the majority of them. The Administration later asked the Justice Department to review the adopted techniques, which they did, finding them consistent with law. John Yoo did not participate in the later analysis.|$|E

50|$|By {{the time}} they found the infant more people from the {{neighbourhood}} had gathered outside and the River Thames Police were summoned. The first officer on the scene was Charles Horton. As nothing {{appeared to have been}} taken, money was in the till and £152 was found <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawers</b> <b>in</b> the bedroom, {{there seemed to be no}} motive. A thief might have been scared off before he finished, but the other possibility was some sort of revenge attack by someone who knew Timothy Marr.|$|R

Medhi was the next to be killed, the youngest and the only son. When her attempts to strangle her child again failed, Lhermitte cut Medhi's throat and washed the knife afterward in the bathroom sink.|$|E
500|$|Wark {{was born}} on 4 August 1957, in Glasgow Royal Maternity Hospital to parents Alex and Helen. The third of four children, he has an older sister Wilma, older brother Alex and younger brother Andrew. [...] The family lived in a four-storey {{tenement}} block in Partick. The family was impoverished: Wark's parents could not afford a cot and as a small child, he slept <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> from a sideboard. [...] Although christened John, Wark was soon referred to by his family as Johnny, a diminutive that stuck throughout his footballing career.|$|E

500|$|Although no {{complete}} {{individuals were}} found, some material {{was discovered in}} association, including a nearly complete tail, hip, several dorsal vertebrae and some limb elements of one individual.

The mount was dismantled during the museum renovation in 2006/2007, and re-mounted in an improved pose by [...] Some other material, including a braincase and spine, was thought to have been misplaced or destroyed during World War II.

500|$|About {{two months}} later, Roy took Bardwell {{out to look}} at rings [...] "just {{to get an idea}} of what she'd like". On June 16, 2007, while both were at Roy's home in Renton, Washington, he sent Bardwell a text message instructing her to look <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> in his closet, telling her that she could have {{whatever}} she found. Bardwell discovered a ring that she had mentioned she liked, at which point Roy entered the room with their son and said, [...] "BJ wants to know if you will marry his daddy". Bardwell immediately accepted. Roy said the entire proposal was [...] "free-styled".|$|E
500|$|The plot {{had become}} too familiar, as film {{historian}} Douglas Brode notes, and it [...] "seemed likely the play would be put away <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> [...]" [...] Yet Elliott Nugent's film, The Cat and the Canary (1939), proved successful. Nugent [...] "had the inspired idea to openly play the piece for laughs." [...] The film was produced by Paramount and starred comedic actor Bob Hope. Hope played Wally Campbell, a character based on Creighton Hale's performance as Paul Jones. One critic suggests that Hope developed the character better than Hale and was funnier and more engaging. In later years, Universal themselves acquired {{the rights to the}} 1939 version.|$|E

500|$|Officers also searched 5Eaton Row, {{into which}} Lucan had moved early in 1973, and after {{interviewing}} [...] his mother (who {{had called to}} take the children to her home in StJohn's Wood), his last address at 72aElizabeth Street. Nothing untoward was found; on the bed, a suit and shirt lay alongside a book on Greek shipping millionaires, and Lucan's wallet, car keys, money, driving licence, handkerchief and spectacles were on a bedside table. His passport was <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> and his blue Mercedes-Benz parked outside, its engine cold and its battery flat. Ranson then visited Veronica Lucan at St George's Hospital. Although heavily sedated, {{she was able to}} describe what had happened to her. A police officer was left to guard her, should her assailant return. Rivett's body was taken to the mortuary, and a search was undertaken of all local basement areas and gardens, skips and open spaces.|$|E
500|$|On December 2, 1922, {{nearly all}} of Hemingway's early writing– his juvenilia and {{apprentice}} fiction, including the duplicates– was lost. He had been sent on assignment to cover the Conference of Lausanne, leaving Hadley, who was sick with a cold, behind in Paris. In Lausanne he spent days covering the conference, and the evenings drinking with Lincoln Steffens. Before setting off to meet him in Switzerland, thinking {{he would want to}} show his work to Steffens, Hadley packed all his manuscripts into a valise which was subsequently stolen at Gare de Lyon train station. Although angry and upset, Hemingway went with Hadley to Chamby (Montreux) to ski, and apparently did not post a reward for the recovery of the valise. An early story, [...] "Up in Michigan", survived the loss because Gertrude Stein had told him it was unprintable (in part because of a seduction scene), and he had stuffed it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer.</b>|$|E
500|$|In 2012, the British {{palaeontologist}} Mark P. Witton {{reported the}} [...] "rediscovery" [...] of a jaw-piece {{that belonged to}} specimen NHMUK R3877, but which had been neglected <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> for a century, perhaps removed shortly after Hooley's 1913 article. Though Hooley included an illustration of this piece, it was not incorporated into his reconstruction of the skull, and the skull length he proposed was repeated by workers until Witton's report. Witton concluded that the jaw-piece represented almost the entire missing portion of the skull, and suggested that the skull {{would have been much}} shorter than previously assumed, making I. latidens very distinct from other istiodactylids. Witton's updated skull reconstruction was different enough from the skull of I. sinensis for him to conclude they did not belong in the same genus, but he advised against placing I. sinensis in its own genus. Witton pointed out that the two Istiodactylus species had been grouped with Liaoxipterus brachyognathus in previous studies, and that I. sinensis may instead have been a species in the genus Liaoxipterus, or even the same species, since they were found in the same formation and had few differences. He provisionally retained the existing taxonomy, awaiting further investigation of the issue.|$|E

500|$|Howard's grandmother, Jannie Mae Howard, was the {{daughter}} of sharecroppers from Belzoni, Mississippi. She had four daughters by her 19th birthday, including Howard's mother Helena. Helena was an employee at a Chicago restaurant when she became pregnant with Juwan. Howard's father, Leroy Watson, had just returned from the Army to a phone company job in Chicago. The two married quickly once they realized Helena was pregnant. For Howard's first week of life, his high school junior mother kept him <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> at Jannie Mae's house. Helena, who was 17 years old, {{did not want to be}} restricted or burdened raising her child, so Jannie Mae adopted him. His biological father, Leroy Watson, Jr., wanted to name him Leroy Watson, III, but his grandmother rejected the suggestion, insisting on Juwan Antonio Howard. [...] Although his mother visited on occasion as he was growing up, his grandmother raised him, along with two cousins. Howard has no siblings and is not close to his biological parents; his grandmother was the primary influence in his life. He moved with her to several low-income Chicago South Side projects; she kept him out of trouble and away from gangs as he was growing up. One of their residences was a three-bedroom apartment on 69th Street on the South Side of Chicago. As he blossomed under his grandmother's influence and discipline, he became her [...] "pride and joy".|$|E
500|$|The pilot {{episode of}} Sit Down, Shut Up {{was written by}} series creator Mitchell Hurwitz and {{directed}} by Dwayne Carey-Hill. It was originally written by Hurwitz in 2000, but he [...] "kept it <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer</b> for a long time" [...] and brought it out when he needed money. The idea for the series {{was based on the}} Australian situation comedy of the same name. He pitched his adaption to different networks that were interested in the concept, but they turned it down, because the characters were [...] "way too broad and way too self-centered and oblivious," [...] and they told him that he had to rewrite it. The Fox network picked it up in April 2008 under the name Class Dismissed, later changed to Sit Down, Shut Up. Hurwitz's adaption was originally planned to be live-action like its counterpart, but he decided to make it an animated series to [...] "avoid some work". He chose to use real images as backgrounds after he saw Mo Willems' Knuffle Bunny in a book store. He then contacted Willems to design the characters for Sit Down, Shut Up. The images for the school were taken at a school next door to the Rough Draft Studios, the series' animation studio. Production of the series halted in June 2008, when the writers found out that they would be {{under the jurisdiction of the}} IATSE Animation Guild, instead of Writers Guild of America (WGA). A month later, the writers and the production company, Sony Pictures, reached an agreement saying that the writers would still be covered by the IATSE, but their contract would be the same as the WGA's in certain areas. This made Sit Down, Shut Up the only primetime animated series on Fox not to be covered by the WGA. During this process, head writer Bill Oakley left the series.|$|E
500|$|Terri is {{the wife}} of glee club {{director}} Will Schuester (Matthew Morrison). Believing herself to be pregnant, Terri pressures Will to quit {{his job as a}} Spanish teacher at William McKinley High School, in order to take a better paying job as an accountant. She later discovers she has actually experienced a hysterical pregnancy, but hides this from Will, afraid he will leave her. After she confides her deception in her sister Kendra (Jennifer Aspen), Terri approaches the recently revealed to be pregnant cheerleader Quinn Fabray (Dianna Agron), with an interest in her baby. Terri briefly becomes the school nurse, albeit unqualified, and uses the position to keep a closer eye on Will, whom she believes may be cheating on her with guidance counsellor Emma Pillsbury (Jayma Mays). She is fired as the nurse by Principal Figgins (Iqbal Theba), however, after it is discovered that she has given the glee club members pseudoephedrine tablets. Terri and Kendra bully her OB-GYN (Kenneth Choi) into faking an ultrasound to convince Will the baby is real. In the episode [...] "Mattress," [...] Will uncovers Terri's ruse when he discovers her pregnancy pad <b>in</b> <b>a</b> <b>drawer.</b> He angrily confronts her, then walks out, but remains undecided over whether to end their marriage. Terri begins attending therapy, but Will tells her he no longer loves her and is leaving her. Later, in [...] "Hell-O," [...] Terri returns to warn Emma that she is not going to give Will up without a fight, and also reveals that the song that Will planned on dancing with Emma is also the song Terri and Will had danced to at their prom. Despite this attempted sabotage, Terri and Will still finalize their divorce; Terri then briefly befriends Glee member and newly hired Finn Hudson (Cory Monteith) as her protegee at Sheets-N-Things, because he reminds her of a younger Will.|$|E
