5|$|In Germany, the Crusade {{was seen}} as a huge debacle with many monks writing that it could only have been the work of the Devil. The {{anonymous}} monk who wrote the Annales Herbipolenses chronicle in Würzburg mentioned that for decades afterwards, noble families in Germany were ransoming back knights who had been taken prisoner in Anatolia using Armenian middle-men. The camp followers who had been taken prisoner and sold into slavery by the Turks were not so lucky. Of the 113 individuals known by name to {{have been involved in the}} Crusade, 22 died, 42 returned home while the fate of the last 49 <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> Despite the distaste for the memory of the Second Crusade, the experience of the crusade had notable impact on German literature, with many epic poems of the late 12th century featuring battle scenes clearly inspired by the fighting in the crusade.|$|E
5|$|The exact date of his {{reception}} <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> According to Maiorescu's own recollections, written some {{decades after}} the event, Creangă was in attendance at a Junimea meeting of 1871, during which Gheorghe Costaforu proposed to transform the club into a political party. The information was considered dubious by Z. Ornea, who argued that the episode may have been entirely invented by the Junimist leader, and noted that it contradicted both Negruzzi's accounts and minutes kept by A. D. Xenopol. According to Ornea's assessment, {{with the exception of}} literary critic Vladimir Streinu, all of Creangă's biographers have come to dismiss Maiorescu's statement. Several sources mention that the future writer was introduced to the society by Eminescu, who was an active member around 1875. This and other details lead Ornea to conclude that membership was granted to Creangă only after the summer break of 1875.|$|E
5|$|The {{origin of}} the {{earliest}} primates, from which both the strepsirrhines and haplorhines (simians and tarsiers) evolved, <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> Both their place of origin and the group from which they evolved are uncertain. Although the fossil record demonstrating their initial radiation across the Northern Hemisphere is very detailed, the fossil record from the tropics—where primates most likely evolved—is very poor, particularly around the time that primates and other major clades (groups consisting of an ancestor and all its descendants) of eutherian mammals were first appearing. Consequently, geneticists and primatologists have used genetic analyses to determine the relatedness between primate lineages {{and the amount of}} time since they diverged. Using this molecular clock, divergence dates for the major primate lineages have suggested that primates evolved more than 80–90mya, nearly 40million years before the first examples of which appear in the fossil record.|$|E

5|$|At the top-secret Icarus Base, {{the group}} is {{introduced}} to Colonel Everett Young (Louis Ferreira), Colonel David Telford (Lou Diamond Phillips), and First Lieutenant Matthew Scott (Brian J. Smith). Wallace's solution is tested but fails to establish a lock. During dinner, three Ha'tak vessels, believed {{to be under the}} control of the Lucian Alliance, attack the planet. An evacuation is begun while the Hammond which is manned by Colonel Samantha Carter (Amanda Tapping) and a squadron of F-302s led by Colonel Telford battle the enemy. Rush, desperate to see his project succeed, enlists Wallace's aid in figuring out what went wrong. Wallace suggests that the final symbol of the address is wrong, and that they should use the symbol for Earth. Rush aborts the dialing sequence to Earth, arguing that the energy release from the exploding planet could follow them through the Gate, and tests the theory, which succeeds. With the planet's unstable core about to go critical and lacking any other means of escape, the remaining survivors in the base (roughly 80 people) are forced to risk heading to an unknown destination. The planet explodes shortly after everyone is evacuated, destroying the three Ha'tak vessels. The Hammond survives, but the fate of those in the base <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery</b> to Stargate Command.|$|E
5|$|The {{earliest}} definite {{reference to}} cricket is dated Monday, 17 January 1597 (i.e., a Julian date which is 1598 by modern reckoning under the Gregorian calendar). It is a deposition in {{the records of}} a legal case at Guildford, Surrey, re {{the use of a}} parcel of land c.1550 and John Derrick, a coroner, testified that he had at that time played cricket on the land when he was a boy. Derrick's testimony makes clear that the sport was being played c.1550, but its true origin <b>is</b> <b>a</b> <b>mystery.</b> All that can be said with a fair degree of certainty is that its beginning was earlier than 1550, somewhere in south-east England within the counties of Kent, Sussex and Surrey. Unlike other games with batsmen, bowlers and fielders, such as stoolball and rounders, cricket can only be played on relatively short grass, especially as the ball was delivered along the ground until the 1760s. Therefore, forest clearings and land where sheep had grazed would have been suitable places to play.|$|E
