40|$|Peripheral {{arterial}} disease (PAD) is {{a common}} disease with increasing prevalence, presenting with <b>impaired</b> <b>walking</b> ability affecting patient's quality of life. PAD epidemiology is known, however, mechanisms underlying functional muscle impairment remain unclear. Using a mouse PAD model, {{aim of this study}} was to assess muscle adaptive responses during early (1  week) and late (5  weeks) disease stages. Unilateral hindlimb ischemia was induced in ApoE−/− mice by iliac artery ligation. Ischemic limb perfusion and oxygenation (Laser Doppler imaging, transcutaneous oxygen pressure assessments) significantly decreased during early and late stage compared to pre-ischemia, however, values were significantly higher during late versus early phase. Number of arterioles and arteriogenesis-linked gene expression increased at later stage. Walking ability, evaluated by forced and voluntary walking tests, remained significantly decreased both at early and late phase without any significant improvement. Muscle glucose uptake ([18 F]fluorodeoxyglucose positron emission tomography) significantly increased during early ischemia decreasing at later stage. Gene expression analysis showed significant shift in muscle M 1 /M 2 macrophages and Th 1 /Th 2 T cells balance toward pro-inflammatory phenotype during early ischemia; later, inflammatory state returned to neutrality. Muscular M 1 /M 2 shift inhibition by a statin prevented <b>impaired</b> <b>walking</b> ability in early ischemia. High-energy phosphate metabolism remained unchanged (31 -Phosphorus magnetic resonance spectroscopy). Results show that rapid transient muscular inflammation contributes to <b>impaired</b> <b>walking</b> capacity while increased glucose uptake may be a compensatory mechanisms preserving immediate limb viability during early ischemia in a mouse PAD model. With time, increased ischemic limb perfusion and oxygenation assure muscle viability although not sufficiently to improve walking impairment.

40|$|Background: The six minute walking {{distance}} test (6 MWD) {{is widely used}} to evaluate exercise capacity in several diseases due to its simplicity and low cost. Aim: To establish reference values for 6 MWD in healthy Chilean individuals. Material and methods: We studied 175 healthy volunteers aged 20 - 80 years (98 women) with normal spirometry and without history of respiratory, cardiovascular or other diseases that could <b>impair</b> <b>walking</b> capacity. The test was performed twice with an interval of 30 min. Heart rate, arterial oxygen saturation (with a pulse oxymeter) and dyspnea were measured {{before and after the}} test. Results: Walking distance was 576 ± 87 m in women and 644 ± 84 m in men (p < 0. 0001).

40|$|In the Welfare Quality ® {{assessment}} {{protocol for}} broilers, the touch test is included {{to assess the}} human–animal relationship in the flock. The test is designed to measure the animals’ fear of humans, assuming that broilers will withdraw from the observer if they are fearful. However, many broilers close to slaughter age have <b>impaired</b> <b>walking</b> ability, and {{the results from the}} touch test may thus be biased by lameness and poor leg health. As the touch test is currently being used in several countries to assess human–animal relationship in broilers, there is an urgent need to examine this potential relationship for a further validation of the test. In the present study, fear of humans was assessed in 50 randomly selected Norwegian broiler flocks, using the touch test as described in the Welfare Quality ® protocol for ty broilers. Leg health was assessed by examining the gait of 150 random birds in each of the flocks, using a six-point gait score scale from 0 to 5. The coefficient for the relationship between touch test score and gait score was 0. 034 (P< 0. 001), indicating that the animals express less fear as assessed by the touch test when the gait scores increase. This implies that the touch test may be confounded by <b>impaired</b> <b>walking</b> ability and therefore might be a suboptimal method of assessing fear of humans and human–animal relationship in broilers. In conclusion, the results from this study suggests that the touch test must be further validated in broilers and perhaps be replaced with a fear test that doesn’t rely on walking ability. </p...|$|E

Friedreich's ataxia typically causes motor abnormalities of the extremities, mainly <b>impairing</b> <b>walking</b> and the coordination of the legs and arms. The myocardium is affected at a later stage of the disease. The extent and timing of myocardial involvement determines the clinical course. Some patients have no cardiac symptoms and cardiac involvement can be established only by electrocardiographic or echocardiographic examination.

To determine if and how regular walking vs. running exercise affects the economy of locomotion in older adults. 15 older adults (69 ± 3 years) who walk ≥ 30 min, 3 x/week for exercise, "walkers" and 15 older adults (69 ± 5 years) who run ≥ 30 min, 3 x/week, "runners" walked on a force-instrumented treadmill at three speeds (0. 75, 1. 25, and 1. 75 m/s). We determined walking economy using expired gas analysis and walking mechanics via ground reaction forces during the last 2 minutes of each 5 minute trial. We compared walking economy between the two groups and to non-aerobically trained young and older adults from a prior study. Older runners had a 7 - 10 % better walking economy than older walkers over the range of speeds tested (p = . 016) and had walking economy similar to young sedentary adults over a similar range of speeds (p = . 237). We found no substantial biomechanical differences between older walkers and runners. In contrast to older runners, older walkers had similar walking economy as older sedentary adults (p =  . 461) and ∼ 26 % worse walking economy than young adults (p<. 0001).

Objective: Characterize the attributes, related concepts and clinical indicators from the references of the nursing diagnosis <b>impaired</b> <b>walking.</b> Materials and methods: Analisys the concept <b>impaired</b> <b>walking,</b> according to Rodgers, among the 3 references of the nursing diagnosis from the last edition(2). Results: The references were published between 1988 and 2004 and they not refer to validation studies. The attributes are: checked the sensitivity of the neuromuscular findings with performance four routine mobility maneuvers: getting up from a chair, sitting down, turning while walking, and raising the feet while walking(3), decreased force production, less motion and force, decreased gait speed(4), fear of falling, curtail in activities, walk speed and distance(5). The related concept are: although hip and knee flexion(3), impaired mobility, impairment in proprioceptive and vibratory sensory system, impaired gait and balance, vestibular changes(4), environment hazard, fall history, lower balance, activity reduction, weight shifting ability, poor physical performance, global weakness, limits of stability (reduction) and lower limb weakness(5). The clinical indicators are: getting up from a chair, sitting down, turning while walking, and raising the feet while walking; the sensory and neuromuscular examination (vision, hearing, frontal reflexes, position sense, tone, coordination, and manual muscle testing) (3); impairment in proprioceptive and vibratory sensory systems; impaired balance, and vestibular changes; pharmaceutical variables; depression and impaired cognition(4), limits of stability, walking speed and lower extremity muscle strength(5).

40|$|As {{wearable}} computers {{become more}} ubiquitous {{in society and}} work environments, there are concerns that their use could be negatively impactful in some settings. Previous research indicates that mobile phone and wearable computer use can <b>impair</b> <b>walking</b> and driving performance, but as these technologies are adopted into hazardous work environments it is less clear what the impact will be. The current research investigated the effects that head mounted display use has on high angle climbing, a task representative of the extreme physical demands of some hazardous occupations (such as firefighting or search and rescue work). We explored the effect that introducing a secondary word reading and later recall task has on both climbing performance (holds per meter climbed and distance covered), and word reading and recall (dual-task effects). We found a decrease in both climbing performance and word recall under dual task conditions. Further, we examined participant climbing motion around word presentation and non-word presentation times during the climbing traverse. We found that participants slowed around word presentations, relative to periods without word presentation. Finally, we compared our results {{to those found in}} previous research using similar dual-tasking paradigms. These comparisons indicated that physical tasks may be more detrimental to word recall than seated tasks, and that visual stimuli might hinder climbing performance more than audible stimuli.

40|$|Contracture is a {{permanent}} shortening of the muscle-tendon-ligament complex that limits joint mobility. Contracture is involved in many diseases (cerebral palsy, stroke, etc.) and can <b>impair</b> <b>walking</b> and other activities of daily living. The {{purpose of this study}} was to quantify the reliability of an exoskeleton designed to emulate lower limb muscle contractures unilaterally and bilaterally during walking. An exoskeleton was built according to the following design criteria: adjustable to different morphologies; respect of the principal lines of muscular actions; placement of reflective markers on anatomical landmarks; and the ability to replicate the contractures of eight muscles of the lower limb unilaterally and bilaterally (psoas, rectus femoris, hamstring, hip adductors, gastrocnemius, soleus, tibialis posterior, and peroneus). Sixteen combinations of contractures were emulated on the unilateral and bilateral muscles of nine healthy participants. Two sessions of gait analysis were performed at weekly intervals to assess the reliability of the emulated contractures. Discrete variables were extracted from the kinematics to analyse the reliability. The exoskeleton did not affect normal walking when contractures were not emulated. Kinematic reliability varied from poor to excellent depending on the targeted muscle. Reliability was good for the bilateral and unilateral gastrocnemius, soleus, and tibialis posterior as well as the bilateral hamstring and unilateral hip adductors. The exoskeleton can be used to replicate contracture on healthy participants. The exoskeleton will allow us to differentiate primary and compensatory effects of muscle contractures on gait kinematics...|$|R
40|$|Since the mid- 1980 s, {{there has}} been {{worldwide}} farming of ratites, particularly with ostriches, emus and rheas for feathers, meat, skin and oil. Most of these ratites are produced commercially outside their native habitat. This has raised concerns about welfare, particularly whether birds are provided the five freedoms: food and water; shelter; health care; alleviation of pain and suffering; and the freedom of movement. This paper reviews {{the factors that influence}} bird welfare before hatch with breeder, egg and hatchery management and after hatch with brooding and rearing systems, stocking density, handling, transport, disease and slaughter. Assessment of bird welfare in each of the production sectors in the industry is based on how well the five freedoms are being met. The review identifies egg handling practices and hatchery hygiene that can {{have a major impact on}} the subsequent health of hatched chicks. In addition, feeding of appropriate diets, reducing stocking density and improving housing can improve bird health and freedom of movement. When the husbandry practice of toe trimming is not practiced according to the best practice method, chronic pain may result and <b>impair</b> <b>walking</b> ability of birds. Stress and injuries to birds can be reduced when birds are handled correctly on farm and in the lairage and are transported using appropriate vehicles.

40|$|AbstractBackgroundIntermittent claudication {{resulting}} from {{peripheral arterial disease}} (PAD) can substantially <b>impair</b> <b>walking</b> function. The Walking Impairment Questionnaire (WIQ) assesses patient self-reported difficulty in walking. Currently this questionnaire is validated for interviewer administration only. Since this can be burdensome in a large clinical trial, we {{examined the effects of}} alternative methods of administration on patient responses on the WIQ. MethodsThe WIQ, which consists of four subscales (pain severity, distance, speed, stairs), was modified to be self-administered or interviewer-administered by telephone. Patients with PAD were recruited from two sites and randomized into two groups: in group 1 the WIQ was self-administered, then telephone-administered; in group 2 the WIQ was telephone-administered, then self-administered. The two administrations occurred 4 to 7 days apart. Additional measures (SF- 36, EQ- 5 D, and PAD symptom scale) and clinical data were included to further assess the validity of the WIQ and symptoms in patients with claudication. Telephone interviews were conducted by trained interviewers using standardized scripts. Two-week test-retest reliability was assessed for both the self-administered WIQ (group 1) and the telephone-administered WIQ (group 2). ResultsSixty patients were recruited at two sites (n = 30 per group). Seventy-eight percent were men; mean patient age was 67. 1 years; and 83 % of patients were white. Mean duration of PAD symptoms was 6. 8 years. No significant differences were observed in WIQ subscale scores between self administration and telephone administration. No interaction effects between order and method of administration were detected. Cronbach α for distance, speed, and stair-climbing subscales ranged from 0. 82 to 0. 94. Correlations among WIQ subscales and the symptom scale were good (r = − 0. 34 to − 0. 57). Correlations of WIQ subscales with physical health subscales of the SF- 36 (r = 0. 24 - 0. 59) were higher than for mental health–related subscales (r = 0. 08 - 0. 26). ConclusionsThe modified WIQ demonstrated good reliability and validity with both methods of administration. These results suggest that the self-administered and telephone-administered versions of the WIQ can be used reliably and efficiently in clinical trials...|$|R

40|$|SummaryIn the {{mammalian}} {{central nervous}} system, slow synaptic excitation involves the activation of metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs). It {{has been proposed}} that C 1 -type transient receptor potential (TRPC 1) channels underlie this synaptic excitation, but our analysis of TRPC 1 -deficient mice does not support this hypothesis. Here, we show unambiguously that it is TRPC 3 that is needed for mGluR-dependent synaptic signaling in mouse cerebellar Purkinje cells. TRPC 3 is the most abundantly expressed TRPC subunit in Purkinje cells. In mutant mice lacking TRPC 3, both slow synaptic potentials and mGluR-mediated inward currents are completely absent, while the synaptically mediated Ca 2 + release signals from intracellular stores are unchanged. Importantly, TRPC 3 knockout mice exhibit an <b>impaired</b> <b>walking</b> behavior. Taken together, our results establish TRPC 3 as {{a new type of}} postsynaptic channel that mediates mGluR-dependent synaptic transmission in cerebellar Purkinje cells and is crucial for motor coordination...|$|E
40|$|BACKGROUND: Mutations in a gene {{encoding}} a novel protein {{of unknown}} function-the ganglioside-induced differentiation-associated protein 1 gene (GDAP 1) -are associated with the autosomal recessive Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease type 4 A (CMT 4 A). OBJECTIVE: To investigate the role of GDAP 1 mutations in causing autosomal recessive neuropathies in an Italian population. METHODS AND RESULTS: 76 patients with severe early onset polyneuropathy and possible autosomal recessive inheritance were screened for mutations. A T>G transversion (c. 347 T>G) at codon 116 (M 116 R) was detected in four affected subjects from three apparently unrelated families. All patients had early onset of disease with pronounced foot deformities and <b>impaired</b> <b>walking.</b> Neurophysiological studies showed an extremely variable expression. Sural nerve biopsies revealed signs of both de-remyelination and axonal impairment, the most prominent feature being a severe loss of larger fibres.

40|$|OBJECTIVES: The {{extent to}} which {{gastrocnemius}} muscle and Achilles tendon properties contribute to the <b>impaired</b> <b>walking</b> endurance of claudicants is not known. METHODS: Ultrasound images quantified muscle architecture of the lateral and medial gastrocnemius (GL and GM) and were combined with dynamometry during plantarflexor contractions to calculate tendon stress, strain, stiffness, the Young modulus, and hysteresis. Key parameters were entered into multiple regression models to explain walking endurance. RESULTS: Worse disease severity {{was significantly associated with}} longer fascicle: tendon length ratios (GL R = - 0. 789 and GM R = - 0. 828) and increased tendon hysteresis (R = - 0. 740). Walking endurance could be explained by GL and GM pennation angle, maximum tendon force, tendon hysteresis, and disease severity (R(2) = ∼ 0. 6). CONCLUSIONS: Peripheral arterial disease was associated with functionally important changes in muscle and tendon properties, including the utilization of stored elastic energy. Interventions known to target these characteristics should be adopted as a means to improve walking endurance. This article is protected by copyright. All rights reserved...|$|E

While at the hospital, Warner also suffered a stroke that <b>impaired</b> his <b>walking</b> ability and forced him to use a cane {{for the rest of his}} life. [...] Six days after his stroke, he left the hospital and decided to sell forty-two of his thoroughbred racehorses. This subterfuge proved too much for Warner and he and his family never spoke to Jack again; when Jack made a surprise appearance at Harry's San Fernadino ranch, to attend Harry's 1957 wedding anniversary to Rea Levinson, nobody in the Warner family attending the event spoke to Jack. [...] All Warner was now dedicated to doing was raising horses.|$|R
40|$|Perhaps {{walking and}} chewing gum is effortless, but walking and {{tracking}} moving objects is not. Multiple object tracking is <b>impaired</b> by <b>walking</b> from one location to another, suggesting that updating {{location of the}} self puts demands on object tracking processes. Here, we quantified the cost of self-motion {{in terms of the}} tracking load. Participants in a virtual environment tracked a variable number of targets (1 - 5) among distractors while either staying in one place or moving along a path that was similar to the objects’ motion. At the end of each trial, participants decided whether a probed dot was a target or distractor. As in our previous work, self-motion significantly impaired performance in tracking multiple targets. Quantifying tracking capacity for each individual under move versus stay conditions further revealed that self-motion during tracking produced a cost to capacity of about 0. 8 (&# 177; 0. 2) objects. Tracking your own motion is worth about one object, suggesting that updating the location of the self is similar, but perhaps slightly easier, than updating locations of objects...|$|R
40|$|The {{ability to}} {{navigate}} {{through the world}} is an essential capability to humans. In a variety of situations, {{people do not have}} the time, the opportunity or the capability to learn the layout of the environment before visiting an area. Examples include soldiers in the field entering an unknown building, firefighters responding to an emergency, or a visually <b>impaired</b> person <b>walking</b> through the city. In absence of external source of localization (such as GPS), the system must rely on internal sensing to provide navigation guidance to the user. Inordertoaddressreal-worldsituations,themethodmustprovidespatiallyextended, temporally consistentnavigation guidance, through cluttered and dynamic environments. While recent research has largely focused on metric methods based on calibrated cameras, the work presented in this thesis demonstrates a novel approach to navigation using uncalibrated cameras. During the first visit of the environment, the method builds a topological representation of the user’s exploration path, which we refer to as the place graph. Themethodthenprovidesnavigationguidancefromanyplacetoanyotherintheexplored environment. On one hand, a localization algorithm determines the location of the user in the graph. On the other hand, a rotation guidance algorithm provides a directional cu...|$|R
