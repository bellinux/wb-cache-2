40|$|In {{the present}} work, the changes of Nafion((R)) - 115 {{membrane}} porosity {{in the presence}} of ethanol aqueous solutions of different concentrations were determined by weighing vacuum-dried and ethanol solution-equilibrated membranes. It was found that membrane porosity increases as ethanol concentration increases. Membrane electrode assemblies (MEAs) have been prepared by following both the conventional and the <b>decal</b> <b>transfer</b> method. The ethanol crossover through these two MEAs was electrochemically quantified by a voltammetric method. A 10 h stability test of direct ethanol fuel cell (DEFC) at a current density of 50 mA cm(- 2) was carried out. It was found that the electrode preparation procedure has an obvious effect on ethanol crossover and direct ethanol fuel cell's performance and stability. The single DEFC test results showed that about 15 and 34 % of the original peak power density was lost after 10 h of life test for the MEAs prepared by the <b>decal</b> <b>transfer</b> method and the conventional method, respectively. Electrochemical impedance spectrum (EIS) results of the MEAs showed that, {{in the case of the}} membrane electrode assembly prepared by the following <b>decal</b> <b>transfer</b> method, the internal cell resistance was almost the same, 0. 236 Ohm cm(2) before the life test and 0. 239 Ohm cm(2) after 10 h of life test, while the respective values for the membrane electrode assembly by the conventional method are 0. 289 and 0. 435 Ohm cm(2). It is supposed that the improved cell performance with MEA by the <b>decal</b> <b>transfer</b> method could be resorted to both a better contact between the catalyst layer and the electrolyte membrane and higher catalyst utilization. Furthermore, based on the experimental results, the increased internal cell resistance and the degraded single DEFC performance could be attributed to the delamination of the catalyst layer from the electrolyte membrane.

This study investigates the effect of interface structure on cell performance and water transport in the MPL. Water distribution in cross sections of multiple layers were observed by a freezing method, where the cell is cooled below freezing temperature in short time and the water was observed in ice form by Cryo-SEM. The results show that a membrane electrode assembly (MEA) using the GDE method improves cell performance at high current densities.

40|$|Creating {{in vitro}} microenvironments {{for the study}} of {{important}} biological processes, examples of which include chemotaxis, haptotaxis, axonal guidance and angiogenesis, has been a relevant research focus for many years. Microfabrication techniques involving soft lithography, microfluidic devices and direct-write assembly can be used to create such microenvironments. Soft lithography techniques, which typically include microcontact printing and <b>decal</b> <b>transfer,</b> rely on elastomeric molds, stamps or flexible photomasks to create patterns on or transfer patterns to, an underlying surface; these molds or stamps themselves have also been used for study. In microfluidic devices, small fluid volumes are transported through microchannels via gravity or pressure-driven methods. Biological studies are either conducted within the gradients maintained by laminar flow through the microchannels, or on the residually patterned underlying rigid surface, created via physi-adsorption or through chemical interactions with the surface. Both soft lithography and residual substrate microfluidic patterning approaches yield planar patterned substrates. In contrast, fluidic gradients maintained in microchannels are three-dimensional in nature, but are only used for specific applications???e. g. the study of non adherent cell types such as white blood cells. Recent studies, however, have shown that different cell types present important biological differences, in their differentiation, proliferation rates, migration and cell signaling, in two- versus three-dimensional culture systems. Thus, there has been increased interest in the development of three-dimensional fabrication techniques to create microenvironments that can better mimic those found in vivo. Direct-write assembly {{is an example of a}} three-dimensional fabrication method that enables the creation of micro-periodic structures with well defined features and an interconnected porous network, 1 - 100 ??m in size. Other 3 D fabrication techniques include electrospinning, solvent/particulate leaching and freeze drying, however they usually yield random three-dimensional structures with an unpredictable porous structure.

30|$|In this work, we {{demonstrate}} a simple fluidic-assembly method for highly oriented SWCNTs patterns, using a dip-coating process onto a topographically heterogeneous interface of alternating non-polar (hydrophobic) PDMS strips on the polar (hydrophilic) SiO 2 substrate. Well-defined PDMS nano-strips {{were created by}} solvent-assisted <b>decal</b> <b>transfer</b> lithography (sa-DTL) by utilizing irreversible bonding and anisotropic swelling [27]. The transferred PDMS skin layer acts as a non-wetting region against non-specific deposition of SWCNTs and induces a spontaneous, large-area assembly after selective wetting and drying. One {{important aspect of the}} current strategy, as compared to previous chemical patterning methods [28], is the use of a hydrophobic, uniformly defined physical structure (~ 100  nm height) instead of chemically patterned monolayer or multilayer of SAMs. Such physically defined patterns exhibit chemical and mechanical stability for a long time. Another key aspect is the introduction of a dip-coating process as a scalable and reproducible deposition method. Unlike previous deposition processes such as direct dipping and spin coating, the dip-coating process allows us to achieve precise and selective integration of highly aligned SWCNTs onto hydrophilic locations of a topographically modified surface. As described shortly, the positioning process was width-dependent, such that the alignment accuracy was increased with decreasing the pattern width below ~ 1  μm. We further demonstrate that the aligned arrays of SWCNTs can be used for a high-performance SWCNTs-FET device with high current density and turn-off ratio.|$|E
40|$|In {{the present}} paper, {{the effect of}} {{electrode}} preparation procedure on the structural properties of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) and consequently {{on the performance of}} direct methanol fuel cells (DMFCs) was investigated. Commercial PtRu black anode catalyst and Pt black cathode catalyst were characterized by XRD in their initial form and in their intermediate and final states after each step involved in catalyst-coated membrane electrode preparation procedure by a <b>decal</b> <b>transfer</b> method (DTM). XRD results demonstrated that the DTM process has a significant effect on the catalyst structural properties, especially on the particle size of Pt black cathode catalyst. It is also discussed that among all the steps involved in the electrode fabrication procedure, catalyst ink preparation and high temperature transfer process are key factors affecting the particle size of Pt black catalyst. Furthermore, {{it was found that the}} maximum power density of the single DMFC using a MEA fabricated by the DTM, when air is used as oxidant, is more than two times greater than that of the cell using conventionally prepared MEA, and more than three times greater when pure oxygen is used as oxidant. This could be attributed to the easier mass transportation due to the thinner catalyst layer and the better contact between the catalyst layer and the electrolyte membrane in the former case, even if, according to in situ CO stripping voltammetry results in the fuel cell anode environment, the surface composition of PtRu anode has been changed.

40|$|Polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS), due to {{its unique}} {{characteristics}} including biocompatibility, elasticity (which allows it to be flexibly moulded into the desired shape), optical transparency, and its low-cost provides a valuable advantage as a building material for the fabrication of microfluidics-based lab-on-chip devices and micro-contact printing [1, 2] moulds that allow parallel deposition of various materials on a target surface. A range of methodologies such as wet chemical etching, dry plasma etching, <b>decal</b> <b>transfer</b> microlithography, and bond-detach method have been utilised for creating patterns in PDMS. However, {{one of the most}} commonly used approaches for the prototyping of PDMS for such applications is soft-lithography. This involves the use of a clean-room based UV-lithography step that uses expensive custom-designed masks for the fabrication of a master-mould with structures that are then duplicated via stamping of this master to produce a secondary-mould in PDMS, which is then used for micro-contact printing applications. Even though this lithographic procedure can routinely produce high-resolution micron-scale structures, the procedure is time-consuming and expensive. Instead, for the production of the master, we propose as a cheap alternative to expensive UV-lithography, a mask-less laser-based procedure which does not rely on cleanroom access. Similar to the soft-lithographic procedure, the process is two-step and allows the creation of high-quality sub-micron to millimetre-scale features, {{in a wide range of}} materials, with the added advantage of being able to fabricate complex and differently-shaped structures adjacent to each other, in either a sequential or a single-step.

Solving the forward problem on a mesh enables applications such as splines on surfaces, Laplacian smoothing and remeshing. Combining the forward and inverse problems allows us to define a correspondence mapping be-tween two different meshes based on provided corresponding point pairs, enabling texture transfer, compatible remeshing, morphing and more.

As they were held together by screws, models in 1/24 and 1/18 were also commonly issued in kit form (later, 1/43 kits appeared as well).While vehicles in the kit ranges used the same castings as their contemporaries in the fully assembled ranges, the kits often depicted different versions, usually in racing or rally style.

40|$|Includes abstract. Includes bibliographical references. Of {{the various}} types of fuel cells, Polymer Electrolyte Fuel Cells (PEFCs) have already been {{demonstrated}} in transportation appliances from light-duty vehicles to buses and in portable appliances including laptops and cell phones. A key component of a PEFC is its platinum electrocatalyst. With an estimated 75 % of the world’s platinum reserves and resources in South Africa, local development of this technology will allow South Africa to become {{a major player in the}} growing hydrogen economy. This project therefore forms part of the Department of Science and Technologies strategy, to develop fuel cell technology in South Africa. More specifically, this study aims to contribute to the development of membrane electrode assembly (MEA) platform technology at the HySA/Catalysis Centre. In order to achieve this goal, a catalyst coated membrane (CCM) fabrication procedure was implemented using a newly acquired screen printer. In this procedure, catalyst ink is forced through a mesh onto a substrate, where it can then be transferred to a membrane via <b>decal</b> <b>transfer</b> to form a CCM. Two gas diffusions layers can then be placed on either side of the CCM forming a 5 -layered MEA. Characterisation techniques of the catalyst ink, CCM and 5 -layered MEA were successfully implemented such that future researchers can expand on the ideas. Catalyst inks with varying amounts of isopropanol, 1, 2 -propanediol and water were screened for their suitability for screen printing. In particular the catalyst ink rheology required for a smooth and even printed surface was determined for a given screen and squeegee combination. With all the established steps in pace, screen printing proved to be a fast and reliable approach for CCM fabrication with potential for future scale up and commercialisation. The fabricated CCMs performed on a par with a commercial Ion Power CCM, but under performed in comparison to a commercial Johnson Matthey (JM) MEA. Possible reasons for this include improved materials in the JM MEA and cell conditions favouring the JM MEA. Future projects which specifically arise from this work entail an investigation into the water management of the fuel cell environment at HySA/Catalysis, as well as a modification of the various steps in order to optimise the process and in doing so manufacture commercially viable MEAs...|$|E
40|$|The {{lifetime}} {{of a direct}} methanol fuel cell (DMFC) is mostly determined by the degradation of its active component, the membrane electrode assembly (MEA). Besides degradation of the proton conducting membrane, {{the aging of the}} electrodes and especially the catalysts therein is the major limiting factor. One of the catalyst degradation mechanisms is ruthenium dissolution. This work is the first extensive study on the dissolution, migration and deposition of ruthenium in a DMFC single cell during early operation, i. e. between first start-up of the cell till approx. 100 h of operation. To analyze the dissolution process it is necessary to track the trace amounts of ruthenium being dissolved and transported through the MEA. For this task x-ray fluorescence spectroscopy (XRF), x-ray absorption spectroscopy (XAS), inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (ICP-MS) and cyclic voltammetry (CV) were used. The characterization of the catalysts itself was carried out by x-ray powder diffraction (XRD) and x-ray photoelectron spectroscopy (XPS). Fuel cell tests were explicitly not including any extreme operation conditions, such as fuel starvation or accelerated aging protocols. Each DMFC test was run at one specific potential {{for the duration of the}} test. After operation the cells were disassembled, the MEA removed, dried and cathode and anode catalysts removed from the membrane to be analyzed separately. Two different MEA fabrication techniques, wet spray coating and dry <b>decal</b> <b>transfer,</b> were used to produce MEAs. The fabrication techniques are compared in respect to their influence on ruthenium dissolution. It is shown, that the crystalline fraction of the commercial platinum-ruthenium on carbon anode catalyst and platinum on carbon cathode catalyst does not change under the operation conditions investigated. The mean lattice parameters of the platinum and platinum-ruthenium catalysts are 3. 916 and 3. 866, respectively, as determined by XRD measurements. Both values are in good agreement with the lattice parameters reported in literature. Also the XPS measurements do not show any significant change in the catalyst composition after operation in the DMFC. XAS measurements gave evidence that a transfer of ruthenium already takes place during fabrication of the MEA. While XAS could only be used for qualitative analysis of the samples, XRF and complementary ICP-MS analyses provided quantitative measurements for the migrated ruthenium. Even though it was expected that the wet spray coating technique causes a higher amount of ruthenium to migrate onto the cathode side, the Ru transfer of both techniques in the order of 0. 02 wt...|$|E
