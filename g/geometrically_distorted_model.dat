In {{addition to the}} computational cost required for this method, this paper considers the more important problem of false positives. The maximal number of detections that can be performed in a geometrical search is bounded by the maximum false positive detection probability required by the watermark application. We show that image and key dependency in the watermark detector leads to different false positive detection probabilities for geometrical searches for different images and keys.

40|$|Abstract: Due to {{the lack}} of {{invariant}} property of discrete wavelet transform (DWT), the DWT based watermarking schemes are relatively vulnerable to the watermarking attacks such as geometric variations (i. e., rotation and translation etc.). To improve the reliability of the DWT based watermark detection, this paper introduces the new multiresolution based image registration method that is used to recover the <b>geometrically</b> <b>distorted</b> image before detecting the watermark. Since the proposed registration method does not require either the original image or any control point (invariant feature), it can be implemented by the blindbased DWT based watermarking scheme. Simulation results show that the proposed registration method provides the further improvement of the DWT based watermark detection process...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Recently the entropy-similarity measure {{has been}} {{introduced}} for the registration of image pairs prior to subtraction in medical imaging e. g. di-gital subtraction angiography (DSA). The registration is based on motion-vec-tor fields estimated with a template-matching techniques. The entropy is cal-culated via weighted grey-value histograms of the difference-image template and measures the degree of histogram dispersion in case of misregistration. In this paper, a generalization of the underlying concept is presented. We prove that any strictly convex function {{can be used as}} histogram-weighting function leading to a suitable similarity measure. The quality of the histogram-based measures is compared to other frequently used similarity measures. As a result the energy-similarity measure {{turns out to be the}} most suitable measure for template matching. The success of the registration will be demonstrated with a <b>geometrically</b> <b>distorted</b> pair of images taken of the abdomen. ...|$|R

It is shown that when forming a crystal, B 80 cages are <b>geometrically</b> <b>distorted,</b> the Ih symmetry is lowered to Th, and four boron-boron chemical bonds are formed between every two nearest neighbor B 80 cages. The cohesive energy of B 80 fcc solid is 0. 23 eV/atom with respect to the isolated B 80 fullerene. The calculated electronic structure reveals that the fcc B 80 solid is a metal. The predicted solid phase would constitute a form of pure boron and might have diverse implications. In addition, a simple electron counting rule is proposed, which could explain the stability of B 80 fullerene and the recently predicted stable boron sheet. Comment: 5 pages, 4 figure...|$|R

In this paper, we propose a method to objectively assess the perceptual quality of <b>geometrically</b> <b>distorted</b> images, based on image features processed by human vision. The proposed approach is a full-reference image quality metric focusing on the problem of local geometric distortions and is based on the use of Gabor filters that have received considerable attention because the characteristics of certain cells in the visual cortex of some mammals can be approximated by these filters. The novelty of the proposed technique is that it considers both the displacement field describing the distortion and the structure of the image. The experimental results show the good performances of the proposed metric...|$|R

The information should be robust against geometric distortions since an image taken by a digital camera is usually <b>geometrically</b> <b>distorted.</b> In the proposed method, a character pattern is designed in two colors so that the information is embedded as the area ratio of regions of two colors. Since the area ratio is affine invariant, it is expected that the area ratio is correctly extracted even if a character image is affine-transformed. We generate character patterns with the embedded information and discuss the effectiveness of the proposed method. 1...|$|R

Phys. Chem. B, 2000, 104, 2630 - 2641), could arise from symmetric metal cores perturbed by a dissymmetric or chiral field originating from the adsorbates. This finding implies that the electronic states of the nanocluster core are chiral, yet the lattice geometries of these cores need not be <b>geometrically</b> <b>distorted</b> by the chiral adsorbates. Based on simple chiral monolayer protected cluster models, we rationalize how the adsorption pattern of the tethering sulfur atoms has a substantial effect on the induced CD in the NIR spectral region, and we show how the chiral image charge produced in the core provides a convenient means of visualizing dissymmetric perturbations to the achiral gold nanocluster core. © the Owner Societies 2006...|$|R

40|$|Inversion {{dramatically}} impairs face perception, recognition, and discrimination. Yet it {{does not}} interfere with the ability to make precise estimates of facial feature distances. To investigate this discontinuity between facial feature distance estimation and general perception and recognition, we assessed the effect of inversion on the discrimination of differences in facial compression and elongation or expansion using <b>geometrically</b> <b>distorted</b> faces. The results clearly showed that geometrical face discrimination is not subject to the traditional face inversion effect and did not show a benefit for natural faces. Although discrimination thresholds were not affected by inversion, response times to the distance judgments were faster with inversion, especially when the inverted faces contained natural configurations. Based on these counterintuitive results, we suggest that participants used analytical processing to do the discrimination task. Moreover, we suggest that the depth with which a face is holistically encoded depends {{on the nature of the}} task, face orientation, and similarity between a face and the prototypical face template...|$|R

We examine the effectiveness of our rectification scheme by coupling it with the the Kinect Fusion algorithm. By comparing Kinect Fusion models obtained from raw sensor scans and from rectified scans, we demonstrate improvement for three classes of sensor motion: panning motions causes slant distortions, and tilt motions cause vertically elongated or compressed objects. For wobble we also observe a loss of detail, compared to the reconstruction using rectified depth scans. As our method relies on gyroscope readings, the amount of computations required is negligible compared {{to the cost of}} running Kinect Fusion. Embodied Visual Object Recognitio...|$|R

The detection first starts by decompressing the JPEG stego image, <b>geometrically</b> <b>distorting</b> it (e. g., by cropping), and recompressing. Because the geometrical distortion breaks the quantized structure of DCT coefficients during recompression, the distorted/recompressed image will have many macroscopic statistics approximately equal {{to those of the}} cover image.
