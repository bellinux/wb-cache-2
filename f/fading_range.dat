30|$|In modern {{wireless}} communication networks such as 3 G long-term evolution and WiMAX, modulation and coding are {{adapted to the}} fading condition of the channel, typically to the received signal-to-noise ratio (SNR) fed back to the base station by the subscriber station. This adaptive modulation and coding (AMC) scheme is usually designed to maximize the system average spectral efficiency over the whole <b>fading</b> <b>range</b> while maintaining a fixed given target bit error rate (BER). Adaptive transmission is usually performed by adjusting the transmit power level, the modulation level, the coding rate, {{or a combination of}} these parameters, in order to maintain a constant ratio of bit energy-to-additive white Gaussian noise (Eb/N 0). For a given target BER, the system can achieve high average spectral efficiency by transmitting at high rates for high channel SNR and at lower rates for poorer channel SNR.|$|E
40|$|Battery wear in plug-in {{electric}} vehicles (PEVs) {{is a complex}} function of ambient temperature, battery size, and disparate usage. Simulations capturing varying ambient temperature profiles, battery sizes, and driving patterns are of great value to battery and vehicle manufacturers. A predictive battery wear model developed by the National Renewable Energy Laboratory captures the effects of multiple cycling and storage conditions in a representative lithium chemistry. The sensitivity of battery wear rates to ambient conditions, maximum allowable depth-of-discharge, and vehicle miles travelled is explored for two midsize vehicles: a battery electric vehicle (BEV) with a nominal range of 75 mi (121 km) and a {{plug-in hybrid electric vehicle}} (PHEV) with a nominal charge-depleting range of 40 mi (64 km). Driving distance distributions represent the variability of vehicle use, both vehicle-to-vehicle and day-to-day. Battery wear over an 8 -year period was dominated by ambient conditions for the BEV with capacity <b>fade</b> <b>ranging</b> from 19 % to 32 % while the PHEV was most sensitive to maximum allowable depth-of-discharge with capacity <b>fade</b> <b>ranging</b> from 16 % to 24 %.

The extent of capacity <b>fading,</b> <b>ranging</b> from 5 to 30 % in 1000 cycles, increases with current-rate, and is markedly reduced with increasing binder content. Two fading mechanisms have been identified. With low binder content, and at high current-rate, capacity fading occurs in conjunction with appreciable increase in transmission resistance, suggesting progressively deteriorating electric contacts among the pseudocapacitive oxide particles and conductive carbon. The mechanical failure of the electrode structure may arise from the cyclic volumetric variation of the pseudocapacitive oxide particles as previously reported. With high binder content or at low current-rate, capacity fading is associated with increasing interfacial charge-transfer resistance upon cycling, which has a less pronounced effect than the mechanical failure mechanism...|$|R

30|$|Furthermore, {{the use of}} {{optimized}} convergence parameters such as step {{sizes and}} forgetting factors into conventional adaptive algorithms extend their <b>fading</b> <b>range</b> and lead to improved convergence and tracking performance [8, 12 – 18]. However, the stability of adaptive step-sizes and forgetting factors can be a concern unless they are constrained to lie within a predefined region [19]. Other alternative schemes include those based on processing the received data in subblocks [20 – 22] and subspace algorithms [23 – 28]. In addition, the fundamental problem of obtaining the unfaded symbols whilst suppressing MUI remains. Consequently, the application of such algorithms is restricted to low and moderate fading rates. The limitations of conventional estimation approaches {{led to the development}} of methods that attempt to track the faded symbol, such as the channel-compensated MMSE solution [29, 30]. This removes the burden of fading coefficient estimation from the receive filter. However, a secondary process is required to perform explicit estimation of the fading coefficients in order to perform symbol estimation [31].|$|E

Two branches (N= 2) diversity systems that are used for pre-detection combining have been investigated and computed. The statistics of {{carrier to noise ratio}} (CNR) and carrier to interference ratio (CIR) without diversity assuming Rayleigh fading model have been examined and then measured for diversity systems. The probability of error (p_e) vs CNR and (p_e) versus CIR have also been obtained. The <b>fading</b> dynamic <b>range</b> of the instantaneous CNR and CIR is reduced remarkably when diversity systems are used [1]. For a certain average probability of error, a higher valued average CNR and CIR is in need for non-diversity systems [1]. But a smaller valued of CNR and CIR are compared to diversity systems. The overall conclusion is that maximal-ratio combining (MRC) achieves the best performance improvement compared to other combining methods.

Our work generalizes existing channel estimators to the full dimensions including transmit spatial, receive spatial, time, and frequency. This allows versatile applications of our STF channel estimator to any <b>fading</b> environment, <b>ranging</b> from spatially-uncorrelated slow-varying frequency-flat channels to spatially-correlated fast-varying frequency-selective channels. The proposed STF channel estimator reduces to a time-frequency (TF) channel estimator when no spatial correlations exist.

Computer simulations were performed to study the mean-square-error (MSE) behavior with different pilot parameters. We then evaluate the suitability of our STF channel estimator on a space-frequency block coded OFDM system. Bit error rate (BER) performance degradation, with respect to perfect coherent detection, is limited to less than 2 dB at a BER of 10 - 5 in the modified 3 GPP fast-fading suburban macro environment.

40|$|One of the {{criteria}} defining {{the quality of a}} communications system is the probability of the system being unavailable for a given time period. It is therefore useful to determine not only the annual statistics of signal attenuation due to rain, but also the statistics of the rain fade durations. The huge ACTS database provides a unique opportunity to study the conditional statistics of the duration of fades exceeding different thresholds. Earlier studies at 12 GHz found that a double-exponential model of the conditional probability of fade duration gave excellent agreement with measured values, over <b>fade</b> durations <b>ranging</b> from two seconds to more than one hour, indicating that two distinct rain processes are involved. Analysis of the ACTS radiometer data at 20 and 27 GHz suggests that the distributions at these higher frequencies can usually be decomposed into three, and sometimes four, separate exponential distributions, with decay constants ranging from the order of hours to the order of seconds. The three longest times are tentatively associated with attenuation due to atmospheric gases and cloud, with stratiform rain, and with convective rain. It is also suggested that the shortest decay times may be associated with the antenna wetting problem experienced by the ACTS terminals. 1...|$|R

40|$|Abstract—Multicarrier code-division {{multiple}} access (MC-CDMA) combines multicarrier transmission with direct sequence spread spectrum. Recently, different approaches {{have been adopted}} which do not assume a perfectly known channel. In this paper, we examine the forward-link performance of decision-directed adaptive detection schemes, with and without explicit channel estimation, for MC-CDMA systems operating in fast fading channels. We analyze theoretically the impact of channel estimation errors by first considering a simpler system employing a threshold orthogonality restoring combining (TORC) detector with a Kalman channel estimator. We show that the performance deteriorates significantly as the channel fading rate increases and that the fading rate affects the selection of system parameters. We examine the performance of more realistic schemes based on the {{minimum mean square error}} (MMSE) criterion using least mean square (LMS) and recursive least square (RLS) adaptation. We present a discussion which compares the decision-directed and pilot-aided approaches and explores the tradeoffs between channel estimation overhead and performance. We find that there is a <b>fading</b> rate <b>range</b> where each method provides a good tradeoff between performance and overhead. We conclude that the MMSE per carrier decision-directed detector with RLS estimation combines good performance in low to moderate fading rates, robustness in parameter variations, and relatively low complexity and overhead. For higher fading rates, however, only pilot-symbol-aided detectors are appropriate.

The LRP is validated for standard stationary fading models, and tested with measured data and with data produced by our novel realistic physical channel model.

30|$|Among {{the variety}} of channel {{simulation}} models proposed in the literature, those based on Rice’s sum-of-sinusoids (SOS) principle [15, 16] have widely been in use {{as a basis for}} the design of multipath radio channel simulators (e.g., see [17 – 21]). In the conventional SOS channel simulation approach, it is assumed that the inphase and quadrature (IQ) components of the channel’s complex envelope are statistically independent Gaussian processes. Under this consideration, the simulation of the channel’s IQ components is carried out by means of two uncorrelated SOS processes having disjoint sets of parameters - gains, frequencies, phases, and number of sinusoids. This approach has been applied for over four decades to the simulation of a variety of mobile <b>fading</b> channels, <b>ranging</b> from simple single-input single-output (SISO) channels [18] to sophisticated multiple-input multiple-output (MIMO) channels [19]. It is important to notice that the conventional SOS simulation approach suffers from a serious limitation, that is, it can only be used to simulate fading channels characterized by symmetrical Doppler power spectral densities (DPSDs), leaving aside the more realistic case of channels having asymmetrical DPSDs.a A solution to overcome this limitation provides a variation of the conventional SOS approach, where a finite sum of complex sinusoids (cisoids) is used to simulate the channel’s complex envelope [22]. Basically, SOC models differ from conventional SOS models such that the IQ components of the former models are characterized by the same set of parameters [22]. This feature of SOC models enables the simulation of fading channels having symmetrical and asymmetrical DPSDs [23 – 26]. Another important feature of SOC models is that they have a clear physical meaning as they are related to the electromagnetic plane wave model [8, 27]. This is in contrast to the conventional SOS model, which cannot be interpreted physically.|$|R

40|$|A Late Ordovician benthic {{assemblage}} containing trilobites (Colpocoryphe, Onnia) and diploporid echinoderms (Aristocystites) taxa {{that are}} usually typical of open shelf environments is preserved in protected marine settings in {{the lower part of}} the Kermeur Formation (Armorican Massif, NW France). A fades analysis carried out on the Veryac'h section (Crozon Peninsula) allows identification of four sedimentary <b>fades</b> (SF), <b>ranging</b> from the bay/lagoon domain (SF 1 and SF 2) to the back-barrier (SF 3) and barrier (SF 4) domains. A benthic fauna comprising of trilobites, brachiopods and diploporids is found in the SF 1 and SF 2. In SF 1, fossils are randomly scattered in sediments (taphofacies 1, TF 1) showing two different preservation stages: TF 1 a with complete articulated skeletons and TF 1 b with disarticulated shells. These two preservation stages can be related either to the different modes of life of the taxa (i. e., recumbent, burrowing or nektobenthic) or to a composite assemblage with both autochthonous and allochthonous taxa. In this benthic assemblage, some trilobites and echinoderms taxa are mostly preserved either as complete exoskeletons and exuviae (Colpocoryphe grandis) or complete thecae (Aristocystites sp.), indicating an autochthonous origin. These taxa are usually found in low-energy open shelf settings. Their occurrence in a protected environment results from the combination of both allocyclic factors (i. e., change in sea level) and local conditions (i. e., shelf morphology, environmental conditions). Indeed, {{the lower part of the}} Kermeur Formation was deposited during a transgressive phase following a significant sea-level fall (Sandbian-Katian boundary). During the transgressive phase, barrier-lagoon systems were formed on the flat surface inherited from the sandbian shelf. Under non-restricted ecological conditions (i. e., normal oxygenation and salinity) in the protected settings, the new ecological niches were suitable for benthic organisms accustomed to open shelf environments. The settlement of these open shelf benthic species in coastal and protected environments may represent an offshore-onshore expansion, contrary to that described in the onshore-offshore diversification model of Phanerozoic shelf communities (Jablonski et al., 1983; Sepkoski, 1991).

The performance of Trellis Coded Modulation scheme via Expectation-Maximization algorithm utilizing a Kalman filter over multipath fading is presented. EM algorithm offers an easier computation than the classical ML estimation does. To get a better prediction of the communication performance, a fading channel model whose characteristics match with the real fading is implemented in the simulation. In the study a multipath fading channel model is considered. Multipath fading channel is applied to a communication system where the direct line-of-sight signal is blocked. A Trellis coding scheme is used to increase the system performance in this type of fading channel which is found to be a burst error channel and/or a random error channel. To further combat the burst error a block interleaver is incorporated in the system. Simulation results are presented for various normalized fading bandwidth which correspond normal vehicle speed at 2400 baud rate for an L-band carrier frequency. The gain between a receiver with perfect channel information and a receiver employing EM algorithm is 3 - 4 db for heavy and light <b>fading</b> over a <b>range</b> BTs of 0. 01 - 0. 1...|$|R
