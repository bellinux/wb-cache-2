50|$|<b>Glybuzole</b> is a {{hypoglycaemic}} {{medicine that}} is primarily {{used to treat}} diabetes mellitus type 2. <b>Glybuzole</b> and other sulphonylureas cannot be used to treat diabetes type 1, because they are ineffective if insulin production is inhibited, in such cases as diabetes type 1 and post-pancreatectomy.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glybuzole</b> is a {{hypoglycaemic}} medicine, mainly used {{to treat}} diabetes mellitus type 2. It is an oral antidiabetic drug (OAD), when administered in the right dose it will help bring the blood glycose level down by stimulating the insulin production. <b>Glybuzole</b> belongs to the sulphonylurea. Similar medicines are glimepiride, glipizide, glibenclamide, gliclazide, and gliquidone.|$|E

50|$|<b>Glybuzole</b> {{is a drug}} {{with low}} toxicity, it causes no irritation. Sometimes it results in dyspnoea, or {{shortness}} of breath, and it could result in hypoglycaemia.|$|E
50|$|There {{are some}} drugs that prolong {{the effects of}} drugs such as <b>glybuzole</b> and thereby {{increase}} the possibility of hypoglycaemia, these drugs include allopurinol, sulfonamides, acetylsalicylic acid and derivatives and fibrates.|$|E
50|$|<b>Glybuzole</b> has an anti-hyperglycaemic activity. <b>Glybuzole</b> is a sulphonylurea and can {{therefore}} lower the blood glucose levels. Sulphonylureas {{can bind to}} receptors at β-pancreatic cells which are specific for sulphonylurea binding. When a sulphonylurea binds to its receptor, the ATP-dependent channels for K+ ions will be blocked. Therefore, the flow of K+ ions into the β-pancreatic cell will stop and the cell membrane becomes depolarized. As a result, calcium ions will flow into the cell and that will then cause the contraction of actomyosin filaments which {{are responsible for the}} exocytosis of insulin. Finally, the increased secretion of insulin can then lead to a decrease in the blood glucose level.|$|E
50|$|The main {{side effects}} of <b>glybuzole</b> and other sulphonylureas are {{induction}} of hypoglycaemia, weight gain, abdominal upset, headache, and hypersensitivity reactions. Hypoglycaemia is mainly caused by excesses in insulin production due to doses that are too high, or due to the eating habits of the patient.|$|E
50|$|The {{molecular}} formula of <b>Glybuzole</b> is C12H15N3O2S2. It {{is also known}} as desaglybuzole or gludiase. The systematic name is N-(5-tert-Butyl-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)benzenesulfonamide.It consist of a benzene ring ring connected to sulfonamide. The nitrogen-atom of the sulfonamide is bound to a thiadiazole. In this thiadiazole two nitrogen-atoms and one sulphur-atom are present. The thiadiazole is bound to a tert-butyl group.|$|E
50|$|This {{method of}} synthesizing a sulfonamide {{is often used}} for the {{synthesis}} of glybuzole.Glybuzole can be synthesized using benzenesulfonyl chloride, 2-amino-5-tert-butyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole and pyridine. The reaction that will proceed is a bimolecular nucleophilic substitution reaction (SN2) (Figure 2). The nitrogen atom from the amino-group of 2-amino-5-tert-butyl-1,3,4-thiadiazole will attack the sulfur atom of benzene-sulfonyl chloride, leading to a chloride ion being removed from the benzenesulfonyl chloride. The intermediate which is now formed still has a positive charge. This positive charge is removed due to the uptake of a hydrogen atom by pyridine and the final product of interest, <b>glybuzole,</b> is produced.|$|E
