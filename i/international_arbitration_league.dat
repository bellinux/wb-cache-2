40|$|It is indisputable {{that the}} <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> world is an {{identifiable}} epistemic community that transcends national borders, and {{whose members are}} shaped by their own experience. Increasingly, that experience reflects an American influence, be it heritage, training, affiliation, or client base. In these remarks, Professor Alford addresses three {{issues related to the}} Americanization of <b>international</b> <b>arbitration.</b> The first is whether <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> has, in fact, only recently become Americanized. He posits instead that there is always an ebb and flow {{to the level of the}} United States 2 ̆ 7 involvement in <b>international</b> <b>arbitration.</b> During the drafting and signing of the 1958 New York Convention, for example, the United States was largely absent. However, in its earlier history the United States was highly involved in establishing pivotal <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> agreements, such as the Jay Treaty of 1794. Further ebb and flow of U. S. involvement is illustrated by the establishment of the Permanent Court of <b>Arbitration</b> and the <b>League</b> of Nations, as well as important arbitral doctrines as the Calvo Clause, international minimum standard, and the Hull formula. Second, he addresses whether <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> has become Americanized to the exclusion of other influences, disputing that theory by pointing out that developments in Asia (especially China), Latin America, and Europe have been highly influential in shaping the practice of <b>international</b> <b>arbitration.</b> Finally, he argues that U. S. influence in <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> is at the highest point it has ever reached, due to nine factors: (1) the rise of the Anglo-American law firm, (2) the increase of American legal training for non-U. S. lawyers, (3) the influence of the common-law adversarial model on arbitration style, (4) the increased acceptance of American discovery, (5) recent developments in choice of law issues, (6) the American influence of venue (situs of arbitration and situs for enforcement), (7) the American mechanism of published precedent, (8) the widespread adoption of English as the lingua franca of <b>international</b> <b>arbitration,</b> and (9) the over-representation of Americans are major arbitration institutions...|$|R

40|$|Wydanie publikacji dofinansowane przez Komitet Badań NaukowychThe article {{presents}} {{the ideas and}} political activities of William Randal Cremer: an English worker and trade-unionist. The development of his political career was connected with the political struggle to democratize the British Constitution and to achieve peaceful state of international ralations {{in the second half}} of the 19 th century. Cremer was one of the makers of the British trade-unionism in the 50 ’s of the century after the fall of the Chartist movement. He was in favour of solving the workers’ problems by means of trade-union’s peaceful mediation between the workers and their employers. In the 60 ’s Cremer and the British trade-unionism were engaged in the political action conducted by the Reform League (together with the radical wing of the Liberal Party) to introduce the next Reform Bill in the British Constitution and to create possibility for the British workers to sit in Parliament. At the same time Cremer participated in the formation and activity of the International Working Men’s Association but being a reformist he withdrew his support when the Association was taken over by revolutionary thinkers. Cremer didn’t also appreciate the political power of the working British mass risen in the 90 ’s: the new trade-unionism and the Independent Labour Party. For at reason when he had an occasion to sit in Parliament (thanks to the Reform Bill in 1885) as „Lib. -Lab. ” he became a representative of radical liberals but not socialists. He was not involved in any of the British workers’ problems at the time. Cremer in Parliament and also in the various peace organisations (e. g. <b>International</b> <b>Arbitration</b> <b>League),</b> however, paid a lot of attention to advance his belief that peace was only acceptable state for manking and arbitration the method by which it could be achieved in international relations. As a result of his peaceful activities he became a laureate of the Peace Noble Prize in 1903. The idea of arbitration proved to be very important Cremer’s contribution to the world peace movement despite many tragic was experiences in the 20 th century. Zadanie pt.

40|$|<b>International</b> <b>arbitration</b> has {{developed}} into a global system of adjudication, dealing with disputes arising {{from a variety of}} legal relationships: between states, between private commercial actors, and between private and public entities. It operates to a large extent according to its own rules and dynamics - a transnational justice system rather independent of domestic and international law. In response to its growing importance and use by disputing parties, <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> has become increasingly institutionalized, professionalized, and judicialized. At the same time, it has gained significance beyond specific disputes and indeed contributes to the shaping of law. Arbitrators have therefore become not only adjudicators, but transnational lawmakers. This has raised concerns over the legitimacy of <b>international</b> <b>arbitration.</b> Practising Virtue looks at <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> from the 'inside', with an emphasis on its transnational character. Instead of concentrating on the national and international law governing <b>international</b> <b>arbitration,</b> it focuses on those who practise <b>international</b> <b>arbitration,</b> in order to understand how it actually works, what its sources of authority are, and what demands of legitimacy it must meet. Putting those who practise arbitration into the centre of the system of <b>international</b> <b>arbitration</b> allows us to appreciate {{the way in which they}} contribute to the development of the law they apply. This book invites eminent arbitrators to reflect on the actual practice of <b>international</b> <b>arbitration,</b> and its contribution to the transnational justice system...|$|R
