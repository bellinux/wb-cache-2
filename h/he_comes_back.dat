5|$|Max Fenig (Scott Bellis), {{last seen}} in Fallen Angel, is {{traveling}} on an airplane, Flight 549, which flies over upstate New York. He watches another {{man on the}} plane {{who seems to be}} following him. The man heads to the plane's bathroom, where he assembles a zip gun. However, when <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> out, the airplane begins shaking and a bright light flashes outside, showing that the plane is encountering a UFO. The emergency door next to Max's seat is opened.|$|E
5|$|We played Birmingham City in {{pre-season}} {{and he got}} {{a lovely}} ovation from their supporters and it was the same at Yeovil last year. He got a lovely clap at Northampton a few weeks ago when he was taken off. I don't think that happened by coincidence. And I've got a feeling that if he leaves Cheltenham he will get a similar reception if <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> with another club. Supporters recognise him and they see the whole-heartedness and the commitment and the ability that he has got.|$|E
5|$|Half-demon Callie Maggotbone's demon father Aldermach is {{pressuring}} her {{to break}} up with her boyfriend Mark Lilly and marry Twayne Boneraper, to fulfill an ancient magical blood pact; Aldermach gets paid by Twayne's family to deliver him a bride, {{and if he does}} not, he will get murdered. Callie refuses to marry Twayne, and to prove that her relationship with Mark is serious, she invites him to move in with her, but does not tell him about her arranged marriage to Twayne. Meanwhile, Mark is having troubles at the Department of Integration; he receives rather negative feedback on his teacher evaluation forms from his students. Since the department cannot afford having individual sessions with students, he decides to hold them at his and his zombie roommate Randall's apartment. At his first session, Mark is kidnapped by Aldermach who bribes him {{to break up}} with Callie. Mark declines, and Callie's human mother Rosie shows up and argues with Aldermach, which gives Mark the idea to invite them both to therapy sessions. Following the session, Mark leaves the room for a short while, and when <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back,</b> Aldermach and Rosie are having sex and eventually get back together.|$|E

5|$|One day, {{however, the}} mirror tells her {{that there is}} a new fairest woman in the land, her 14-year-old stepdaughter, Princess Snow White. She became obsessively jealous of the princess' {{emerging}} beauty, therefore turning her into a scullery maid in her own home. After observing the handsome Prince from another kingdom singing a love song to Snow White, the proud Queen, in a jealous rage, commands her faithful Huntsman, Humbert, to take the princess deep into the forest and kill her. He is ordered to bring back her heart in a box to prove that he had done so. But Humbert cannot bear to kill the young princess upon realizing that she is impervious to harm, so he tells Snow White of the Queen's plot and tells her to run away and never to come back. To escape the penalty, <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> with a pig's heart and gives it to the Queen. When she questions her mirror, it again replies that Snow White is the fairest in the land, and that she is living at the cottage of the Seven Dwarfs, revealing that the box contains the heart of a pig. The Dwarfs are fearful of the Queen's black magic but decide to take in Snow White anyway.|$|E

25|$|The {{story of}} 'Zephyr et Flore' {{is set on}} Mount Olympus in Greece, where Boreas, the north wind, plots to abduct Flora, the wife of Zephyr, the west wind. Introducing a game of blind man's bluff, Boreas {{separates}} the couple and kills Zephyr with an arrow. He then takes Flora to his cave, where she faints from fright. Nine muses in mourning bring Zephyr's body to Mount Olympus where, after his funeral procession, <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> to life.

Due to the disease, Artemis finds himself obsessed with the number 5 and fearing the number 4 (which in Chinese sounds like the word for death). The disease worsens throughout the novel, leading to his distrust of close friends. A neutrino shock from Holly Short frees Artemis' alter-ego Orion but <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> after being knocked out by a buzz baton blow from Holly.

25|$|Among {{the plot}} twists are {{the death of}} {{apparently}} crucial characters and the reappearances of believed-to-be dead characters. However, Rachael Brown of The Atlantic said that Martin's penchant for unpredictability may make the reader grow increasingly skeptical of apparent deaths, alluding to Jon Snow's fate in A Dance with Dragons. Martin believes that bringing back a dead character necessitates a transformative experience of the character. The body may be moving, but {{some aspect of the}} spirit is changed or lost. One of the characters who has come back repeatedly from death is Beric Dondarrion, The Lightning Lord, and what has happened with him echoes with some of the other revived characters; bits of his humanity and his past lives are lost every time <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> from death, his flesh is falling away from him, but he remembers the mission he was sent to do before death.|$|E

The Huffington Posts Sarah Dean wrote that Timberlake used a tip from Thicke to accompany a [...] "great" [...] song with a video objectifying women who enjoy dancing nude, criticizing the use of three women for a song with lyrics about a single love interest. According to Tamar Anitai of MTV Buzzworthy, Timberlake wanted to live his life and celebrate his album's success: [...] "Oh, come on! Don't complain. You bitched and moaned endlessly when Justin Timberlake stopped making music for six years, so don't get all Veruca Salty when <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> with boobs to spare and boobs to share." ...|$|E

500|$|Critics {{were largely}} {{positive}} in their {{reviews of the}} episode. The Huffington Post Michael Pascua called [...] "Give Peace a Chance" [...] a [...] "hit and miss" [...] episode, criticizing the slang dialogue by saying it [...] "sounded like it came from an MTV drama", but praising the installment's [...] "character driven development". Pascua was positive {{on the development of}} Tahir's character, writing: [...] "I hope <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> in a later episode just to remind these people about patience and hope." [...] TV Fanatic Steve Marsi gave a positive review of the episode, saying it [...] "won [...] over", and also praising Tahir's character.

500|$|Edna asks [...] "Woodrow" [...] for a photograph, so Bart {{searches}} {{through a}} book called NHL Stars of 1969 and sends her a picture of ice hockey star Gordie Howe. Bart, as Woodrow, writes Edna other letters, using dialogue from old romance films {{to tell her what}} she wants to hear. He then sends a letter asking for them to meet at the Gilded Truffle restaurant. Bart sees Edna waiting for Woodrow, and laughs as he goes to watch a movie. When <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> and sees Edna still at the restaurant on the verge of tears, Bart is upset and guilty to see her crying. Meanwhile, Homer resists temptations to curse but nevertheless experiences intense feelings of rage. However, his constant swearing eventually puts enough money in the jar to purchase a dog house.|$|E
500|$|Another re-introduction {{involved}} the storyline surrounding the Siege of Riverrun, with actor Clive Russell {{returning to the}} show as Brynden [...] "the Blackfish" [...] Tully, who last appeared since the third-season episode [...] "The Rains of Castamere", in which the Red Wedding took place, and the Blackfish successfully evaded. In an interview with IGN, Clive Russell stated he was hopeful {{to return to the}} role saying [...] "I'd hoped that he'd come back because <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> in the books again. But they're not doing the books -- there is no book to do it from. I'd hoped that would happen. I don't think I was surprised it would happen because they bring back all kinds of people at all kinds of times. But it was good to go back there, I must say." ...|$|E

Meanwhile, during Hoffman's autopsy, Scully experiences a vision wherein <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> to life {{on the operating table}} and begins talking. Later, at the church, Scully sees a vision of Hoffman in Jesus' place on a large crucifix. Mulder arrests O'Fallon for Hoffman's murder, but Micah Hoffman walks in, unscathed. He tells the agent that while he initially created the forgeries to make money, he came to believe he was the reincarnation of Jesus Christ, and bombed the church {{to get rid of the}} [...] "blasphemous" [...] forgeries. Skinner suspends Scully and Mulder for four weeks because of the mix-up. Sixteen months later, O'Fallon kills Micah Hoffman in a murder-suicide. As such, the X-File is never truly solved.|$|E
500|$|Serbian writer Janko Veselinović {{was well}} acquainted with the {{folklore}} of Tamnava, where {{he worked as a}} teacher in a village. In his short story published in 1888, an elderly woman talks to him about various supernatural beings, including her co-villager Petar, a vetrenjak: [...] "As soon as he perceives a greyish cloud and hears thunder, Petar leaves whatever he may be doing, and goes somewhere. He runs so fast that no biped can overtake him. After he passes the cloud, <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> naked and blue as indigo. Then he has to stay in bed for a week. And do you know why he is like that? He told me. The pogibaoci [...] from surrounding villages drive the clouds toward our village, and Petar will not let hail beat us. He fights with them until he will overpower them, or they him... 'We uproot oaks, as one would pull onion bulbs from the ground, and beat each other with them.'" ...|$|E
500|$|... "Towards {{the end of}} last season, where I {{said the}} best is yet to come, I {{strongly}} felt that way because towards {{the end of last}} season we closed out the season strong. I knew that was a catalyst to really turn up the team, to get a little bit more out of everyone. Denny goes down with his knee injury. <b>He</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back,</b> obviously not 100 percent. The team steps up. We narrow the gap to try to pick him up knowing he's not going to be there, and we start winning races, even with a driver that is not 100 percent. Now that he's coming back healthier each week, we're winning more and more. I simply think that's the catalyst for us to move forward. It's easier when the morale is high to get a little bit more out of your guys. Our benchmark is ourselves and we're just trying to work on that." ...|$|E

500|$|In {{parallel}} storylines, Toby has {{a meeting}} with union leaders concerned about cheap imports from China – in particular bras. Imposing trade restrictions, however, could be damaging to the US auto industry. Josh has {{a meeting with}} the Base Closing Commission. Deciding which military bases to keep and which to shut down is not only politically hazardous, but a job he finds extremely boring. Leaving the room, <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> to find his intern Ryan in the act of pulling a confidence trick to get a power Congressman's favor regarding a base in his district, without his approval. He tells Ryan to clean out his desk but the intern seems to think Josh is kidding in order to throw the Congressman off the track of their [...] "secret plan". When the democratic Mayor of D.C.

500|$|Woodroof begins {{selling the}} {{drugs on the}} street and at gay nightclubs. <b>He</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> into contact with Rayon, with whom he reluctantly sets up {{business}} since she can bring many more clients. The pair establish the [...] "Dallas Buyers Club", charging $400 per month for membership, and it becomes extremely popular. He gradually begins to respect Rayon and think of her as a friend. When Woodroof has a heart attack caused by a recently acquired dose of interferon, Dr. Sevard learns of the club and the alternative medication. He is angry that it is interrupting his trial, while Richard Barkley of the FDA confiscates the interferon and threatens to have Woodroof arrested. Dr. Saks agrees that there are benefits to AIDS medicine buyers clubs (of which there are several around the country) but feels powerless to change anything. The processes that the FDA uses to research, test and approve drugs is seen as flawed and a part of the problem for AIDS patients. Dr. Saks and Woodroof strike up a friendship.|$|E
500|$|On 25 July 2014, Chelsea {{announced}} on their official website that Drogba completed {{his return to}} the club on a free transfer, and signed a one-year contract.

Everyone knows the special relationship I have with this club and it has always felt like home to me." [...] Mourinho also commented on the transfer, saying: [...] "He's coming because he's one of the best strikers in Europe. I know his personality very well and I know if <b>he</b> <b>comes</b> <b>back</b> he's not protected by history or what he's done for this club previously. He is coming with the mentality to make more history." [...] On 28 July 2014, Chelsea announced that Drogba would wear the number 15 shirt which he wore when he first signed for the club in 2004. Mohamed Salah, who wore the number during the 2013–14 season, took over the number 17 shirt vacated by Eden Hazard. On 15 August, however, it was announced that Drogba had been given back the number 11 shirt he previously wore at the club, with its previous occupant Oscar taking over the number 8 jersey vacated by Frank Lampard.|$|E
