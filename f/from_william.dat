Additionally, several similarities have been drawn between Simba and Prince Hamlet <b>from</b> <b>William</b> Shakespeare's tragedy of the same name.

5|$|Some of the {{earliest}} evidence of a revival in Gothic architecture is from Scotland. Inveraray Castle, constructed from 1746 with design input <b>from</b> <b>William</b> Adam, displays the incorporation of turrets. These were largely conventional Palladian style houses that incorporated some external features of the Scots Baronial style.|$|E
5|$|The first {{recorded}} writing mentioning this site is <b>from</b> <b>William</b> Worcester in about 1480 when {{he referred to}} it as Myghell-borough. A medieval church dedicated to St Michael, belonging to the Athelney Abbey, dates from at least the mid-15th century. This formed a sanctuary for royalist troops in 1642 and 1645 during the English Civil War, and a detachment of the king's army occupied it in 1685 {{during the course of the}} Monmouth Rebellion.|$|E
5|$|After King Richard {{went to the}} Holy Land on the Third Crusade, Nonant {{supported}} the efforts of Prince John, King Richard's brother, to seize power in England. Nonant joined with John in trying to wrest control of the castles of Tickhill and Nottingham <b>from</b> <b>William</b> Longchamp, the Bishop of Ely, who had been named justiciar and chancellor during Richard's absence. It was probably Nonant that {{was responsible for the}} meeting at Loddon Bridge on 5 October 1191 that ended in the deposition of Longchamp from office. Nonant supported John's side throughout the time that Richard was on Crusade and in captivity, and was tried with John after Richard's return to England in 1194. Nonant was only restored to royal favour in 1195 after the payment of a fine of 5000 marks. The bishop lost his three sheriffdoms, and retired to Normandy.|$|E

5|$|Although he {{had given}} {{sanctuary}} to Tostig Godwinson when the Northumbrians drove him out, Malcolm was not {{directly involved in the}} ill-fated invasion of England by Harald Hardraade and Tostig in 1066, which ended in defeat and death at the battle of Stamford Bridge. In 1068, he granted asylum to a group of English exiles fleeing <b>from</b> <b>William</b> of Normandy, among them Agatha, widow of Edward the Confessor's nephew Edward the Exile, and her children: Edgar Ætheling and his sisters Margaret and Cristina. They were accompanied by Gospatric, Earl of Northumbria. The exiles were disappointed, however, if they had expected immediate assistance from the Scots.|$|E
5|$|Although {{the first}} two Uranian moons were {{discovered}} in 1787, they were not named until 1852, a year after two more moons had been discovered. The responsibility for naming was taken by John Herschel, son of the discoverer of Uranus. Herschel, instead of assigning names from Greek mythology, named the moons after magical spirits in English literature: the fairies Oberon and Titania <b>from</b> <b>William</b> Shakespeare's A Midsummer Night's Dream, and the sylphs Ariel and Umbriel from Alexander Pope's The Rape of the Lock (Ariel is also a sprite in Shakespeare's The Tempest). The reasoning was presumably that Uranus, as god {{of the sky and}} air, would be attended by spirits of the air.|$|E
5|$|Beginning in 1932, Mary J. L. McDonald {{made the}} then-largest {{donation}} of books {{to the library}} when she donated volumes worth just over $10,000.

In 1936, the Works Progress Administration gave a decorative archway to the library to be installed over the south entrance to the building. The library was among several buildings vandalized by University of Oregon students in October 1945 during {{the run-up to the}} Civil War football game between the two schools. The library received a bequest of about 5,500 volumes valued at about $15,000 in December 1947 <b>from</b> <b>William</b> H. Galvani's estate. This donation overtook that of McDonald to become the largest received by the library up to that time.|$|E
