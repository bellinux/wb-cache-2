5|$|Cheney's {{record as}} CEO {{was subject to}} some dispute among Wall Street analysts.

Although Cheney is not named as an individual defendant in the suit, Halliburton shareholders are pursuing a class-action lawsuit alleging that the corporation artificially inflated <b>its</b> <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> during this period. In June 2011, the United States Supreme Court reversed a lower court ruling and allowed the case to continue in litigation.

25|$|Investors in Nintendo {{have been}} more {{cautious}} about the Switch, leading to a significant drop in <b>its</b> <b>stock</b> <b>price,</b> which had otherwise been trading at their highest values over the previous five years. The company's stock price, which rose by 4% {{on the day before}} the Switch's October 2016 announcement in anticipation, fell by 7% the next day. Analysts attribute the drop to the lack of surprise of the announcement given the prior year of product teases and information, giving investors no catalyst to invest further. Following the technical presentation of the Switch in January 2017, Nintendo's stock price fell by more than 5% the following day, with one analyst stating that the markets were concerned if the Switch would attract new gamers outside of the core Nintendo fan group. Nintendo's stock value continued to drop, and by early February 2017, had fallen below the September 2016 price.

40|$|The {{impact of}} an {{announcement}} of Earnings per Share (EPS) on <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> had often been {{the centre of}} interest to researchers, shareholders and investors. This is because; EPS {{is one of the}} investment tools to evaluate a company’s performance either in the short or long term. The estimated earnings can be used to measure the financial health and prospect of a company. Therefore, in this research paper, an investigation and evaluation has been performed to indicate the impact of EPS on the <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> of Public Bank Berhad, a listed bank in Malaysia. The aim {{of the study was to}} investigate whether there is any correlation between Public Bank Berhad’s EPS and it a <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> for a relatively long time period of 19 years. In addition, a statistical study was conducted, using Statistical Package for Social Sciences (SPSS) software to evaluate if there is a significant level of impact on the bank’s EPS on <b>its</b> <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> during the quarterly earnings announced since, year 2000. Although, there are some limitations in the use of EPS as an investment analysis tool, it can be concluded that EPS is a classical model, which is important and relied upon by investment analysts to measure the performance of business entities. In this research finding, it can be concluded that there is a very strong positive correlation between Public Bank Berhad’s EPS on it <b>stock</b> <b>prices</b> and that there is a significant impact of earnings announcement on Public Bank Berhad’s <b>stock</b> <b>prices...</b>|$|R
25|$|The {{benefits}} Mitsubishi {{had seen}} {{because of its}} strong presence in south-east Asia reversed themselves {{as a result of}} the economic crisis in the region which began in 1991 with the advent of the collapse of the Japanese asset price bubble, referred to in Japan as the beginning of the Lost Decade and continued to 1997. The collapse was partly the result of the Plaza Accord agreement in 1985, which sought to equalize the United States dollar with the Japanese yen and the German mark. In September of that year the company closed its Thai factory in response to a crash in the country's currency and plummeting consumer demand. The large truck plant, which had produced 8,700 trucks in 1996, was shut down indefinitely. In addition, Mitsubishi had little support from sales in Japan, which slowed considerably throughout 1997 and were affected by that country's own economic uncertainty into 1998. Other Japanese automakers, such as Toyota and Honda, bolstered their own slipping domestic sales with success in the U.S. However, with a comparatively small percentage of the American market, the impact of the turmoil in the Asian economy had a greater effect on Mitsubishi, and the company's 1997 losses were the worst in its history. In addition, it lost both its rank as the third largest automaker in Japan to Mazda, and market share overseas. <b>Its</b> <b>stock</b> <b>price</b> fell precipitously, prompting the company to cancel its year-end dividend payment.|$|E

40|$|We {{document}} {{a significantly}} negative {{effect of the}} change in a firm’s leverage ratio on <b>its</b> <b>stock</b> <b>prices.</b> This effect cannot be explained by popular asset pricing factors or firm characteristics. We find that the negative effect is stronger for firms with limited debt capacity. Moreover, firms with an increase in leverage ratio tend to have less future investment, even after controlling for growth option and target leverage. These findings are consistent with a dynamic view of the pecking-order theory that an increase in leverage reduces firms’ safe debt capacity and may lead to future underinvestment, thus reducing firm value. This effect of debt capacity is not subsumed by the default risk, since the return pattern also exists among financially healthy firms and portfolios sorted by change in leverage ratio show no obvious pattern in future expected returns after the immediate price change. Additional tests show that the price effect cannot be fully explained by the tradeoff or the market timing theories...|$|R
