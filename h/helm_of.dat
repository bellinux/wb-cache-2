5|$|Campbell died in 1971 {{at the age}} of 61 in Mountainside, New Jersey. At {{the time}} of his sudden death after 34 years at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> Analog, Campbell's quirky {{personality}} and eccentric editorial demands had alienated a number of his most illustrious writers {{to the point that they}} no longer submitted works to him.|$|E
5|$|If Wilde's {{period at}} the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the {{magazine}} was a mixed success from an organizational point of view, one can also argue that it {{played a pivotal role}} in his development as a writer and facilitated his ascent to fame. Whilst Wilde the journalist supplied articles under the guidance of his editors, Wilde the editor is forced to learn to manipulate the literary marketplace on his own terms.|$|E

5|$|David Benioff {{was hired}} to write the {{screenplay}} for the spin-off film Wolverine in October 2004. Hugh Jackman became producer as well as star and worked with Benioff on the script. Ratner was negotiated by the studio to take the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> Wolverine after directing X-Men: The Last Stand, but no agreement was made. In July 2007, Gavin Hood was hired as director.

5|$|During the 1950s, Tung was a {{high-ranking}} official in Nhu's Cần Lao, a secret political apparatus which maintained the Ngô family's grip on power, extorting money from wealthy businessmen. In 1960, Tung was promoted {{directly to the}} rank of colonel and became the commander of the special forces. His period at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> South Vietnam's elite troops was noted mostly for his work in repressing dissidents, rather than fighting the Viet Cong insurgents. His best-known attack was the raid on Xá Lợi pagoda on 21 August 1963, in which hundreds died or disappeared.|$|E

5|$|Hector Macdonald Laws (Hec) Waller, DSO and Bar (4 April 1900– 1 March 1942) was {{a senior}} officer in the Royal Australian Navy (RAN). His career spanned almost thirty years, {{including}} service in both world wars. At the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> HMAS Stuart in the Mediterranean from 1939 to 1941, he won recognition as a skilful ship's captain and flotilla commander. He then transferred to the South West Pacific as captain of the light cruiser HMAS Perth, and went down with his ship against heavy odds during the Battle of Sunda Strait in early 1942.|$|E
5|$|In 2000, McMullen {{sold the}} team to Puck Holdings, an {{affiliate}} of YankeeNets, for $176million. The owners wanted to program Devils games on what eventually became the YES Network and move {{the team to}} a new arena in Newark. Neither of these proposals became reality under Puck Holdings' ownership. For {{the start of the}} next season, Lamoriello was appointed CEO of both the Devils and the New Jersey Nets National Basketball Association team. He remained at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the basketball team until it was sold with the intention of moving it to Brooklyn in 2004.|$|E
5|$|In September 2000, Warner Bros. and {{producer}} Lauren Shuler Donner hired writer-director Hype Williams {{to take the}} <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the project. In October 2001, the studio hired screenwriters Christian Gudegast and Paul Scheuring for $1.2 million split between them to write a script for the film. Eventually, without production getting under way, the director and the writers left the project. In June 2004, Vince Vaughn spearheaded {{a revival of the}} project by presenting a take for the film that would develop the characters more strongly. Vaughn was cast as Racer X and was also attached to the project as an executive producer. With production never becoming active, Vaughn was eventually detached from the project.|$|E

5|$|Later {{the same}} month, Barcelona won the UEFA Super Cup after {{defeating}} Porto 2–0 thanks to goals from Lionel Messi and Cesc Fàbregas. This extended the club's overall number of official trophies to 74, surpassing Real Madrid's {{total amount of}} official trophies. The Super Cup victory also marked another impressive achievement as Pep Guardiola won his 12th trophy out of 15 possible in only three years at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the club, becoming the all-time record holder of most titles won as a coach at Barcelona.|$|E
5|$|Marcello Lippi {{took over}} as Juventus manager {{at the start of}} the 1994–95 campaign. His first season at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the club was a {{successful}} one, as Juventus recorded their first Serie A championship title since the mid-1980s, as well as the Coppa Italia. The crop of players during this period featured Ciro Ferrara, Roberto Baggio, Gianluca Vialli and a young Alessandro Del Piero. Lippi led Juventus to their first Supercoppa Italiana and the Champions League the following season, beating Ajax on penalties after a 1–1 draw in which Fabrizio Ravanelli scored for Juventus.|$|E
5|$|The Crimson Tide {{scored on}} its next two {{possessions}} as well, and McCarron completed touchdown passes to running backs Kenyan Drake and Jalston Fowler. With the lead at 35–0 {{late in the}} second quarter, Alabama played its reserves {{for much of the}} remainder of the game. After the Crimson Tide defense forced another punt from the Panthers, McCarron was replaced by backup quarterback Blake Sims. On his first possession at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> Alabama's offense, Sims led the team to the Georgia State one-yard line, but a pair of false starts forced Alabama to settle for a field goal that increased the lead to 38–0 at halftime.|$|E

50|$|Bumpers opposed {{constitutional}} amendments throughout his Senate tenure and {{was critical of}} his Republican colleague, Jesse <b>Helms</b> <b>of</b> North Carolina for attempting that route to enact conservative policy proposals.

5|$|Tommy Amaker {{inherited}} {{a team that}} imposed sanctions on itself after {{his first year at}} the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the program. Nonetheless, he coached the team to the postseason three times including both an NIT championship in 2004 and a runner-up finish in 2006. During the 2005–06, when the team compiled a 22–11 overall (8–8, Big Ten) record, he led them to their first national ranking in eight years when they reached the #20 position. Despite his successes, the team never won a Big Ten Championship and never made the NCAA tournament, which led to his firing after six seasons.|$|E
5|$|Although Blažević {{continued}} his tenure {{in spite of}} failure to qualify for Euro 2000, he resigned in October 2000 following draws against Belgium and Scotland {{in the first two}} games of the 2002 World Cup qualifiers. His successor at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the national team was Mirko Jozić, who previously led the Yugoslavia under-20 team to a World Cup triumph in 1987. Despite the retirement of many Golden Generation players, Croatia went unbeaten during the rest of the qualifiers. They opened their 2002 World Cup campaign with a narrow loss to Mexico before producing a surprise 2–1 victory over Euro 2000 finalists Italy in the next fixture, giving life to hopes of passing through to the knockout stage. However, they lost their final group fixture to Ecuador and were eliminated. Jozić then resigned, and was replaced in July 2002 by Croatian-Austrian Otto Barić, the team's first manager born outside the Balkans.|$|E
5|$|Beadles {{left the}} club in April 1929 due to a {{persistent}} knee injury, scoring a hat-trick in his final ever game in the Football League, a 6–2 victory over Hartlepool United on 27 April 1929. During his time with Southport, Beadles scored 61 goals in 92 league matches. Following his departure from Southport, he was appointed player-coach at Irish side Dundalk, making his debut on 25 August 1929 in a match against Shamrock Rovers. In his one season at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the club, he {{led them to the}} semi-final of the FAI Cup, losing 2–1 to Brideville, a sixth-placed finish in the League of Ireland and handed first-team opportunities to Joey Donnelly and Tommy Godwin. However, he retired from football {{at the end of the}} season after persistent injuries and his family being unable to settle in Ireland.|$|E

5|$|Despite his successes, al-Mu'tadid's reign was {{ultimately}} {{too short to}} effect a lasting reversal of the Caliphate's fortunes, and the revival that he spearheaded was too dependent {{on the presence of}} capable personalities at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> the state. The brief reign of his less able son and heir, al-Muktafi, still saw some major gains, notably the annexation of the Tulunid domains, but his later successors lacked his energy, and new enemies appeared {{in the form of the}} Qarmatians. In addition, the factionalism within the bureaucracy, that had become apparent during the later years of al-Mu'tadid's reign, would debilitate the Abbasid government for decades to come, eventually leading to the subjugation of the Caliphate to a series of military strongmen and culminating in the conquest of Baghdad by the Buyids in 946.|$|E
5|$|In 1987, Stein {{coached the}} Rockledge High School {{baseball}} team, leading them a district title with a 17–11 record. Stein {{was hired as}} {{the manager of the}} Class A-Short Season Little Falls Mets of the New York–Penn League in 1988. Little Falls were minor league affiliates of the New York Mets. In his first professional season as a manager, Stein led Little Falls to a 39–36 record. Stein commented that when he became a manager it was difficult to learn pitching after all the years of being a position player. In 1989, the New York Mets fired Butch Hobson, the manager of the Class-A Columbia Mets, and promoted Stein to that position. At the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> Colombia that year, Stein led them to a 73–67 record. He also served as a player-coach with the Orlando Juice of the Senior Professional Baseball Association in 1989.|$|E
5|$|In {{the wake}} of the British victory at Second Battle of El Alamein in November 1942, and other {{military}} reverses, the Propaganda Ministry directed the media to emphasise Rommel's invincibility. The charade was maintained until the spring of 1943, even as the German situation in Africa became increasingly precarious. In May 1943, to ensure that the inevitable defeat in Africa would not be associated with Rommel's name, Goebbels had the Supreme High Command announce that Rommel was on a two-month leave for health reasons. Instead, the campaign was presented by Berndt, who resumed his role in the Propaganda Ministry, as a ruse to tie down the British Empire while Germany was turning Europe into an impenetrable fortress, with Rommel at the <b>helm</b> <b>of</b> this success. After the radio program ran in May 1943, Rommel sent Berndt a case of cigars as a sign of his gratitude.|$|E
