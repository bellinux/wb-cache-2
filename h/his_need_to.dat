Bakshi began to see Rasinski as a father figure; Rasinski, childless, was happy to serve as Bakshi's mentor.|$|E

5|$|A primary {{pipeline}} {{was laid}} between Portland and a neighboring town during 1889. Haynes oversaw {{construction of the}} ten-mile (16km) long pipeline {{and the creation of}} the wells for pumping the gas. During his numerous buggy rides between the two towns, he first began to conceive of a novel form of motorized transportation. His thoughts on the topic were spurred by <b>his</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> regularly change horses because of their inability to endure the long distances and sandy roads he frequently traveled. He theorized that a motorized vehicle would be more economical than horse-and-buggy transportation, and could potentially move at a faster rate of speed.|$|E

25|$|Kỳ {{then decided}} to allow Thi to return to Da Nang, the largest city {{in the region and}} the second largest in the country on March 16, ostensibly to restore order.

25|$|In {{terms of}} White's style it is {{important}} note that while he spent almost {{all of his life}} from 1906 to 1925 living in New York City, there is nothing in his photographs to indicate he ever lived there. There were no streets scenes or people in the city, no buildings, bridges, ships or automobiles. Unlike most of his photographer friends, he chose to ignore the very place he lived except for the access it gave him to promote his work and to teach others. Although he was pragmatic in <b>his</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> earn a living and advance his art, he remained true to his small town roots throughout his life.|$|E

25|$|De Valera’s {{preoccupation with}} {{his part in}} history, and <b>his</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> explain and justify it, are {{reflected}} in innumerable ways. His faith in historians as trustworthy guardians of his reputation was not absolute. He made many attempts to influence their views and to adjust and refine the historical record whenever he felt this portrayed him, his allies or his cause inaccurately or unfavourably to his mind, these could often mean the same thing. He extended these endeavours to encompass the larger Irish public. An important function of his newspaper group, the Irish Press group, was to rectify {{what he saw as}} the errors and omissions of a decade in which he had been the subject of largely hostile commentary.|$|E
25|$|Some of Ron's qualities {{serve as}} foils to Harry. While Harry is an orphan with more gold than he needs, Ron {{comes from a}} loving but poor family; many of his {{possessions}} are hand-me-downs.

Finally, Ron is the most mediocre of his siblings, being (as of the first book) neither an excellent Quidditch player, a noteworthy student, nor the daughter his mother always wanted. All of these factors combined cause Ron to feel insecure; Ron's inferiority complex and <b>his</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> prove himself, is {{the main thrust of}} his character arc.|$|E
25|$|It was in Mexico that Nancarrow did {{the work}} {{for which he is}} best known today. He had already written some music in the United States, but the extreme {{technical}} demands of his compositions required great proficiency in the performer, which resulted in there being only rare satisfactory performances. That situation did not improve in Mexico's musical environment. There being few musicians available who could perform his works, <b>his</b> <b>need</b> <b>to</b> find an alternative way of having his pieces performed became pressing. Taking a suggestion from Henry Cowell's book New Musical Resources, which he bought in New York in 1939, Nancarrow found the answer in the player piano, with its ability to produce extremely complex rhythmic patterns at a speed far beyond the abilities of humans.|$|E
