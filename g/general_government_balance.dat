We focus on projections for real GDP growth and <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>balances,</b> revenues and spending at different time horizons. We show that deviations from the projections presented in the Programs since 1999 can be explained by institutional factors, i. e., the form of fiscal governance and the stringency of fiscal rules. As governments seem to use these projections strategically, they should not be regarded as mere forecasts of economic and fiscal developments. Furthermore, whether or not governments stick closely to the projections made in the Programs does not necessarily indicate how well they do in terms of abiding by the rules of the Stability and Growth Pact...|$|R

40|$|In recent decades, Russia's {{foreign policy}} {{was shaped by}} both a number of {{internal}} factors (government strategy, political elites, culture, economics and demography) and external ones (international treaties, changes {{in the structure of}} the international power balance). In the post-soviet era Russian foreign policy was radically different from that of other major economic powers.

The shift from the former communist regime (a totalitarian one) to an authoritarian oligarchy (the current regime) was followed by the transition to a market economy, a phenomenon that coincided with Russia’s military and political diminished influence in the international arena.

40|$|The {{concept of}} {{financial}} balances {{implies that the}} <b>general</b> <b>government</b> <b>balance</b> can be improved only if the enterprise sector and the foreign sector simultaneously increase their financial deficits and the household sector cuts its surplus. This paper explores how these adjustments can be influenced by economic policy during “a period of diminished expectations” (a period of weak GDP growth {{which is expected to}} persist for the coming years). Credit financed growth of private investment is unlikely to accelerate as capacity utilization rates are low. Increased spending by the foreign sector, which allows an export oriented growth strategy, could be dampened by simultaneous budget consolidation efforts of all European countries. Savings rates of private households have increased during the crisis. In order to reduce them various alternatives are discussed. Firstly, a credit financed housing bubble This has been practiced by some economies in recent years, but proved to be not sustainable. Secondly, a decline of unemployment rates and consequently of precautionary saving: During periods of low growth of GDP and employment, improvements in the employment elasticity of growth enhancing policy measures and reductions of working time could be effective in this respect. Thirdly, incentives for upper income households to expand investment expenditures and cut back their savings. Fourthly, a redistribution of wealth and income: This strategy leads to a decrease of average savings rates and an increase of consumption rates of private households.

30|$|Fiscal {{conditions}} are controlled for {{by means of}} the <b>general</b> <b>government</b> budget <b>balance.</b> The expectation is that, in the case of reforms that are costly to the budget, a larger fiscal space favours reforms. The spread with respect to Germany of real interest rates on 10 year government bonds is also included as a measure of markets’ perception of fiscal conditions 11. The expected effect of such a variable is not obvious. On the one hand, higher spreads may signal stronger market pressure to reform. On the other hand, they are associated with a reduced fiscal space to accommodate reforms with an impact on the budget. Another hypothesis that has often been put to the test is that fiscal consolidation makes reforms less likely by reducing the political capital available to governments. We have not pursued that route as, in our sample, fiscal consolidation measures raise a strong suspicion of endogeneity, especially with reform measures with an impact on the budget, but also with those reforms that were triggered during the crisis in a context of capital flight, revenue losses linked to deep recessions, and bond market tensions, where governments had to respond simultaneously by tightening the budget and stepping up the reform agenda.|$|R
