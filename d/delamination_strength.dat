40|$|Aortic {{dissection}} (AoD) is {{a common}} condition that often leads to life-threatening cardiovascular emergency. From a biomechanics viewpoint, AoD involves failure of load-bearing microstructural components of the aortic wall, mainly elastin and collagen fibers. <b>Delamination</b> <b>strength</b> of the aortic wall depends on the load-bearing capacity and local micro-architecture of these fibers, which may vary with age, disease and aortic location. Therefore, quantifying the role of fiber micro-architecture on the <b>delamination</b> <b>strength</b> of the aortic wall may lead to improved understanding of AoD. We present an experimentally-driven modeling paradigm towards this goal. Specifically, we utilize collagen fiber micro-architecture, obtained in a parallel study from multi-photon microscopy, in a predictive mechanistic framework to characterize the <b>delamination</b> <b>strength.</b> We then validate our model against peel test experiments on human aortic strips and utilize the model to predict the <b>delamination</b> <b>strength</b> of separate aortic strips and compare with experimental findings. We observe that the number density and failure energy of the radially-running collagen fibers control the peel strength. Furthermore, our model suggests that the lower <b>delamination</b> <b>strength</b> previously found for the circumferential direction in human aorta is related to a lower number density of radially-running collagen fibers in that direction.

40|$|Composite {{stiffened}} panels {{have been}} extensively used in primary aerospace applications, {{due to their}} efficient stiffness/weight ratio {{and the ability to}} tailor properties. Despite their apparent superiority to metals, the susceptibility of composites to damage {{has proved to be a}} critical factor. A common example in practice is the barely visible impact damage caused by a low velocity impact event.

40|$|Objectives To {{evaluate}} {{the influence of}} post surface pretreatment on the <b>delamination</b> <b>strength</b> of different cements from a prefabricated FRC post tested in a three-point bending test. Methods Three cements were tested; RelyX Unicem, DC Core Automix, and Panavia F 2. 0. Per cement, 40 posts (D. T. Light Post Illusion size 3) were divided into four groups; no pretreatment (control), sandblasting, silanization, and sandblasting followed by silanization. A cement layer {{was applied to the}} posts using a standardized poly-oxy-methacrylate mold. The specimens were subjected to a three-point bending test recording the initial and catastrophic failure loads. Two-way ANOVA and Tukey post-hoc tests were used to analyze the differences between the variables. Results At the initial failure load, all specimens demonstrated delamination of the cement layer, therefore initial failure load was defined as <b>delamination</b> <b>strength.</b> With RelyX Unicem, none of the pretreatments showed significant differences. When using Panavia F 2. 0, silanization (735 Â± 51 MPa) resulted in higher initial failure values than sandblasting (600 Â± 118 MPa). When DC Core Automix was used, silanization (732 Â± 144 MPa) produced significantly higher initial failure values than the no pretreatment group (518 Â± 115 MPa) and the combined sandblasting and silanization group (560 Â± 223 MPa). Two failure types were observed; cohesive and adhesive failure. In the silanization groups, more cohesive failures were observed for all cements tested.

Delamination is one of most common failure mechanisms for composite materials. By interleaving a nanofibrous mat between laminate plies it can be possible to control the interlaminar <b>delamination</b> <b>strength.</b> The nanofibrous mat at a laminate interface is impregnated by the resin during the curing process.

X-radiography was used to monitor damage developments. First-ply failure stress, and tensile strength were recorded. First-ply failure of the midplane 90 plies depended on the stiffness of constraint plies, and size. All 24 cases were predicted using Zhang's shear-lag model and data generated from [0 2 / 90 2] s cross-ply tests. Laminate strength was controlled by the initiation of a triangular-shaped local delamination of the surface angle plies.

This form of disease is a predisposing factor for spontaneous aortic dissection which in general results in the initiation of an intimal flap and its propagation due to blood flow. Since aortic dissection fails by separation of the elastic layers [2], the <b>delamination</b> <b>strength</b> of ATAA tissues was investigated by designing and performing mechanical tests that simulate the in-vivo tearing condition of the aortic wall. Specifically, the delamination tests were carried out on nonaneurysmal and aneurysmal human ascending thoracic tissues with bicuspid (BAV) and tricuspid (TAV) aortic valves. The influence of the anisotropy on these properties was investigated by testing oriented specimen strips which morphology was studied with SEM. Thus imaging techniques and 3 D reconstruction software were used to obtain the 3 D shape of ATAAs for estimating the wall stress distribution in future investigations. On the basis of a methodology developed in our laboratory [3], the geometry of ATAAs was reconstructed for patients routinely undergoing imaging analysis prior to surgical repair. Surfaces corresponding to the aortic wall were created with segmentation and smoothing techniques to yield virtual aneurysms ready for finite element analyses.
