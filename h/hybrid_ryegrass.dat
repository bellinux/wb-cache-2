40|$|Substitution of {{a species}} or {{cultivar}} with higher uptake of an element by one with lower uptake has been proposed as a remediation strategy following accidental releases of radioactivity. However, despite the importance of pasture systems for radiological dose, species/cultivar substitution has not been thoroughly investigated for forage grasses. 397 cultivars from four forage grass species; <b>hybrid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> (Lolium perenne L. x Lolium multiflorum Lam.), perennial ryegrass (Lolium perenne L.), Italian ryegrass (Lolium multiflorum Lam.) and tall fescue (Festuca arundinacea Shreb.); were sampled from 19 field-based breeding experiments in Aberystwyth and Edinburgh (UK) in spring 2013 and analysed for caesium (Cs) and strontium (Sr) concentrations. In order to calculate concentration ratios (CRs; the concentration of an element in a plant {{in relation to the}} concentration in the soil), soils from the experiments were also analysed to calculate extractable concentrations of Cs and Sr. To test if cultivars have consistently low Cs and Sr concentration ratios, 17 <b>hybrid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> cultivars were sampled from both sites again in summer 2013 and spring and summer 2014. Tall fescue cultivars had lower Cs and Sr CRs than the other species. Three of the selected 17 <b>hybrid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> cultivars had consistently low Cs CRs, two had consistently low Sr CRs and one had consistently low Cs and Sr CRs.

40|$|Radioisotopes of caesium (Cs) and {{strontium}} (Sr) {{have been}} {{distributed in the}} environment due to weapons testing, nuclear power production and accidents at nuclear facilities. Radiocaesium and radiostrontium are of major concern in the medium to long term following accidental releases as they have high energies, long half lives (137 Cs≈ 30 years; 90 Sr≈ 29 years) and their easy assimilation into biological systems due to their similarity to the biologically important elements potassium (K) and calcium (Ca), respectively. Radio-caesium and -strontium are transferred to humans primarily via plant root uptake, and therefore minimising this uptake {{has been the focus}} of a number of remediation strategies, such as ploughing and fertiliser application. Species or cultivar substitution, where a species/cultivar that has higher uptake is replaced by a species/cultivar that has lower uptake, has been proposed as an effective and socially acceptable remediation strategy for contaminated agricultural land, but not enough is known about its efficacy for it to be recommended internationally. The aim of this thesis is to evaluate the potential of species or cultivar substitution as a remediation strategy for contaminated agricultural areas. Chapter 2 consists of meta-analysis of the available data (115 experiments) on the inter-cultivar variation in Cs and Sr accumulation by 27 plant species. Chapter 3 includes experiments conducted in the laboratory (UK) and two experiments in the field (Ukraine) investigating inter-cultivar variation in radiocaesium and radiostrontium accumulation in Brassica oleracea, and whether consistently lower-accumulating cultivars could be identified. Chapter 4 details analysis of samples from grass breeding experiments in Aberystwyth and Edinburgh (UK) from four forage grass species; <b>hybrid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> (Lolium perenne L. x Lolium multiflorum Lam.), L. perenne, L. multiflorum and Festuca arundinacea Shreb., and investigates inter-species and inter-cultivar variation in uptake of stable Cs and Sr. <b>Hybrid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> cultivars that were lower-accumulating in Cs and/or Sr were also identified. Chapter 5 compares the stable Cs and Sr uptake in six L. perenne and two F. arundinacea cultivars grown in Aberystwyth and Narodychi (Ukraine). Chapter 6 compares the performance in terms of yield and forage quality (elemental concentrations, digestibility and water soluble carbohydrate content) of six <b>hybrid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> cultivars and ten F. arundinacea cultivars identified as consistently lower-accumulating in Cs and/or Sr against the performance of two commercial <b>hybrid</b> <b>ryegrass</b> cultivars. The mean inter-cultivar variation in Cs and Sr was 1. 8 -fold and 2. 0 -fold, respectively when 27 plant species were studied. Thirty-five-fold variation in radiocaesium and 23 -fold variation in radiostrontium was found between c. 70 Brassica oleracea cultivars. In two field experiments in Ukraine, five cultivars had consistently lower radiocaesium concentration ratios and two cultivars consistently lower radiostrontium concentration ratios.

40|$|Festulolium (Festulolium) {{and tall}} fescue (Festuca arundinacea) {{has not been}} grown in Sweden over a longer period. So far {{there is no greater}} area cultivated, but the area is increasing. Festulolium and tall fescue are {{expected}} to eventually replace meadow fescue in many leyseed mixtures to dairy cows in southern and central Sweden. Tall fescue has in recent years become popular again. Festulolium is a <b>hybrid</b> between <b>ryegrass</b> and fescue. Festulolium has high yields and good quality feed from ryegrass and good drying resistance and winterhardiness from fescue. Some festulolium varieties remind most of ryegrass, while others remind most of tall fescue. We have done a literature review and compiled the Swedish and international trials of seed cultivation of festulolium and tall fescue. We sent out a questionnaire to all growers of festulolium and tall fescue in Sweden to hear their experiences {{and to be able to}} compare their results with experimental results. Of the 20 growers we sent the questionnaire to 15 responded. The literature study showed that you got the best seed yield on clay soils if you do not have access to irrigation. A distance between rows of 24 cm is the ultimate in both conventional and organic farming and a seed amount of 8 kg/ha gave the best yield in both field trials and survey. Survey results shows that farmers add too little nitrogen to festulolium and tall fescue compared with the recommendations in the cultivation guidances and the results of field trials. Survey results shows that a well-established festulolium or tall fescue has little need of herbicides apart from the year of establishment. Results from the survey show that there is little or no attack of diseases and pests in the festulolium and tall fescue in Sweden. Growth regulation gives on average 20 % higher yield in field trials, but it is important that the crop is in good growth and not stressed by drought. Most conventional farmers growth regulated festulolium and tall fescue. If there is risk of rain, swath harvesting is not a good strategy in festulolium and tall fescue. Swath harvesting, however normally gives a higher yield but is a little more time consuming than direct harvesting. Festulolium and tall fescue appears to be a suitable crop for organic leyseed growers because the difference in the yield is small compared with conventional cultivation. We believe that there is a need for field trials with nitrogen fertilization in festulolium and tall fescue. Additionally, there is a need for field trials with growth regulation in varieties of festulolium like Felopa which has different growth characteristics than Hykor. The weakness of the thesis is that there are a limited number of growers of festulolium and tall fescue in Sweden and thus we have a rather limited number of surveys to work with...|$|R

The cultivars were grown in 2001, 2004 and 2007 at 29, 32 and 27 European sites, respectively. Rust incidence was scored during different growth cycles using {{a scale from}} one (no rust) to nine (susceptible). Crown rust (Puccinia coronata f. sp. lolii) was the most frequently observed rust species on Italian, <b>hybrid</b> and perennial <b>ryegrass</b> during all three experimental years. There was a highly significant difference in mean crown rust scores among Italian and perennial ryegrass cultivars, respectively, {{in each of the}} 3 years. The ranking of the cultivars was very consistent across the different sites within each year (with some exceptions), despite a significant interaction of cultivar response with sites. Moreover, the rank order correlations of mean cultivar rust scores were highly significant (r > 0. 9) between the years. Stem rust (P. graminis f. sp. graminicola) occurred almost exclusively on perennial ryegrass. The cultivars showed significant variation in stem rust susceptibility. Rank order correlations of mean cultivar stem rust scores were mostly significant between sites within each year and highly significant between the years. The ranking of perennial ryegrass cultivars was different depending on whether crown or stem rust was scored. However, the rank order correlation between the mean disease scores of the cultivars for the two pathogens was low but still significant.

On 13 October 2004 and 17 March 2005, half of each plot was ploughed and sown with either winter or spring barley, respectively. Barley was harvested as whole-crop at the dough stage. Soil samples were collected from all plots in autumn 2004, spring 2005 and autumn 2005 for soil mineral N (SMN) analyses and ceramic cups were used to assess nitrate leaching from red clover plots. The grain DM yield of barley was higher when cultivating winter barley compared with spring barley when sown following Zero-N ryegrass (P 0. 05). The total N leached from red clover plots was higher from winter-cultivated barley plots (57 kg N ha? 1) compared with spring cultivated barley plots (35 kg N ha? 1) (P < 0. 01). Overall, the results showed that the best practice to optimise the recovery of SMN by a subsequent cereal crop following legumes in this study was to cultivate and sow barley in spring rather than in autumn whereas, when sowing cereals after ryegrass, the best use of SMN was obtained when cereals were sown in the autumn compared with the spring.

On all evaluation dates, the treatment effect was significant for all visual response variables measured (quality, color, texture, density, etc.). The mixture of LHRT hybrid ryegrass/Poa trivialis established quicker than other treatments during the first month (November). Perennial ryegrass entries provided the darkest color turf. Among hybrid ryegrasses, Pick A- 97 was slightly darker in turf color when compared to LHRT. LHRT alone was darker in color than when mixed with Poa trivialis. In terms of overall turf quality, Pick A- 97 and LHRT hybrid ryegrasses were essentially equal in performance. The spring decline was greater among hybrid ryegrasses than that of perennial ryegrass. Both hybrid ryegrasses (A- 97 and LHRT) were superior to annual ryegrasses {{in all aspects of}} turf performance. By mid-June of 1999, Pick A- 97 had more bermudagrass present (52 %) than LHRT (28 %). LHRT had more straw-colored (dead transition grass) than A- 97 as well.

At a seed rate of 625 lbs PLS/acre, all entries produced acceptable "dense" turfs, with the exception of Gulf annual. The hybrids 05 ABL and 04 - 2 LH produced very dense turfs, with high apparent shoot densities very similar to that of perennial ryegrass. Both 04 - 1 LH and 0 5 ABD hybrids also produced satisfactory turf densities as well. While the perennial ryegrass "American Star" had very narrow leaves, the hybrid 04 2 LH also had fine leaves throughout the season. Hybrid 05 ABL was also fine textured. After emergence, 04 - 1 LH hybrid had somewhat wider leaves than some of the other hybrids, but it produced finer leaves shortly afterwards until the close of the test. Measured leaf widths ranged from 1. 4 to 2. 7 mm in February under peak performance conditions of growth and weather. American Star perennial ryegrass ranked highest for quality on most occasions, but was often included in the same statistical mean performance grouping (within the same LSD value range) with the hybrid entries of 04 - 2 LH, 04 - 1 LH, 05 ABD, and 05 ABL.

Whole-mount surface spreading of synaptonemal complexes from 35 pollen mother cell nuclei shows that chromosome pairing during meiotic prophase is highly irregular, with homoeologues and heterologues pairing together to form multivalents.

After 2 years, frequent grazing (set stocking) by sheep reduced caucasian clover cover to 10 % compared with 25. 5 % in infrequent grazing (rotational grazing) treatments (mean spelling time 25 days). Similarly, frequent grazing reduced caucasian clover rhizome plus root dry weight (780 kg DM/ha when sampled to 100 mm depth in frequently grazed plots, compared with 3220 kg DM/ha for infrequent). Under frequent grazing treatments, mean white clover cover was 21 %, under infrequent hard grazing it was 26 % and under lax infrequent grazing it was 14 %. The reduction in ryegrass tiller population from 5720 /m² in the infrequently and laxly grazed treatments to 4150 / m² in the frequently hard grazed pastures indicated the severity of that hard grazed treatment.
