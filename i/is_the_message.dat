25|$|Distinct {{appearance}} and clothing {{was one of}} the immediate legacies of hippies worldwide. During the 1960s and 1970s, mustaches, beards and long hair became more commonplace and colorful, while multi-ethnic clothing dominated the fashion world. Since that time, a wide range of personal appearance options and clothing styles, including nudity, have become more widely acceptable, all of which was uncommon before the hippie era. Hippies also inspired the decline in popularity of the necktie and other business clothing, which had been unavoidable for men during the 1950s and early 1960s. Additionally, hippie fashion itself has been commonplace in the years since the 1960s in clothing and accessories, particularly the peace symbol. Astrology, including everything from serious study to whimsical amusement regarding personal traits, was integral to hippie culture. The generation of the 1970s became influenced by the hippie and the 60s countercultural legacy. As such in New York City musicians and audiences from the female, homosexual, black, and Latino communities adopted several traits from the hippies and psychedelia. They included overwhelming sound, free-form dancing, weird lighting, colorful costumes, and hallucinogens. Psychedelic soul groups like the Chambers Brothers and especially Sly and The Family Stone influenced proto-disco acts such as Isaac Hayes, Willie Hutch and the Philadelphia Sound. In addition, the perceived positivity, lack of irony, and earnestness of the hippies informed proto-disco music like M.F.S.B.'s album Love <b>Is</b> <b>the</b> <b>Message.</b>|$|E

500|$|Thompson came to {{national}} {{prominence in the}} controversy over 2 Live Crew's As Nasty As They Wanna Be album. (Luke Skyywalker Records, the company of 2 Live Crew's Luther Campbell, had previously released a record supporting Reno in her race against Thompson.) On January 1, 1990, he wrote to Martinez and Reno asking them to investigate whether the album violated Florida obscenity laws. Although the state prosecutor declined to proceed with an investigation, Thompson pushed local officials {{in various parts of}} the state to block sales of the album, along with N.W.A’s Straight Outta Compton. In sending documents to opponents, Thompson would frequently attach a photocopy of his driver's license, with a photo of Batman pasted over his own. Thompson said, [...] "I have sent my opponents pictures of Batman to remind them I'm playing the role of Batman. Just like Bruce Wayne helped the police in the movie, I have had to assist the sheriff of Broward County." [...] He also wore a Batman wristwatch. Thompson compared Campbell to the Joker. Thompson also said, [...] "I understand as well as anybody that the First Amendment is a cornerstone of a free society—but there is a responsibility to people who can be harmed by words and thoughts, one of which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> from Campbell that women can be sexually abused." ...|$|E
500|$|Trembling Before G-d {{has had a}} wide impact {{especially}} {{within the}} Orthodox Jewish world, where the reception has been mixed. Several Orthodox synagogues sponsored showings of the film all over the world, including in Israel. The Chief Rabbi of South Africa, Warren Goldstein, described the film as [...] "intellectually shallow," [...] commenting that [...] "its one-sided caricature of Orthodox Judaism does not stimulate meaningful intellectual debate." [...] A rabbi interviewed by DuBowski complained that the film [...] "makes us appear to be narrow and bigoted". Arthur A. Goldberg, co-director of the Jewish ex-gay organization JONAH, {{wrote a letter to}} the editor of The Jerusalem Post lamenting the [...] "film's biased and faulty assumption that same-sex attraction and behavior is irreversible" [...] and that [...] "opposing points of view were, in the reviewer's words, left 'lying on DuBowski's cutting room floor.'" [...] Orthodox clinical psychologist Adam Jessel commented that, [...] "the film poignantly captures the torment of those torn between their religious beliefs and their same-sex attractions (SSA). One cannot help but feel compassion for DuBowski's interviewees who desperately miss the lifestyle, community and close family ties of the Orthodox world. Unfortunately, DuBowski's film goes further. Implicit in the film <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> that homosexuality is desirable, and that the interviewees' only struggle is having their choices accepted and validated by the community." ...|$|E

500|$|Roger Ebert gave a very {{positive}} review. [...] "Superman is a pure delight, a wondrous combination of all the old-fashioned things we never really get tired of: adventure and romance, heroes and villains, earthshaking special effects and wit. Reeve is perfectly cast in the role. Any poor choice would have ruined the film." [...] Ebert placed the film on his 10 best list of 1978. He would later go on to place it on his [...] "Great Movies" [...] list. James Berardinelli believed [...] "there's no doubt that it's a flawed movie, but it's {{one of the most}} wonderfully entertaining flawed movies made during the 1970s. It's exactly what comic book fans hoped it would be. Perhaps most heartening of all, however, <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> {{at the end of the}} credits announcing the impending arrival of Superman II." [...] Harry Knowles is a longtime fan of the film, but was critical of elements that did not represent the Superman stories as seen in the comics. Dave Kehr felt [...] "the tone, style, and point of view change almost from shot to shot. This is the definitive corporate film. It is best when it takes itself seriously, worst when it takes the easy way out in giggly camp. When Lex Luthor enters the action, Hackman plays the arch-villain like a hairdresser left over from a TV skit." [...] Neal Gabler similarly felt that the film focused too much on shallow comedy. He also argued that the film should have adhered more to the spirit of Mario Puzo's original script, and referred to the first three Superman films collectively as [...] "simply puffed-up TV episodes." ...|$|E

The director was changed from Vikram Bhatt (who was the original Raaz director) to Mohit Suri. Suri had reportedly added a lot of dramatic space to the film and played around with visuals and sounds which led to an extraordinary pace. Suri got inspired about the movie after reading a lot on Hindu mythology, where good and evil are represented in stark contrast.|$|E

2500|$|The Fathers of the Church dwell {{constantly}} on the symbolism of this hour. Noon is the hour {{when the sun is}} at its full, it is the image of Divine splendour, the plenitude of God, the time of grace; at the sixth hour Abraham received the three angels. We should pray at noon, says St. Ambrose, because that is the time when the Divine light is in its fulness. Origen, St. Augustine, and several others regard this hour as favourable to prayer. Lastly and above all, it was the hour when Christ was nailed to the Cross; this memory excelling all the others left a still visible trace in most of the liturgy of this hour. This scene from Good Friday is the background for Sext. [...] "Lead us not into temptation" [...] <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>message</b> of this hour.
