5|$|Structure 57 {{is a large}} mound at the {{southern}} limit of the Central Group with an excellent view across the coastal plain. The structure {{was built in the}} Late Preclassic and underwent a second phase of construction in the Late Classic. It may <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> look-out point.|$|E
5|$|Structure 66 {{is located}} on Terrace9, at the {{northern}} extreme of the North Group. It had an excellent view across the entire city and may <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> sentry post controlling access to the site. It dates from the Terminal Classic through to the Postclassic.|$|E
5|$|The New Orleans Mint {{has been}} {{designated}} a National Historic Landmark, {{and it is the}} oldest extant structure to <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> U.S. Mint. Along with the Charlotte Mint, it is one of two former mint facilities in the U.S. to house an art gallery.|$|E

5|$|In 2007–2008, the {{promenade}} hosted five sculptures made by Mark di Suvero, hosted at the smaller Boeing Galleries. Chicago Tribune art critic, Alan G. Artner, noted that di Suvero {{was limited to}} his midsize pieces {{because of the size}} of the gallery, and even these were a bit tightly bunched. He felt the Chase Promenade might <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> better forum and would have left the artist unfettered to choose from a wider range of pieces.|$|E
5|$|Oppressive efforts, {{often led}} by Poles, {{including}} Crown tenants or their Jewish plenipotents, Ruthenian nobles of the Commonwealth and even upper-rank Cossack officers, to subjugate and exploit economically the Cossack territories and population in Zaporizhia region, {{resulted in a}} series of Cossack uprisings, of which the early ones could <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> warning for szlachta legislators. While Ukraine was undergoing substantial economic development, Cossacks and peasants were by and large not among the beneficiaries of the process.|$|E
5|$|The church {{features}} two stories: {{while the}} upper story {{was certainly the}} church proper and the place of liturgy, {{the role of the}} lower story is unclear. Its construction may have been necessitated due to the unfavourable rocky terrain, or it may <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> tomb or a storage facility. The latter is considered more likely because no human remains have been discovered inside, even though the lower stories of similar churches were commonly used as tombs.|$|E

5|$|The event {{also may}} <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> {{symbolic}} exorcism of Charles's mental illness {{at a time}} when magicians and sorcerers were commonly consulted by members of the court. In the early 15th century, ritual burning of evil, demonic, or Satanic forces was not uncommon as shown by Orléans's later persecution of the King's physician Jehan de Bar, who was burned to death after confessing, under torture, to practicing sorcery.|$|E
5|$|The site can be {{generally}} {{divided into three}} broad areas, the site core, a North Zone and an East Zone. The North Zone is separated from the site core by a wide depression containing clay soil that may <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> reservoir for the city. Several quarries have been identified on {{the northern and southern}} edges of this depression.|$|E
5|$|The smokehouse is {{a square}} two-story {{building}} with a hipped roof, and is believed to date to the early 19th century. East of the smokehouse, a 1-story {{building with a}} three bay facade and a gabled roof {{was used as a}} post office in the late 19th century, and may <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> schoolhouse originally. The manager's farmhouse stands 2 stories high and is L-shaped with a porch. The springhouse is also 2 stories.|$|E

5|$|While not {{initially}} a success with North American audiences, Blade Runner was popular internationally and garnered a cult following. The film's dark style and futuristic designs <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> benchmark {{and its influence}} {{can be seen in}} many subsequent science fiction films, video games, anime, and television programs. For example, Ronald D. Moore and David Eick, the producers of the re-imagining of Battlestar Galactica, have both cited Blade Runner as one of the major influences for the show.|$|E
5|$|After that war, {{he moved}} to a more prestigious hussar unit (rota), and likely due to a {{reduction}} of the royal army, {{he served in the}} private formation of Władysław Myszkowski and later, voivode Stanisław Lubomirski. In 1635 he might <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> military adviser to John II Casimir Vasa, and possibly accompanied the king to Vienna. In 1637 he married Zofia Kobierzycka, and later that year he fought in the Pawluk Uprising against the rebellious Cossacks under Pavel Mikhnovych, participating in the battle of Kumejki. He led a cavalry charge at Kumejki which was instrumental for the Polish victory there. Earlier that year he served as a military delegate to the Sejm (parliament) in Warsaw.|$|E
5|$|Borobudur differs {{markedly}} {{from the}} general design of other structures built for this purpose. Instead of being built on a flat surface, Borobudur is built on a natural hill. However, construction technique is similar to other temples in Java. Without the inner spaces seen in other temples, and with a general design similar {{to the shape of}} pyramid, Borobudur was first thought more likely to <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> stupa, instead of a temple. A stupa is intended as a shrine for the Buddha. Sometimes stupas were built only as devotional symbols of Buddhism. A temple, on the other hand, is used as a house of worship. The meticulous complexity of the monument's design suggests that Borobudur is in fact a temple.|$|E

5|$|Castleshaw Roman fort was a castellum in the Roman {{province}} of Britannia. Although {{there is no}} evidence to substantiate the claim, it has been suggested that Castleshaw Roman fort is the site of Rigodunum, a Brigantian settlement. The remains of the fort are located on Castle Hill on the eastern side of Castleshaw Valley at the foot of Standedge but overlooking the valley. The hill is on the edge of Castleshaw in Greater Manchester. The fort was constructed in c.AD79, but fell out of use at some time during the 90s. It was replaced by a smaller fortlet, built in c.105, around which a civilian settlement grew. It may <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> logistical and administrative centre, although it was abandoned in the 120s.|$|E
5|$|Diplodocus had an {{extremely}} long tail, composed of about 80 caudal vertebrae, which are {{almost double the}} number some of the earlier sauropods had in their tails (such as Shunosaurus with 43), and far more than contemporaneous macronarians had (such as Camarasaurus with 53). Some speculation exists {{as to whether it}} may have had a defensive or noisemaking (by cracking it like a coachwhip) function. The tail may <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> counterbalance for the neck. The middle part of the tail had 'double beams' (oddly shaped chevron bones on the underside, which gave Diplodocus its name). They may have provided support for the vertebrae, or perhaps prevented the blood vessels from being crushed if the animal's heavy tail pressed against the ground. These 'double beams' are also seen in some related dinosaurs.|$|E
5|$|Following its destruction, Nagar was rebuilt by the Akkadian empire, to form {{a center}} of the provincial administration. The city {{included}} the whole tell and a lower town at {{the southern edge of}} the mound. Two public buildings were built during the early Akkadian periods, one complex in area SS, and another in area FS. The building of area FS included its own temple and might <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> caravanserai, being located near the northern gate of the city. The early Akkadian monarchs were occupied with internal conflicts, and Tell Brak was temporarily abandoned by Akkad at some point preceding the reign of Naram-Sin. The abandonment might be connected with an environmental event, that caused the desertification of the region.|$|E

5|$|The axis of {{the pyramid}} complex may be {{associated}} with a series of monuments strung out along a kilometer of desert. Along this axis are several key structures: 1) a large pyramid dedicated to his grandmother Tetisheri which contained a stele depicting Ahmose providing offerings to her; 2) a rockcut underground complex which may either <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> token representation of an Osirian underworld or as an actual royal tomb; and 3) a terraced temple built against the high cliffs, featuring massive stone and brick terraces. These elements reflect in general a similar plan undertaken for the cenotaph of Senwosret III and in general its construction contains elements which reflect the style of both Old and Middle Kingdom pyramid complexes.|$|E
5|$|The {{distinctive}} {{sound of}} Enter the Wu-Tang (36 Chambers) created {{a blueprint for}} hardcore hip hop during the 1990s and helped return New York City hip hop to national prominence. Its sound also became greatly influential in modern hip hop production, while the group members' explicit, humorous, and free-associative lyrics <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> template for many subsequent hip hop records. Serving as a landmark record {{in the era of}} hip hop known as the East Coast Renaissance, its influence helped lead the way for several other East Coast hip hop artists, including Nas, The Notorious B.I.G., Mobb Deep, and Jay-Z.|$|E
5|$|The first {{example of}} his final stage {{can be seen in}} a simple but very ingenious building, the Sagrada Família schools, a small school for the workers' children. Built in 1909, it has a {{rectangular}} ground plan of , and contained three classrooms, a vestibule and a chapel. It was built of exposed brick, in three overlapping layers, following the traditional Catalan method. The walls and roof have an undulating shape, giving the structure a sense of lightness but also strength. The Sagrada Família schools have set an example of constructive genius and <b>have</b> <b>served</b> <b>as</b> <b>a</b> source of inspiration for many architects, such is their simplicity, strength, originality, functionality and geometric excellence.|$|E
