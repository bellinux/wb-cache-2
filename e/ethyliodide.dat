In this work, 2, 3 -bis[2 - (diethylamino) ethylsulfanyl]-quinoxaline- 6, 7 -dicarbonitrile {{was chosen as}} the starting material. The synthesis of 2, 3, 11, 12, 20, 21, 29, 30 -Octakis[2 -(diethylamino) ethylsulfanyl]tetra-[6, 7]- quinoxalinoporphyrazine zinc(II) (ZnTQP) by the cyclization of precursor with zinc acetate in DMF failed. That is why, I prepared the magnesium complex of TQP first, then I obtained the metal-free TQP from it using acid (HCl). Incorporation of Zn ions into the center of TQP was accomplished by treatment of the metal-free derivative with zinc acetate. Finally, ZnTQP was treated with <b>ethyliodide</b> and the water soluble ZnTQP, with quaternary ammonium groups, was obtained. The new compounds were characterized by using standard spectral methods (UV-vis, IR, 1 H NMR, 13 C NMR, mass spectra, elemental analysis) ...|$|E
40|$|Measurements on Hirschfelder atomic {{models of}} {{acetylcholine}} {{and other drugs}} with specific muscarinic action have shown that these agents have similar inter-atomic distance between the oxygen groups and methyl-on-nitrogen groups (1). Furthermore, agents such as atropine and its congeners which specifically block muscarinic effects possess similar pharmaphore 2 groups {{in addition to the}} block-ing moieties represented by one or more butyl and benzyl groups. The structure of d-tubocurarine resembles that of atrophic in the spatial arrangement of the pharmaphore groups; it differs from atropine in that it contains twin rows of these groups instead of a single row (2). That the arrangement of twin rows of pharmaphore groups {{is an important factor in}} endowing the molecule with curare-like action has been demonstrated by a study of bis-atropiniu. m compounds in which a pentamethylene chain linked the two atropine molecules. A 5 -carbon chain was chosen since Bovet et ci. (3) have shown that amy! diethers such as pentamethylene-bis-(8 -oxyquinoline <b>ethyliodide)</b> (3381 R. P.) have curare action. The pentamethylene-bis-atropin...|$|E

Prof. PharmDr. Petr Zimčík PhD. Title: Synthesis of {{cationic}} phthalocyanines In my thesis, I {{dealt with}} the preparation of cationic phthalocyanines containing quaternary ammonium groups in peripheral chains that are attached to α or β positions of the macrocycle. The synthesis of precursors for cyclotetramerization {{was the first step}} of this work. They were prepared by nucleophilic substitution of aromatic dicarbonitriles by 2 - (diethylamino) ethanthiolate. These precursors were used to cyclotetramerization in presence of magnesium butoxide. Magnesium phthalocyanines were prepared by this procedure. Magnesium complexes were converted to metal-free phthalocyanines in acidic medium. Then, they reacted with anhydrous zinc acetate to form zinc phthalocyanines. Subsequently, alkylation of peripheral amino groups by <b>ethyliodide</b> led to quaternized Pc. In addition, the derivates with substitution in α positions did not aggregate in aqueous media. Furthermore, zinc phtalocyanine substituted in α positions had very good photochemical properties. That is why it may become potential photosensitizer with promising photodynamic activity...|$|E
40|$|In this work, chitin, {{the second}} most {{abundant}} biopolymer in the nature, was used as antimicrobial agent for textile finishing. Antimicrobial agents can protect textiles from attack of microorganisms, which are {{the reason for the}} damage of textiles and for the discomfort of the people. Chitin is known as skin friendly, nontoxic and environmentally sound antimicrobial agent. Chitin is not soluble in water, thus it has to be derivatized for application in textile finishing which is performed usually from aqueous media. At first, chitosan, the deacetylated form of chitin, was depolymerized with sodium nitrite to produce chitooligosaccharides. The degree of polymerization was determined by colorimetry. Furthermore, chitosan was modified with quaternary ammonium groups to get a better soluble product {{and at the same time}} a better effect against bacteria. For this, chitosan was reacted with diethylaminoethyl groups at the hydroxy and amino groups. The synthesized product was characterized with the help of IR-, Raman-, NMR- and 2 D-NMR-spectroscopy as well as by elemental analysis and TGA. The degree of substitution was determined by means of NMR-spectroscopy, elemental analysis and conductometry. The synthesized product was then quaternized with <b>ethyliodide,</b> dimethylsulfate or diethylsulfate. The structure of the products was confirmed by IR-, Raman- and NMR-spectroscopy. The degree of quaternization was determined with the help of NMR-spectroscopy, elemental analysis and XPS. The synthesized chitosan derivatives were applied onto textiles. Polycarboxylic acid was used to fix the chitosan derivatives on cotton fabrics. The amount of the fixed derivatives on the fabrics was determined by means of elemental analysis. Furthermore, the chitosan derivatives were subjected to antimicrobial tests in solution. TEAE-chitosaniodide and MDEAE-chitosanmethylsulfate show very good activity against Vibrio fischeri, Bacillus subtilis and Escherichia coli...|$|E
40|$|Methods for the 11 C-labeling of {{carbonyl}} compounds applicable {{in the preparation}} of radiotracers for Positron Emission Tomography (PET) are described. To this end [11 C]carbon monoxide at low concentration was used in transition metal- mediated reactions. Stille couplings were employed in the synthesis of [carbonyl- 11 C]ketones from methyl and aryl halides with [11 C]carbon monoxide. The synthesized [carbonyl- 11 C]ketones were obtained from the corresponding organostannanes with analytical radiochemical yields up to 98 %. A number of synthetic routes were designed using [11 C]carbon monoxide and rhodium complexes. Nitrene intermediates were generated from azides and reacted via a rhodium-mediated carbonylation reaction as a general synthetic route to [carbonyl- 11 C]isocyanates, versatile precursors. [carbonyl- 11 C]Isocyanate reacted via nucleophilic attack of an amine to form N,N’-diphenyl[11 C]urea in 82 % analytical radiochemical yield, ethyl phenyl[11 C]carbamate was synthesized by the same route, using ethanol as the nucleophile, in 70 % radiochemical yield. [11 C]Isocyanate was also able to react in a [2 + 3] cycloaddition with ethylene oxide to form 3 -phenyl[carbonyl- 11 C]oxazolidin- 2 -one in over 80 % analytical radiochemical yield. This method was applied to the synthesis of a potential efflux system tracer [11 C]hydroxyurea in 38 % isolated radiochemical yield and the derivative 1 -hydroxy- 3 -phenyl[11 C]urea in 35 % isolated radiochemical yield. Carbene intermediates, generated from diazo compounds, were reacted with [11 C]carbon monoxide in the rhodium-mediated synthesis of [carbonyl- 11 C]ketenes. [carbonyl- 11 C]Ketene intermediates were utilised in the synthesis of diethyl[carbonyl- 11 C]malonate, from ethyl diazoacetate and ethanol. The product was obtained with a 20 % isolated radiochemical yield. Alkylation of diethyl[carbonyl- 11 C]malonate, with <b>ethyliodide</b> and tetrabutylammonium fluoride, was successfully accomplished and diethyl diethyl[carbonyl- 11 C]malonate was synthesized in 50 % analytical radiochemical yield. Several (carbonyl- 13 C) compounds were also synthesized using the described methods as a way of characterizing the position of the label using 13 C-NMR...|$|E
