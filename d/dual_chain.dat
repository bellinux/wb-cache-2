There is a clear shortage in the PV industry literature regarding how <b>dual</b> supply <b>chains</b> compete and the key decision issues regarding the competition between <b>dual</b> PV supply <b>chains.</b> It is critical to develop effective subsidy policies for the competing PV supply chains to achieve social welfare maximization. This study has explored the <b>dual</b> PV supply <b>chain</b> competition under the Bertrand competition assumption by three game-theoretical modeling scenarios (or supply chain strategies) considering either the public subsidy or no subsidy from a social welfare maximization perspective. A numerical analysis complemented by two sensitivity analyses provides {{a better understanding of}} the pricing and quantity decision dynamics in the <b>dual</b> supply <b>chains</b> under three different supply chain strategies and the corresponding outcomes regarding the total supply chain profits, the social welfare and the required total subsidies. The key findings disclose that if there are public subsidies, the <b>dual</b> PV supply <b>chains</b> have the strongest intention to pursue the decentralized strategy to achieve their maximal returns rather than the centralized strategy that would achieve the maximal social welfare; however, the government would need to pay for the maximal subsidy budget. Thus, the best option for the government would be to encourage the <b>dual</b> PV supply <b>chains</b> to adopt a centralized strategy since this will not only maximize the social welfare but also, at the same time, minimize the public subsidy. With a smart subsidy policy, the PV industry can make the best use of the subsidy budget and grow in a sustainable way to support the highly demanded solar power generation in many countries trying very hard to increase the proportion of their clean energy to combat the global warming effect.

40|$|Background and aims: The aims of {{this study}} were to {{investigate}} the ligand binding properties and structure of <b>dual</b> <b>chain</b> hybrid avidins (dchAvd) as well as to discuss their applicability in biotechnological applications. Another aim was to optimize the production and purification of these fusion proteins. The study focused on dchAvd structures where a cpAvd 5 4 is genetically combined with a cpAvd 6 5 streptavidin, AVR 2 or AVR 4 protein (dcASA, dcAA 2, dcAA 4). The sequences and biochemical properties of these proteins differ from those of avidin thus serving as a good evaluation basis for the functionality of <b>dual</b> <b>chain</b> hybrid avidins. Methods: dchAvd were produced in E. coli in bottle and in pilot-scale fermentor as well as in Bac-to-Bac insect cell production system. The proteins were purified with affinity chromatography and the purification, yields and purity were monitored by SDS-PAGE and Western Blot. The biotin binding properties of dcAA 4 were studied with fluorescence spectroscopy and Biacore optical biosensor. The oligomerization state of dcAA 4 was studied with HPLC and its heterogeneity was shown by immunological methods where monoclonal antibodies against avidin and AVR 4 were used. Results: dcAA 4 was produced significantly better than dcAA 2 and dcASA in E. coli bottle production. dcAA 4 was produced very well in the fermentor. All three proteins were produced to certain extent in insect cell production system but none of them could be isolated. According to HPLC measurements dcAA 4 is a pseudotetramer. dcAA 4 bound biotin with high affinity but with lower affinity than avidin and AVR 4. Both avidin and AVR 4 monoclonal antibodies recognized dcAA 4. Conclusions: According to the ligand binding studies dcAA 4 had two distinct biotin binding sites. The other one bound biotin with higher affinity and resembled wt avidin biotin binding site, and the other one bound biotin with weaker affinity. dcAA 4 was a heterogenic, pseudotetrameric protein.

40|$|In the 1940 ’s the {{agriculture}} in the Netherlands industrialized. Nowadays there are increasing concerns regarding the environment and animal welfare. A solution for concerned food buyers could be to buy organic products. The biggest barrier to buy organic meat is the price surplus. On average organic meat is 73 % more expensive. The transparency of this price surplus is unsatisfactory, it should be clearer what share favors the environment and animal welfare as this are the main marketing arguments. Improving this transparency is the main objective of this research. In this research mixed-methods are applied, both quantitative and qualitative data collection techniques are applied parallel. Quantitative data {{is used to calculate}} the cost price difference in the primary production and in the consumer price. Qualitative data is used explanatory to the price differences. A content analysis is made on regulations regarding organic production to explain the cost price gap in the primary production. Semi-structured interviews are conducted with experts in the industry to explain differences in the cost price caused more upstream in the supply chain. The cost price in the primary production is significantly higher in organic farming practices (75 % in pig farming, 102 % in poultry farming). The biggest cost difference occurs in the purchasing of organic animal feed, even though this is not solving a major abuse in terms of animal welfare. However, in absolute terms the majority of the difference in cost price is caused upstream the supply chain. As the conventional and organic meat supply chain are completely separated and independent of each other they are designed as a <b>dual</b> supply <b>chain.</b> The <b>dual</b> supply <b>chain</b> model causes an increase of the costs mainly due to the small volume that flows through the chain, this disables the opportunity to gain scale advantages. In the same vein other drawbacks of the <b>dual</b> supply <b>chain</b> which affect the cost price are distinguished. Bionext ‘the Dutch umbrella organisation for organic farming and food’ markets organic meat with the statement: “the price difference enables the farmer to take better care of the animals and the environment”.

They are producing meat which is positioned in between conventional and organic in terms of regulations, but operate in a single supply chain, which results in a decrease of the cost price.

Starting {{from the}} seminal work {{introducing}} Alternating Tem-poral Logic, formalisms for strategic reasoning have assumed {{a prominent role in}} multi-agent systems verification. Among the others, Strategy Logic (SL) allows to represent sophisticated solution concepts, by treating agent strategies as first-order objects. A drawback from the high power of SL is to admit non-behavioral strate-gies: a choice of an agent, at a given point of a play, may depend on choices other agents can make in the future or in counterfactual plays. As the latter moves are unpredictable, such strategies cannot be easily implemented, making the use of the logic problematic in practice. In this paper, we describe a hierarchy of SL fragments as syntactic re-strictions of the recently defined Boolean-Goal Strategy Logic (SL[bg]).

We demonstrate this property on a series of dual and single chain biosensors, which report the localization of Rac 1 and RhoA activity, whilst performing concomitant ratiometric FRET analysis on the acquired FLIM data by the generalized polarization (GP) approach. We then evaluate and compare the ability of these two methods to quantitatively image biosensor FRET signal as a function of time and space. We find that with lifetime analysis in the phasor plot each molecular species is transformed into a two-dimensional coordinate system where independent mixtures of fluorophores can be distinguished from changes in lifetime due to FRET. This enables the fractional contribution of the free and bound state of a <b>dual</b> <b>chain</b> biosensor or the low and high FRET species of a single chain biosensor to be quantified in each pixel of an image. The physical properties intrinsic to each biosensor design are also accurately characterized by the phasor analysis; thus, this method could be used to inform biosensor optimization at the developmental stage.

40|$|Systematic {{analysis}} of a grid of 3450 km of multichannel seismic reflection lines from the Solomon Islands constrains the late Tertiary sedimentary and tectonic history of the Solomon Island arc and its convergent interaction with the Cretaceous Ontong Java oceanic plateau (OJP). The OJP, the largest oceanic plateau on Earth, subducted beneath {{the northern edge of}} the Solomon arc in the late Neogene, but the timing and consequences of this obliquely convergent event and its role in the subduction polarity reversal process remain poorly constrained. The Central Solomon intra-arc basin (CSB), which developed in Oligocene to Recent time above the Solomon arc, provides a valuable record of the tectonic environment prior to and accompanying the OJP convergent event and the subsequent arc polarity reversal. Recognition of regionally extensive stratigraphic sequences—whose ages can be inferred from marine sedimentary sections exposed onland in the Solomon Islands—indicate four distinct tectonic phases affecting the Solomon Island arc. Phase 1 : Late Oligocene–Late Miocene rifting of the northeast-facing Solomon Island arc produced basal, normal-fault-controlled, asymmetrical sequences of the CSB; the proto-North Solomon trench was probably much closer to the CSB and is inferred to coincide with the trace of the present-day Kia-Kaipito-Korigole (KKK) fault zone; this protracted period of intra-arc extension shows no evidence for interruption by an early Miocene period of convergent “soft docking” of the Ontong Java Plateau as proposed by previous workers. Phase 2 : Late Miocene–Pliocene oblique convergence of the Ontong Java Plateau at the proto-North Solomon trench (KKK fault zone) and folding of the CSB and formation of the Malaita accretionary prism (MAP); the highly oblique and diachronous convergence between the Ontong Java plateau and the Solomon arc terminates intra-arc extension first in the southeast (Russell subbasin of the CSB) during the Late Miocene and later during the Pliocene in the northwest (Shortland subbasin of the CSB); folds in the CSB form by inversion of normal faults formed during Phase 1; Phinney et al. [Sequence stratigraphy, structural style, and age of deformation of the Malaita accretionary prism (Solomon arc-Ontong Java Plateau convergent zone) ] show a coeval pattern of southeast to northwest younging in folding and faulting of the MAP. Phase 3 : Late Pliocene–early Pleistocene arc polarity reversal and subduction initiation at the San Cristobal trench. Effects of this event in the CSB include the formation of a chain of volcanoes above the subducting Australia plate at the San Cristobal trench, the formation of the broad synclinal structure of the CSB with evidence for truncation at the uplifted flanks, and widespread occurrence of slides and “seismites” (deposits formed by seismic shaking).

So the discretized problem can be cast in a circuit-like manner. The proposed method is formulated in terms of mesh currents on a triangulated surface in order to reduce computing requirements compared to edge element formulations. The basic idea is to use homology generators of the triangulated surface to compute the additional cochains needed by mesh analysis...|$|R
40|$|The {{development}} of chimpanzee behavior on a four-component, three-lever multiple schedule is described. Component schedules included the Sidman avoidance procedure with a concurrent discriminated avoidance schedule {{on a second}} lever, fixed ratio performance for food, differential reinforcement of low rate for water requiring a <b>dual</b> response <b>chain,</b> and a symbol discrimination task for continuous food reinforcement using three levers. The avoidance component of this schedule was employed during the January 31, 1961 suborbital space flight of the chimpanzee “Ham. ” On November 29, 1961, the chimpanzee “Enos” performed on the multiple schedule during three orbits around the earth in a Mercury capsule...|$|R

These businesses are the main entities of a network called <b>dual</b> channel supply <b>chain.</b> Improving customer service {{as one of the}} main performance measures has got a growing interest in recent years from all entities of supply chain specifically manufacturing/service providers. In this context, we can express customer service as 2 ̆ 2 being able to satisfy customer demands as soon as possible 2 ̆ 2 and from the manufacturer 2 ̆ 7 s point of view, it is potentially achievable by coordination of scheduling and reliable due date quotation. In this dissertation, we consider due date quotation problem coordinated with scheduling in a two-echelon <b>dual</b> channel supply <b>chain</b> from the manufacturer point of view. We study three main problems...|$|R

Examples {{are given to}} show how such paired representations are powerful aids in understanding the dynamics associated with shell-model coupling schemes and in identifying the physical situations for which a given scheme is most appropriate. In particular, they suggest model Hamiltonians that are diagonal in the various coupling schemes. The dual pairing of group representations has been applied profitably in mathematics {{to the study of}} invariant theory. We show that parallel applications to the theory of symmetry and dynamical groups in physics are equally valuable. In particular, the pairing of the representations of a discrete group with those of a continuous Lie group or those of a compact Lie with those of a non-compact Lie group makes it possible to infer many properties of difficult groups from those of simpler groups. This review starts with the representations of the symmetric and unitary groups, which are used extensively in the many-particle quantum mechanics of bosonic and fermionic systems. It gives a summary of the many solutions and computational techniques for solving problems that arise in applications of symmetry methods in physics and which result from the famous Schur-Weyl duality theorem for the pairing of these representations. It continues to examine many chains of symmetry groups and <b>dual</b> <b>chains</b> of dynamical groups associated with the several coupling schemes in atomic and nuclear shell models and the valuable insights {{and applications}} that result from this examination.
