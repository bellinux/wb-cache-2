40|$|Ketoprofen and {{piketoprofen}} are non-steroi-dal antiinflamatory drugs (NSAIDs) {{from the}} group of the aryl-propionic acid derivatives. They are widely used in topical presentations {{in the management of}} musculoskeletal rheuma-tisms and traumatisms. The advantage of this form of administration is, besides its commo-dity, the infrequent development of systemic adverse effects. There have been reports of cases of contact dermatitis and photodermatitis, the latter particularly in countries of the Medite-rranean area or in countries with a greater sun-light exposure 1 - 10. We present the case of a young girl who atten-ded our Paediatric Allergy outpatient clinic des-cribing the development of three marked local reactions after the use of dermatologic gels con-taining these NSAIDs in their formulations. CLINICAL OBSERVATION The patient was a 14 -year-old girl, whose only relevant personal antecedent was the presence of atopic dermatitis some years earlier. She came to our Paediatric Allergy outpatient clinic because she had first developed, after the application of Fas-tum ¨ gel (ethyl alcohol, carbomer, diethanolami-ne, <b>essence</b> <b>of</b> <b>lavender,</b> methyl p-hydroxybenzoa-te, propyl p-hydroxybenzoate and ketoprofen) on her knee because of a traumatism, and after expo-sure to sunlight, erythema, oedema, local hypert-hermia and small macular lesions with pruritus and burning in the area of application. She was initially treated with antihistamines and a topical corticoste-roid, with moderate improvement. Treatment was thereupon instituted with oral 6 -methyl-prednisolo-ne, and the lesions remitted in 20 days. Som...|$|E

40|$|Introduction: Lavandula angustifolia (lavender) is an {{aromatic}} evergreen of laminacea {{family with}} some medicinal characteristics. The effect <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> aqueous extract on improving learning and memory in Alzheimeric model of animals has been proved. Reduced acetylcholine {{due to increased}} activity of acetylcholine esterase {{is one of the}} main symptoms of Alzheimer's disease. This research was accomplished in order to evaluate the anti-acetylcholine esterase activity of the aqueous extract <b>of</b> <b>lavender.</b> Meanwhile, the toxic effect of the herbal medicine on hepatic HepG 2 cell line was considered. Materials and Methods: The dried flowers <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> were mixed with boiled water and then evaporated. In this experimental study the acetylcholine esterase inhibitory activity <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> was assessed using Ellman's colorimetric method in 96 well microplates at 405 nm. Also the toxicity effect <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> was evaluated on HepG 2 cell line. Results: Comparing the results taken from the treated and untreated solutions showed that the aqueous extract <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> did not affect efficiently the acetylcholine esterase inhibitory activity. Also the microscopic evaluation of the HepG 2 cells indicated no granulation of the treated cells compared with the untreated cells; confirming that the aqueous extract <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> has no toxic effect on the HepG 2 cell line. Conclusion: The aqueous extract <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> is not affected impressively the acetylcholine esterase activity and also is not toxic to the hepatic cells...|$|R
50|$|Originally, {{the name}} {{lavender}} only applied to flowers. By 1930, the book A Dictionary of Color identified three major shades <b>of</b> lavender—floral <b>lavender,</b> lavender gray, and lavender blue, {{and in addition}} a fourth shade <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> called old lavender (a dark lavender gray) (all four of these shades <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> are shown below). By 1955, {{the publication of the}} ISCC-NBS Dictionary of Color Names (a color dictionary used by stamp collectors to identify the colors of stamps), now on the Internet, listed dozens of different shades <b>of</b> <b>lavender.</b> Today, although the color floral <b>lavender</b> (the color <b>of</b> the flower <b>of</b> the <b>lavender</b> plant) remains the standard for lavender, just as there are many shades of pink (light red, light rose, and light magenta colors), there are many shades <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> (some light magenta, some light purple, mostly light violet well as some grayish violet, and some light indigo colors).|$|R

40|$|Introduction: Lavender (Lavandula angustifolia) is {{commonly}} used in household products, perfumes, aromatherapy and complementary medicines. This study assesses the effects <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> and its component linalool on neurotransmission and contraction of smooth muscle. Methods: The concentration-dependent effects <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> (0. 001 % to 0. 05 %) and linalool (0. 001 % to 0. 05 %) on electrically evoked nerve terminal impulse (NTI) and excitatory junction current (EJC) amplitudes were assessed, while the effects <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> (0. 03 %) and linalool (0. 03 %) on 5 -hydroxytryptamine, acetylcholine, histamine, noradrenaline and oxytocin evoked responses were examined. Reversibility <b>of</b> <b>lavender</b> (0. 03 %) and linalool (0. 03 %) effects on electrically evoked NTI and EJC amplitudes, {{as well as on}} acetylcholine evoked contractile responses, were also analysed. Results: Lavender and linalool caused concentration-dependent decreases of electrically evoked NTI and EJC amplitudes, and attenuated the contractile responses towards 5 -hydroxytryptamine, acetylcholine, histamine, noradrenaline and oxytocin. Repeated washing of tissues treated with lavender following pre-treatment with acetylcholine reversed the inhibitory effects <b>of</b> <b>lavender,</b> whereas linalool's effects were not readily reversible. Conclusion: Lavender and linalool may cause inhibition of smooth muscle presynaptic action potential propagation and postsynaptic G-protein coupled receptor evoked responses. Full Tex...|$|R
