40|$|ABSTRACTThe Problem: Ku Cenneti National Park is {{a unique}} {{environment}} because of the species it supports andbecause of its functions in the ecosystem. However, there has been pollution and deterioration in the parklately and <b>industrialists</b> in Band?rma were blamed for the degradation. There has been {{a gap in the}} BAUconservation literature as no single study has dealt with the issue previously. Purpose of the Study: Therefore, this study is an attempt to evaluate the blames and illuminate the perception of <b>industrialists</b> on national park and on nature protection in general. How have <b>industrialists</b> perceive nature protection programs? What are their answers for the blames? Are they really insensitive to nature protection? What are some of the difficulties they face in an environment that has vital habitat for wild life?Methodology: To answer these questions a fieldwork was conducted in the area, some <b>industrialists</b> and representatives of Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs) were asked to express their opinion. Fieldwork is used as main methodology and field observations have been done in the area in a period extending over a year. Findings and Results: The study showed that despite their awareness for environmental pollution and degradation a number of obstacles prevent them from making investments that are environment friendly. It will be an incomplete approach to blame the all problems of the national park on <b>industrialists.</b> However, likewise it would be wrong for <b>industrialists</b> {{to take advantage of this}} view and blame on other institutions, sectors, social and administrative processes. This approach might be a key concept for a more sustainable development. Recommendations: The <b>industrialists</b> should be approached without prejudice and the ones who are willing to pay for the environment should be subsidized. Conservation planning should be done in a more participatory way and <b>industrialists</b> should involve in the planning processes...|$|R
