The original was a [...] high bronze piece created between 1879 and 1889, designed for the Gates lintel, from which the figure would gaze down upon Hell. While The Thinker most obviously characterizes Dante, aspects of the Biblical Adam, the mythological Prometheus, and Rodin himself have been ascribed to him. Other observers de-emphasize the apparent intellectual theme of The Thinker, stressing the figure's rough physicality and the <b>emotional</b> <b>tension</b> emanating from it.|$|E
500|$|Cementing the low of {{his career}} was the death of {{publicist}} George Evans {{from a heart attack}} in January 1950 at 48. According to Jimmy Van Heusen, Sinatra's close friend and songwriter, Evans's death to him was [...] "an enormous shock which defies words", as he had been crucial to his career and popularity with the bobbysoxers. Sinatra's reputation continued to decline as reports broke out in February of his affair with Ava Gardner and the destruction of his marriage to Nancy, though he insisted that his marriage had long been over even before he had met Gardner. In April, Sinatra was engaged to perform at the Copa club in New York, but had to cancel five days of the booking due to suffering a submucosal hemorrhage of the throat. Evans once noted that whenever Sinatra suffered from a bad throat and loss of voice it was always due to <b>emotional</b> <b>tension</b> which [...] "absolutely destroyed him".|$|E
500|$|After the Harlem Riot of 1935 caused {{widespread}} destruction, La Guardia {{ordered a}} commission to pinpoint its underlying causes. He appointed the historian E. Franklin Frazier {{as head of the}} commission, who wrote that [...] "economic and social forces created a state of <b>emotional</b> <b>tension</b> which sought release upon the slightest provocation". The report listed several [...] "economic and social forces" [...] that worked against blacks, including discrimination in employment and city services, overcrowding in housing, and police brutality. Specifically, it criticized New York City Police Commissioner Lewis Joseph Valentine and New York City Hospitals Commissioner Sigismund S. Goldwater, both of whom responded with criticisms of the report. Conflicted, La Guardia asked academic Alain LeRoy Locke to analyze both accounts and assess the situation. Locke wrote confidentially to La Guardia that Valentine was blameworthy and listed several areas for immediate improvement, such as health and education. Publicly, Locke published an article in the Survey Graphic which blamed the 1935 riot on the state of affairs in New York that La Guardia inherited.|$|E

While still with Big Records as a duo, Simon released a solo single, [...] "True or False", under the name [...] "True Taylor". This recording upset Garfunkel, who regarded it as a betrayal; the <b>emotional</b> <b>tension</b> from that incident occasionally surfacing throughout their relationship. Their last recording with Big Records was a cover of a Jan and Dean single, [...] "Baby Talk", but the company became bankrupt soon after release; the track was reissued on Bell Records, but failed to sell, so Tom & Jerry was dissolved.

500|$|Through a Glass Darkly is a long, complex {{narrative}} that {{features more than}} 60 characters and at least 15 subplots. The title of the novel comes from the Bible verse 1 Corinthians 13. Before she began writing it, Koen envisioned creating {{a story about the}} relationship between a young woman and an older man, a plot element riddled with <b>emotional</b> <b>tension</b> that required much planning and foresight. Koen also sought to create a story that featured issues relevant to contemporary women, such as the non-existence of [...] "legal rights. If a husband wanted to beat his wife to death he could do it, and if her parents didn't care... No birth control. If you had any normal sexual urges you were pregnant all the time, and half the women died in childbirth. Life was very violent and short and I just wanted to show how it was without getting up on a soapbox, so someone reading it would say, 'I'm glad I live now.'" [...] According to Koen, another consistent theme throughout Through a Glass Darkly is how vital family is to our well-being, family in this case being a loose term that does not necessarily equate to being biologically-related. She was also interested in writing how people are connected to each other.|$|E
2500|$|Affective action (also {{known as}} {{emotional}} actions): actions which are taken due to 'one's emotions, to express personal feelings. For examples, cheering after a victory, crying {{at a funeral}} would be affective actions. [...] Affective {{is divided into two}} subgroups: uncontrolled reaction and <b>emotional</b> <b>tension.</b> [...] In uncontrolled reaction there is no restraint and there is lack of discretion. [...] A person with an uncontrolled reaction becomes less inclined to consider other peoples’ feelings as much as their own. [...] <b>Emotional</b> <b>tension</b> comes from a basic belief that a person is unworthy or powerless to obtain his/her deepest aspirations. [...] When aspirations are not fulfilled there is internal unrest. [...] It is often difficult to be productive in society because of the unfulfilled life. Emotion is often neglected because of concepts at the core of exchange theory. A common example is behavioral and rational choice assumptions. From the behavioral view, emotions are often inseparable from punishments.|$|E

There's little pathos or <b>emotional</b> <b>tension.</b> There is also scarcely a moment of humour [...] lyrics are prosaic, and the flickers of light relief are merely confusing."

50|$|Le Rouge et le Noir {{is set in}} {{the latter}} years of the Bourbon Restoration (1814-30) and the days of the 1830 July Revolution that {{established}} the Kingdom of the French (1830-48). Julien Sorel’s worldly ambitions are motivated by the <b>emotional</b> <b>tensions,</b> between his idealistic Republicanism and his nostalgic allegiance to Napoleon, and the realistic politics of counter-revolutionary conspiracy, by Jesuit-supported legitimists, notably the Marquis de la Mole, whom Julien serves, for personal gain. Presuming a knowledgeable reader, the novelist Stendhal only alludes to the historical background of Le Rouge et le Noir—yet did sub-title it Chronique de 1830 (“Chronicle of 1830”). Moreover, the reader wishing an exposé of the same historical background might wish to read Lucien Leuwen (1834), one of Stendhal’s un-finished novels, posthumously published in 1894.|$|R

The experiences and mindset of entrepreneurs setting {{up and running}} such enterprises require better understanding. Using data from a qualitative study of 23 online home-based business entrepreneurs, we propose the augmented concept of ‘mental mobility’ to encapsulate how they approach their business activities. Drawing on Howard P. Becker's early theorising of mobility, together with Victor Turner's later notion of liminality, we conceptualise mental mobility as the process through which individuals navigate the liminal spaces between the physical and digital spheres of work and the overlapping home/workplace, enabling them to manipulate and partially reconcile the spatial, temporal and <b>emotional</b> <b>tensions</b> that are present in such work environments. Our research also holds important applications for alternative employment contexts and broader social orderings because of the increasingly pervasive and disruptive influence of technology on experiences of remunerated work...|$|R

40|$|Graduation date: 2011 Not {{only does}} the {{publication}} of Ovidian adaptations online increase public awareness of Ovid, but it also offers new material for research and pedagogical purposes. Consequently, in this thesis, I explore both the historical tradition of Ovidian adaptations, specifically adaptations of Ovid's Orpheus tale, and the modern presentation of Ovidian Adaptations online. In {{the first half of}} the thesis, I trace the thematic connections between historical and modern adaptations of Ovid's Orpheus myth. My analysis reveals that despite changes in form and medium, from printed poems to Internet video games, Ovidian adaptations return to Ovid's distinct thematic emphasis on exploring human passions and expressing an individual's <b>emotional</b> <b>tensions</b> through art. In the second half of the thesis, I focus on the pedagogical implications of locating Ovidian adaptations on the public space of the Internet. I contend that online adaptations offer educators the possibility of showing students interpretive models and of making student knowledge and experience central to learning in the classroom...|$|R

In his Autobiography he wrote, [...] "the life of every man is an endlessly repeated performance {{of the life of}} man...". He also expressed his feeling that our deeds on Earth constitute [...] "a myth which we act almost without knowing it."
