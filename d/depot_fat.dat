50|$|Pristanic acid (2,6,10,14-tetramethylpentadecanoic acid) is a terpenoid acid {{present at}} micromolar {{concentrations}} in the blood plasma of healthy individuals. It {{is also found in}} the lipids from many sources such as freshwater sponges, krill, earthworms, whales, human milk fat, bovine <b>depot</b> <b>fat,</b> butterfat or Californian petroleum. It is usually present in combination with phytanic acid. In humans, pristanic acid is obtained from two sources: either directly from the diet or as the alpha oxidation product of phytanic acid. At physiological concentrations pristanic acid is a natural ligand for PPARα. In liver, pristanic acid is degraded by peroxisomal beta oxidation to propionyl-CoA. Together with phytanic acid, pristanic acid accumulates in several inherited disorders such as Zellweger syndrome.|$|E
50|$|Excess {{carbohydrates}} in {{the body}} are converted to palmitic acid. Palmitic acid is the first fatty acid produced during fatty acid synthesis and is the precursor to longer fatty acids. As a consequence, palmitic acid is a major body component of animals. In humans, one analysis found it to make up 21-30% (molar) of human <b>depot</b> <b>fat,</b> {{and it is a}} major, but highly variable, lipid component of human breast milk. Palmitate negatively feeds back on acetyl-CoA carboxylase (ACC), which is responsible for converting acetyl-CoA to malonyl-CoA, which in turn is used to add to the growing acyl chain, thus preventing further palmitate generation. In biology, some proteins are modified by the addition of a palmitoyl group in a process known as palmitoylation. Palmitoylation is important for membrane localisation of many proteins.|$|E

40|$|During the {{finishing}} phase of bovines, {{large amounts of}} subcutaneous and visceral fats are deposited leading to production inefficiencies with major impact on meat quality. A {{better understanding of the}} cellularity features of the main <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> could provide strategies for adipose tissue manipulation. This study assessed the effect of feeding diets with distinct forage to concentrate ratios on the cellularity of two <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> of beef cattle and their implications on the fatty acid profile. Thus, two phylogenetically distant Portuguese bovine breeds, Alentejana and Barros&# 227;, were selected. The results did not show differences in subcutaneous fat deposition nor in visceral <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> partitioning. Plasma adipokines concentration failed to show a consistent relationship with fatness, as leptin remained constant in all experimental groups, whereas interleukin- 6 was influenced by breed. <b>Fat</b> <b>depot</b> seems to determine the area and number of adipocytes, with larger adipocytes and a lower number of cells in subcutaneous fat than in mesenteric fat. Neither breed nor diet influenced adipocytes area and number. The contents of total fatty acids, partial sums of fatty acids and conjugated linoleic acid isomeric profile were affected by breed and <b>fat</b> <b>depot.</b> The incorporation of saturated fatty acids (SFA), trans fatty acids, polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFA) and branched chain fatty acids (BCFA) was higher in mesenteric <b>fat</b> <b>depot,</b> whereas subcutaneous <b>fat</b> <b>depot</b> had greater percentages of monounsaturated fatty acids (MUFA). In addition, SFA and MUFA proportions seem to be breed-related. In spite of the less relevant role of diet, the percentages of PUFA and BCFA were influenced by this factor.

In Experiment 1, total body fat, carcass fat (total body fat minus abdominal fat), and abdominal fat (AF) were determined. In Experiment 2, several separable <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> (abdominal, neck, sartorial, and mesenteric fat) were removed and weighed.

40|$|ABSTRACT. We {{previously}} reported {{the presence of}} brown/beige adipocytes in the white <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> of mature cattle. The present study exam-ined the effects of dietary vitamin A on the expression of brown/beige adipocyte-related genes in the white <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> of fattening cattle. No significant differences were observed in the expression of Ucp 1 between vitamin A-deficient cattle and control cattle. However, {{the expression of the}} other brown/beige adipocyte-related genes was slightly higher in the mesenteric <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> of vitamin A-deficient cattle. The present results suggest that a vitamin A deficiency does not markedly affect the expression of Ucp 1 in white <b>fat</b> <b>depots,</b> but imply that it may stimulate the emergence of beige adipocytes in the mesenteric <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> of fattening cattle.

40|$|Animals metabolically route {{specific}} macronutrients {{from their}} diet {{to build and}} maintain tissue and researchers generally assume that the isotopic composition of an animal 2 ̆ 7 s tissues resembles the isotopic composition of their diet. However, animals regularly change diets and they may route dietary macronutrients differently to specific tissues. Thus, I studied metabolic routing of dietary macronutrients into animal tissue because it is fundamentally important for understanding the nutritional ecology of wild vertebrates and because such knowledge is essential for accurate interpretation of stable isotope patterns in consumers and consumed. ^ Songbirds that routinely switch their diets during migration provide a particularly interesting system in which to study these fundamental issues. Fruits with more carbohydrates and less protein may be sufficient to rebuild expended fat stores, but such fruits may be inadequate to replace protein stores catabolized during migration. I used differences between the isotopic signatures of breath, blood and feathers sampled from free-living birds to identify changes in their diet during fall migration. I also used stable isotopes of carbon and nitrogen to investigate macronutrient routing in Yellow-rumped Warblers (Dendroica coronata), a common migratory songbird in coastal New England. ^ Using feeding trials combined with concentration-dependent mixing models, I determined that birds fed high- or low-protein diets metabolically routed carbon from multiple dietary macronutrients into proteinaceous tissue, whereas birds metabolically routed nitrogen only from dietary protein sources into proteinaceous tissue. I also determined that δ 13 C of <b>depot</b> <b>fat</b> in birds depended on the concentration and isotopic signatures of the dietary lipid and carbohydrate. δ 13 C of <b>depot</b> <b>fat</b> in birds synthesized from dietary carbohydrate was 4 ‰ depleted relative to δ 13 C of dietary carbohydrate, whereas δ 13 C of <b>depot</b> <b>fat</b> in birds synthesized from dietary lipid was similar to δ 13 C of dietary lipid.

Methodology/Principal Findings: Fat tissues were collected from 16 Hereford 6 Aberdeen Angus cross bred steers (15. 5 month old) fed a high-fat diet (5. 85 % fat, n = 8) or control diet (1. 95 % fat, n = 8). Total RNA from each animal was subjected to miRNA microarray analysis using a customized Agilent miRNA microarray containing 672 bovine miRNA probes. Expression of miRNAs was not equal between <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> as well as diets: 207 miRNAs were detected in both <b>fat</b> <b>depots,</b> while 37 of these {{were found to be}} tissue specific; and 169 miRNAs were commonly expressed under two diets while 75 were diet specific. The number of miRNAs detected per animal fed the high fat diet was higher than those fed control diet (p = 0. 037 in subcutaneous fat and p = 0. 002 visceral fat).

Subcutaneous and visceral fat tissues were collected from 16 British-continental steers (15. 5 month old) fed a high-fat diet (7. 1 % fat, n= 8) or a control diet (2. 7 % fat, n= 8). Protein expression was profiled using label free quantification LC-MS/MS and expression of selected transcripts was evaluated using qRT-PCR. A total of 682 proteins were characterized and quantified with <b>fat</b> <b>depot</b> having more impact on protein expression, altering the level of 51. 0 % of the detected proteins, whereas diet affected only 5. 3 %. Functional analysis revealed that energy production and lipid metabolism were among the main functions associated with differentially expressed proteins between <b>fat</b> <b>depots,</b> with visceral <b>fat</b> being more metabolically active than subcutaneous fat as proteins associated with lipid and energy metabolism were upregulated.

Necropsy of 28 animals provided information on residue concentrations in 35 tissues, and the excretion in milk was determined in 15 animals. These studies showed that the major brominated biphenyls of this commercial mixture were absorbed from the gastrointestinal tract and appeared in the blood plasma within 4 hr. With continued exposure to the residue plasma concentrations reached a steady state by 15 days. Free PBB was not detectable in urine. During PBB feeding feces was the major route of excretion, representing approximately 50 % of the amount fed to animals not displaying signs of toxicosis. Following a withdrawal of PBB, fecal concentrations declined to 1 to 2 % of concentrations during dosing, yet, feces remained the major excretory route in nonlactating animals. In contrast, in post-exposure lactating animals milk fat became an important excretory route removing three-times the quantity of residue cleared in feces. Following parturition, concentrations of PBB in milk fat declined approximately twofold in 6 days.

The origin of embolic fat (bone marrow or <b>depot</b> <b>fat</b> versus plasma lipoproteins) has been debated. To test the hypothesis that alterations in the composition of plasma very-low-density lipoproteins (VLDL) could lead to their coalescence and subsequent impaction in pulmonary vasculature, New Zealand white rabbits were injected intramuscularly with 25 mg of cortisone twice a day for 2, 4, 6, 11 and 12 days. Blood samples were obtained from unanesthetized animals prior to the cortisone treatment and at sacrifice. Pulmonary fat embolism that was similar histologically to that found in the human patient with the clinical syndrome was produced in all rabbits treated for 4 - 12 days. After the fourth day, all animals were hyperlipidemic. There was a tenfold increase in plasma VLDL concentration and the mean particle diameter of the VLDL was increased from 620 Å to 1016 Å. The proportion of triglyceride (TG) was increased, protein (PR) and phospholipid (PL) were decreased and total cholesterol (TC) was unaltered (untreated controls: PR, 16. 4 %; TG, 58. 5 %; PL, 19. 2 %; TC, 6. 7 % and cortisone-treated: PR, 8. 4 %; TG, 75. 1 %; PL, 11 %; TC, 6. 4 %). The lipid composition of pulmonary embolic fat from rabbits treated with cortisone for 6 or 11 days was TG, 81 %; PL, 13 % and TC, 6 %. VLDL from similarly treated rabbits had a lipid composition of TG, 79 %; PL, 14. 5 % and TC, 6. 6 %. The TC concentration of bone marrow and <b>depot</b> <b>fat</b> from animals treated with cortisone for 11 days was < 1 %, and the PL concentration was < 2 %. These data support the hypothesis that plasma lipoproteins, primarily the VLDL, when altered in size and composition can coalesce into globules of sufficient size to occlude peripheral capillaries...|$|E

Animal study findings have revealed that individual <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> are not functionally equivalent and have different embryonic origins depending on the anatomic location. Mouse bone regeneration studies have also shown that {{it is essential to}} match theHox code of transplanted cells and host tissues to achieve correct repair. However, subcutaneous <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> from any donor site are often used in autologous fat grafting. Our study was thus carried out to determine the embryonic origins of human facial (chin) and limb (knee) <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> and whether they had similar features and molecular matching patterns. Paired chin and knee <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> were harvested from 11 subjects and gene expression profiles were determined by DNAmicroarray analyses. Adipose-derived stromal cells (ASCs) from both sites were isolated and analyzed for their capacity to proliferate, form clones, and differentiate. Chin and knee <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> expressed a differentHOX code and could have different embryonic origins. ASCs displayed a different phenotype, with chin-ASCs having the potential to differentiate into brown-like adipocytes, whereas knee-ASCs differentiated into white adipocytes. These results highlighted different features for these two fat sites and indicated that donor site selection might be an important factor to be considered when applying adipose tissue in cell-based therapies. 1...|$|R
2500|$|Marrow fat, [...] {{also known}} as marrow adipose tissue (MAT), is a poorly {{understood}} adipose depot that resides in the bone and is interspersed with hematopoietic cells as well as bony elements. The adipocytes in this depot are derived from mesenchymal stem cells (MSC) which can give rise to fat cells, bone cells {{as well as other}} cell types. [...] The fact that MAT increases in the setting of calorie restriction/ anorexia is a feature that distinguishes this <b>depot</b> from other <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> Exercise regulates MAT, decreasing MAT quantity and diminishing the size of marrow adipocytes. [...] The exercise regulation of marrow fat suggests that it bears some physiologic similarity to other white adipose depots. [...] Moreover, increased MAT in obesity further suggests a similarity to white <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b>|$|R

Indeed, fat cell numbers actually increase in certain <b>fat</b> <b>depots</b> between middle and old age (6 – 8). Fifteen to 50 percent of cells in fat are preadipocytes (9). Preadipocyte abundance increases or remains constant with aging in dif-ferent <b>fat</b> <b>depots.</b> Preadipocyte replication and differentia-tion decline with aging at different rates among depots (10 – 14).
