The routes slowly becomes commercial once again, passing a large <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> before entering an at-grade interchange with CR574 (Jamison Road). Before 1980, this intersection served as the western terminus of NY422. After CR574, NY16, NY78 and CR572 continue northwest along Seneca Street as a two-lane residential roadway through Elma. Bending northwest, the routes enter the hamlet of Spring Brook, where it intersects with CR140 (Rice Road) and CR362 (North Davis Road).|$|E
5|$|In January 1851, Allen {{purchased}} the Eagle flour mills, an historically important <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> in the area, which eventually gave the hamlet of Eagle Mills its name. The factory {{had a long}} history of failed business attempts. It was built in 1821 by Daniel Sheldon to mill flour using wheat supplied from Troy. After brief success, the business closed and the building sat idle. It was sold to James Bumstead who reopened the building as a feed mill. He too had troubles and sold the building to James McChesney, who kept the building idle for some time before transferring the property to Catlin and Saxton, who began the manufacture of augers and bits. Also unsuccessful, Catlin and Saxton abandoned the business and James McChesney (whose name was still on the deed) sold the property to Groome and Shattuck, who began manufacturing monkey wrenches. This too failed and the property was sold to Paul Smith, a miller from nearby Cropseyville, who sold the property to Allen in 1851 because Smith later decided that he preferred to keep his mills consolidated in Cropseyville.|$|E
5|$|Jeffrey again visits Dorothy's {{apartment}} {{and she tells}} him that although she knows nothing about him, she has been yearning for him. Jeffrey attends another of Dorothy's performances at the club, where she sings the same song. At the club, Jeffrey spots Frank in the audience fondling a piece of blue velvet fabric he cut from Dorothy's robe. Jeffrey follows Frank and spends {{the next few days}} spying on him. Shortly afterwards, two men that Jeffrey calls the Well-Dressed Man and the Yellow Man exit an <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> that Frank frequently visits. Jeffrey concludes the men are criminal associates of Frank, and tells his new findings to Sandy. The two briefly kiss, though she feels uncomfortable about going any further. Jeffrey immediately visits Dorothy again, and the two have sex. However, when he refuses to hit her, she pressures him, becoming more emotional. In a blind rage he knocks her backwards and is instantly horrified, but Dorothy derives pleasure from it.|$|E

5|$|Since the {{economic}} crisis of 2009, which gutted many of London's manufacturing jobs, the city has transitioned to become a technology hub {{with a focus on}} the Digital Creative sector. As of 2016, London is home to 300 technology companies and employs 3% of the city's labour force. Many of these companies have moved into former factories and industrial spaces located in and around the downtown core, and have renovated them as modern offices. For example, Info-Tech Research Group's London office is located in a hosiery factory, and Arcane Digital moved into a 1930s <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> in 2015. rTraction, a digital media firm, currently has its offices in the London Roundhouse, a steam locomotive repair shop built in 1887. Its redesign, which opened in 2015, won the 2015 Paul Oberman Award for Adaptive Re-Use from the Architectural Conservancy of Ontario. London is also home to Diply, which is ranked among the top websites on the Internet, video game companies Big Viking Games and Digital Extremes, and Voices.com, which provides voiceover artists a platform to advertise and sell their services to those looking for voiceover work.|$|E
5|$|The most {{significant}} {{change to the}} district is the extension on the southeast, to the boundary of the city's Eighth Ward in 1870. Between Adams and Ferry streets, three blocks would be added, with the new boundary following {{the west side of}} St. Mary's Avenue, excluding a newer house at the northwest corner of the Washington Avenue intersection, and then rear property lines to Kennedy Lane and Hill Street just south of Adams. Two-story rowhouses predominate in this area, many built as worker housing during the 19th century, some as early as the Federal period. Some have intact storefronts. It also has the only significant <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> in the proposed expanded district, the former Lusco Paper Works on the northwest corner of Fifth and Liberty streets. The area has begun to see some restoration efforts, such as some Greek Revival rowhouses on Liberty Street near Fourth, which will benefit from state tax credits should the area be added to the district.|$|E

Outside, a large deck overlooks the Fort Point Channel and Boston Harbor and hosts the landmark Hood Milk Bottle.|$|E
25|$|In 1929, {{when the}} Dnieper Hydroelectric Station dam {{was already in}} place, the state {{announced}} a competition to design its generator building. Competition for an apparently insignificant <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> was elevated {{to the level of}} top state priority; competing drafts were displayed in the Moscow Kremlin. Floorplans and dimensions (nearly 200 meters long and 20 meters tall) were set in advance. Visually, the intended building was dominated by a taller and longer dam with its pattern of vertical buttresses.|$|E
50|$|The Policy of Revitalizing <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings</b> {{resulted}} {{in an increase in}} rental fees, the rateable value increased 2% in 2012 and 7% in 2013. A survey conducted in 2010 by the Hong Kong Arts Development Council (HKADC) showed that over 60% of <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings</b> users had problems as a result of rental increases. The average increase was 14%. According to the recent survey proposed by HKADC, among 800 arts groups renting space in <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings,</b> 61.5% stated that they were facing an increase in rental fee, which poses a financial threat to arts groups who have unstable income. Their rental fee, including cost of installing air conditioners and other equipment, accounts, for the largest part of their expenses. Some arts groups or arts practitioners choose to relocate from the old <b>industrial</b> <b>buildings</b> as a result.|$|R

25|$|The {{demolition}} {{of a house}} for military purposes is often undertaken {{in very different ways}} to conventional civilian demolitions. In peacetime situations, demolition is merely the first stage in a process that is usually intended to clear the ground for subsequent re-use (for instance, replacing an old building with a newer one or decommissioning an old <b>industrial</b> <b>building).</b> It is undertaken with extensive preparations, such as stripping the property of items of value, removing hazardous materials such as glass and asbestos insulation, and preparing the structure by removing features that might impede the demolition (such as internal partitions).|$|E
25|$|Italianate rowhouses so {{defined the}} {{neighborhood}} that the <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> at 50 Morton Avenue, {{on the western}} corner with Elizabeth Street, had its facade along that street done to mimic five rowhouses. The actual houses built during this era, however, began to break with the Greek Revival and Italianate traditions that had marked their pre-1870s neighbors. Their cornices {{were less likely to}} be carved ornately, and their facades featured more bay and oriel windows. Decorative touches characteristic of this era can be seen in the district on South Pearl. The building at 336 has Adamesque wreaths and other classically-inspired detailing while nearby 329 has intricately textured brickwork. Several others on the street have rock-faced lintels or semi-circular attic windows.|$|E
25|$|The first clubhouse (1865â73) was an {{existing}} house in Wynnewood, Pennsylvania, on land owned by Col. Owen Jones. The second (1873â80) was an <b>industrial</b> <b>building</b> in Ardmore, Pennsylvania, {{about a mile}} southeast of the current grounds. The third (1880â92), by Furness & Evans, on Cricket Avenue in Ardmore, was destroyed by fire in 1892. The fourth (1892â96), at the present location, although backing onto Montgomery Avenue, was destroyed by fire in January 1896. The fifth (1896), backing onto Grays Lane, was destroyed by fire before its completion. The sixth (and present) clubhouse was built to the same plan as the fifth, but in stone and brick. Alexander Cassatt, a vice-president of the Pennsylvania Railroad (later PRR president), paid for the fireproof clubhouse.|$|E
