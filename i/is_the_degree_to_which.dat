POS is generally {{thought to be the}} organization's contribution to a positive reciprocity dynamic with employees, as employees tend to perform better to reciprocate received rewards and favorable treatment. This idea bloomed from Eisenberger and Rhoades' organizational support theory.|$|E

Phi Beta Kappa, for example, was a true secret society, until after its secrets were divulged, the society continued on. It claims today to still be an actual society that has meetings, conducts its affairs, and is a living social entity, however membership for most members consists of one evening's initiation, and no more, which would make the society completely an honorary one in most people's eyes.|$|E

500|$|Within the brain, {{dopamine}} functions {{partly as}} a [...] "global reward signal", where an initial phasic dopamine response to a rewarding stimulus encodes information about the salience, value, and context of a reward. In the context of reward-related learning, dopamine also functions as a reward prediction error signal, that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> {{the value of a}} reward is unexpected. According to this hypothesis of Wolfram Schultz, rewards that are expected do not produce a second phasic dopamine response in certain dopaminergic cells, but rewards that are unexpected, or greater than expected, produce a short-lasting increase in synaptic dopamine, whereas the omission of an expected reward actually causes dopamine release to drop below its background level. The [...] "prediction error" [...] hypothesis has drawn particular interest from computational neuroscientists, because an influential computational-learning method known as temporal difference learning makes heavy use of a signal that encodes prediction error. This confluence of theory and data has led to a fertile interaction between neuroscientists and computer scientists interested in machine learning.|$|E
2500|$|Line {{regulation}} {{or input}} regulation <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> output voltage changes with input (supply) voltage changes - as {{a ratio of}} output to input change (for example, [...] "typically 13mV/V"), or the output voltage change over the entire specified input voltage range (for example, [...] "plus or minus 2% for input voltages between 90V and 260V, 50-60Hz").|$|E

Another factor increasing the effectiveness of placebos <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> a person attends to their symptoms, [...] "somatic focus". Individual variation in response to analgesic placebos has been linked to regional neurochemical differences in the internal affective state of the individuals experiencing pain.|$|E

50|$|An often {{overlooked}} contribution of Jeffery in his 1971 book is outlining four critical factors in crime prevention that have {{stood the test}} of time. These <b>are</b> <b>the</b> <b>degrees</b> <b>to</b> which one can manipulate the opportunity for a crime to occur, the motivation for the crime to occur, the risk to the offender if the crime occurs, and the history of the offender who might consider committing the crime.

2500|$|Most {{codes are}} largely voluntary. An issue {{raised in the}} U.S. since the 2005 Disney {{decision}} <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> companies manage their governance responsibilities; in other words, do they merely try to supersede the legal threshold, or should they create governance guidelines that ascend {{to the level of}} best practice.

2500|$|In {{personality}} psychology, {{locus of}} control <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> people {{believe that they have}} control over the outcome of events in their lives, as opposed to external forces beyond their control. Understanding of the concept was developed by Julian B. Rotter in 1954, and has since become an aspect of personality studies. A person's [...] "loci" [...] (plural of [...] "locus", Latin for [...] "place" [...] or [...] "location") are conceptualized as internal (a belief that one's life can be controlled) or external (a belief that life is controlled by outside factors which they cannot influence, or that chance or fate controls their lives).|$|E
30|$|The most {{frequently}} used statistical methods are known as frequentist (or classical) methods. These methods assume that unknown parameters <b>are</b> <b>the</b> fixed constants, and they define probability using limiting relative frequencies. Bayesian methods offer an alternative approach; they treat the parameters as random variables and define probability as “degrees of belief” (i.e., the probability of an event <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> believe <b>the</b> event <b>is</b> true). <b>The</b> term “Bayesian” comes from the prevalent usage of Bayes’ theorem, which <b>was</b> named after <b>the</b> Reverend Thomas Bayes, an eighteenth-century Presbyterian minister (Rathnayake 2010).|$|R

2500|$|Attachment in {{children}} is [...] "a biological instinct in which proximity to an attachment figure is sought {{when the child}} senses or perceives threat or discomfort.

Attachment also describes the function of availability, which <b>is</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> the authoritative figure is responsive to the child's needs and shares communication with them. Childhood attachment can define characteristics that will shape the child's sense of self, their forms of emotion-regulation, and how they carry out relationships with others. Attachment is found in all mammals to some degree, especially nonhuman primates.|$|E
2500|$|Internal {{control of}} {{techniques}} used in molecular biology, such as western blot and quantitative PCR. As actin {{is essential for}} cell survival it has been postulated that the quantity of actin is under such tight control at a cellular level {{that it can be}} assumed that its transcription (that <b>is,</b> <b>the</b> <b>degree</b> <b>to</b> <b>which</b> its genes are expressed) and translation, that is the production of protein, is practically constant and independent of experimental conditions. [...] Therefore, it is common practice in protein quantification studies (western blot) and transcription studies (quantitative PCR) to carry out the quantification of the gene of interest and also the quantification of a reference gene such as the one that codes for actin. By dividing the quantity of the gene of interest by that of the actin gene it is possible to obtain a relative quantity that can be compared between different experiments, whenever the expression of the latter is constant. It is worth pointing out that actin does not always have the desired stability in its gene expression.|$|E

He thought that there was a real difference between the reasonable suspicion and real likelihood tests. In his opinion, [...] "suspicion" [...] suggests a belief that something that may not be provable could still be possible. [...] "Reasonable" [...] suggests that the belief cannot be fanciful. Here the issue is whether it is reasonable for the one to harbour the suspicions in the circumstances even though the suspicious behaviour could be innocent. On the other hand, [...] "likelihood" [...] points towards something being likely, and [...] "real" [...] suggests that this must be substantial rather than imagined.

[...] Once a steamboat was in a fog bank, a captain would have to reckon very carefully from his experience on the run just where his boat was. [...] With no radar, captains proved remarkably adept at determining their position with echoes from the steamboat's whistle. [...] Sound travels at about 1,080 feet per second in a fog bank, and rounding off to 1,000 feet for safety, that meant that if an echo was heard one second after the whistle blast, the steamboat was 500 feet from shore.

Menon J.C. also disagreed with both Lord Goff in Gough and Phang J.C. in Tang Kin Hwa in that he thought the shift of the inquiry from how the matter might appear to a reasonable man to whether the judge thinks there is a sufficient possibility of bias was [...] "a very significant point of departure". The real likelihood test is met as long as the court is satisfied that there is a sufficient degree of possibility of bias. Although this a lower standard than satisfaction on a balance of probabilities, this is actually directed at mitigating the sheer difficulty of proving actual bias, especially given its insidious and often subconscious nature. The reasonable suspicion test, however, is met if the court is satisfied that a reasonable member of the public could harbour a reasonable suspicion of bias even though the court itself thought there was no real danger of this on the facts. The difference is that the driver behind this test is the strong public interest in ensuring public confidence in the administration of justice. As of September 2011, the Court of Appeal of Singapore had not yet expressed a view as to whether the position taken in Tang Kin Hwa or Shankar Alan is preferable.|$|E
