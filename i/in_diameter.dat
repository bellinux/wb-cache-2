5|$|Only the {{two largest}} regular moons have been imaged with a {{resolution}} sufficient to discern their shapes and surface features. Larissa, about 200km <b>in</b> <b>diameter,</b> is elongated. Proteus is not significantly elongated, but not fully spherical either: it resembles an irregular polyhedron, with several flat or slightly concave facets 150 to 250km <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> At about 400km <b>in</b> <b>diameter,</b> it {{is larger than the}} Saturnian moon Mimas, which is fully ellipsoidal. This difference may be due to a past collisional disruption of Proteus. The surface of Proteus is heavily cratered and shows a number of linear features. Its largest crater, Pharos, is more than 150km <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b>|$|E
5|$|The main {{structure}} of the fruit body consists primarily of an agglutination (mass) of interwoven skeletal hyphae, which are golden- to rust-brown. The hyphae are unbranched, forming long tubes 2 to 3.6μm <b>in</b> <b>diameter,</b> enveloping a lumen of variable thickness. There are also hyaline generative hyphae. These hyphae have thinner walls than the skeletal hyphae, and are also septate (possessing of septa), but are sometimes branched. They measure 2 to 3μm <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> The flesh, again, is primarily made up of skeletal hyphae with some generative hyphae. The thick-walled skeletal hyphae are a yellow-brown to rust brown, and are slightly less agglutinate. The hyphae in the flesh are a little smaller; the skeletal hyphae measure 1.8 to 3.4μm <b>in</b> <b>diameter,</b> while the generative hyphae measure 1.5 to 2.6μm <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b>|$|E
5|$|A {{few months}} later, Olbers was again {{attempting}} to locate Ceres {{when he noticed}} another moving object in the vicinity. This was the asteroid Pallas, coincidentally passing near Ceres at the time. The discovery of this object created interest in the astronomy community. Before this point it had been speculated by astronomers {{that there should be}} a planet in the gap between Mars and Jupiter. Now, unexpectedly, a second such body had been found. When Pallas was discovered, some estimates of its size were as high as 3,380km <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> Even as recently as 1979, Pallas was estimated to be 673km <b>in</b> <b>diameter,</b> 26% greater than the currently accepted value.|$|E

5|$|It {{has been}} {{suggested}} that Pallas has a moon. A moon about 1 kilometer <b>in</b> <b>diameter</b> was suggested based on occultation data from an occultation on 29 May 1978, and another one separated from Pallas by 750 kilometers and 175 kilometers <b>in</b> <b>diameter</b> itself was suggested in 1980, but later shown incorrect in 1983 occultation observations. Considering the level at which Pallas has been studied and observed since it was discovered, it is unlikely that there are any large moons orbiting Pallas.|$|E

These can even appear inside the mouth (buccal), or on the surface of the eye (scleral).

40|$|The {{method of}} choice for the {{treatment}} of choledochal cysts in children is excision of the cyst and Roux-en-Y (RY) choledochoenterostomy. When the ratio of the diameter of the main hepatic ductus to that of the proximal RY jejunum is 1 : 2. 5 or lower during choledochoenterostomy, end-to-end anastomosis is recommended. However, this method may cause a difference <b>in</b> <b>diameters</b> between the ends. Here we will present the technical difficulty we experienced due to the difference <b>in</b> <b>diameters</b> <b>in</b> end-to-end RY choledochoenterostomy and our modified anastomosis technique of anas¬tomosis. This slight modification eliminated problems with anastomosis caused by a difference <b>in</b> the <b>diameter</b> of the jejunum and shortened operation time...|$|R
5|$|Many of {{the other}} moons are small: 34 are less than 10km <b>in</b> <b>diameter</b> and another 14 between 10 and 50km <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> Traditionally, most of Saturn's moons have been named after Titans of Greek mythology.

The eleventh balloon of 12,000 cubic feet capacity was twenty-eight-feet <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> It was capable of carrying two men and all their associated observation equipment.

5|$|The fruit {{bodies of}} L.incarnatum are tiny, oval to roughly spherical, and measure 35–1250 by 200–450μm. The {{floating}} balls are sometimes enclosed {{in a loose}} subiculum, with a whitish surface that is byssoid (consisting of fine threads). The peridium (the outer protective tissue layer) is 18–30μm thick, byssoid, and made of clamped hyphae typically 2.5–4μm <b>in</b> <b>diameter</b> intertwined with dendrophyses (irregularly branched cystidia) 1μm <b>in</b> <b>diameter.</b> The surface of the peridium is hydrophobic, a feature that helps keep water off the growing hymenium during its development, and gives the fruit body buoyancy.|$|E

5|$|The small moon Dia, 4 {{kilometres}} <b>in</b> <b>diameter,</b> {{had gone}} missing since its discovery in 2000. One {{theory was that}} it had crashed into the much larger moon Himalia, 170 kilometres <b>in</b> <b>diameter,</b> creating a faint ring. This possible ring appears as a faint streak near Himalia in images from NASA's New Horizons mission to Pluto. This suggests that Jupiter sometimes gains and loses small moons through collisions. However, the recovery of Dia in 2010 and 2011 disproves the link between Dia and the Himalia ring, although {{it is still possible}} that a different moon may have been involved.|$|E
