50|$|When Tom Jr. {{started this}} process in 1949, IBM was {{reportedly}} two years behind its main competitor, UNIVAC. In the 1980s, it was arguably up to a decade ahead of anyone else; though its problems since {{seem to have}} destroyed much of its strength in this area. This was not so obvious to the outside world, because the new products still followed the conservative release pattern started in the 1920s (and pursued very profitably until recently). Despite the hype about 'pre-releasing' products which did not yet exist, only when the market was sufficiently developed, and a launch was financially justifiable, did IBM commit its marketing resources. In the labs though, {{they were able to}} plan speculatively for the future decades in advance, independent and untroubled by commercial demands. It was an ideal environment for an <b>industrial</b> <b>researcher,</b> and highly productive for IBM.|$|E
40|$|This paper {{proposes a}} model of the choice to commercialize {{research}}, of the amount and type of pre-commercial research to perform, and of the timing of commercialization by an academic scientist, and analyzes the returns and costs of these choices. The behavior and performance of the academic scientist is compared with that of an <b>industrial</b> <b>researcher.</b> Unlike the <b>industrial</b> <b>researcher,</b> the academic scientist receives direct benefit from performing research, e. g. in the form of publication and peer recognition. However, the type of research that is more effective in reducing commercialization costs may not be the one generating the highest scientific benefit. It is shown that, while in some cases the academic scientist is more reluctant to commercialize research, in other cases she may commercialize faster than a solely profit-seeking agent would-and perform less research. Academic and non-academic scientists also select different projects, and this may explain the good performance of academic entrepreneurs found in several empirical studies. The model offers a unified framework to interpret the mixed evidence on the success of, and the arguments in favor and against, the involvement of universities into commercial activities. Managerial and public policy implications are also examined. Copyright © 2009 John Wiley & Sons, Ltd. ...|$|E

40|$|Between 1900 and 1930, social {{scientists}} attempted to refashion social ethics by conducting extensive social research. Some of them collaborated with Herbert Hoover {{before and after}} he became president. In the 1920 s, they accepted positions on Herbert Hoover's various commissions. The work they did on these commissions made them a forum for manifesting their interest in modernizing social ethics. At {{one and the same}} time, they were in a position to define both social ethics and the purpose of the social sciences. Throughout this dissertation, I explore the cases of three {{social scientists}} involved with Hoover's commissions: the economist Wesley Clair Mitchell, the political scientist Charles Edward Merriam, and the <b>industrial</b> <b>researcher</b> and social worker Mary van Kleeck. Wesley Clair Mitchell addressed issues of American consumption and economic behaviour. Charles Edward Merriam analyzed the political behaviour of American citizens. Mary van Kleeck surveyed labour relations between American workers and employers. In this dissertation, I have employed methods developed by intellectual historians, focussing on the published and unpublished papers that these social experts and Herbert Hoover himself produced. This collaboration between Hoover and some of the most prominent social scientists of the day explains the ambitious project they undertook, that of adjusting social ethics to the modern living conditions they had discovered while carrying out their social research. In so doing, they sought to adapt the traditional code of conduct of most Americans to the new circumstances that prevailed in {{the first decades of the}} twentieth century...|$|E
40|$|The {{field of}} optical fibre sensors {{has been an}} {{attractive}} area of research, ever since the mid 1980 s, {{at a time when}} optical fibre communications technology had already started to find commercial success. The area was of great academic interest because of the wide variety of direct and indirect interactions with these new optical waveguides, both physical and chemical, which were seen to be possible. Much of the early research, mostly by academics who had previously worked in fibre communications, was highly speculative, and initially found very little commercial application. Even then, however, many confidently believed it to have great future potential. The difficulty at that time was that most existing electrical sensors were relatively cheap, and of course this technology was far more mature, whereas the fibre sensor area lacked many of the simple building blocks necessary for simple, reliable and cost-effective production. Many of the early sensors therefore, quite naturally struggled to find a competitive position. Since then, the many years of research has resulted in an increasing variety of available low-cost optical fibre components becoming available and the research on the sensor technology has lead to many truly useful sensors for what are still niche areas, but ones having real commercial potential. As a result, prospects for wider application are becoming better each year. The paper will start in a tutorial manner, by discussing and classifying the types of optical fibre sensors, discuss the care that has to be taken in their design, and will include a few case studies of some of the very early sensors. It will then go on to describe where several types of sensors have found successful application in the last decade. Finally, the author will discuss the areas where he believes they are likely to find increasing commercial success in future. Please note that the paper will present a personal view of the area, by a research scientist/engineer who has worked in the optical fibre sensors field since 1986, initially as an <b>industrial</b> <b>researcher</b> and later returning as an academic, and who is now active as a freelance consultant in the area...|$|E

40|$|In a {{previous}} paper, we {{have argued that}} technological communities provide a useful level of analysis to examine information and knowledge flows among researchers. Based on an international {{survey of more than}} 700 scientists and engineers engaged in the development of neural network technology, the information and knowledge exchange patterns of two important subsets of that particular technological community, i. e. academic <b>researchers</b> and <b>industrial</b> <b>researchers,</b> were explored. The analyses demonstrated that <b>industrial</b> <b>researchers,</b> even if they are more commercially oriented than their colleagues in academia, recognise the professional community as a relevant locus of information and knowledge. An obvious methodological need exists, though, to generalize beyond the neural networks community. This is the aim of the present paper.
