2500|$|Neither {{does the}} theme itself sound threatening, {{at least at}} first. For its latter half, Shostakovich quotes Graf Danilo's {{entrance}} song, [...] "Da geh' ich zu Maxim," [...] from Franz Lehár's operetta The Merry Widow. The Merry Widow was also Hitler's favorite operetta, which played well with Soviet propagandists writing about the symphony. A version of this song may have already existed in Russia. Set to the words, [...] "I'll go and see Maxim," [...] it was reportedly sung jokingly in the Shostakovich household to the composer's son. Arthur Lourié called the theme a [...] "trite, intentionally silly motif," [...] adding, [...] "This tune can be whistled by any Soviet man on the street...." [...] (Coincidentally, Conductor Evgeny Mravinsky echoed Lourié when he called it a <b>generalized</b> <b>image</b> of spreading stupidity and triteness.

60|$|It is necessary, however, to {{distinguish}} between the vague and the general. So long as we are content with Semon's composite image, we MAY get no farther than the vague. The question whether this image takes us to the general or not depends, I think, upon the question whether, in addition to the <b>generalized</b> <b>image,</b> we have also particular images of some of the instances out of which it is compounded. Suppose, for example, that {{on a number of occasions}} you had seen one negro, and that you did not know whether this one was the same or different on the different occasions. Suppose that in the end you had an abstract memory-image of the different appearances presented by the negro on different occasions, but no memory-image of any one of the single appearances. In that case your image would be vague. If, on the other hand, you have, in addition to the <b>generalized</b> <b>image,</b> particular images of the several appearances, sufficiently clear to be recognized as different, and as instances of the generalized picture, you will then not feel the generalized picture to be adequate to any one particular appearance, and you will be able to make it function as a general idea rather than a vague idea. If this view is correct, no new general content needs to be added to the <b>generalized</b> <b>image.</b> What needs to be added is particular images compared and contrasted with the <b>generalized</b> <b>image.</b> So far as I can judge by introspection, this does occur in practice. Take for example Semon's instance of a friend's face. Unless we make some special effort of recollection, the face is likely to come before us with an average expression, very blurred and vague, but we can at will recall how our friend looked on some special occasion when he was pleased or angry or unhappy, and this enables us to realize the generalized character of the vague image.|$|E

30|$|Finally, {{the biggest}} impact on {{efficiency}} in our investigation was in relation to changes to sensor pairing (i.e., varying patterns between conditions).

40|$|Hardware {{development}} for modern {{magnetic resonance imaging}} is reaching technological and physiological limits. Further acceleration of measurement experiments, as well as special methods for the acquisition of additional information, therefore {{require the use of}} advanced measurement protocols; these already have an inherently increased computational complexity of image reconstruction, and are especially sensitive to artifacts. Correction of multiple artifact sources using a single image reoncstruction method is impossible so far, especially in combination with so-called sensitivity encoding, which allows additional decreases in imaging time. In this work a <b>generalized</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction is proposed, which for the first time allows a simultaneous correction of multiple artifact sources in magnetic resonance imaging, including the combination with sensitivity encoding. Algorithms are developed which permit the computation of the <b>generalized</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction in acceptable time with modest requirements to the computation hardware. To this end, the iterative method of conjugate gradients for the solution of very large linear systems of equations is used. Further acceleration is achieved by discretization of acquired artifact parameters, {{and the use of the}} fast Fourier transform, as well as the parallelization of the method on various levels of implementation. The latter ist greatly facilitated by the highly regular structure of the base operations of the the <b>generalized</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction. Imaging experiments which sample the spatial frequency spectrum on an irregular, rather than on a conventional cartesian grid, can also be accelerated by introducing a two-dimensional variant of the fast Fourier transform for non-cartesian data sets. The <b>generalized</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction method was extended by a regularization of the underlying linear system of equations for the treatment of underdetermined or ill-posed image reconstruction problems. Simulations and real magnetic resonance experiments show, that the <b>generalized</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction works very satisfactory over a wide range of artifact levels, and is stable in the presence of noise. Even the most general variant can be calculated on standard computation hardware with moderate memory storage of a few megabytes in under one hour. Special cases of the <b>generalized</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction can already be calculated in very short time. One example with real data from a real-time magnetic resonance system shows the practical applicability of the method with currently unsurpassed reconstruction times of under one second. The apparent image quality of the reconstruction is generally very good. The normalized relative error of the reconstruction compared with an undistorted reference image can be reduced by at least a factor of 2. Even strong ghosting artifacts can be almost completely eliminated. Remaining artifacts caused by the reconstruction itself can be suppressed effectively by regularization. In summary, the <b>generalized</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction presents itself as a versatile method capable of replacing a whole palette of special image reconstruction and correction methods, and which opens up new possibilities for magnetic resonance imaging by combining the correction of multiple artifact sources. Performing the method is already possible today using standard computation hardware. The <b>generalized</b> <b>image</b> reconstruction is additionally suitable for implementation on dedicated computation hardware because of its inherent ability to be parallelized. It is therefore to be expected that it will become practical to use it in the near future...|$|E

40|$|We propose {{an image}} {{restoration}} method.

In addition, the method is a useful tool for improving results obtained by other image restoration methods. Toward that direction, we investigate the case where the arbitrary matrix is replaced by the matrix obtained by the Haar basis reconstructed image. The method has been tested by reconstructing an image after the removal of blur caused by the uniform linear motion and filtering the noise that is corrupted with the image pixels. The quality of the restoration is observable by a human eye. Benefits of using the method are illustrated by the values of the improvement in signal-to-noise ratio and in the values of peak signal-to-noise ratio...|$|R
