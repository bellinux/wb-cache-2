5|$|The <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> {{was absorbed}} by British Railways in 1948, {{and was given}} the Power {{classification}} 4P3F, denoting a mixed traffic locomotive.|$|E
5|$|The first Southern Railway livery {{continued}} {{that of the}} LSWR, {{but with}} the number displayed on the tender. However, from 1925, a darker Olive-type green was substituted, and the <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was so painted.|$|E
5|$|The {{decision}} to adopt blue {{as the standard}} colour was subsequently reversed and Brunswick green was introduced in November 1951 with No. 46232 Duchess of Montrose. Between October 1955 and December 1957, all 38 locomotives carried it concurrently, the only livery the <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> carried.|$|E

5|$|Because of {{insufficient}} clearance {{between the}} locomotives and the 25kV overhead electric wires south of Crewe, {{the whole class}} was banned from operating under them with effect from 1 September 1964. To highlight this prohibition a yellow diagonal stripe was painted on the cab sides. This inability of the locomotives to operate {{on the line for}} which they were designed was crucial in the decision to withdraw the <b>entire</b> <b>class.</b>|$|E
5|$|The Coronation {{class was}} {{probably}} painted in more styles of livery {{than any other}} engine class, seven in the LMS era up to 1947 and five more during the British Railways era from 1948 onwards. That {{does not mean that}} all 38 locomotives were painted in all these different styles; many were specific to just a few engines. The only style that all 38 bore was the British Railways lined Brunswick Green and the <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was turned out thus beween 1955 and 1958.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} {{gradually}} superseded on top link expresses during the 1940s by {{growing numbers of}} Bulleid Pacifics, although throughout the 1950s they were frequently called upon during peak periods or to deputise for failures. The rebuilding of the Pacifics in the late 1950s and their subsequent increased reliability rendered the Lord Nelson surplus to operational requirements, and they were gradually phased out of service. The <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was withdrawn during 1961 and 1962.|$|E

5|$|Before Gorbachev's {{visit to}} Washington, D.C., {{for the third}} summit in 1987, the Soviet leader {{announced}} his intention to pursue significant arms agreements. The timing of the announcement led Western diplomats to contend that Gorbachev was offering major concessions to the United States on the levels of conventional forces, nuclear weapons, and policy in Eastern Europe. He and Reagan signed the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty (INF Treaty) at the White House, which eliminated an <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> of nuclear weapons. The two leaders laid the framework for the Strategic Arms Reduction Treaty, or START I; Reagan insisted that {{the name of the}} treaty be changed from Strategic Arms Limitation Talks to Strategic Arms Reduction Talks.|$|E
5|$|Most of {{the chiefs}} {{respected}} Atangana as their spokesman and leader, and the Beti at large deferred to him prestige and power. A {{new system of}} status had evolved under his rule: a cadre of minor bureaucrats, envoys, interpreters, and office staff worked for Atangana and the other chiefs independent of the French government and were completely dependent on the chiefs. Atangana set up a private police force, for example, known as the fulus in Ewondo. The <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> recognised its reliance on the chiefs and gave them loyalty in exchange for protection and pay, and the chiefs relied on these functionaries to swiftly fulfill their duties to the French regime.|$|E
5|$|Partially {{because of}} the Crewkerne incident, and due to the incessant {{modification}} of Bulleid’s original design, British Railways took the decision to rebuild the <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> to a more conventional design by R. G. Jarvis, adopting many features from the BR 'Standard' locomotive classes that had been introduced since 1950. The air-smoothed casing was removed and replaced with conventional boiler cladding, and the chain-driven valve gear was replaced with three separate sets of Walschaerts valve gear. The rebuilds were provided with a completely revised cylindrical smokebox, a new Lord Nelson-type chimney and LMS-style smoke deflectors. Together {{with the lack of}} air-smoothed casing, these helped reduce the problem of smoke and steam obscuring the driver's vision of the line.|$|E

40|$|Ensuring {{correctness}} of real-world {{software applications}} is a challenging task. Testing {{can be used}} to find many bugs, but is typically not sufficient for proving correctness or even eliminating <b>entire</b> <b>classes</b> of bugs. However, formal proof and verification techniques tend to be very heavy weight and are simply not available for day to day use in many common programming environments. We demonstrate a form of light-weight proof assistant by using the type check-ing features of the programming language Haskell with existing extensions. We apply this work to the Open Source version control system Darcs. The properties checked by our approach are derived directly from the data model used by Darcs. This allows us to eliminate <b>entire</b> <b>classes</b> of bugs at compile time. We also examine how these techniques improve the quality of the Darcs codebase and the challenges that arise when applying these techniques in practice. ©Copyright by Jason Dagi...|$|R

5|$|The Nclass {{was also}} {{successful}} on the Central section, where they worked alongside L. B. Billinton's LB K class 2-6-0s. However the large cylinder and cab sizes of the Nclass prevented {{use of the}} type on the Eastern section's TonbridgeHastings line. The route's narrow bridges and tunnels were unable to accommodate the class, and provided justification for using the narrower 3-cylinder N1 class 2-6-0 on the route. Despite these restrictions, the class was capable of hauling heavy loads at moderate speeds, a useful attribute that was exploited throughout the Second World War. The <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> came into British Railways' ownership in 1948 and {{could be seen in}} most areas of the Southern Region.|$|E
5|$|The {{class was}} heavily used by British Railways: 29 {{locomotives}} required replacement cylinders between 1955 and 1961 due to excessive wear. Frames were occasionally replaced due to stress caused by heavy use, and the steam circuit was revised when new cylinders were fitted: the inside steam pipes of Maunsell's original design {{were replaced by}} outside steam pipes emerging from the smokebox, behind the smoke deflectors. From 1957, some of the locomotives had larger-diameter BR Standard Class4 chimneys fitted to improve draughting with poor-quality coal, though the decline of steam on the Southern Region precluded use on the <b>entire</b> <b>class.</b> Crew reports maintained that the latter modifications cut fuel and water consumption. The final set of modifications constituted the fitting of new injectors and Automatic Warning System (AWS) equipment in 1957 and 1959 respectively.|$|E
5|$|The {{other five}} {{submarines}} were scheduled for completion at 12-month intervals. However, {{the series of}} defects and problems encountered during sea trials of the submarines (particularly Collins) resulted in the repeated diversion of resources from those still under construction, adding to delays. Consequently, delivery of the submarines ran significantly behind schedule; submarines were presented to the RAN between 21and 41months late, and the <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was not cleared for full operational service until March 2004, {{a year after the}} last boat was commissioned. These delays forced the RAN to keep several Oberon-class submarines and the submarine base HMAS Platypus in service beyond their planned decommissioning dates.|$|E

5|$|British {{submarines}} {{were becoming}} increasingly {{active in the}} Baltic by late 1915; several cruisers had been sunk and the elderly Wittelsbach-class ships {{could no longer be}} risked there. Therefore, due to their age and vulnerability, they were withdrawn from active service and disarmed by 1916. They were used as training ships, with the exception of Mecklenburg, which was used as a prison ship. In 1919, Wittelsbach and Schwaben were converted into depot ships for minesweepers. The <b>entire</b> <b>class,</b> with the exception of Zähringen, were struck from the navy list after the end of World War I. Mecklenburg was struck on 27 January 1920, Wettin followed on 11 March 1920, and Wittelsbach and Schwaben were struck on 8 March 1921. The four ships were broken up between 1921–22. Zähringen was converted into a radio-controlled target ship in 1926–27. Royal Air Force bombers sank the ship in Gotenhafen in 1944; the wreck was broken up in 1949–50.|$|E
5|$|However, {{problems}} with the combat system, excessive noise, and engine breakdowns were recurring and appeared across the <b>entire</b> <b>class.</b> These and other shortcomings were often made harder to solve by disagreements between Kockums, ASC, Rockwell, the RAN, and the Australian Government over the nature of problems, their causes, and {{who was responsible for}} solving them. Media reporting of the problems during the mid-1990s was often negative and exaggerated, creating poor public perception. This was aided by politicians, who used the shortcomings to politically attack the Labor Party and Kim Beazley, particularly after Labor was defeated by the Liberal-National Coalition in the 1996 federal election, and Beazley became Leader of the Opposition. During the mid-1990s, it was recommended on several occasions that the submarine project be abandoned, and the completed submarines and incomplete hulls be broken up for scrap.|$|E
5|$|The 1928 {{accident}} inquiry did not attach {{blame to}} the Southern Railway for track maintenance or locomotive performance issues, {{and noted that}} the prototype had run for eight years over the same stretch of line without complaint. However, it identified the Brighton batch and No.A890 as being more susceptible to rolling on sharp curves with weak rail joints, although the <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> operated without incident on the former LBSCR network. The management of the Southern Railway realised that to have any success in operating the Kclass tanks on {{other parts of the}} network, vast stretches of track would require upgrading. With the prospect of storing 20 locomotives whilst the necessary upgrading took place, the management recommended the class be fully withdrawn from service. To recoup the expense of constructing the engines, Maunsell was given permission to rebuild them to the new SR Uclass 2-6-0 tender engine design in 1928. This decision also reduced the adverse publicity generated by the accident. However, many of the components discarded during the rebuilding process would later be re-used on another 2-6-4 tank locomotive designed to haul heavy freight on short trips: the 3-cylinder Wclass of 1932.|$|E

This marks the end of the <b>entire</b> KTM <b>class</b> 82's short history.|$|R
5|$|The <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> {{is based}} at , also known as Fleet Base West, which is located on Garden Island, {{off the coast of}} Western Australia. The {{decision}} to locate all six submarines at Stirling was prompted by the lack of suitable long-term facilities on the east coast of Australia (although individual submarines can use Fleet Base East in Sydney Harbour as a forward staging facility), and the proximity to Australian offshore interests, including most of the nation's external territories, the oil and natural gas resources of the North West Shelf, and the Indian Ocean sea lines of communication, through which the majority of Australia's seaborne trade passes. The submarines' primary missions are patrolling the waters of Australia and nearby nations, and gathering intelligence through the interception of electronic communications by foreign nations and the deployment/retrieval of special forces operatives.|$|E
5|$|The {{heart of}} Western Europe had been {{stabilized}} after the Christianization of the Saxon, Viking, and Hungarian peoples {{by the end}} of the 10th century. However, the breakdown of the Carolingian Empire gave rise to an <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> of warriors who now had little to do but fight among themselves. The random violence of the knightly class was regularly condemned by the church, and in response it established the Peace and Truce of God to prohibit fighting on certain days of the year. At the same time, the reform-minded papacy came into conflict with the Holy Roman Emperors, resulting in the Investiture Controversy. Popes such as Gregory VII justified the subsequent warfare against the Emperor's partisans in theological terms. It became acceptable for the Pope to utilize knights in the name of Christendom, not only against political enemies of the Papacy, but also against Al-Andalus, or, theoretically, against the Seljuq dynasty in the east.|$|E
5|$|The Schichau {{class were}} torpedo boats {{built for the}} Austro-Hungarian Navy between 1885 and 1891. A total of 22 boats were built by three {{shipbuilding}} companies; nine by Seearsenal Pola, six by Stabilimento Tecnico Triestino, and the remaining seven boats were built by Schichau-Werke. The class {{was one of the}} first torpedo boat classes built for the Austro-Hungarian Navy, and they were initially powered by steam from a single locomotive boiler. The <b>entire</b> <b>class</b> was reconstructed between 1900 and 1910, when they received two Yarrow boilers and a second funnel. Ten of the class were converted to minesweepers between 1911 and 1913, and apart from one that was discarded in 1911, all boats saw active service as part of local defence forces for Adriatic naval bases during World War I, with one being lost in the early days of the war. The remaining nine torpedo boats were also converted to minesweepers in 1917, although five still carried torpedoes. After the war, sixteen were allocated to Italy and four were allocated to the navy of the newly created Kingdom of the Serbs, Croats and Slovenes (later Yugoslavia). Except for one of the Yugoslav boats which was retained as a training vessel, all of the boats had been discarded and broken up by 1925. After capture during the April 1941 invasion of Yugoslavia the remaining boat saw service with the Italians then the Germans during World War II. She was lost in German hands sometime after September 1943.|$|E
