50|$|Ape Escape 2, {{like its}} predecessor, is a {{platform}} {{game in which}} players control Hikaru as he catches monkeys spread across each level. Like the previous game, players control Hikaru using the left analogue stick and shoulder buttons while using the right analogue stick to control various Gotcha Gadgets that are unlocked as the player progresses through the game. Along with returning gadgets such as the Stun Club, Monkey Net, and Dash Hoop, Ape Escape 2 introduces three new gadgets; the Bananarang, which attracts monkeys with its scent, the Water Cannon, which puts out fires, and the <b>Electro</b> <b>Magnet,</b> {{which can be used}} on magnetic surfaces. New to the game is the monkey sidekick, Pipotchi, who accompanies Hikaru through most of the game. While with Hikaru, Pipotchi can give the player hints, help Hikaru reach ledges, and revive him when he gets knocked out.|$|E

Fiber reinforced polymer matrix composite materials with thin hard surface coatings have been developed and tested for manufacturing of hydraulic and pneumatic piston valves. The analysis has shown that the valves, actuated by a piezoelectric actuator consumes much less electric energy than the valve, actuated by the <b>electro</b> <b>magnets</b> and also achieves better dynamic characteristics...|$|R
40|$|Future {{missions}} for space-based {{experiments in}} gravitational physics require a drag-free Gravitational Reference Sensor. Such a setup requires a spherical test mass, where {{the position of}} the mass is determined by laser interferometry. The concept of using the surface of a levitating sphere as the measurement mirror for the interferometer has to be proven. Therefore, an inertial reference sensor is currently under development at Airbus Defence and Space GmbH. In this setup the sphere will be levitated through magnetic force. This thesis presents the development of the control system for the magnetic levitation setup, which consists of two current controlled <b>electro</b> <b>magnets</b> and two light barriers for the position estimation. Based on theoretical and practical investigations two controllers are designed from the identi�ed system model. Firstly a gain scheduled full state feed back controller and secondly a reduced order state controller is designed. As a result the experimentally evaluated controllers allow the sphere to oat in a range of 1 mm with an error less then 1 �m. This allows the further investigation of the inertial reference sensor...|$|R

40|$|The {{aerodynamic}} {{forces and}} moments acting upon a magnetically suspended {{wind tunnel model}} are derived from calibrations of suspension <b>electro</b> <b>magnet</b> currents against known forces. As {{an alternative to the}} conventional calibration method of applying steady forces to the model, early experiences with dynamic calibration are outlined, that is a calibration obtained by oscillating a model in suspension and deriving a force/current relationship from its inertia force and the unsteady components of currents. Advantages of dynamic calibration are speed and simplicity. The two methods of calibration applied to one force component show good agreement...|$|E
40|$|Öhlins CES Technologies in Jönköping have in {{the last}} 30 years been {{developing}} control valves for semi active suspension systems used in the car industry. The system, marketed by Öhlins under the brand name CES (Continuously controlled Electronic Suspension), enables a wide working range and ability {{to adapt to the}} current road conditions. By controlling  the valve in different ways there are also possibilities to decide on a specfic damper characteristic such as sport or comfort. The CES valve is working as a pilot controlled pressure regulator and is continuously controlled with help of an <b>electro</b> <b>magnet.</b> The CES valve is mounted in a uniflow damper which in turn guarantees the flow through the valve to go in only one direction independently ofdamper stroke direction. The rst part of the thesis investigates the damping characteristics in the latest model of the CES valve (i. e the CES 8700). A simulation model is made to approximate the damping in the solenoid plunger. Questions that are answered are: How is damping dened, what creates damping in the valve, how large is the damping, what parameters aect the damping. The second part of the thesis investigates new and already prototyped damping concepts with help of simulation. This has been done in order to optimize the valve damping and in turn the damper performance. The simulation results show that the valve dynamics can be improved but often at the expense of a slower valve...|$|E

This induction heating system is made of a swirled coil and a high frequency inverter, when this coil is conducted 30 kHz AC current, the plate finned tube type heat exchanger was heated by the <b>electro</b> and <b>magnet</b> phenomena. From the practical point of this defrost system, at first, the analysis of the pressure drop of coil and heat exchanger was conducted to evaluate, secondary, the measurement of impedance and the induction heating defrost test were conducted to investigate the heating efficiency and the defrost time. Thus, it is found that the heat exchanger was uniformly heated and the frost of 170 g on the surface of that were melted by the induction heating for 30 min. From these fact, the validity of the proposed system was verified...|$|R
40|$|At {{the end of}} the 19 th century a {{union was}} founded with members who owned a boat. For a living they brought the {{moorings}} of the seagoing vessels to the quay. As soon as the ship was moored the loading and unloading began. This was a slow process because they didn't have any big cranes and everything had to be done by hand. More then a hundred years later, in 2002, the mooring of the great seagoing vessels in the port of Rotterdam is still based on the same principle. With only this difference that nowadays time is money and so the process has to be accelerated if possible. This speeding up of the mooring process is the number one reason to start a research for the possibility to moor a ship without moorings. If there is an alternative way of mooring, what would it look like and what will be the advantages in comparison of the today's system. Some of the advantages are the reduction of the ships motion while berthed, a gain of time because of the faster mooring process and achieving a safer situation in the port by loosing the moorings. To find a new mooring system no option is excluded. However not all the systems found have the same feasibility, so they are not all worked out in a preliminary designs. By means of a Multi Criteria Analysis (MCA) only the 3 best systems out of the total of 5 are worked out. The first system is the hydrostatic mooring system. This one is based on a difference in water pressure over the width of the ship. The difference in pressure is caused by lowering the water level at the quayside of the ship. Due to a variation of the water level the exact force needed to hold the ship can be reached. The second system is de movable bottom. Here the ship is lifted out of the water over a certain height. Because of the friction between the ship and the lifting box the ship will stay at place. The most important issue here is the balance of the downward and upward forces. The third system works with (<b>electro)</b> <b>magnets</b> which hold the ship at the quay. The wind load to be taken by a system is calculated through the rules given in some publications of the Oil Companies International Marine Forum. The load by a passing ship in the harbour is taken from a simulationstudy for the Yangtzehaven at the Maasvlakte I in Rotterdam. The other boundary conditions needed for the design were also taken from the plans for this harbour. One of these conditions is the design vessel of the class Southampton++. This containervessel has a length over all of 382 metres, a width of 57 metres and a maximum draught of 17 metres. Through the summation of the wind- and passingloads the maximum load perpendicular to the quay is found to be 10. 170 kN. Parallel to the quay the load is 1947 kN. While designing the three systems it is assumed that both these forces, perpendicular and parallel to the quay, has to be taken by each of the systems. The only movement of the ship that is allowed is the vertical one. This is caused by the tide of 2, 09 metres en the vertical movement of the ship itself of 5 metres. With these given numbers a preliminary design is made of all three system in which the dimensions and an estimation of the costs are calculated. The same MCA as already mentioned is used to find the best system over all. The final opinion of this report is that the system with magnetism is the very best and even the far most cheapest system designed. With a price of just over 8 ̆ 0660. 000,- this system will hold the designship at his berth. The complete system consists of 52 magnets with an area of 1 by 1 metre and a thickness of 0, 25 metre. The magnets have a comb like shape through which the North and South pole appear alternating. By designing the magnet in the same dimensions as the ships hull the generated magnetic field will be kept inside the circuit these two elements make and will not put out any harm. Every pole needs 1200 windings to generate the right magnetic field. In total the winding need 35. 000 meters of copper wire with a diameter of 2 mm. The magnetic field of 1 Tesla is generated by using a current of 384 V and 2 A. The needed power for each magnet is 768 W. The use of the current will be no problem because the cranes on the quay use 10 kV. Hydraulic EngineeringCivil Engineering and Geoscience...|$|R
40|$|Current magneto-mechanical {{experiments}} {{measure the}} macroscopic magnetic-field-induced strain (MFIS) of magnetic shape-memory alloys (MSMA) {{by measuring the}} deformation of a sample in one direction. The macroscopic strain {{is the result of}} reorientation of the lattice of the MSMA due to an applied magnetic field or mechanical deformation. The lattice is reoriented by moving twin boundaries (TB). To study the motion of individual twin boundaries, an optical magneto-mechanical device (OMMD) was built. Optics, lighting, and a high resolution camera (21 Mega pixels) were put into a custom built apparatus that allows the entire setup to be rotated. While the sample is aligned with the optics and camera, the apparatus is put between the pole pieces of a strong <b>electro</b> <b>magnet</b> with a magnetic field strength up to 2 T. Using the image analysis software “Machine Vision” of National Instruments, the live footage can be analyzed in real time to calculate strain values in two dimensions. Furthermore, the individual TB movements can be recorded and paired with positional data of the sample relative to the magnetic field using a rotational encoder connected in line with the OMMD. By using a modular design, the OMMD can easily be put onto a heating/cooling stage where the phase transformation, especially the martensite-austenite interface, can be studied without an applied magnetic field. Future modifications include combining the heating/cooling stage with the rotating OMMD apparatus for in situ phase transformation experiments in a magnetic field as well as the addition of optical filters and a quarter wave plate to enhance optical contrast...|$|E
