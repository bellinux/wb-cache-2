5|$|In 1973 the LPO {{was caught}} up in a {{recurring}} phenomenon of London orchestral life: the conviction in official circles that having four independent orchestras <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> one city, and that two or more of the existing ensembles should merge. On this occasion the targets were the LPO and the New Philharmonia; the latter, a self-governing body formed under its new name when the Philharmonia was disbanded in 1964, was going through a bad patch, professionally and financially. The proposed merger would inevitably have led to redundancies, and the player-owners of both orchestras rejected the plan.|$|E

She refuses to wear a wire and informs the FBI that she {{may be able to}} persuade her fiancé Christopher to co-operate and become an informant against Tony. She confesses to Christopher that she has been informing and that the FBI would give them new identities if they would testify. Christopher is grief-stricken and nearly kills her. He leaves the apartment, saying he needs time to think. Tony has Silvio pick up Adriana under the pretense of taking her to see Christopher, but instead drives her out to the woods and executes her. Adriana’s betrayal and subsequent execution <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> Christopher to handle and he briefly returns to drug abuse to deal with the pain.|$|E

25|$|Since this theory, the 'closet scene' {{in which}} Hamlet confronts {{his mother in}} her private {{quarters}} has been portrayed in a sexual light in several performances. Hamlet is played as scolding his mother for having sex with Claudius while simultaneously wishing (unconsciously) that he could take Claudius' place; adultery and incest is what he simultaneously loves and hates about his mother. Ophelia's madness after her father's death may be read through the Freudian lens {{as a reaction to}} the death of her hoped-for lover, her father.

For a second time, Arthur is faced with a police investigation and with all the evidence stacked against him, he is soon arrested and ends the year behind bars.

He takes Weena with him on an expedition to a distant structure that turns out to be the remains of a museum, where he finds a fresh supply of matches and fashions a crude weapon against Morlocks, whom he must fight to get back his machine. He plans to take Weena back to his own time. Because the long and tiring journey back to Weena's home <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> them, they stop in the forest, and they are then overcome by Morlocks in the night, and Weena faints. The Traveller escapes when a small fire he had left behind them to distract the Morlocks catches up to them as a forest fire; Weena and the pursuing Morlocks are lost in the fire, and the Time Traveler is devastated over his loss.|$|E

25|$|As {{compared}} to other types of CP, and especially as {{compared to}} hypotonic or paralytic mobility disabilities, spastic CP is typically more easily manageable by the person affected, and medical treatment can be pursued on a multitude of orthopedic and neurological fronts throughout life. In any form of spastic CP, clonus of the affected limb(s) may sometimes result, as well as muscle spasms resulting from the pain or stress of the tightness experienced. The spasticity can and usually does lead to a very early onset of muscle stress symptoms like arthritis and tendinitis, especially in ambulatory individuals in their mid-20s and early-30s. Occupational therapy and physical therapy regimens of assisted stretching, strengthening, functional tasks, or targeted physical activity and exercise are usually the chief ways to keep spastic CP well-managed. If the spasticity <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the person to handle, other remedies may be considered, such as antispasmodic medications, botulinum toxin, baclofen, or even a neurosurgery known as a selective dorsal rhizotomy (which eliminates the spasticity by reducing the excitatory neural response in the nerves causing it).|$|E

[...] He takes a postmodern approach; Maus [...] "feeds on itself", telling the story of how the story was made. It examines the choices Spiegelman made in the retelling of his father's memories, and the artistic choices he had to make—for example, when his French wife converts to Judaism, Spiegelman's character frets over whether to depict her as a frog, a mouse, or another animal.|$|E

[...] Passing Chiswick Steps four seconds ahead, the Light Blues continued to increase their advantage, passing below Barnes Bridge four lengths ahead. [...] They passed the finishing post five lengths ahead in a time of 21 minutes 6 seconds. [...] It was the largest winning margin since the 1929 race and the slowest winning time since the 1925 race when Oxford sank in adverse conditions. [...] It was Cambridge's thirteenth consecutive victory, a record streak in the history of the Boat Race, and took the overall record in the event to 4740 in their favour. [...] E. P. Evans wrote that [...] "no praise <b>is</b> <b>too</b> <b>much</b> <b>for</b> the gallant Oxford crew" [...] while of Cambridge he noted [...] "though they may not have produced their best form in the early part of the race they made up for it later". [...] The rowing correspondent for The Times stated that [...] "it was an exciting race over the first half of the course" [...] and praised the Light Blues saying [...] "all credit is due to the Cambridge crew for the manner in which they recovered themselves after being led through such bad water". [...] William Beach Thomas, writing in The Observer, claimed [...] "Cambridge were described as the best crew in the chronicles of rowing kings, and Oxford the very worst".|$|E

[...] "Horace Walpole summed up for the unbelievers when he pronounced {{at the end of the}} eighteenth century, 'I cannot imagine that Dr Johnson's reputation will be very lasting.'
