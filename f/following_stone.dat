The U.S. Highways descend the mountain to Wallens Creek, then pass through several sweeping curves before diverging at the hamlet of Dot. US 421 heads northwest and passes through the hamlet of Woodway before crossing the Powell River.

US 421 and US 58 Alternate head through the center of town along Morgan Avenue before US 421 heads out of town along the North Fork of the Powell River and the rail line through Pennington Gap, which is a water gap through Stone Mountain.

40|$|Introduction: Ureteral {{intussusception}} is a rarely reported condition, {{primarily as}} a complication of ureteric tumours. Fewer than 30 case reports have been made. This case represents the first reported case, to our knowledge, of ureteral intussusception caused by a ureteric calculus. Presentation of case: We present {{the case of a}} 70 year old man with a history of conservatively managed renal calculi, in whom obstructive ureterolithiasis was incidentally detected. Retrograde pyelography and ureteroscopy revealed intussusception of the ureter around a calculus. Extensive biopsies revealed no evidence of tumour, and the intussusception resolved <b>following</b> <b>stone</b> clearance. Discussion: Literature review of previously reported cases of ureteral intussusception revealed 26 cases, of which 22 were secondary to tumour and 4 were secondary to surgical procedures. We propose a mechanism by which calculus-related ureteral intussusception may occur, and suggest treatment for this condition. Conclusion: Calculus-related ureteral intussusception is a rare condition, of which this represents the only case report. Management of the condition should involve excluding the presence of tumour, and then clearing the stone, avoiding the use of a basket for retrieval of fragments...|$|E
40|$|To {{investigate}} {{the occurrence of}} viruses in peach, leaf samples were collected from peach trees in commercial orchard of six areas in Korea. Reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) was used to identify {{the presence of the}} <b>following</b> <b>stone</b> fruit viruses: Apple chlorotic leaf spot virus (ACLSV), Apple mosaic virus (ApMV), Prune dwarf virus (PDV), Prunus necrotic ringspot virus (PNRSV) and Plum pox virus (PPV). About 65. 0 % of the 515 samples were infected with ACLSV and PNRSV. Virus-like symptoms showing mosaic on leaves was observed in ACLSV infected peach trees. However, PNRSV infected peach trees showed no symptoms. These viral DNAs by sequence analysis were confirmed 4 ACLSV isolates and 3 PNRSV isolates. The Korean peach isolates of ACLSV and PNRSV showed 70 − 99 % and 88 − 99 % amino acid sequence identities, respectively, with those reported previously and their amino acid sequence identities with each other were approximately 95 % and 88 %, respectively. Phylogenetic analysis indicated that the Korean ACLSV isolates belong to the A group of ACLSV. The Korean PNRSV isolates reported in this study wer...|$|E
40|$|A subgrid scale (SGS) {{model for}} {{partially}} premixed combustion has been implemented {{and applied to}} simulate the backdraft phenomena and its mitigation by watermist. The model {{is based on the}} coupling of independent approaches for non-premixed and premixed turbulent combustion. The "flame index" concept was used to separate the two different combustion regimes. This index describes the structure of the flame based on fuel and oxygen gradients. By using this approach, it is possible to implement individually the most suitable combustion models for each structure. In the current study, the Large Eddy Laminar Flamelet Model (LELFM) was used for non-premixed combustion and the flame surface density approach for premixed combustion. Simulations were conducted for the reduced scale backdraft tests of Weng and Fan [1]. The predicted pressure-time curve is in good agreement with the measurement. The predicted mass flow rate versus time has also captured the correct trend indicated by the measurement but quantitatively relatively larger discrepancies are found. For the simulation with watermist, a correlation for the laminar burning velocity of the methane-air-diluent-water vapor system was introduced <b>following</b> <b>Stone</b> and Clarke [2] and Liaio et al. [3]. In line with the experimental observation, the watermist was found to have mitigated the backdraft by reducing the prevailing laminar flame velocity, resulting in lower temperature and pressure distributions within the compartment. However, in this particular case, the mist did not completely suppress the turbulent deflagration. Further study to optimize the mist injection time, speed, quantity, and direction is needed to achieve this goal...|$|E

5000|$|Pauling began {{studying}} vitamin C mega-dosage, and orthomolecular medicine more broadly, {{after he was}} contacted in 1966 by biochemist Irwin Stone, who suggested that taking enough vitamin C would let him live another fifty years. Pauling reinterpreted the large body of research on vitamin C based on comparative studies of the biochemical genetics of vitamin C synthesis in different species, as well his own theories about [...] "molecular disease" [...] and recent developments in molecular evolution. He criticized the design of studies that did not find positive results for vitamin C mega-dose treatment, and promoted those that did. He and other vitamin C advocates thought the vitamin boosts the body's ability to fight all kinds of infection. By 1970, after <b>following</b> <b>Stone's</b> regimen for 4 years and studying and debating the issue extensively, Pauling was sure enough that organized medicine had it wrong that he wrote Vitamin C and the Common Cold to popularize his vitamin C message.|$|R

50|$|Titanica is a 1992 IMAX {{documentary}} {{film about the}} RMS Titanic. The film was directed by Stephen Low and narrated by Cedric Smith, Anatoly Sagalevich and Ralph White. The film mostly focuses on footage taken at {{the wreck of the}} RMS Titanic, also featuring footage of the expedition crew searching the wreck as well as interviews with Titanic survivors Frank John William Goldsmith and Eva Hart.

It was the second feature length IMAX film released, <b>following</b> <b>Stones</b> at the Max in 1991. An edited 40 minute version of the film was also later released for IMAX theatres in 1995; this version had new narration by Leonard Nimoy, though it retains most of White's narration.
