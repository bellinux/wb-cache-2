25|$|The doctor {{warned me}} – {{and so did}} members of my family soon {{afterward}} – that if I did not keep my epilepsy a secret, people would fear me and I {{would be subject to}} discrimination. Even now, seven years after that scene in the dining hall, it is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to say that I have epilepsy. Back then, it was impossible. In the years since, I have had hundreds of various types of seizures. I have experienced the mental, physical and emotional side effects caused by changes in the anticonvulsant drugs I take each day. Yet, for the first two years, I refused to learn about epilepsy. My fears of being found out were my real concern.|$|E
500|$|During filming, Roth held {{a grudge}} against Heston {{due to his}} work with the National Rifle Association: [...] "It was very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> On one level, there's the man and he's my dad. But on the other level, the whole NRA thing {{is what it is}} now. I'm so against it, very vocally so. But it was {{inappropriate}} for the workplace. If I'm going to talk to him, I'll talk to him outside the workplace. So it was just two guys in makeup doing a scene." [...] Roth later claimed he would not have appeared in the film had he known he would be sharing a scene with Heston.|$|E

500|$|In April 2016, {{during the}} week leading up to Record Store Day, for which the band was its {{ambassador}} for 2016, Ulrich told Billboard that the band's expanded role within the music industry had {{played a part in}} {{the amount of time that}} it had taken to write and record the album. [...] "The way we do things now is very different than the way we did things back in the days of Kill 'Em All and Ride the Lightning. Nowadays we like to do so many different things." [...] Ulrich was also optimistic that production of the album had almost reached its completion. [...] "Unless something radical happens it would be <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to believe that it won't come out in 2016".|$|E
500|$|... "Consider the lyrics: Prayed {{through the}} nights / Felt so alone / Suffered from {{alienation}} / Carried the weight {{on my own}} / Had to be strong / So I believed / And now I know I've succeeded / In finding the place I conceived. Well, just because you are young doesn't mean that you haven't had a hard life. It's been <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> moving around so much, having to grow up by myself, basically on my own, my parents divorced. And I always felt kind of different from everyone else in my neighborhoods. I was a different person – ethnically. And sometimes {{that can be a}} problem. If you look a certain way everybody goes, 'White girl,' and I'd go, 'No, that's not what I am.'" ...|$|E
500|$|The {{music of}} Nine Inch Nails has {{reportedly}} {{been used by}} the U.S. military as music torture to break down the resolve of detainees. Reznor objected to the use of his music in this way with the following message {{on the front page of}} the Nine Inch Nails website: [...] "It's <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to imagine anything more profoundly insulting, demeaning and enraging than discovering music you've put your heart and soul into creating has been used for purposes of torture. If there are any legal options that can be realistically taken they will be aggressively pursued, with any potential monetary gains donated to human rights charities. Thank GOD this country has appeared to side with reason and we can put the Bush administration's reign of power, greed, lawlessness and madness behind us." ...|$|E
6000|$|... “Well,” {{said the}} man, {{in a voice}} that was curiously expressionless, “you heard Miss Harding’s story. She was very fair—about Lucy Davidson—but you can realize how <b>difficult</b> it is <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to go into that?” ...|$|R
5000|$|... "The post-Ant Farm {{period was}} a <b>difficult</b> {{transition}} <b>for</b> <b>me</b> {{because of the}} loss of the support structure that the group provided, both creatively and financially, but this eventually led me to teaching. I thought that maybe teaching would be a similar collaborative process, and in some ways it is. Since I'm still doing it 25 years later, I have to say that university affiliation has worked for me." ...|$|R
5000|$|In May 2010 Robinson called {{time on his}} rugby career after a {{degenerative}} {{knee injury}} forced him to retire after two seasons at the Wasps. He said [...] "It {{has been a very}} <b>difficult</b> season <b>for</b> <b>me</b> and despite every effort to come back, my knee injury is just too severe and too painful to continue". He only played 24 times for the Wasps in his period with the club.|$|R
500|$|Hepburn {{received}} an Academy Award nomination {{for the second}} year running for her work opposite Burt Lancaster in The Rainmaker (1956). Again she played a lonely woman empowered by a love affair, and it became apparent that Hepburn had found a niche in playing [...] "love-starved spinsters" [...] that critics and audiences enjoyed. Hepburn said of playing such roles, [...] "With Lizzie Curry [...] and Jane Hudson [...] and Rosie Sayer —I was playing me. It wasn't <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to play those women, because I'm the maiden aunt." [...] Less success that year came from The Iron Petticoat (1956), a reworking of the classic comedy Ninotchka, with Bob Hope. Hepburn played a cold-hearted Soviet pilot, a performance Bosley Crowther called [...] "horrible". It was a critical and commercial failure, and Hepburn considered it the worst film on her resume.|$|E
500|$|After Winehouse's death, {{according}} to Pete Doherty, he and Winehouse were lovers at one point, {{speaking to the}} Daily Mail about it he said [...] "This is <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to admit. But, yes, it's true. Amy and I were lovers. I loved her then and, well, I still do today. But towards the end, as only lovers can, she became quite mean and cruel to me. She didn't suffer fools… and believe me, she had a mean right hook." [...] However, in July 2008, Rolling Stone reporter Claire Hoffman asked Winehouse about her relationship with Doherty. Winehouse replied: [...] "We're just good friends", and added: [...] "I asked Pete to do a concept EP, and he made this face, {{he looked at me}} like I'd pooed on the floor. He wouldn't do it. We're just really close".|$|E
500|$|After trying various {{science fiction}} shows after Lost, the Los Angeles Times Andrew Hanson felt the episode made [...] "him feel like [...] picked a winner". Like other critics, Hanson loved the twist ending, writing that [...] "Fringe {{is making it}} more and more <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to pick my {{favorite}} episode". Television Without Pity called Walternate's sudden appearance one of 2010's [...] "Most Memorable TV Moments", explaining [...] "We knew we'd meet him eventually, but the way they surprised us {{with him at the}} end of a stand-alone episode was a fitting introduction for such an ominous and shadowy character, and we knew even then that it marked a new and improved era for the show." [...] At the time, TV Fanatic called [...] "Northwest Passage" [...] the best Fringe episode to date, giving the series' its first [...] "five out of five stars".|$|E
5000|$|On May 1, 2017 it was {{announced}} that drummer Allan Tschicaja had left the band. In a statement he said: [...] "It’s been a <b>difficult</b> decision <b>for</b> <b>me,</b> but I want to focus more on family, friends and other projects."

As the new band were in rehearsals in January 1978, Osbourne had {{a change}} of heart and rejoined Black Sabbath. [...] "Three days before we were due to go into the studio, Ozzy wanted to come back to the band", Iommi explained. [...] "He wouldn't sing any of the stuff we'd written with the other guy (Walker), so it made it very difficult. We went into the studio with basically no songs. We'd write in the morning so we could rehearse and record at night. It was so difficult, like a conveyor belt, because you couldn't get time to reflect on stuff. 'Is this right? Is this working properly?' It was very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to come up with the ideas and putting them together that quick." ...|$|E
500|$|Reger {{completed}} {{the composition of}} the psalm in May to August 1909. The work was published by Peters in Leipzig, first the vocal score with piano in September 1909, with the piano reduction prepared by Reger himself.

In Chemnitz, Reger conducted the church choir of St. Lukas and the municipal orchestra (Städtische Kapelle), with Georg Stolz at the organ. In Breslau, [...] conducted the Sing-Akademie and the Orchester-Verein, with organist Max Ansorge. A reviewer wrote in the journal NMZ: [...] "" [...] (Still under the impression of what we heard and experienced, it is unspeakably <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to express here all the deeply experienced, the sublime and divine of that hour. One was deeply shaken, when the gigantic double fugue ended, had experienced something unforgettable.") ...|$|E
500|$|Millar did {{not like}} the first draft of the screenplay, {{considering}} that the approach was [...] "too tame" [...] and [...] "a little bit Americanized" [...] given he wanted [...] "basically be the opposite of the Spider-Man movie, the idea of someone getting powers and realizing they can do what they want, then choosing the dark path." [...] The author only started to support the direction the project was taking once Bekmambetov [...] "came in with his Eastern European madness" [...] and the intention of coming closer to the spirit of the book. Bekmambetov said that he would take liberty in adapting the comic book's world: [...] "It’s <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to just follow. It’s interesting for me to create. I feel a little bit different how this world has to be executed". In July 2006, screenwriter Chris Morgan was hired to revise the third act of the Wanted script written by Haas and Brandt.|$|E

In a statement issued on her departure, she said: [...] "I chose to play a positive role model and wanted to encourage these young people in their endeavours, rather than criticise them. Although leaving Popstars Live was a <b>difficult</b> decision <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to make, I do feel somewhat relieved that I can now focus on my music."

In her announcement she said, [...] "My dad needs daily care and he needs me. The idea of being away 16 hours a day for five months, I couldn't do it.

500|$|... "Hikari" [...] and [...] "Simple & Clean" [...] {{are often}} cited as [...] "one of the best video game songs in recent history", as {{described}} by Dannii C. from Celebmix.com. Alex Hanavan from The Young Folks listed the orchestral version of [...] "Hikari", which also appeared during the credits section of Kingdom Hearts, at number two on their [...] "Top Ten Video Game Theme Songs". He stated his reason through his extended review; [...] "Kingdom Hearts has several 'theme songs' but the orchestrated version of 'Hikari' takes the cake with all {{the makings of a}} grand adventure. It resonates with the many themes of the games: friendship, teamwork, and adventure. 'Hikari' undoubtedly brings back wealth of memories for any fan of the franchise." [...] GameFAQs's editor Pierce Sparrow listed both [...] "Simple & Clean" [...] and [...] "Sanctuary" [...] at number two on their [...] "Top Ten Lyrical Songs for a Video Game". Sparrow stated: [...] "It was a little too <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to choose just one of the songs, seeing as they have very similar qualities... I doubt that anyone will disagree that these are two of the greatest theme songs ever produced." ...|$|E
500|$|Chopra {{described}} her character Sweety as [...] "feisty and vivacious". She said, [...] "Sweety is very busy, {{and does not}} have time {{to take care of her}} looks and apply make up. Her only aim in life is to bunk her lectures and visit her boyfriend's college or stay in his hotel, and eventually marry him." [...] Chopra described both her character and herself as being [...] "outspoken and fun loving" [...] as well as honest and unable to [...] "hide something that is wrong". She said she had a different cultural background to Sweety, and found it challenging to convincingly portray a Maharashtrian Marathi girl. She had to adopt body language and a Maharashtrian accent to suit the character. She learnt the Marathi language to make the character as authentic as possible, which she found difficult as a Punjabi. Chopra said: [...] "I am speaking a lot of Marathi in the film. It was <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> because it's a difficult language and I am not good at Marathi. But I think it's my luck that through Kaminey I got to learn one more language." ...|$|E

Gaga wore the meat dress to accept her Video of the Year trophy for [...] "Bad Romance"; as she accepted the award from presenter Cher, she joked, [...] "I never thought I'd be asking Cher to hold my meat purse." [...] Gaga continued to wear the dress after the awards show for press photos and an interview on The Ellen DeGeneres Show. Gaga explained her interpretation of the dress to DeGeneres, stating, [...] "If we don’t {{stand up for what}} we believe in and if we don’t fight for our rights pretty soon we’re going to have as much rights as the meat on our bones." [...] "Now, I love Lady Gaga, but as someone who also loves animals, it was really <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to sit next to Lady Gaga while she was wearing that outfit," [...] DeGeneres, who is vegan, later wrote.

Duplock has stated that: [...] "One thing that was quite <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to get right was the idea that she didn't want sex. It's Whitney's way of keeping Tony happy. If she lets him do it, then he's nicer to her and he makes her feel special." [...] Research highlighted the fact that 12% of abused children go on to become abusers in turn, however Duplock explained: [...] "We felt that to imply on TV that someone who has been abused {{is going to go on}} to abuse other people is not a message you want to give out. Those people have been through enough." [...] Narducci for the NSPCC stated that importance was placed on making children viewing the show [...] "feel comfortable about asking for help if they felt they needed it [...] for the wider community - to recognise the signs and let them know that they can do something about it. [...] We're not trying to cause a national panic. This is a responsible effort to try to get over an important story." ...|$|E
500|$|It's {{something}} that's very <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me.</b> Because it is {{lines on}} paper when I {{do it in}} the comic book series. It's like, 'Oh, okay, Charlie Adlard [...] doesn’t have to draw that arrangement of lines anymore, that person is dead.' But it's very uncomfortable for me to be on set, because I see these actors that are there and, in the source material, I have killed all but two of them. I walk through the set and I'm like, 'Yep, killed that one, killed that one, killed that one.' And it is firing those people. I feel really bad for Emma Bell, just because she was great and I {{would have liked to have}} had her in the show. But, you know, this is The Walking Dead, characters have got to die. Thankfully, Emma was brought onto the show with the understanding that she was only going to be in a certain number of episodes and she knew that she was going to die from the very beginning. But it doesn’t really make it any easier. When they were shooting those scenes, I had to fly to Comic-Con and so I wasn’t actually there for when she died. But it was very emotional on set and I know that she was very upset about having to leave the crew and the actors. You kind of become a family when you're doing a TV show and it’s a little upsetting to have to get rid of somebody.|$|E
500|$|Brian Riordan, {{one of the}} {{engineers}} who worked on mastering the audio for the DVD described in a video interview with Rolling Stone how the mix was achieved. He recalled getting a call {{from one of the}} show's producers who were looking for specialized sound arrangements to acquire an authentic live concert feeling for the release. Riordan remembered that the main difficulty was trying to preserve the [...] "craziness" [...] of the audience and Gaga's fans, and their screaming during the concert, nevertheless make the music of the show primary. His team used Lossy which did not use compression, instead one-to-one audio mixing giving the whole sound system [...] "much more of an impactful experience". Riordan decided to engineer the concert sound as [...] "center-channeled" [...] since Gaga did not use backing audio, resulting in the listener getting the whole impact of her vocals, when listened with a headphone. Other difficulty faced by team included converting the heavy production of Gaga's songs to a live format and utilizing the singer's bands. [...] "You also have the crowd, the house [...] going nuts and all the reverberations at Madison Square Garden, so it was really <b>difficult</b> <b>for</b> <b>me</b> to figure out globally how real, how dry, how punchy can we get this thing to sound", he added. Initially Riordan had featured more of the live instrumentation and mixed the songs a number of times, however felt that they needed a dry reverb hence he pondered on the mix along with co-producer coming to a consensus regarding the sound. According to Riordan, the mixing process was approved by Gaga who watched the cuts while travelling on the tour however, she did not ask Riordan to change anything, unlike previous projects the engineer had undertaken. The 5.1 mix was further orchestrated by using the sound recordings from the microphones placed around the audience members in Madison Square Garden, giving a new dimension to the surround sound in the Blu-ray.|$|E
