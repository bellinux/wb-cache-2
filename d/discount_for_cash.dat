There were more serious anxieties, however, to trouble him than these. He had no reason to complain of the beloved object herself. Not twelve hours since he had said to Regina, with a voice that faltered, and a heart that beat wildly, [...] "Are you fond enough of me to let me marry you?" [...] And she had answered placidly, with a heart that would have satisfied the most exacting stethoscope in the medical profession, [...] "Yes, if you like." [...] There was a moment of rapture, when she submitted for {{the first time}} to be kissed, and when she consented, on being gently reminded that it was expected of her, to return the kiss--once, and no more. But there was also an attendant train of serious considerations which followed on the heels of Amelius when the kissing was over, and when he had said goodbye for the day.|$|E

Then, when the other children cried because they did not get anything, and the parents affected surprise (as if they really believed in the venerable fiction), Johnny was too manly to utter a whimper: he would simply slip out of the back door, and engage in traffic with affluent orphans; disposing of woolly horses, tin whistles, marbles, tops, dolls, and sugar archangels, at a ruinous <b>discount</b> <b>for</b> <b>cash.</b> He continued these provident courses for nine long years, always banking his accretions with scrupulous care. Everybody predicted he would one day be a merchant prince or a railway king; and some added he would sell his crown to the junk-dealers.|$|E

50|$|The Union Pacific (UP) land grant gave it {{ownership}} of 12,800 acres per mile of finished track.

The UP's goal was {{not to make a}} profit, but rather to build up a permanent clientele of farmers and townspeople who would form a solid basis for routine sales and purchases. The UP, like other major lines, opened sales offices in the East and in Europe, advertise heavily, and offered attractive package rates for farmer to sell out and moved his entire family, and his tools, to the new destination. In 1870 the UP sold rich Nebraska farmland at five dollars an acre, with one fourth down and the remainder in three annual installments. It gave a 10 percent <b>discount</b> <b>for</b> <b>cash.</b> Farmers could also homestead land, getting it free from the federal government after five years, or even sooner by paying $1.50 an acre.

European ethnics comprised half of the population of Nebraska in the late 19th century. Married couples were usually the homesteaders, but single women were also eligible on their own.|$|E

50|$|Complications are {{possible}} in various circumstances. For example, {{the interest rate}} <b>for</b> <b>discounting</b> <b>cash</b> receipts might be greater than the interest rate <b>for</b> <b>discounting</b> expenditures, because future inflows may be borrowed against while currently available funds may be invested temporarily pending use for future expenditures, and borrowing rates may exceed investment returns.|$|R
40|$|Discounting {{cash flows}} {{requires}} an equilibrium model {{to determine the}} cost of capital. The CAPM of Sharpe and the intertemporal asset pricing model of Merton (1973) offer a theoretical justification <b>for</b> <b>discounting</b> at a constant risk adjusted rate. Two problems arise with this application. First, <b>for</b> mean reverting <b>cash</b> flows the risk adjustment is unknown, and second, if the present value is compounded forward then the distribution of future wealth is likely right skewed.

Mansurov (2011) proposed different criteria for competitive evaluation of industrial agricultural companies by decision-makers such as project initiators, business owners and government organizations.

Under a portfolio constraint limiting investment of the Center country in the stock markets of the Periphery, stock prices also exhibit a flight to quality.

Cataloged from PDF version of Internship report. Includes bibliographical references (page 23 - 24). While preparing this report I gained first-hand knowledge about the Steel industry and was confronted {{for the first time}} with the commercial world. Besides I learnt how to work under pressure and cooperate in a team. SAS Group which was started small in 1987 in Comilla, has made its way around the country ranging from Billet to unique steel bars special in Bangladesh. What started because of the lack of cash capital ended up in an asset which worth around Tk. 800 crore. This eventually led to bigger popularity and connections to wealthier customers. Overpriced products however along with the increased number of companies offering branded steel bars is eventually becoming a threat to SAS’s share in the market. Still so, SAS manages to attract its clients through promised quality, reasonable <b>discounts</b> <b>for</b> <b>cash</b> purchases and long term relationship of value and bonding. And not to forget, SAS is sustained through recession phase because of its advanced technology, unique product and service towards customer by creating a bond which is to be forever. Lack of advertising activities is the weakness of this company. But they are currently planning something big. The past 3 years and 8 months was something unforgettable to me due to the bonding with some people with extremely beautiful heart and their help in this entire period can’t be paid in return. The work pressure was a lot, but what delights me is the valuable learning, which I believe will work as competitive advantages for me. Saki RezwanaB. Business Administratio...|$|R
30|$|Further, {{research}} does {{support the}} widespread practice among biotech industry analysts to base firm valuation either on existing cash flows (based {{on the assumption}} that future success can be predicted from past performance) or on cash flows based on market data that can be more readily measured, such as revenues expected from drugs that are near FDA approval and thus market launch (Löfqvist, 2009). This is particularly the case in the biotech industry where “go/no go” decisions are stage-gated to each phase of product development. 2 Analysts also may overestimate <b>discount</b> rates <b>for</b> <b>cash</b> flows from early stage products, thus dooming them to rejection because their lengthy time lines result in low net present values. Each of these traditional valuation practices may lead to under valuation and thus underinvestment in earlier stage drug development projects, even though some will offer high or breakthrough innovation potential with the option to abandon them at multiple stages of development (Newton et al. 2004).|$|R

We examine in detail the proper <b>discount</b> rate <b>for</b> <b>cash</b> flows in perpetuity, the present value of tax savings and the calculation of terminal value, which is the value of the perpetuity. We compare the typical textbook proposals for calculating the value of a perpetuity and we found that there are significant deviations. We compare with the Miller and Modigliani (1961) plowback proposal adopted by Copeland et al. (2000). The findings contradict what is generally accepted in the literature. ...|$|R

50|$|In the 1990s, noted Gessen, “Khodorkovsky made {{millions}} in currency trading. He also bought up privatization vouchers—documents distributed to every Russian citizen and entitling {{them to a}} share of the national wealth—which many Russians were happy to unload at a <b>discount</b> <b>for</b> ready <b>cash.</b> Khodorkovsky eventually acquired controlling stakes in some 30 companies. When Russia staged its greatest property giveaway ever, in 1995, Khodorkovsky was poised to take advantage of that too.” As Gessen explained, the Russian government, after the fall of Communism, “still nominally controlled Russia’s largest companies, though they had been variously re-structured, abandoned, or looted by their own executives.” A dozen men, the “new oligarchs”, including Khodorkovsky, hit upon the stratagem of lending the government money against collateral consisting of blocks of stock that amounted to controlling interests in those companies. The oligarchs and government both knew that the government would eventually default and that the firms would thus pass into the oligarchs' hands. “By this maneuver”, wrote Gessen, “the Yeltsin administration privatized oil, gas, minerals, and other enterprises without parliamentary approval.” This was how Khodorkovsky came to own Yukos.|$|R
5|$|On July 16, 2008, Miami-Dade Transit {{announced}} that it would be replacing all fare collection methods with the Easy Card system by late 2009. The system replaces the old cash and token-based system with one that automatically deducts fares at Metrorail fare gates from a reloadable card. The final station to start fare gate installation was Government Center on August 2, 2009. Since the system launch on October 1, 2009, all passengers using Metrorail must use either an Easy Card or Easy Ticket to enter stations. For almost the full first year of use, the Easy Card ticket vending machines allowed anyone to purchase thousands of dollars worth of Easy Cards by credit card without entering a PIN or billing zip code, which led to credit card thieves putting high dollar values on Easy Cards and selling them at a <b>discounted</b> rate <b>for</b> <b>cash.</b> Miami-Dade Transit initially mitigated this issue by limiting credit card transactions to three per day and a value limit of $112, and later by requiring zip code verification for all cards.|$|R

First, our model allows direct inference about relevant real-world probabilities (e. g., of success in a real-option project, of default on a corporate bond, or of an American-style option finishing in the money). Second, practitioners using our model for corporate real-option applications completely avoid the managerial anxiety that competing risk-neutral models generate when they use risk-free <b>discount</b> rates <b>for</b> risky <b>cash</b> flows.
