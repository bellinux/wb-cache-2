DBVPG 6662 has a defective sulfate transport system, whereas DBVPG 6739 barely grew on sulfate. They were compared for {{the ability to}} use dibenzothiophene (DBT) and related organic sulfur compounds as sulfur sources. In the presence of glucose as a carbon source and DBT as a sulfur source, strain DBVPG 6662 grew better than DBVPG 6739. In the presence of thiosulfate as a sulfur source, the two yeast strains did not use DBT, DBT-sulfone, benzenesulfonic acid, biphenyl, and fluorene. When the two strains were grown in the presence of glucose, strain DBVPG 6662 transformed 27 % of the DBT present (10 μM) at a rate of 0. 023 μmol liter− 1 h− 1 in 36 h. Traces of 2, 2 ′-dihydroxylated biphenyl were transiently accumulated under these conditions. When the same strain was grown on glucose {{in the presence of a}} higher concentration of DBT (0. 5 g liter− 1), mainly in an insoluble form, the whole surface of the DBT crystals was colonized by a thick mycelium. This adherent structure was imaged by confocal microscopy with fluorescent concanavalin A, a lectin that specifically binds glucose and mannose residues. When DBVPG 6662 was grown on glucose in the presence of a commercial <b>emulsion</b> <b>of</b> <b>bitumen,</b> i. e., orimulsion, 68 % of the benzo- and dibenzothiophenes and DBTs was removed after 15 days of incubation. The fungus adhered by hyphae to orimulsion droplets. When cultivated in the presence of commercial emulsifier-free fuel oil containing alkylated benzothiophenes and DBTs and having a composition similar to that of orimulsion, strain DBVPG 6662 removed only 11 % of the total organic sulfur that occurs in the medium and did not adhere to the oil droplets. These results indicate that strain DBVPG 6662 is able to utilize the organic sulfur of DBT and a large variety of thiophenic compounds that occur extensively in commercial fuel oils by physically adhering to the organic sulfur source...|$|E

Situated in Yverdon-les-Bains (Switzerland), the solar installation aims to provide up to 60 % of the thermal energy demand of the site. Coupled with a gas boiler, the solar collectors were {{designed to meet the}} energy needs of an onsite building, and to ensure constant temperature <b>of</b> a <b>bitumen</b> tank and two <b>emulsions</b> tanks (mixture <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> and water). In order to analyse and optimise the thermo-economic and environmental efficiency of this installation, a R&D project funded by the Swiss Federal Office of Energy was launched in 2014. This article gives an overview of the project objectives and describes the solar thermal installation and its operating modes. It also presents the numerical model and the first experimental results. First observations have revealed a thermal installation operating well behind its expected targets. Typically, the solar collector efficiency at temperatures above 200 °C is 50 % lower than expected since it is operating under non-optimal conditions. Some technical dysfunctions have also been detected in the control system of one of the storage tanks. Consequently, a thorough evaluation of the operation of the installation was conducted to identify any other anomalies. In parallel to this work, the numerical model of the installation was developed and is currently under validation against the ongoing experimental measurements. Preliminary simulations of the installation in its current state have showed a solar yield nearly 2 times lower than expected, confirming the existence of anomalies in the running of the installation...|$|R

30|$|The rheogram and {{shear rate}} {{behavior}} <b>of</b> post processed <b>bitumen</b> in a sonochemical reactor system was studied {{over a wide}} range of shear rates. The measurement was conducted in varying speed mode condition and the values of shear rate and shear stress were obtained. Figures  1 and 2 illustrate rheogram and shear rate behavior <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> sonicated under different frequencies and power inputs. The results showed that the viscosity for a given shear rate decreased in bitumen sonicated under different frequencies and power inputs. The decrease in viscosity during sonication treatment <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> can be attributed to higher disintegration of asphaltene flocs. There are studies reported the dependency <b>of</b> viscosity <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> upon its asphaltene content [12, 14, 15]. Hence, during the sonication treatment <b>of</b> <b>bitumen,</b> the dissolution <b>of</b> asphaltenic components occurs resulting in breakdown of asphaltene molecules to lighter molecules leading to decrease in viscosity in the medium. Argillier et al. [2] conducted a rheological study of several heavy oils and concluded that the asphaltene content was a controlling factor for viscosity. Hence, sonication treatment <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> under different sonication frequencies and power inputs decrease the asphaltene content <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> leading to higher viscosity change.|$|R

40|$|Abstract. Water {{damage of}} asphalt {{concrete}} pavements {{has been one}} of the major distresses in highway engineering. Engineering experiences and research results indicate that this damage is due to the extortionate air voids <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. Paranormal porosity of asphalt mixture is largely the result of the poor controlling of compact degree during paving process. The quality of asphalt pavement is subjected to the controlling methods <b>of</b> compacting <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. Ultrasonic is an excellent method for non-destructive testing used in various engineering fields. It is also a potentially effective tool to be applied in the control and evaluation of the compaction quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. This paper presents the results of a study aimed at the applicability of ultrasonic technology for evaluation of porosity and compaction quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures. It is shown that this technology, which has been successfully used for many years for evaluation of Portland concrete structures, might be used in asphalt pavement engineering to provide a simple, quick, and objective methodology for control and evaluation of the compact quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> mixtures.

As a developing nation durability and long term performance of roads are very much important to the country. In Sri Lanka flexible pavements are the frequently used for road construction. In flexible pavement bitumen and aggregate are the main ingredients for surface layer. The quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> for roads is assessed using penetration grading system which was initiated in early 19 th century. The quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> and the method <b>of</b> grading <b>bitumen</b> in Sri Lanka have made several discussions among the professionals because of the premature failures on some major roads. In this research twenty three bitumen samples were collected from various construction sites and tests were carried out to assess their quality. A sample of test reports issued by the bitumen suppliers were also taken in to consideration. Penetration test, Softening point test and Viscosity test were carried out using the collected samples. Penetration and Softening Point were assessed using the local bitumen specifications and viscosity was assessed based on the requirements of viscosity grading system. The Quality <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> was further analysed using the temperature susceptible measures such as Penetration Index, Viscosity Temperature Susceptibility and Pen-Vis Number. Relationship of temperature susceptibility measures were carried out using statistical means. Behaviour <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> at operation level was analysed using equi-viscous method of Asphalt Institute MS- 2. Indirect methods were used to obtain the stiffness <b>of</b> <b>bitumen</b> and asphalt concrete. Stiffness measures were analysed with climatic considerations and traffic loading.
