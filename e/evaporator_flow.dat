40|$|A new {{desalination}} {{system has}} been proposed and designed for converting sea water into fresh water utilizing the waste heat of internal combustion engines. The desalination process {{is based on the}} evaporation of sea water under a very low pressure (vacuum). The low pressure is achieved by using the suction side of a compressor rather than a commonly used vacuum pump. The evaporated water is then condensed to obtain fresh water. The effects of operational variables such as evaporator temperature, condenser temperature, vacuum pressure, and flow rate of both evaporator and condenser on the yield of fresh water are experimentally investigated. It is found that decreasing the vacuum pressure causes {{a significant increase in the}} yield of fresh water.

HSPF was calculated using a modified version of the ANSI/AHRI 210 / 240 method, and parametric studies were performed to better understand the seasonal performance with a focus on comparing vapor injected and single stage system configuration. It was found that part load degradation and reduced capacity at low ambient temperature are factors that can degrade the seasonal performance. The increase in heat pump COP for the vapor injected configuration leads to only a small benefit - the main contributor to the increased HSPF of the vapor injected system configuration is its increased capacity towards low ambient temperatures.

With restructuring of electrical supply {{and in some cases}} because of local fuel supply constraints, some of these boilers are run for only two shifts per day and this entails warm start ups. A reasonable objective is to bring the plant online as quickly as possible within the equipments constraint and without risk of tripping major plant equipment such as feed pumps and circulation pumps. The project required the development of a model accurate enough to represent the boiler thermal dynamics.

Varying {{the capacity of}} vapor compression systems enables operation at lower pressure ratios, or low lift, which fundamentally improves the coefficient of performance of the system by reducing the required compressor work while providing a similar cooling effect. This is illustrated in Figure 1, which shows conventional and low-lift vapor compression cycles for refrigerant R 22. A cycle with a lower condensing temperature, higher evaporating temperature, and/or slower compressor speed (the low-lift cycle) can achieve a similar (or even greater) cooling effect (the area below the evaporation process line) {{to that of the}} conventional cycle (the area inside the cycle polygon) with less compressor work.

40|$|Liquid {{recirculation}} is {{a method}} of improving evaporator performance by supplying the evaporator with more liquid than is evaporated. The excess liquid, which is generally provided {{by means of an}} externally driven, mechanical pump, eliminates dryout and increases overall heat transfer coefficient in the evaporator. Liquid recirculation is common in large-scale industrial refrigeration systems, where the additional cost and complexity of the pump is justified by the large size of the system. However, liquid recirculation has yet to gain widespread application in small-scale systems, such as residential or automotive air conditioning. The use of an ejector to provide the recirculation effect rather than a mechanical pump can help liquid recirculation systems gain consideration for small-scale systems. However, the performance of liquid recirculation cycles with and without ejectors for small-scale systems has yet to be thoroughly investigated. This paper presents the results of an experimental and numerical study of the effect of liquid recirculation on the performance of air condition cycles. The refrigerant R 410 A, commonly considered for residential systems, is used as the working fluid. A numerical model of a liquid recirculation cycle, capable of accounting for heat transfer and pressure drop effects in the evaporator, was developed and used to predict the effect that recirculation ratio (ratio of total <b>evaporator</b> mass <b>flow</b> rate to mass flow rate of vaporized liquid) has on cycle COP. A liquid recirculation cycle with a mechanical pump was constructed and tested at various <b>evaporator</b> mass <b>flow</b> rates for a fixed cooling capacity in order to see experimentally the effect of recirculation ratio on the COP of the cycle.

A typical design of a CPL is composed of a capillary evaporator, a condenser, a two-phase reservoir, and liquid and vapor lines.

The fundamental principles of the proposed modeling are: The overall pressure drop in the loop must be less than the maximum capillary pressure in order to ensure that the system will operate continuously. The major components of the CPL pressure drop are related to the flow in the wick structure, condenser, vapor and liquid lines.

It is investigated experimentally {{the effects of}} gas mixture rate, evaporator air inlet temperature (from 24 to 32 Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C), <b>evaporator</b> air mass <b>flow</b> rate (from 0. 58 to 0. 74 Ã‚Â kg/s), condenser air inlet temperature (from 22 to 34 Ã‚Â Ã‚Â°C) and condenser {{air mass flow rate}} (from 0. 57 to 0. 73 Ã‚Â kg/s) on the coefficient of performance (COP) and exergetic efficiency values of vapor compression heat-pump systems. To determine the effect of the chosen parameters on the system and optimum working conditions, an experimental design method suggested by Genichi Taguchi was used. In this study, it was observed that the most effective parameters are found to be the condenser air inlet temperature for COP and exergetic efficiency.

40|$|In this dissertation, a {{mathematical}} model was presented to simulate the steady state performance of a cross flow three-pass serrated plate fin compact <b>evaporator.</b> The refrigerant <b>flows</b> in three passes and the air flows in a single pass. The principle of the model was to divide the evaporator into 3 zones corresponding {{to each of the}} three refrigerant flow passes and to divide the third zone (the last zone before the refrigerant leaves the evaporator) into two sub zones - the two-phase sub zone and the single phase vapor sub zone. The fluid properties in a given zone are considered to be constant and uniform in that zone. The energy conservation equations were solved in each zone. Each zone's air flow outlet properties were the airflow inlet properties for the next zone while each zone's refrigerant outlet properties were the refrigerant inlet properties for the next zone. The results were compared to experimental data...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{describes}} thermal vacuum {{testing of}} a proto-flight miniature loop heat pipe (MLHP) with two evaporators and two condensers designed for future small systems applications requiring low mass, low power and compactness. Each evaporator contains a wick with an outer diameter of 6. 35 mm, {{and each has}} its own integral compensation chamber (CC). Miniaturization of the loop components reduces the volume and mass of the thermal system. Multiple evaporators provide flexibility for placement of instruments that need to be maintained at the same temperature, and facilitate heat load sharing among instruments, reducing the auxiliary heater power requirement. A flow regulator is used to regulate heat dissipations between the two condensers, allowing flexible placement of radiators on the spacecraft. A thermoelectric converter (TEC) is attached to each CC for control of the operating temperature and enhancement of start-up success. Tests performed include start-up, power cycle, sink temperature cycle, high power and low power operation, heat load sharing, and operating temperature control. The proto-flight MLHP demonstrated excellent performance in the thermal vacuum test. The loop started successfully and operated stably under various evaporator heat loads and condenser sink temperatures. The TECs were able to maintain the loop operating temperature within b 1 K of the desired set point temperature at all power levels and all sink temperatures. The un-powered evaporator would automatically share heat from the other powered <b>evaporator.</b> The <b>flow</b> regulator was able to regulate the heat dissipation among the radiators and prevent vapor from flowing into the liquid line...|$|R
