5|$|On 14 February 1943, Mayer {{shot down}} three RAF Hawker Typhoons, {{claiming}} his 60th to 62nd victories. Following his 63rd victory {{he was awarded}} the Knight's Cross of the Iron Cross with Oak Leaves on 16 April 1943, the 232nd officer or soldier of the Wehrmacht so honored. The presentation was made by Adolf Hitler <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> the Reich Chancellery in Berlin on 11 May 1943. Mayer was then promoted to Major (major) on 1 June 1943.|$|E
5|$|Allied forces sent {{to disarm}} the Japanese and {{repatriate}} {{prisoners of war}} arrived in Indonesia in September 1945. In Semarang, {{this led to a}} conflict between Japanese forces and Indonesian rebels, that began on 15October; the Indonesians aimed to confiscate the Japanese weapons. Allied forces began landing in the city on 20October 1945; a small group was sent to Gedangan to speak with Soegijapranata. Concerned with civilian suffering, the vicar apostolic told the Allies that they must stop the battle; the Allies could not comply as they did not know the Japanese commander. Soegijapranata then contacted the Japanese and, that afternoon, brokered a cease-fire agreement <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> Gedangan, despite Indonesian forces' firing at the Gurkha soldiers posted in front of the building.|$|E
5|$|In Spoke City, Thomas Prescott accepts an {{apparently}} innocent hitch-hiker into his car. The stranger's true intentions are revealed when he attaches a metal bracelet to Prescott's wrist, warning {{him that it}} contains a powerful explosive charge that is due to detonate in 30 minutes; the key to unlock it will be found <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> the Hudson Building. Speeding to his workplace with the police in pursuit, Prescott removes the bracelet and leaves it in a filing cabinet. The device explodes as he is returning to the ground floor in a lift: the top levels of the Hudson Building are incinerated, and Prescott is plunged {{to the bottom of}} the lift shaft, ten storeys underground.|$|E

5|$|Smyth sent {{an outline}} and rough {{draft of the}} report to Groves for {{approval}} in August 1944, followed in February 1945 by drafts of the first twelve chapters, leaving only the final chapter to be completed. Groves and Conant reviewed the drafts, and made several criticisms. They {{felt that it was}} too technical for general readers, did not mention the names of enough participants, and dwelt too much on the activities at the Los Alamos Laboratory. Groves was particularly anxious that deserving people be mentioned, as he felt that this would lessen the danger of security breaches. After Smyth made a series of changes in response to this, Groves sent the manuscript to his scientific adviser, Richard Tolman. Tolman was assisted by two physicists who were working <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> the National Defense Research Committee as technical aides, Paul C. Fine from the University of Texas, and William Shurcliff from Harvard University. They had the dual task of editing and censoring the manuscript.|$|E
5|$|With several names, such {{as former}} player Alan Curbishley, now {{linked with the}} job, Chairman Brown {{recruited}} from within the club, appointing reserve team coach Glenn Roeder as manager on 9 May 2001. He had already failed in management with Gillingham, where he lost 22 of the 35 games he managed, and Watford. His first big signings were the return of Don Hutchison for £5 million and Czech centre back Tomáš Řepka. Finishing seventh {{in his first season}} Roeder, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> Upton Park, suffered a blocked blood vessel in his brain. Now needing medical help and recuperation, former stalwart Trevor Brooking stood in as caretaker manager. Despite not losing another game, the Hammers were relegated {{on the last day of}} the season at Birmingham City with a record for a relegated club of 42 points. Ten seasons of top tier football were over. Many top players including Joe Cole, Di Canio and Kanoute all left the club.|$|E

25|$|After {{a launch}} {{of one of}} Goddard's rockets in July 1929 again gained the {{attention}} of the newspapers, Charles Lindbergh learned of his work in a New York Times article. At the time, Lindbergh had begun to wonder what would become of aviation (even space flight) in the distant future and had settled on jet propulsion and rocket flight as a probable next step. After checking with the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) and being assured that Goddard was a bona fide physicist and not a crackpot, he phoned Goddard in November 1929. Professor Goddard met the aviator soon after, <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> Clark University. Upon meeting Goddard, Lindbergh was immediately impressed by his research, and Goddard was similarly impressed by the flier's interest. He discussed his work openly with Lindbergh, forming an alliance that would last {{for the rest of his}} life. While having long since become reticent to share his ideas, Goddard showed complete openness with those few who shared his dream, and whom he felt he could trust.|$|E
25|$|In the night, {{just after}} the end of the meeting, Grandi met with Duke Pietro d'Acquarone: the meeting lasted until 6:00, and Grandi gave to the Duke one of the two copies of the OdG. At 7:00, d'Acquarone {{informed}} the King. The King at 9:00 called Badoglio, and told him that he would be the successor to Mussolini. The operation was due to start on 29 July. In the morning, Mussolini went to work at 8:00 as usual. On his desk he found a letter from Tullio Cianetti, withdrawing his vote for the OdG Grandi. Then, he ordered a search for Grandi several times, but although this was <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> Montecitorio, he let reply that he was not in Rome. It can be thought that the Duce wanted to give him the task to make contact with the Allies to prepare an armistice. Then Mussolini contacted the royal household in order to request an audience with the King, to report on the previous night's meeting. This call unsettled the plans of the King, who after several discussions decided to arrest the Duce on that same day. The audience was then given at 17:00 at Villa Savoia.|$|E
5000|$|Their {{accounts}} — many relayed here {{in their}} own words — reveal unwelcome romantic advances, unending commentary on the female form, a shrewd reliance on ambitious women, and unsettling workplace conduct, according to the interviews, as well as court records and written recollections. The interactions occurred <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> <b>at</b> Trump Tower, at his homes, at construction sites and backstage at beauty pageants. They appeared to be fleeting, unimportant moments to him, but they left lasting impressions on the women who experienced them.|$|R

25|$|On 3 December 1906 Alfred Richardson, {{was given}} {{permission}} {{to join the}} General and Finance Committee of the Northern Police Orphanage and Convalescent Home in Halifax. Chief Constables were encouraged to add their patronage. He wrote a booklet for his men which was an extract from a Council meeting held on 7 May 1906. It was written so that {{all members of the}} Force could know the regulations to which it was their duty to confirm. In 1907 there were several disturbances in Commercial Road, Halifax, during the tram drivers strike, causing much extra work for the police. The local press praised the constabulary for their restraints in handling this situation. By this time Richardson had increased further the reputation of the force as one with a strict sense of discipline and generally having a smart turn out, a sentiment reflected in the local newspapers. Richardson was known to have a love of horses, even to wearing spurs <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> Harrison Road. Halifax was soon to have its own horses and stables, rather than hire them. Horses were increasingly seen as effective in crowd control. In the annual inspection by His Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary Sir Llewelyn Atcherley in 1930, the Borough Mounted Police in full dress uniform were presented by Richardson to the Inspector.|$|E

500|$|Sellers {{was born}} on 8 September 1925, in Southsea, a suburb of Portsmouth. His parents were Yorkshire-born William [...] "Bill" [...] Sellers (1900–62) and Agnes Doreen [...] "Peg" [...] (née Marks, 1892–1967). Both were variety entertainers; Peg was in the Ray Sisters troupe. Although christened Richard Henry, his parents called him Peter, after his elder {{stillborn}} brother. Sellers remained an only child. Peg Sellers {{was related to the}} pugilist Daniel Mendoza (1764–1836), whom Sellers greatly revered, and whose engraving later hung <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office.</b> <b>At</b> one time Sellers planned to use Mendoza's image for his production company's logo.|$|E

He did not say where he had obtained the information and offered no evidence to support it. Trump compared the alleged intrusion to McCarthyism and Watergate.

General Kajitsuka Ryuji, Chief of the Medical Department of the Kwantung Army, at the Khabarovsk War Crime Trials in late 1949, in the 1930s, Nagata was the [...] "most active supporter" [...] of the program of conducting bacteriological or germ (biological) warfare put forth by Shiro Ishii. Ryuji testified that Ishii kept a bust of Nagata <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>offices</b> <b>at</b> Unit 731 headquarters in Pingfan District because he was [...] "so grateful" [...] to Nagata for his support. Ryuji identified Nagata as Chief of the Military Affairs Department of the Ministry of War.|$|R
500|$|Groves {{met with}} Major General Wilhelm D. Styer <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> the Pentagon {{to discuss the}} details. They agreed {{that in order to}} avoid suspicion, Groves would {{continue}} to supervise the Pentagon project. He would be promoted to brigadier general, as it was felt that the title [...] "general" [...] would hold more sway with the academic scientists working on the Manhattan Project. Groves therefore waited until his promotion came through on 23 September 1942 before assuming his new command. His orders placed him directly under Somervell rather than Reybold, with Marshall now answerable to Groves. Groves was given authority to sign contracts for the project from September 1, 1942.|$|E

500|$|Kippenberger became {{immersed}} in the Rangiora community, serving on the local council and becoming involved in various committees. He also retained {{an interest in the}} military and in 1924, joined the Territorial Force. [...] He firmly believed that a large scale conflict would once again occur in Europe, and he wanted to be prepared for this eventuality. Therefore, he built up an extensive military library and studied the theory of warfare and analysed past campaigns to ascertain strategy and tactics for a given situation. He noted the influence of landscape on the outcomes of battles and the qualities of a successful military commander. [...] He even set up a large sand table <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> his law practice for war gaming. [...] What he would learn from his studies, he put into practice in his training with the Territorials. By 1936, he was a lieutenant-colonel, commanding the 1st Battalion of the Canterbury Regiment.|$|E

500|$|Lemmie Quinn, foreman of {{the metal}} room, testified that he spoke briefly with Frank <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> 12:20. Frank had not {{mentioned}} Quinn when the police first interviewed him about his whereabouts at noontime on April 26. Frank had said at the coroner's inquest that Quinn arrived less than ten minutes after Phagan had left his office, and during the murder trial said Quinn arrived hardly five minutes after Phagan left. According to Conley and several experts called by the defense, {{it would have taken}} at least thirty minutes to murder Phagan, take the body to the basement, return to the office, and write the murder notes. By the defense's calculations, Frank's time was fully accounted for from 11:30a.m. to 1:30p.m., except for eighteen minutes between 12:02 and 12:20. Hattie Hall, a stenographer, said at trial that Frank had specifically requested that she come in that Saturday and that Frank had been working in his office from 11:00 to nearly noon. The prosecution labeled Quinn's testimony as [...] "a fraud" [...] and reminded the jury that early in the police investigation Frank had not mentioned Quinn.|$|E
500|$|When not touring {{missions}} or {{presiding over}} weekend stake conferences, Kimball spent weekdays answering correspondence {{at his home}} or working <b>in</b> <b>his</b> <b>office</b> <b>at</b> LDS Church headquarters in Salt Lake City. Kimball was noted among the apostles for his willingness to meet with church members struggling with serious personal problems, particularly married couples considering divorce or individuals wishing to confess serious violations of the LDS Church's law of chastity, which prohibits sexual relations outside of marriage. During his time as an apostle, Kimball met with thousands of church members and full-time missionaries who, for various reasons, felt their own local church leaders could not help them. Kimball [...] "had no patience for sin [...] almost infinite patience for sinners" [...] and often spent long hours with individuals in greatest distress. In 1959, Kimball and fellow apostle Mark E. Petersen were assigned to counsel church members dealing with homosexuality, which Kimball believed could, [...] "like all other problems," [...] be overcome through [...] "consistent prayerful exercise of self-restraint." [...] Kimball's experiences impelled his writing of The Miracle of Forgiveness, first published in 1969, which dealt frankly with the serious nature of church standards on sexual morality and counseled church members on avoidance of such problems and repentance.|$|E
