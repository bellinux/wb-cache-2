25|$|The {{opposition}} procedure before the European Patent Office (EPO) is a post-grant, contentious, procedure intended to allow any European patent to be centrally opposed. European patents {{granted by the}} EPO under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Convention</b> (EPC) may be opposed by any person from the public (no commercial or other interest whatsoever need be shown). This happens often when some prior art was not found during the grant procedure, but was only known by third parties.|$|E
25|$|The {{filing of}} an {{international}} application results in an international search performed by a patent office, accompanied with a written opinion regarding the patentability of the invention which {{is the subject of}} the application. An applicant may also request an international preliminary examination performed by a patent office. The PCT does not provide that the searches and examinations are to be performed by one central patent office, as the WIPO does not perform searches and examinations. In contrast, the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Convention</b> (EPC) places the European Patent Office (EPO) in charge of performing searches and examinations for European patent applications.|$|E
25|$|For instance, the European Patent Office (EPO), {{acting as}} ISA and IPEA, is not {{be obliged to}} search, by virtue of Article 17(2)(a)(i) PCT, or examine, by virtue of Article 34(4)(a)(i) PCT, any {{international}} application {{to the extent that}} the EPO considers that such application relates to subject matter which does not comply with the provisions of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Convention</b> to such an extent that it is not possible to carry out a meaningful search into the state of the art on the basis of all or some of the claims. The EPO acting as ISA or IPEA in the PCT procedure is therefore not obliged to search or examine some PCT applications when not equipped to do so.|$|E

The Republic of Moldova is {{a former}} member state. On 26 October 2011, the Republic of Moldova denounced the Eurasian <b>Patent</b> <b>Convention,</b> meaning that, since 26 April 2012, {{it is no longer}} party to the Convention. In the meantime, in December 2011, {{negotiations}} on a [...] "validation and co-operation agreement" [...] between the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office (EPO) and the Republic of Moldova were authorized by the Administrative Council of the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Organisation.|$|R
5000|$|The [...] "Luxembourg Conference on the Community Patent" [...] {{took place}} in 1975 and the <b>Convention</b> for the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> for the common market, or (Luxembourg) Community <b>Patent</b> <b>Convention</b> (CPC), was signed at Luxembourg on 15 December 1975, by the 9 member states of the European Economic Community at that time. However, the CPC never entered into force. It was not {{ratified}} by enough countries.|$|R
5000|$|In September 1949, French Senator Henri Longchambon {{proposed}} to the Council of Europe {{the creation of}} a <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Office. His proposal, known as the [...] "Longchambon plan", {{marked the beginning of the}} work on a <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> law aimed at a [...] "European patent". His plan was however not found to be practicable by the Councils Committee of Experts in patent matters. The meetings of the Committee nevertheless led to two Conventions, one on the formalities required for patent applications (1953) and one on the international classification of patent (1954). The Councils Committee then carried on its work on substantive patent law, resulting in the signature of the Strasbourg <b>Patent</b> <b>Convention</b> in 1963.|$|R
25|$|In addition, {{there are}} {{international}} treaty procedures, {{such as the}} procedures under the <b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> <b>Convention</b> (EPC) , that centralize some portion of the filing and examination procedure. Similar arrangements exist among the member states of ARIPO and OAPI, the analogous treaties among African countries, and the nine CIS member states that have formed the Eurasian Patent Organization. A key international convention relating to patents is the Paris Convention for the Protection of Industrial Property, initially signed in 1883. The Paris Convention sets out a range of basic rules relating to patents, and although the convention does not have direct legal effect in all national jurisdictions, {{the principles of the}} convention are incorporated into all notable current patent systems. The most significant aspect of the convention is the provision of the right to claim priority: filing an application in any one member state of the Paris Convention preserves the right for one year to file in any other member state, and receive the benefit of the original filing date. Another key treaty is the Patent Cooperation Treaty (PCT), administered by WIPO and covering more than 140 countries. The Patent Cooperation Treaty provides a unified procedure for filing patent applications to protect inventions in each of its contracting states. A patent application filed under the PCT is called an international application, or PCT application.|$|E

40|$|The {{dissertation}} examines current <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> {{court system}} and the possibilities of its improvement. First of all it identifies main problems of the existing fragmented patent litigation {{and in response to}} those findings, examines possible solutions to the situation. First, it deals with the possibility of adopting certain measures to improve the current situation, while maintaining the current system, in which national courts remain competent in patent disputes. The second option is linked to the issue of creating new specialized <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> jurisdiction. Thus the dissertation chronologically analyses individual legislative proposals and documents on the creation of a specialized <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> court system at supranational (EU) and international level. Namely Community <b>Patent</b> <b>Convention</b> (1975), Protocol on Litigation to the Agreement relating to Community Patents (1989), draft EPLA (<b>European</b> <b>Patent</b> Litigation Agreement 2003), proposals on decisions establishing Community Patent Court (2003) and draft Agreement on the <b>European</b> and Community <b>Patents</b> Court (2009).

40|$|It was the {{intention}} of the Treaty of Rome to create a common market in Europe, without barriers for the free circulation of goods. 40 years later, there is a common market with virtually no restrictions on the movement of people, goods, capital and services, there are good prospects for the common currency, but there is still not a common, unitary patent system in the European Union. "One market, one currency, one patent!" remains for the moment wishful thinking [[1]]. This is a key issue in the <b>European</b> <b>patent</b> arena.
