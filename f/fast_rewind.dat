50|$|Language {{laboratories}} in the 1970s and 1980s {{received a}} bad reputation due to breakdowns. Common problems stem from the limitations and relative complexity of the reel to reel tape system in use at that time. Design played a part too; the simplest language laboratories had no electronic systems {{in place for the}} teacher to remotely control the tape decks, relying on the students to operate the decks correctly. Many had no way to stop the tape running off the reel in <b>fast</b> <b>rewind</b> or forward wind, which meant time wasting and greater chances of failure through misuse.|$|E
40|$|In a Video-on-Demand (VoD) system, {{geographically}} distributed {{users can}} interactively access video files from a remote VoD server. In {{this article we}} present and compare the five most widely used methods {{to interact with the}} video programs with such operations as fast forward, <b>fast</b> <b>rewind,</b> and so on. To capture the interactive behaviour of a typical user, a Markov Modulated Poisson Process (MMPP) model is developed. Using this model as a workload generator, we evaluate the performance of alternative VCR methods in terms of picture quality, server capacity, and buffer and bandwidth requirements for a single user of an ATM network. Furthermore, we study the effectiveness of statistical multiplexing when multiple users are connected to the VoD server, and investigate both the impact of each VCR method on the multiplexing gain in terms of throughput utilization (i. e., maximum number of users), and the way the number of maximum multiplexed MPEG- 2 streams varies for different scheduling schemes applied by the VoD server. The article gives guidelines for the implementation of VCR commands in modern interactive multimedia retrieval systems...|$|E
40|$|AbstractThe present moral {{crisis of}} {{humanity}} will be closely considered in Ackroyd's Plato's Papers via Riemann's Theorem of Earth Mapping, Kelly's Personal Construct theory and Plato's Idea of the Third Man {{with a view}} to showing that only the generally assumed relationship between logos and ethos could rescue the mentality of the entire world and retrieve temporality and morality. For this approach to be successfully turned to good account the Aristotelian concepts of Logos (the thinking part of the intellect) mediating with Pathos (the feeling self) through the actions of his acting self, the personal Ethos, will be employed in relation to Ackroyd's character, Plato, the philosopher-orator. Within Ackroyd's novel, Plato appears as a credible detector of the dark mysterious evolution of mankind, being at the same time, an important narrative device in the author's aesthetic attempt at retrieving the far-off history of London. This is accomplished through the technique of <b>fast</b> <b>rewind,</b> Ackroyd moving backwards from the year 3700 up to 3500 B. C. For the objective of the paper to be properly covered (the present moral crisis and the philosophical solution offered to it, which is also the main argument of the paper), logos will be dealt with in relation to Kelly's alternative perspectives where two concepts are equally significant: determinism and free will. The results and conclusions are related to Ethos based on choice, the choice of reconstructing humanity by recuperating light which equates with rescuing spiritual and cultural values...|$|E

50|$|LINCtape is also {{remembered for}} its reliability, which {{was higher than}} that of the diskettes which supplanted it. LINCtape {{incorporated}} a very simple form of redundancy—all data was duplicated in two locations across the tape. LINC users demonstrated this by punching holes in a tape with an ordinary office paper punch. Tape damaged in this way was perfectly readable. The formatting track made operation almost independent of tape speed, which was, in fact, quite variable. There was no capstan; the motion of the tape during reading and writing was directly controlled by the reel motors. There was no <b>fast</b> forward or <b>rewind</b> - reading and writing was performed at <b>fast</b> forward and <b>rewind</b> speeds. In some modes of operation, the data transfers were audible over the built-in loudspeaker and produced a very characteristic series of harsh bird-like squawks with varying pitch.|$|R
