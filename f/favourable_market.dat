60|$|Tom turned {{towards him}} with a slowly rising flush of anger in his face. Three hundred pounds! Under the most <b>favourable</b> <b>market</b> {{conditions}} that he could imagine his prized Clover Fairy would hardly fetch a hundred, yet here {{was a piece of}} varnished canvas, painted by his half-brother, selling for three times that sum. It was a cruel insult that went home with all the more force because it emphasised the triumph of the patronising, self-satisfied Laurence. The young farmer had meant to put his relative just a little out of conceit with himself by displaying the jewel of his possessions, and now the tables were turned, and his valued beast was made to look cheap and insignificant beside the price paid for a mere picture. It was so monstrously unjust; the painting would never be anything more than a dexterous piece of counterfeit life, while Clover Fairy was the real thing, a monarch in his little world, a personality in the countryside. After he was dead, even, he would still be something of a personality; his descendants would graze in those valley meadows and hillside pastures, they would fill stall and byre and milking-shed, their good red coats would speckle the landscape and crowd the market-place; men would note a promising heifer or a well-proportioned steer, and say: “Ah, that one comes of good old Clover Fairy’s stock.” All that time the picture would be hanging, lifeless and unchanging, beneath its dust and varnish, a chattel that ceased to mean anything if you chose to turn it with its back to the wall. These thoughts chased themselves angrily through Tom Yorkfield’s mind, but he could not put them into words. When he gave tongue to his feelings he put matters bluntly and harshly.|$|E

30|$|In this study, {{we explore}} the last channel, namely {{the effect of}} {{naturalisation}} on the probability of participating in OJT. OJT is strongly correlated with firm-specific human capital and associated with higher wages (e.g. Parent 1999) and other <b>favourable</b> labour <b>market</b> outcomes such as promotions (Pfeifer et al. 2013). In the SOEP sample for immigrants, participating in OJT is correlated with a 10  % increase in wages (estimations available upon request) which is a stronger increase than switching from low to medium education. Therefore, higher participation rates of naturalised immigrants in OJT {{may be one of}} the reasons why naturalised individuals have more <b>favourable</b> labour <b>market</b> outcomes compared to non-naturalised immigrants (Steinhardt 2012). Up to this point, however, the literature has only rarely addressed the relation between naturalisation and OJT empirically.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{highlights}} {{that the}} development of ecotourism in Africa may considerably depend on the relations that African states maintain with the West. It illustrates this point by means of a case study of South Africa. Western tourism sanctions, imposed to punish the country for its racist policies, restrained the growth of ecotourism to South Africa for decades. In the post-apartheid era, South Africa's ecotourism sector has benefited from increased Western aid, <b>favourable</b> <b>marketing</b> opportunities and overly positive travel advisory arising from the currently highly cordial relations between South Africa and the West. The correlation between Western support to South Africa's tourism sector and the quality of South Africa's relations with the West also represents risks, however. If future South African policies were to produce conflict with Western states, renewed tourism-discouraging measures of Western states could affect South Africa's ecotourism sector. In addition, clashes with Western environmental NGOs over wildlife management could induce a tourism boycott. Altogether, South Africa's foreign relations are likely to continue to shape the development of ecotourism in the country...|$|R

Three scenarios post-crisis for the Thai Baht were identified by the nonlinear detection mechanism where the unobservable states are assumed to follow the Markov chain of events where past history does not matter. The states identified are described as panic, calm, and <b>favourable</b> <b>markets</b> for the currency. Furthermore, using the Markov-switching software developed by Krolzig (1998), it is possible to provide weak evidence that the nominal exchange rate moved to restore equilibrium in the fundamentals but not vice versa. The second section tested the productivity bias for the Thai quarterly data from 1993 - 2005, using Johansen cointegration method and found no evidence. The final section has the whole of the Thai economy specified and exogenous shocks sent to see the effects on the real exchange rate. In particular, a surge in productivity in the fully-specified economy causes the real exchange rate to appreciate, confirming the evidence for the productivity bias for the Thai Baht...|$|R

For practical reasons only one site of quality (IV) in one forest district was considered. This district had been used for timber production for 20 years. Through its favourable situation and therefore <b>favourable</b> <b>marketing</b> and ease of transport, and smooth labour relations, the yield of timber had been increased more {{than anywhere else in}} Java. These conditions were taken as an ideal standard. He tried to assess the stand value, the value of the normal wood stock, the forest value and the internal rate of return. For this purpose first the contrasts between the 'soil rent theory' and the 'forest rent theory' were examined. The first theory was held preferable. The calculations demonstrated 50 years as best for the financial rotation with an interest rate of 3 %, after which also the influences of the fallow period, the cutting period, the ringing period and preceding culture on the financial calculations were studied. The income from teak forestry was compared with those of other tropical cultures. Through these and other considerations Beekman arrived at conclusions on the justification for teak forestry on certain soils...|$|R
40|$|Feed {{shortage}} {{and poor}} quality of available feeds are major constraints for livestock {{production in the}} highlands of Ethiopia. A trial was conducted to assess if producing irrigated oat-vetch fodder during the dry period could adequately supplement the diet of fattening sheep and generate additional income for smallholders. A total of 14 farmers and 70 sheep (5 per farmer) {{were involved in the}} trial. The farmers supplemented their fattening sheep with 200 g of irrigated oat-vetch fodder per day for about 70 days. The mean daily body weight gain of the fattened sheep ranged from 52 to 110 grams. The partial budget analysis revealed that while farmers with good feeding management could earn an additional income in the range of ETB 55 – 161 per sheep, farmers with the lower rate of weight gain could lose up to ETB 58 per sheep unless purchase and sale prices remained constant. Sheep prices do, however, fluctuate, peaking during major holiday periods occurring during the dry season. Therefore, timing of the fattening period is essential to profitability, and supplemental irrigated fodder production offers smallholders opportunities to produce good quality feed and target <b>favourable</b> <b>markets</b> for fattened animals.

40|$|Abstract This {{assignment}} {{conducts a}} conceptual analysis {{based on the}} lecture performance “The Course You Lack” by The Theatre- & Cultural Company ClapClap. The assignment explores how the genre of lecture performance {{is a combination of}} knowledge dissemination and performances, and moreover how the genre seeks to enlighten a problem within the society. “The Course You Lack” examines the problem of complex relations between citizens and the government, opacity in structures, communication, and unavailable and difficult information. Based on a concept description the combination of the concepts performance, knowledge, active participation and use of digital instruments will be analysed. The analysis is based on theories from room enactment, the aesthetics of the lecture performance, audience participation, motivation, and knowledge development. Furthermore, the theoretical perspectives are complemented with empirical studies, which have provided insight to the audience’s preferences, knowledge, and relation to active participation and digital instruments. On the basis of the conceptual analysis, the results show how a realization of the lecture performance will need economical support, and therefore an arranged cooperation with relevant investors is preferred. In extension of this, there will be a number of considerations regarding direct marketing as the most <b>favourable</b> <b>marketing</b> channel. These result in a description of our marketing product: a video. The assignment concludes, in connection to the lecture performance, with a discussion regarding challenges and opportunities in a future perspective...|$|R
40|$|Objective of the Study: The {{purpose of}} this study was to discuss the means the {{implementation}} of good interpersonal investor communications and how a <b>favourable</b> capital <b>market</b> image is created. In recent years, there has been a growing interest in IR communication but despite the increase in academic research, there has only been a few studies focusing on the non-financial aspects, and particularly the image-building function. The main themes of the present study are how successful IR actions can create and maintain a <b>favourable</b> capital <b>market</b> image, what are the factors influencing it, and how to overcome threats to the relationship between a company and its financial stakeholders. Due to the regulated context of capital markets, image-building actions, similarly to all IR communication, must above all be based on facts. However, additional value is created through communication, which is why interpersonal relationships play a key role in creating the trust and credibility needed for a good capital market image. Methodology and the Theoretical Framework: The study was conducted as a qualitative research and the data was gathered through six semi-structured interviews with professionals, who in their line of work, regularly take part in IR communication. The theoretical framework of the study was constructed based on the previous literature in the field of IR and image-building. It elaborates how the financial data, image-building factors, interpersonal communication, management and its actions in crisis and change, all influence the capital market image in a complex ecosystem. Findings and Conclusion: The main findings of the study point out three sectors in implementation of successful IR communication and image-building; firstly, the basic communication needs to be on an adequate level and follow the regulations. The IROs need to be competent and the essential topics should be covered. These factors might not bring additional value but are a necessity. Secondly, succeeding well with factors such as consistency, credibility, openness and proactivity, can bring additional value to the company by improving the capital market image substantially. One crucial factor, trust, is built when actions and words are in proportion. Thirdly, the company should invest in communicating strategic changes, and especially in a crisis situation, as rebuilding a <b>favourable</b> capital <b>market</b> image takes a great deal of effort and time...|$|R
