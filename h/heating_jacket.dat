30|$|The {{objective}} of this test is to check how effective the smart LCM is by measuring fluid loss and pressure buildup once the LCM is activated with respect to time. This experiment is supposed to show the decrease in fluid loss that the drilling engineer will see once the fracture is effectively sealed. The <b>heating</b> <b>jacket</b> was preheated to 167  °F. The LCMs used in this test were a mixture of two different diameter sizes. These sizes were 3 and 5  mm from which 0.15 ppg (lb/gal) of each smart LCM size was added to 170  ml of water-based mud and inserted in the PPA cell. The PPA cell was then inserted in the <b>heating</b> <b>jacket</b> and left there for 30  min before applying pressure, to allow the heat {{to be transferred to}} the cell to simulate downhole conditions. The fluid loss and the maximum pressure the seal can hold with respect to time were recorded. The fluid loss was measured by pumping hydraulic fluid in the cell at a rate of 2  ml/s. Since the fracture is being sealed with time, fluid is being prevented from going through the fracture and the pressure is building up. This pressure build up is also recorded with respect to time.|$|E

40|$|The {{dehydrogenation}} behaviour of a cylindrical MgH 2 {{metal hydride}} tank is examined by {{taking into account}} five different heat management scenarios. A three-dimensional mathematical model, validated with experimental results is utilized to simulate the dehydrogenation process of an up-scale cylindrical Mg metal hydride tank. The scope {{of this study is}} to examine the dehydrogenation kinetics of 100 g of H 2 that have been stored to the tank. Five different heat management scenarios are examined and compared to each other: a base case where the heat source for the dehydrogenation process is an external heater (external jacket) surrounding the tank. The second case examines the effect of the radiation heat transfer arising from an operating Solid Oxide Fuel Cell (SOFC) to the metal hydride tank as a possible heat source for the dehydrogenation procedure. The third scenario takes into account the usage of internal heating tubes within the tank and the case of using 8 - 12 - 16 - 20 and 24 co-central tubes. For the fourth scenario, the optimum number of the co-central tubes from the previous case is used in combination with interior extended surfaces (fins). Finally, the last scenario involves the combination of the interior extended surfaces with the external jacket as a possible heat management technique. The results showed that when using the external <b>heating</b> <b>jacket</b> and the radiation heat from the SOFC the time for the hydride to release all the stored hydrogen (100 g) is greater than 15 min, while when using embedded heating tubes with oil as the flowing fluid the time is almost 7 min and when combine the embedded heating tubes with extended surfaces the time for the fully release of hydrogen can reduce more to 2 min.

40|$|Methods to {{counteract}} trapped ion {{effects in the}} High-Energy Storage Ring HESR are studied in the present report. The circulating antiproton beam ionizes the residual gas molecules of the UHV vacuum. The produced ions are trapped in the negative potentential well of the antiproton beam. Trapped ions can be extracted using either single isolated clearing electrodes or continuous clearing electrodes. In addition resonant transverse shaking of trapped ions and damping of coherent ion-beam oscillations {{can be used in}} order to reduce the adverse effects of trapped ions. In the region of dipole magnets the problem of trapped ions can be mitigated by upgrading the UHV vacuum, i. e. by sputtering thin-film NEG coatings onto the surfaces of the vacuum chamber and by using <b>heat</b> <b>jackets</b> along the beam tubes. The highest clearing efficiencies in dipole magnets can be achieved by extracting the trapped ions in the vertical direction along the magnetic field lines. A distinctive feature of the HESR ring is the internal PANDA target which deteriorates the vacuum by a huge local pressure bump. Near the PANDA target continuous clearing electrodes are necessary in order {{to counteract}} the high production rate of trapped ions. In the region of the electron cooler (EC) the optimum neutralization is reached if η = 1 /γ 2 e. Then, the azimuthal cross-field drift velocity of the electrons is zero and the space-charge potential is reduced. A stable neutralization with η = 1 /γ 2 e can be achieved using the Ion-Cyclotron-Resonance (ICR) heating. The ICR heating can be realized using the electrodes of the beam position monitors.
