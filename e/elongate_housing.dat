50|$|The Aka live in <b>elongated</b> <b>houses</b> {{made from}} bamboo, wood and cane leaves. Raised on {{platforms}} about 6 {{feet above the}} ground, the Aka house are further sub-divided into three sections. The granary is built away from the main house.|$|R
50|$|A short <b>elongated</b> <b>housing</b> {{forms the}} base of the {{actuator}} and includes an electrical gear drive and storage magazine for the spindle segments. The drive spins a helically grooved wheel that engages the similarly grooved inside face of the spindle segments. As the wheel spins it simultaneously pull the segments from their horizontal arrangement in the magazine and stacks them along the vertical path of a helix into a rigid tubular column. The reverse process lowers the column.|$|R

50|$|Bardarski Geran's {{characteristic}} architecture featuring <b>elongated</b> one-storey <b>houses</b> with Central European-style sharp-pointed {{roofs and}} straight streets owes much to Italian architect and engineer Leopold Forabosco who {{settled in the}} village after arriving in Bulgaria on Tsar Ferdinand's request.|$|R
40|$|A Dynamically Variable Spot Size (DVSS) {{laser system}} for bonding metal {{components}} includes an <b>elongated</b> <b>housing</b> containing a light entry aperture coupled to {{a laser beam}} transmission cable and a light exit aperture. A plurality of lenses contained within the housing focus a laser beam from the light entry aperture through the light exit aperture. The lenses may be dynamically adjusted to vary the spot size of the laser. A plurality of interoperable safety devices, including a manually depressible interlock switch, an internal proximity sensor, a remotely operated potentiometer, a remotely activated toggle and a power supply interlock, prevent activation of the laser and DVSS laser system if each safety device {{does not provide a}} closed circuit. The remotely operated potentiometer also provides continuous variability in laser energy output...|$|R
50|$|Gonzo is {{also the}} namesake to the CT-142 Bombardier Dash 8 used by the Canadian Armed Forces for Air Combat Systems Officer {{training}} due to the blue paint job and <b>elongated</b> nose <b>housing</b> a specialized radar. A similar flying example is the Gulfstream IV light jetliner bearing US registration N49RF, flown for severe weather research by the US Federal National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration, and is also named for Gonzo as portside nose art.|$|R
40|$|An {{instrument}} for measuring peak wind speeds under {{severe environmental conditions}} is described, comprising an <b>elongated</b> cylinder <b>housed</b> in an outer casing. The cylinder contains a piston attached to a longitudinally movable guided rod having a pressure disk mounted on one projecting end. Wind pressure against the pressure disk depresses the movable rod. When the wind reaches its maximum speed, the rod is locked by a ball clutch mechanism {{in the position of}} maximum inward movement. Thereafter maximum wind speed or pressure readings may be taken from calibrated indexing means...|$|R

The apparatus includes an elongated strip of magnetic material that is carried within an <b>elongated</b> tubular <b>housing.</b> A predetermined electrical signal is recorded along the length of said elongated strip of magnetic material. One end of the magnetic material is positioned closely adjacent to the electrically conductive member so that the magnetic field produced by current flowing through said electrically conductive member disturbs a portion of the recorded electrical signal directly proportional to the intensity of the lightning strike...|$|R
50|$|Next to the New Castle {{there is}} a yellow house known as the Summer Castle. It was built {{at the turn of}} the 18th or 19th century in style of classicism. The <b>elongated</b> wooden <b>house</b> was built by a master-builder from Cēsis, a man called the last of the Livs of Vidzeme, Mārcis Sārums. Initially Kropotkin's family used the {{building}} as a personal orthodox church after the completion of the New Castle in 1881. Services were held by the orthodox priest of Ledurga parish. The building also came under reconstruction when the Writers and Journalists Union obtained ownership and remodeled it to become a boarding-house.|$|R
25|$|In 1969, an {{improved}} version, the BN-2A Islander, conducted its maiden flight. It incorporated aerodynamic and flight equipment improvements, such as lower-drag engine cowlings and undercarriage, {{an improved}} interior, and an expanded rear baggage area with external access. In 1970, to improve hot-and-high performance, more powerful Lycoming O-540-K1-B5 engines were made available, alongside optional tiptanks and an <b>elongated</b> nose to <b>house</b> baggage.|$|R
50|$|Joslin Farm {{is located}} in a rural area of central Waitsfield, on 84 acre stradding East Warren Road south of Waitsfield village. The land east of the road is mostly open fields, while that to the west is open near the road, and wooded as it rises a hill. The small complex of farm {{buildings}} is set {{on the east side of}} the road, with the round barn at the northern end, and the <b>elongated</b> main <b>house</b> to its south. The barn is actually a twelve-sided timber frame structure, arranged as a bank barn with ground access on three levels. The house is a vernacular 2-1/2 story wood frame structure, with modest Greek Revival elements. It is extended to the north by a series of ells ending in a carriage barn.|$|R
50|$|Between 1905 and 1908 an <b>elongated</b> {{carriage}} <b>house</b> {{was built}} {{to the south of}} the station premises replacing a smaller wagon shed, of which the northern part was used for the dispatch of express freight and the southern part used for mail handling. This carriage house has been preserved and is a heritage-listed building. At the end of the 20th century, {{the northern part of the}} building was initially used for the sale of tickets and then as a waiting room until the depot was closed completely. The area of the carriage house has not been accessible to the public since 2007. In 2012 and 2013, the depot has been renovated under the Quaß training scheme (which provides training and work for the unemployed instead of social benefits) and converted into a workshop for the renovation of the entrance building.|$|R
50|$|Tsarist Russia {{settled the}} German {{migrants}} in Bessarabia according to plan. They kept {{land in the}} southern region, on assigned far, treeless steppe surfaces in the Southern Bessarabia (Budjak; germ. Budschak). In the first settlement phase, up to 1842, twenty-four main German colonies developed. The settlements were put on usually in a valley with gently sloping hills. The farms were up to 50 m wide, and bordered by acacias. While properties were only 20 metres wide at the roadside, they extended up to 250 metres in depth. The <b>elongated,</b> single-storey <b>houses</b> always stood with the gable facing the road. The whitewashed buildings were built of loam bricks or natural stone. On the farmyard were stables, threshing-rooms and a stockroom and wine cellar. In the rear part of an estate lay fruit and vegetable gardens and vineyards.|$|R
5000|$|... "The {{wonders of}} the city: the red stone walls, thick and high, around the palace. The west gate called Pura Waktra, {{overlooking}} a spacious ground, belted with trench. Brahmastana tree with bodhi tree trunk, lining along the square, neatly shaped. That is where the royal guards stay, constantly patrolling and guarding the paseban. On the north side stood a beautiful gate with ornate iron door. To the east is the high stage, with stone-lined floor, white and shiny. In the north, south from the marketplace, full with <b>elongated</b> <b>houses,</b> very beautiful. On the south a road intersection: a soldier hall stood, where they held a meeting every Caitra month." [...] Canto 8, stanza 1 and 2. The manuscript describes {{the capital city of}} Majapahit. According to the account of Prapanca in the Nagarakretagama poem, the royal compound was surrounded by a thick, high wall of red brick. Nearby was the fortified guard post. The main gate into the palace was located in the north wall, and was entered through huge doors of decorated iron. Outside the north gate was a long building where courtiers met once a year, a market place, and a sacred crossroads. Just inside the north gate was a courtyard containing religious buildings. On the western side of this courtyard were pavilions surrounded by canals where people bathed. At the south end a gate led to rows of houses set on terraces in which palace servants lived. Another gate led to a third courtyard crowded with houses and a great hall for those waiting to be admitted into the ruler's presence. The king's own quarters, which lay to the east of this courtyard, had pavilions on decorated red brick bases, ornately carved wooden pillars, and a roof decorated with clay ornaments. Outside the palace were quarters for Shiva priests, Buddhists, {{and other members of the}} nobility. Further away, and separated from the palace by open fields, were more royal compounds, including that of the chief minister Gajah Mada.|$|R
50|$|A {{variation}} of the GP-5 gas mask is the GP-5m, which features a circular piece of metal that contains a thin piece of plastic on the inside, which acts as a voice diaphragm ('voicemitter'), {{as well as the}} dubious design for ear holes, which compromised the seal of the mask. The military version of the GP-5 uses a near-identical facepiece but with an <b>elongated</b> filter <b>housing,</b> to which is fitted a hose which in turn connects to a tall can-type filter which remains supported in the mask's haversack whilst the mask is worn. The GP-5 and military version were issued respectively to the civilian population and armed forces of the Soviet Union and it's Warsaw Pact allies, among which they were given differing designations. The East German armed forces designated the military version the SchM41M, and the variant with small eyepieces and a voicemitter for those with a need to use optical equipment (i.e. officers - binoculars) was known as the SchMS.|$|R
500|$|The {{skull of}} a fully grown Edmontosaurus could be over a metre long. One skull of E. annectens (formerly Anatotitan) {{measures}} [...] long. The skull was roughly triangular in profile, with no bony cranial crest. Viewed from above, {{the front and}} rear of the skull were expanded, with the broad front forming a duck-bill or spoon-bill shape. The beak was toothless, and both the upper and lower beaks were extended by keratinous material. Substantial remains of the keratinous upper beak are known from the [...] "mummy" [...] kept at the Senckenberg Museum. In this specimen, the preserved nonbony part of the beak extended for at least [...] beyond the bone, projecting down vertically. The nasal openings of Edmontosaurus were <b>elongate</b> and <b>housed</b> in deep depressions surrounded by distinct bony rims above, behind, and below. In at least one case (the Senckenberg specimen), rarely preserved sclerotic rings were preserved in the eye sockets. Another rarely seen bone, the stapes (the reptilian ear bone), has also been seen in a specimen of Edmontosaurus.|$|R

40|$|This study {{uses the}} TRNSYS {{computer}} program, for the modelling and simulation {{of the energy}} flows of modern houses, to examine measures to reduce the thermal load. For the calculations, a typical meteorological year (TMY) and a typical model house are used. The measures examined are natural and controlled ventilation, solar shading, various types of glazing, orientation, shape of buildings, and thermal mass. In summer, ventilation leads to a maximum reduction of annual cooling load of 7. 7 % for maintaining the house at 25 Â Â°C. The effect depends on the construction type, with the better-insulated house saving a higher percentage. Window gains are an important factor and significant savings can result when extra measures are taken. The saving in annual cooling load, for a well-insulated house, may {{be as much as}} 24 % when low-emissivity double glazing windows are used, which are recommended since the payback period is short (3. 8 years). Overhangs may have a length over windows of 1. 5 m. In this way, about 7 % of the annual cooling load can be saved for a house constructed from single walls with no roof insulation. These savings are about 19 % for a house constructed from walls and roof with 50 mm insulation. The shape of the building affects the thermal load. The results show that the elongated shape shows an increase in the annual heating load, which is between 8. 2 and 26. 7 % depending on the construction type, compared with a square-shaped house. Referring to orientation, the best position for a symmetrical house is to face the four cardinal points and for an <b>elongated</b> <b>house</b> to have its long side facing south. In respect to thermal mass, the analysis shows that increasing the wall and roof masses and utilizing night ventilation is not enough to lower the house temperature to acceptable limits during summer. Also, the analysis shows that the roof is the most important structural element of the buildings in a hot environment. The roof must offer a discharge time of 6 h or more and have a thermal conductivity of less than 0. 48 W/mK. The life-cycle cost analysis has shown that measures that increase the roof insulation, pay back {{in a short period of}} time, between 3. 5 and 5 years. However, measures taken to increase wall insulation pay back in a long period of time, of about 10 years. ...|$|R
50|$|Scotland Neck Historic District is a {{national}} historic district located at Scotland Neck, Halifax County, North Carolina. It encompasses 249 contributing buildings and 1 contributing object in the central business district and surrounding residential sections {{of the town of}} Scotland Neck. The district includes notable examples of Greek Revival and Gothic Revival style architecture. Located in the district is the separately listed Hoffman-Bowers-Josey-Riddick House. Other notable buildings include the Fenner-Shields-Lamb House (1827); D. Edmondson Building (c. 1882), E. T. Whitehead drug store (c. 1901); Scotland Neck Bank (1914); Baptist Church (1917); Trinity Episcopal Church (1924); and town hall and fire station (1939), brick gymnasium and vocational building (1940), and one-story, <b>elongated</b> brick multiple <b>housing</b> unit (1943) built by the Works Progress Administration. The latter building was utilized as a prisoner-of-war camp during World War II.|$|R
40|$|The gross {{anatomy of}} the {{mastication}} system of the giant anteater (Myrmecophaga tridactyla) was examined by means of three-dimensional image analysis. The anteater rotates the mandibles medially and laterally to control its tongue when it is <b>elongated</b> and to <b>house</b> it when it is relaxed. Three-dimensional CT image analysis demonstrated that the shape {{and size of the}} oral cavity changes drastically when the mandibles are rotated. The oral cavity expands bilaterally when the dorsal part of the mandibles bend medially. Macroscopic observations and muscle-weight data supported the observation that the superficial temporal and medial pterygoid muscles act as the main medial and lateral rotators of the mandible, respectively. The low height of the mandibular ramus and the incomplete zygomatic arch in this species represent adaptations for the rotational movement of the mandibles, since they both contribute to the medially oriented transmission of force from the temporal muscles and to preventing collision between the mandibles and the cranium during the rotational movement...|$|R
50|$|The thermae were typical {{buildings}} of Roman civilisation and indispensable part of Roman urban life. Although {{the city of}} Salona at the time had multiple baths, best preserved and largest one are those {{in the eastern part}} of the city called the Great Thermae, built in the second or beginning of third century A.D. This building is rectangular in shape with three symmetrically arranged apses in the north and one in the west. To the north there was an adjoining <b>elongated</b> spacious room, <b>housing</b> a semicircular pool, the piscina, filled with cold water, the frigidarium. To the left there were two dressing rooms, with benches for sitting and openings in the wall for clothes. The room to the west was also used as a massage room, the unctorium. The room ending with an apse served both as a lounge and an exercise room. To the right there were hot baths and sauna: caldarium, tepidarium and sudatorium.|$|R
50|$|Rivet Ball was the {{predecessor}} program to Cobra Ball and was initiated {{with a single}} RC-135S (serial 59-1491, formerly a JKC-135A) on December 31, 1961. The aircraft first operated under the Nancy Rae project name as an asset of Air Force Systems Command and later as an RC-135S reconnaissance platform with Strategic Air Command under the project name Wanda Belle. The name Rivet Ball was assigned in January 1967. The aircraft operated from Shemya AFB, Alaska. Along with most other RC-135 variants, the RC-135S had an <b>elongated</b> nose radome <b>housing</b> an S band receiving antenna. The aircraft was characterized by ten large optically flat quartz windows {{on the right side}} of the fuselage used for tracking cameras. Unlike any other RC-135S, Rivet Ball also had a pleixiglass dome mounted top center on its fuselage for the Manual Tracker position. It holds the distinction of obtaining the very first photographic documentation of Soviet Multiple Reentry vehicle (MRV) testing on October 4, 1968. On January 13, 1969 Rivet Ball was destroyed in a landing accident at Shemya when it hydroplaned off the end of the runway with no fatalities.|$|R
50|$|In early 1941, the Italian Army {{requested}} that Fiat and Ansaldo develop {{a low profile}} 15 to 16 tonne LT tank to counter the faster and more heavily armed A-13 series tanks exemplified by the Crusader tank. Fiat-Ansaldo began the new tank project in June 1941 by creating a wooden mock-up on a M14/41 medium tank chassis, inclining the tanks armour plates to create a glacis. The armour remained, like other contemporary Italian tanks of the period, bolted rather than welded together and generally thinner than tanks of other countries. Many different engines, including petrol-fueled aircraft engines, were tested on the chassis before development of the Sahariano tank was halted. At the time of cancellation a 275 hp gasoline engine was being tested. An <b>elongated</b> M14/41 turret <b>housing</b> a 47 mm 47/40 L40 was tested on the Sahariano tank and would also {{be used by the}} M15/42 medium tank. There were plans to later fit a 75 mm gun on the production model of the Sahariano tank as well. The Sahariano was the first Italian tank to feature a modified Christie suspension system, a more robust and faster suspension system than the leaf spring bogies used on previous Italian tank designs. Ansaldo based the Saharianos suspension on British tanks encountered in North Africa and a captured Soviet BT-5 from the Spanish Civil War. By the time of the projects cancellation, the design looked very similar to their British counterparts but with a notably lower design profile, making the tank easier to conceal and more difficult to hit.|$|R
