40|$|The {{antiepileptic}} {{activity of}} the imidazole derivative <b>denzimol</b> has been evaluated in 10 patients with poorly controlled partial epilepsy by adding on the drug to the current therapy, in an open preliminary trial. A sustained drop in seizure frequency greater than 50 % occurred in 5 patients. Although <b>denzimol</b> increased blood concentrations of carbamazepine, correlation analysis indicated that the improvement was more likely due to intrinsic properties of <b>denzimol.</b> No severe side effects were reported, although several patients experienced nausea and vomiting, which caused 2 patients to drop out...|$|E

In this paper we report {{its use in}} six patients who were also taking carbamazepine and two patients taking phenytoin. There was a striking elevation of serum carbamazepine, carbamazepine- 10, 11 epoxide and phenytoin concentrations in all patients on the addition of <b>denzimol</b> therapy. The interaction with carbamazepine is greater in severity than any other reported to date and denzimol's interaction with both carbamazepine and phenytoin is likely to prove of major clinical significance...|$|E
