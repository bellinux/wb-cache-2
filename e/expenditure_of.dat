5|$|Assuming less {{load and}} rolling friction, Raepsaet, in contrast, calculates a maximum pulling force of 27kN, {{which would have}} needed a {{slightly}} smaller towing crew. Under these circumstances, the use of harnessed oxen—which has been refuted by Tolley {{on the basis of}} their relatively diminished pulling capabilities— would have become feasible.

5|$|By {{this time}} Port Darlington had become {{overwhelmed}} by the volume of imports and exports and work started in 1839 on Middlesbrough Dock, which had been laid out by William Cubitt, capable of holding 150 ships, and built by resident civil engineer George Turnbull. The suspension bridge across the Tees {{was replaced by a}} cast iron bridge on masonry piers in 1841. After three years and an <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> £122,000 (equivalent to £9.65m at 2011 prices), the formal opening of the new dock took place on 12 May 1842.

5|$|During {{the winter}} of 1861, Johnson tried mightily to assert the {{legitimacy}} of the fledgling government, but to no avail. Its jurisdiction extended only as far as the area controlled by the Confederate Army. Johnson came woefully short of raising the 46,000 troops requested by the Confederate Congress in Richmond. Efforts to levy taxes and to compel citizens to turn over their guns to the government were similarly unsuccessful. On January 3, 1862, Johnson requested a sum of $3million from the Confederate Congress to meet the provisional government's operating expenses. The Congress instead approved a sum of $2million, the <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> which required approval of Secretary of War Judah P. Benjamin and President Davis.|$|E
5|$|Each {{dealt with}} a {{different}} aspect of the tests. The Naval Ordnance Laboratory handled the blast measurement tests, while the Naval Research Laboratory conducted the radiation measurement experiments, and Argonne National Laboratory did gamma ray measurements. Edgerton, Germeshausen, and Grier were contractors hired to design and install the timing and firing systems. Seven experimental weapon assemblies and six cores were delivered to San Pedro, California, and loaded on the weapon assembly ship USS Curtiss, in February 1948, but the Atomic Energy Commission only gave permission for the <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> three cores in the tests.|$|E
5|$|Given {{the limited}} {{resources}} of many developing nations, funding vitally effects how emergency medicine {{fits into the}} health system. Preventive care is {{a crucial part of}} healthcare in developing countries, and {{it may be difficult to}} budget for emergency medicine without cutting into those resources. This is a particular problem for poorer nations such as Zambia, which had a per capita health <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> 23 US dollars in 2003. Regardless of the amount of preventive care available, health problems requiring immediate attention will still occur, and emergency medical programs could increase access to care. Kobusingye et al. argue that expanding emergency medicine does not need to be unreasonably expensive, particularly if developing countries focus on low-cost but effective treatments administered by first responders.|$|E

5|$|Himeji {{was heavily}} bombed in 1945, {{at the end}} of World War II, and {{although}} most of the surrounding area was burned to the ground, the castle survived intact. One firebomb was dropped {{on the top floor of}} the castle but failed to explode. In order to preserve the castle complex, substantial repair work was undertaken starting in 1956, with a labor <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> 250,000 man-days and a cost of 550 million yen. In January 1995, the city of Himeji was substantially damaged by the Great Hanshin earthquake, but Himeji Castle again survived virtually undamaged, demonstrating remarkable earthquake resistance. Even the bottle of sake placed on the altar at the top floor of the keep remained in place.|$|E
5|$|In {{the middle}} of June, City Council Speaker Gifford Miller visited the zoo, and {{in a press conference}} {{outlined}} some of the pragmatic consequences of closure: a savings estimated by the city of $6 million for both facilities that would be offset by a WCS estimated <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> $8 million, to decommission facilities and — on short notice — find homes for 160 displaced animals. If the estimates were correct, reasoning went, it would be cheaper to run the zoos than to shut them down.|$|E
5|$|It {{was widely}} {{believed}} that George would dismiss Walpole, who had distressed him by joining his father's government, and replace him with Sir Spencer Compton. George asked Compton, rather than Walpole, {{to write his}} first speech as king for him, but Compton asked Walpole to draft it. Caroline advised George to retain Walpole, who continued to gain royal favour by securing a generous civil list (a fixed annual amount set by Parliament for the king's official <b>expenditure)</b> <b>of</b> £800,000. Walpole commanded a substantial majority in Parliament and George {{had little choice but}} to retain him or risk ministerial instability.

5|$|Power was now wielded by {{the senior}} bureaucrats, who {{installed}} {{the weak and}} pliable al-Muqtadir on the throne. Over the next decades, the <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> both the court and the army increased, while maladministration and strife between military and bureaucratic factions intensified. By 932, when al-Muqtadir was assassinated, the Caliphate was effectively bankrupt, and authority soon devolved {{on a series of}} military strongmen who competed for control of the caliph and the title of amīr al-umarāʾ. This process culminated in the capture of Baghdad in 946 by the Buyids, who put an end to caliphal independence even in name. Thereafter the caliphs remained as symbolic figureheads, but were divested of any military or political authority or independent financial resources.|$|E
5|$|Prince George's County {{officials}} {{continued to}} worry that cutbacks in federal funding for mass transit might lead to the cancellation of the four proposed stations (Southern Avenue, Naylor Road, Suitland, and Branch Avenue) in the county.

Philip Waddilove, a former BBC radio and record producer, contributed £5,000 in return for associate producer billing. Although the film would be the biggest budgeted title in Tigon's history, for AIP their part of the budget represented a relatively small <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> money.

5|$|The committee's {{final report}} {{determined}} that along {{the whole of}} the rocky coast between Land's End and Hartland Point, Padstow was the only potentially safe harbour for the coasting trade when the most dangerous north-westerly onshore gales were blowing. It noted that Padstow's safety was compromised by the Doom Bar and by the eddy-forming effect of Stepper Point. The report recommended initial <b>expenditure</b> <b>of</b> £20,000 to cut down the outer part of Stepper Point, which, in conjunction with the capstans, bollards and mooring rings, would significantly reduce the risk to shipping.|$|E
