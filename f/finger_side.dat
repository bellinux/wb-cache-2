50|$|There {{are several}} {{opinions}} about how Sera Ella got its name. According to one, {{the name of}} the fall derives from the ‘Sera’ species of fish that inhabits the water. Another opinion is that the name Sera Ella explains that the beauty of this waterfall is just like the leaves of a sera tree (Lemon grass) hanging down. Some people also claim that because this waterfall reflects the way where a handful of Sera seeds falls down from the palm when it is lowered from the small <b>finger</b> <b>side</b> of the hand it got the name Sera Ella.|$|E
5000|$|Tapotement is a {{specific}} technique used in Swedish massage. It is a rhythmic percussion, most frequently administered {{with the edge of}} the hand, a cupped hand or the tips of the fingers. There are five types of tapotement including Beating (closed fist lightly hitting area), Slapping (use of fingers to gently slap), Hacking (use the edge of hand on pinky <b>finger</b> <b>side),</b> Tapping (use just fingertips) and Cupping (make your hand look like a cup and gently tap area). It is primarily used to [...] "wake up" [...] the nervous system and also as a stimulating stroke which can release lymphatic build up in the back.|$|E

25|$|In the Henry {{system of}} classification, {{there are three}} basic {{fingerprint}} patterns: loop, whorl, and arch, which constitute 60–65%, 30–35%, and 5% of all fingerprints respectively. There are also more complex classification systems that break down patterns even further, into plain arches or tented arches, and into loops that may be radial or ulnar, depending {{on the side of}} the hand toward which the tail points. Ulnar loops start on the pinky-side of the <b>finger,</b> the <b>side</b> closer to the ulna, the lower arm bone. Radial loops start on the thumb-side of the <b>finger,</b> the <b>side</b> closer to the radius. Whorls may also have sub-group classifications including plain whorls, accidental whorls, double loop whorls, peacock's eye, composite, and central pocket loop whorls.|$|R
50|$|In humans/animals this {{condition}} can present itself {{on one or}} both hands. The extra digit is usually {{a small piece of}} soft tissue that can be removed. Occasionally it contains bone without joints; rarely it may be a complete functioning digit. The extra digit is most common on the ulnar (little <b>finger)</b> <b>side</b> of the hand, less common on the radial (thumb) side, and very rarely within the middle three digits. These are respectively known as postaxial (little finger), preaxial (thumb), and central (ring, middle, index fingers) polydactyly. The extra digit is most commonly an abnormal fork in an existing digit, or it may rarely originate at the wrist as a normal digit does.|$|E
50|$|Utthita Parsvakonasana {{is usually}} {{performed}} in two parts, facing left {{and then again}} facing right. Begin standing with the both feet apart, approximately three to four ft. or one leg length. Starting with the left side, turn the left foot slightly to the right, and the right foot out to the right ninety degrees. Align {{the back of the}} left heel with the arch of the right foot. Bend the left knee over the left ankle, so that the left shin is perpendicular to the floor. Press and anchor the left and right football mound and heels to the floor in order to improve stability. Firm the thighs and spin the right thigh outwardly. Rotate the torso and squeeze the shoulder blades together against the back. Extend the right arm straight up toward the ceiling, turning the pinky <b>finger</b> <b>side</b> down parallel to the floor and reach the right arm energetically over the right ear. The left arm can either press into the floor, grasp the left ankle/foot, rest on the left thigh, or on top of a block. Stretch from the grounded right foot out to the finger tips of the right hand, lengthening the entire right side body. Turn the head and gaze above the right arm, which intensifies the twist. Actively push the left knee against the right arm, and tilt the tail bone towards the pelvis. Focus on the breath. Return to standing, the pose is then repeated on the left.|$|E

30|$|Similarly, {{from the}} {{accelerations}} at the <b>finger</b> <b>side,</b> ẍ_s 1 (t), following (2), we computed X̅_p 1 (s). We used G_ 1 (s) that was estimated {{for each participant}} in Experiment 1 to compute X̅_p 1 (s) for each participant.|$|E
30|$|In the low-frequency range (less {{than a few}} tens of Hertz), {{the normal}} and {{tangential}} deformation of the finger pad are not decoupled and collectively affect the deformation at the <b>finger</b> <b>side.</b> The normal deformation of the finger pad also leads to skin deformation at the <b>finger</b> <b>side.</b> Hence, a large normal deformation in the low-frequency range may interfere with the estimates of the tangential deformation of the finger pad. At high frequencies, the adverse effects of the normal deformation on the estimates of tangential deformation are minute, because this effect of normal deformation on the radial side is attenuated [22]. From this aspect, at a frequency range of less than a few tens of Hertz, the estimation method based on the tangential force is regarded as being better than our accelerometer-based method, although further comparisons {{would be necessary to}} draw a firm conclusion.|$|E

30|$|Figure  9 shows {{examples}} of the time-series data of the accelerations at the <b>finger</b> <b>side</b> and the tangential forces. Apparently, the fine material, which is cloth in the figure, exhibited smaller variations in the accelerations and forces than the rough material, which is the grating scale in the figure. Naturally, the skin accelerations and interaction forces depend on the materials, is as shown in these time-series data.|$|E
30|$|Another caution {{regarding}} the usage {{is the effect}} of rotation or the gradient of the fingertip while the participants tried to maintain the posture of their finger during the exploration in our experiments. The acceleration at the <b>finger</b> <b>side</b> is also affected by gravity, which {{should not be confused with}} that of the skin deformation. Although we used only one accelerometer, the simultaneous use of a 3 -axial accelerometer on the nail would be able to compensate for any adverse effects of the finger rotation.|$|E
30|$|We {{computed}} the Fourier transform of {{the outputs}} {{from the two}} accelerometers, Ẍ_s(s) and Ẍ_p(s), to acquire the accelerations of the skin deformations in the frequency domain. Following (1), we then computed the transfer function G_ 1 (s) of the fingertip. Note that this transfer function includes not only {{the properties of the}} fingertip but also those of the accelerometer attached to the <b>finger</b> <b>side.</b> Furthermore, the coherency between the input Ẍ_s(s) and output Ẍ_p(s) of the transfer function was computed to check the linearity between the input and output. We applied these computation procedures for the individual participants.|$|E

30|$|For each participant, the {{measured}} tangential force f_ 2 (t) was converted into the frequency domain by a Fourier transform and, according to (5), for each combination of participants and materials, we computed X̅_p 2 (s), that is, the finger pad’s deformation {{in the frequency}} domain. For this computation, we used the k and c values estimated in Experiment 2 for the individual participants. Because {{it was difficult to}} estimate m_p with our experimental setup, for the analysis in Experiment 3, we used a representative value taken from the literature [31]: m_p = 0.1 × 10 ^- 3  kg. This value is potentially determined by the weight of local epidermal tissue of finger pad [31], and it is unlikely to be affected by the mass of an accelerometer at the <b>finger</b> <b>side.</b>|$|E
30|$|A comparison, in Experiment 3, of the {{two types}} of {{estimate}} of a finger pad’s deformation indicated that our method, based on the accelerations at the <b>finger</b> <b>side,</b> can be applied to a deformation in excess of 23 – 50  Hz. In contrast, skin deformation at less than a few tens of Hertz, at which our method may incur significant errors, is regarded as being less effective for the perception of fine textures [6, 24]; nonetheless, they still influence the perception of coarse surfaces. At the high-frequency range, in which the deformation is smaller than 10 ^- 7  m, because of the limitations of the sensitivity of the force sensor and the noise level of the accelerometer, the accuracy of our method has not been validated; nonetheless, such a small deformation is unlikely to influence the perception of texture as previously mentioned.|$|E
30|$|We did not {{restrain}} the finger joints during the measurement in experiment 3. Hence, the finger could rotate in ab/adduction at the metacarpophalangeal joint. Ideally, such rotation {{should be removed}} throughout the experiments. One may say {{that the effect of}} the finger ab/adduction is minor. According to a study [38] in which the mechanical impedance of the index fingers in abduction was measured, the resonance point of the ab/adduction motion is a few tens of Hertz, above which the rotational vibration is reduced. This also indicates that the whole finger vibration may be magnified at low frequencies and adversely affects the estimation based on the accelerometer at the <b>finger</b> <b>side.</b> Indeed, the finger pad deformations estimated by the accelerometer were greater than those resulting from the shear force at low frequency ranges, as shown in Fig.  10. Bracing the MP joint may lead to the two types of estimates being more congruent.|$|E
50|$|The kortholt is a capped reed instrument. Its {{construction}} {{is similar to}} that of the chanter of a bagpipe. A double reed is mounted inside a chamber.

40|$|We make an {{experimental}} {{characterization of the}} effect that static disorder has on {{the shape of a}} normal Saffman-Taylor finger. We find that static noise induces a small amplitude and long wavelength instability on the <b>sides</b> of the <b>finger.</b> Fluctuations on the <b>finger</b> <b>sides</b> have a dominant wavelength, indicating that the system acts as a selective amplifier of static noise. The dominant wavelength {{does not seem to be}} very sensitive to the intensity of static noise present in the system. On the other hand, at a given flow rate, rms fluctuations of the finger width, decrease with decreasing intensity of static noise. This might explain why the <b>sides</b> of the <b>fingers</b> are flat for typical Saffman-Taylor experiments. Comparison with previous numerical studies of the effect that temporal noise has on the Saffman-Taylor finger, leads to conclude that the effect of temporal noise and static noise are similar. The behavior of fluctuations of the finger width found in our experiments, is qualitatively similar to one recently reported, in the sense that, the magnitude of the width fluctuations decays as a power law of the capillary number, at low flow rates, and increases with capillary number for larger flow rates...|$|R
40|$|Although {{cutaneous}} metastasis occurs {{usually at}} the terminal {{stage of the}} disease, it may be rarely concurrent with the diagnosis and may also present as {{the first sign of}} the illness. A 55 -year-old male patient presented with vasculitic-type cutaneous nodular lesions and a necrotic distal phalangeal lesion developed over the last month.

On physical examination, he was found to have multiple cutaneous lesions on the skin of the face, limbs, neck, scalp, dorsal <b>side,</b> <b>fingers,</b> subungual <b>side,</b> right leg, and feet. A skin lesion punch biopsy was performed and squamous cell carcinoma metastasis was detected. He was diagnosed as having squamous cell lung cancer with bronchoscopic biopsy.
