It’s just {{something}} I’ve had to learn to live with. It affects your playing style; you can’t feel the strings, and there are certain chords I can’t play. Right at the beginning I was told by doctors: “You won’t be playing guitar.” But I believed I could do it, and I did.|$|E

He became an Eagle Scout in Laurinburg's Troop 20 of the Boy Scouts of America (BSA). Shortly before he died, Sanford related his Scouting {{experience}} to journalist David Gergen and said that it [...] "probably saved {{my life in the}} war. Boys who had been Scouts or had been in the CCC knew how to look after themselves in the woods.... What I learned in Scouts sustained me all my life; <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> make decisions about what was best." [...] The BSA recognized him with its Distinguished Eagle Scout Award.|$|E
500|$|Two songs, [...] "Low Down Freedom" [...] and [...] "Black Rose," [...] were {{produced}} by Ronny Light. [...] "We Had It All" [...] {{was produced by}} Jennings and Ken Mansfield. [...] Like the music within, the album cover was also {{at odds with the}} elaborate, often overwrought cover designs from Music Row, featuring an unpretentious shot of a smiling Jennings and his unkempt friends sat around a studio laughing and drinking. [...] In a 2008 interview with Dan MacIntosh, Shaver said of the LP, [...] "Oh, it was great, because the songs were bigger than me. And I couldn't possibly sing as good as Waylon. And at the time, Waylon was just great, so great, and I knew something was gonna happen good for him, and sure enough <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> and it helped him, too, and that's a pretty good trade." ...|$|E

In January 2010, Robinson told a reporter, [...] "When I was getting recruited I always wanted to run track and play football. <b>It</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> move faster on the football field." [...] Michigan track coach Fred LaPlante said Robinson {{had one of the}} 10 fastest 100-meter high-school times in the United States in 2009 and described Robinson the sprinter as [...] "one of the four or five best guys in the Big Ten." [...] LaPlante emphasized Robinson's [...] "quickness":"One thing in football that you don't see in track is quickness. He's incredibly quick and his lateral movement is unbelievable and his ability to go in one direction and get in another. The perception people have is that's speed.

After playing against Lithuania on 28 March 2009, the midfielder went uncapped for the almost {{a year and a}} half. During the 2009–10 season, Nasri grew weary of his chances of appearing with the team at the 2010 FIFA World Cup. In the end, he did not appear with the team, failing to make the 23-man squad or even the preliminary squad. Nasri admitted he took the non-call up hard, recalling, [...] "Not being one of those 23 names, it was difficult." [...] The player also viewed the non-invite from a positive perspective, stating, [...] "But maybe it was for the best in the end, and not just because France had a horrible World Cup. <b>It</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> as a person. I told myself I need to work harder, to make sure I don't miss the next one." ...|$|E

A big challenge there and an enjoyable one really– maybe <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> and the guys in the art department sort of prepare for the end ... we demolished it before we had to strike it completely." [...] When asked about the King's Cross scene {{near the end of the}} film, Craig said, [...] "We experimented a lot, quite honestly. I mean it was quite a protracted process really but we did experiment the sense of it being very burnt out very very kind of white– so we experimented with underlit floors, we experimented with different kind of white covering everything: white paint, white fabric, and the cameraman was involved in how much to expose it, and a series of camera tests were done, so we got there but with a great deal of preparation and research." ...|$|E

500|$|In September 2011, {{less than}} six months after giving birth to twins, Carey tweeted a picture of herself and Jermaine Dupri in a {{recording}} studio working on new material for her currently untitled upcoming fourteenth studio album, with the picture's caption reading [...] "So happy {{to be back in the}} studio with the one & only @Mr_Dupri aka Jermash! We are back together." [...] Following more speculation of the singer's return to the studio, Carey posted photos of herself and Rick Ross in Miami during late April, where the song was produced. Later revealed as the lead single from the singer's upcoming, yet-untitled fourteenth studio album, [...] "Triumphant (Get 'Em)" [...] was written and produced by Carey, Dupri and Bryan-Michael Cox, with Ross and Meek Mill providing their verses. Relaying several hints regarding the song to the media, Carey explained the song's conception in a series of tweets on July 30, 2012: [...] "I wrote Triumphant when I was going through a difficult time and <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> get through it. When u hear it, pay attention to the lyrics." [...] In an interview with MTV, Cox explained what fans would be able to expect from the song and why he felt Ross and Mill were [...] "the perfect fit." [...] He expressed how the [...] "inspirational song" [...] is close to Carey's heart and thought fans would become [...] "emotionally attached" [...] to it. Cox also added that Carey had committed herself to working on the album before she knew she was pregnant, but decided to halt its production until after she had given birth. With regard to the inclusion of the hip-hop duo, he explained how they became involved with the project: ...|$|E

2500|$|In 2001, {{executive}} producer John Yorke decided to reintroduce the character once again. The {{decision was made}} to recast the role to another actress, Kim Medcalf, as Danniella Westbrook was still overcoming her drug problems at this time. During the audition process, EastEnders have said that they had to keep the part they were casting for [...] "top secret", meaning auditionees were not told about the part they were auditioning for until their actual interview. In the documentary, EastEnders Revealed - A Year In The Life Of Sam Mitchell, Medcalf has explained the audition process: [...] "They kind of sat me down and said 'actually we haven't been 100% truthful here, this [...] is not for...a new character at all, it's for the part of Sam Mitchell. Do you know who she is?' and I said, 'yes of course I do!' [...] Because my attitude was so laid back, <b>it</b> <b>helped</b> <b>me</b> a lot." [...] Producer Paul Annett has revealed: [...] "I saw Kim Medcalf along with two other actresses that had been short-listed, and I think almost immediately I knew that she was the right one." [...] Medcalf was an inexperienced actress, and her casting {{has been described as a}} [...] "big risk" [...] because of this. Annett has commented, [...] "she'd done...no television, secondly, she was coming into an immensely popular and beloved show, and the third thing was that she was taking over a role played by Danniella Westbrook...for [...]" [...] Medcalf revealed that she had reservations about taking on a role that was associated with another actress: [...] "I said 'that's going to be hard' [...] but they said 'we think we can do it, we're going to write it in quite cleverly, and part of it will be that we meet Sam away from Walford'." [...] She added, [...] "It was scary finding out I'd be taking over someone else's character because you wonder whether the public will accept it. I loved the show so I just decided to go for it". Commenting on Medcalf's casting, Sam's original actress Danniella Westbrook said, [...] "I wish her all the luck in the world. It's a great part and I'm sure she'll be great." ...|$|E

5000|$|Simpson later {{moved to}} Washington, D.C. in 1988 {{in order to}} {{facilitate}} his quotation collecting and research. Nevertheless, he still remained equally committed to his priestly duties by heading the congregation at the Church of Ascension and Saint Agnes as well as serving the parishes of All Souls Church and St. Paul’s Episcopal Church on K Street and providing ecumenical services as a chaplain for The Georgetown, a retirement residence. In fact, Simpson felt that his work as a priest and his penchant for collecting quotations were symbiotically intertwined in saying that, “It helps make my sermons more interesting. <b>It</b> <b>helps</b> <b>me</b> be aware of trends in medicine and lifestyles. <b>It</b> <b>helps</b> <b>me</b> be involved in the world, so I’m not just a priest.” ...|$|R
