Munch, Bayliss (Kyle Secor) and narcotics detective Russ DeSilva (Steven Marcus) debate whether drugs should be illegal; the homicide detectives claim legalization would reduce violent crime and that drug revenue could go to good causes. Bolander asks Munch if he smokes pot, but he refuses to answer. That night, Munch and Bolander arrest the drug dealer at home.|$|E
5|$|The Viz Media {{releases}} {{preserve the}} Japanese reading order and overlay the visual sound effects with equivalent English text. The English lettering {{was criticized for}} being overly large, which Anime News Network thought made the characters appear to be shouting at inappropriate moments. There are several additional differences between the Japanese and English volume releases of Zombiepowder.. The cover of the second manga volume, which featured an illustration of C.T. Smith <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> to his own head, was replaced in the English edition with new art of Gamma in sunglasses. The English editions of volumes 2-4 also each contain a one-shot story from early in Kubo's career, which were not present in the Japanese collections: Ultra Unholy Hearted Machine, Rune Master Urara, and Bad Shield United, respectively. These extra stories were included for two apparent reasons: to further appeal to Zombiepowder.s primary English-speaking audience of Bleach fans interested {{in the development of}} Tite Kubo's style, and to expand the length of the later volumes, which would otherwise have been shorter than Viz's normal releases, to standard pagecounts.|$|E
5|$|In 1926 Harold Knight {{spent several}} {{months at the}} Johns Hopkins Hospital in Baltimore, in America, {{painting}} portrait commissions of surgeons. Laura joined him there and was given permission to paint at the Baltimore Children's Hospital and in the black wards of the racially segregated Johns Hopkins Hospital. Whilst in Baltimore Knight painted a nurse, Pearl Johnson, who took her to meetings and concerts of the early American civil rights movement. Knight also hired a mother and child model to pose for the composition originally known as the Madonna of the Cotton Fields. Knight took these paintings back to London with her and they feature in the Pathé newsreel produced to mark her election as an Associate of the Royal Academy in 1927. Another portrait of Johnson, Irene and Pearl, shows two women {{against a backdrop of}} skyscrapers and was {{one of a number of}} portraits Knight painted in the late 1920s that appear strikingly modern. Miss Ealand, shown at the Royal Academy in 1928, depicts a woman with cropped hair wearing a jacket and <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> The same year Knight's portrait of a women saxophone player was displayed at the National Gallery of Art in Washington DC.|$|E

25|$|In 1938–40, American painter John Steuart Curry painted Tragic Prelude (left), a {{mural of}} Brown <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun</b> and a Bible, in the Kansas State Capitol in Topeka. In 1941, Jacob Lawrence {{illustrated}} Brown's life in The Legend of John Brown, {{a series of}} 22 gouache paintings. By 1977, these were in such fragile condition {{that they could not}} be displayed, and the Detroit Institute of Arts had to commission Lawrence to recreate the series as silkscreen prints. The result was a limited-edition portfolio of 22 hand-screened prints, published with a poem, John Brown by Robert Hayden, commissioned specifically for the project. Though Brown had been a popular topic for many painters, The Legend of John Brown was the first series to explore his legacy from an African American perspective. Paintings such as Hovenden's The Last Moments of John Brown immortalize an apocryphal story, in which a Black woman offers the condemned Brown her baby to kiss {{on his way to the}} gallows. It was probably a tale invented by journalist James Redpath.|$|E
25|$|Sheriff Masterson got {{his term}} {{off to a}} roaring start on February 1, 1878, by {{capturing}} Dave Rudabaugh and Ed West, who were wanted for an attempted train robbery. Two more of the train robbers were caught by Bat and brother Ed on March 15, but the tandem law-enforcement effort {{came to an abrupt}} end when 25-year-old City Marshal Edward J. Masterson was shot and killed {{in the line of duty}} on April 9, 1878. Ed was shot by a cowboy named Jack Wagner, who was unaware that Ed Masterson's brother Bat was in the vicinity. As mortally wounded Ed stumbled away from the scene, Bat Masterson responded from across the street with deadly force, firing on both Wagner and Wagner's boss Alf Walker, who was <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> Wagner died the next day, but Walker was taken back to Texas and recovered. The local newspapers were ambiguous about who shot Wagner and Walker, and this led some later historians to question whether Bat Masterson was involved. However, the rediscovery of two court cases in which Bat Masterson testified under oath that he had shot both men adds credence to the idea that Bat avenged his brother. More violence followed on October 4, 1878, when a variety actress named Dora Hand, known professionally as Fannie Keenan, was shot and killed by James Kenedy, son of the wealthy Texas cattleman Miflin Kenedy (1818–1895). Sheriff Masterson's posse, which included Wyatt Earp and Bill Tilghman, captured Kenedy the following day after Bat used his rifle to shoot him in the left arm, and other posse members killed his horse.|$|E

Nikolas is not home at the time, and as she searches through his desk to find a paper to leave a note, she is stopped by Mr. Craig (Sebastian Roche), the head gunman from the Metro Court hostage crisis, and finds out he is blackmailing Nikolas for a new identity. When Nikolas returns home, he finds Robin tending to Craig's wound and finds out that Craig had decided Robin might be useful in his blackmail plot. Craig instructs Robin to go about her normal life and not {{to draw attention to}} herself. Also, she cannot not tell anybody—especially Patrick—and he makes numerous threats against Patrick to keep her in line. Robin goes about his instructions and gets into a fight with Patrick. On March 29, 2007, Patrick goes over to Wyndemere and demands that Nikolas tell him what is going on. Nikolas hesitates and Robin walks in. She can see Craig {{out of the corner of}} her eye, <b>holding</b> <b>a</b> <b>gun.</b> She fears for Patrick's safety, so she lies to him and tells him they are over. Later, Craig decides that a good cover story for Robin living at Wyndemere will be to have Robin and Nikolas play out a very public love affair. They agreed, fearing for their loved ones' lives. At the end of the day, Alexis (Nancy Lee Grahn) walks into Wyndemere, stopping dead in her tracks when she sees Robin and Nikolas in a very delicate position on the couch. The two brush it off as though it is nothing, but Alexis is clearly suspicious. Robin and Patrick are reunited following an almost deadly confrontation with Mr Craig.
