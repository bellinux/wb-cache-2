Given that the ensemble of biomarkers in OC includes more than 50 molecules the interest of the researchers focuses on the possible validation of each one’s potential as prognosis markers and/or therapeutic targets. Within this framework, this review presents three protein molecules: ALCAM, c-FLIP, and caveolin, motivated by the perspectives provided through the current limited knowledge on their role in ovarian carcinogenesis and on their potential as prognosis factors. Their structural stability, once altered, triggers the initiation of the sequences characteristic for ovarian carcinogenesis, through their role as modulators for several signaling pathways, contributing to the disruption of cellular junctions, disturbance of pro-/antiapoptotic equilibrium, and alteration of transmission of the signals specific for the molecular pathways.

Although many new re-sults are included, the following is more in the nature of a general re-view of the subject, and thus includes many things discussed at previous conferences. l- 3 See the’review of Rollnick for a discussion of the low energy results. Work supported by the U. S, Atomic Energy Commission. <b>I.</b> <b>GENERAL</b> <b>REMARKS</b> Photoproduction is traditionally lumped into “Electromagnetic Interactions, I’ primarily because the experiments are done at electron machines. These re-. actions tell us very little about electromagnetism, however, because the theory of quantum electrodynamics (QED) appears to work as well as the initials imply, Rather, the theoretical uncertainty in the photoproduction of hadrons lies with the word %adrons, VT andin fact,the theoretical interest in these reactions is mainly the same as for reactions studied at proton machines. Among the models used to interpret photoproduction at high energies are diffraction, elementary one-pion exchange with and without absorption, coherent droplet, Regge poles, Regge cuts, and dispersion relations such as continuous moment sum rules. At low energies, as for hadronic induced reactions, phase-shift analyses ’ have been useful and, in fact, some of the early photoproduction work was instrumental in the analysis of low-lying N”‘s. l%oton beams can be compared with pion beams; both ‘yp and np have s-channel quantum numbers of an N*: S = 0, B =l.

A simple but predictive ansatz is proposed to simultaneously interpret the observed baryon asymmetry {{of the universe and}} oscillations of solar and atmospheric neutrinos. The density of baryons compared to that of photons in the universe is extremely small: η ≡ n B /n γ = (2. 6 − 6. 3) × 10 − 10, extracted from the Big-Bang nucleosynthesis [1]. This tiny quantity is related to the observed matter-antimatter or baryon-antibaryon asymmetry of the universe, YB ≡ nB s ≈ η 7. 04 = (3. 7 − 8. 9) × 10 − 11, (1) where s denotes the entropy density.

40|$|In {{this paper}} I explore the {{prospects}} of applying inference to the Best Explanation (TIBE – sometimes also known as ‘abduction’) to {{an account of the}} way we decide whether to accept the word of others (sometimes known as ‘aliens’). IBE is a general account of nondemonstrative or inductive inference, but it has been applied in a particular way to the management of testimony. The governing idea of Testimonial IBE (TIBE) is that a recipient of testimony (‘hearer’) decides whether to believe the claim of the informant (‘speaker’) by considering whether the truth of that claim would figure in the best explanation {{of the fact that the}} speaker made it. I begin by introducing the general idea of IBE as an account of many nondemonstrative inferences. Then <b>I</b> make some <b>general</b> <b>remarks</b> about the epistemology of testimony, and especially about the problem of accounting for the way we decide whether to believe what we are told. Third, I suggest how IBE could used to account for this process of testimonial discrimination, the idea of TIBE. In the final two sections I consider the obvious objection to TIBE: it is either trivial or false. Inference to the Best Explanation in genera...|$|R
40|$|Research at the forefront, new {{fields for}} research, the cutting edge? Given this rather ambitious and {{possibly}} grandiose brief, I began by asking around among my colleagues for their views, I kept my ears {{open at the}} recent ICA in San Francisco, so as to listen out for the new ideas in the air before they reached the always-delayed publication stage, and I scanned recent issues {{of the media and}} communication journals. But while the ICA was full of interesting ideas and people, I did not detect any major new orientations. Similarly, my colleagues looked rather blank when asked for the cutting edge in media research. And the journals are, by and large, publishing the same kinds of articles on the same kinds of subjects as they always do. In this brief paper, <b>I</b> offer some <b>general</b> <b>remarks</b> about the state of media and communications research, using audience research as my example. These remarks focus on the disciplinary status and ambitions of media and communications research, and are certainly not intended as any kind of attack media and communications research or researchers: there is a huge amount of interesting, valuable, productive and thoughtprovoking research going on across many fronts, though in the main, I see it as contributin...|$|R
