50|$|Qualifying {{status is}} {{determined}} {{at the outset}} of the policy if the contract meets certain criteria. Essentially, long term contracts (10 years plus) tend to be qualifying policies and the proceeds are free from income tax and capital gains tax. Single premium contracts and those running for a short term are subject to income tax depending upon the marginal rate in the year a gain is made. All UK insurers pay a special rate of corporation tax on the profits from their life book; this is deemed as meeting the lower rate (20% in 2005-06) of liability for policyholders. Therefore, a policyholder who is a higher rate taxpayer (40% in 2005-06), or becomes one through the transaction, must pay tax on the gain at the difference between the higher and the lower rate. This gain is reduced by applying a calculation called top-slicing based on the number of years the policy has been held. Although this is complicated, the taxation of life assurance-based investment contracts may be beneficial compared to alternative equity-based collective investment schemes (unit trusts, investment trusts and OEICs). One feature which especially favors investment bonds is the '5% cumulative allowance' - the ability to draw 5% of the original investment amount each policy year without being subject to any taxation on the amount withdrawn. If not used in one year, the 5% allowance can roll over into future years, subject to a maximum tax-deferred withdrawal of 100% of the premiums payable. The withdrawal is deemed by the HMRC (Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs) to be a payment of capital and therefore, the tax liability is deferred until maturity or surrender of the policy. This is an especially useful tax planning tool for higher rate taxpayers who expect to become basic rate taxpayers at some predictable point in the future, as at this point the <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> will not result in tax being due.|$|E

40|$|This study {{deals with}} the {{historical}} development and the current situation {{of the relationship between}} taxation and accounting in Finland. The emphasis is on the major changes in accounting and tax regulation. Financial accounting and taxation in Finland have been based on 'expenditure-revenue' accounting theory. In fact, the Company Income Tax Law (1968) institutionalized the usage of this accounting theory. Taxation has been linked strictly to book-keeping in formal and material terms in Finland. Extensive income smoothing due to the flexible depreciation and inventory undervaluation practices has characterized Finnish accounting until the beginning of the 1990 s. The concept of deferred taxation has not been the central issue in Finnish accounting and there is no detailed regulation regarding accounting for it. Since the 1992 amendements, it has been allowed in group accounts to divide depreciation difference between tax and financial accounts and untaxed reserves into equity and <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> in balance sheets. To conclude, there has been very interesting interplay between the harmonization efforts, needs for international comparability, remaining tax dependence and the role of accounting theory in Finland. ...|$|E

40|$|This article {{examines}} the theory underlying the current accounting and reporting standards for deferred taxes and concludes that using the flow-through accounting approach is a better fit for reporting this financial statement item than the asset-liability approach currently required by the Financial Accounting Standards Board (FASB). The authors propose that the underlying issue in accounting for deferred taxes is the unit problem as presented by Carl Devine. To obtain a perspective on the magnitude and behavior of the deferred tax account balances reported by firms, 2, 100 firms in 20 industries were observed approximately over a ten-year period (1997 - 2006). Most firms appear to postpone deferred tax reversals by utilizing tax planning strategies, allowing them to defer indefinitely the requirement to pay tax on earlier timing differences. Therefore, net <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> balances {{can be thought of}} as possible or remote contingencies rather than probable liabilities. To illustrate the financial consequences of using the approach where the tax expense is equal to the statutory tax liability instead of the expense reported under the current rules, the change in the debt-to-equity (DTE) ratios was computed for the firms in the sample by eliminating the net deferred tax balances from liabilities and adding them to equities...|$|E

40|$|This study {{analyses}} the {{deferred tax}} provisions of firms {{during a period}} in which the firms' incentive to manage earnings may have been be particularly strong and in which firms made disclosures in relation to partial deferred tax provisions which revealed readily their under- or over-provision of deferred tax. Using a sample of 58 firms for the two years 1991 and 1992, the magnitude of the under- or over-provisions found is economically significant, amounting, on average, to around 20 % of the maximum potential <b>deferred</b> <b>tax</b> <b>liability</b> and, more important, 9 % of profit or loss before tax. This paper takes such under- and over-provision of deferred tax and investigates its relationship with a number of posited explanatory variables - as derived and developed from the earnings management literature. In a multivariate setting it is found that the level of under-/over-provision is related to the following characteristics: whether the firm is reporting a pre-tax loss or a pre-tax profit; the extent of adjustment to prior year tax; and the level of surplus advance corporation tax (ACT). These findings support a general profit- smoothing hypothesis, and the finding in relation to ACT suggests that firms take an overall view in determining the required level of provision in order to manage earnings, rather than concentrating upon particular line items. There is also weaker evidence of a relationship between the level of under-/over-provision and firms' levels of gearing and effective tax rates...|$|E
