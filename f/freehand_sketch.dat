The input sketch is a natural line drawing with hidden line removed that depicts a 3 D object in real world. The system is configured to interpret sketch under isometric view, {{which is the most}} popular viewpoint among designers. The system automatically tidies-up the freehand 2 D sketch and reconstructs it into a 3 D object. The object can then be transformed, which provides immediate feedback to the designers. New sketch can be drawn over the 3 D object, and then be reconstructed into 3 D by referring to the existing 3 D object from the current viewpoint. This method allows the designers add new parts on the ``backside' ' of the initial sketch. The incremental modelling from sketch enables easy reconstruction of complex 3 D objects comparing with the current 3 D reconstruction algorithms.

The importance of the <b>freehand</b> <b>sketch</b> is {{in its ability to}} freely represent various drawing projections using ambiguous sketches. However, as far as the various drawing projections, such as diagram, symbol, plan, elevation, section, perspective, etc., how are they interrelated to a designer’s thinking process and the cognitive behavior? Although both pen-based system and pen-and-paper use pen as a design media, however different media have different abilities to represent different projections, would they affect the designer’s design thinking as well? Targeting different media, i. e. conventional pen-and-paper vs. computer pen-based system, this research uses case studies and think-aloud protocol analysis to present an analysis and discussion. Research results show that there is a relationship of gradual embodiment, mutually complementary, going from a whole perspective to being dissected into section between the different projections.

40|$|Graduation date: 1991 A {{system which}} allows the {{computer}} to capture sketches made by a mechanical designer is described. The system not only recognizes basic features as they are sketched, but it also reasons the spatial relationships between features and builds a high level abstract representation (feature model) of the artifact. The temporal nature of the capture, one feature at a time, serves to form a feature graph that allows for parametric design. The system is composed of three subsystems: a two-dimensional <b>freehand</b> <b>sketching</b> subsystem¹, a three-dimensional features recognition subsystem, and a spatial reasoning subsystem. The <b>freehand</b> <b>sketching</b> subsystem takes the user's input sketching actions and interprets them as simple, two-dimensional geometric elements, such as line segments, circles, and ellipses, etc. The features recognition subsystem interprets the collection of two-dimensional geometric elements to extract three-dimensional information from them and creates high level abstract representations, features. The spatial reasoning subsystem finds relationships between a new feature and existing features and integrates features to form a single part. The work of the Design Capture System is aimed at capturing sketches of a specific application domain: injected molding plastic parts. Twenty injected molding plastic parts were collected and analyzed to understand the distribution of features. Isometric sketching is selected as the basic constructing method for the system.
