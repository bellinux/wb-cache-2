5|$|In August 2015, Samaras was {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> terms with Serie A club Sampdoria, but the move fell through as the club were unhappy {{with the results of}} his medical. Afterwards, he spent time in New York to rehabilitate from a back injury, and in November 2015 was linked with a move to the New York Cosmos, although once again no move actually materialised.|$|E
5|$|In Digitopolis, {{they meet}} the Mathemagician, {{who is still}} angry at Azaz, and who will not give his blessing to {{anything}} that his brother has approved. Milo maneuvers him into saying he will permit the quest if the boy can show the two have concurred on anything since they banished the princesses. To the number wizard's shock, Milo proves that the two <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to disagree, and the Mathemagician gives his reluctant consent.|$|E
5|$|In June 2014 he was {{reported}} to <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> terms with South African side Bidvest Wits of the Premier Soccer League, but the move was never completed. He had a trial with Cheltenham Town in March 2015, and impressed in a reserve game against Plymouth Argyle after being out injured for the season, but the club was unable to offer him a contract.|$|E

5|$|In the mid-1980s, after Smith's death, {{a script}} {{was written for}} a {{television}} movie titled The Samantha Smith Story with Robert Wagner as producer. Columbia Pictures Television and R.J. Wagner Productions were reported to <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to produce the film for NBC, with Soviet company Sovin Film interested in co-producing it. Ultimately, Columbia Pictures Television decided not to film it {{due to lack of}} interest from any network.|$|E
5|$|Morphological and {{allozyme}} analyses <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> {{that the}} common thresher is basal to the clade formed by the bigeye thresher and the pelagic thresher (A. pelagicus). The closest relative of this species within the family may be a fourth, unrecognized thresher shark species off Baja California, reported from allozyme evidence by Blaise Eitner in 1995. However, {{the existence of this}} fourth species has yet to be confirmed by other sources.|$|E
5|$|To Ann's surprise, Chris (Rob Lowe) {{has also}} been {{admitted}} to the hospital with the flu. The two have been dating and, although Ann really likes Chris, she fears he is too perfect. However, because the extremely health-conscious Chris has a poor immune system and nearly no body fat, he suffers a complete physical breakdown, which makes Ann feel less intimidated about dating him. Meanwhile, Leslie escapes the hospital and heads back to city hall to deliver the presentation herself. Tom returns from the spa, revealing his spa friends are the owners of several car dealerships, which <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to lend vehicles to the festival. Although delirious with fever and an excess of flu medication, Leslie delivers a flawless presentation, wildly impressing Ben. She is immediately brought back to the hospital, where Ben tells her 110 businesses <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to help with the festival, surpassing the minimum 80 needed.|$|E

5|$|In 821, {{the year}} of Coenwulf's death, a council was held in London at which Coenwulf {{threatened}} to exile Wulfred if the archbishop did not surrender an estate of 300 hides and make a payment of 120 pounds to the king. Wulfred is recorded to <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to these terms, but the conflict continued well past Coenwulf's death, with an apparently final agreement between Wulfred and Coenwulf's daughter Cwoenthryth reached in 826 or 827. However, Wulfred officiated at the consecration of Coenwulf's brother and heir, Ceolwulf, on 17 September 822, so {{it is evident that}} some accommodation had been reached by that time. Wulfred had probably resumed his archiepiscopal duties earlier that year.|$|E
5|$|In October 2011 {{city and}} state {{officials}} announced an agreement in which the UN {{would be allowed to}} build a long-sought new office tower adjacent to the existing campus on the current Robert Moses Playground, which would be relocated. In exchange, the United Nations would allow the construction of an esplanade along the East River that would complete the East River Greenway, a waterfront pedestrian and bicycle pathway. While host nation authorities <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to the provisions of the plan, it needs the approval of the United Nations in order to be implemented. The plan is similar in concept to an earlier proposal that had been announced in 2000 but did not move forward.|$|E
5|$|In the A-not-B task, {{children}} are shown an object hidden at Location A within their reach, and are then prompted {{to search for}} the object at Location A, where they find it. This activity is repeated several times, with the hidden object at Location A. Then, in the critical trial, the object is hidden in Location B, a second location within easy reach of child. Typically, children younger than one year old search for the object under Location A, where the object was previously hidden. However, after their first birthday, {{children are}} capable of mentally switching to locate the object in Location B, demonstrating flexibility. Researchers <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> that the A-not-B task is a simple task that effectively measures cognitive flexibility during infancy.|$|E

5|$|In the {{practice}} nets, the county players towered over Larwood; the veteran Test batsman George Gunn {{thought he looked}} more like a jockey than a cricketer. At first he bowled badly, and his efforts were unimpressive. As his confidence increased his bowling improved, and committee members began to revise their initial dismissive judgement; when the session ended, Larwood was offered a playing contract. He accepted instantly; the terms were 32 shillings (£1.60) per week—the same as his mining wages—and he was expected, when not playing, to carry out ground staff duties. Robert Larwood was angry that his son had not asked for more generous terms, but according to Hamilton, Harold would <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to anything to escape from the mine, even for a single summer.|$|E
5|$|The Enterprise {{arrives at}} Ornara, and Sobi and Langor <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> {{to provide the}} Felicium to the Ornarans for later payment. However, Picard announces that as the Prime Directive {{prevents}} him from interfering in the transactions between the two planets, it also prevents him from providing any replacement parts for the aging freighters. T'Jon and Romas are furious at the decision as {{it means that the}} trade between Ornara and Brekka will stop because the freighters can no longer make the trips without the parts. After the four are transported off the Enterprise, Picard confides to Dr. Crusher that while the Ornarans may suffer from withdrawal symptoms in the short term, this will be an opportunity for both races to advance in their own ways.|$|E
5|$|The Five Power Defence Arrangements is a {{regional}} security initiative {{which has been}} in place for almost 40 years. It involves joint military exercises held among Malaysia, Singapore, Australia, New Zealand, and the United Kingdom. Joint exercises and war games also been held with Brunei, China, Indonesia and the United States. Malaysia, Philippines, Thailand and Vietnam <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to host joint security force exercises to secure their maritime border and tackle issues such as illegal immigration, piracy and smuggling. Previously there are fears that extremist militants activities in the Muslim areas of the southern Philippines and southern Thailand would spill over into Malaysia. Due to this, Malaysia began to increase its border security.|$|E

5|$|The {{debate about}} whether Tyrannosaurus was a {{predator}} or a pure scavenger {{is as old as}} the debate about its locomotion. Lambe (1917) described a good skeleton of Tyrannosaurus’ close relative Gorgosaurus and concluded that it and therefore also Tyrannosaurus was a pure scavenger, because the Gorgosaurus’ teeth showed hardly any wear. This argument is no longer taken seriously, because theropods replaced their teeth quite rapidly. Ever since the first discovery of Tyrannosaurus most scientists <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> that it was a predator, although like modern large predators it would have been happy to scavenge or steal another predator's kill if it had the opportunity.|$|E
5|$|The former Prime Minister Dr. Manmohan Singh {{announced}} the operationalisation of the Act. Children, who had either {{dropped out of}} schools or never been to any educational institution, will get elementary education as it will be binding {{on the part of}} the local and State governments to ensure that all children in the 6–14 age group get schooling. As per the Act, private educational institutions should reserve 25 per cent seats for children from the weaker sections of society. The Centre and the States <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to share the financial burden in the ratio of 55:45, while the Finance Commission has given Rs.250billion to the States for implementing the Act. The Centre has approved an outlay of Rs.150billion for 2010–2011.|$|E
5|$|Australia {{returned}} to Sydney in November 1921, and was paid off into reserve in December. By this time battlecruisers built before the Battle of Jutland were considered obsolete, {{and there is}} no record of the Admiralty suggesting that Australia purchase a replacement. Moreover, {{it is unlikely that the}} Australian Government would <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to such a suggestion given the prevailing political and financial conditions. As the Admiralty had decided to phase out 12-inch guns and had stopped the manufacture of shells for these weapons shortly after the war, it would have been necessary to replace Australias main armament once the Navy's stock of shells reached their expiry date given that it was not possible to produce replacement shells in Australia. This was also not financially feasible for the government, particularly given the RAN's lack of interest in retaining the ship.|$|E

5|$|Croatia and Hungary <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to the Cultural Cooperation Programme, which defines {{cooperation}} and cultural exchange {{in the fields}} of music, theatre and dance, and with respect to the arts, museums, galleries, literature, publishing, libraries, archives, film and cultural-heritage protection. The programme was agreed to on 7 November 2011 in Budapest by secretaries of the Croatian Ministry of Culture and the Hungarian Ministry of National Resources. The programme pertains to the 20122014 period and represents a continuation of cultural cooperation through cultural exchange, outside the framework of formal agreements. Cultural, educational and scientific cooperation between the two countries is covered by a treaty of 16 March 1994, with additional treaties regulating diploma recognitions since 16 June 1997 and additional treaties and protocols on scientific and technological cooperation signed in 2002 and 2009. The scientific and educational cooperation entails the awarding of scholarships and bilateral research projects.|$|E
5|$|In November 1167 Foliot {{was summoned}} to Normandy, then ruled by Henry II, to meet with papal legates and the king. Roger of York, Hilary of Chichester, and Roger of Worcester were also summoned to attend. After some {{discussion}} and argument, Henry appears to <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> that the legates could judge both the king's case against Becket {{as well as the}} bishops' case. Henry also offered a compromise {{on the subject of the}} Constitutions of Clarendon, that the legates accepted. However, when the legates met with Becket on 18November, it quickly became apparent that Becket would not accept negotiations with the king nor accept the legates as judges of either case against him. As the legates had no mandate to compel Becket to accept them as judges, the negotiations came to an end with the king and bishops still appealing to the papacy.|$|E
5|$|Jim Halpert (John Krasinski) asks Dunder Mifflin CEO David Wallace (Andy Buckley) if he {{can work}} {{part-time}} so he can go to Philadelphia to help with his sports marketing job. David Wallace says {{that he might be}} needed in the office if there is a crisis with one of his clients, to which he responds that Stanley Hudson (Leslie David Baker) and Phyllis Vance (Phyllis Smith) <b>have</b> <b>agreed</b> to cover for him, though he in fact has not asked them yet. Stanley and Phyllis respond with their usual disinterest in helping others, so Jim offers to treat them to lunch. Stanley and Phyllis order extra side dishes and help themselves to an excess of wine, annoying Jim with drunken behavior and silencing him whenever he brings up the subject of their covering for him. When they arrive back at the office, a drunk Stanley and Phyllis are seemingly passed out in the backseat of Jim's car. When Jim puts his coat on them to keep them warm, Phyllis and Stanley say they will cover for him as they care for Jim and his family, laughing as they reveal they were only pranking him. Jim gives both of them a hug.|$|E
