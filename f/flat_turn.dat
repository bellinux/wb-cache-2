5000|$|Jack Rabbit : A wooden {{roller coaster}} opened in 1920 {{designed}} by John A. Miller and built by Harry C. Baker. The ride {{consists of an}} initial 7 story drop, then two hills, a <b>flat</b> <b>turn,</b> another two hills, another <b>flat</b> <b>turn</b> and lastly a dip inside a dark tunnel before hitting the brakes.|$|E
50|$|The circuit also {{features}} an oval layout {{due to the}} inclusion of a <b>flat</b> <b>turn</b> that goes {{from the middle of the}} main straight to the beginning of the back stretch of circuit. Unlike the road course, the oval is raced in counter-clockwise direction (except for the Formula E race).|$|E

Hindquarters should be lengthy and strong, with a well set on tail. Hind legs - second thigh should {{be strong and}} muscular. Hocks clean and <b>flat,</b> <b>turning</b> neither inwards nor outwards. The hind leg must not be too bent. Feet: well shaped and dense.|$|R
50|$|In 2001 Susan George {{was cast}} as Margaret Walker, a new love {{interest}} for Terry. Although sources prior to filming suggested that Margaret {{would be a}} sophisticated conwoman, this was never actually confirmed on-screen. The ending of the storyline was left ambiguous, as although the man at Margaret's <b>flat</b> <b>turns</b> out to be her brother after all, he {{does not appear to}} be dying, as Margaret had said.|$|R

50|$|The vacuum tube-based {{guidance}} system is {{more sophisticated than}} earlier torpedoes, using pre-launch settings enabling an initial search depth of 50, 150, 250, 450, 650 or 900 feet {{as well as a}} search floor at 150, 250, 450, 650 or 900 feet as well as a maximum dive/climb angle of 4.5, 6 or 7 degrees. On impacting the water the torpedo either runs out for 1,000 yards or performs a dive at a 30-degree angle to the search depth. After completing this it may perform a <b>flat</b> <b>turn</b> and begins a helical search pattern proceeding up or down until it hits either the minimum depth of 50 yards or the search floor. When it hits either top or bottom, it performs a <b>flat</b> <b>turn</b> and begins to execute the search in reverse. It continues executing this search until it either finds a target or exhausts its six-minute endurance.|$|E
50|$|Riders are hoisted up a 83 ft lift {{hill and}} make a wide turn before {{reaching}} the initial drop. During the drop, an on-ride camera automatically takes photographs of passengers. The ride continues with a wide, heavily banked, <b>flat</b> <b>turn,</b> then a series of hills and drops which jerk and shake passengers, giving the coaster a reputation of being bumpy and rickety.|$|E
5000|$|Greyhound : A wooden side-friction design wooden roller coaster. Opened in 1916 as [...] "Dips", but renamed for {{no known}} reason in 1926 to Greyhound. The ride {{consisted}} of several drops that were {{about a few}} feet tall and some <b>flat</b> <b>turns</b> (think {{of it as a}} really old version of the currently operating Bobsleds). The old loading station for Greyhound is still on site, but reused as the building for the Bumper Cars.|$|R
5000|$|Besides {{patenting}} ingenious inventions for coasters—including {{several types}} of brakes and car bar locks—Miller built his share of unusual [...] "scream machines." [...] In 1920 Miller went into business with Harry C. Baker as [...] "Miller & Baker, Inc." [...] {{and over the next}} three years, they built popular coasters all over North America. Characteristics of their roller coasters are camelback hills (multiple straight or slightly angled drops that {{went all the way to}} the ground) and large, <b>flat</b> <b>turns.</b>|$|R
40|$|A {{modified}} YF- 16 {{aircraft was}} used to flight demonstrate decoupled modes under the USAF Fighter Control Configured Vehicle (CCV) Program. The direct force capabilities were used to implement seven manually controlled unconventional modes on the aircraft, allowing <b>flat</b> <b>turns,</b> decoupled normal acceleration control, independent longitudinal and lateral translations, uncoupled elevation and azimuth aiming, and blended direct lift. This paper describes the design, development, and flight testing of these control modes. The need for task-tailored mode authorities, gain-scheduling and selected closed-loop design is discussed...|$|R
5000|$|Reception to {{the movie}} has been negative, with Fearnet's Scott Weinberg saying [...] "while it's by no means awful, the movie's as {{effortlessly}} forgettable as its title." [...] Reelfilm's David Nusair stated that [...] "Though it kicks off with a relatively promising prologue, Beneath's few positive elements are ultimately rendered moot by an almost impossibly slow-moving narrative that's exacerbated by Nora Zehetner's woefully <b>flat</b> <b>turn</b> as the central character." ...|$|E
5000|$|Whirlwind : A steel {{spinning}} {{roller coaster}} designed and manufactured by German company Maurer Sohne (Whirlwind is an Xtended SC 2000 model).The ride initially operated as [...] "Cyber Space" [...] from 2000 to 2003 on the Spanish fair circuit with Family Fraguas before Seabreeze purchased the ride. The Whirlwind replaced the former Quantum Loop roller coaster, opening in 2004. The ride experience {{starts with a}} 5 story swooping drop before curving back up. Then the car whips around a <b>flat</b> <b>turn</b> (this turn is where the spinning actually initiates).The rest of the ride consists of an 85 degree banked turn followed by other turns and helixes.|$|E
40|$|The {{results of}} the space shuttle {{automatic}} landing support program studies performed from November 1, 1975 to March 31, 1976 were summarized. The following subjects were discussed: (1) software definition review (TAEM pre-final and Autoland only), (2) software definition review (KPIT scheduling), (3) deletion of air data, (4) June 1975 aero data update and check runs, (5) <b>flat</b> <b>turn</b> study, (6) guidance mode switching study, (7) <b>flat</b> <b>turn</b> study-additional data, (8) trajectory shaping study, (9) aero data tolerances, and (10) turbulence model study...|$|E
50|$|Arbor: Similar to the prong in {{the middle}} of a record player, onto which the record is placed. The lap, or {{grinding}} wheel, is placed onto it rather than a record, and the arbor is machined to run perfectly <b>flat</b> when <b>turning.</b>|$|R
50|$|The coaxial rotor design {{provides}} a hovering ceiling of 4,000 m and vertical {{rate of climb}} of 10 m a second {{at an altitude of}} 2,500 m. The rotor blades are made from polymer materials. The coaxial-rotor configuration results in moments of inertia values relative to vertical and lateral axes between 1.5 and two times less than the values found in single-rotor helicopters with tail rotors. Absence of the tail rotor enables the helicopter to perform <b>flat</b> <b>turns</b> within the entire flight speed range. A maximum vertical load factor of 3.5 g combined with low moments of inertia give the Ka-50 a high level of agility. Flight systems include inertial navigation system (INS), autopilot and head-up display (HUD). Sensors include forward-looking infrared (FLIR) and terrain-following radar.|$|R

40|$|A {{priority}} of physics instruction {{is to help}} students make {{the connection between the}} formulae they think they are required to memorize and the real world in which they interact every day. If you ask students to describe a situation in real life involving physical principles, the most commonly cited examples will pertain to vehicular motion. One situation in real life involving physical principles is vehicle dynamics. Even students who have little interest in physics eagerly discuss problems like how much a car can decelerate travelling in a <b>flat</b> <b>turn</b> or how tricks like the Wheely can be performed on a motorcycle. In the physics classroom, the motion of automotive vehicles is probably the most interesting manifestation of the principles of physics. The laws of physics limiting movements of vehicles are deduced here in a simple derivation suited for classroom demonstration as well as for homework. Due to limits on frictional forces there are subsequent limits for acceleration, deceleration and speed in a <b>flat</b> <b>turn.</b> Frictional forces also determine the behaviour of a vehicle at rapid speed in a turn.

40|$|FASER Flight 1 : pitch/roll doublets. Takeoff went well, initial flying under {{manual control}} for pilot familiarization and trimming. Investigated various landing {{configuration}} schemes (full wing flaps, inner flaps only, clean). Several stalls were performed, benign pitch break with slight left roll. Engaged the controller twice. Throttle setting {{seemed a bit}} low. Rudder trim setting was way off, resulting in a sustained 5 deg sideslip <b>flat</b> <b>turn.</b> Roll/pitch doublets went fine. Landing was challenging due to the small runway and the folding prop {{makes it hard to}} slow the aircraft down...|$|E
50|$|The {{speedway}} {{was built}} as a one-mile oval with <b>flat</b> <b>turns.</b> North Carolina Motor Speedway opened on October 31, 1965, holding its first race on the same day. The American 500 was a 500-lap, 500-mile NASCAR Grand National Series race won by Curtis Turner at an average speed of 101.942 miles per hour. Turner dominated the race, which was attended by 35,000 people, leading 239 laps and winning by 11 seconds. The winner's purse was $13,090 ($88,434.05 adjusted for inflation). The American 500 was the 54th of 55 races in the 1965 season, which included NASCAR legends Cale Yarborough (who finished second), Richard Petty, Ned Jarrett (who {{would go on to}} win the championship), Buddy Baker, David Pearson, and Junior Johnson. Only 19 of the 43 cars were running {{at the end of the}} race.|$|R
5000|$|Children {{found the}} {{moveable}} books entertaining and were induced {{to play with}} the clever mechanisms, [...] Various innovative types of mechanisms were designed in Dean's workshops. [...] "Peep show" [...] style consisted of cutting out sections of illustrated scenes, stacking and then folding <b>flat.</b> <b>Turning</b> the page caused the attaching ribbon be pulled and a three-dimensional scene popped up. [...] "Living pictures" [...] were animated by pulling a tab to move or [...] "animate" [...] different parts of the scene on the page. [...] "Pantomime books" [...] were made with pages of varying sizes; turning a page caused the scene to change. These were released in the [...] "Home Pantomime Toy Book" [...] series that included sumptuously coloured and illustrated chromolithographs, and became popular editions, such as their printing of [...] "Beauty and the Beast".|$|R

50|$|The Hulme Homes for Change {{redevelopment}} {{is one of}} {{the most}} important projects in the UK, providing a real life model of the SUN. URBED worked to regenerate Hulme, a 1960s deck-access housing estate and thirteen tower blocks that was suffering physical and social decline. Once a vibrant working class area, the reputation of the area had fallen significantly, with poverty, crime, drug use and unemployment on the rise. However, the proximity of the area to the University and easy availability of flats meant it attracted more and more young people to become a focus for Manchester’s subculture. Single squatters took over family <b>flats,</b> <b>turning</b> the bedrooms into offices, workshops and recording studios. The area had one of the highest levels of higher education qualifications in the city by the late 1980s, yet also a large number of unqualified and unemployed. This diverse community fought hard to prevent the redevelopment of the area in the 1980s.|$|R

50|$|The track {{reflects}} the art deco district of nearby Miami Beach with its liberal use of colors such as aqua, purple and silver. Though the track {{itself has been}} considered to be aesthetically pleasing from the outset, initially the racing at Homestead was not considered very good. The track opened as a four-turn, rectangular-oval, based on the Indianapolis Motor Speedway's layout, coincidental considering that circuit and Miami Beach were developed by Carl G. Fisher. However, due to its shorter distance, the track {{was not able to}} maintain the racing characteristics of the Indianapolis Motor Speedway. Instead, the sharp, <b>flat</b> <b>turns</b> and aprons made passing difficult and lowered overall speed. The geometry also created unfavorably severe crash angles. In 1996, track management attempted to correct the problems by widening the aprons of the turns by as much as 24 ft. The movie Super Speedway was shot at the speedway before the track was reconfigured to an oval. In the summer of 1997, an $8.2 million reconfiguration project changed the turns from a rectangle to a traditional, continuous turn oval.|$|R
50|$|Even in <b>flat</b> spacetime, it <b>turns</b> {{out that}} {{accelerating}} observers (even linearly accelerating observers; see Rindler coordinates) can employ various distinct but operationally significant notions of distance. Perhaps {{the simplest of}} these is radar distance.|$|R

The learned among them confess the absurdity of this doctrine; but the practice still continues, in compliance to the vulgar.|$|R
5000|$|A Wild Mouse {{roller coaster}} (also Mad Mouse or Crazy Mouse) {{is a type}} of roller coaster characterised by small cars that seat four people or fewer and ride on top of the track, taking tight, <b>flat</b> <b>turns</b> (without banking) at modest speeds, yet {{producing}} high lateral G-forces. The track work is characterised by many turns and bunny hops, the latter producing abrupt negative vertical G forces. When approaching a turn from a straight section the intended impression is that one will simply continue straight, and thus plunge off of the device, this since there are no transition sections as are in a conventional high speed coaster track and the turn itself is obscured upon close approach. Almost all Wild Mice feature [...] "switchback" [...] sections, consisting of several of these unbanked turns, separated by straight sections. Usually the turns on the switchback section are 180°, but some coasters feature 90° turns as well as more rarely steep runs with loops (for example Crazy Mouse at Tobu Zoo in Japan, which is no longer operating). Some riders, usually among taller people, report sustaining whiplash after being subjected to these turns.|$|R

The material dredged from the river would be used to build up the <b>flats</b> and <b>turn</b> them into dry land, eliminating the public health dangers they caused.|$|R
