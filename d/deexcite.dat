40|$|We are {{developing}} a novel code that treats induced fission by statistical (or Monte-Carlo) simulation of individual decay chains. After its initial excitation, the fissionable compound nucleus may either <b>deexcite</b> by evaporation or undergo binary fission into {{a large number of}} fission channels each with different energetics involving both energy dissipation and deformed scission prefragments. After separation and Coulomb acceleration, each fission fragment undergoes a succession of individual (neutron) evaporations, leading to two bound but still excited fission products (that may further decay electromagnetically and, ultimately, weakly), as well as typically several neutrons.

40|$|The {{internal}} {{temperatures of}} fragments produced by an excited nuclear source are investigated using the microcanonical {{version of the}} Statistical Multifragmentation Model, with discrete energy. We focus on the fragments' properties at the breakup stage, before they have time to <b>deexcite</b> by particle emission. Since the adopted model provides the excitation energy distribution of these primordial fragments, it allows one to calculate the temperatures of different isotope families and infer on the sensitivity to their isospin composition. It is found that, due to the functional form of the nuclear density of states and the excitation energy distribution of the fragments, proton rich isotopes are hotter than neutron rich ones. This property has been taken to be an indication of earlier emission of the former from a source that cools down as it expands and emits fragments. Although this scenario is incompatible with the prompt breakup of a thermally equilibrated source, our results reveal that the latter framework also provides the same qualitative features just mentioned. Therefore they suggest that this property cannot be taken as evidence for non-equilibrium emission. We also found that this sensitivity to the isotopic composition of the fragments depends on the isospin composition of the source, {{and that it is}} weakened as the excitation energy of the source increases.

40|$|We explore {{collisions}} {{of atomic}} particles {{in two different}} regimes. In {{the first part of}} this work, we study atom-atom collisions of alkali metals at ultracold temperatures and conditions typically found in modern experiments. Feshbach resonances induced by external magnetic fields present a way to change collisional properties and exhibit control over cold collisions. We perform a fully quantum coupled-channel calculation in molecular orbital formalism to calculate collisional properties and characterize Feshbach resonances in ultracold Li+Na and Li+Rb systems. Furthermore, we use the results of these calculations as a foundation to propose a novel scheme for formation of stable ultracold molecules in their lowest rovibrational level. The formation scheme relies on the fact that the photoassociation rate becomes greatly enhanced in the vicinity of a Feshbach resonance, resulting in a large increase of the number of produced excited molecules. Efficient production of stable ultracold molecules is a prerequisite for realization of various proposed platforms for quantum computing with neutral atoms and molecules. In addition, we suggest a way to exploit specifics of the photoassociation rate behavior near its minimum for a precision measurement experiment to detect hypothetical variation of the electron-proton mass ratio in time. ^ The second part of this study examines ion-atom collisions in our solar system. Highly charged ions present in the solar wind collide with neutrals, capture one or more electrons into high excited states and <b>deexcite,</b> radiating energetic X-ray and UV photons.
