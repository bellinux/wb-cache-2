5|$|After {{the first}} two shows of season two, Jim Shelley in The Guardian, called The Wire the best show on TV, praising the second season {{for its ability to}} <b>detach</b> from its former {{foundations}} in the first season. Jon Garelick with the Boston Phoenix was of the opinion that the subculture of the docks (second season) was not as absorbing as that of the housing projects (first season), but he went on to praise the writers for creating a realistic world and populating it with an array of interesting characters.|$|E
5|$|Argasid ticks, unlike ixodid ticks, may {{go through}} {{up to seven}} nymphal stages (instars), {{requiring}} a meal of blood each time. Their life cycles range from months to years. The adult female argasid tick can lay a few hundred to over a thousand eggs {{over the course of}} her lifetime. Larvae feed very quickly and <b>detach</b> to molt into nymphs. Both male and female adults feed on blood, and they mate off the host. During feeding, any excess fluid is excreted by the coxal glands, a process which is unique to argasid ticks.|$|E
5|$|Ben Hildebrand and 12-year-old Eric Kirby go parasailing {{around the}} waters of Isla Sorna. An unknown {{creature}} attacks and kills the boat crew, forcing Ben to <b>detach</b> the line; he and Eric drift towards the island. On the mainland, Dr. Alan Grant has become famous after his involvement at Jurassic Park, while Ellie Sattler is married and has two children. Grant discusses with Sattler how raptors are far more intelligent than they had previously believed. At a dig site, Grant's assistant, Billy Brennan, demonstrates how he can use a 3D printer to replicate a Velociraptor larynx.|$|E

5|$|Following her {{commissioning}} {{into the}} fleet, Emden {{was assigned to}} the East Asia Squadron. In 1913, Korvettenkapitän (Corvette Captain) Karl von Müller became the ship's commander. At the outbreak of war, Emden was the only major German warship in Tsingtao, the main German naval base in Asia. Müller immediately began to operate as a commerce raider, and captured one ship, the Russian steamer Ryazan. Emden was thereafter ordered to rendezvous with the rest of Spee's cruisers. She remained with the East Asia Squadron for only a few days, as Müller convinced Spee to <b>detach</b> Emden as an independent raider in the Indian Ocean.|$|E
5|$|In 1863, a new {{railroad}} {{bridge was}} constructed {{adjacent to the}} Long Bridge {{as part of a}} plan to strengthen the logistics of the Army of the Potomac as it operated in northern Virginia. An extension of the Orange and Alexandria Railroad, the bridge would be used until {{the turn of the century}} before being replaced. Owing to the weight of the railroad and the weak strength of the bridge, no locomotives were allowed on the bridge. Prior to crossing the Potomac, the train would <b>detach</b> its locomotive and be pulled across the bridge by a team of horses.|$|E
5|$|It is {{a common}} {{misconception}} that this collision will disrupt the orbits of the planets in the Solar System.

Although the Solar System as a whole could be affected by these events, the Sun and planets are not expected to be disturbed.|$|E

5|$|Ixodid ticks require three hosts, {{and their}} life cycle {{takes at least}} one year to complete. Up to 3,000 eggs are laid on the ground by an adult female tick. When the larvae emerge, they feed {{primarily}} on small mammals and birds. After feeding, they <b>detach</b> from their host and molt to nymphs on the ground, which then feed on larger hosts and molt to adults. Female adults attach to larger hosts, feed, and lay eggs, while males feed very little and occupy larger hosts primarily for mating.|$|E
5|$|Late 1917 saw the High Seas Fleet {{beginning}} to conduct anti-convoy raids in the North Sea between Britain and Norway. In October and December 1917, two British convoys to Norway were intercepted and destroyed by German cruisers and destroyers, prompting Beatty, now the Commander in Chief of the Grand Fleet, to <b>detach</b> several battleships and battlecruisers to protect convoys. This presented to Admiral Scheer {{the opportunity for}} which he had been waiting the entire war: the chance to isolate and eliminate a portion of the Grand Fleet.|$|E
5|$|Many {{proteins}} {{undergo a}} range of posttranslational modifications, when additional chemical groups {{are attached to the}} amino acids in proteins. Some modifications can produce hydrophobic lipoproteins, or hydrophilic glycoproteins. These type of modification allow the reversible targeting of a protein to a membrane. For example, the addition and removal of the fatty acid palmitic acid to cysteine residues in some signaling proteins causes the proteins to attach and then <b>detach</b> from cell membranes.|$|E

5|$|On 20 June 2010, 611 C3 Picassos built between January and March 2010 were {{recalled}} due to incorrectly routed fuel pipes, {{which were}} {{believed to have been}} in contact with the heat shield.

On 24 August 2010, all 13,234 Picassos sold in the UK were recalled because the windscreen trim could deteriorate, and could eventually <b>detach,</b> leading to a loose-fitting windscreen.|$|E
5|$|On 21 July the {{regiment}} was relocated again, {{this time in}} the vicinity of Orléans where it was based for four weeks. The regiment was ordered to <b>detach</b> two Panzer companies and the headquarters unit of the I. Abteilung (1st Department). These units, augmented by other Panzer companies, formed four Schwimm-Panzerabteilungen (amphibious tank departments) for Operation Sea Lion, the planned and aborted invasion of the United Kingdom. The remnants of Panzer-Regiment 2 were then transferred to East Prussia, where they were based at Heiligenbeil, present-day Mamonovo.|$|E

40|$|The {{relationship}} between ammonium accumulation and senescence of <b>detached</b> rice leaves was investigated. Ammonium accumulation in <b>detached</b> rice leaves coincided closely with dark-induced senescence. Exogenous NH 4 Cl and methionine sulfoximine, which caused {{an accumulation of}} ammonium in <b>detached</b> rice leaves, promoted senescence. Treatments such as light and benzyladenine, which retarded senescence, decreased ammonium level in <b>detached</b> rice leaves. Abscisic acid, which promoted senescence, increased ammonium level in <b>detached</b> rice leaves. The current results suggest that ammonium accumulation {{may be involved in}} regulating senescence. Evidence was presented to show that ammonium accumulated in <b>detached</b> rice leaves increases tissue sensitivity to ethylene. The accumulation of ammonium in <b>detached</b> rice leaves during dark-induced senescence is attributed to a decrease in glutamine synthetase activity and an increase in reduction of nitrate.

5|$|The color {{sequence}} of Rublev's icons begins with showing only selected details, climaxing in Rublev's most famous icon, The Trinity.

The film finally ends with the image of horses at river in the rain. To Tarkovsky horses symbolized life, and including horses in the final scene (and in many other scenes in the film) meant that life was the source of all of Rublev's art.|$|E
