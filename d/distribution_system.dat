5|$|At the time, digital {{distribution}} was gaining popularity. The two {{saw it as}} an opportunity to create games without the high financial risk of retail distribution, which they believed would require them to first accumulate funds by working for other video game companies. Thatgamecompany was founded on May 15, 2006, as Chen and Santiago finished their master's degrees. The company soon signed a deal with Sony Computer Entertainment, which had been impressed by Chen's Flash game Flowâ€”a component of his master's thesis at USC. Thatgamecompany was contracted to produce three games for the upcoming PlayStation Network <b>distribution</b> <b>system,</b> and was given startup funding and a location at Sony's offices in Los Angeles.|$|E

30|$|Combined {{water balance}} in the network could be {{calculated}} by real measured data but doing so in real water <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> should be difficult because of unconstructed DMAs (District Metered Areas) and the design error of water <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> Also, periodically operational management is an essential element in water <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> such as finding leaky pipes, management of hydraulic pressure and proper pump operation.|$|R
30|$|In {{comparison}} to transmission <b>systems,</b> <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> have reduced line lengths and limited power flows. This results in very small phase differences between voltage phasors of different buses. Hence, PMUs {{can play an}} important role in monitoring, control, and protection of <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> Previously, utility engineers were only interested in the magnitudes of voltages because of their small value but now because of dynamic load changing due to distributed energy resources (DER), the phase angle is also playing an important part in the analysis of <b>distribution</b> <b>systems.</b> Therefore, ST is gaining importance in the <b>distribution</b> <b>systems</b> and it will only increase with the addition of more DER.|$|R

5|$|Starting in 1738, {{towns in}} New Jersey began issuing liquor {{licenses}} to tavern keepers. Before federal Prohibition in 1919, despite many state liquor statutes, {{the regulation of}} alcoholic beverages in New Jersey was almost exclusively local, with wide variations among municipalities. In 1933, after the repeal of Prohibition, the states were again permitted to regulate alcoholic beverages. Immediately upon the end of Prohibition in 1933, New Jersey instituted the Alcoholic Beverage Control Law, which established and granted rulemaking powers to the Division of Alcoholic Beverage Control. The law also established a three-tier alcohol <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> whereby, with minor exceptions, alcohol manufacturers may only sell to wholesalers, who may only sell to retailers, who may only sell to customers.|$|E

5|$|Although {{it always}} had {{hundreds}} of competitors, Standard Oil gradually gained dominance of oil refining and sales as market share in the United States through horizontal integration, ending up with about 90% of the US market. In the kerosene industry, the company replaced the old <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> with its own vertical system. It supplied kerosene by tank cars that brought the fuel to local markets, and tank wagons then delivered to retail customers, thus bypassing the existing network of wholesale jobbers. Despite improving the quality and availability of kerosene products while greatly reducing their cost to the public (the price of kerosene dropped by nearly 80% {{over the life of}} the company), Standard Oil's business practices created intense controversy. Standard's most potent weapons against competitors were underselling, differential pricing, and secret transportation rebates.|$|E

Due to widespread demand for the film, many other theatres upgraded in order to get the film. Although ticket prices were raised, the upgraded theatres brought people back who had been lost to television. Also, the film's lack of vulgarity was a sign to middle-class family patrons that they could return to the theatre. This film, in addition to the following year's Dilwale Dulhania Le Jayenge, contributed to an increase in Indian cinema attendance of 40% in just two years.|$|E

5|$|In 1893, Edward Dean Adams, {{who headed}} up the Niagara Falls Cataract Construction Company, sought Tesla's opinion on what system {{would be best to}} {{transmit}} power generated at the falls. Over several years, there had been a series of proposals and open competitions on how best to use power generated by the falls. Among the systems proposed by several US and European companies were two-phase and three-phase AC, high-voltage DC, and compressed air. Adams pumped Tesla for information about the current state of all the competing systems. Tesla advised Adams that a two-phased system would be the most reliable, and that there was a Westinghouse system to light incandescent bulbs using two-phase alternating current. The company awarded a contract to Westinghouse Electric for building a two-phase AC generating system at the Niagara Falls, based on Tesla's advice and Westinghouse's demonstration at the Columbian Exposition that they could build a complete AC system. At the same time, a further contract was awarded to General Electric to build the AC <b>distribution</b> <b>system.</b>|$|E

5|$|John von Neumann, {{working with}} Oskar Morgenstern {{on the theory}} of games, broke new {{mathematical}} ground in 1944 by extending functional analytic methods related to convex sets and topological fixed-point theory to economic analysis. Their work thereby avoided the traditional differential calculus, for which the maximumâ€“operator {{did not apply to}} non-differentiable functions. Continuing von Neumann's work in cooperative game theory, game theorists Lloyd S. Shapley, Martin Shubik, HervÃ© Moulin, Nimrod Megiddo, Bezalel Peleg influenced economic research in politics and economics. For example, research on the fair prices in cooperative games and fair values for voting games led to changed rules for voting in legislatures and for accounting for the costs in publicâ€“works projects. For example, cooperative game theory was used in designing the water <b>distribution</b> <b>system</b> of Southern Sweden and for setting rates for dedicated telephone lines in the USA.|$|E
