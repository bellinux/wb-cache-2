40|$|Retinal {{photography}} and angiography {{is the process}} of documenting a person 2 ̆ 7 s retina, the inside lining of the eye, using a specially designed camera. Traditionally, these images have been recorded on both color slide and black and white film. Recent technological advances in electronic /digital imaging have led to new means of recording these retinal images. These images may be viewed on a computer monitor, but typically these images are printed to a high resolution /addressability output device. By utilizing a high resolution /addressability ink jet printer {{it may be possible to}} produce output of these images at a quality equal to those produced by a <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> <b>printer.</b> This thesis project investigates the possibility that a 720 x 720 dots per inch ink jet printer can be used as an alternative to a far more expensive 300 dots per inch black and white <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> <b>printer.</b> A total of two different retinal angiograms were printed on each device. The standard output from the <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> <b>printer</b> was judged with three different substrates from the ink jet printer, plain paper, coated paper, and photographic quality paper. Each angiogram has four separate pages. These pages are 8. 5 inches x 11 inches with 1, 4, 9, and 16 images per page. Each page was printed on the follow substrates: Kodak Ektatherm print paper, Hammermill plain paper, Canon HR 101 high resolution paper, and Kodak Photographic Quality Ink Jet Paper. The study involved visual evaluation of the images by fifteen ophthalmologists experienced at looking at and interpreting angiograms. Under standard /normal viewing conditions, the fifteen judges compared the four pages (1 up, 4 up, 9 up and 16 up) generated from the Kodak <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> <b>printer</b> and the identical images printed on the Canon BJC 620 ink jet printer on the three different substrates. They judged each series and rated each output acceptable or unacceptable for use in the following areas: diagnosis and treatment, chart copy, and referral copy. Their evaluations were recorded using a response sheet. The results of this experiment are be shown as a percentage of acceptable or unacceptable for each substrate and image layout (1 up, 4 up, 9 up and 16 up) ...|$|E

5000|$|Printing {{techniques}} and digital manipulation {{of art and}} photography are used in {{what is known as}} [...] "custom tile printing". <b>Dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> <b>printers,</b> inkjet printers and ceramic inks and toners permit printing on a variety of tile types yielding photographic-quality reproduction. Using digital image capture via scanning or digital cameras, bitmap/raster images can be prepared in photo editing software programs. Specialized custom-tile printing techniques permit transfer under heat and pressure or the use of high temperature kilns to fuse the picture to the tile substrate. This has become a method of producing custom tile murals for kitchens, showers, and commercial decoration in restaurants, hotels, and corporate lobbies.|$|R
50|$|Instant Print Stations - This type of photo kiosk uses {{internal}} printers to instantly create photographic prints for a self serve paying customer.

40|$|Due to {{environmental}} concerns, {{there is a}} trend to avoid the use of chemicals needed to develop negatives and to process photographic paper, and to use digital technologies instead. Digital technology also offers the advantages that it is convenient, as it enables quick access to the end result, allows image storage and processing on computer, allows rapid hard copy output, and simplifies electronic publishing. Recently significant improvements {{have been made to}} the performance and cost of camera-sensors and printers. In this paper, field ion images recorded with two digital cameras of different resolution are compared to images recorded on standard 35 mm negative film. It should be noted that field ion images exhibit low light intensity and high contrast. Field ion images were recorded from a standard microchannel plate and a phosphor screen and had acceptance angles of {approximately} 60 {degree}. Digital recordings were made with a Digital Vision Technologies (DVT) MICAM VHR 1000 camera with a resolution of 752 x 582 pixels, and a Kodak DCS 460 digital camera with a resolution of 3, 060 x 2, 036 pixels. Film based recordings were made with Kodak T-MAX film rated at 400 ASA. The resolving power of T-MAX film, as specified by Kodak, is between 50 and 125 lines per mm, which corresponds to between 1, 778 x 1, 181 and 4, 445 x 2, 953 pixels, i. e. similar to that from the DCS 460 camera. The intensities of the images were sufficient to be recorded with standard fl: 1. 2 lenses with exposure times of less than 2 s. Many digital cameras were excluded from these experiments due to their lack of sensitivity or the inability to record a full frame image due to the fixed working distance defined by the vacuum system. The digital images were output on a Kodak Digital Science 8650 PS <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> color <b>printer</b> (300 dpi). All field ion micrographs presented were obtained from a Ni-Al-Be specimen...|$|R

40|$|There are {{numerous}} techniques {{that can be}} used for the decoration of polymeric substrates, <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation,</b> self-colouring, paint spraying, granular injection paint technology, pad printing, in-mould decoration and hot foil stamping. <b>Dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> was selected for this research as it was found to be both the most relevant technology area for IDT Systems Limited and the least understood. It is a customisable digital process which uses specialist Cyan, Magenta, Yellow and Black (CMYK) inkjet-able dyes that are transferred into a substrate via a carrier. During the process heat is applied which transforms the dyes from a solid into a gas phase. Analysis of literature identified a number of knowledge gaps, which are addressed during this research and detailed in this report. Initial experimentation concluded that the <b>sublimation</b> <b>dyes</b> can penetrate a range of commercially available amorphous polymers, comparably to semi-crystalline types. These findings dispute previously published work, but these also lacked rigorously recorded methodologies to confirm comparable data. All of the materials, equipment and methodologies used throughout this research were therefore developed in this report. Further detailed experimentation was completed, using amorphous polycarbonate, (PC) and semi-crystalline polybutylene terephthalate, (PBT) focusing on the process time and temperature to understand their influence on the level of dye penetration. The results revealed that increasing the process temperature and time improves the level of dye penetration and that comparable penetration levels were noted at 140 - 180 oC. Further research identified the importance of free volume in the polymer, this increases in size and connectivity as temperature increases above the glass transition points. Additional experimentation confirms that the free volume enables the dyes to penetrate into the polymer. Characterisation of the CMYK <b>sublimation</b> <b>dyes</b> was completed using Differential Scanning Calorimetry enabling the thermal transitions to be identified. Visual experimentation confirmed that the dyes start and finish sublimation between 145 - 210 oC. As no software tool existed to visualise the dye penetration, one was developed using MatLab. The tool imports and then interpolates the data and graphically outputs it for the user. This allows a quicker set up time of the process and reduces the number of samples to be destroyed. As a direct result of the innovations described in this report, the industrial sponsor has benefited with an increase in commercial exploitation.

The reason for these differences was investigated. Experimentation was conducted on a range of semi-crystalline and amorphous polymers. These were decorated using a standard cyan, magenta, yellow and black pattern. The level of dye penetration was measured using optical microscopy It was found that the dye penetrated the semi-crystalline polymers approximately ten times more than in the amorphous polymers. There are disparities between the measured values here and previously published data. These disparities were found to exist as a result of large operating processing temperatures and times...|$|R
50|$|In {{order to}} {{transfer}} the image from the paper to the substrate, it requires a heat press process that {{is a combination of}} time, temperature and pressure. The heat press applies this special combination, which can change depending on the substrate, to “transfer” the <b>sublimation</b> <b>dyes</b> at the molecular level into the substrate.

5000|$|The dye-sublimation {{printing}} process {{is used to}} print on polyester or other synthetic fabrics. It is used for applications such as T-shirts, banners, table covers, id cards, sportswear and flags. The original printers were an electrostatic technology using toners but now are generally large format inkjet printers using specially formulated inks. The <b>dye</b> <b>sublimation</b> inks are a disperse dye suspended in a liquid solvent, like water. The images are initially printed on coated heat-resistant transfer paper as a reverse image of the final design, which is then transferred onto polyester fabric in a heat press operating at a temperature around 180 to 210 C (375 F). Under high temperature and pressure, the dye turns into a gas and permeates the fabric and then solidifies into its fibers. The fabric is permanently dyed {{so it can be}} washed without damaging the quality of the image. Shelfies and Blue Notes are two such companies that use this method.|$|R
