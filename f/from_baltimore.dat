5|$|The {{first major}} congressional debate in which Rowan participated {{was over the}} {{election}} of William McCreery as representative <b>from</b> <b>Baltimore,</b> Maryland. Joshua Barney, McCreery's opponent in the election, claimed that McCreery did not meet a requirement in the Maryland Constitution that a representative live in the district from which he was elected for twelve {{months prior to the}} election. McCreery admitted that he had moved <b>from</b> <b>Baltimore</b> to the country prior to the election but claimed that he still owned his home in Baltimore and lived there during the winter months. A resolution was introduced to declare McCreery the duly elected representative <b>from</b> <b>Baltimore,</b> and an amendment was added to clarify that the grounds upon which the resolution was based were that McCreery had not abandoned his Baltimore home. Despite his support for states' rights, Rowan opposed the amendment because he felt that state sovereignty was only made possible by national sovereignty and that the national legislature had the right to declare a state law unconstitutional. By giving another reason for declaring McCreery duly elected, Rowan felt this issue would be obscured. The amendment was defeated by a vote of 92–8, and the resolution to declare McCreery duly elected passed 89–18.|$|E

5|$|The {{outbreak}} of the Civil War in April 1861 immediately affected the Baltimore Steam Packet Company. On April 19, two days after Virginia's secession, a violently pro-Southern mob in Baltimore attacked Union soldiers en route to Washington, D.C. as the troops marched through the city's streets between railroad stations. Thereafter known as the Baltimore riot of 1861, the resulting loss of life and local unrest also threatened the , a U.S. Navy ship in Baltimore at the time. Later that same day, the Baltimore Steam Packet Company declined to transport Union forces <b>from</b> <b>Baltimore</b> to the beleaguered Union naval yard facility at Portsmouth, Virginia.|$|E
5|$|In 1963, Rangers {{governor}} William Jennings {{introduced to}} his peers {{the idea of}} expanding the league to the American West Coast by adding two new teams for the 1964–65 season. While the governors did not agree to the proposal, the topic of expansion came up every time the owners met from then on out. In 1965, {{it was decided to}} expand by six teams, doubling the size of the NHL. In February 1966, the governors met and decided to award franchises to Los Angeles, Minnesota, Philadelphia, Pittsburgh, Oakland and St. Louis. The league rejected bids <b>from</b> <b>Baltimore,</b> Buffalo and Vancouver. In Canada, there was widespread outrage over the denial of an expansion team to Vancouver in 1967; three years later, the NHL awarded a franchise to Vancouver, which formerly played in the Western Hockey League, for the 1970–71 season, along with the Buffalo Sabres.|$|E
5|$|In July 1877, {{a violent}} {{railroad}} strike began in Martinsburg, West Virginia, sparking riots in other American cities, such as Pittsburgh and Philadelphia. In response, President Rutherford B. Hayes authorized {{the use of}} the military to put down the rioting. During the crisis, Tilley was temporarily transferred to , sailing up the Potomac River to Washington, D.C. Military leaders feared that rioters <b>from</b> <b>Baltimore</b> could travel to Washington to seize or damage vulnerable government targets. The troops defending Washington, including army, navy, and marines, were organized into a battalion of seven companies (Naval Brigade) under the command of Captain Edward Barrett; Tilley was placed in command of Company C. The precautions proved to be unnecessary, as the expected wave of rioters never materialized following the military's suppression of the strikers in Baltimore. Within a short time, the riots in other cities were also quashed.|$|E

5|$|Mathias' {{candidacy}} consideration did not endear him to {{the conservative}} wing of the Maryland Republican Party organization. In June 1976, he lost a vote by state Republicans to determine who would represent Maryland on the platform committee at the 1976 Republican National Convention. Instead, the group chose George Price, a conservative member of the Maryland House of Delegates <b>from</b> <b>Baltimore</b> County. At one point, Mathias was close to being denied attendance to the convention altogether as an at-large delegate, but a last minute compromise ensured all Republican congressional representatives seats as at-large delegates. Mathias maintained a low profile during the convention, and received harsh criticism {{from some of the}} conservative delegates from Maryland who attended.|$|E

5|$|The 1850 Atlantic {{hurricane}} season {{was the most}} recent season excluded from {{the scope of the}} official Atlantic hurricane database. Although meteorological records are sparse and generally incomplete, they indicate that three significant tropical cyclones affected land, each causing some degree of damage. The first system struck North Carolina on July 18, causing significant damage before battering the Mid-Atlantic states with high tides, strong winds, and heavy rainfall. Torrential rainfall caused river flooding <b>from</b> <b>Baltimore</b> to Philadelphia, particularly along the Schuylkill River, which took the lives of 20 people in various incidents. Strong winds damaged property and public facilities in and around New York City, and damaging floods extended into central and northern New England. Crops and railroad infrastructure suffered throughout the entire region.|$|E

5|$|In 1911, Georgia Avenue was {{proposed}} {{as a state}} highway between the Washington, D.C. border and Brookeville. This section of state highway was completed by 1915.
