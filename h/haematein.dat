In the Colour Index (but nowhere else), <b>haematein</b> is called haematine, a confusing word that wrongly implies that the compound is an amine.|$|E

50|$|Hematein {{exhibits}} indicator-like properties, being {{blue and}} less soluble in aqueous alkaline conditions, {{and red and}} more soluble in alcoholic acidic conditions. Dissolved <b>haematein</b> slowly reacts with atmospheric oxygen, yielding products that are not useful.|$|E
5000|$|The {{three main}} alum {{haematoxylin}} solutions employed are Ehrlich's haematoxylin, Harris's haematoxylin, and Mayer's haematoxylin. The name haemalum {{is preferable to}} [...] "haematoxylin" [...] for these solutions because <b>haematein,</b> a product of oxidation of haematoxylin, is the compound that combines with aluminium ions to form the active dye-metal complex. Alum haematoxylin solutions impart to the nuclei of cells a light transparent red stain that rapidly turns blue on exposure to any neutral or alkaline liquid.|$|E
5000|$|Haematoxylin or {{hematoxylin}} (...) , {{also called}} natural black 1 or C.I. 75290, is a compound {{extracted from the}} heartwood of the logwood tree (Haematoxylum campechianum). Haematoxylin and eosin together make up haematoxylin and eosin stain, {{one of the most}} commonly used stains in histology. This type of stain is a permanent stain as opposed to temporary stains (e.g. iodine solution in KI). Another common stain is phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin, a mix of haematoxylin with phosphotungstic acid. When oxidized, it forms <b>haematein,</b> a compound that forms strongly coloured complexes with certain metal ions, the most notable ones being Fe(III) and Al(III) salts. Metal-haematein complexes are used to stain cell nuclei prior to examination under a microscope. Structures that stain with iron- or aluminium-haematein are often called basophilic, even though the mechanism of the staining is different from that of staining with basic dyes.|$|E
5000|$|Perkin {{was elected}} a Fellow of the Royal Society in June 1903 and awarded their Davy Medal in 1924 [...] "for his {{researches}} {{on the structure}} of natural colouring matters". His candidacy citation for the Royal Society read [...] "Research Chemist in the Clothworker's Dyeing School, Yorkshire College, Leeds. Distinguished for his researches in Organic Chemistry, and especially in the section of this subject which comprises vegetable colouring matters. The results of these researches are published in upwards of 60 papers in the 'Journal of the Chemical Society.' Partly in conjunction with the late Prof J J Hummel he investigated Chay Root, Rubia Sikkimensis, and other similar plants, and succeeded in isolating and clearly proving the constitution of the Anthracene derivatives which they contain. His researches on Mang-kondu, Ventilago madraspatana , and many other plants largely used in India, Java, and elsewhere, on account of their valuable dyeing properties, have not only made us acquainted with the dyeing principles contained in these plants, but their chemical investigation has, in nearly all cases, led to a clear conception of their constitution. During the course of his researches on luteolin, morin, apinin, quercitin, and other flavone compounds, he discovered and investigated curious compounds which such dyestuffs forms with acids. This work has afforded a valuable means of determining the molecular weight of such substances. In another paper he has described a new behaviour of colouring matters, which consists in their forming crystalline potassium salts when treated with potassium acetate. As only colouring matters which contain two hydroxyls relatively in the other position show this behaviour, the test affords further means of determining constitution. His researches include the investigation of the valuable compounds which colouring matters and other substances form with Diazobenzine chloride and the careful examination of the glucosides, tannins, Catechus, and similar compounds closely allied to the natural colouring matters. He has also published important investigations on Resorcylic Acid and its derivatives, on <b>haematein</b> and brazilein, on Kamala, purpurogallin, etc, etc." ...|$|E
40|$|Unmordanted <b>haematein</b> in aqueous {{solution}} varies in colour from yellowish orange at pH 3 to bluish magenta at pH 9. In the presence of aluminium sulphate, the colour of solutions of <b>haematein</b> at any particular pH depends {{on the number of}} aluminium atoms to each molecule of haema-tein. At pH 4 - 6 the colour varies from yellowish orange through dull red to rose as the number of aluminium atoms to each molecule of <b>haematein</b> is increased from •J to 8. The facts suggest that such solutions contain both uncombined <b>haematein</b> and an aluminium-haematein compound. From about pH 5 upwards the aluminium-haematein compound is insoluble. Although the dominant colour is blue, a considerable proportion of red light is trans-mitted. The blue colour attaches itself to tissue-constituents like a typical cationic (basic dye. It combines principally with the nucleic acids of chromatin; but if these are extracted from the tissues, it attaches itself to the acidic proteins of chromatin, and the appearance given is much the same...|$|E
40|$|Staining of semi-thin {{sections}} of osmium-fixed epoxy resin (Epon or Araldite) -embedded tissues with haematoxylin and acid dyes as counterstains (eosin or phloxin) was successfully achieved after intense oxidation using hydrogen peroxide as the oxygen donor.

Preliminary studies show that similarly good results, comparable with standard paraffinembedded histological materials, can be obtained, using H 2 O 2 pretreatment, with Weigert's iron haematoxylin, Mallory's phosphotungstic acid haematoxylin, Alcian blue, PAS reaction, Sudan III, Sudan black, oil red, Gomori's aldehyde fuchsin, and Baker's acid <b>haematein...</b>|$|E
40|$|The {{corrosion}} {{inhibition of}} carbon steel in 0. 1 M NaNO 3 solution using haematoxylin (HX), IUPAC name 7, 11 b-Dihydroindeno[2, 1 -c]chromene- 3, 4, 6 a, 9, 10 (6 H) -pentol was studied using electrochemical measurements such as: potentiodynamic polarization and electrochemical impedance spectroscopy (EIS) {{in association with}} UV-Vis spectrophotometry. Microscopic images were {{used to examine the}} surface morphology. Electrochemical results showed that, for 1. 0 mM HX in natrium nitrate solution, the corrosion current density (icorr) had the lowest value (11. 5 μA cm- 2), and the highest polarization resistance (Rp) was obtained (498. 6 Ω cm 2), and consequently, an inhibition efficiency (IE) of 81. 6 ± 2 % for HX was reached. A synergic action mechanism of HX was proposed related to the organic film formation consisting in haematoxylin and its oxidized form <b>haematein</b> (HT) adsorption, supplemented by evidence of HT complexes with Fe 3 +, and an additional process of HX electropolymerization. By optical microscopy, the feature of the uniform layer on the surface was nuanced for carbon steel corroded in 0. 1 M NaNO 3 solution containing 1. 0 mM HX...|$|E
40|$|Natural organic dyes {{suffer from}} {{degradation}} during the time. Therefore, {{the works of}} art need to be restored and the identification of dyes by analytical methods is important here. The possibilities of using three separation (thin-layer chromatography - TLC, capillary zone electrophoresis - CZE, and micellar electrokinetic chromatography - MEKC) and two spectroscopic (infrared microspectroscopy - IR and Raman microspectroscopy) methods for the identification of red dyes (acaroid, brazil, dragon blood, kamala, logwood, cochineal, madder, lac, and sandalwood) were studied and critically discussed. In TLC, under optimised conditions (silicagel with octadecyl, 80 / 20 (v/v) MeOH/ 1 % TEA in 0. 1 mol·dm- 3 acetate buffer, pH 5, and 80 / 20 (v/v) MeOH/ 1 % TEA in 0. 025 mol·dm- 3 tetraborate buffer, pH 7 and 9), the stain broadening of sandalwood, logwood, acaroid, dragon blood, and brazil was observed. Carminic acid, <b>haematein</b> and purpurin were not detected. A comparison of CZE and MEKC showed that MEKC was superior as it permits separation of all analytes, using 0. 015 mol·dm- 3 sodium dodecyl sulfate in 0. 01 mol·dm- 3 tetraborate buffer, pH 8. 5, at a voltage of 20 kV.

40|$|The author's Sudan black {{technique}} has been improved {{by changes in}} fixation. One may fix as for the acid <b>haematein</b> test, or else in a modified Flemming's fluid. The former fixation allows very strong colouring by Sudan black, while the latter gives particularly faithful preservation of {{the form of the}} cells and their lipid inclusions. DURING the past few years I have sought to improve my Sudan blacktechnique (Baker, 1949), which is a general method for revealing lipids of all kinds. I have tried to make the test more sensitive. Many cytoplasmic globules contain but do not consist of lipid. Probably they are aqueous 'vacuoles ' with lipid dispersed in them. Certain lipids, especially cerebrosides and phospholipids, are capable of such dispersion, and the vacuole containing them may be of quite low refractive index. Sudan black will only reveal the lipid content of such globules if special precautions are taken to prevent the escape of the lipid. Other lipid globules are so small that they may be over-looked unless the Sudan black acts very vigorously. I have also sought to improve the fixation. The form of the globules was well preserved by the old method, but nevertheless there was room for im...|$|E
40|$|International audienceBACKGROUND AND AIMS: A {{previous}} study {{suggested that the}} presence of myenteric plexitis in the proximal resection margins could be predictive of early endoscopic recurrence after ileocolonic or ileal resection for Crohn's disease (CD). The aim {{of the present study was}} to assess the predictive value of plexitis for early clinical CD recurrence. METHODS: All consecutive patients with ileocolonic or ileal resection for active CD in Lariboisière Hospital (Paris) between 1995 and 2006 were included. Clinical, surgical, histological and follow-up data were extracted from medical charts. Early clinical recurrence was defined as the reappearance of CD clinical manifestations requiring a specific treatment within 2 years postsurgery. The proximal resection margin was analysed using <b>haematein</b> eosin saffron (HES) staining and immunochemistry targeting mastocytes (anti-CD 117 antibody) and lymphocytes (anti-CD 3 antibody). Eosinophils were detected by HES staining. Ten cases of ileocolonic resections for caecal carcinoma served as controls. RESULTS: Data were available from 171 postoperative follow-up periods in 164 patients with CD. Early clinical recurrence of CD occurred in 28. 1 %. In multivariate analysis, factors associated with postoperative recurrence were active smoking (hazard ratio (HR) = 1. 94; 95 % CI 1. 06 to 3. 60; p = 0. 033), submucosal plexitis with >or= 3 mastocytes (HR = 1. 87; 95 % CI 1. 00 to 3. 46; p = 0. 048) and a disease-free resection margin < 5 cm (HR = 0. 52; 95 % CI 0. 27 to 1. 02; p = 0. 059). CONCLUSIONS: Submucosal plexitis is associated with early clinical recurrence and could be taken into account in studies searching for new treatment strategies in the immediate postoperative period...|$|E
