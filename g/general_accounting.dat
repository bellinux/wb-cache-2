5|$|A {{number of}} press reports came {{out during the}} Ethics Committee's work that purported to reveal aspects of the {{investigations}}. Chair Heflin was upset by the leaks and two investigations into them were held, one by the <b>General</b> <b>Accounting</b> Office {{acting on behalf of}} the committee and one by the Senate's Temporary Special Independent Counsel. Neither report reached a conclusive finding or directly implicated anyone in the leaks. The special counsel report, released in 1992, ascribed partisanship as the motive for the leaks and said they were intended to hurt DeConcini, Riegle, and Cranston; it also gave an inference that McCain and his staff were responsible for key leaks.|$|E

5|$|In March 1996, the US <b>General</b> <b>Accounting</b> Office (GAO) {{stated that}} it was cheaper to buy HarrierIIPlus {{aircraft}} outright than to remanufacture existing AV-8Bs. The USN estimated the cost for remanufacture of each aircraft to be US$23–30million, instead of $30million for each new-built aircraft, while the GAO estimated the cost per new aircraft at $24million. Nevertheless, the program continued and, in 2003, the 72nd and last AV-8B to be remanufactured for the USMC was delivered. Spain also participated in the program, the delivery of its last refurbished aircraft occurring in December 2003, which {{marked the end of}} the AV-8B's production; the final new AV-8B had been delivered in 1997.|$|E

40|$|Even {{though the}} {{increase}} {{of the number of}} persons with disability and registered persons with disability caused the balance of the Fund to be aggravated, there have been only a few studies to solve the problems of the Fund. Therefore, this study aims to understand the status of the financial resourses for the employment policy of persons with disability and to clarify the problems in South Korea by comparing and analyzing the current financial resources for the employment policies of persons with disability between South Korea and Japan. As for the study method, literature review was employed to analyze the literatures and information related to financial resources of employment policy for persons with disability mainly focusing on the revenue account among the accounts of budget to implement the employment policy for person with disability. The biggest difference between financial resources to perform the employment policy for persons with disability of Japan and South Korea is from the total amount of budget and the distribution ratio of <b>General</b> <b>Account,</b> Social Insurance and the share. While in Japan the employment policies for persons with disability are financed by the <b>General</b> <b>Account</b> and Social Insurance much more than the Share, in South Korea, they are financed by the Share more than the <b>General</b> <b>Account</b> and Employment Insurance. Therefore, as the budget scale from <b>General</b> <b>Account</b> is significantly low, to stably implement the employment business for persons with disability, the budget scale from <b>General</b> <b>Account</b> and Social Insurance...|$|R

40|$|This {{review is}} a {{critical}} discussion of three main claims in Debs and Redhead’s thought-provoking book Objectivity, Invariance, and Convention. These claims are: (i) Social acts impinge upon formal aspects of scientific representation; (ii) symmetries introduce the need for conventional choice; (iii) perspectival symmetry is a necessary and sufficient condition for objectivity, while symmetry simpliciter fails to be necessary. Much work {{in the philosophy of}} science falls into one of two camps. On the one hand, we have the system builders. Often with the help of formal methods, these philosophers aim at a <b>general</b> <b>account</b> of theories and models, explanation and confirmation, scientific theory change, and so on. Here, examples from the sciences are at best illustrations of the philosophical claims in question. On the other hand, we find those philosophers who, dissatisfied by <b>general</b> <b>accounts</b> and often prompted by a close study of the history of science, present detailed accounts of very specific parts of science, without aiming at the development of a <b>general</b> <b>account.</b> If a <b>general</b> <b>account</b> of science is referred to at all, it is refuted (by a case study) or only used to describe a certain episode of scientific research. Although both of these approaches have their merits and limitations, very few re-search projects span the whole range of philosophy of science, such that results from <b>general</b> <b>accounts</b> are non-trivially applied to case studies of specific sciences. It is a virtue of Debs and Redhead’s book (2007, page numbers refer to this work) that the...|$|R
