Human activity creates urban soils that are distinct from their natural counterpart for physical, chemical and biological features. Surface crusting is water- and gas-repellent, with restricted aeration and water <b>drainage.</b> <b>Vertical</b> and spatial variability is great. Anthropogenic materials and contaminants are present. Soil structure is modified leading to compaction. Nutrient cycling is interrupted and soil organism activity modified. Environmental chemical pollution is a key stress factor for plants in urban areas. The objective of pruning urban trees is to produce safe, strong, healthy, attractive plants, but wounds produced by topping and improper pruning may serve as entry points for decay organisms. There are particular cases where individual trees, because of their condition and location, pose an unacceptable risk to people or property. Trees or tree parts can fail particularly during loading events such as wind and snow storms. Trees fail when the load (weight and motion of the crown) exceeds the mechanical strength of their stems, branches or root systems. This is true for both sound and defective trees, but defective individuals can only withstand a fraction of the load that sound trees can withstand. The failure of limbs or entire trees, however, is often predictable, detectable, and preventable. Tree risk analysis has evolved over time from a qualitative art to a quantitative science. Modern techniques and procedures can be used to minimize the risks associated with tree failure and to identify structural defects. So, the mission of urban plant pathologists is to verify if a tree has what it takes to stand up in a secure way. This is based on the evaluation of the acceptable safety factor (safe shell limits). Trained and able staff must be available for periodical tree inspections. University courses of Agricultural and Forest Sciences should discuss and deepen these crucial issues...|$|E

En Amérique du Sud,la forêt est généralement remplacée par une prairie, C'est pourquoi nous avons étudié le {{comportement}} hydrologique de 2 petits (1, 5 ha) bassins versants. Un bassin (bassin B) est recouvert par une forêt primaire, {{tandis que}} le second (bassin A) a été défriché et transformé en prairie (Digitaria swazilandensis, programme ÉCÉREX, ORSTOM/CTFT). Ces bassins, situés en Guyane Française, sont proches (500 m), escarpés et principalement constitués par des sols à <b>drainage</b> <b>vertical</b> ralenti. Le climat est de type tmpical humide avec une température moyenne (26 °C) et des précipitations moyennes annuelles (3500 à 3900 mm/an) élevées. L'évapotranspiration réelle et potentielle de la forêt primaire sont respectivement égales à 1470 mm/an et 1565 mm/an, En période d'étiage, nous avons observé un écoulement permanent à l'exutoire du bassin A, alors que le bassin B en est dépourvu. Deux crues (24 mai 1992 et 15 mai 1993) ont été étudiées, simultanément sur les 2 bassins. Pendant les crues, nous avons prélevé des échantillons d'eau des précipitations (pluie et pluviolessivat), des ruisseaux et du sol. Sur ces sites, l'eau circulant dans les couches peu profondes du sol présente une concentration élevée en K+ et faible en Cl-. Une signature opposée caractérise l'eau des couches pmfondes du sol. L'analyse des relations existant entre les traceurs chimiques (K+, Cl-) et isotopique l 80) ainsi l'étude des propriétés hydrodynamiques du sol permet de décomposer qualitativement l'hydrogramme de crue en 3 réservoirs: sol superficiel (écoulement hypodermique), sol intermédiaire (de 0 à - 0, 4 m), sol profond (bassin B) ou nappe (bassin A). Une décomposition quantitative a été effectuée en utilisant des traceurs chimique (Cl-) et isotopique l 80). Nous avons ainsi montré que les crues sur les 2 bassins sont dominées par l'écoulement issu des couches intermédiaires du sol qui représente environ la moitié de l'écoulement total de crue. Cependant,les mécanismes de génération des crues diffèrent sur les 2 bassins. Sur le bassin A, les couches profondes du sol sont saturées avant la crue et participent donc à la totalité de la crue. Au contraire, sur le bassin B, les couches profondes de sol atteignent la saturation peu de temps avant le pic de crue et participent donc essentiellement aux écoulement pendant la décrue. Ces résultats confirment les études hydrologiques réalisées précédemment (FRITSCH, 199 Ù) et permettent d'identifier les mécanismes de genèse des crues et ainsi de mettre en évidence l'effet de la déforestation. The tropical regions {{are subjected to}} fast deforestation. In South America, the tropical rain forest is being replaced by grassland. Thus, we have studied the hydrological behaviour of two small (1. 5 ha) watersheds. One basin (hereafter named "B" basin) is still covered by primary forest while the second one (hereafter named "A" basin) was cleared and transformed to grassland (Digitaria swazilandensis, ÉCÉREX program, supported by ORSTOM/CTFT). These basins, located in French Guyana, are close to one another (500 m), steep, and are principally constituted of soils showing lateral drainage. The tropical humid climate {{is characterized by a}} high mean interannual temperature (26 ¡C), which varies slightly from month to month, and by a high mean annual precipitation (3500 to 3900 mm yr- 1). Precipitation mainly occurs during the main wet season from May to June and during a secondary wet season from December to January. Real evapotranspiration of the natural forest is 1470 mm yr- 1 and potential evapotranspiration is 1565 mm yr- 1. During the low-water level period, we have observed perennial runoff at the outlet at the "A" basin while the "B" basin is without permanent flow. We have studied two runoff events (24 May 1992 and 15 May 1993) in both basins. On 24 May 1992, the runoff event was caused by a rainfall lasting for about 10 hours. Total precipitation was 53. 8 mm. The main event amounted to 32 mm. The main peak of the hydrograph corresponded to the heaviest rainfalls. On 15 May 1993, the runoff event was caused by a rain lasting for about 13 hours. Total precipitation was 64. 0 mm. The main peak of the hydrograph (86. 2 L s- 1) corresponded again to the heaviest rainfalls. Spatial variability of the precipitation amount was high, especially for the most intense events that have the largest standard deviations. Interception by the canopy amounted to 5. 3 % of the rainfall in 1992 and 4. 3 % in 1993. High rapid runoff coefficients were observed, i. e., 0. 28 for 24 May 1992 and 0. 43 for 15 May 1993. No overland flow was observed in the watershed. Samples of rainwater, throughfall, stream water, and soil water were regularly collected in both watersheds during the runoff events. Temporal variations in the isotopic composition of the stream water at the outlet of the watershed paralleled variations in rainwater but with a distinct shift. The difference between the two signatures could be due to a mixture between:- Rainwater and water present in the watershed before the event and whose isotopic composition is different and variable over space. - Rainwater and water originating from various reservoirs whose contribution to the stream varies with time. The analysis of runoff events using the isotope tracer method revealed the existence in the stream of a mixture of water originating from rain and from one or several other reservoirs in the watershed. Isotope tracers alone were not sufficient to estimate the depth of the soil water contributing to the runoff event. On one hand, temporal variability in the isotopic composition of rainwater was very similar to the vertical spatial variability in the isotopic composition of soil water. On the other hand, surface evaporation in the watershed was negligible: the isotopic signature of water originating from soil during runoff events was the consequence of successive infiltrated rain events. Oxygen- 18 content in rain water strongly varied with time but only slightly with space because of the small area of the watershed. Because of this temporal variability, an average isotope content of rainwater could not be used when calculating the contribution of "new water" at the outlet of the watershed. Using chemical and isotope tracers is a way to identify and quantify the contribution of the various water reservoirs to runoff. We were thus able to separate runoff hydrographs into simple components (water from superficial layer, intermediate layer and deep layer). In these watersheds, shallow water was characterized by relatively high concentration in potassium and very low concentration in chloride. An opposite signature characterized deep waterA "deep water" chemical tracer (chloride) - isotope tracer (18 O) diagram shows the evidence of a hysteresis relationship: 1. The decreasing limb of this relationship (rising segment of the hydrograph) is due to a decrease in heavy isotope content resulting from the decrease of oxygen- 18 content in the precipitation and from the arrival of water from upper soil layers with low concentrations of chloride. 2. The increasing limb (falling segment of the hydrograph and recession) is associated with the arrival at the outlet of deep waters containing relatively high concentrations of chloride and heavy isotopes. Using chemical (Cl-) and isotope (18 O) tracers, quantitative hydrograph separation was achieved with a simple 2 - or 3 - component conservative-mixing model. This information allowed qualitative hydrograph separation into 3 reservoirs: superficial soil layers, intermediate soil layers (0 to - 0. 4 m), deep soil layers ("B" watershed) or ground water ("A" watershed). Thus, the runoff event of both basins was dominated by the intermediate soil layers reservoir, which represents half of the total flow for both basins. However, the processes of runoff generation differ: in the "A" watershed, the deep soil layers were saturated before the rain: the contribution is significant throughout the runoff. In the "B" watershed, the deep soil layers become saturated a few times before the peak flow: their contribution dominates during the recession. These results confirm previous hydrological studies (Fritsch, 1990), which showed the high reactivity of the watershed, and give a better insight into the mechanisms involved. Some of these observations can also be used at a larger scale: 1. Identification of the reservoirs contributing to the runoff event by analyzing the relationships between oxygen- 18 content and the flow rate, and between isotope and chemical tracers. 2. Simultaneous samplings along the stream in order to detect a possible zonation of the watershed. These samples must be taken during a runoff event as well as during a low-water level period to check whether the tracer concentrations in the continuous or discontinuous water table supplying the stream are heterogeneous. If the signature of the water table is heterogeneous or if the stream is supplied by several water tables with different chemical concentrations, the watershed must be divided into several homogeneous sub-watersheds...|$|E

Three groups of tests were conducted on the silty clay from Qinhuai River in Nanjing, China. The model is able to apply vacuum pressure {{at the bottom of}} the soil layer and a direct current electric field simultaneously. It is also possible to measure the pore pressures at different depths of soil column, and the changes in settlement and volume with the elapsed time. In this study, the vacuum preloading method, vacuum preloading applied at the bottom (VAB method), was applied and the cathodes were installed beneath the soil layer. The results obtained indicate substantial reduction in water content, and increases in dry density and undrained shear strength in comparison with those obtained by the vacuum preloading only, particularly at the positions close to the anode. The combined method utilizes the <b>vertical</b> <b>drainage</b> flow created by the electroosmosis integrating the horizontal drainage flow created mostly by the vacuum pressure.

The subsoil of these reclamations often consists of soft, compressible materials, such as marine clay. Depending on the clay properties, {{the thickness of}} the soft layer and {{the thickness of the}} placed sand layer, a certain settlement will occur within a certain consolidation time. To control the occurring settlement and/or to shorten the consolidation time, different measures are available, for instance: installation of prefabricated vertical drains, installation of a temporary surcharge, a combination of <b>vertical</b> <b>drainage</b> and surcharge. The measures above are recapitulated called "soil improvement". During the tender procedure as well as during the actual execution of the reclamation works, it is of great importance to predict the settlement and consolidation time (possibly including a soil improvement) accurately. The main objective was to answer the following question: "Can a probabilistic analysis of the soil parameters and calculation models give a surplus value in the prediction of the settlement, consolidation time and the soil improvement needed?". The conventional method to calculate the consolidation time and the settlement is a deterministic one. From a set of data, a representative value is determined, which is then used in the consolidation calculations. In order to calculate the settlement and consolidation time, with stochastic variables, a Monte Carlo simulation is executed. For this purpose a model has been developed, from which the basic outline is visualised in the left figure.

Unfortunately, multidimensional unsaturated flow phenomena that are necessary for evaluating tilted capillary barriers {{are not included in}} HELP. Differences between the predictions of the HELP and those from a multidimensional unsaturated flow code are presented to assess the two different approaches. Comparisons are presented for the landfill covers including capillary barrier configurations at the Alternative Landfill Cover Demonstration (ALCD) being conducted at Sandia...|$|R
40|$|Since oedema of {{adjacent}} {{tissue is}} a major factor in preventing healing of leg ulcers conservative treatment should aim to dry out the ulcer area before bandaging and to keep it dry afterwards. A method of postural drainage of oedema is described in which the patient lies supine with the legs raised vertically for two days. Non-stretch Viscopaste bandages are then applied and the patient allowed to move about normally, but instructed to continue <b>vertical</b> leg <b>drainage</b> for a period each day. Out of 106 cases treated by this method the leg ulcer healed within a year in 82 (77 · 4 %). Relapses were apt to occur when the patient neglected to continue the <b>vertical</b> <b>drainage</b> regimen after the ulcer had healed. These results compare well with those reported for other methods of treatment. <b>Vertical</b> leg <b>drainage</b> treatment is inexpensive and the patient can continue at work...|$|R
