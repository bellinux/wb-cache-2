5|$|Algebraic K-theory {{is related}} to the group of <b>invertible</b> {{matrices}} with coefficients the given field. For example, the process of taking the determinant of an <b>invertible</b> matrix leads to an isomorphism K1(F) = F. Matsumoto's theorem shows that K2(F) agrees with K2M(F). In higher degrees, K-theory diverges from Milnor K-theory and remains hard to compute in general.|$|E
5|$|A {{group is}} a {{mathematical}} structure consisting {{of a set of}} objects together with a binary operation, that is, an operation combining any two objects to a third, subject to certain requirements. A group in which the objects are matrices and the group operation is matrix multiplication is called a matrix group. Since in a group every element has to be <b>invertible,</b> the most general matrix groups are the groups of all <b>invertible</b> matrices of a given size, called the general linear groups.|$|E
5|$|A {{symmetric}} matrix is positive-definite if {{and only if}} all its eigenvalues are positive, that is, the matrix is positive-semidefinite and it is <b>invertible.</b> The table at the right shows two possibilities for 2-by-2 matrices.|$|E
5|$|If n > m, and if {{the rank}} of the Jacobi matrix attains its maximal value m, f is locally <b>invertible</b> at that point, by the {{implicit}} function theorem.|$|E
5|$|More generally, {{abstract}} algebra makes great use of matrices with {{entries in}} a ring R. Rings are a more general notion than fields in that a division operation need not exist. The very same addition and multiplication operations of matrices extend to this setting, too. The set M(n, R) of all square n-by-n matrices over R is a ring called matrix ring, isomorphic to the endomorphism ring of the left R-module R'n. If the ring R is commutative, that is, its multiplication is commutative, then M(n, R) is a unitary noncommutative (unless n = 1) associative algebra over R. The determinant of square matrices over a commutative ring R can still be defined using the Leibniz formula; such a matrix is <b>invertible</b> {{if and only if}} its determinant is <b>invertible</b> in R, generalising the situation over a field F, where every nonzero element is <b>invertible.</b> Matrices over superrings are called supermatrices.|$|E
5|$|For a block {{cellular}} automaton, testing reversibility is also easy: the automaton is reversible if {{and only}} if the transition function on the blocks of the automaton is <b>invertible,</b> and in this case the reverse automaton has the same block structure with the inverse transition function.|$|E
5|$|The Critters rule is a block {{cellular}} automaton in which, at each step, {{the cells of}} the automaton are partitioned into 2×2 blocks and each block is updated independently of the other blocks. Its transition function flips the state of every cell in a block that does not have exactly two live cells, and in addition rotates by 180° blocks with exactly three live cells. Because this function is <b>invertible,</b> the automaton defined by these rules is a reversible {{cellular automaton}}.|$|E
5|$|The {{determinant}} det(A) or |A| of {{a square}} matrix A {{is a number}} encoding certain properties of the matrix. A matrix is <b>invertible</b> {{if and only if}} its determinant is nonzero. Its absolute value equals the area (in R2) or volume (in R3) of the image of the unit square (or cube), while its sign corresponds to the orientation of the corresponding linear map: the determinant is positive if and only if the orientation is preserved.|$|E
5|$|Several {{methods are}} known for {{defining}} cellular automata rules that are reversible; these include the block cellular automaton method, in which each update partitions the cells into blocks and applies an <b>invertible</b> function separately to each block, and the second-order cellular automaton method, in which the update rule combines states from two previous steps of the automaton. When an automaton is not defined by one of these methods, but is instead given as a rule table, the problem of testing whether it is reversible is solvable for block cellular automata and for one-dimensional cellular automata, but is undecidable for other types of cellular automata.|$|E
5|$|There are no nontrivial {{reversible}} elementary cellular automata. However, a near-miss {{is provided}} by Rule 90 and other elementary cellular automata based on the exclusive or function. In Rule 90, the state of each cell is the exclusive or of the previous states of its two neighbors. This use of the exclusive or makes the transition rule locally <b>invertible,</b> {{in the sense that}} any contiguous subsequence of states can be generated by this rule. Rule 90 is not a reversible cellular automaton rule, because in Rule 90 every assignment of states to the complete array of cells has exactly four possible predecessors, whereas reversible rules are required to have exactly one predecessor per configuration.|$|E
25|$|An element a in E {{is called}} <b>invertible</b> {{if it is}} <b>invertible</b> in C. Power {{associativity}} shows that L(a) and L(a−1) commute. Moreover, a−1 is <b>invertible</b> with inverse a.|$|E
25|$|If g {{is in the}} {{structure}} group and a is <b>invertible,</b> ga is also <b>invertible</b> with (ga)−1 = (g't)−1a−1.|$|E
25|$|This {{yields the}} {{fundamental}} identity for a dense set of <b>invertible</b> elements, so it follows in general by continuity. The fundamental identity implies that c = Q(a)b is <b>invertible</b> if a and b are <b>invertible</b> {{and gives a}} formula for the inverse of Q(c). Applying it to c gives the inverse identity in full generality.|$|E
25|$|An element a in E {{is called}} <b>invertible</b> {{if it is}} <b>invertible</b> in R. If b denotes the inverse, then the {{spectral}} decomposition of a shows that L(a) and L(b) commute.|$|E
25|$|This {{definition}} {{can also}} be extended where K is a commutative ring R, in which case a matrix is <b>invertible</b> {{if and only if}} its determinant is an <b>invertible</b> element in R. For example, a matrix A with entries in Z, the integers, is <b>invertible</b> (in the sense that there exists an inverse matrix with integer entries) if the determinant is +1 or −1. Such a matrix is called unimodular.|$|E
25|$|The {{transforms}} {{are usually}} <b>invertible.</b>|$|E
25|$|Nevertheless, {{it follows}} from this that if Φ is <b>invertible,</b> {{pullback}} {{can be defined}} using pushforward by the inverse function Φ−1. Combining these two constructions yields a pushforward operation, along an <b>invertible</b> linear map, for tensors of any rank (r,s).|$|E
25|$|To {{show that}} the {{positive}} cone C is homogeneous, i.e. has a transitive group of automorphisms, a generalization of the quadratic action of self-adjoint matrices on themselves given by X ↦ YXY has to be defined. If Y is <b>invertible</b> and self-adjoint, this map is <b>invertible</b> and carries positive operators onto positive operators.|$|E
25|$|This shows Thnbsp&minus&nbsp&λ is not bounded below, {{therefore}} not <b>invertible.</b>|$|E
25|$|If a is <b>invertible,</b> Q(a) {{lies in the}} {{structure}} group.|$|E
25|$|Similarly {{any group}} {{can be seen}} as a {{category}} with a single object in which every morphism is <b>invertible,</b> that is, for every morphism f there is a morphism g that is both left and right inverse to f under composition. A morphism that is <b>invertible</b> in this sense is called an isomorphism.|$|E
25|$|A is <b>invertible,</b> i.e. A has an inverse, is nonsingular, or is nondegenerate.|$|E
25|$|A simple fugue {{has only}} one subject, and does not utilize <b>invertible</b> counterpoint.|$|E
25|$|The matrix A is <b>invertible</b> if {{and only}} if every {{eigenvalue}} is nonzero.|$|E
25|$|Thus the {{differential}} is a linear transformation, between tangent spaces, associated to the smooth map φ at each point. Therefore, in some chosen local coordinates, it {{is represented by}} the Jacobian matrix of the corresponding smooth map from Rm to Rn. In general {{the differential}} need not be <b>invertible.</b> If φ is a local diffeomorphism, then the pushforward at x is <b>invertible</b> and its inverse gives the pullback of T'φ(x)N.|$|E
25|$|Every g in Γ(EC) has {{the form}} g = h Q(a) with h an {{automorphism}} and a <b>invertible.</b>|$|E
25|$|A {{coordinate}} map, a coordinate chart, {{or simply}} a chart, of a manifold is an <b>invertible</b> map between {{a subset of the}} manifold and a simple space such that both the map and its inverse preserve the desired structure. For a topological manifold, the simple space is a subset of some Euclidean space Rn and interest focuses on the topological structure. This structure is preserved by homeomorphisms, <b>invertible</b> maps that are continuous in both directions.|$|E
25|$|A matrix is <b>invertible,</b> or non-singular, if {{and only}} if the linear map {{represented}} by the matrix is an isomorphism.|$|E
25|$|The {{transpose}} AT is an <b>invertible</b> matrix (hence rows of A are linearly independent, span Kn, {{and form}} a basis of Kn).|$|E
25|$|Matrix {{inversion}} is {{the process}} of finding the matrix B that satisfies the prior equation for a given <b>invertible</b> matrix A.|$|E
25|$|In general, S is an antihomomorphism, so S2 is a homomorphism, {{which is}} {{therefore}} an automorphism if S was <b>invertible</b> (as may be required).|$|E
25|$|In {{geometric}} algebra, {{they can}} be further generalized to the notions of projection and rejection of a general multivector onto/from any <b>invertible</b> k-blade.|$|E
25|$|If 2 is not <b>invertible,</b> the {{situation}} is somewhat different, and one must use a different polynomial , and obtains a different relation; see Romagny.|$|E
25|$|Note that if F and Q are time {{invariant}} {{these values}} can be cached. Note also that F and Q {{need to be}} <b>invertible.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{condition}} ad − bc ≠ 0 {{is equivalent}} to the condition that the determinant of above matrix be nonzero, i.e. that the matrix be <b>invertible.</b>|$|E
25|$|The {{implicit}} function theorem {{is closely related}} to the inverse function theorem, which states when a function looks like graphs of <b>invertible</b> functions pasted together.|$|E
