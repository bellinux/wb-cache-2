50|$|The <b>Germany-Poland</b> border (Grenze zwischen Deutschland und Polen, Granica polsko-niemiecka), {{the state}} border between Poland and Germany, is {{currently}} the Oder-Neisse line. It has a total length of 467 km {{and has been in}} place since 1945. It stretches from the Baltic Sea in the north to the Czech Republic in the south. Nevertheless, the border has not always followed this line, and it has a long and often volatile history.|$|E

Over several centuries, it has moved eastwards, stabilized in the 14th century, and disappeared in the late 18th century with the partitions of Poland, in which Poland's neighbors, including the Kingdom of Prussia, annexed all of its territory. In 1871 Prussia became part of the German Empire.|$|E
