50|$|Plasticity-induced closure {{results from}} {{compressible}} residual stresses developing {{in the plastic}} wake. This concept which was advanced and generally accepted in the 1970s assumes that a plastically transformed area is formed at the crack tip which leaves a wake of plastically <b>deformed</b> <b>zone</b> along the crack length. This zone has residual compressive stress induced by the elastic and plastic deformation of the material during unloading. During the next cycle, while loading, the crack tip does not open unless the applied load is enough to overcome the residual compressive stress present in the plastic wake zone. Thus the effective stress at the crack tip is lowered.|$|E
50|$|The ball rolls {{across the}} surface of a {{component}} in a pattern defined in the CNC code, as in any machining operation. The tool path and normal pressure applied are designed to create a distribution of compressive residual stress. The form of the distribution is designed to counter applied stresses and optimize fatigue and stress corrosion performance. Since there is no shear being applied to the ball, it is free to roll in any direction. As the ball rolls over the component, the pressure from the ball causes plastic deformation to occur in the surface of the material under the ball. Since the bulk of the material constrains the deformed area, the <b>deformed</b> <b>zone</b> is left in compression after the ball passes.|$|E

50|$|The {{size and}} {{misorientation}} of the <b>deformed</b> <b>zone</b> {{is related to}} the particle size and so there is a minimum particle size required to initiate nucleation. Increasing the extent of deformation will reduce the minimum particle size, leading to a PSN regime in size-deformation space.If the efficiency of PSN is one (i.e. each particle stimulates one nuclei), then the final grain size will be simply determined by the number of particles. Occasionally the efficiency can be greater than one if multiple nuclei form at each particle but this is uncommon. The efficiency will be less than one if the particles are close to the critical size and large fractions of small particles will actually prevent recrystallization rather than initiating it (see above).|$|E
50|$|Amelia Creek crater is {{an impact}} {{structure}} (or astrobleme), the eroded remnant {{of a former}} impact crater, located in the Davenport Range, Northern Territory, Australia. It lies within a low range of Paleoproterozoic sedimentary and volcanic rocks, which are extensively folded and faulted, thus making an eroded impact crater difficult to recognize. It was only discovered by the identification of shatter cones near its centre. The central shatter cone locality {{is surrounded by a}} 20 by 12 km area of anomalous deformation, the asymmetry being possibly related to very oblique impact, but may be at least partly due to the pre-existing structural complexity of the rocks. This <b>deformed</b> <b>zone</b> gives the best estimate for the original size of the crater. Impact took place after folding of the Paleoproterozoic rocks but before deposition of Neoproterozoic and Cambrian rocks which overlie them, thus constraining the impact event to the interval between about 1660 and 600 Ma.|$|E

The change in width of the <b>deformed</b> <b>zone</b> along the collisional belt, with the narrow zone of western Tibet compared to {{the main part of the}} Tibetan Plateau, is explained as either lateral escape to the east along the Altyn Tagh and Karakorum faults in the microplate model or as the effect of the rigid Tarim Basin block causing heterogeneous deformation within a generally weaker lithosphere in the continuum model. The rate of displacement along the major fault zones such as the Altyn Tagh and Kunlun faults compared to the degree of distributed deformation of the intervening crust is critical to discriminating between these two models.|$|E

40|$|SUMMARY. This paper {{presents}} an extended {{version of the}} local lattice deformation model of solid solutions (J. T. Iiyama, I 974 b). It has been assumed previously that a foreign atom fixed in a crystal causes local lattice deformation, which prevents another foreign atom from occupying the <b>deformed</b> <b>zone.</b> The resulting entropy of the solid solution from this model can explain the particular behaviour of ion-exchange r actions observed with alkali and alkali-earth elements in feldspars and in musco-vite. The present version assumes that the <b>deformed</b> <b>zone</b> does not prohibit foreign atoms, but {{that the number of}} foreign atoms acceptable in this region depends on the total numbers of foreign atoms already fixed in the crystal. The model is applied successfully to explain ion-exchange isotherms ob-served with Cs, Na, and Li in micas and permits an estimation of the apparent reaction constant of the ion exchange. This is otherwise impossible {{because of the lack of}} ideal dilute-solution behaviour in exchange isotherms even at the IO ppm range of the foreign element fixed into the crystal. It is demon-strated that the model can explain the particular behaviour of Li in sanidine.

40|$|In the {{compilation}} {{of the conventional}} terrestrial reference frame with modern space geodetic techniques, {{one of the important}} issues is to select those on-plate sites. Considering that whether the motion of a site can be modeled or not by plate rigid motion is not necessarily dependant on the distance from the site to the plate boundary or <b>deforming</b> <b>zones,</b> we propose a statistical selection of on-plate sites. By applying this selection method on a VLBI global solution, the followings are shown. (1) The statistically selected on-plate sites are more than and in consistency globally with the VLBI primary sites of the International Terrestrial Reference Frame 2000 (ITRF 2000). (2) The statistical selection emphasizes the consistency between the site motion and the plate rigid motion but ignores the distance from the site to the plate boundaries or <b>deforming</b> <b>zones.</b> (3) Some of the statistically selected on-plate sites are not primaries in ITRF 2000. However, by including these sites the estimations of plate rigid motion are not changed significantly. Instead, the precision of estimated parameters is increased due to the improvement in the site geometric distribution. (4) Details of our analysis show that RICHMOND can be taken as a on-plate site, but it is not in the list of those most firmly on-plate. This site is usually used as one of the velocity constraint sites in VLBI global analysis. We recommend using ALGOPARK, FD-VLBA or NRAO 140 as substitutes. 1...|$|R

40|$|The {{width of}} diffuse oceanic plate {{boundaries}} {{is determined by}} the rheology of oceanic lithosphere. Here we apply thin viscous sheet models, which have been successfully applied to deformation in several continental <b>deforming</b> <b>zones,</b> to investigate the deformation of oceanic lithosphere in the diffuse oceanic plate boundaries between the India, Capricorn, and Australia Plates. We apply kinematic boundary conditions based on the current motion between these plates. We neglect buoyancy forces due to plate thinning or thickening and assume that the thin viscous sheet has the same depth-integrated nonlinear viscosity coefficient everywhere. Our initial models have only one adjustable parameter, n, the power-law exponent, with n[*]=[*] 1, 3, 10, 30, and 100. The predicted width of the <b>deforming</b> <b>zone</b> decreases with increasing n, with n[*]‚â•[*] 30 explaining the observations.

SAFOD samples provide a transect across undeformed host rock, the fault damage zone and currently active <b>deforming</b> <b>zones</b> of the San Andreas Fault. TCDP samples are retrieved from the principal slip zone (PSZ) and from the surrounding damage zone of the Chelungpu Fault. Substantial differences exist in the clay mineralogy of SAFOD and TCDP fault gouge samples. Amorphous material has been observed in SAFOD as well as TCDP samples. In line with previous publications, we propose that melt, observed in TCDP black gouge samples, was produced by seismic slip (melt origin) whereas amorphous material in SAFOD samples was formed by comminution of grains (crush origin) rather than by melting. Dauphin√© twins in quartz grains of SAFOD and TCDP samples may indicate high seismic stress. The differences in the crystallographic preferred orientation of calcite between SAFOD and TCDP samples are significant. Microstructures resulting from dissolution-precipitation processes were observed in both faults but are more frequently found in SAFOD samples than in TCDP fault rocks. As already described for many other fault zones clay-gouge fabrics are quite weak in SAFOD and TCDP samples.
