40|$|The goal of {{this thesis}} is to analyze the {{sovereignty}} dispute between Argentina and Great Britain over the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> (<b>Malvinas).</b> It is focused mainly on the Argentinean perspective of the conflict. After explaining {{the background of the}} dispute the thesis examines the time period between the year 1982, when the Falklands war occurred and nowadays situation. In this period the thesis analyzes the impact of the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> (<b>Malvinas)</b> on the Argentinean foreign and domestic policy. The key point for understanding Argentinean attitude to the dispute is to name the factors, which sustain persistent effort of the Argentinean political elite to reaffirm the sovereignty over the islands...|$|E
40|$|Magellanic {{penguins}} (Spheniscus mageüanicus) {{are only}} found around southern South América, with breeding populations in Chile, Argentina and the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> (<b>Malvinas).</b> One ot Chile's {{largest and most}} important Magellanic penguin breeding sites is situated on Magdalena Island in the Straits ot Magellan. The island has been designated a national nature reserve because ot its importance as a penguin breeding site, and the reserve is managed by the government agency Corporación Nacional Forestal. The island is a popular tourist destination, and Magellanic penguins are increasingly exposed to human activities. In order to protect this seabird and to ensure the sustainable use of the reserve as a tourist resource, Magdalena Island {{has been part of}} a long-term monitoring programme since 1998. This programme does annual census, monitors annual changes in population, breeding success, chick and egg survival rates, and quantifies the effects on human visitation on the behaviour and breeding of penguins.

40|$|This paper {{presents}} a world map of organic agriculture. A Gall-Peters projection {{map of the}} world is taken as the reference map (where map areas are proportional to territorial areas). Applying the area of organic agriculture to countries, the World Map of Organic Agriculture presents countries as proportional in size to their share of the total of world organic hectares (such a map can be referred to as an equal-area cartogram or a densityequalising map). The World Map of Organic Agriculture accounts for 37. 2 million hectares of organically managed agricultural land (certified organic and in-conversion organic) from 160 countries, and here distributed across the 200 territories of the reference map. The World Map of Organic Agriculture visually reveals global contiguity and regional relationships among and between the territories of the world, and highlights the regional strengths and weaknesses of the global diffusion of organic agriculture. The World Map of Organic Agriculture is generated by the Worldmapper GIS algorithm developed at the University of Sheffield as a cartographic visualisation tool. It is the first Worldmapper cartogram to proportionately represent <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> (<b>Malvinas)</b> ...|$|E
40|$|Understanding {{the causes}} of {{population}} decline is crucial for conservation management. We therefore used genetic analysis both to provide baseline data on population structure and to evaluate hypotheses for the catastrophic decline of the South American sea lion (Otaria flavescens) at the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> (<b>Malvinas)</b> in the South Atlantic. We genotyped 259 animals from 23 colonies across the Falklands at 281  bp of the mitochondrial hypervariable region and 22 microsatellites. A weak signature of population structure was detected, genetic diversity was moderately high in comparison with other pinniped species, and no evidence was found for the decline being associated with a strong demographic bottleneck. By combining our mitochondrial data with published sequences from Argentina, Brazil, Chile and Peru, we also uncovered strong maternally directed population structure across the geographical range of the species. In particular, very few shared haplotypes {{were found between the}} Falklands and South America, and this was reflected in correspondingly low migration rate estimates. These findings do not support the prominent hypothesis that the decline was caused by migration to Argentina, where large-scale commercial harvesting operations claimed over half a million animals. Thus, our study not only provides baseline data for conservation management but also reveals the potential for genetic studies to shed light upon long-standing questions pertaining to the history and fate of natural populations...|$|E
40|$|Organic {{agriculture}} {{is now a}} worldwide phenomenon which is practiced in 160 countries. The Organics Olympiad presents 12 indices of global organics leadership, each at three levels. It yields 26 countries as global organics leaders, and reveals that organics leadership is diversely distributed across countries, large and small, rich and poor, developed and less so, as well as across linguistic and cultural barriers. Australia leads the world in organic agriculture hectares, Finland leads in organic wild culture hectares, China leads in organic aquaculture hectares, and Portugal leads in organic forest hectares. Germany leads in biodynamic hectares, {{as well as with}} the number of members of the International Federation of Agriculture Movements (IFOAM), and in the publishing of organics research papers. India is in the lead position for the number of organic producers, the <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> (<b>Malvinas)</b> leads in terms of the percentage of agricultural land dedicated as organic, and Denmark leads with the value of organics consumption per capita. Uruguay leads in the relative increase in organic hectares over the past decade, and Japan leads in the number of organics certifiers. The overall global organics leaders, on the basis of aggregated scores, are Germany, India and Denmark, in positions one, two and three, respectively. The successful global diffusion of organics, as demonstrated in this study, means that leadership lessons are available from a diversity of social, geographical, political, and ecological situations for both existing and aspiring organics leaders.

40|$|Illex argentinus, the Argentine short-finned squid, is an {{important}} species within the Patagonian shelf ecosystem, where it supports a major multi-national fishery. The fishing fleet operating in this region is comprised of jigging vessels which attract squid using powerful incandescent lights. These fishing lights are detectable in remotely sensed satellite imagery which makes the fishery unusually amenable to a large-scale analysis of its spatial dynamics. In this paper, long-term inter-annual variability in fleet distribution and extent is examined using imagery from the Defence Meteorological Satellite Program-Operational Linescan System (DMSP-OLS) for the period 1993 – 2005. The fishery was found to occupy a wide area across the shelf and slope, with regions of consistent fishing activity observed {{on the high seas}} (45 – 47 °S) and {{to the north of the}} <b>Falkland</b> <b>Islands</b> (<b>Malvinas).</b> Distribution of the fishery over the 13 -year study period was variable, with 28 % of the fished area occupied in 1 – 2 years, and 7 % of the area occupied in 12 – 13 years. Annual catch levels were positively associated with the extent of the area occupied by the fleet. Higher catches corresponded to the fishery occupying a wide latitudinal range, whereas lower catches were observed during 2004 and 2005 corresponding to a contraction of the fishery away from the south of its range. In years of very high catches, fishing took place along almost the entire latitudinal range of the species. Due to the intensity of fishing, changes in the distribution of the fleet can reflect shifts in the distribution of I. argentinus; this has potential for the long-term monitoring of this highly variable squid fishery...|$|E
