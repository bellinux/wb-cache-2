25|$|In 1998, the Scottish Football Association invited Drummond {{to write}} and record a theme song for the Scotland {{national}} football team's 1998 FIFA World Cup campaign. Drummond decided against doing it (Del Amitri got the job) but <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had twisted fate by declining, because the other major football songs of that year were made by associates of his: Keith Allen ("Vindaloo") and Ian Broudie ("Three Lions"), two men he had met {{on the same day}} when working on Illuminatus! in 1976, and former protege Ian McCulloch.|$|E
500|$|While {{serving as}} a colonel, Jackson {{considered}} resigning his commission. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had missed his chance for promotion to brigadier {{at the age of}} 44, and believed he might have [...] "reached [...] ceiling" [...] as it was unusual for older officers to be selected for promotion. He was persuaded to try again the next year and was promoted to brigadier on 31 December 1989, after spending six months on a Service Fellowship writing a paper {{on the future of the}} Army and taking the Higher Command and Staff Course. He went on to serve his third tour in Northern Ireland, commanding 39 Infantry Brigade—a post he held until 1992, thus missing the Gulf War. He was promoted from Member to Commander of the Order of the British Empire (CBE) in 1992.|$|E
500|$|Peter Brown {{wrote in}} his memoir, The Love You Make: An Insider's Story of the Beatles, that he had once found a suicide note written by Epstein and had spoken with him about it. According to Brown the note read in part, [...] "This is all too much and I can't take it any more". Brown had also found a will in which Epstein left his house and money {{to his mother and}} his brother, with Brown also being named as a minor beneficiary. When confronted with the notes, Epstein told Brown that he would be {{grateful}} if Brown did not tell anyone, and was sorry he had made Brown worry. He explained that when he wrote the note and composed the will he had simply taken one pill too many, and that {{he had no intention of}} overdosing, promising to be more careful in the future. Brown later wrote that <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> had done the right thing by not showing the note to Epstein's doctor, Norman Cowan, who would have stopped prescribing drugs. The coroner, Gavin Thurston, told the Westminster inquest that Epstein's death was caused by an overdose of Carbitral, and ruled it as an accidental death. The pathologist, Dr. Donald Teare, stated that Epstein had been taking bromide in the form of Carbitral for some time, and that the barbiturate level in Epstein's blood was a [...] "low fatal level".|$|E
50|$|The {{situation}} {{he was in}} {{brought him}} to fear for his life. In early 1985 he was threatened of being killed; {{in many of the}} letters he wrote to his family in that year <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> will ever see them again.|$|R

After Luke leaves he meets Jenny in a lane and asks her to love him, but she runs off; <b>he</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> should be brutal, {{like the way the}} Mumby sons ill-treat their horses.|$|R
2500|$|Campbell was {{struggling}} {{to set up a}} practical demonstration over a real telephone route with the budget he had been allocated. [...] After considering that his artificial line simulators used lumped components rather than the distributed quantities found in a real line, <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could not insert the inductance with lumped components instead of using Stone's distributed line. [...] When his calculations showed that the manholes on telephone routes were sufficiently close together to be able to insert the loading coils without the expense of either having to dig up the route or lay in new cables he changed to this new plan. [...] The very first demonstration of loading coils on a telephone cable was on a 46-mile length of the so-called Pittsburgh cable (the test was actually in Boston, the cable had previously been used for testing in Pittsburgh) on 6 September 1899 carried out by Campbell himself and his assistant. [...] The first telephone cable using loaded lines put into public service was between Jamaica Plain and West Newton in Boston on 18 May 1900.|$|E

5000|$|At {{the end of}} the chapter, Tillyard says that, {{although}} personality {{counts for}} little in a poet like Tennyson, personality has two functions in literature—(1) to allow the reader to share with the author and (2) to serve as an example to the reader. <b>He</b> <b>wonders</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> and Lewis can resolve their dispute into a matter of terminology, especially a different definition of the word [...] "personality." ...|$|R

60|$|Well, {{there was}} only one thing for him to do. He must meet her on her own basis of boyhood, and not make the mistake of {{treating}} her as a woman. <b>He</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could love the woman she would be when her nature awoke; and <b>he</b> <b>wondered</b> <b>if</b> <b>he</b> could love her just as she was and himself wake her up. After all, whatever it was, she had come to fill quite a large place in his life, as he had discovered that afternoon while scanning the sea between the squalls. Then he remembered the accounts of Berande, and the cropper that was coming, and scowled.|$|E

However, Jarlaxle and Athrogate discover it first.
