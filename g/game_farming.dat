After graduation, he joined the staff of Interstate National Bank in Kansas City but soon returned to the South Plains in 1948 {{to work at the}} Pitchfork. He was hired by manager Douglas Burns (1895-1977) as the assistant in charge of hog operations. He soon mastered ranch operations and became the sixth manager of the Pitchfork when Burns retired to Lubbock but continued to advise the ranch as a director of the parent company. On June 9, 1951, he wed the former Berneice Anderson in Creighton, Missouri. [...] As ranch manager, Humphreys supervised the operation of some 165000 acre and 113 windmills in King and adjacent Dickens counties.

The signature [...] "Pitchfork Gray" [...] -- a gray horse with a black mane and tail—is synonymous with the ranch. The Pitchfork maintains a satellite operation in Jefferson County in southern Oklahoma. The previous Flint Hills Ranch near Eskridge in Wabaunsee County in northeastern Kansas, and the Flag Ranch in Wyoming have been sold.

40|$|The {{analysis}} of <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> {{is set in}} the Eastern Cape, South Africa. <b>Game</b> <b>farming</b> reorders the use, meaning and value of land and animal species. However, what it means for rural development processes in the immediate region and beyond is not well accounted for. We perceive <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> as an assemblage that brings together new actors, new forms of land use and new discourses. We argue that although <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> has generated new opportunities and new forms of added value to the available resources (e. g. eco-tourism, trophy hunting, game-meat production), situated in the history and contemporary context of the Eastern Cape, it is a contested, and from a development point of view, problematic land-use practice. We argue that <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> constrains land and agrarian reforms: the distribution of land and income remains skewed; ‘poaching’ occurs and game farms do not, or only minimally, generate new and badly needed employment opportunities. The game farm has emerged as an exclusive, globally well-connected space. The nature of the relationships this space maintains with the surrounding communities is, however, such that the overall contribution to rural development in South Africa is questionable. </p...|$|E
40|$|This thesis {{sets out}} to {{investigate}} the socio-economic consequences or implications on the township people in Cradock (a town located in iNxuba Yethemba Municipality, Eastern Cape Province of South Africa) of the recent conversions from commercial agriculture to private <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> (PGF). The study draws primarily on research conducted in the town, the history of which {{is rooted in the}} development and expansion of commercial agriculture {{that took place in the}} early 1800 s. It is specifically concerned with the effects of the conversion of agricultural land to <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> on the socio-economic conditions of black African and coloured township people, who have directly or indirectly depended on commercial agricultural production for many decades past. These people have, over the last 200 years, benefited from commercial agriculture through employment, material resource supplies and off-farm activities. These three kinds of socio-economic mechanisms played a crucial role in sustaining the socio-economic conditions of the Eastern Cape's semi-arid towns, such as Cradock, in particular, of those citizens who reside in the townships. By using the de-agrarianisation thesis as a theoretical framework, the study argues that the agrarian change in the form of conversion towards private <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> industry is a form of the de-agrarianisation process, not the proliferation of off-farm activities or off-farm employment, as postulated by Bryceson and Jamal (1997). The study addresses the current debate about the implications of agrarian change emerging in the semi-arid area of the Eastern Cape and in South Africa. At an empirical level, the study seeks to test the proponents of private <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> who argue that <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> in formerly agrarian areas generates national revenue and provides multiple socio-economic benefits to the poor and marginalised people. Part of the context in which the discussion in this study takes place is the role that the development of agricultural land aims to play in improving the socio-economic status or The study uses the economic history of agrarian economy in the Karoo and its production in relation to black Africans as an approach to analyse the effects of conversion. It critically examines the dynamics related to the contribution of private <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> in Cradock, an area historically known as an agricultural stronghold. The study thus argues that the recent introduction of private <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> in the formerly agrarian areas has established an elitist economy that is virtually inaccessible to the people of the area, especially the poor and previously marginalised people residing in the townships of Cradock. The study uses qualitative research design and various qualitative data collection methods such as interviews, household interviews, focus group interviews and qualitative observation, to unpack the socio-economic implications of conversions from the perspective of the township residents. The findings of the study indicate that while the introduction of private <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> industry in Cradock has generated employment for some township people, the industry has negatively affected the socio-economic livelihoods of these people. Although they receive a wage higher than what they received in the former commercial agriculture, the study reveals that their livelihoods are severely and negatively affected by the conversion, as they now have restrained access to the material resource supplies they used to access when the land was used for commercial agriculture. This, in turn, has resulted into the decline of off-farm activities such as butcheries, informal trades, and the trade in and selling of agricultural implements that were an integral part of the former agrarian economy of the town...|$|E

40|$|This {{thesis is}} an {{investigation}} of the impact of commercial <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> on former farm workers in the Bushman's River area of the Eastern Cape. In its examination of the broader economic and political changes that have facilitated a move from agriculture to <b>game</b> <b>farming,</b> it analyses how these changes affect farm workers. The main concern of the thesis is the ways in which farm workers (at the local level) respond to changes at the national and global level (legal and political changes, the advent of tourism, and the injection of foreign capital and businessmen into the area). Lack of knowledge about their rights under the current political dispensation, as well as the perceived need for mediation between themselves and foreign landowners, points to a general sense of powerlessness. Feelings of alienation from local government structures aimed at fulfilling this function indicate a significant gap between the statute at the national level and the local reality. Local reality is informed by a strong conservatism which is generated by African Independent Church structures and local Xhosa perceptions of manhood and respectability. This conservative discourse leads to a frame of reference which is largely informed by pre- 1994 interactions with farmers and government. This results in a situation in which farm workers, largely unaware of their rights in the new dispensation, operate {{as they did in the}} past; waiting for landowners to decide their fate for them. What ensues is a lack of meaningful interaction with government and landowners, perpetuating their subjugation and cynicism as to whether government structures are in fact working in their interests. The thesis comes to three main conclusions. The first is that <b>game</b> <b>farming</b> has been negatively received by farm workers due to the associated threats of unemployment and eviction. The second is that despite high levels of subjugation, even the very poor are agents to some degree. The creation of a masculine identity which is internally articulated, as opposed to outwardly expressed, and the grounding of reputation in the family suggest that farm workers have developed mechanisms to deal with their disempowered position. Lastly, farm workers are in possession of social capital which has made it possible for them to deal with their low status in the societal hierarchy. This includes the Church, family and fellow community members. These coping strategies have however proved a disadvantage in the current era because they prevent direct communication with landowners, government and NGOs...|$|E
