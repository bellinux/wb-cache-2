5|$|Agârbiceanu {{spent his}} last <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half under a {{communist}} regime that outlawed his church, an act {{in which he}} refused to cooperate. Much of his work, with its transparent Christian moralizing, proved incompatible with the new ideology, and was banned by communist censors; however, the regime found him useful for its image, and bestowed honors upon him. Agârbiceanu's full contribution has been made available since the 1990s, but he endures as a largely forgotten author, {{with the possible exception}} of his Apuseni-based novella, Fefeleaga.|$|E
5|$|Despite Cimon's massive victory, {{something}} of a stalemate developed between Persia and the League. The Greeks {{do not appear to}} have pressed their advantage home in a meaningful way. If the later date of 466 BC for the Eurymedon campaign is accepted, this might be because the revolt in Thasos meant that resources were diverted away from Asia Minor to prevent the Thasians seceding from the League. Conversely, as Plutarch suggests, the Persians adopted a very defensive strategy in the Aegean for the next <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half. The Persian fleet was effectively absent from the Aegean until 451 BC, and Greek ships were able to ply the coasts of Asia Minor with impunity. The next major Delian League campaign against the Persian would only occur in 460 BC, when the Athenians decided to support a revolt in the Egyptian satrapy of the Persian empire. This campaign would last 6 years, before eventually ending in disaster for the Greeks.|$|E
5|$|The Sprain Brook {{was first}} {{proposed}} in the early 1920s as a parkway between the Bronx River Parkway and the Hawthorne Circle. The parkway sold a majority of its right-of-way in the 1920s, but the proposed parkway met strong opposition {{from the village of}} Bronxville and Yonkers. The Sprain Brook proposal sat on the table until 1949, when the State Council of Parks, run by Robert Moses, sought to ease congestion on the Bronx River Parkway. Moses proposed that a new state park would be constructed in Westchester, with the Sprain Brook Parkway serving as a traffic alternative to the Bronx River, and nearly a <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half after the parkway was deeded land. This time, Bronxville opposed the project rather than Yonkers, but an agreement was worked out in 1951. This new alignment would bypass the parts of Bronxville and Yonkers to construct the freeway.|$|E

5|$|Chahi {{acquired}} {{the rights to}} Another Worlds intellectual property from Delphine Software International after they closed down in July 2004. Magic Productions then offered to port the game to mobile phones, and it was ported with help from Cyril Cogordan. Chahi saw that the game's playability could be improved, so he used his old Amiga for reprogramming {{certain parts of the}} script and made the graphics' shading clearer in order to counter mobile phones' low resolutions. In July 2005, almost a <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half after it was first released on the Amiga, the game was released for mobile phone handsets using the Symbian operating system, thanks to Telcogames and developer Magic Productions. In 2006, Magic Productions also released a remastered Pocket PC version for Windows Mobile 5.0 OS or later in QVGA (320×240 resolution). Telcogames entered administration in 2008, closing the Magic Productions studio. The administrator's letter to stakeholders mentions that its assets will be sold, but does not indicate to whom or mention Another World assets by name.|$|E
5|$|Each {{episode of}} Degrassi is written {{following}} the same formula {{with two or three}} storylines (Plot A, Plot B and Plot C). The main storyline, A, opens and closes the episode and is usually driven by a single character. Plot B is usually more comedic in tone and sometimes slightly intertwined with the other stories, often moving story arcs forward. Plot C was usually used sporadically in a season-long arc, but is now used in every episode as comedic relief. The problems and issues presented in the episode are not always resolved {{by the end of the}} episode, and are carried over to the next, or create a mini-arc over several episodes. The majority of episodes are named after songs from the 1980s, and since the tenth season, episodes are named after songs from the 1990s to the present, representing the entering of a new <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> completely different cast from the earlier seasons. For the first nine seasons, Degrassi: The Next Generation had been produced as a weekly half-hour teen comedy-drama series, with each season consisting of between fifteen and twenty-four episodes.|$|E
5|$|It {{had taken}} a <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, from 1961 to 1976, for the {{production}} cost of the average Hollywood feature to double from $2 million to $4 million—a decline if adjusted for inflation. In just four years it more than doubled again, hitting $8.5 million in 1980 (a constant-dollar increase of about 25 percent). Even as the U.S. inflation rate eased, the average expense of moviemaking would continue to soar. With the majors now routinely saturation booking in over a thousand theaters, it was becoming increasingly difficult for smaller outfits to secure the exhibition commitments needed to turn a profit. Double features were now literally history—almost impossible to find except at revival houses. One of the first leading casualties of the new economic regime was venerable B studio Allied Artists, which declared bankruptcy in April 1979. In the late 1970s, AIP had turned to producing relatively expensive films like the very successful Amityville Horror and the disastrous Meteor in 1979. The studio was sold off and dissolved as a moviemaking concern {{by the end of}} 1980.|$|E

5|$|The nearly <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half of wars greatly {{weakened}} the Spanish American economies and political institutions, which hindered the region's potential economic development {{for most of}} the nineteenth century and resulted in the enduring instability the region experienced. Independence destroyed the de facto trade bloc that was the Spanish Empire - Manila galleons and Spanish treasure fleets in particular. After independence, trade among the new Spanish American nations was less {{than it had been in}} the colonial period. Once the ties were broken, the small populations of most of the new nations provided little incentive to entice Spanish American producers to recreate the old trade patterns. In addition, the protection against European competition, which the Spanish monopoly had provided to the manufacturing sectors of the economy, ended. Due to expediency, protective tariffs for these sectors, in particular textile production, were permanently dropped and foreign imports beat out local production. This greatly affected Native communities, which in many parts of Spanish America, specialized in supplying finished products to the urban markets, albeit using pre-industrial techniques. The wars also greatly affected the principal economic sector of the region, mining. Silver production in Bolivia halved after independence and it dropped by three quarters in Mexico.|$|E

25|$|The station opened as Høibråten on 20 October 1921, {{following}} {{the establishment of}} a residential area the previous <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half.

25|$|His {{immediate}} successor, {{according to}} the bishop list of Walter Bower, was Giric; but the next consecrated bishop we know about from other sources is Turgot. The obvious question is, did the bishopric really lie vacant for a <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, did Bower or his source invent Giric, or did Giric actually succeed? The former options hardly seem probable in the context.|$|E

The ECSA endured much in-fighting over the next <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half, leading to its official demise in 1978. The WCSA continues today as the American Association for Nude Recreation– Western Canadian Region (www.aanr-wc.com), a region of the American Association for Nude Recreation (AANR) which itself was {{formerly known as the}} ASA.|$|E
25|$|Malmö {{was one of}} {{the most}} {{successful}} sporting cities in Sweden during the 1940s and 1950s; its clubs won national championships in several sports. Malmö FF won their first football championship at Malmö IP during the 1943–44 Allsvenskan season, and over the next <b>decade</b> <b>and</b> <b>a</b> half added another four league titles and five Svenska Cupen (Swedish Cup) wins. MAI, wrestling clubs Sparta and Enighet, IFK Malmö's handball division and others also won Swedish championships during this time. Several major European football clubs visited Malmö IP in the years following the Second World War to play friendlies against Malmö FF; these included A.C. Milan of Italy and Wolverhampton Wanderers, Birmingham City and Charlton Athletic from England. These matches caused new attendance records to be set several times.|$|E
