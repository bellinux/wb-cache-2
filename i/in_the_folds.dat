5|$|The panels contain {{quotations}} in Latin {{from several}} biblical texts. They appear either as lettering seemingly sewn into {{the edges of}} the figures' clothes (mostly hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds),</b> or directly {{on the surface of the}} central inner panel. The latter occur in four instances; two pairs of text float on either side of Christ, two around Michael. Beneath the lily, in white paint are the words of Christ: VENITE BENEDICTI PATRIS MEI POSSIDETE PARATUM VOBIS REGNUM A CONSTITUTIONE MUNDI ("Come ye blessed of my father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundations of the world"). The text beneath the sword reads: DISCEDITE A ME MALEDICTI IN IGNEM ÆTERNUM QUI PARATUS EST DIABOLO ET ANGELIS EJUS ("Depart from me ye cursed, into everlasting fire, prepared for the devil and his angels").|$|E
5|$|A statue by {{sculptor}} Daniel Chester French called Alma Mater {{is centered}} {{on the front steps}} of Low Memorial Library. McKim, Mead & White invited French to build the sculpture in order to harmonize with the larger composition of the court and library {{in the center of the}} campus. Draped in an academic gown, the female figure of Alma Mater wears a crown of laurels and sits on a throne. The scroll-like arms of the throne end in lamps, representing sapientia and doctrina. A book signifying knowledge, balances on her lap, and an owl, the attribute of wisdom, is hidden <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> of her gown. Her right hand holds a scepter composed of four sprays of wheat, terminating with a crown of King's College which refers to Columbia's origin as a Royalist institution in 1754. A local actress named Mary Lawton was said to have posed for parts of the sculpture. The statue was dedicated on September 23, 1903, as a gift of Mr. & Mrs. Robert Goelet, and was originally covered in golden leaf. During the Columbia University protests of 1968 a bomb damaged the sculpture, but it has since been repaired. The small hidden owl on the sculpture is also the subject of many Columbia legends, the main legend being that the first student in the freshmen class to find the hidden owl on the statue will be valedictorian, and that any subsequent Columbia male who finds it will marry a Barnard student, given that Barnard is a women's college.|$|E

Most active at night, they hunt for other spiders.

25|$|The {{human brain}} {{is not fully}} {{developed}} {{by the time a}} person reaches puberty. Between the ages of 10 and 25, the brain undergoes changes that have important implications for behavior (see Cognitive development below). The brain reaches 90% of its adult size by the time a person is six years of age. Thus, the brain does not grow in size much during adolescence. However, the creases in the brain continue to become more complex until the late teens. The biggest changes <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> of the brain during this time occur in the parts of the cortex that process cognitive and emotional information.|$|E
50|$|The {{length of}} the {{forewings}} is 2.5-2.7 mm. The forewings are cream tinged with ochreous below <b>the</b> <b>fold</b> from <b>the</b> base to three-fifths.

There is also light ochreous to brown at the termen, as a spot submedially, and below the costa as a broken line, and <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>fold.</b> <b>The</b> hindwings are blackish brown, becoming paler greyish brown on the distal one-third.|$|R

25|$|Virilization {{of genetically}} female (XX) infants usually {{produces}} obvious genital ambiguity. Inside the pelvis, the ovaries are normal {{and since they}} have not been exposed to testicular antimullerian hormone (MIF), the uterus, fallopian tubes, upper vagina, and other mullerian structures are normally formed as well. However, the high levels of testosterone in the blood can enlarge the phallus, partially or completely close the vaginal opening, enclose the urethral groove so that it opens {{at the base of the}} phallus, on the shaft or even at the tip like a boy. Testosterone can cause the labial skin to become as thin and rugated as a scrotum, but cannot produce palpable gonads (i.e., testes) <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds.</b>|$|E
25|$|All five {{versions}} of the picture are of roughly the same large size (2.6 x 2.2 m). Bonaparte appears mounted in the uniform of a general in chief, wearing a gold-trimmed bicorne, and armed with a Mamluk-style sabre. He is wreathed <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> of a large cloak which billows in the wind. His head is turned towards the viewer, and he gestures {{with his right hand}} toward the mountain summit. His left hand grips the reins of his steed. The horse rears up on its back legs, its mane and tail whipped against its body by the same wind that inflates Napoleon's cloak. In background a line of the soldiers interspersed with artillery make their way up the mountain. Dark clouds hang over the picture and in front of Bonaparte the mountains rise up sharply. In the foreground BONAPARTE, HANNIBAL and KAROLVS MAGNVS IMP. are engraved on rocks. On the breastplate yoke of the horse, the picture is signed and dated.|$|E
25|$|Columbanus did {{not lead}} a perfect life. According to Jonas and other sources, he could be impetuous and even headstrong, for by nature he was eager, passionate, and dauntless. These qualities were both {{the source of his}} power and the cause of his mistakes. His virtues, however, were quite remarkable. Like many saints, he had a great love for God's creatures. Stories claim that as he walked in the woods, it was not {{uncommon}} for birds to land on his shoulders to be caressed, or for squirrels to run down from the trees and nestle <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> of his cowl. Although a strong defender of Irish traditions, he never wavered in showing deep respect for the Holy See as the supreme authority. His influence in Europe was due to the conversions he effected and to the rule that he composed. It may be that the example and success of Saint Columba in Caledonia inspired him to similar exertions. The life of Columbanus stands as the prototype of missionary activity in Europe, followed by such men as Saint Kilian, Vergilius of Salzburg, Donatus of Fiesole, Wilfrid, Willibrord, Suitbert of Kaiserwerdt, Saint Boniface, and Ursicinus of Saint-Ursanne.|$|E

500|$|Although {{it seems}} clear from {{the style of the}} script that the text was written at Monkwearmouth–Jarrow, it is {{possible}} that the binding was then added at Lindisfarne; the form of the plant scrolls can be compared to those on the portable altar also found in Cuthbert's coffin, presumed to have been made there, though also to other works of the period, such as the shaft of an Anglo-Saxon cross from Penrith and the Vespasian Psalter.

500|$|Male Lepidoptera possess special scales, called androconia (singular – androconium), {{which have}} evolved {{as a result}} of sexual {{selection}} for the purposes of disseminating pheromones for attracting suitable mates. Androconia may be dispersed on the wings, body, or legs or occur in patches, referred to as [...] "brands", [...] "sex brands" [...] or [...] "stigmata" [...] on the wings, usually in invaginations of the upper surface of the forewings, sometimes concealed by other scales. Androconia are also known to occur <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> of wings. These brands sometimes consist of hairlike tufts which facilitate the diffusion of the pheromone. The role of androconia in the courtship of pierid and nymphalid butterflies, such as Pyronia tithonus, has been proven experimentally.|$|E

500|$|After Ivan Vladislav's {{death in}} February 1018, Diogenes {{was charged with}} mopping up the last {{remaining}} centres of Bulgarian resistance. He took Sirmium and was named its commander (archon); his authority extended over the vassal Serbian statelets of Raška. His title was possibly that of [...] "strategos of Serbia" [...] (Greek: στρατηγός Σερβίας), which is attested in a seal attributed to him. Diogenes was ordered by Basil II to subdue Sermon, the ruler of Sirmium, to consolidate Byzantine control of the northern Balkans. Consequently, Diogenes invited Sermon to {{a meeting at the}} estuary of the river Sava in the Danube, where each would only be accompanied by three attendants. Diogenes had hidden his sword <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> of his clothes, and struck Sermon down. He then marched his army into Sirmium, taking possession of the town.

2500|$|The altarpiece {{is unusual}} {{because of the}} degree to which Memling copied and {{repeated}} the composition's elements in other paintings.

2500|$|The Aquila was {{the eagle}} {{standard}} of a Roman legion, carried {{by a special}} grade legionary known as an Aquilifer. One eagle standard was carried by each legion. Pliny the Elder (H.N. x.16) enumerates five animals displayed on [...] Roman military ensigns: the eagle, the wolf, the minotaur, the horse, and the boar. In the second consulship of Gaius Marius (104 BC) the four quadrupeds were laid aside as standards, the eagle being alone retained. It was made of silver, or bronze, with outstretched wings, but was probably of a relatively small size, since a standard-bearer (signifer) under Julius Caesar is said in circumstances of danger to have wrenched the eagle from its staff and concealed it <b>in</b> <b>the</b> <b>folds</b> of his girdle.|$|E
