25|$|Constant {{mass flow}} {{addition}} valves {{are used to}} supply a constant mass flow of fresh gas to an active type semi-closed rebreather to replenish the gas used by the diver and to maintain an approximately constant composition of the loop mix. Two main types are used: the <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice</b> and the adjustable orifice (usually a needle valve). The constant mass flow valve is usually based on a gas regulator that is isolated from the ambient pressure so that it provides an absolute pressure regulated output (not compensated for ambient pressure). This limits the depth range in which constant mass flow is possible through the orifice, but provides a relatively predictable gas mixture in the breathing loop. An over-pressure relief valve {{in the first stage}} is used to protect the output hose. Unlike most other diving regulators, these do not control the downstream pressure, but they do regulate the flow rate.|$|E

50|$|The {{needle valve}} may be located {{proximal}} or distal to the inlet port; {{these two types}} of flowmeter are respectively called 'non-compensated' or 'compensated'. The original Thorpe tube flowmeter is the non-compensated type: it works with a <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice</b> and variable pressure. The non-compensated type is more accurate for low flow rates, such as are used in neonatal units, laboratory experiments, or anaesthetic machines. Compensated flowmeters work with a variable orifice and fixed pressure. They read back pressure, and take into account resistance changes downstream from the needle valve. If pressure exceeds 50 psig downstream, flow ceases.|$|E

40|$|Copper {{corrosion}} {{has been}} observed in process water (PW) systems at the Advanced Photon Source (APS) dating to the early postcommissioning phase of the project. In time, copper corrosion products agglomerated significantly in certain preferred locations. Significant agglomerations (or deposits) can occur in copper cooling passages such as magnet conductors and x-ray absorbers having relatively large length-to-diameter ratios and where heat is removed by water cooling. Such agglomerations also occur at restrictions found in noncopper system components such as valve seats, <b>fixed</b> <b>orifices,</b> pump seal faces, etc. Modifications to the APS process water system that significantly reduce the rate of copper corrosion are discussed. These modifications have not prevented corrosion altogether. Other means used to prevent component clogging and malfunction {{as a result of}} current copper corrosion rates are listed...|$|R
40|$|Suspension {{systems are}} used to {{diminish}} the vibration of vehicles. The hydraulic dampers in conventional suspension systems are mainly designed with the orifices of the piston; however, the vibration energy will be transferred into waste heat. In recent years, conventional vehicles with internal combustion engines and hybrid vehicles are used commonly. However, with the gradual depletion of fossil fuels, electric vehicles are developing. For this reason, the research focuses on recycling energy from the suspension of vehicles to improve the vehicleâ€™s endurance. The {{purpose of this study}} is to develop a semi-active suspension control system with an energy harvesting system. Instead of the <b>fixed</b> <b>orifices</b> in conventional vehicles, an adjusting damping force method with variable resistance circuits system is studied for the semi-active suspension control system. Thus, we are able to develop semi-active control to improve the riding comfort. The energy harvesting system contains a hydraulic gear motor and a DC generator. When vehicles vibrate, the hydraulic damper serves as a hydraulic pump to compress the oil and drive the hydraulic motor. At the same time, the hydraulic motor drives the generator to generate electricity which will be stored in a battery. In this study, the test rig is the quarter-car system. We first design the novel hydraulic suspension system combining with the energy harvesting system. The simulation of dynamic mathematical model will be performed and analyzed by MATLAB/Simulink. Besides that, the semiactive control by the fuzzy sliding mode controller will be realized in the hydraulic suspension system with energy harvesting system. Finally, a test rig is set up for practical experimental implementation and verification...|$|R

5000|$|Water mist {{systems are}} used for special {{applications}} {{in which it is}} decided that creating a heat absorbent vapor is the primary objective. This type of system is typically used where water damage may be a concern, or where water supplies are limited. NFPA 750 defines water mist as a water spray with a droplet size of [...] "less than 1000 microns at the minimum operation pressure of the discharge nozzle." [...] The droplet size can be controlled by the adjusting discharge pressure through a nozzle of a <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice</b> size. By creating a mist, an equal volume of water will create a larger total surface area exposed to the fire. The larger total surface area better facilitates the transfer of heat, thus allowing more water droplets to turn to steam more quickly. A water mist, which absorbs more heat than water per unit time, due to exposed surface area, will more effectively cool the room, thus reducing the temperature of the flame.|$|E

40|$|What is aeration? Aeration {{is a step}} in {{wastewater}} treatment where air is added to wastewater for mixing purposes and to enhance biological growth. The purpose of aeration is to dissolve oxygen into wastewater so that the microorganisms can utilize it while they break down organic material. What is fine bubble aeration? Fine bubble aeration is a subsurface form of diffusion in which air is introduced in the form of very small bubbles to aid or enhance the treatment of wastewater. Air flows from a pipe into diffusers located {{at the bottom of a}} tank. These diffusers have numerous small openings (known as pores) through which air flows into the wastewater in the tank. In the past, various diffusion devices have been classified as either fine bubble or coarse bubble based on how efficiently they transferred oxygen to the wastewater. Since it is difficult to clearly distinguish between fine and coarse bubbles, diffused aeration systems have been classified based on the physical characteristics of the equipment. In a fine bubble aeration system, several diffusers are mounted or screwed into a header pipe that may run along the length or width of the tank or on a short manifold mounted on a movable pipe. These diffusers come in various shapes and sizes, such as discs, tubes, domes, and plates. The common types of coarse bubble diffusers are <b>fixed</b> <b>orifices,</b> valved orifices, and static tubes. The bubble size of these diffusers is larger than the porous diffusers, thus, lowering the oxygen transfer efficiency (OTE). Fine pore diffusers (discs, tubes, domes, and plates) are usually made from ceramic, plastic, or flexible perforated membranes. Although many materials can be used to make fine pore diffusers, only these few are being used due to cost considerations, specific characteristics, market size, and other factors.

40|$|During partial liquid {{ventilation}} perfluorocarbon vapour {{is present}} in the exhaled gases. The volumes of these gases are measured by pneumotachometers. Error in measuring tidal volumes will give erroneous measurement of lung compliance during partial liquid ventilation. We aim to compare measured tidal volumes with and without perfluorocarbon vapour using tidal volumes suitable for use in neonates. Tidal volumes were produced with a 100 ml calibration syringe from 20 to 100 ml and with a calibrated Harvard rodent ventilator from 2. 5 to 20 ml. Control tidal volumes were drawn from a humidifier chamber containing water vapour and the PFC tidal volumes were drawn from a humidifier chamber containing water and perfluorocarbon (FC- 77) vapour. Tidal volumes were measured by a <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice,</b> target, differential pressure flowmeter (VenTrak) or a hot-wire anenometer (Bear Cub) placed between the calibration syringe or ventilator and the humidifier chamber.

The damper structure is designed, so that rebound and compression damping forces can be tuned independently, of which the variable valve is placed externally. The rate of pressure change with respect to the flow rate after blow-off becomes smooth when the <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice</b> size increases, which means that the blow-off slope is controllable using the <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice</b> size.

In recent years, variable rate application (VRA) technologies {{have made it possible}} to apply pesticides in variable rates across the field. In pesticide application, nozzles play a vital role. In general, pesticides are applied using conventional nozzles. Most conventional nozzles vary flow rates only over a 2 : 1 range when operated within the recommended pressure range due to a <b>fixed</b> spray <b>orifice.</b> Conventional nozzles vary droplet sizes tremendously when there are speed and application rate changes which results in inefficient application. Conventional nozzles have limitations when used for VRA. A new nozzle called Varitarget nozzle (U. S.

Varitarget nozzles have a variable orifice that changes in size in response to pressure changes, allowing varying flow rates with a minimal change in droplet size.

40|$|BACKGROUND: Portable {{peak flow}} meters {{are used in}} {{clinical}} practice for measurement of peak expiratory flow (PEF) at many different altitudes throughout the world. Some PEF meters are affected by gas density. This study was undertaken to establish which type of meter is best for use above sea level and to determine changes in spirometric measurements at altitude. METHODS: The variable orifice mini-Wright peak flow meter was compared with the <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice</b> Micro Medical Microplus turbine microspirometer at sea level and at Everest Base Camp (5300 m). Fifty one members of the 1994 British Mount Everest Medical Expedition were studied (age range, 19 - 55). RESULTS: Mean forced vital capacity (FVC) fell by 5 % and PEF rose by 25. 5 %. However, PEF recorded with the mini-Wright peak flow meter underestimated PEF by 31 %, giving readings 6. 6 % below sea level values. FVC was lowest in the mornings and did not improve significantly with acclimatisation. Lower PEF values were observed on morning readings and were associated with higher acute mountain sickness scores, although the latter may reflect decreased effort in those with acute mountain sickness. There was no change in forced expiratory volume in one second (FEV 1) at altitude when measured with the turbine microspirometer. CONCLUSIONS: The cause of the fall in FVC at 5300 m is unknown but {{may be attributed to}} changes in lung blood volume, interstitial lung oedema, or early airways closure.

40|$|AbstractObjectives. We used color Doppler flow mapping to {{determine}} whether vena contracta width (VCW) is a load-independent measure {{of the severity of}} mitral regurgitation. Background. VCW has been proposed to be a relatively load-independent measure of mitral regurgitation severity in flow models using a <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice.</b> However, in patients with mitral regurgitation, VCW may not be load independent because of a dynamic regurgitant orifice. Methods. VCW, effective regurgitant orifice area and regurgitant volume were measured by quantitative Doppler mapping in 31 patients with chronic mitral regurgitation at baseline and during nitroprusside infusion. Patients with rheumatic heart disease, annular calcification or endocarditis were considered to have a fixed regurgitant orifice, whereas patients with mitral valve prolapse, dilated cardiomyopathy or ischemia were considered to have a dynamic regurgitant orifice. Results. Systolic blood pressure (148 Â± 27 to 115 Â± 25 mm Hg) and end-systolic wall stress (121 Â± 50 to 89 Â± 36) decreased with nitroprusside (p < 0. 05). Although nitroprusside did not significantly change mean values for VCW (0. 5 Â± 0. 2 to 0. 5 Â± 0. 2 cm), regurgitant volume (69 Â± 47 to 69 Â± 56 ml) or effective regurgitant orifice area (0. 5 Â± 0. 4 to 0. 5 Â± 0. 6 cm 2), individual patients exhibited marked directional variability. Specifically, VCW decreased in 16 patients (improved mitral regurgitation), remained unchanged in 7 patients and increased in 8 patients (worsened mitral regurgitation) with nitroprusside. Also, the VCW response to nitroprusside was concordant with changes in effective regurgitant orifice area and regurgitant volume, and was not different between dynamic and <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice</b> groups. Conclusions. Contrary to the results from in vitro studies, VCW is not load independent in patients with mitral regurgitation caused by dynamic changes in the regurgitant orifice. The origin of mitral regurgitation does not predict accurately whether the regurgitant orifice is fixed or dynamic. Finally, short-term vasodilation with nitroprusside may significantly worsen the severity of mitral regurgitation in some patients...|$|E

Flow {{coefficients}} of intake valves and port combinations were determined experimentally for a compressed nitrogen engine under steady-state and dynamic flow conditions for inlet pressures up to 3. 2 MPa. Variable valve timing was {{combined with an}} indexed parked piston cylinder unit for testing valve flows at different cylinder volumes whilst maintaining realistic in-cylinder transient pressure profiles by simply using a <b>fixed</b> area outlet <b>orifice.</b> A one-dimensional modelling approach describing three-dimensional valve flow characteristics has been developed {{by the use of}} variable flow coefficients that take into account the propagation of flow jets and their boundaries as a function of downstream/upstream pressure ratios. The results obtained for the dynamic flow cases were compared with steadystate results for the cylinder to inlet port pressure ratios ranges from 0. 18 to 0. 83. The deviation of flow coefficients for both cases is discussed using pulsatile flow theory. The key findings include: 1. For a given valve lift, the steady-state flow coefficients fall by up to 21 percent with increasing cylinder/manifold pressure ratios within the measured range given above; 2. Transient flow coefficients deviated from those measured for the steady-state flow as the valve lift increases beyond a critical value of approximately 0. 5 mm. The deviation can be due to the insufficient time of the development of steady state boundary layers, which can be quantified by the instantaneous Womersley number defined by using the transient hydraulic diameter.

A transparent accumulator and transparent tubes at the inlet and outlet of the accumulator are used to visualize the flow of the refrigerant. High speed video snapshots are presented for the first seconds after the start-up. The oil distribution at steady state as a function of total refrigerant charge is presented. In addition, the entrainment ratio of the liquid refrigerant and oil mixture through the oil bleeding hole of the accumulator is determined...|$|E
40|$|The {{performance}} of systems involving {{a body in}} a fluid flow can be enhanced by manipulation of the body shape through flow control. Active flow control, {{the focus of this}} work, is achieved by energizing low-momentum regions at the wall by tangential blowing using air. One mechanism for blowing air into this region is through synthetic jets. They are devices that push air out from a <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice</b> or a slit {{in the form of a}} jet. The jets are usually created using compressed air or an electromechanically driven vibrating platform. To diminish complexity, reduce weight, and increase time response, piezoelectric actuators used as oscillating diaphragms are often used. This study concentrates on characterizing a synthetic jet using three types of piezoelectric actuators as circular mechanical diaphragms: (1) pre-stressed curved metallic Unimorph or Thunder, (2) Bimorphs, and (3) Radial Field Diaphragms, RFD. The diaphragm is clamped around its perimeter, so that when voltage is applied to the device, it oscillates and a jet is pushed out an orifice perpendicular to the actuator. Maximum synthetic jet velocity into quiescent flow was monitored when varying frequencies, and driving waveforms of the diaphragms, as well as varying physical cavity characteristics. Results show that maximum velocity magnitude is markedly different wit...|$|E

WolfTraditionally, growers spray uniform {{application}} of pesticides over the target area regardless of variations in pest infestations. In recent years, variable rate application (VRA) technologies {{have made it possible}} to apply pesticides in variable rates across the field. In pesticide application, nozzles play a vital role. In general, pesticides are applied using conventional nozzles. Most conventional nozzles vary flow rates only over a 2 : 1 range when operated within the recommended pressure range due to a <b>fixed</b> spray <b>orifice.</b> Conventional nozzles vary droplet sizes tremendously when there are speed and application rate changes which results in inefficient application. Conventional nozzles have limitations when used for VRA. A new nozzle called Varitarget nozzle (U. S. Patent No. 5, 134, 961) was developed and marketed by Bui, (2005) to overcome the limitations with conventional nozzles. Varitarget nozzles have a variable orifice that changes in size in response to pressure changes, allowing varying flow rates with a minimal change in droplet size. Laboratory tests and field tests were conducted to study the performance of Varitarget nozzle. Varitarget black/blue and clear/yellow caps were evaluated in this study. Lab studies were conducted to measure Varitarget characteristics compared to conventional nozzles. The flow rate ratios of Varitarget nozzle black and clear caps were 12 : 1 and 10 : 1 while the conventional nozzles produced flow rate ratios ranging from only 3 : 1 to 4 : 1. The measured flow rate of Varitarget nozzle black and clear caps was similar to that published by the manufacturer up to 40 psi and varied higher after 40 psi. Both Varitarget black and clear cap nozzle was within the standard VMD requirements until 40 psi and showed increasing trend while the conventional nozzles matched the standard VMD requirements. The VT black and clear cap nozzles showed better coverage at higher pressures when compared to conventional nozzles. CV values for VT black and clear capped nozzles were less than 10 % which indicates capability of good uniform distribution. Spray angle of 110 degrees for VT black and clear capped nozzles was consistent over a range of pressures. Field studies were also conducted to compare the Varitarget to conventional nozzles. In the varying speed study, droplet size varied from 498 to 621 microns with a SD of 47. 50 for VT black nozzle and 465 to 599 microns with a SD of 54. 08 for VT clear cap nozzle as the speed varied from 4 to 12 mph. In the varying application rate study, The droplet size varied from 432 to 510 microns with a SD of 27. 84 for VT black nozzle and 355 to 452 microns with a SD of 39. 80 as the application rate varied from 4 to 12 GPA. In both studies, the observed pressure range required for spraying was minimum and varied slightly...|$|R
40|$|The leakage {{reduction}} {{problem as}} a whole is complex and requires co-ordinated actions in different areas of water network management, such as: direct detection and repair of existing bursts, general pipe rehabilitation programmes and operational pressure control. Water companies undertake a mixture of these complimentary actions. General pipe rehabilitation is the most costly and long term action, but is undertaken to improve a number of different factors including leakage and water quality. Operational pressure control is a cost-effective action for reducing leakage over whole sub-networks, and for reducing the risk of further leaks by smoothing pressure variations and is the subject of ongoing research. Detection and repair actions are targeted at sub-networks where bursts are present. Benefits of quick burst repair include reduced water losses, reduced disruption to traffic, reduced consequent losses (e. g. from flooding), and also reduced disruption to customers' supplies, which is an important water industry performance measure. The existing methods typically use passive identification approach whilst the presented approach is based on the active identification procedure. The proposed burst location algorithm is based on comparing data by means of statistical analysis from a simple field experiment with results of water network simulation. An extended network hydraulic simulator is used to model pressure dependent leakage terms. The presence of a burst changes the flow pattern and also pressure at network nodes, which may be used to estimate the burst size and its location. The influence of such random factors as demand flows and background leakage on the process of burst detection is also considered. The field experiment is an extended <b>fixed</b> and variable <b>orifice</b> (e-FAVOR) test. During this test inlet pressure is being stepped up and down and the following variables are measured: inlet flow, inlet pressure (head) and pressure at a number of selected sensitive nodes. The method consists of three stages and uses two different models; one is inlet flow model (IFM) to represent the total inlet flow and another is the extended hydraulic model to simulate different burst locations. Initially the presence of a potential burst is investigated. If this is confirmed values of the demand, background leakage flow and burst flow in IFM are subsequently estimated. These are used to identify the burst site at the third stage of the method. The approach has been validated by solving a practical case study with correct diagnosis of the existing problems...|$|R
40|$|Abstract Background Prolonged weaning from {{mechanical}} ventilation {{has a major}} impact on ICU bed occupancy and patient outcome, and has significant cost implications. There is evidence in patients around the period of extubation that helium-oxygen leads to a reduction in the work of breathing. Therefore breathing helium-oxygen during weaning may be a useful adjunct to facilitate weaning. We hypothesised that breathing helium-oxygen would reduce carbon dioxide production during the weaning phase of {{mechanical ventilation}}. Materials/patients and methods We performed a prospective randomised controlled single blinded cross-over trial on 19 adult intensive care patients without significant airways disease who fulfilled criteria for weaning with CPAP. Patients were randomised to helium-oxygen and air-oxygen delivered during a 2 hour period of CPAP ventilation. Carbon dioxide production (VCO 2) was measured using a near patient main stream infrared carbon dioxide sensor and <b>fixed</b> <b>orifice</b> pneumotachograph. Results Compared to air-oxygen, helium-oxygen significantly decreased VCO 2 production {{at the end of the}} 2 hour period of CPAP ventilation; there was a mean difference in CO 2 production of 48. 9 ml/min (95 % CI 18. 7 - 79. 2 p = 0. 003) between the groups. There were no significant differences in other respiratory and haemodynamic parameters. Conclusion This study shows that breathing a helium-oxygen mixture during weaning reduces carbon dioxide production. This physiological study supports the need for a clinical trial of helium-oxygen mixture during the weaning phase of mechanical ventilation with duration of weaning as the primary outcome.
