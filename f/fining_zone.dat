40|$|Abstract This work {{examines}} how heterogeneity structure, in particular correlation length, controls flow and solute transport. We used two-dimensional (2 D) sandboxes (21. 9 cm 3 20. 6 cm) and four modeling approaches, including 2 D Advection-Dispersion Equation (ADE) with explicit heterogeneity structure, 1 D ADE with average properties, and nonlocal Continuous Time Random Walk (CTRW) and fractional ADE (fADE). The {{goal is to}} answer two questions: (1) how {{and to what extent}} does correlation length control effective permeability and breakthrough curves (BTC) ? (2) Which model can best reproduce data under what conditions? Sandboxes were packed with the same 20 % (v/v) fine and 80 % (v/v) coarse sands in three patterns that differ in correlation length. The Mixed cases contain uniformly distributed fine and coarse grains. The Four-zone and One-zone cases have four and one square <b>fine</b> <b>zones,</b> respectively. A total of seven experiments were carried out with permeability variance of 0. 10 (LC), 0. 22 (MC), and 0. 43 (HC). Experi-mental data show that the BTC curves depend strongly on correlation length, especially in the HC cases. The HC One-zone (HCO) case shows distinct breakthrough steps arising from fast advection in the coarse zone, slow advection in the <b>fine</b> <b>zone,</b> and slow diffusion, while the LCO and MCO BTCs do not exhibit such behavior. With explicit representation of heterogeneity structure, 2 D ADE reproduces BTCs well in all cases.

40|$|Summary. Block-structured AMR meshes {{are often}} used in astrophysical fluid simulations, where the {{geometry}} of the domain is simple. We consider potential efficiency gains for time sub-cycling, or time refinement (TR), on Berger-Collela and oct-tree AMR meshes for explicit or local physics (such as explict hydrodynamics), where the work per block is roughly constant with level of refinement. We note that there are generally many more <b>fine</b> <b>zones</b> than there are coarse zones. We then quantify the natural result that any overall efficiency gains from {{reducing the amount of}} work on the relatively few coarse zones must necessarily be fairly small. Potential efficiency benefits from TR on these meshes are seen to be quite limited except in the case of refining a small number of points on a large mesh — in this case, the benefit can be made arbitrarily large, albeit at the expense of spatial refinement efficiency. ...|$|R

5000|$|A major {{development}} in the area's history occurred when U.S. Route 101 was rerouted through Prunedale between 1931 and 1932. [...] Highway 101 had previously routed directly from Salinas to San Juan Bautista. That old route {{is now known as}} San Juan Grade Road. In 1946, Highway 101 was widened to 4 lanes. As Prunedale has grown, increased traffic congestion made Route 101 through Prunedale a Traffic Safety Corridor and a double traffic <b>fine</b> <b>zone</b> in the late 1990s and early 2000s, with reduced speed limits to 55. Detailed plans to build a 101 bypass of Prunedale did not develop. After Caltrans purchased the land for the bypass, it was resolved to improve the highway through Prunedale by adding a San Miguel Canyon overpass, improving the Highway 101 and Highway 156 interchange, making more turn and merge lanes, and making several other improvements on the roadway.

With a further increasing the passes to 9, this X-shape zone tends to spread the whole sample. However, the grain difference between the coarse grain <b>zone</b> and <b>fine</b> grain <b>zone</b> still exists on the sample forged by 9 passes. Limitation in the structural refinement is observed {{in the center of the}} sample with the increment of equivalent strain. The grains size in the center is refined to a certain size (about 70 μ m) as equivalent strain reaches 2. 5, and no further grain refinement in the center with increasing the equivalent strain to 6. 0.

40|$|Active {{remedial}} {{activities have}} been ongoing since 1996 to address {{low levels of}} solvent contamination at the Miscellaneous Chemical Basin at SRS. Contaminant levels in the subsurface may be approaching levels where mass transfer limitations are impacting {{the efficiency of the}} remedial action. Rate limited mass transfer effects have been observed at other sites in the vadose zone at the SRS, however, detailed measurements and evaluation has not been undertaken. Anecdotal evidence suggests that the mass transfer rates are very slow from the fine grain sediments. This conclusion is based on the observation that measured soil gas concentrations tend to be low in permeable zones relative to the higher concentrations found in <b>fine</b> grain <b>zones.</b> Decreasing soil gas concentration with depth below the ''upland unit'' at several areas at SRS is also evidence of slow diffusion rates. In addition, due to the length of time since disposal ceased at the MCB, we hypothesize that mobile solvents have migrated downward, and the solvent remaining in the upper <b>fine</b> grain <b>zone</b> (''upland unit'') are trapped in fine grain material and are primarily released by gas diffusion (Riha and Rossabi 2004). Natural weathering and other chemical solutions disposed with the solvents can further enhance this effect by increasing the micro-porosity in the clays (kaolinite). This microporosity can result in increased entrapment of water and solvents by capillary forces (Powers, et. al., 2003). Also supporting this conclusion is the observation that active SVE has proven ineffective on VOC removal from the <b>fine</b> grain <b>zones</b> at the SRS. Adsorption and the very slow release phenomenon have been documented similarly in the literature especially for old solvent spills such as at the SRS (Pavlostathis and Mathavan 1992; Oostrom and Lenhard 2003). Mass transfer relationships need to be developed in order to optimize remediation activities and to determine actual loading rates to groundwater. These metrics will aid in answering the question ''How clean is protective of the environment''? For this study, a field test was developed to measure a mass transfer factor by injecting clean air into the subsurface through a sample port or well and measuring the rebound VOC concentration over time. Interpretation of the he results of these tests will provide a mass transfer rate that will be used to determine the appropriate type of SVE for the area (passive, enhanced or active SVE), a measured field parameter to estimate mass loading to the groundwater, and time frame for cleanup...|$|R

40|$|Abstract. In {{very high}} cycle fatigue, VHCF, regime, fatigue crack {{initiation}} can occur at subsurface defects such as inclusion or subsurface non-defect (matrix) origin. This paper provides {{a study on}} the fatigue crack initiation mechanisms at subsurface non-defect (matrix) origin in two metallic materials using electron backscatter diffraction and electron channeling contrast imaging. The results show that the strains in the material in the VHCF regime were highly localized, where the local maximum strain is greatly higher than the average strain value. This high strain localization can lead to the formation of <b>fine</b> grain <b>zone</b> and also fatigue damage or fatigue crack initiation at grain boundaries or twin boundaries by impingement cracking. High strain localization is caused by strain accumulation of each very small loading, and also increases the local hardness of the material. This may start quasi-cleavage crack origin, and consequently the formation of subsurface fatigue crack initiations. The results also show that fatigue damage and crack initiation mechanisms in the VHCF regime can be different in different metals due to the mechanisms for local plasticity exhaustion...|$|R

The Critical <b>Zone</b> includes the <b>fine</b> <b>zone</b> between the lower atmosphere {{at the top of the}} canopy down to thebedrock-soil interface. This lithosphere-atmosphere boundary is critical for the availability of life-sustainingresources and critical for humanity because this is the zone where we live, where we build our cities, from whichwe extract our food and our water and where we release most of our wastes. This is the fragile zone on which thenatural ecosystem relies because this is where nutrients are being released from the rocks. OZCAR is a distributed research infrastructure gathering instrumented sites and catchments on continentalsurfaces all dedicated to the observation and monitoring of the different compartments of the Critical Zone atthe national scale. All these observatories (more that 40) were all built up on specific questions (acid deposition,flood prediction, urban hydrology...), some of them more than 50 years ago, but they have all in common tobe highly instrumented, permanently funded as infrastructures. They all share the same overarching goal ofunderstanding and predicting the Critical Zone in a changing world. OZCAR gathers instrumented catchments,hydrogeological sites, peatlands, glacier and permafrost regions and a spatial observatory under the commonumbrella of understanding water and biogeochemical cycles and the associated fluxes of energy by using naturalgradients and experimentation. Based on the collaboration with Southern Countries, OZCAR’s sites have a globalcoverage including tropical areas and high mountainous regions in the Andes and the Himalaya. OZCAR benefits from a French investments project called CRITEX (Innovative equipment for the critical zone,[URL]) that is centered on the development and deployment of innovativeinstrumentation in the sites.

Secondly, small irregular nodules of the obsidian, either standing separately, or united into thin layers, seldom more than the tenth of an inch in thickness, alternate repeatedly with very thin layers of a feldspathic rock, which is striped with the <b>finest</b> parallel <b>zones</b> of colour, like an agate, and which sometimes passes {{into the nature of}} pitchstone; the interstices between the nodules of obsidian are generally filled by soft white matter, resembling pumiceous ashes.

Such masses (as well as the small nodules) of obsidian are of a pale green colour, and are generally streaked with different shades of colour, parallel to the laminae of the surrounding rock; they likewise generally contain minute white sphaerulites, of which half is sometimes embedded in a zone of one shade of colour, and half in a zone of another shade.

A maximum elongation to failure of about 300 % was obtained for the 46. 8 Al material while about 900 % was recorded for the 46 Al material at 1050 °C at a relatively high strain rate of 8 × 10 − 3 s− 1. This difference is attributed to the larger volume fraction of α 2 -phase particles in the 46 Al material {{that leads to a}} decrease of the number and size of band like regions of coarse γ grains. The microstructure in the fine-grained areas of both materials remains essentially constant during deformation. The mechanical behavior at high temperature of these superplastic materials can be explained by considering grain boundary sliding as the dominant deformation mechanism. Peer reviewe...|$|R
40|$|This paper {{investigates the}} {{destination}} choice problem in transportation planning processes. Most models assume a Multinomial Logit (MNL) {{form for the}} problem. The MNL cannot account for unobserved similarities which exist among choice alternatives. The {{purpose of this paper}} is to investigate alternative destination choice model structures, focusing on closed-form models. The paper reviews recent GEV formulations and discusses the adaptation of these models to destination choice situation. In addition the paper presents a new model structure composed of three hierarchical levels: it assumes a choice process composed of a broad selection of zones based on a specific land use characteristic (in this case, presence of shopping center) and then a <b>finer</b> selection of <b>zones</b> based on a geographical characteristic (in this case, adjacent zones). To illustrate the similarity measures of selected GEV formulations and the new model structure the paper specifies, estimates and compares destination choice models for weekday shopping trips based on a revealed preference survey. The paper discusses the structure of the proposed choice models, similarity measures and implementation issues related to the GEV destination choice models. ...|$|R
