Forrest claimed Bannon and {{her books}} [...] "are {{in a class}} by themselves" [...] and credits Bannon with saving her life, writing in 2005, [...] "Overwhelming need led me to walk a {{gauntlet}} of fear up to the cash register. Fear so intense that I remember nothing more, only that I stumbled out of the store in possession of what I knew I must have, a book as necessary to me as air...

2500|$|Former Shreveport Mayor Jim Gardner, in his memoirs, recalls {{details of}} the Morrison funeral:"The Morrison funeral was a moving and {{impressive}} event. A motorcade formed {{in front of the}} Capitol House Hotel [...] at 8:45 a.m. on Tuesday, May 26, 1964. There were about twenty automobiles led by the governor [...] I rode down with four other state representatives in Representative Spencer Todd's brand new Cadillac. Others in the car were Conway LeBleu, Joe Henry Cooper, and Steve Dupuis. It turned out that Steve lived next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> cousin ... in Opelousas.|$|E
2500|$|It was {{initially}} stated by police that Menezes was shot {{five times in}} the head. Mark Whitby, a passenger on the train Menezes had run onto, said: 'one of [...] was carrying a black handgun—it looked like an automatic—He half tripped… they pushed him to the floor, bundled {{on top of him}} and unloaded five shots into him.' Another passenger, Dan Copeland, said: 'an officer jumped on the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> left and screamed, [...] "Everybody out!" [...] People just froze in their seats cowering for a few seconds and then leapt up. As I turned out the door on to the platform, I heard four dull bangs.' Menezes's cousin Alex Pereira, who lived with him, asserted that Menezes had been shot from behind: 'I pushed my way into the morgue. [...] They wouldn't let me see him. His mouth was twisted by the wounds and it looked like he had been shot {{from the back of the}} neck.' Later reports confirmed that Jean Charles de Menezes was shot a total of eight times: seven times in the head and once in the shoulder.|$|E

2500|$|In his {{autobiography}} From Hope to Higher Ground, Huckabee recalled the chilly reception {{that he received}} from the Arkansas Democratic establishment on his election as lieutenant governor: [...] "The <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> office were spitefully nailed shut from the inside, office furniture and equipment were removed, and the budget spent down to almost nothing prior to our arriving. After fifty-nine days of public outcry, the doors were finally opened for me to occupy the actual office I had been elected to hold two months earlier." ...|$|R

60|$|A part of {{each day}} was spent in {{studying}} the historical monuments of the city, and the remaining time was given to reading at the Young Men's Union or in the Public Library, which stood next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> lodging house.|$|E
6000|$|May 26.--The {{business}} at the Court heavy. Dined at Gala's, and had the pleasure {{to see him in}} amended health. Sir John and Lady Hope were there, and the evening was lively and pleasant. George Square is always a melancholy place for me.

6000|$|... "I will," [...] said Mr Auberly with emotion. [...] "Send {{him to me}} on Thursday forenoon. He {{will find}} me living next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> my--to <b>my</b> late home. I shall stay with a friend there for some time. Good-night." ...|$|R
6000|$|... "No," [...] said Brooke, with {{a little}} hollow laugh. [...] "Not seriously, anyway. The fellow flung the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> in <b>my</b> face, and the blow must have partly dazed me. That reminds me that I'm wasting time. Where is he now?" ...|$|R
6000|$|I {{heard a noise}} below, and I went <b>to</b> the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> listen. <b>My</b> {{heart beat}} violently, but, alas! it was not she, and, bitterly disappointed, I {{returned}} to the chair. I thought I had been waiting hours, and every hour seemed a day. Would she never come? ...|$|R
60|$|I {{looked at}} the clock. It was a quarter to twelve. This {{could not be a}} visitor at so late an hour. A patient, evidently, and {{possibly}} an all-night sitting. With a wry face I went out into the hall and opened the <b>door.</b> <b>To</b> <b>my</b> astonishment it was Sherlock Holmes who stood upon my step.|$|E
60|$|I {{had just}} {{finished}} tidying up the office when there came a peremptory ring at the outer door, repeated at intervals of twenty seconds or so. It meant giving a hasty glance all round to see that no fragments of onion pie or of cheap claret lingered in unsuspected places, and it meant my going, myself, to open the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> impatient visitor.|$|E
60|$|Instinct {{kept him}} away from the more frequented streets--and {{instinct}} after awhile drew him in the direction of his friend's house at the comer of The Circus. Sir Percy Blakeney had not gone out fortunately: the lacquey who opened the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> lord Tony stared astonished and almost paralysed for the moment at the extraordinary appearance of his lordship. Rain dropped down from the brim of his hat on to his shoulders: his boots were muddy to the knees, his clothes wringing wet. His eyes were wild and hazy and there was a curious tremor round his mouth.|$|E

50|$|The {{song was}} {{produced}} by Rick James. In the song, the group declares their devotion to a man and telling him {{that they will be}} available to him anytime: If you need some love and tenderness / And it's me, baby, that you miss / Here's the key <b>to</b> unlock the <b>door</b> / <b>To</b> <b>my</b> house, my house.|$|R
6000|$|But The Man {{does not}} know that {{she is in the}} hotel, nor that she has left her husband; it is only {{accident}} that brings them together. And it is only by accident that he has come into her room, at night, and stands there--rooted to the threshold. Now as a matter of fact, in real life, there is nothing at all in the simple fact of walking into the wrong room of an hotel by accident. You merely apologise and go out. I had this experience myself only a few days ago. I walked right into a lady's room--next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> own. But I simply said, [...] "Oh, I beg your pardon, I thought this was No. 343." ...|$|E
6000|$|It is {{wonderful}} how people daily deceive {{themselves on the}} subject of property; those who care the most about it, appearing to make the greatest blunders. In the way of bequests, in particular, the lies that are told are marvellous. It is now many years since I learned to take no heed of rumours on such subjects, and least of all, rumours that come from the class of the money-gripers. Such people refer everything to dollars, and seldom converse a minute without using the word. Here, however, was Major Merton evidently Rupert's dupe; though with what probable consequences, it was not in my power to foresee. It was clearly not my business to undeceive him; and the conversation, getting to be embarrassing, I was not sorry to hear the movement which announced the end of the act. At the box <b>door,</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> great regret, we met Mrs. Drewett retiring, the ladies finding the farce dull, and not worth the time lost in listening to it. Rupert gave me an uneasy glance, and he even dragged me aside to whisper--"Miles, what I told you this evening, is strictly a family secret, and was entrusted to a friend." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "I think not," [...] {{answered}} Rinkitink. [...] "You see, {{one of my}} clever subjects {{has written}} a parchment entitled 'How to be Good,' and I believed it would benefit me to study it, as I consider the accomplishment of being good one of the fine arts. I had just scolded severely my Lord High Chancellor for coming to breakfast without combing his eyebrows, and was so sad and regretful at having hurt the poor man's feelings that I decided to shut myself up in my own room and study the scroll until I knew how to be good--hee, heek, keek, eek, eek!--to be good! Clever idea, that, wasn't it? Mighty clever! And I issued a decree {{that no one should}} enter my room, under pain of my royal displeasure, until I was ready to come out. They're awfully afraid of my royal displeasure, although not a bit afraid of me. Then I put the parchment in my pocket and escaped through the back <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> boat--and here I am. Oo, hoo-hoo, keek-eek! Imagine the fuss there would be in Gilgad if my subjects knew where I am this very minute!" ...|$|E
60|$|Another {{trick of}} mine which told against my {{reputation}} was my choice of roosting-place in an active draught upon the cabin floor. I was openly jeered and flouted for this eccentricity; and a considerable knot would sometimes {{gather at the}} <b>door</b> <b>to</b> see <b>my</b> last dispositions for the night. This was embarrassing, but I learned to support the trial with equanimity.|$|R
40|$|With {{the release}} of the iPad in 2010, {{interactive}} storytelling has become a tool being used by media publications to engage their consumers. The unique characteristic of the iPad being touch-based lends to many new ways of story presentation. The audience is now able to have an active role in receiving their daily information, rather than being a passive consumer. Just like several professional media publications, a team of Ball State student media designers and editors set out to create an iPad app for Ball Bearings Magazine. As the team leader for tablet development, this project was not as simple one. But after a semester of dedication, Ball Bearings Magazine is now available in the app store on the iPad. It was an eye opening learning experience that opened new <b>doors</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> future as a designer. Honors CollegeThesis (B. ?. ...|$|R
60|$|One day in Sloane Street I {{found myself}} {{questioning}} Paraday’s landlord, {{who had come}} <b>to</b> the <b>door</b> in answer <b>to</b> <b>my</b> knock. Two vehicles, a barouche and a smart hansom, were drawn up before the house.|$|R
6000|$|Nothing {{could give}} me more {{satisfaction}} than what Thomas had related; so now, I thought I would ask about the Lady Roxana (for he had been my next-door neighbour when I had that title conferred on me). [...] "Pray, Thomas," [...] said I, [...] "did not you speak of a great person of quality, whose name I have forgot, that lived next <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> Lord ----'s when you was his valet? pray who was she? I suppose a foreigner, by the name you called her." [...] "Really, my lady," [...] replied he, [...] "I do not know who she was; all I can say of her is, that she kept the greatest company, and was a beautiful woman, by report, but I never saw her; she was called the Lady Roxana, {{was a very good}} mistress, but her character was not so good as to private life as it ought to be. Though I once had an opportunity," [...] continued he, [...] "of seeing a fine outlandish dress she danced in before the king, which I took as a great favour, for the cook took me up when the lady was out, and she desired my lady's woman to show it to me." ...|$|E
6000|$|... "When I woke {{up again}} {{the effects of}} the pausodyne had worn {{themselves}} out, and I felt that I must have remained unconscious for at least a week or a fortnight. My candle had gone out, and I could not find my tinder-box. I rose up slowly and with difficulty, for the air of the room was close and filled with fumes, and made my way in the dark towards the <b>door.</b> <b>To</b> <b>my</b> surprise, the bolt was so stiff with rust that it would hardly move. I opened it after a struggle, and found myself in the passage. Groping my way towards the trap-door of the cellar, I felt it was obstructed by some heavy body. With an immense effort, for my strength seemed but feeble, I pushed it up, and discovered that a heap of sea-coals lay on top of it. I extricated myself into the cellar, and there a fresh surprise awaited me. A new entrance had been made into the front, so that I walked out at once upon the open road, instead of up the stairs into the kitchen. Looking up at the exterior of my house, my brain reeled with bewilderment when I saw that it had disappeared almost entirely, and that a different porch and wholly unfamiliar windows occupied its façade. I must have slept far longer than I at first imagined--perhaps a whole year or more. A vague terror prevented me from walking up the steps of my own home. Possibly my brother, thinking me dead, might have sold the lease; possibly some stranger might resent my intrusion into the house that was now his own. At any rate, I thought it safer to walk into the road. I would go towards London, to my brother's house in St. Mary le Bone. I turned into the Hampstead Road, and directed my steps thitherward.|$|E

"Oh, Julia! here I am, {{and such}} a place!--no town, no churches, no [...] Broadway, nothing that can make life desirable; and, I may add, no [...] friend--nobody to see and talk with, but papa and mamma, and a [...] house full of {{brothers}} and sisters.

6000|$|All {{the friends}} of the Newcome family, of course, knew the {{disaster}} which had befallen the good Colonel, and I was aware, for my own part, that not only his own, but almost the whole of Rosa Newcome's property was involved in the common ruin. Some proposals of temporary relief were made to our friends from more quarters than one, but were thankfully rejected--and we were led to hope that the Colonel, having still his pension secured to him, which the law could not touch, might live comfortably enough the retirement to which, of course, he would betake himself, when the melancholy proceedings consequent on the bankruptcy were brought to an end. It was shown that he had been egregiously duped in the transaction--that his credulity had cost him and his family a large fortune--that he had given up every penny which belonged to him--that there could not be any sort of stain upon his honest reputation. The judge before whom he appeared spoke with feeling and regard of the unhappy gentleman--the lawyer who examined him respected the grief and fall of that simple old man. Thomas Newcome took a little room near the court where his affairs and the affairs of the company were adjudged--lived with a frugality which never was difficult to him--And once when perchance I met him in the City, avoided me, with a bow and courtesy that was quite humble, though proud and somehow inexpressibly touching to me. Fred Bayham was the only person whom he admitted. Fred always faithfully insisted upon attending him in and out of court. J. J. came to me immediately after he heard of the disaster, eager to place all his savings at the service of his friends. Laura and I came to London, and were urgent with similar offers. Our good friend declined to see any of us. F. B., again, with tears trickling on his rough cheeks, and a break in his voice, told me he feared that affairs must be very bad indeed, for the Colonel absolutely denied himself a cheroot to smoke. Laura drove to his lodgings and took him a box, which was held up to him as he came to open the <b>door</b> <b>to</b> <b>my</b> wife's knock by our smiling little boy, He patted the child on his golden head and kissed him. My wife wished he would have done as much for her--but he would not--though she owned she kissed his hand. He drew it across his eyes and thanked her in a very calm and stately manner--but he did not invite her within the threshold of his door, saying simply, that such a room was not a fit place to receive a lady, [...] "as you ought to know very well, Mrs. Smith," [...] he said to the landlady, who had accompanied my wife up the stairs. [...] "He will eat scarcely anything," [...] the woman told us, [...] "his meals come down untouched; his candles are burning all night, almost, as he sits poring over his papers." ...|$|E
