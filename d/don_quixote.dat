5|$|<b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> in England {{was started}} as Fielding's second play, {{but it was}} not {{finished}} and produced until the later part of his career. After Fielding returned to London from the University of Leyden during the end of 1729, he brought with him a version of <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> in England. It was refused by the Theatre Royal and it was not produced or printed until 1734. The only information on the origins of this play come from Fielding's 1734 preface. It was his second play, and Fielding attributes it to being written at Leyden during 1728. It was intended more as amusement than as a serious production and was an imitation of Cervantes's <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote.</b> After the prompting of Barton Booth and Colley Cibber, Fielding put away the play until 1733, when the Drury-Lane actors asked him for a new play. Soon after, Fielding rewrote parts of the play.|$|E

5|$|Upon {{her return}} to the stage, she danced the Queen of the Dryads in <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> in May 2013. Nelson George began filming a {{documentary}} leverage the chance to present her comeback. Copeland reprised her role as Gulnare in June 2013 in the pirate-themed Le Corsaire. She also played an Odalisque in the same ballet. Later in the year, she danced in Tharp's choreography of Bach Partita for Violin No. 2 in D minor for solo violin, and as Columbine in ABT's revival of Ratmansky's Nutcracker at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.|$|E
5|$|Although The Covent-Garden Tragedy {{appeared}} with The Old Debauchees, {{it was not}} a success like the other play and quickly dropped. The Covent Garden Tragedy was immediately ended after its first night because, according to Fielding, of the play's use of a brothel as a setting. After all, the plot focuses on a love triangle between characters in a brothel. Even though the first night fell apart, the play was later performed; it eventually appeared again for four nights with <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> in England, once on its own in 1734, and a few later times during the 18th century, including as a puppet show.|$|E
5|$|However, {{there is}} little {{evidence}} that Fielding lacked funds, or that such a lack of funds would cause him to leave Leyden to return to writing plays; Fielding eventually returned to Leyden on 22 February 1729. It is not know when or why Fielding left the school, but he produced The Temple Beau on 26 January 1730, which suggests that he returned to London by November 1729. By the time of his return, he had three plays, either still in draft form or complete: <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> in England, The Wedding-Day and The Temple Beau. Of these, only The Temple Beau was accepted for the stage.|$|E

His opera Die beiden Neffen (The Two Nephews) was rehearsed {{for him on}} his 15th birthday. 1829 saw Die Heimkehr aus der Fremde (Son and Stranger or Return of the Roamer), a comedy of mistaken identity written in honour of his parents' silver anniversary and unpublished during his lifetime. In 1825 he wrote a more sophisticated work, Die Hochzeit des Camacho (Camacho's Wedding), based on an episode in <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote,</b> for public consumption. It was produced in Berlin in 1827, but coolly received. Mendelssohn left the theatre before {{the conclusion of the}} first performance, and subsequent performances were cancelled.|$|E
5|$|Originally themed {{around the}} Middle Ages, Medieval Faire is {{a section of}} Canada's Wonderland, a theme park in Vaughan, Ontario, Canada. As such, early attractions created under Kings Entertainment Company were named after knights, <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote,</b> Vikings, dragons, bats, and beasts. Throughout the Paramount Parks era, the section's new attractions lacked {{appropriate}} theming. The introduction of the Leviathan roller coaster to Medieval Faire in 2012 {{was the first major}} investment in the section since 2000; the park is now under ownership of Cedar Fair. The section includes four roller coasters (The Bat, Dragon Fire, Leviathan, and Wild Beast) and six other rides.|$|E
5|$|Stoll brought Robey to cinema audiences {{a further}} four times during 1923. The first two films were written with the {{intention}} of showcasing the comedian's pantomime talents: One Arabian Night was a reworking of Aladdin and co-starred Lionelle Howard and Edward O'Neill, while Harlequinade visited the roots of pantomime. One of Robey's more notable roles under Stoll was Sancho Panza in Maurice Elvey's 1923 film <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote,</b> for which he received a fee of £700 a week. The amount of time he spent working away from home led to the breakdown of his marriage, and he separated from Ethel in 1923. He had a brief affair with one of his leading ladies {{and walked out of the}} family home.|$|E

Also in 2007, she created {{a leading role in}} C. to C. (Close to Chuck), choreographed by Jorma Elo to A Musical Portrait of Chuck Close, Études 2, 9 & 10, by Philip Glass. Her performances of Tharp's works in the same season were recognized, and she was described as more sophisticated and contemporary as a soloist than she had been as a corps dancer. Her summer 2008 Metropolitan Opera House (the Met) season performances in <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> and Sleeping Beauty were also well received.|$|E
5|$|During Muñoz Rivera's childhood, Barranquitas was a {{small rural}} town. The family's house was {{moderately}} large for the time; it was built with wood and its roof was made with zinc. When he was four, his mother home-schooled him with books from a private library owned by his father. By the age of ten, Muñoz Rivera completed the education offered in the town's school, and finished first in his class. He was educated in Spanish and French, and took music classes with Jorge Colombani. His father hired private tutors to continue his instruction. Muñoz Rivera was a serious student with {{a strong interest in}} Miguel de Cervantes' works, in particular <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote.</b> Other authors that he studied include Fernando de Herrera, Tirso de Molina, Luis de Góngora, and Lope de Vega.|$|E
5|$|It {{was also}} in 1834 that Heliade began {{teaching}} at the Soţietatea Filarmonicăs school (alongside Aristia and the musician Ioan Andrei Wachmann), and published his first translations from Lord Byron (in 1847, he completed the translation of Byron's Don Juan). The next year, he began printing Gazeta Teatrului Naţional (official voice of the National Theater, published until 1836), and translated Molière's Amphitryon into Romanian. In 1839, Heliade also translated Miguel de Cervantes' <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> from a French source. The first collection of his own prose and poetry works saw print in 1836. Interested {{in the development of}} local art, he contributed a brochure on drawing and architecture in 1837, and, during the same year, opened the first permanent exhibit in Wallachia (featuring copies of Western paintings, portraits, and gypsum casts of various known sculptures).|$|E

5|$|The name of Calafia {{was likely}} formed from the Arabic word khalifa (religious state leader) {{which is known}} as caliph in English and califa in Spanish. Similarly, the name of Calafia's monarchy, California, likely {{originated}} from the same root, fabricated by the author to remind the 16th-century Spanish reader of the reconquista, a centuries-long fight between Christians and Muslims which had recently concluded in Spain. The character of Calafia is used by Rodríguez de Montalvo to portray the superiority of chivalry in which the attractive virgin queen is conquered, converted to Christian beliefs and married off. The book was very popular for many decades—Hernán Cortés read it—and it was selected by author Miguel de Cervantes as {{the first of many}} popular and assumed harmful books to be burnt by characters in his famous novel <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote.</b>|$|E
5|$|Copeland {{auditioned for}} several dance {{programs}} in 1999, and each made her {{an offer to}} enroll in its summer program. She performed with ABT {{as part of its}} 1999 and 2000 Summer Intensive programs. By {{the end of the first}} summer, she was asked to join the ABT Studio Company. Her mother insisted that she finish high school, and so Copeland returned to California for her senior year, even though ABT arranged to pay for her performances, housing accommodations and academic arrangements. She studied at the Summer Intensive Program on full scholarship for both summers and was declared ABT's National Coca-Cola Scholar in 2000. In the 2000 Summer Intensive Program, she danced the role of Kitri in <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote.</b> Copeland's strongest memory from the summer is working with Tharp on Push Comes to Shove". Of the 150 dancers in the 2000 Summer Intensive Program, she was one of six selected to join the junior dance troupe.|$|E

He created the rôle of the Prince in Mikhail Baryshnikov's production of Cinderella, the leading male rôle in Antony Tudor's The Tiller in the Fields (1978), Glen Tetley's Contredances (1979), the title rôle of Peter Darrell's Chéri (1980) {{and the lead}} rôle in Lynne Taylor-Corbett's Estuary (1983). In 1984, Bissell starred as a guest artist with the Universal Ballet Company in its first production, Adrienne Dellas's Cinderella. He was partnered by its leading ballerina and general director, Julia Moon. He also performed as a guest artist with the National Ballet of Canada, Scottish Ballet and Pacific Northwest Ballet.

5|$|The Renaissance {{arrived in}} the Iberian {{peninsula}} through the Mediterranean possessions of the Aragonese Crown {{and the city of}} Valencia. Many early Spanish Renaissance writers come from the Kingdom of Aragon, including Ausiàs March and Joanot Martorell. In the Kingdom of Castile, the early Renaissance was heavily influenced by the Italian humanism, starting with writers and poets such as the Marquis of Santillana, who introduced the new Italian poetry to Spain in the early 15th century. Other writers, such as Jorge Manrique, Fernando de Rojas, Juan del Encina, Juan Boscán Almogáver and Garcilaso de la Vega, kept a close resemblance to the Italian canon. Miguel de Cervantes's masterpiece <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> is credited as the first Western novel. Renaissance humanism flourished in the early 16th century, with influential writers such as philosopher Juan Luis Vives, grammarian Antonio de Nebrija and natural historian Pedro de Mexía.|$|E
5|$|Her {{mother told}} Copeland {{that she would}} have to give up ballet, but Bradley wanted Copeland to {{continue}} and offered to host her. DelaCerna agreed to this, and Copeland moved in with Bradley and her family. Eventually, Copeland and DelaCerna signed a management contract and a life-story contract with Bradley. Copeland spent the weekdays with the Bradleys near the coast and the weekends at home with her mother, a two-hour bus ride away. Copeland would spend most of her next three years with the Bradleys. By the age of fourteen, Copeland was the winner of a national ballet contest and won her first solo role. The Bradleys introduced Copeland to books and videos about ballet. When she saw Paloma Herrera, a principal ballerina with ABT, perform at the Dorothy Chandler Pavilion, Copeland began to idolize her as much as she did Mariah Carey. The media first noticed her when she drew 2,000 patrons per show as she performed as Clara in The Nutcracker at the San Pedro High School after only eight months of study. A larger role as Kitri in <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> at the San Pedro Dance Center and a featured role in The Chocolate Nutcracker, an African American version of the tale, narrated by Debbie Allen, soon followed. The latter was presented at UCLA's Royce Hall. Copeland's role was modified especially for her, and included ethnic dances.|$|E
5|$|In October 1932, Ravel {{suffered}} {{a blow to}} the head in a taxi accident. The injury was not thought serious at the time, but in a study for the British Medical Journal in 1988 the neurologist R. A. Henson concludes that it may have exacerbated an existing cerebral condition. As early as 1927 close friends had been concerned at Ravel's growing absent-mindedness, and within a year of the accident he started to experience symptoms suggesting aphasia. Before the accident he had begun work on music for a film, <b>Don</b> <b>Quixote</b> (1933), but he was unable to meet the production schedule, and Jacques Ibert wrote most of the score. Ravel completed three songs for baritone and orchestra intended for the film; they were published as Don Quichotte à Dulcinée. The manuscript orchestral score is in Ravel's hand, but Lucien Garban and Manuel Rosenthal helped in transcription. Ravel composed no more after this. The exact nature of his illness is unknown. Experts have ruled out the possibility of a tumour, and have variously suggested frontotemporal dementia, Alzheimer's disease and Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease. Though no longer able to write music or perform, Ravel remained physically and socially active until his last months. Henson notes that Ravel preserved most or all his auditory imagery and could still hear music in his head.|$|E
