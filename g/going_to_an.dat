500|$|Due to its first-person presentation, {{the game}} has drawn {{comparisons}} to Konami's cancelled Silent Hills title and its P.T. demo. Capcom responded to this {{by pointing out that}} Resident Evil 7 was in development long before the reveal of P.T., and dispelled any rumors about staff of P.T. having been hired to work on the game. Shacknews noted that Beginning Hour had several similarities with Sweet Home (1989), the Capcom horror game that inspired the original Resident Evil (1996). These similarities to Sweet Home include the plot of a film crew <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> abandoned house, a paranormal female presence in the house, and a tragic tale involving a family that once lived there. Eurogamer found the element of survival horror in Lantern to be reminiscent of [...] Resident Evil 7 was well received for the dissimilarity to its polarizing predecessor, in particular the change from action-oriented combat and effects to an approach more grounded in horror.|$|E

500|$|Music {{supervisor}} Ivan Pavlovich said [...] " [...] to {{pick the}} songs that make New York today what it is, but make sure they won't feel dated {{by the time the}} game comes out." [...] The developers contacted over 2,000 people in order to obtain recording and publishing rights. They even hired a private investigator to locate the relatives of late Skatt Bros. member Sean Delaney to license the band's song [...] "Walk the Night". Citing sources close to the deals, Billboard reported that Rockstar paid as much as $5,000 per composition and another $5,000 per master recording per track. Developers originally considered letting players purchase music by <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> in-game record shop and for Niko to have an MP3 player, but both ideas were cut. DJ Green Lantern produced tracks exclusively for the game's hip-hop radio station The Beat 102.7.

500|$|Towards {{the end of}} 1991, Sub Pop {{gave the}} group $1000 to record the July 1992 entry in the labels singles club series.

The tracks were not successful with only [...] "Promise of Love" [...] being usable. Engle noted that Codeine desired the song to be loud {{on both sides of}} the single, but could not get the song [...] "Jr" [...] to come together. The group had already gone through most of their budget for recording, which led to the group <b>going</b> <b>to</b> <b>an</b> eight-track studio in the Boston suburb of Allston.

The group met up again to work in early 1992 towards their second LP (Long playing record) The White Birch, with recording commencing in June at Harold Dessau Recording at 25 Murray Street in Manhattan. At the studio, the group attempted to record versions of [...] "Realize", [...] "Jr", [...] "Tom", [...] "Wird" [...] "Smoking Room", [...] "Barely Real", [...] "Something New" [...] and [...] "Sea" [...] within a months time. Immerwahr was not content with the tracks, noting several issues such as: his own vocals, his desire to record music with even slower tempos, and the presence of high pitched noises in the songs that no one else could hear. On attempting to fix a broken toilet at the studio, Immerwahr accidentally flooded the clothing store below the studio.|$|E
