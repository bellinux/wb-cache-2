25|$|I invited Joss Whedon {{to lunch}} after I did the {{business}} deal with Fox. We'd had a cool {{relationship in the}} past and I so wanted to do something else, and I wanted to get back into a television show. I had him on the brain for sure but I hadn't called him yet, but I sort of took a leap of faith and set things up with Fox and then called Joss. We went to a four-hour lunch where I just sort of used my womanly wiles. No, we've become such good friends, kind of like brother and sister and kind of like he was my watcher, my handler <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first moved out to L.A. when I was 17 and I {{was a little bit of}} a wild child. He's watched me and helped me and taught me over the years. I told him how bad I wanted and needed him back and he accepted and here we are.|$|E
500|$|Gallagher {{has spoken}} about his {{political}} views on several occasions, most notably {{when he visited}} Tony Blair at No. 10 Downing Street in 1997. In an interview in 1997 {{when he was asked}} about why he visited Blair he replied, [...] "I've taken a lot of flack for going to No. 10 Downing Street but the thing about that is, I never considered myself a rebel anyway. I wasn't going there representing the 'Indie community'. I wasn't representing anyone. I was going there for me. You have to understand that <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> went to school and <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was born all we ever knew was conservative, Tory, right-wing government. What people don't mention is, they say 'He went to meet Tony Blair.' No. I went to meet the Labour prime minister. Our parents always drummed into us that the Labour Party was for the people and the Tory Party was not. I went to meet the Labour prime minister." ...|$|E
500|$|The {{episode was}} filmed {{on a set}} {{constructed}} at Studio D in the BBC Elstree Centre, run by BBC Studioworks, and authentic 1970s costumes and props were rented for the filming. The studio was retrofitted with cameras and lighting equipment {{that would have been}} used on a 1970s set, including three Ikegami HK 323 cameras and a single Ikegami HK323P camera, all provided by a company called Golden Age Recreations. The filming of the episode thus differed from the series's usual single-camera setup approach. Adam Tandy, Inside No. 9 producer, said that [...] "Studio D has the heritage and familiar atmosphere that I remember <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> worked at Elstree in the 1980s; however, a lot of modernisation has taken place since then and this has allowed us to monitor our 4:3 625-line PAL pictures in BBC Studioworks' state of the art HD production gallery." [...] For Shearsmith, the result was that [...] "it looks shit, but it's brilliant".|$|E

It {{was one of the}} quiet, colorful afternoons of sheer beauty which we have in October in New England, and as I looked towards the fields at the east, I imagined how wonderful it would be to make some device which had even the possibility of ascending to Mars.

2500|$|Speaking of the {{thinking}} behind titling the album 'Pulse', Braxton explained to UK R writer Pete Lewis – Deputy Editor of Blues & Soul – in May 2010: [...] "It comes <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> got ill. I went into cardic rehab, {{and there was}} this older lady there. She was like 'What are you doing here so young? It must have been your heart. You know what? This is my fourth heart-attack and you're so young, you can't be AFRAID! You can't stop LIVING!'... Then she told me how she'd just got back from holiday with her 40-year-old boyfriend! And because I'd lost hope – the doctors had told me I'd never be able to record again – her conversation was like that heartbeat, that pulse that gave me back the love of life." ...|$|E
2500|$|Hirsh was {{expected}} to be in the starting rotation in 2008, as the number 4 starter. But he found himself on the disabled list after just two scoreless innings in one spring training game, and started the season on the DL because of a strained muscle in his right rotator cuff and right rotator cuff inflammation. [...] While on the DL, Hirsh spent a number of weeks in a strengthening program and at extended spring training in Tucson, Arizona, to rebuild his arm strength. [...] "This is the first time I've ever really had injuries," [...] Hirsh said. [...] "I had maybe one injury in the minor leagues coming up. Throughout my career, <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was a little kid, I've never had arm problems, I've never broken a bone, I've never rolled an ankle. But I've managed to do all three of those in the last two years." ...|$|E
2500|$|Ram {{was trained}} by Ronen Moralli at the Israel Tennis Centers in Jerusalem. [...] "My first {{inspiration}} was Jo Jo Lizmi, the famous Jerusalem tennis coach, who showed {{me all the}} basic techniques. I was with him {{four or five years}} and he taught me everything – how to hold the racket, forehand, and backhand. He was very tough." [...] "But the man who really developed my game was Ronen Moralli", says Ram. [...] "He was with me in Jerusalem <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> was 10 years old, but then he moved to Wingate as the national coach." [...] Moralli recalls: [...] "When I worked with Andy at the Jerusalem Tennis Center he was very very energetic and full of passion. [...] His technical abilities weren't as good as the other kids, but he had an understanding of the game. It was something spectacular. [...] He knew when to come to the net, when to stay back. [...] This is something you are born with. [...] Either you have it or you don't. [...] You can teach it, but only up to a certain point, and Andy was born with it." ...|$|E

2500|$|Criticisms of the CoT {{began with}} its first tests, with the {{magazine}} Speedway Illustrated noting the car's {{poor performance in}} traffic (February 2006 issue). [...] The Winston-Salem Journal also noted extensive criticism of the project during 2006 testing, with drivers becoming more vocal by July 2007 and most fans rejecting the model, citing the falsity of many of its technical claims; one angle of criticism was the differing philosophies of NASCAR officials Gary Nelson and John Darby, with Darby a particularly ardent supporter of the CoT based on a misreading of the sport's competition packages. Jeff Gordon and Matt Kenseth were pointedly critical of the car's poor performance in traffic, with Gordon stating after the 2007 New England 300, [...] "I'd like to {{know who it was}} who said this car would reduce the aero push because I could have told you <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> first drove this car that it would be worse." [...] Kyle Busch, who won the very first race with the car at Bristol in 2007, proclaimed that the car [...] "sucks" [...] afterward and expanded on this criticism at Dover in 2008 in noting how the CoT was [...] "hitting a wall of air" [...] {{in the wake of a}} leading car, thus neutralizing ability to close up on leaders.|$|E
2500|$|Obviously, such a {{character}} discrepancy {{can create a}} problem for productions of the play. As {{an example of one}} way in which productions can resolve the problem, in Act 1, Scene 1 of the 1981 BBC Shakespeare adaptation, Montague is not present in either the persona of Salisbury or that of John Neville. As such, his first two lines, [...] "Good brother, as thou lov'st and honour'st arms,/Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus" [...] (ll.117–118), are reassigned to Clarence and altered to [...] "Set it on your head good father/If thou lov'st and honour'st arms,/Let's fight it out and not stand cavilling thus." [...] Montague's second line, [...] "And I unto the sea <b>from</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> came" [...] (l.210), is entirely absent. As {{a character}}, Montague is then introduced in Act 1, Scene 2, played by Michael Byrne (as he is {{for the rest of the}} production). His first line in this scene however, [...] "But I have reasons strong and forcible" [...] (l.3) is reassigned to Clarence. Later, when York is giving his men instructions, his order to Montague, [...] "Brother, thou shalt to London presently" [...] (l.36) is changed to [...] "Cousin, thou shalt to London presently", and York's reiteration of the order [...] "My brother Montague shall post to London" [...] (l.54) is changed to [...] "Hast you to London my cousin Montague." [...] Additionally, Montague's [...] "Brother, I go, I'll win them, fear it not" [...] (l.60) is changed to [...] "Cousin, I go, I'll win them, fear it not." [...] This all serves to establish a single figure who is York's cousin and Warwick's brother (i.e. John Neville).|$|E

60|$|The {{adoption}} of the Constitution and its attendant history led the people to believe so; and that such was the belief of {{the framers of the}} Constitution itself, why did those old men, about the time of the {{adoption of}} the Constitution, decree that slavery should not go into the new Territory, where it had not already gone? Why declare that within twenty years the African slave trade, by which slaves are supplied, might be cut off by Congress? Why were all these acts? I might enumerate more of these acts; but enough. What were they but a clear indication that the framers of the Constitution intended and expected the ultimate extinction of that institution? And now, when I say, as I said in my speech that Judge Douglas has quoted <b>from,</b> <b>when</b> <b>I</b> say that I think the opponents of slavery will resist the farther spread of it, and place it where the public mind shall rest with the belief that it is in course of ultimate extinction, I only mean to say that they will place it where the founders of this government originally placed it.|$|E
