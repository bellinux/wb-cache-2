The approach was to evaluate differences in the rates of strength build-up and in the vari-abili ty of sustained lifting <b>exertions</b> performed by three groups of sub-jects. These groups included healthy subjects performing maximal exer-tions, healthy subjects performing submaximal <b>exertions</b> and symptomatic subjects with low back pain performing safe maximal <b>exertions.</b> The rate of strength build-up reliably distinguished between maximal and submaximal <b>exertions</b> while the ratio of within-trial variability to strength score differed significantly between the healthy and injured groups.

40|$|Manual muscle tests (MMTs) are {{frequently}} used in clinical settings {{to evaluate a}} specific muscle’s function and strength in a position at which this muscle {{is believed to be}} most isolated from other synergists and antagonists. It is necessary for a muscle to be tested in a state of isolation (as much as is physiologically possible), as interpretation of strength and function can be compromised by the contributions of other active muscles. In the present study, electromyographic activation of 14 shoulder muscles was assessed in 12 males during 29 shoulder <b>exertions.</b> Maximal isolation ratios defined which of these <b>exertions</b> most isolated the rotator cuff muscles. Results confirmed the appropriateness of nine clinical MMTs in isolating the rotator cuff muscles, but suggested that several other <b>exertions</b> were equally appropriate in isolating these muscles.

40|$|Hand {{force and}} posture are key {{determinants}} of body loads during standing hand-force <b>exertions.</b> Current digital human modeling tools lack validated posture prediction algorithms and assume the force requested {{is representative of}} the actual hand force. Furthermore, a change in hand force is not reflected in the simulated task posture. To address this need, a three-dimensional whole-body posture-prediction model was developed based on the following general biomechanical hypothesis: People choose postures that maintain shoulder moments below a threshold, and minimize lower-back torsion, while maintaining their torso orientation near vertical. To tune and validate the model, posture data were gathered from nineteen men and women in a laboratory study of force <b>exertions</b> with one and two hands. Participants exerted maximum forces and 25 %, 50 %, and 75 % of maximum at three handle heights. The <b>exertions</b> included pushes, pulls, and vertical up/down <b>exertions</b> against a stationary handle. Posture and force data were analyzed for use in a hybrid biomechanical/empirical model formulation. The off-axis forces that were observed were consistent with participants reducing shoulder moment and increasing ground reaction force to improve foot traction. Shoulder flexion/extension moments were {{less than or equal to}} 37 Nm in 90 % of trials, regardless of hand force magnitude and direction. Pelvis location and orientation during one-hand <b>exertions</b> support the hypothesis that postures are selected to reduce rotational moments about the lumbar spine. A tradeoff between torso inclination and change in shoulder position with increasing hand force was observed for <b>exertions</b> performed at a mid-thigh handle-height. Across both one- and two-handed <b>exertions,</b> shoulder flexion/extension moment was found to be well predicted with an adjusted R 2 value of 0. 82 and 0. 92, and root mean square error (RMSE) of 10. 7 Nm and 5. 48 Nm for one- and two-handed trials, respectively. The resulting posture-prediction model showed good performance for push/pull <b>exertions.</b> For up/down <b>exertions,</b> the wide range of tactics demonstrated by the study participants limited the model performance. Agreement between observed and predicted postural metrics was good when validated against 20 % of trials withheld from the original dataset, with correlation coefficients ranging from 0. 847 to 0. 531 for all <b>exertions...</b>|$|R

The bay at the northeastern side of the building was removed. Additionally, the roof suffered complete destruction. As a result, Lake Worth was without a functional center for city government. A temporary city hall was established at the Lauriston building. Damage in Lake Worth reached approximately $4million. Three deaths occurred in Lake Worth, two from illnesses related to exposure to the storm; the other was a man who suffered from apoplexy, blamed on excessive <b>exertion</b> {{in the aftermath of the}} hurricane.|$|E
5|$|Blackouts in {{freediving}} {{can occur}} when the breath is held long enough for metabolic activity to reduce the oxygen partial pressure sufficiently to cause loss of consciousness. This is accelerated by <b>exertion,</b> which uses oxygen faster, or by hyperventilation, which reduces the carbon dioxide level in the blood. Lower carbon dioxide levels increase the oxygen-haemoglobin affinity, reducing availability of oxygen to brain tissue {{towards the end of}} the dive (Bohr effect); they also suppress the urge to breathe, making it easier to hold the breath to the point of blackout. This can happen at any depth.|$|E

5|$|Sing {{returned}} to Australia on submarine guard duty in late July 1918. An army medical report from 23 November 1918 {{noted that he}} had gunshot wounds in the left shoulder, back, and left leg, and had suffered gas poisoning. The report stated that his general health was 'good' but that he complained of coughing upon <b>exertion.</b> It recognised that Sing's disability {{were the result of}} service, was permanent, and recommended that he be discharged as permanently unfit for service. Following his departure from the army, he briefly turned his hand to sheep farming, but the land he was given was of poor quality. He then worked as a gold miner.|$|E
5|$|The {{scientist}} Tolley {{aimed to}} establish the manpower needed to haul the vessels over the isthmus ridge. Assuming that a trireme soaked with water weighed 38 tons including its trolley, and that a man can exert a force of 300N {{over an extended period}} of time, the pulling teams—depending on the slope and the surface of the cart track—must have numbered between 112 and 142 people, with a combined <b>exertion</b> of force of 33 to 42kN, or around 3.8 tons weight. Bringing the trolley up to speed may have required as many as 180 men. Assuming a speed of 2km per hour over an estimated length of 6kilometres, the transfer from sea to sea would have taken three hours to complete.|$|E
5|$|These {{advantages}} {{offset the}} high stress, physical <b>exertion</b> costs, and other {{risks of the}} migration. Predation can be heightened during migration: Eleonora's falcon Falco eleonorae, which breeds on Mediterranean islands, has a very late breeding season, coordinated with the autumn passage of southbound passerine migrants, which it feeds to its young. A similar strategy is adopted by the greater noctule bat, which preys on nocturnal passerine migrants. The higher concentrations of migrating birds at stopover sites make them prone to parasites and pathogens, which require a heightened immune response.|$|E
40|$|Few {{studies have}} {{investigated}} the neuromuscular recruitment and stabilizing control of the spine during pushing and pulling <b>exertions.</b> Past theoretical investigation suggest that co-contraction of the of the paraspinal muscles is necessary to stabilize the spine during pushing <b>exertions.</b> We hypothesized greater levels of co-contraction during pushing <b>exertions.</b> Co-contraction of trunk musculature was quantified during isometric pushing and pulling tasks. The mean value of co-contraction during pushing was two-fold greater (p < 0. 01) than during extension.

5|$|Accelerated {{deposition}} of cholesterol {{in the walls}} of arteries leads to atherosclerosis, the underlying cause of cardiovascular disease. The most common problem in FH {{is the development of}} coronary artery disease (atherosclerosis of the coronary arteries that supply the heart) at a much younger age than would be expected in the general population. This may lead to angina pectoris (chest pain or tightness on <b>exertion)</b> or heart attacks. Less commonly, arteries of the brain are affected; this may lead to transient ischemic attacks (brief episodes of weakness {{on one side of the}} body or inability to talk) or occasionally stroke. Peripheral artery occlusive disease (obstruction of the arteries of the legs) occurs mainly in people with FH who smoke; this can cause pain in the calf muscles during walking that resolves with rest (intermittent claudication) and problems due to a decreased blood supply to the feet (such as gangrene).|$|E
5|$|DuMont {{aspired to}} grow beyond its three stations, {{applying}} for new television station licenses in Cincinnati and Cleveland in 1947. This {{would give the}} network five owned-and-operated stations (O), the maximum allowed by the FCC at the time. However, DuMont was hampered by Paramount's two stations, KTLA (channel 5) in Los Angeles and WBKB (channel 4, now WBBM-TV on channel 2) in Chicago – {{the descendants of the}} two experimental stations that rankled DuMont in 1940. Although these stations did not carry DuMont programming (with the exception of KTLA for one year from 1947 to 1948), and in fact competed against DuMont's affiliates in those cities, the FCC ruled that Paramount essentially controlled DuMont, which effectively placed the network at the five-station cap. Paramount's <b>exertion</b> of influence over the network's management and the power of its voting stock brought the FCC to its conclusion. Thus, DuMont was unable to open additional stations as long as Paramount owned stations or owned a portion of DuMont. Paramount refused to sell.|$|E
5|$|In total, the Australians {{had about}} 2,292 {{personnel}} including {{those from the}} 53rd Infantry Battalion, positioned further back from Isurava, as well as support units including the 14th and 2/6th Field Ambulances, the Australian New Guinea Administrative Unit, the Royal Papuan Constabulary and the PIB. These troops were beginning to experience the strain of the jungle warfare: limited rations, inadequate personal equipment, harsh conditions and physical <b>exertion</b> were all beginning to sap their strength and instances of disease were beginning to decrease their effectiveness in the harsh terrain they were being asked to defend. At this stage the Australians' limited artillery resources were concentrated around Port Moresby, and due to difficulties in moving the guns forward along the track, the Australian defenders were without artillery support. Instead, the Australians had one 3-inch mortar, which was brought up to Isurava by the 2/14th Battalion part way through the battle after it was airdropped at Myola on 27 August.|$|E

The attack was supported by a mountain gun and mortars that had been manhandled up the track. As the first wave fell on the position, the Australians sought to conceal their positions as best they could, firing as late as possible. Humidity and physical <b>exertion</b> sapped the strength of the attacking Japanese and the initial assault was held. That night, as heavy rain fell, the assault on the 39th around Isurava resumed, with a force penetrating the Australian positions around the abandoned garden.|$|E
5|$|Most Pokémon {{evolve into}} other forms when certain {{conditions}} are met, {{such as when}} they reach a certain level—levels range from 1 to 100—or have a certain item used on them. They can learn up to four moves, including attacking moves, healing moves, and moves that inflict status conditions on the opponent. They have six stats that affect battle performance: maximum HP (hit points), Attack, Defense, Special Attack, Special Defense, and Speed. Attack and Special Attack are distinguished from Defense and Special Defense by the types of moves being considered: generally, moves involving physical <b>exertion</b> are physical, while moves involving supernatural or elemental powers are special. Moves are classed as one of seventeen types, (Normal, Water, Grass, Fire, Electric, Ghost, Bug, Fighting, Ice, Steel, Rock, Poison, Psychic, Dark, Dragon, Ground, and Flying); Pokémon can {{have one or two}} types. Generally, most of a Pokémon's moves correspond to its typing. A Pokémon's type makes it vulnerable or resistant to others; for example, Fire-type Pokémon are weak to Water-type moves, while Grass-type moves do little damage to them and Electric-type moves do normal damage.|$|E
5|$|The {{weakness}} from LEMS typically {{involves the}} muscles of the proximal arms and legs (the muscles closer to the trunk). In contrast to myasthenia gravis, the weakness affects the legs more than the arms. This leads to difficulties climbing stairs and rising from a sitting position. Weakness is often relieved temporarily after <b>exertion</b> or physical exercise. High temperatures can worsen the symptoms. Weakness of the bulbar muscles (muscles of the mouth and throat) is occasionally encountered. Weakness of the eye muscles is uncommon. Some may have double vision, drooping of the eyelids and difficulty swallowing, but generally only together with leg weakness; this too distinguishes LEMS from myasthenia gravis, in which eye signs are much more common. In the advanced stages of the disease, weakness of the respiratory muscles may occur. Some may also experience problems with coordination (ataxia).|$|E
