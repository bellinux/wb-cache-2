According to a persistent myth, Reed no-showed a set of TV tapings where he was booked to win the title, resulting in the championship instead being put on The Honky Tonk Man. However, in a shoot interview, Reed has said this is untrue. In fact, when the Honky Tonk Man won the title from Steamboat in June 1987, Reed was shown celebrating with Honky and other heel wrestlers {{in the locker room}} although, <b>in</b> <b>fairness,</b> that was a taped segment.|$|E
25|$|British Intelligence did {{not predict}} {{the scale of}} Georgette, {{although}} <b>in</b> <b>fairness</b> the Germans were changing their plans frequently and only finalised their intentions {{a week or so}} beforehand. The Germans enjoyed significant artillery superiority (although less than they would have preferred after the intense fighting in the Somme sector) and some of the BEF line was held by poor-quality Portuguese divisions. Foch visited Haig at 1pm on 9 April, and again refused Haig’s demand that the French take over more BEF line so as to free up a British reserve. Haig felt that Foch’s proposal to deploy 4 French divisions west of Amiens would simply increase Rawlinson’s logistical troubles without doing much to help. On 10 April Georgette was extended northwards, as von Arnim’s Fourth Army also attacked, forcing the evacuation of Armentieres by Du Cane’s XV Corps. Haig yet again demanded that the French take over “some portion” of the British line and give French assistance “in order … to continue the battle”.|$|E

The AAFC did not start play until after the war, however, and Brown continued {{to get ready for}} the 1945 season at Great Lakes. That year, many of his best players were transferred to bases on the West Coast as the focus of the war shifted to the Pacific. The team started with a 0–4–1 record, but rattled off six straight wins after the war ended and players returned from service overseas.

His confidants knew this and in many situations took advantage of Grant's presidential authority.

[...] Grant himself, far from being politically naive, had played a shrewd hand at times in the protection of cabinet and appointees. Examples include not allowing Benjamin Bristow to move the Tax Revenue Supervisors and relinquishing immunity in the Whiskey Ring cases, made Grant a protector of political patronage. <b>In</b> <b>fairness,</b> Grant did appoint cabinet reformers and special prosecutors that were able to clean up the Treasury, Interior, War, and Justice departments.

500|$|McBride {{first set}} his sights on Notre Dame's Frank Leahy as his team's head coach, and the two men shook hands on a deal to make him coach and general manager. Not wanting to lose Leahy, however, Notre Dame's {{president}} objected and McBride backed off. He then asked Cleveland Plain Dealer sportswriter John Dietrich who he should hire. Dietrich suggested Paul Brown, the Ohio State Buckeyes coach who was then serving in the U.S. Navy and coaching a team at the Great Lakes Naval Training Station outside of Chicago. With his limited football knowledge, McBride had never heard of Brown, and it was Ward who made the initial approach. McBride later met with Brown, whose star was on the rise after bringing Ohio State its first national championship in 1942, and offered him $17,500 a year ($ in current dollar terms) – the biggest salary for any football coach at any level – and an ownership stake in the team. He also offered Brown a stipend {{for the rest of his}} time in the military.
