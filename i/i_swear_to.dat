500|$|Larry Geller became Presley's hairdresser in 1964. Unlike {{others in}} the Memphis Mafia, he was {{interested}} in spiritual questions and recalls how, from their first conversation, Presley revealed his secret thoughts and anxieties: [...] "I mean {{there has to be a}} purpose... there's got to be a reason... why I was chosen to be Elvis Presley.... <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> God, no one knows how lonely I get. And how empty I really feel." [...] Thereafter, Geller supplied him with books on religion and mysticism, which the singer read voraciously. Presley would be preoccupied by such matters for much of his life, taking trunkloads of books with him on tour.|$|E

500|$|News {{footage of}} then-President Bill Clinton was {{digitally}} altered {{to make it}} appear as if he is speaking about alien contact. This was not the original plan for the film; Zemeckis had initially approached Sidney Poitier to play the president, but the actor turned the role down in favor of The Jackal. Shortly after Poitier's refusal, Zemeckis saw a NASA announcement in August 1996. [...] "Clinton gave his Mars rock speech," [...] the director explained, [...] "and <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> God it was like it was scripted for this movie. When he said the line 'We will continue to listen closely to what it has to say,' I almost died. I stood there with my mouth hanging open." ...|$|E
500|$|In 1979, Gray {{spoke with}} TV Guide (Canada) and recounted: [...] "At first, {{they had no}} idea what to do with the part. Sue Ellen's lines ran to 'More coffee, darling?' and 'I have a headache.' Victoria Principal and Patrick Duffy were the goody-goodies. Jim Davis and Barbara Bel Geddes were parental. Hagman was the villain. And I was the redhead on the couch." [...] However, Gray was {{upgraded}} to a starring role once Dallas was picked up for a full season following the five episode arc miniseries. The actress later stated that on-screen husband Larry Hagman had criticized one of her performances early on during the start of the series, and called it [...] "terrible", though he denied it. She joked, [...] "I'm sorry. He said it to me loud and clear, and made me feel terrible, and it started one of our first fights on the way back [...] <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> you—he devastated me. Then, years later, he said, 'Oh, I didn't mean that.' I could have killed him!" ...|$|E
500|$|During {{the next}} few months, Pedro {{attempted}} to maintain a semblance of unity with Portugal, but the final rupture was impending. Aided by an able minister, José Bonifácio de Andrada, he searched for support outside Rio de Janeiro. The prince traveled to Minas Gerais in April and on to São Paulo in August. He was welcomed warmly in both Brazilian provinces, and the visits reinforced his authority. While returning from São Paulo, he received news sent on 7 September that the Cortes would not accept self-governance in Brazil and would punish all who disobeyed its orders. [...] "Never one to eschew the most dramatic action on the immediate impulse", said Barman about the prince, he [...] "required no more time for decision than {{the reading of the}} letters demanded." [...] Pedro mounted his bay mare and, in front of his entourage and his Guard of Honor, said: [...] "Friends, the Portuguese Cortes wished to enslave and persecute us. As of today our bonds are ended. By my blood, by my honor, by my God, <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> bring about the independence of Brazil. Brazilians, let our watchword from this day forth be 'Independence or Death! ...|$|E

500|$|Mary Macnamara of the Los Angeles Times has {{praised the}} {{character}} highly, writing: [...] "Hahn {{is a terrific}} character, sassy and professional, with an appropriately acerbic view of the various romantic shenanigans. She {{also seems to be}} a carefully considered stand-in for viewers choking on the soapy silt of last season, a way for the writers to move forward without messing with the hugely successful brand. (Don’t get too nervous, Brooke, but the future of TV's once highest-rated drama may be in your hands.)" [...] Discussing the character in terms of her relationship with Callie Torres, AfterEllen.com were also largely positive, assessing that: [...] "The story line offered both the drama Grey's is known for and— despite some marginally exploitative threesome talk— a truthfulness network television has rarely achieved when it comes to lesbian relationships." [...] Trish Doolan and Nikki Weiss, invited by GLAAD to consult with Grey's Anatomy producers on the storyline, praised the effort put into researching the issue by the writers and actors involved, though were more negative on the scene which saw Hahn kiss Callie in an elevator in front of Mark Sloan. Weiss commented: [...] "I just felt like, if they really cared about each other, I don't think they would do that as a stunt. That seemed a little, I don't know, forced. [...] was more like a conquest, like he could have [...] too or something." [...] AfterEllen.com agreed with this view, criticizing the way the scene was edited so as to keep cutting to Mark's point of view, as though [...] "privileging the male gaze." [...] Smith, however, has refuted this interpretation, stating that; [...] "Frankly, when I played that scene, I played it as, [...] "You think that if you walked in the room and we were together, we would just be on you, but we wouldn't." [...] So that's why I kissed her. In that moment, <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> God, when I was playing it, that's what I was thinking. You know there's a bit of a competition between all the guys in the boys club and my character anyway, so when that happened it was sort of like, [...] "Oh yeah, you wouldn't be intimidated, uh huh. OK, well, check this out." ...|$|E
2500|$|The {{basic unit}} of the party is a cell of five members, the leader of which is called a mushrif. The mushrif leads a study-circle and supervises its members study the HT ideology, {{listening}} to readings from books by the party’s founder, Nabhani, particularly Nidham al-Islam, or the System of Islam, which [...] "lays out Nabhani’s vision of an `Islamic` state" [...] and [...] "refutes" [...] other Arab political ideologies. Where the party is not legal, only the mushrif knows the names of members of other cells.

In [...] the Western countries, members who have jobs contribute part of their income, [...] "possibly as much as 10 percent". In Muslim countries funding may or may not come from [...] "from Iran, the Gulf States and Saudi Arabia".|$|E

His gun was pointed on Sterling, who had a gunshot wound in his chest. The officers retrieved a loaded [...]38 caliber revolver from Sterling's front pants pocket. The officers then radioed for Emergency Medical Services.|$|E

Bassist Jeff Ament said, [...] "I {{know it was}} a great song all along, and I felt that it was the best song that we got the worst take of on the first record. There were a hundred takes on that song, and we just never nailed it." [...] Drummer Dave Krusen said, [...] "I was pretty green back then and 'Even Flow' suffered from too much fluctuation." [...] He added that [...] "it was really tough for me. I don't know why. Not sure why we didn't use that one from the demo as well, but I know it felt better." [...] Guitarist Mike McCready stated, [...] "We did 'Even Flow' about 50, 70 times. <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> God it was a nightmare. We played that thing over and over until we hated each other. I still don't think Stone is satisfied with how it came out." ...|$|E
2500|$|Both groups {{convinced}} the Prince {{not to return}} to Portugal, and he replied on 9 January 1822: [...] "Since {{it is for the}} good of all and the general happiness of the Nation, I am willing. Tell the people that I am staying."" [...] He appointed José Bonifácio, leader of the Luso-Brazilians, as head of the Cabinet on 18 January 1822. Pedro traveled to São Paulo province to secure its loyalty to the Brazilian cause, but he received a letter from Bonifácio as he was returning to Rio de Janeiro on 7 September. The prince learned that the Cortes had annulled the remaining powers he had retained. Pedro turned to his companions, who included his Guard of Honor and said: [...] "Friends, the Portuguese Cortes wants to enslave and pursue us. From today onward our relations are broken. No ties unites us any longer". Pulling off his blue and white armband which symbolized Portugal, he continued: [...] "Armbands off, soldiers. Hail to independence, to freedom and to the separation of Brazil". In a moment which would become the most iconic in Brazilian history, he unsheathed his sword and affirmed that [...] "For my blood, my honor, my God, <b>I</b> <b>swear</b> <b>to</b> give Brazil freedom", and then cried out: [...] "Independence or death!" ...|$|E
