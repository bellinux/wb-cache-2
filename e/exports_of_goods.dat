Models are created by cointegration analysis. The advantage of cointegration analysis and error correction models is avoiding spurious regression and differentiation of short-term and long-term relations. There will be used two attitudes for creation of models: with help of ADL models and Johansen method, which serve to comparison of results.

Subsequently, the legal regulation is compared to <b>export</b> legal regulation <b>of</b> WTO. The aim of this comparison is to find out, whether there are any conflicts between EU and WTO regulations. Hypothesis consists of two thoughts: a) Legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> {{as a part of}} EU common trade policy is embedded in EU law in detail. <b>Export</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> is regulated (special) or banned in comparison to the regular export regime in certain cases; b) EU legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> is in compliance with WTO legal regulation <b>of</b> <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods.</b> The descriptive, analytical (in part related to EU legal regulation) and comparative (in part related to WTO export regulation) methods were used when verifying the hypothesis. The thesis consists of two main parts. The first one aims to describe and analyze the EU common trade policy in relation to <b>export</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and its display in primary and secondary law. The aspects of common trade policy as an external activity is described as well. Based on this analysis, the thesis concludes that hypothesis "a) " is true and [...] ...|$|R
25|$|Real GDP grew by 3.8% in 2010 and 3.2% in 2011, {{boosted by}} rising {{worldwide}} nickel prices {{and an increase}} in domestic demand due to rising employment, as well as strong business investments. In 2011, <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services from New Caledonia amounted to 2.11billion US dollars, 75.6% of which were mineral products and alloys (mainly nickel ore and ferronickel). Imports of goods and services amounted to 5.22billion US dollars. 22.1% of the imports of goods came from Metropolitan France and its overseas departments, 16.1% from other countries in the European Union, 14.6% from Singapore (essentially fuel), 9.6% from Australia, 4.5% from the United States, 4.2% from New Zealand, 2.0% from Japan, and 27.0% from other countries. The trade deficit in goods and services stood at 3.11 billion US dollars in 2011.|$|E
25|$|After 1950 {{the country}} {{suffered}} economic disruptions {{about once a}} decade; the most serious crisis occurred in the late 1970s. In each case, an industry-led period of rapid expansion, marked by {{a sharp increase in}} imports, resulted in a balance of payments crisis. Devaluations of the Turkish lira and austerity programs designed to dampen domestic demand for foreign goods were implemented in accordance with International Monetary Fund guidelines. These measures usually led to sufficient improvement in the country's external accounts to make possible the resumption of loans to Turkey by foreign creditors. Although the military interventions of 1960 and 1971 were prompted in part by economic difficulties, after each intervention Turkish politicians boosted government spending, causing the economy to overheat. In the absence of serious structural reforms, Turkey ran chronic current account deficits usually financed by external borrowing that made the country's external debt rise from decade to decade, reaching by 1980 about US$16.2 billion, or more than one-quarter of annual gross domestic product. Debt-servicing costs in that year equaled 33 percent of <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> and services.|$|E
500|$|The {{original}} settlement {{may have}} been at the Iron Age fort Daw's Castle. It then moved to the mouth of the river and a small harbour developed, named by the celts as [...] "Gwo Coed" [...] meaning Under the Wood. [...] After the Saxon conquest of the area the town developed and was known as Weced or Waeced [...] and was attacked by Vikings in the 10th century. Trade using the harbour gradually grew, despite damage during several severe storms, with import and <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods</b> including those from Wansbrough Paper Mill until the 19th century when it increased with the export of iron ore, brought from the Brendon Hills via the West Somerset Mineral Railway, mainly to Newport for onward transportation to the Ebbw Vale Steelworks. The West Somerset Railway also served the town and port bringing goods and people from the Bristol and Exeter Railway. The iron ore trade reduced and ceased in the early-20th century. The port continued a smaller commercial trade until 2000 when it was converted into a marina.|$|E

6000|$|Out of this, {{and out of}} <b>exports</b> <b>of</b> <b>goods,</b> and {{payments}} in kind under the Treaty prior to May, 1921 (for which I have not as yet made any allowance), the Allies have held out {{the hope that they}} will allow Germany to receive back such sums for the purchase of necessary food and raw materials as the former deem it essential for her to have. It is not possible at the present time to form an accurate judgment either as to the money-value of the goods which Germany will require to purchase from abroad in order to re-establish her economic life, or as to the degree of liberality with which the Allies will exercise their discretion. If her stocks of raw materials and food were to be restored to anything approaching their normal level by May, 1921, Germany would probably require foreign purchasing power of from $500,000,000 to $1,000,000,000 at least, in addition to the value of her current exports. While this {{is not likely to be}} permitted, I venture to assert as a matter beyond reasonable dispute that the social and economic condition of Germany cannot possibly permit a surplus of exports over imports during the period prior to May, 1921, and that the value of any {{payments in}} kind with which she may be able to furnish the Allies under the Treaty in the form of coal, dyes, timber, or other materials will have to be returned to her to enable her to pay for imports essential to her existence.[126] ...|$|E
