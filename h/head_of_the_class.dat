40|$|O presente trabalho tem como objeto de estudo a liderança e gestão de uma escola sob o ponto de vista dos diretores de turma, questionando estes acerca da promoção do sucesso escolar dos alunos. O sucesso escolar dos alunos tem sido uma temática amplamente discutida e está longe de reunir consensos, o que tem conduzido a sucessivas abordagens do tema. O sucesso escolar dos alunos depende de inúmeros fatores que vão além da própria iniciativa dos alunos. A motivação do seu desempenho é influenciado por fatores externos, sendo a liderança e a gestão dois deles. Assim, os diretores de turma, assumindo um papel de líderes e gestores no sistema escolar, desempenham um papel determinante nesta temática. O que se pretende indagar é, essencialmente, o que pensam os diretores de turma acerca da promoção do sucesso escolar dos alunos, que iniciativas tomam na senda dessa promoção, quais as boas práticas promotoras do sucesso escolar e que vertentes devem ser melhoradas. Mas entrevistamos cinco diretores de turma empenhados na sua função como fonte de inspiração e reflexão sobre o papel dos diretores de turma. The present work {{targets to}} study the {{leadership}} and management of a school, from <b>the</b> point <b>of</b> view <b>of</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classes,</b> querying about <b>the</b> promotion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. Being, academic success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students a theme of wide discussions and yet far away from consensus, is subjected to various approaches. <b>The</b> academic success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students depends upon innumerous factors, which goes beyond properly <b>the</b> initiatives <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students. <b>The</b> motivation <b>of</b> <b>the</b> performance <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classes</b> is influenced by many external factors, being leadership and management two <b>of</b> them. Thus, <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classes,</b> being leaders and managers in the school system, are protagonists of this thematic. Our investigation intends to investigate, essentially, what <b>the</b> <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classes</b> think about <b>the</b> promotion <b>of</b> <b>the</b> academic success <b>of</b> <b>the</b> students, what are their initiatives in this matter, their good practices for the promotion and yet what factors they need to improve. As <b>the</b> source <b>of</b> inspiration and reflection for this work we interviewed five committed <b>heads</b> <b>of</b> <b>the</b> <b>classes.</b> This report results from my Project for <b>the</b> Initiation <b>of</b> Supervised Practice, in <b>the</b> context <b>of</b> a Master’s degree in <b>the</b> Teaching <b>of</b> History and Geography in the 3 rd Cycle of Basic and Secondary Education, administered by <b>the</b> School <b>of</b> Education, Administration and Social Sciences at the Lusófona University for Humanities and Technology. Grounded {{on the belief that}} students transport previous ideas of historical and geographical knowledge into the classroom, which ensue from their personal experiences, this study of a qualitative nature is anchored on <b>the</b> constructivist line <b>of</b> thought and is inspired by the Grounded Theory research model so that, as the analysis is developed, the answers are conceptualised and the concepts grouped into categories. <b>The</b> sample consists <b>of</b> 24 students, aged between 13 and 15 years, who attend the 3 rd Cycle at the Secondary School. In the first phase, a questionnaire was presented to sound out the student’s previous ideas, without any access to consultation or anterior explanations by the teacher, before the coursework was taught. In the second phase, after the subject matter was taught, the same questionnaires were presented; these were then categorised with <b>the</b> purpose <b>of</b> evaluating <b>the</b> students progress <b>of</b> knowledge.
