50|$|The first {{example is}} a one-suit squeeze in which the victim can choosebetween an <b>endplay</b> or a simple promotion: If the five of {{diamonds}} is played, East must choose whether to discard the spade three or an intermediate honor.By throwing the three East chooses an endplay; South simply ducks a smallspade to East, who has to lead up to the king.By throwing an intermediate honor, East allows for a promotion of the eight;South leads the nine, West has to cover {{in order to avoid}} an <b>endplay</b> and theeight will eventually become master.Note that if the spade five and three were exchanged the squeeze still works.East can choose between an <b>endplay</b> to the king, or an <b>endplay</b> to the eight.|$|E
50|$|Also during Fall 2008, LIN TV and Fox Interactive Media {{developed}} a new Web CMS platform which would initially host the Web sites {{of all of the}} stations owned by LIN TV and those owned by Fox Television Stations. This division would be spun off in 2009 as the independent company Canvas Technology, which would change its name to <b>EndPlay</b> in 2010. With Fox Television Stations abandoning the <b>EndPlay</b> platform in favor of WorldNow during 2012, LIN TV will become EndPlay's largest client, followed by the E. W. Scripps Company (which adopted the <b>EndPlay</b> platform during 2010).|$|E
50|$|A strip squeeze is a declarer {{technique}} at contract bridge combining {{elements of}} squeeze and <b>endplay.</b>|$|E

50|$|A strip squeeze is a {{particular}} kind of squeeze that is based on <b>endplaying</b> the squeezed defender.|$|R
50|$|Declarer's now {{plays the}} king, ace, and queen of clubs, {{discarding}} a heart from dummy {{to reach the}} end position shown below: Declarer exits with a spade, and whoever wins is <b>endplayed.</b> If the defender leads a heart, North-South must make three heart tricks; if a club or diamond, declarer will ruff {{in one hand and}} discard a heart from the other, making an extra trump trick. Or if the defender has fewer than three clubs and chooses to ruff before the above position is reached, he is likewise <b>endplayed,</b> having to lead a heart or a diamond.|$|R
50|$|The {{peculiar}} {{and rare}} single-suit squeeze {{is actually a}} type of <b>endplay</b> rather than a real squeeze.|$|E
50|$|Smother play in {{contract}} {{bridge is}} a type of <b>endplay</b> where an opponent's apparent trump trick goes away.|$|E

50|$|The {{crocodile}} coup is {{a technique}} used by the defense. It is executed by second hand, following suit with a higher card than apparently necessary, to keep fourth hand from winning and thereby being <b>endplayed.</b>|$|R
5000|$|Free finesses often happen due to {{the defense}} {{guessing}} wrong about high cards in declarer's hand, especially on the opening lead. But {{it is also possible}} to force the defense to give you a free finesse, by <b>endplaying</b> them. Consider the two-way finesse example again, but with an additional card: ...|$|R
50|$|A winkle {{is a rare}} squeeze/endplay in {{contract}} {{bridge in}} which a trick is offered to the defenders but whichever wins the trick is then <b>endplayed.</b> Often one defender {{would be forced to}} offer a finesse or ruff and discard while the other could overtake and thereby promote a trick in that suit for declarer.|$|R
5000|$|A similar tactic {{can also}} be used to create an <b>endplay</b> situation, with similar results to the more {{ordinary}} trump coup: ...|$|E
50|$|And {{it would}} not have helped Helgemo to switch to a low heart at trick four. South wins West's Q with the A, leads the Q, covered and won, and then leads another heart to <b>endplay</b> Helgemo.|$|E
5000|$|Coffin wrote {{more than}} 200 books that {{included}} bridge, poker, cribbage and other card games. At the bridge table {{he was known}} for his exceptional <b>endplay</b> technique (eliminations, squeezes and coups) resulting in his nickname [...] "Endplays" [...] Coffin, after his classic books of the same title.He also wrote about fungi, on which he was an authority.|$|E
50|$|To win {{five of the}} six {{remaining}} tricks (one trick must be lost in any event, as the 9&thinsp;8 form a sure {{winner in}} the East hand), the 10 must be led from dummy and South must ruff with a low club (executing the grand coup in doing so). After this the A&thinsp;K must be cashed, and finally a low club led from hand. East can now win only one trump trick - if he takes this trick he will be <b>endplayed</b> into leading into South's remaining trump tenace and lose the last two tricks, while if he ducks, he will of course prosaically lose his 9 or 8 to South's J and win only trick 13.|$|R
50|$|South wins a trick less if {{he plays}} otherwise, as the tempo of the {{situation}} is altered and it will be South who becomes <b>endplayed</b> at trick 12 to give up a second trump winner to East - if he does not ruff dummy's heart winner, after giving up the first trump trick to East, the latter will still have a major suit card at trick 11 in addition to his two trumps, which he will lead to compel South to ruff and again lead trumps up to East. If he executes the coup but then fails to cash both spades before touching trumps, East will lead his remaining spade to force South back on lead to give up a second trump trick.|$|R
50|$|Here is {{a simple}} <b>endplay</b> situation: At no trump, South is on lead with three cards left to play. South ducks the 2 to West, who must now lead spades into South's ace-queen tenace and South wins two tricks. If South plays spades first, he wins {{only one of the}} last three tricks.This play is not really a duck, because it does not {{surrender}} a trick that could be won.|$|E
5000|$|For example, South is declarer in 6 and West {{leads the}} diamond king. If the adverse spades are divided 2-1, there are 12 certain tricks (six spade tricks, two hearts, one diamond and three clubs) and the {{possibility}} of a 13th by correctly guessing the two-way finesse (or dropping the queen) in hearts. But if the spades are 3-0, declarer will need an <b>endplay</b> to avoid the heart guess.|$|E
5000|$|West is on lead. If he cashes {{the high}} heart, a club is thrown from the dummy, and East is squeezed. Whichever card East discards, the declarer will take two tricks in that suit. Instead, West must lead a diamond {{to protect the}} partner from {{subsequent}} <b>endplay</b> (if he returns a club, the declarer will take the King and put East in with another club, forcing him to lead into AQ).|$|E
5000|$|On May 16, 2006, KTTV {{launched}} a new website based on Fox Television Stations' MyFox interface; this format became standard on the websites {{of each of the}} Fox-owned stations - and was even adopted by some of Fox's affiliates not owned by the network - {{by the end of that}} year (the [...] "MyFox" [...] branded websites were operated by former News Corporation subsidiary <b>EndPlay</b> until 2012, when the sites were migrated to the WorldNow platform).|$|E
50|$|By nature, {{backwash}} squeeze is a non-material trump squeeze {{without the}} count. It {{occurs when the}} declarer (or dummy) has high trump(s) but must not draw opponent's remaining trump(s). Instead, he ruffs a card high, and the opponent playing after, still having trump(s), must choose to under-ruff or give up one of menaces, either in form of a direct trick or an exit card, allowing later <b>endplay.</b> Since the squeeze may be without the count, the squeezed defender might take a later trick.|$|E
50|$|Fox Interactive Media also {{operated}} the websites of Fox's television stations. As {{part of a}} joint venture with LIN Media in 2008, Fox Interactive Media also began offering the Digital Publishing Platform (DPP), an enterprise content management system and hosting platform primarily intended for local station websites. The DPP products were later spun off as the independent company <b>EndPlay,</b> which Fox and LIN still hold equity interests in. Fox would begin outsourcing their television station websites to competing provider Worldnow in 2012.|$|E
50|$|According to {{the rules}} of the game, the right to select the first card to play (the opening lead) belongs to the defenders; afterwards, the right to lead belongs to the hand who has won the {{previous}} trick. Being on lead generally presents an advantage, as it presents an opportunity to choose a suit and card which will develop a trick for the leader's side. However, in <b>endplay</b> situations being on lead certainly does not present an advantageâ€”quite the opposite.|$|E
50|$|Other {{times it}} can gain one trick:South leads a spade to the 10. Assuming it loses, he reenters {{his hand and}} then leads another spade to the jack. North-South will take two spade tricks if West has either the king or the queen, or both (probability about 75% {{in the absence of}} any information), but only one if East has both (25%). However, this {{combination}} lends itself to an <b>endplay</b> - if one can be effected two tricks are guaranteed.|$|E
5000|$|Until 2001, WUPW was {{the only}} over-the-air {{television}} station {{in the area to}} air cartoons weekday afternoons as the local WB affiliate, WT05, was cable exclusive. In early-June 2007, WUPW, along with three other LIN TV-owned Fox affiliates switched their websites over to Fox Interactive Media's [...] "MyFox" [...] platform, becoming the first Fox stations not owned-and-operated by the network to adopt the site. WUPW later dropped MyFox in favor of a new site platform co-developed by LIN and Fox, spun off as the independent company <b>EndPlay.</b>|$|E
50|$|Even though KASA {{redesigned}} its logo {{shortly after}} LIN took over, its old WorldNow-powered website {{continued to use}} the Raycom era format until it was shut down on July 20, 2007 and replaced with a redirect to KASA's then-new website which, like the websites of the other LIN-owned Fox affiliates, used Fox Interactive's MyFox interface. However, in late 2008, the Web site address reverted to kasa.com (with myfoxnewmexico.com serving as a redirect), using a new interface jointly developed by LIN and Fox Interactive (now the <b>EndPlay</b> CMS platform).|$|E
50|$|An <b>endplay</b> (also throw-in), in {{bridge and}} similar games, is a {{tactical}} play where a defender {{is put on}} lead at a strategic moment, and then {{has to make a}} play that loses one or more tricks. Most commonly the losing play either constitutes a free finesse, or else it gives declarer a ruff and discard. In a case where declarer has no entries to dummy (or to his own hand), the defender may also be endplayed into leading a suit which can be won in that hand.|$|E
50|$|In November 2006, WPRI renewed its {{broadcasting}} license {{with the}} FCC. On May 18, 2007, LIN TV {{announced that it}} was exploring strategic alternatives that could have resulted in the sale of the company. In October 2008, WPRI and sister station WALA-TV in Mobile, Alabama relaunched websites through News Corporation's Fox Interactive Media (since spun off as the independent company known as <b>EndPlay,</b> which in turn was acquired by the Nexstar Broadcasting Group in 2014 and merged with its two other CMS providers, Inergize Digital and Internet Broadcasting to form a new CMS unit, Lakana) {{as a result of a}} new partnership between LIN TV and NewsCorp. The other LIN TV-owned stations (irrespective of network affiliations) followed suit within two months ending the company's long partnership with WorldNow. The new sites were in a format which is similar to those of the Fox O&O-style web addresses used by many Fox affiliates (and which the LIN TV-owned or controlled Fox affiliates such as WNAC-TV had used) except the flashy myFox look. The myFox sites themselves were eventually redesigned to a look similar to those of the LIN TV sites. After Nexstar's acquisition of <b>EndPlay</b> was completed, the LIN station Web sites switched to the WordPress.com VIP CMS platform, which most of the Web sites of the television stations Media General acquired since the announced merger with Young Broadcasting have since adopted.|$|E
5000|$|In September 2006, WFLD relaunched its website, {{migrating}} {{it to the}} [...] "MyFox" [...] {{platform that}} was also rolled out to the other Fox-owned stations. The MyFox sites would be refreshed in 2009 using a new platform developed by Fox and LIN Media (spun off as <b>EndPlay,</b> which Fox owned an equity interest in). In April 2012, WorldNow began to operate the websites for Fox's O&Os. On November 12, 2012, the station dropped the [...] "Fox Chicago" [...] branding after 15 years, and began branding as [...] "Fox 32" [...] full-time {{for the first time}} since 1993.|$|E
50|$|In 1973, Cotsakos {{started as}} a package handler at Federal Express in Los Angeles. In 1988 he became VP for European Operations, a title he held until 1992. For his next job, he stayed in Europe to work for ACNielsen, a market {{research}} firm. He was promoted in 1995 and served as global co-chief executive officer, president, {{and chief operating officer}} of the company. He left the Nielsen Company in 1996 to become CEO of E*TRADE, a financial services company. In April 2011, Cotsakos was announced as the Founding Chairman, CEO, and President of <b>EndPlay,</b> a Web Content Management System serving media, entertainment and education companies.|$|E
50|$|A ruff {{and discard}} (also known as ruff and slough or ruff and sluff) {{occurs when a}} player leads a suit that neither {{opponent}} has - typically in a suit contract, a defender leads a suit in which dummy and declarer are both void and dummy and declarer {{have at least one}} trump each. This gives declarer the option of discarding a losing card from one hand while playing a trump from the other, usually garnering an additional trick in the process. Thus, the ruff and discard is generally to be avoided by the defenders, except in rare cases where declarer has no side suit loser to discard. It is often inflicted upon the defence via an <b>endplay.</b>|$|E
50|$|In mid-June 2007, {{following}} the lead of most of the other LIN-owned Fox affiliates, WALA launched a new website using Fox Interactive's myFox interface. In October 2008, WALA and CBS sister station WPRI-TV in Providence, Rhode Island relaunched their websites through Fox Interactive {{as a result of a}} new partnership between LIN TV and News Corporation (since spun off as the independent company now known as <b>EndPlay).</b> The new sites were similar in format to the myFox sites (which WALA and the other LIN TV-owned Fox affiliates previously used) but without the flashy myFox owned-and-operated station-style look. Over the next few weeks, the other LIN-owned stations (irrespective of their network affiliation) followed suit.|$|E
50|$|On May 18, 2007, LIN TV {{announced}} that it was exploring strategic alternatives that could have resulted in the sale of the company. In early June, WDTN's website (along with those of several other LIN TV-owned stations not affiliated with Fox such as WNDY-TV, WWHO, WAND, WWLP, and WLFI-TV) underwent a redesign. The web addresses were then operated by the Local Media Network division of World Now for {{a little over a year}} until October 2008, when LIN TV relaunched most of its station websites through Fox Interactive Media (later spun off as the independent company known today as <b>EndPlay).</b> Prior to the World Now contract, the web addresses were powered by Web Pros.|$|E
5000|$|Almost {{immediately}} after {{taking control of}} WIWB, LIN TV would make changes at the station, starting with relocating its operations from the Parkview Plaza strip mall in suburban Ashwaubenon to WLUK's studios on Lombardi Avenue. During August and September 2010, the station would undergo changes in both on-air branding (from [...] "Wisconsin's CW" [...] to [...] "CW14") and call sign (from WIWB to WCWF). Also {{in the fall of}} 2010, WCWF would upgrade syndicated programming to high-definition (which already occurs on WLUK), while both WCWF and WLUK would begin hourly cross-promotions of each other's programming. In mid-November 2010, WCWF's website was switched from being managed by ACME's webhost, Desert Bloom Productions, to LIN Media Interactive (LIN Media's branding for <b>EndPlay,</b> formerly Fox Interactive Media).|$|E
50|$|Normally, declarer would cash the A and K separately. However, two spade {{entries to}} North might be needed, for reasons such as setting up North's side suit or {{preparing}} an <b>endplay.</b> If West holds the Q, declarer can reach dummy twice with an entry finesse: lead the 10 from hand and finesse the J. If the J holds, the K can later be overtaken by the A {{for the second}} entry to dummy. If West is aware of what's going on, though, he can stop it by covering the 10 with the Q. Now the suit is blocked, because the J cannot overtake the K. As with many deceptive plays, declarer should take the entry finesse as early in the play as possible, before the defense realizes it must play second hand high to block the suit.|$|E
