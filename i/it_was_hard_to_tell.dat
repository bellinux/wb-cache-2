500|$|Throughout this period, Harrison's {{devotion to}} Hindu spirituality – {{particularly}} to Krishna consciousness via {{his friendship with}} A.C. Bhaktivedanta Swami Prabhupada – reached new heights. As Harrison admitted, his adherence to his spiritual path was not necessarily consistent. His wife, Pattie Boyd, and their friend Chris O'Dell would joke that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> whether he was dipping into his ever-present Japa Yoga prayer bag or [...] "the coke bag". This duality has been noted by Harrison biographers Simon Leng and Alan Clayson: on one hand, Harrison earned himself the nickname [...] "His Lectureship" [...] during his prolonged periods of fervid devotion; on the other, he participated in bawdy London sessions {{for the likes of}} Bobby Keys' eponymous solo album and what Leng terms Harry Nilsson's [...] "thoroughly nasty" [...] "You're Breakin' My Heart", both recorded {{in the first half of}} 1972. Similarly, Harrison's passion for high-performance cars saw him lose his driver's licence for the second time in a year after crashing his Mercedes into a roundabout at 90 miles an hour, on 28 February, with Boyd in the passenger seat.|$|E
500|$|When {{musician}} Randy Castillo {{died from}} cancer in 2002, Slash, McKagan, and Sorum performed at a benefit concert {{to raise money}} and commemorate Castillo with Josh Todd and Keith Nelson of Buckcherry as well as B-Real and Sen Dog of Cypress Hill. Recognizing that their musical relationship was still intact, the trio began rehearsing with Todd and Nelson, working on material that would become [...] "Dirty Little Thing", but eventually decided against forming a group with them. During a Loaded show at West Hollywood's Viper Room, McKagan introduced Kushner to Slash, who were previously friends in {{junior high and high}} school. Kushner was invited to jam with the group and was soon invited to join with Slash, stating that [...] "Dave brought a cool vibe to what [...] were doing. There was no deliberation; that was it, it was a perfect fit." [...] Their former Guns N' Roses band mate Izzy Stradlin also joined them for two weeks, eventually suggesting that [...] "Duff and [...] will sing and [...] will just do a club tour in a van." [...] Slash states in his autobiography that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> if Stradlin was serious or kidding. After auditioning Kelly Shaefer of Atheist and Neurotica, Stradlin left the group.|$|E
500|$|Mark Washburn of Knight Ridder {{wrote that}} at the time of the episode's broadcast, most Americans were {{accustomed}} to seeing homosexual characters on television. He said this is why Patty's coming-out did not become as controversial as the episode's examination of the same-sex marriage issue, which was more sensitive in the country then. The controversy became so big that local news programs in certain cities aired segments about it. In response to the claims that this episode was supporting gay marriage, Al Jean replied that [...] "we don't really take any positions for or against anything, we just like to examine all sides of an issue and I think that anyone who would get their political wisdom from a cartoon might be sadly mistaken." [...] Likewise, Mark Pinsky writes in The Gospel According to The Simpsons that once the episode ended, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what stance on same-sex marriage the writers had and that [...] "both sides of the controversy had their say, voiced by various Simpsons characters". Jean has also cited the episode in defense to critics who say The Simpsons has lost its relevance and edginess in later years. In his book , John Ortved responded to this, commenting that despite the controversies the episode was [...] "in fact a long-winded and lame exploration of the topic." ...|$|E

500|$|Theme Hospital {{took over}} two years to develop. The idea came from Peter Molyneux and {{journalist}} James Leach, who explored the possibility of other Theme games while discussing Theme Park. Leach suggested a hospital, and Molyneux was enthusiastic about the idea. Development began when the designer Mark Webley selected Theme Hospital {{from a list of}} possible games put together by Molyneux, and Webley, along with the artist Gary Carr, visited the Royal Surrey County Hospital and Frimley Park Hospital to get inspiration. Carr was initially displeased at the prospect of working on Theme Hospital: he had previously left Bullfrog to work for The Bitmap Brothers because he did not have faith in Theme Park. He chose to return based on his belief that he would work on Dungeon Keeper, which he was eager to do. Initially, Theme Hospital was to feature real diseases, but these were replaced with fictional, comedic afflictions as it was decided that the game's maladies should not be too realistic: the team were faced with the dilemma of having to make the hospital fun and interesting, as Webley stated that theme parks are [...] "colourful" [...] compared to hospitals, and Carr believed that hospital rooms looked very similar and that <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> what each machines does. It was during a hospital visit that they {{came up with the idea}} of using made-up illnesses and cures: Carr considered death [...] "quite sad" [...] and believed that illness was not a popular subject. He stated that using made-up illnesses gave them [...] "creative freedom", which he believed was essential. Webley said that Carr was concerned that using real diseases might be considered distasteful. According to Carr, the team were aiming for humour rather than gore. During the initial stages of programming, Bullfrog hired James Leach, who wrote the game's text and came up with the diseases. Molyneux was not directly involved in the game's production as he was then working on Dungeon Keeper.|$|E
2500|$|Samuel Reid, a {{volunteer}} from Louisiana, described McCulloch and his ranger company as [...] "men in groups with long beards and mustaches, dressed in every variety of garment, with one exception, the slouched hat, the unmistakable uniform of a Texas ranger, and a brace of pistols around their waists, [...] were occupied drying their blankets, cleaning and fixing their guns, and some employed cooking at different fires, {{while others were}} grooming their horses. A rougher-looking set we never saw. They were without tents, and a miserable shed afforded them the only shelter. Captain McCulloch introduced us to his officers {{and many of his}} men, who appeared orderly and well-mannered people. But from their rough exterior, <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> who or what they were. Notwithstanding their ferocious and outlaw look, there were among them doctors and lawyers and many a college graduate." ...|$|E

McClure (later to become a professor of Divinity at Vanderbilt University), and Ron Easley, and with drummers Doug Garrison and, from 1993 on, Richard Dworkin (who also played for many years with the jazz group The Microscopic Septet), Chilton gained a reputation for his eclectic taste in song covers, guitar work, and laconic stage presence. Writing about a live performance in the New York Times, critic Peter Watrous said of Chilton that [...] "He's a soul and blues guitar connoisseur; he chooses his guitar licks as carefully as he does the blues songs he covers, and during his solos, a listener heard a history of soul and blues guitar." [...] Watrous {{went on to say}} of the show that [...] "Irony flowed over everything, and <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> exactly what Mr. Chilton was after, except perhaps a little fun." ...|$|E

2500|$|Initially, {{the judges}} {{who had served}} the Zhangs were retained, but in 1934, the Judicial Law College headed by the Japanese judge Furuta Masatake was opened in Changchun, to be {{replaced}} by a larger Law University in 1937. Right from the start, the new applicants vastly exceeded the number of openings as the first class of the Law College numbered only 100, but 1, 210 students had applied. The legal system that the students were trained was closely modeled after the Japanese legal system, which in its turn was modeled after the French legal system, but there were a number of particularities unique to Manchukuo. Law students were trained to write essays on such topics as the [...] "theory of the harmony of the five races [...] ", the [...] "political theory of the Kingly Way", [...] "practical differences between consular jurisdiction and extraterritoriality", and how best to [...] "realize the governance of the Kingly Way". The Japanese professors were [...] "astonished" [...] by the [...] "enthusiasm" [...] which the students wrote their essays on these subjects as the students expressed the hope that the wangdao was an uniquely Asian solution to the problems of the modern world, and that Manchukuo represented nothing less than the beginning of a new civilization that would led to an utopian society in the near-future. The Japanese professors were greatly impressed with the Confucian idealism of their students, but noted that their students all used stock phrases to the extent <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> their essays apart, cited examples of wise judges from ancient China while ignoring more recent legal developments, and were long on expressing idealistic statements about how the wangdao would led to a perfect society, but were short on how explaining just how this was to be done in practice.|$|E
2500|$|On October 31, 1983, about 2:00p.m., {{five members}} of a {{construction}} crew saw a 100-foot-long sea serpent off Stinson Beach, which is just north of San Francisco, California. A flagman named Gary saw it first swimming towards the cliffside road which the work crew was repairing. He radioed {{another member of the}} work crew, Matt Ratto, and told him to grab the binoculars. Ratto began looking at the sea serpent when it was 100 yards offshore and {{less than a quarter of}} a mile away. Ratto said, [...] "The body came out of the water first." [...] He added, [...] "It was black with three humps." [...] He continued, [...] "There were three bends. like humps and they rose straight up." [...] He further described it as a [...] "humpy, flat-backed thing". He also made a sketch of the animal which appeared to be a round headed, blunt nosed, snake-like creature followed by 3 vertical arches or coils sticking out of the water. Another eyewitness, Steve Bjora, said [...] "The sucker was going 45 to 50 miles an hour." [...] He also described the animal saying, [...] "It was clipping. It was boogying. It looked like a long eel." [...] Marlene Martin, the Caltran safety engineer who was over seeing the work crew also saw the animal. She said, [...] "It shocked the hell out of me" [...] adding, [...] "That thing's so big he deserves front page coverage." [...] She went on to say, [...] "It was hard to describe how big it was. I have no creative imagination. It was a snake-like thing that arched itself up and was so long it made humps above the water." [...] Martin first saw it near Bolinas and saw it swim the whole way to Stinson beach then watched it turn around and head towards the Farallon Islands. Martin said, [...] "It had a wake as big as a power boat's and it was going about 65 miles an hour. It looked like a great big rubber hose as it moved. If someone had gotten in its way it would have plowed right though them." [...] Before it went underwater Martin saw it lift its head and a portion of its body directly behind its head out of the water then open its mouth. Martin said, [...] "It was like it was playing." [...] She described the animal as a [...] "giant snake or a dragon, with a mouth like an alligator's." [...] She continued, [...] "It was at least 15 or 20 feet in circumference, but <b>it</b> <b>was</b> <b>hard</b> <b>to</b> <b>tell</b> how long it was. I mean, how long is a snake? Marlin Martin concluded by saying, [...] "He should have the whole damn ocean. It's his territory. He's the King of the Sea!" ...|$|E
