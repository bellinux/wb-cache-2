5|$|Different {{types of}} {{brachytherapy}} {{can be defined}} according to (1) {{the placement of the}} radiation sources in the target treatment area, (2) the rate or ‘intensity’ of the irradiation <b>dose</b> delivered to the tumour, and (3) the duration of <b>dose</b> delivery.|$|E
5|$|Gastrointestinal upset {{can cause}} severe discomfort; {{it is most}} common when {{metformin}} is first administered, or when the <b>dose</b> is increased. The discomfort can often be avoided by beginning at a low <b>dose</b> (1.0 to 1.7grams per day) and increasing the <b>dose</b> gradually but even with low doses 5% of people {{may be unable to}} tolerate metformin. Use of slow- or extended-release preparations may improve tolerability.|$|E
5|$|The median lethal <b>dose</b> (LD50) for acute {{radiation}} exposure is about 4.5Sv. The committed effective <b>dose</b> equivalent 210Po is 0.51µSv/Bq if ingested, and 2.5µSv/Bq if inhaled. So a fatal 4.5Sv <b>dose</b> {{can be caused}} by ingesting , about 50 nanograms (ng), or inhaling , about 10ng. One gram of 210Po could thus in theory poison 20 million people of whom 10 million would die. The actual toxicity of 210Po is lower than these estimates because {{radiation exposure}} that is spread out over several weeks (the biological half-life of polonium in humans is 30 to 50 days) is somewhat less damaging than an instantaneous <b>dose.</b> It has been estimated that a median lethal <b>dose</b> of 210Po is , or 0.089 micrograms, still an extremely small amount. For comparison, one grain of table salt is about 0.06mg = 60 μg.|$|E

5|$|The most {{dangerous}} {{side effect of}} doxorubicin is dilated cardiomyopathy, leading to congestive heart failure. The rate of cardiomyopathy is dependent on its cumulative <b>dose,</b> with an incidence about 4% when the <b>dose</b> of doxorubicin is 500–550mg/m², 18% when the <b>dose</b> is 551–600mg/m² and 36% when the <b>dose</b> exceeds 600mg/m². There are several ways in which doxorubicin is believed to cause cardiomyopathy, including oxidative stress, downregulation of genes for contractile proteins, and p53 mediated apoptosis. The drug dexrazoxane is used to mitigate doxorubicin's cardiotoxicity.|$|E
5|$|Without the {{protection}} of the Earth's atmosphere, cosmonauts were exposed to higher levels of radiation from a steady flux of cosmic rays and trapped protons from the South Atlantic Anomaly. The station's crews were exposed to an absorbed <b>dose</b> of about 5.2cGy {{over the course of a}} 115-day expedition, producing an equivalent <b>dose</b> of 14.75cSv, or 1133µSv per day. This daily <b>dose</b> is approximately that received from natural background radiation on Earth in two years. The radiation environment of the station was not uniform; closer proximity to the station's hull led to an increased radiation <b>dose,</b> and the strength of radiation shielding varied between modules; Kvant-2's being better than the core module, for instance.|$|E
5|$|For {{the first}} 10,000 years, the EPA would retain the 2001 final rule’s <b>dose</b> limit of 15millirem per year. This is {{protection}} {{at the level}} of the most stringent radiation regulations in the U.S. today. From 10,000 to one million years, EPA established a <b>dose</b> limit of 100millirem per year. EPA's rule requires the Department of Energy to show that Yucca Mountain can safely contain wastes, considering the effects of earthquakes, volcanic activity, climate change, and container corrosion, over one million years. The current analysis indicates that the repository will cause less than 1mrem/year public <b>dose</b> through 1,000,000 years.|$|E

The <b>dosing</b> unit has a pressure transmitter at the inlet, and the primary and secondary <b>dosing</b> sections are arranged one behind the other, to allow flow resistance to be detected due to pressure drop.

For comparison, bupropion and its three previously known primary metabolites, hydroxybupropion, threohydrobupropion, and erythrohydrobupropion represent 23% of a <b>dose</b> of bupropion excreted in urine.|$|E
30|$|The graph in Fig.  5 clearly {{represents}} {{that there}} is much difference between the efficiency of the sample coated by 1  % of <b>dosing</b> and 2  % of <b>dosing,</b> whereas there is less difference if the <b>dosing</b> of titanium nanoparticles was further increased. Furthermore, after the irradiation time of 150  min; both 2  % <b>dosing</b> and 3  % <b>dosing</b> have showed quite similar photocatalytic degradation rate.

5|$|At {{therapeutic}} <b>doses,</b> amphetamine causes {{emotional and}} cognitive effects such as euphoria, change in desire for sex, increased wakefulness, and improved cognitive control.

5|$|In United States practice, {{intravenous}} (IV) {{and oral}} administration {{are considered to}} be equally effective and safe if given within 8hours of ingestion. However, IV is the only recommended route in Australasian and British practice. Oral acetylcysteine is given as a 140mg/kg loading <b>dose</b> followed by 70mg/kg every four hours for 17 more doses, and if the patient vomits within 1 hour of <b>dose,</b> the <b>dose</b> must be repeated. Oral acetylcysteine may be poorly tolerated due to its unpleasant taste, odor, and its tendency to cause nausea and vomiting. If repeated doses of charcoal are indicated because of another ingested drug, then subsequent doses of charcoal and acetylcysteine should be staggered.|$|E
5|$|In general, insulin {{is given}} at 0.1unit/kg per hour {{to reduce the}} blood sugars and {{suppress}} ketone production. Guidelines differ as to which <b>dose</b> to use when blood sugar levels start falling; some recommend reducing the <b>dose</b> of insulin once glucose falls below 16.6mmol/l (300mg/dl) but other recommend infusing glucose in addition to saline to allow for ongoing infusion of higher doses of insulin.|$|E

40|$|Three {{different}} <b>dosing</b> modes, {{including one}} single <b>dosing</b> mode and two sequential <b>dosing</b> modes, were applied in high-arsenic contaminated water treatment. The results illustrated that the As (V) soluble and the As (V) nonspecifically sorbed were the insignificant species from Fe-As (V) samples in the sequential <b>dosing</b> mode, {{while they were}} higher in the single <b>dosing</b> mode. However, it could be further concluded that the mobility of the Fe-As (V) in sequential <b>dosing</b> mode was greater than that in single <b>dosing</b> mode. Besides, the main arsenic speciation governing the arsenic-borne coagulates was the As (V) associated with poorly crystalline hydrous oxides of Fe in sequential or single <b>dosing</b> mode. Moreover, the particle size distribution analysis indicated that the sequential <b>dosing</b> mode was more prevalent in neutralizing and adsorbing the As (V) compared with the single <b>dosing</b> mode. In the FT-IR spectra, the presence of arsenic was highlighted by a well resolved band at 825 – 829 cm− 1. The positions of the As–O stretching vibration bands were shifted gradually as the <b>dosing</b> mode changed from the single to the sequential. This result could be related to the distribution of arsenic speciation in different <b>dosing</b> modes...|$|R

Intermediate <b>dose</b> progestogen-only contraceptives—the progestogen-only pill Cerazette and the subdermal implant Nexplanon—allow some follicular development but more consistently inhibit ovulation in 97–99% of cycles.

High-dose, progestogen-only contraceptives—the injectables Depo-Provera and Noristerat—completely inhibit follicular development and ovulation.|$|E

5|$|The toxic <b>dose</b> of {{paracetamol}} {{is highly}} variable. In general the recommended maximum daily <b>dose</b> for healthy adults is 4grams. Higher doses lead to increasing risk of toxicity. In adults, single doses above 10grams or 200mg/kg of bodyweight, whichever is lower, {{have a reasonable}} likelihood of causing toxicity. Toxicity can also occur when multiple smaller doses within 24hours exceed these levels. Following a normal <b>dose</b> of 1gram of paracetamol {{four times a day}} for two weeks, patients can expect an increase in alanine transaminase in their liver to typically about three times the normal value. It is unlikely that this <b>dose</b> would lead to liver failure. Studies have shown significant hepatotoxicity is uncommon in patients who have taken greater than normal doses over 3 to 4 days. In adults, a <b>dose</b> of 6grams a day over the preceding 48hours could potentially lead to toxicity, while in children acute doses above 200mg/kg could potentially cause toxicity. Acute paracetamol overdose in children rarely causes illness or death, and it is very uncommon for children to have levels that require treatment, with chronic larger-than-normal doses being the major cause of toxicity in children.|$|E
