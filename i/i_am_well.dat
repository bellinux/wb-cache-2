2500|$|In the New Testament, John the Baptist preached a [...] "baptism with water", not of {{forgiveness}} but of penance or repentance for the remission of sins (...) , and declared himself a forerunner to {{one who would}} baptize 'with the Holy Spirit and with fire' (...) [...] In so doing he was preparing the way for Jesus. Jesus came to the Jordan River where he was baptized by John. The baptismal scene includes the Heavens opening, a dove-like descent of the Holy Spirit, and a voice from Heaven saying, [...] "This is my beloved Son with whom <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>well</b> pleased." ...|$|E
2500|$|Such was {{the extent}} to which {{stronger}} drugs entered cycling that the French team manager, Marcel Bidot, was cited to an inquiry by the Council of Europe as saying: [...] "Three-quarters of riders were doped. <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>well</b> placed to know that since I visited their rooms each evening during the Tour. I always left frightened after these visits." [...] At the 1956 Tour, it was evident how much drug-taking and the [...] "care" [...] of riders had changed. After stage 14, all members of the Belgian team chose to abandon the race following a [...] "mystery illness". Insiders suspected doping usage as the real reason, while the team attributed the illness to a dinner of 'bad fish' they had eaten, an excuse which was reused in both 1962 and 1991.|$|E

2500|$|Following the {{proclamation}} by Peter, {{the account of}} the Transfiguration of Jesus is the next major event and appears in , [...] and [...] Jesus takes Peter and two other apostles with him and goes up to a mountain, which is not named. Once on the mountain, Matthew (17:2) states that Jesus [...] "was transfigured before them; his face shining as the sun, and his garments became white as the light." [...] At that point, the prophets Elijah and Moses appear and Jesus begins to talk to them. Luke is specific in describing Jesus in a state of glory, with Luke 9:32 referring to [...] "they saw his glory". A bright cloud appears around them, and a voice from the cloud states: [...] "This is my beloved Son, with whom <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>well</b> pleased; listen to him".|$|E
2500|$|In {{depictions of}} the Life of Christ, the hand often appears at the Baptism of Christ {{representing}} the voice of God, above the dove representing the Holy Spirit, {{which is much more}} common, thus showing the whole Trinity as present and active. The hand never seems to appear without the dove, as the Holy Spirit as a dove is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark: [...] "As soon as Jesus was baptized, he went up out of the water. At that moment heaven was opened, and he saw the Spirit of God descending like a dove and lighting on him. And a voice from heaven said, [...] "This is my Son, whom I love; with him <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>well</b> pleased." [...] Both dove and hand are normally located centrally, pointing straight down at Jesus. The hand is mostly found in Baptisms between the 6th (e.g. Rabbula Gospels) and 11th centuries.|$|E
2500|$|Glinda's Great Book of Records is {{introduced}} in Chapter 29 of The Emerald City of Oz: [...] " [...] 'It {{is a record}} of everything that happens,' replied the Sorceress. 'As soon as an event takes place, anywhere in the world, it is immediately found printed in my Magic Book. So when I read its pages <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>well</b> informed.' [...] " [...] The Book proves useful in The Scarecrow of Oz and Glinda of Oz; and it recurs {{in many of the}} stories of Baum's successors and imitators. It is one of the prime magic devices of Oz; villains steal it when they can (as in The Lost Princess of Oz or in Handy Mandy in Oz). Since it covers the planet and not merely Oz, the Book's entries are compressed and sometimes cryptic, and difficult to decipher (as in Paradox in Oz or Queen Ann in Oz).|$|E

2500|$|On 11 September, the {{day after}} Piquet Jr.'s {{statement}} to the FIA was leaked, Renault F1 stated that it intended to take legal action against Nelson Piquet Jr and his father in both French and British courts, stating that [...] "...today the ING Renault F1 Team and its managing director Flavio Briatore personally wish to state they have commenced criminal proceedings against Nelson Piquet Jr and Nelson Piquet Sr in France concerning the making of false allegations and a related attempt to blackmail the team into allowing Mr Piquet Jr to drive {{for the remainder of}} the 2009 season". In response to the legal action, Piquet Jr. stated [...] "Because I am telling the truth I have nothing to fear, whether from the Renault team or Mr Briatore – and while <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>well</b> aware of the power and influence of those being investigated, and the vast resources at their disposal, I will not be bullied again into making a decision I regret".|$|E
2500|$|Matthew {{begins with}} the [...] "generation" [...] of Jesus as Son of David, {{followed}} by the visit of the gentile Magi, and the flight into Egypt to escape Herod, after whose death the holy family returns into the land of Israel, then moves to Nazareth, and then includes a detailed version of the preaching of John the Baptist, followed by the baptism of Jesus. [...] John protests to Jesus {{that he needs to}} be baptized by Jesus, but Jesus tells him to let it be so now, saying that it is fitting {{for the two of them}} ("for us") to thus [...] "fulfill all righteousness." [...] When Jesus is baptized, he goes up immediately out of the water, the heavens open and John sees the Spirit of God descend upon him like a dove, alighting on him, and he hears a voice from heaven say, [...] "This is my beloved Son, with whom <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>well</b> pleased." ...|$|E
2500|$|Even what Luke {{does say}} about Christ is {{ambiguous}} or even contradictory. For example, according to Luke 2:11 Jesus was the Christ at his birth, but in Acts 10:37–38 he becomes Christ at the resurrection, while in Acts 3:20 it seems his messiahship is active {{only at the}} parousia, the [...] "second coming"; similarly, in Luke 2:11 he is the Saviour from birth, but in Acts 5:31 he is made Saviour at the resurrection; and he is born the Son of God in Luke 1:32–35, but becomes the Son of God at the resurrection according to Acts 13:33. Many of these differences {{may be due to}} scribal error, but others were deliberate alterations to doctrinally unacceptable passages, or the introduction by scribes of [...] "proofs" [...] for their favourite theological tenets. An important example of such deliberate alterations is found in Luke's account of the baptism of Jesus, where virtually all the earliest witnesses have God saying, [...] "This day I have begotten you." [...] (Luke has taken the words of God from Psalm 2, an ancient royal adoption formula in which the king of Israel was recognised as God's elect). This reading is theologically difficult, as it implies that God is now conferring status on Jesus that he did not previously hold. It is unlikely, therefore, that the more common reading of Luke 3:22 (God says to Jesus, [...] "You are my beloved son, with you <b>I</b> <b>am</b> <b>well</b> pleased") is original.|$|E
