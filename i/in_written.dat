5|$|Cohesion between {{sentences}} is achieved {{through the use}} of deictic pronouns as anaphora (e.g. that is exactly what I mean where that refers to some fact known to both interlocutors, or then used to locate the time of a narrated event relative to the time of a previously narrated event). Discourse markers such as oh, so or well, also signal the progression of ideas between sentences and help to create cohesion. Discourse markers are often the first constituents in sentences. Discourse markers are also used for stance taking in which speakers position themselves in a specific attitude towards what is being said, for example, no way is that true! (the idiomatic marker no way! expressing disbelief), or boy! I'm hungry (the marker boy expressing emphasis). While discourse markers are particularly characteristic of informal and spoken registers of English, they are also used <b>in</b> <b>written</b> and formal registers.|$|E
5|$|Ermanaric's great-nephew, Vinitharius, who disliked {{being under}} Hun rule, withdrew his forces and marched against the Antes {{in order to}} defeat them and to show his courage.

Boz, the king of the Antes (rex Antorum), had organized an alliance to defend the Antes, and managed to defeat Vinitharius in their first encounters, however, Vinitharius fought valiantly and managed to capture and crucify Boz, together with his sons and 70 of his chiefs (primates). Vinitharius left their bodies hanging to induce fear in those who had surrendered.

5|$|One of {{the most}} {{original}} monuments in Jordan, and perhaps in the Hellenistic period in the Near East, is the village of Iraq Al-Amir in the valley of Wadi Al-Sir, southwest of Amman, which is home to Qasr Al-Abd (Castle of the Slave).

Qasr Al-Abd {{is believed to have been}} built by Hyrcanus of Jerusalem, who was the head of the powerful Tobiad family. Shortly after he began the construction of that large building, in 170 BC upon returning from a military campaign in Egypt, Antiochus IV conquered Jerusalem, ransacked a temple where the treasure of Hyrcanus was kept and appeared determined to attack Hyrcanus. Upon hearing this, Hyrcanus committed suicide, leaving his palace in Philadelphia uncompleted. The Tobiads fought the Arab Nabateans for twenty years until they lost the city to them.

5|$|Richard B. Parkinson and Ludwig D.

Parkinson and Morenz also speculate that written works of the Middle Kingdom were transcriptions of the oral literature of the Old Kingdom. It is known that some oral poetry was preserved in later writing; for example, litter-bearers' songs were preserved as written verses in tomb inscriptions of the Old Kingdom.|$|E

The {{correlation}} between grammatical competency and attitude toward Indonesian language {{with the ability}} <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation (a survey on university students of Physic Education at Ahmad Dahlan University). Advisor Dr. Budhi Setiawan, M. Pd. and Co-advisor Dr. Andayani, M. Pd. Thesis. Surakarta: Indonesian Language Education Study Program, Sebelas Maret University. This research is aimed to determine the {{correlation between}} (1) grammatical competency and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation, (2) attitude toward Indonesian language and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation, (3) grammatical competency and attitude toward Indonesian language and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation. The research was conducted at Physic Education, Ahmad Dahlan University, from July to October 2010. The research used descriptive of correlation. The research population was the second semester at Physic Education. The sample consisted of 40 university students who were taken by using purposive random sampling. The instruments for collecting the data in this research are test of writing argumentation, multiple choice test in grammatical competency, and questioner test in attitude toward Indonesian language. The instruments validity test used product moment and r point biserial. The instruments reliability test used KR- 20 and alpha cronbach. The technique analysis for analyzing the data was the statistical technique of regression and correlation. The result of the study showes that: (1) {{there is a positive}} correlation between grammatical competency and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation (1 y r = 0, 84 at the level of significance α = 0, 05 with N= 40 where tt = 1, 68); (2) there is a positive correlation between attitude toward Indonesian language and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation (2 y r = 0, 42 at the level of significance α = 0, 05 with N= 40 where tt = 1, 68); (3) there is a positive correlation between grammatical competency and attitude toward Indonesian language and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation (Ry. 1. 2 = 0, 87 at the level of significance α = 0, 05 with N= 40 where ft = 3, 25). The result above shows that grammatical competency and attitude toward Indonesian language give significant contribution to the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation. It shows that both of variables can become good predictors for the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation. The analysis also indicates that the correlation between grammatical competency and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation is stronger than attitude toward Indonesian language and the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation. It shows that grammatical competency can be a better predictor for the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation. This reality brings consequence in learning the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation, so teacher has to make priority in order to increase grammatical competency in learning the ability <b>in</b> <b>writing</b> argumentation than attitude toward Indonesian language.

5|$|The Manipuri pony is a {{breed of}} pony {{developed}} in India. Experts disagree on its exact origin, {{although they do}} {{agree that it is}} an ancient breed, possibly developed from either the Tibetan pony or a cross between the Mongolian Wild Horse and the Arabian. First mentioned <b>in</b> <b>written</b> chronicles in 1584, Manipuri ponies were used as cavalry horses throughout the 17th and 18th centuries. In the late 19th and early 20th centuries, they were in demand by the British for use as polo ponies. Breed numbers have dwindled, however, mainly due to exports, and today the population is very low. In 2007, a genetic study was conducted on the Manipuri and four other Indian equine breeds. The Manipuri was shown to be genetically close to three other Indian pony breeds, but genetically more distant from the Marwari, the sole Indian horse breed in the study. The Manipuri pony was originally bred for polo and military usage, and today is bred mainly for playing polo and racing, although it is also in demand for military transport use.|$|E
5|$|The Song {{judicial}} system retained {{most of the}} legal code of the earlier Tang dynasty, the basis of traditional Chinese law up until the modern era. Roving sheriffs maintained {{law and order in}} the municipal jurisdictions and occasionally ventured into the countryside. Official magistrates overseeing court cases were not only expected to be well-versed <b>in</b> <b>written</b> law but also to promote morality in society. Magistrates such as the famed Bao Qingtian (999–1062) embodied the upright, moral judge who upheld justice and never {{failed to live up to}} his principles. Song judges specified the guilty person or party in a criminal act and meted out punishments accordingly, often in the form of caning. A guilty individual or parties brought to court for a criminal or civil offense were not viewed as wholly innocent until proven otherwise, while even accusers were viewed with a high level of suspicion by the judge. Due to costly court expenses and immediate jailing of those accused of criminal offences, people in the Song preferred to settle disputes and quarrels privately, without the court's interference.|$|E
