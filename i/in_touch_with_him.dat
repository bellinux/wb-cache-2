25|$|Sony {{was born}} Warrick Swinney in Port Elizabeth on 12 September 1958. He {{grew up in}} the Cowies Hill area of Durban, {{attending}} Westville High School where he played in school-based groups doing covers of songs by Jimi Hendrix and The Who. He was influenced by Indian music and cuisine and by the work of Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart. He learned to play tabla at the Hindu Sarat school in Durban. In 1976 he was conscripted into the South African Defence Force, where he declared himself a Hindu pacifist, and was assigned to medical duties and then to band work. During his military service, Sony played B♭ horn, euphonium and drums. He changed his surname from Swinney to Sony to make it harder for the army to get <b>in</b> <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him</b> for camps; he chose Sony because he liked their products. Whilst in the army in 1977, his father brought him a whole lot of punk rock albums from an overseas trip. This was his first exposure to Sex Pistols and the Clash. By the time his two years service was over he had schooled himself {{in a lot of the}} post punk Art rock bands as well as reggae and dub and had developed a healthy respect for Shangaan bass players.|$|E

[...] Will's description of his relationship with Edward closely resembled August's own relationship with his father.

The celebrated phrase, [...] "I will fight in front of Paris, I will fight in Paris, I will fight behind Paris", attributed both to Foch and Clemenceau, illustrated the Généralissime's resolve to keep the Allied armies intact, even at the risk of losing the capital. The British General Sir Henry Rawlinson, commanding the British Fourth Army, commented after meeting Foch: [...] "I am overjoyed at his methods and far-sighted strategy.

The Turks have more of these, the VII Army have 2400, and the VIII Army 5800 in Reserve. I must maintain my hold on the bridges of the Jordan, and my control of the Dead Sea.

It quickly became apparent that McGrath had a number of songs of his own and so they agreed to two singers and two songwriters. The band began to rehearse and recorded their debut, self-titled EP after playing a couple of local shows. They launched their EP at seminal Brisbane venue The Zoo in mid-2008 and quickly set out to play as many shows as possible.|$|R
5|$|Although Bucer {{assisted}} {{in the development of}} the English Reformation, he was still quite concerned about the speed of its progress. Both Bucer and Fagius had noticed that the 1549 Prayer Book was not a remarkable step forward, although Cranmer assured Bucer that it was only a first step and that its initial form was only temporary. However, by the winter 1550, Bucer was becoming disillusioned. Cranmer, however, made sure that he did not feel alienated and kept <b>in</b> close <b>touch</b> <b>with</b> <b>him.</b> This attention paid off during the vestments controversy. This incident was initiated by John Hooper, a follower of Heinrich Bullinger who had recently returned from Zürich. Hooper was unhappy with Cranmer's Prayer Book and Ordinal and he particularly objected to the use of ceremonies and vestments. When the Privy Council selected him to be the Bishop of Gloucester on 15 May 1550, he laid down conditions that he would not wear the required vestments. He found an ally among the Continental reformers in Jan Łaski who had become a leader of the Stranger church in London, a designated place of worship for Continental Protestant refugees. His church's forms and practices had taken reforms much further than Cranmer would have liked. However, Bucer and Peter Martyr, while they sympathised with Hooper's position, supported Cranmer's arguments of timing and authority. Cranmer and Ridley stood their ground. This led to Hooper's imprisonment and he eventually gave in. He was consecrated on 8 March 1551 according to the Ordinal and he preached before the king in his episcopal garments. Cranmer's vision of reform through careful steps under the authority of the government was maintained.|$|R
