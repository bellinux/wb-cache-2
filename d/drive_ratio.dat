25|$|All four-speed manual {{transmissions}} {{were built}} at the Muncie, Indiana Allison plant. The 1984 production line saw two transmissions, a performance four-speed with a final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 4.10, and an economy four-speed with a final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.32. The V6 on the 1985 model {{and part of the}} 1986 production year came with a four-speed with a final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 3.65. The lower-geared 4.10 four-speed transmission showed improved acceleration, but sacrificed fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|In North America, the Spark {{was first}} {{delivered}} to GM dealerships in Mexico for the 2012 model year, {{but did not}} replace the Chevrolet Matiz (formerly Pontiac G2 Matiz) which is still sold (as of 2014). The United States version of the 2013 Chevrolet Spark went into production on April 16, 2012, and arrived in dealerships in August 2012. For 2014 in North America, the automatic transmission is a Jatco M4M-CVT7 Continuously Variable Transmission (CVT) and the final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> lowered to 3.75. The CVT gives better fuel mileage overall than the previous 4 speed automatic, and changing the final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> from its previous 4.145 reduces engine noise and increases fuel economy on the highway while increasing noise and reducing fuel mileage in the city. Industry sources have commented on the ongoing reliability issues with the Jatco CVT transmissions.|$|E
25|$|Even {{though the}} final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> for {{vehicles}} equipped with the 7-speed automatic has been (numerically) reduced from 3.69 to 3.36, the new 7-speed automatic has much lower first through fourth gear overall ratios than the old 5-speed automatic and the 6-speed manual in the 6MT cars (which retain the old 3.69 final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio).</b> Giving it closer gear ratios in all gears, to match engine rpm better with power demand, brings better acceleration while overdrive ratios in 6th and 7th gears reduces highway cruising rpm and improves fuel mileage. The new 7-speed automatic retains the Drive Sport (DS) shift mode and Downshift Rev Matching (DRM) feature of the previous 5-speed automatic. Paddle shifters are standard on G37S models equipped with the 7-speed automatic. The new engine/transmission combo did add some weight the car (3,590lb. for the G37 vs. 3,508 for the G35 in identical trim).|$|E
50|$|While {{similar in}} concept to a {{continuously}} variable transmission, the friction drive transmission has five fixed indents corresponding to pre-set <b>drive</b> <b>ratios.</b>|$|R

5000|$|The [...] "MN8" [...] 4L85-E is able {{to handle}} {{vehicles}} with up to 460 ft·lbf (624 N·m) of torque. Final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 3.42, 3.73, and 4.10.|$|R
25|$|Rambler's {{emphasis}} on economy over performance {{can be observed}} through the example of automatic transmission use in a Rambler American where the 1959 owner's handbook describes leaving the gear selector in the D-2 position (1.47:1 gear ratio) blocks access to low gear (2.40 ratio) when starting out from a stop; therefore, given the car's 3.31 axle, this yields an initial 4.86:1 final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> reducing crankshaft revolutions for maximum fuel economy.|$|E
25|$|Power is {{transferred}} from the engine to the rear wheels through a six-speed sequential transaxle with an integrated spool differential. The individual gear ratios and the final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> are fixed with drop gears {{at the front of}} the transaxle allowing the teams to alter the overall transmission ratio for different circuits. The cars use a triple plate clutch. The cars run on E85 fuel with a fuel tank capacity of 112 litres.|$|E
25|$|The {{suspension}} was upgraded with a 43mm Kayaba inverted fork with sliders {{having a}} diamond-like carbon (DLC) coating. The rear shock {{is also a}} Kayaba, and the overall suspension is firmer than the previous model. The swingarm is similar in design to the old one, but was strengthened. Front and rear remain fully adjustable. The transmission was given a heavier-duty, slipper clutch. The final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> was slightly lower, and gears 5-6 were spaced farther apart, and gear ratios 1-2 moved closer together.|$|E
5000|$|The [...] "MT1" [...] 4L80-E is able {{to handle}} engines with up to 440 ft·lbf (597 N·m) of torque. Final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 3.42, 3.73, and 4.10.|$|R
50|$|At present, final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> {{higher than}} 3.20 (3.2 engine {{rotations}} to one rear axle rotation) are prohibited, {{in an effort}} to limit top speed potential, thus reducing the perceived level of danger.|$|R
50|$|The 5L50 is {{engineered}} {{to handle the}} stresses from vehicles weighing up to 5000 lb (2268 kg) GVWR. Final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> include 2.93:1 and 3.23:1. The 5L50 can handle up to 311 ft·lbf (422 N·m) of torque.|$|R
25|$|For 2007, Ford's Special Vehicle Team {{launched}} Shelby GT500, {{a successor}} to the 2003/2004 Mustang SVT Cobra. The GT500 shared basic design characteristics {{with that of the}} Mustang V6 and GT. It retained the same basic live axle rear suspension setup of the Mustang V6 and GT, with some minor durability enhancements such as thicker sheetmetal supports and extra welds, as well as redesigned strut towers to accommodate a wider engine. The supercharged 5.4L 32-valve DOHC V8 engine with an iron block and aluminum heads was rated at 500hp (373kW) @ 6000rpm and 480lb·ft (650N·m) of torque @ 4500rpm. The Tremec TR6060 6-speed manual transmission used a 3.31:1 rear <b>drive</b> <b>ratio.</b> Wheels are 18×9.5inch with P255/45ZR18 tires in the front and P285/40ZR18 tires in the rear. Brembo 14-inch disc brakes with aluminum four-piston calipers are on the front with 11.8-inch disc brakes with single-piston calipers in the rear.|$|E
500|$|In 1960, McCormack {{noticed that}} one Honda dealer in Boise, Idaho was selling more Honda 50s than the {{combined}} total of all six dealers in Los Angeles. He {{found out that}} the Idaho dealer, Herb Uhl, was selling the CA100s as a trail bike by adding knobby tires for off-road traction and a [...] "cheater sprocket," [...] that is, increasing the final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> by using a larger rear sprocket with more teeth, which increased the effective torque of the rear wheel, trading off lower top speed as a result. Uhl said the advantages of light weight and the automatic clutch allowed unskilled riders to enjoy off-road riding, in comparison to traditional big trail bikes that could be difficult to handle. McCormack shipped a version of Uhl's customized CA100 to Japan and requested Honda put it into production, and by March 1961 the Trail 50 was available to US dealers. Cycle World praised the simple pleasure of trail riding on the new bike, and it was a US sales success.|$|E

40|$|The {{numerical}} computation {{of the flow}} and heat transfer {{in the vicinity of}} a stack plate in a standing wave refrigerator is performed. Temperature distortion is observed, which appears only in the stack region, even if the acoustic standing wave outside the stack is itself sinusoidal. The distortion takes place above the whole plate surface when the length of the plate is equal to or shorter than four times the particle displacement. This condition may occur at high <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> and is favored by plate positions close to the velocity antinode. The thermal distortion decreases the thermoacoustic heat pumping along the plate. At high <b>drive</b> <b>ratios,</b> if the length of the plate is not large enough, the thermal distortion can typically explain a difference of about 10 % between the calculated heat flux and the heat flux predicted using linear theory...|$|R

The V6 was now the only engine, rated initially at [...] SAE and [...] of torque. It used the Turbo-Hydramatic 440-T4 automatic with a 2.84:1 final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio.</b> [...] This generation was noted for advanced electronic instrumentation displayed on a dash-mounted [...] CRT. The CRT controlled the vehicle's climate control system and stereo, and also supplied advanced instrumentation such as a trip computer and maintenance reminder feature. Four-wheel disc brakes were standard. With a choice of three suspension packages available, up to the performance oriented FE3 setting, handling was notably improved. The Riviera placed fourth for Motor Trends 1986 Car of the Year contest.|$|E

As used in the 3.2 and the 505, the engine had a compression ratio of 7.2:1, up from the 7.0:1 of the original 2.6 L V8 engine. In this tune, the engine yielded [...] The final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> was raised from 4.225:1 on the smaller-engined sedans to 3.89:1 on the 3.2 to reduce the fuel consumption of the larger engine.|$|E
2500|$|The design {{specifically}} includes {{features for}} safety, reliability and appearance. In place of cardan shaft drives to the wheels, coupling rods {{were used to}} give people something to watch and engine covers were omitted to give {{a good view of}} the Rolls-Royce diesel engines. The full-length canopy above the engine covers not only adds to the distinctive outline but also supports the exhaust silencer. For added safety with only one man in the cab, a dead-man device is included, a pedal that when released triggers the braking system to bring the train safely to a halt. The turbocharged six-cylinder engine is rated at [...] and drives through a hydraulic transmission that has only one <b>drive</b> <b>ratio.</b> The result is a locomotive that accelerates quickly up to speed. All four locomotives were rebuilt in 2012–13 in readiness for the launch of the new [...] "traditional diesel" [...] service.|$|E
50|$|The engine’s {{power is}} {{transferred}} via a sequential six-speed sport gearbox, which is operated pneumatically using shift paddles {{mounted on the}} steering wheel. The gearbox {{is one of the}} standard components, which are used by all the DTM manufacturers. It has 11 final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios,</b> which allow the engineers and drivers to react to the respective circuit and engine characteristics when setting the car up.|$|R
50|$|The 4T60-E {{featured}} a 245mm torque converter with varying stall speed and gear ratios. For example, a '95 Beretta features a 1650 rpm stall converter {{as opposed to}} '99 Century converter with a stall of 2095 rpm. In the 4T60 family of transmissions, the combination of drive-chain sprocket ratios and the differential gear ratio together offer up to 12 different possible final <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> to allow the transmission family to cover various engine and vehicle applications.|$|R

The GT model was capable of performing a quarter-mile test in 13.8 seconds @ 99 MPH, with acceleration from zero to 60 MPH in 5.6 seconds. The Mustang GT also came equipped with a limited slip differential complete with the same carbon-fiber clutch discs used in the 2003 to 2004 SVT Cobra and the 2007 Shelby GT500. The differential uses the 31-spline axles and the [...] ring gear. The standard final <b>drive</b> <b>ratio</b> of 2005 and 2006 Mustang GTs with a manual transmission was 3.55:1.

40|$|Approved {{for public}} release; {{distribution}} is unlimitedThe {{purpose of this}} thesis is to provide data {{on the evolution of}} the temperature profile in a simple thermoacoustic stack. These measurements are made to support the development of nonlinear time-dependent models of thermoacoustics. An acoustic resonator and driver is used with a five plate stainless steel stack. The center plate of the stack is instrumented with nine thermocouples, one in the midpoint and four near each end of the plate. The edge thermocouples are located within an acoustic displacement amplitude of one another at high amplitude drive conditions. Temperature evolution data is recorded for both argon and helium gases at several mean pressures and several <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> with the stack located between a pressure node and antinode. This data showed a deviation from linear theory at <b>drive</b> <b>ratios</b> above 1. 5 %. A crossover of gradient magnitudes is evident during gradient formation with edge thermocouple pairs initially forming larger gradients but dropping in magnitude to less than those of the inner thermocouple pairs after 25 - 50 seconds. As the gradients approached steady state conditions, they split into two groups of gradient pairs that appeared independent of displacement amplitude. Measurements are also made with the stack positioned in the vicinity of a pressure node and a pressure antinode. This data will be used for future study.
