5000|$|An equity {{security}} is a share <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>interest</b> in an entity such as the capital stock of a company, trust or partnership. The most common form <b>of</b> <b>equity</b> <b>interest</b> is common stock, although preferred equity is also a form of capital stock. The holder <b>of</b> an <b>equity</b> is a shareholder, owning a share, or fractional part of the issuer. Unlike debt securities, which typically require regular payments (interest) to the holder, equity securities are not entitled to any payment. In bankruptcy, they share only in the residual interest of the issuer after all obligations have been paid out to creditors. However, equity generally entitles the holder to a pro rata portion of control of the company, meaning that a holder of a majority <b>of</b> the <b>equity</b> is usually entitled to control the issuer. Equity also enjoys the right to profits and capital gain, whereas holders of debt securities receive only interest and repayment of principal regardless of how well the issuer performs financially. Furthermore, debt securities do not have voting rights outside of bankruptcy. In other words, equity holders are entitled to the [...] "upside" [...] of the business and to control the business.|$|R
