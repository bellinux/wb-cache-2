5|$|Municipalities <b>in</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island can {{incorporate}} as a town or city {{by a special}} act of the state legislature {{and there is no}} minimum population requirement. Eight municipalities were reincorporated as cities operating under a charter, while the other thirtyone remain as towns which perform similar services. Since Rhode Island has no county level of government, cities and towns provide services commonly performed by county governments in other states. Rhode Island's cities and towns may adopt one of four different forms of government: councilmanager, mayorcouncil, town counciltown meeting, or administratorcouncil. The primary difference between these forms of government is how the chief executive is selected. The Councilmanager system involves an elected council who exercise overall control of the local government and a chief executive termed city or town manager who is generally appointed by and responsible to the council for the administration of local policies. Councilmanager systems may elect a mayor but they have no formal administrative functions with the potential exception of a degree of veto power. Mayorcouncil systems have a similarly elected council however the mayor is elected and yields administrative power. In the town counciltown meeting system, there is no fulltime chief executive. There are no towns or cities <b>in</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island that use the administratorcouncil form of government.|$|E
5|$|This {{is a list}} of {{the five}} {{counties}} in the U.S. state of Rhode Island.

Counties <b>in</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island have had no governmental functions since 1846 other than as court administrative and sheriff corrections boundaries which are part of state government.|$|E

5|$|A {{weather station}} in Norfolk, Virginia {{recorded}} gusts of 3844mph (6171km/h) and 0.17inches (4.31mm) of rainfall.

A wide variety of factors contributed to the high death toll, including over-exertion, exposure to cold, transportation accidents, structural fires, and carbon monoxide poisoning. The storm caused some isolated power failures along its path. In north-central Virginia, telephone and electricity lines were damaged. The blizzard cut electricity to all of Newtown, Connecticut, though it was mostly restored within hours. <b>In</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island, Block Island and some inland towns were without power.

Six days later she lost all of her masts during a gale. Because her rigging had been set and tightened in a cold climate, it had slackened once she reached warmer temperatures. Without the full support of the rigging, all the masts fell during a four-hour period, killing one crew member trying to repair the main mast.|$|E
5|$|In 1780, {{approximately}} 5,500 French soldiers landed <b>in</b> <b>Rhode</b> Island {{to assist}} their American allies in operations against British-controlled New York City.

On the advice of Rochambeau, de Grasse informed them of his intent to sail to the Chesapeake Bay, where Cornwallis had taken command of the army. Cornwallis, at first given confusing orders by his superior officer, Henry Clinton, was eventually ordered to build a defensible deep-water port, which he began to do in Yorktown, Virginia.
