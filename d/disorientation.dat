40|$|The grain {{structure}} of an Al– 0. 3  wt%Mn alloy deformed to 1 % strain was reconstructed using diffraction contrast tomography (DCT) and high-energy diffraction microscopy (HEDM). 14 equally spaced HEDM layers were acquired and their exact location within the DCT volume was determined using a generic algorithm minimizing {{a function of}} the local <b>disorientations</b> between the two data sets. The microstructures were then compared in terms of the mean crystal orientations and shapes of the grains. The comparison shows that DCT can detect subgrain boundaries with <b>disorientations</b> as low as 1 ° and that HEDM and DCT grain boundaries are on average 4  µm apart from each other. The results are important for studies targeting the determination of grain volume. For the case of a polycrystal with an average grain size of about 100  µm, a relative deviation of about ≤ 10 % was found between the two techniques...|$|R

5|$|The {{symptoms}} of narcosis {{may be caused}} by other factors during a dive: ear problems causing <b>disorientation</b> or nausea; early signs of oxygen toxicity causing visual disturbances; or hypothermia causing rapid breathing and shivering. Nevertheless, the presence of any of these symptoms should imply narcosis. Alleviation of the effects upon ascending to a shallower depth will confirm the diagnosis. Given the setting, other likely conditions do not produce reversible effects. In the rare event of misdiagnosis when another condition is causing the symptoms, the initial management– ascending closer to the surface– is still essential.|$|E

5|$|Alzheimer's disease (AD), also {{referred}} to simply as Alzheimer's, is a chronic neurodegenerative disease that usually starts slowly and worsens over time. It {{is the cause of}} 60% to 70% of cases of dementia. The most common early symptom is difficulty in remembering recent events (short-term memory loss). As the disease advances, symptoms can include problems with language, <b>disorientation</b> (including easily getting lost), mood swings, loss of motivation, not managing self care, and behavioural issues. As a person's condition declines, they often withdraw from family and society. Gradually, bodily functions are lost, ultimately leading to death. Although the speed of progression can vary, the average life expectancy following diagnosis is three to nine years.|$|E
5|$|Chronic wasting disease, {{transmitted}} by a misfolded protein {{known as a}} prion, affects the brain tissue in elk, and has been detected throughout their range in North America.

Elk that have contracted the disease begin to show weight loss, increased watering needs, <b>disorientation</b> and listlessness, and at an advanced stage the disease leads to death. The disease is similar to but not the same as mad cow disease, and no risks to humans have been documented, nor has the disease been demonstrated to pose a threat to domesticated cattle.

5|$|Dynamic editing {{contributed to}} the surrealistic nature of the episode. Abrupt cuts from {{close-up}} to extreme wide angles and sudden shifts from normal speed to super slow-motion are used in Buffy's dream: several sequences become slow-motion partway through them, then revert to normal speed as they continue. Xander's dream features mismatches between sound and image: characters are sometimes shown not speaking even as their voices are heard. Additionally, silence is used frequently, to both reflect the characters' <b>disorientation</b> and to unsettle the audience. Whedon cited films by Steven Soderbergh as his main inspirations for the odd editing, especially The Limey and The Underneath. He also listed Orson Welles' version of The Trial and Stanley Kubrick's Eyes Wide Shut as inspirations for many of his shooting and editing decisions.|$|E

He {{is the recipient of}} a 2013 Arts Writers Grant from Creative Capital/the Warhol Foundation. A collection of his art criticism, <b>Disorientations,</b> was published in 2008; subsequently, Jeppesen launched disorientations.com, a [...] "one-man art magazine." [...] In October 2011, Jeppesen announced that he would be shifting the focus of the website to explore his notion of object-oriented writing, [...] "a new form - neither poetic nor art-critical, yet retaining characteristics of both - that attempts to inhabit the object. That is, a writing that positions itself within the work of art, and also including all the necessary contradictions and impossibilities embedded within such an approach." [...] Object-oriented writing could {{be thought of as a}} parallel creative practice to object-oriented ontology. As of 2013, <b>Disorientations</b> also includes links to Jeppesen's published art reviews and essays online, as well as miscellaneous poetry, fiction, and essays he has written, much of it previously only available in print form.|$|R
5|$|Like most flight {{instructors}} giving dual instruction, Reid {{was seated}} on the right side, while the aircraft's primary flight instruments were mounted on the left, in front of Dubroff in this case. Investigators speculated {{that because of the}} heavy rain in his immediate climb path, Reid's forward visibility became greatly restricted. To maintain control through the climbing right turn, {{he would have had to}} turn his head to the left to see the flight instruments (most critically the attitude and airspeed indicators) and to the right to see the ground through the side window. Such side-to-side head motion, combined with the worsening flight visibility during the climb and the reduced stall margin, could have led to spatial <b>disorientation</b> and loss of control.|$|E
5|$|The Eurasian {{sparrowhawk}} {{population in}} Europe crashed {{in the second}} half of the 20th century. The decline coincided with the introduction of cyclodiene insecticides – aldrin, dieldrin and heptachlor – used as seed dressings in agriculture in 1956. The chemicals accumulated in the bodies of grain-eating birds and had two effects on top predators like the Eurasian sparrowhawk and peregrine falcon: the shells of eggs they laid were too thin, causing them to break during incubation; and birds were poisoned by lethal concentrations of the insecticides. Sub-lethal effects of these substances include irritability, convulsions and <b>disorientation.</b> In west Germany, around 80% of nests before the 1950s produced young, but only 54% were successful in the 1960s and '70s.|$|E

40|$|Parameters of sub-structure {{of single}} {{crystals}} of low-alloyed tungsten alloys {{from the system}} W-Nb and W-Mo were investigated after thermal cycling in argon protective atmosphere. The mode of thermal cycling of tungsten based single crystals consisted of heating to the temperature of 2500 °C and of cooling to the temperature of 500 °C with dwell of 3. 5 s at those temperature. It was established with use of X-ray topography, OLM and SEM, that after 100 thermocycles dislocations were re-distributed, sub-boundaries of the 2 nd order were “washed away” (disappeared), {{and the size of}} sub-grains of the 1 st order and their angle <b>disorientations</b> increased – as a result of heat stresses. After 500 thermocycles formation of new boundaries was observed in the structure as a result of polygonisation, i. e. by ordering of dislocations of the same sign.

5|$|The {{result of}} {{breathing}} increased partial pressures of oxygen is hyperoxia, {{an excess of}} oxygen in body tissues. The body is affected in different ways {{depending on the type}} of exposure. Central nervous system toxicity is caused by short exposure to high partial pressures of oxygen at greater than atmospheric pressure. Pulmonary and ocular toxicity result from longer exposure to increased oxygen levels at normal pressure. Symptoms may include <b>disorientation,</b> breathing problems, and vision changes such as myopia. Prolonged exposure to above-normal oxygen partial pressures, or shorter exposures to very high partial pressures, can cause oxidative damage to cell membranes, collapse of the alveoli in the lungs, retinal detachment, and seizures. Oxygen toxicity is managed by reducing the exposure to increased oxygen levels. Studies show that, in the long term, a robust recovery from most types of oxygen toxicity is possible.|$|E
5|$|This {{species is}} partly migratory, northernmost populations deserting their {{breeding}} areas in winter. Birds winter in Europe and Asia {{south of the}} breeding range.

Spring migration is complete by late March on the Mediterranean islands, but continues to late April or early May in northern Europe. The spring passage is much lighter than in autumn, suggesting high mortality on migration.|$|E

40|$|Inhomogeneities {{of plastic}} {{deformation}} {{result in the}} formation of different types of dis-location boundaries. With respect to their origin and properties two main types are dis-tinguished: incidental dislocation boundaries (IDBs) and geometrically necessary boundaries (GNBs). Both types of boundaries are connected with <b>disorientations,</b> which are lower across IDBs than across GNBs. Thick IDBs result in long-range internal stresses causing a broadening of monochromatic X-ray diffraction reflections both in radial direction of the diffraction vector and in orientation space. GNBs arise from dif-ferences in the activated slip systems {{on both sides of the}} boundary. Their diffracted intensity distribution becomes highly anisotropic in reciprocal space. The different functional behaviour of monochromatic intensity distributions for IDBs and GNBs can be used to track their evolution during plastic deformation. 1...|$|R
