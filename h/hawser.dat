5|$|Towing two scows at {{the time}} of the collision, Stella Maris responded {{immediately}} to the fire, anchoring the barges and steaming back towards Pier 6. The tug's captain, Horatio H. Brannen, and his crew realized they were not equipped to fight the fire with their one small hose and quickly backed off from the burning Mont Blanc. They were approached by a whaler from HMS Highflyer and later a steam pinnace belonging to HMCS Niobe. Captain Brannen and Albert Mattison of Niobe agreed to secure a line to the French ship's stern so as to pull it away from the pier to avoid setting it on fire. The five-inch (127-millimetre) <b>hawser</b> initially produced was deemed too small and orders for a ten-inch (254-millimetre) <b>hawser</b> came down. It was at this point that the blast occurred.|$|E
5|$|Several {{fatalities}} {{occurred during}} {{the construction of the}} bridge. A baulk of timber fell on one man when a rope slipped, and another died when he fell from the part-completed structure, injuring himself on the staging as he fell. Only {{a few days after the}} bridge's opening, a rowing boat trying to pass underneath was caught in a giant eddy and capsized, one occupant being drowned. Over the succeeding years a number of accidents have happened at the bridge involving larger vessels. The trow Brothers was lost after a collision with one of the piers in 1879, and the Victoria, employed in the bridge's construction, was wrecked in the 1880s. In 1938, a tug and two barges got into difficulties and were carried along broadside by the tide into the bridge; a connecting <b>hawser</b> snagged one of the piers and the vessels capsized, with several fatalities.|$|E
25|$|On 8 May Comus {{sent her}} boats into the harbour of Gran Canaria, which was defended {{by a strong}} fort and two shore batteries. There they cut out a large armed felucca, which was flying His Catholic Majesty's colours. The {{boarding}} party, {{under the command of}} Lieutenant Watts, cleared her deck of her crew and the boats started to pull her out (the Spaniards had taken the precaution of removing her rudder and sails and taking them on shore), when a tug-of-war developed as men on the quay pulled on a <b>hawser.</b> Eventually the boarding party cut the <b>hawser</b> and the boats succeeded in pulling the felucca out, an operation they conducted under fire. The felucca was the packet ship San Pedro de Apostol, which had been carrying bale goods from Cadiz to Buenos Ayres. On her way, San Pedro de Apostol had captured the Lord Keith, which had been sailing from London to Mogador.|$|E

25|$|On 29 September, Savannah sailed for Kronstadt on {{the first}} leg of her journey home. After {{experiencing}} several days of rough weather while at Kronstadt, during which the ship lost an anchor and <b>hawser,</b> Savannah left Kronstadt under steam on October 10 bound for Copenhagen, Denmark, arriving on the 17th.

25|$|The Times of July 7, 1905 {{records that}} at 9am on July 7, divers reached the Farfadet {{and found that}} the crew were {{responding}} to knocks. Four <b>hawser</b> (steel) cables were wrapped around the submarine in preparation for the arrival of a 20-ton pontoon and crane, belonging to the Hersen Company. At 3.20pm the vessel was raised, its aft portion breaking the water so that airlocks could be opened and the air inside renewed for the surviving crew. Attempts were then made to ground the submarine in shallow water, but at 12.45 the next morning the crane broke, sending the submarine back {{to the bottom of the}} harbour. Further efforts to recover it, involving the French steamer Audax, were in vain.|$|E
25|$|Meanwhile, the Star of Bengals crew {{also became}} concerned, but could neither see the tugboats, nor {{communicate}} with them. At 1:45a.m. the Hattie Gage blew {{a series of}} whistles, signaling the maneuver which was heard on the Star of Bengal. However, as the tugs started the turn, the Kayaks rudder proved ineffective in the rough weather, and she failed to turn into the wind. For some time, the tugs worked against each other, their combined effort overpowering the Star of Bengals rudder and preventing her from making the turn to safety. Aware of the looming danger, the Star of Bengals first mate begged captain Wagner to sever the Kayaks <b>hawser</b> which was dragging the ship in the wrong direction, but the captain refused, as the maritime law prohibited such action {{on the part of}} the vessel in tow.|$|E

25|$|For {{display of}} {{extraordinary}} heroism {{in the line}} of his profession above and {{beyond the call of duty}} during the diving operations in connection with the sinking in a depth of water 304 feet, of the U.S.S. F-4 with all on board, as a result of loss of depth control, which occurred off Honolulu, T.H., on 25 March 1915. On 17 April 1915, William F. Loughman, chief gunner's mate, U.S. Navy, who had descended to the wreck and had examined one of the wire hawsers attached to it, upon starting his ascent, and when at a depth of 250 feet beneath the surface of the water, had his lifeline and air hose so badly fouled by this <b>hawser</b> that he was unable to free himself; he could neither ascend nor descend. On account of the length of time that Loughman had already been subjected to the great pressure due to the depth of water, and of the uncertainty of the additional time he would have to be subjected to this pressure before he could be brought to the surface, it was imperative that steps be taken at once to clear him. Instantly, realizing the desperate case of his comrade, Crilley volunteered to go to his aid, immediately donned a diving suit and descended. After a lapse of time of 2 hours and 11 minutes, Crilley was brought to the surface, having by a superb exhibition of skill, coolness, endurance and fortitude, untangled the snarl of lines and cleared his imperiled comrade, so that he was brought, still alive, to the surface.|$|E
500|$|On 20 July 1870, Admiral Chichagov {{struck a}} {{sandbank}} near Koivisto at full speed.

While rigging another <b>hawser</b> aboard Strelets, it moved unexpectedly, badly injuring the ship's executive officer and a bosun, who later died of his injuries. The subsequent attempt by Sevastopol also failed, so several barges and a floating crane were summoned from Kronstadt the next day. As much weight as possible was transferred to the barges, including her forward guns, and she was successfully pulled free on 25 July. Admiral Chichagov was not damaged in the incident.|$|E
500|$|The ship {{struck a}} rock in Cavalaire Bay, off Cavalaire-sur-Mer, on 4 February 1903 after straying outside the channel, and ripped a hole [...] {{in the bottom of}} the hull.

The <b>hawser</b> broke after only moving Espingole roughly , injuring two of Hallebardes crewmen. Hallebarde then rescued Espingoles 62-man crew before the ship sank at coordinates [...] LV Marcotte de Sainte-Marie was finally acquitted at his court-martial seven years after his ship ran aground.|$|E
60|$|Then {{they got}} to their ship and to their oars, and Tiphys bade them cast off the <b>hawsers</b> and go to sea.

500|$|The Grade II listed {{statue of}} Lord Nelson, an Old Norvicensian, was sculpted by Thomas Milnes in 1847. Milnes was later asked {{to model the}} lions for the base of Nelson's Column in Trafalgar Square, but the {{commission}} was eventually given to Sir Edwin Landseer. Nelson is depicted in vice admiral full-dress uniform, with epaulettes and three stars on the cuff, resting a telescope on a cannon with a <b>hawser</b> at his feet. He lost most of his right arm in 1797, shown by his empty right sleeve which is pinned to his uniform to support the cloak which falls from his left shoulder. The octagonal granite plinth is inscribed with [...] "Nelson". It was originally located outside the Norwich Guildhall but was relocated to its current site next to the school in the Upper Close in 1856 {{at the suggestion of}} the sculptor Richard Westmacott the Younger.|$|E
500|$|Callaghan's next posting was to {{the cruiser}} [...] in November 1916. Following the entry of the United States into World War I, in April 1917, the New Orleans escorted cargo ships {{crossing}} the Atlantic Ocean. It was {{at this time that}} he first met Ross McIntire, a surgeon, who would later {{have a significant impact on}} his career. According to biographer Francis Murphy, Callaghan played a pivotal role in the rescue of a disabled British liner off the coast of Ireland: [...] "Four times a <b>hawser</b> was hauled aboard the cruiser from the liner, that was about three times the cruiser's size, and four times the cable parted. The Captain was for abandoning the job. But not Dan. With superhuman strength and the full cooperation of his men, he finally secured the cable. For forty-eight hours the New Orleans stayed with the stricken vessel hauling it out of danger [...] finally handing it on to tugs from a North Ireland base." ...|$|E

500|$|Another fleet advance {{followed}} on 18–20October, {{though it}} ended without encountering any British units. Two weeks later, on 4November, Prinzregent Luitpold {{took part in}} an expedition to the western coast of Denmark to assist two U-boats— and —that had become stranded there. The fleet was reorganized on 1December; the four König-class battleships remained in IIISquadron, along with the newly commissioned , while the five Kaiser-class ships, including Prinzregent Luitpold, were transferred to IVSquadron. Prinzregent Luitpold became the flagship of the new squadron. In the Wilhelmshaven Roads on 20January 1917, the ship struck a steel <b>hawser</b> that became entangled in the ship's starboard propeller. In March, Friedrich der Grosse was replaced as the fleet flagship by the newly commissioned battleship [...] Friedrich der Grosse in turn replaced Prinzregent Luitpold as the flagship of IVSquadron. Steadily decreasing morale and discontent with rations provoked {{a series of small}} mutinies in the fleet. On 6June and 19July, stokers protested the low quality of the food they were given, and on 2August, some 800men went on a hunger strike. The ship's officers relented and agreed to form a Menagekommission, a council that gave the enlisted men a voice in their ration selection and preparation. One of the ringleaders of the protests, however, was arrested and executed on 5September.|$|E
500|$|Lieutenant-Colonel David Parker {{ended his}} tenure as RLI {{commanding}} officer on 30 November 1975, when {{he was promoted to}} Colonel. Less than a month later, on 23 December, he was killed in a helicopter crash near Cashel, just south of Umtali, along with three other officers: Major-General John Shaw, Captain John Lamb and Captain Ian Robinson. A South African Air Force Alouette III piloted by Air Sub-Lieutenant Johannes van Rensburg was flying the four officers from Umtali to Melsetter, with Sergeant Pieter van Rensburg (no relation) also aboard as flight technician. Flying at low altitude, in keeping with procedure, the helicopter flew into a rusty, long forgotten <b>hawser</b> cable, unmarked on any maps and years before used to pass logs down a steep slope. The aircraft broke up, spun out of control and crashed. All on board were killed except for the pilot, who was seriously injured, losing one of his legs. Historians Hannes Wessels and P. J. H. Petter-Bowyer agree that the deaths of these men, and Parker in particular, affected the course of the conflict in the guerrillas' favour: Shaw was Rhodesia's [...] "next Army Commander", says Petter-Bowyer, and Parker [...] "its finest field commander". The Colonel was [...] "earmarked for bigger things", Wessels writes, [...] "... his loss was a considerable blow to the [...] war effort." ...|$|E
