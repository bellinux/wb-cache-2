5000|$|Automotive tests {{itself to}} enhance safety and reliability. For example, most {{vehicles}} with antilock brakes test them once per safety interval. If the antilock brake system has a broken wire or other fault, the brake system reverts to operating {{as a normal}} brake system. Most automotive engine controllers incorporate a [...] "limp mode" [...] for each sensor, so that the engine will continue to operate if the sensor or its wiring fails. Another, more trivial example of a limp mode is that some cars test <b>door</b> <b>switches,</b> and automatically turn lights on using seat-belt occupancy sensors if the <b>door</b> <b>switches</b> fail.|$|R

50|$|An {{air curtain}} may {{pay for itself}} {{in a few years}} by {{reducing}} the load on the building's heating or air conditioning system. Usually, there is a mechanism, such as a <b>door</b> <b>switch,</b> to turn the unit on and off as the door opens and closes, so the air curtain only operates while the door is open.|$|E
50|$|The first {{experiments}} with an RFID implant {{were carried out}} in 1998 by the British scientist Kevin Warwick. His implant was used to open <b>doors,</b> <b>switch</b> on lights, and cause verbal output within a building. After nine days the implant was removed and has since been held in the Science Museum (London).|$|R
5000|$|<b>Door</b> <b>switches</b> {{are simple}} on/off {{mechanisms}} {{connected to the}} interior light (dome light), and may also be connected to a warning light, speaker or other device, to inform the driver when the door is not closed. The door light is standard equipment on all cars. In American cars from the 1950s-1990s, they had buzzers or [...] "door dingers" [...] that sounded, along with the check light, whenever any door is open.|$|R

50|$|The Door Control Unit is {{responsible}} for controlling and monitoring various electronic accessories in a vehicle's door. Since most of the vehicles {{have more than one}} door, generally DCUs are present in each door separately. A DCU associated with the driver's door has some additional functionalities. This additional features are the result of complex functions like locking, driver <b>door</b> <b>switch</b> pad, child lock switches, etc., which are associated with the driver's door. In most of the cases driver door module acts as a master and others act as slaves in communication protocols.|$|E
50|$|The {{first person}} shooter levels are {{extremely}} simple compared to most {{games in the}} genre: there are no <b>doors,</b> <b>switches,</b> or health or ammunition pickups, and the player has only one weapon (a pistol) with unlimited ammunition. In lieu of health pickups, John Spartan slowly recovers health over time. The level designs are on a two dimensional square grid and are maze-like, with {{a great number of}} branching paths. The player's objective is to reach a specific location within the level.|$|R
50|$|Both manufacturers' units look {{exceptionally}} {{similar in}} design; the major noticeable differences for passengers are {{the lack of}} aircraft-style overhead air vents on those produced by GEC Alsthom (465/2), and the BREL (465/0) and ABB (465/1) units also feature slightly different dot matrix displays {{on the front and}} rear of the train to show the route number and destination, compared to the GEC Alsthom units. There are other visible but minor differences in <b>door</b> <b>switches</b> and audible chimes, window shapes and exterior panelling amongst the fleet.|$|R
25|$|Dominance is {{a strong}} reason to seek for a {{solution}} among always-switching strategies, under fairly general assumptions on {{the environment in which}} the contestant is making decisions. In particular, if the car is hidden by means of some randomization device – like tossing symmetric or asymmetric three-sided die – the dominance implies that a strategy maximizing the probability of winning the car will be among three always-switching strategies, namely it will be the strategy that initially picks the least likely <b>door</b> then <b>switches</b> no matter which <b>door</b> to <b>switch</b> is offered by the host.|$|R

50|$|An {{access control}} point {{can be a}} door, turnstile, parking gate, elevator, or other {{physical}} barrier, where granting access can be electronically controlled. Typically, the access point is a door. An electronic access control door can contain several elements. At its most basic, there is a stand-alone electric lock. The lock is unlocked by an operator with a switch. To automate this, operator intervention {{is replaced by a}} reader. The reader could be a keypad where a code is entered, it could be a card reader, or it could be a biometric reader. Readers do not usually make an access decision, but send a card number to an access control panel that verifies the number against an access list. To monitor the door position a magnetic <b>door</b> <b>switch</b> can be used. In concept, the <b>door</b> <b>switch</b> is not unlike those on refrigerators or car doors. Generally only entry is controlled, and exit is uncontrolled. In cases where exit is also controlled, a second reader is used {{on the opposite side of}} the door. In cases where exit is not controlled, free exit, a device called a request-to-exit (REX) is used. Request-to-exit devices can be a push-button or a motion detector. When the button is pushed, or the motion detector detects motion at the door, the door alarm is temporarily ignored while the door is opened. Exiting a door without having to electrically unlock the door is called mechanical free egress. This is an important safety feature. In cases where the lock must be electrically unlocked on exit, the request-to-exit device also unlocks the door.|$|E

Conway can survive long falls, but can be killed by a single gunshot, thus requiring the player {{to stay out of}} the guards' line of sight.|$|R
50|$|Almost all OEM alarms are {{typically}} armed and disarmed with the vehicle's keyless entry remote. On many vehicles the key cylinders {{in the driver}} or front passenger <b>door</b> activate <b>switches,</b> so that when a key {{is used in the}} door the alarm will arm or disarm.Some vehicles will arm when the power <b>door</b> lock <b>switch</b> is pressed with the driver's door open, and the door is subsequently closed.Some vehicles will disarm if the ignition is turned on; often when the vehicle is equipped with a key-based immobilizer and an alarm, the combination of the valid key code and the ignition disarms the system.|$|R
50|$|On {{coaching}} stock trains fitted with central door locking (slam door), {{there is no}} ‘local door’ except on the train's Guard's van. Local instructions allow the Guard to operate train doors from any location {{it is safe to}} do so, or where regulations require them to do so. Once it is required, the Guard can lock all doors without requiring closing their door, as the locking bolt does not activate until the door is closed. Coaching stock trains with power doors, like the Mark 4 used on the East Coast Main Line, have local <b>door</b> <b>switches</b> at all <b>door</b> control panel locations.|$|R
50|$|The dragon blasts its way {{out from}} the {{basement}} and David runs back into the lab, Dr. Winter then tells that the dragon has blasted the entire system, causing an automatic lockdown and trapping them. Bailey tells everybody that the dragon is getting hungry {{and that it will}} wander around to search for food and a nest, it is also warm-blooded (much like the dinosaurs) and that it needs to keep itself cool, so the scientists have to revert the cooling system to a different spot in the facility to lure the dragon away from the elevator. To do this, they need a laptop, which is in Kevin's room, so David orders Kevin to come with him because he {{is the only one who}} can open it, at first he refuses to go but after being threatened by David, he agrees to go with him. They finally make it into his room but Kevin then insists that he wants to stay, David leaves him (calling him a stupid-ass idiot), grabs the laptop and heads out. Kevin plays some music, which attracts the dragon towards David, who shoots at it and barely escapes back through a vent. The dragon then slams the side of Kevin's room; he gets angry and opens the door, but sees nothing. He then hears something outside again and hits the <b>door</b> <b>switch</b> with a baseball bat. He finds the dragon there, which quickly kills and eats him.|$|E
30|$|Apart from integer and boolean datatype, {{five new}} data types are {{introduced}} to support the mentioned objects, namely, NOType, MOType, Location, NOStateType, MOStateType, NOID and MOID. NOType defines the type (ex: cabinet, <b>door,</b> <b>switch)</b> of non-movable object with ID defined in data type NOID. Likewise, MOType defines the type (towel, paper, cup) of movable object with ID defined in data type MOID. Location is the datatype of location.MOStateType and NOStateType are the datatype that defines the state of a movable and non-movable object respectively.|$|E

5000|$|This {{style of}} tamper {{resistance}} is most {{commonly found in}} burglar alarms. Most trip devices (e.g. pressure pads, passive infrared sensors (motion detectors), <b>door</b> <b>switches)</b> use two signal wires that, depending on configuration, are normally open or normally closed. The sensors sometimes need power, so to simplify cable runs, multi-core cable is used. While 4 cores is normally enough for devices that require power (leaving two spare for those that don't), cable with additional cores can be used. These additional cores can be wired into a special so-called [...] "tamper circuit" [...] in the alarm system.|$|R

40|$|A vapor {{compression}} refrigerator/freezer {{has been}} designed for Spacelab to conduct life sciences experiments. It is equipped with different safety features to eliminate all probable types of failures. The whole Freon loop is enclosed in a second containment so that any leakage of Freon can be contained. The unit is provided with an 'Emergency On' switch to actuate during backup mode which provides the spacecraft power directly to the compressor and the cooling fans while removing the power supply and all normal control elements from the circuit. During this mode, the compressor runs continuously when operating as a freezer (- 22 C) and is controlled by a thermostat to cycle when operating as a refrigerator (4 C). It has a push button switch at the front panel to momentarily power the thermometer by a battery to monitor the inside temperature during an emergency. It has a <b>door</b> <b>switch</b> which shuts off the internal cooling fans when the door is opened. All the important critical performance data will be downlinked through a data connector to monitor during mission...|$|E
40|$|This paper {{describes}} {{the logic of}} a microprocessor-controlled thermostat termed 'comfortstat' {{to address the needs}} of temporary room occupants such as hotel guests while reducing energy consumption. The 'comfortstat' design grew out of a study of thermal control in a luxury hotel in San Francisco, California, USA. Hotel guests frequently arrive from widely disparate climates and have high expectation so of the thermal environment. Their short-term occupancy (for periods ranging from one day to several weeks) provides a unique challenge for thermal comfort control. We examined the hotel complaint log, collected detailed physical measurements of the thermal environment in typical hotel rooms, assessed the HVAC (heating, venting and air-conditioning) system capacity and response time, and surveyed 315 hotel guests over a five-month period. The results of this study led to the design of a thermostat control system (the 'thermostat') what would solve the most serious problems. The 'comfortstat' integrates an infrared occupancy sensor, <b>door</b> <b>switch,</b> radiant temperature sensor, and control logical to optimize room conditions while 'learning' about the occupant's preferred comfort zone. This paper focuses on how the joint requirements of the guests and the hotel management guided the design of the 'comfortstat' for increased occupant satisfaction and lower energy use in the hotel. The concepts are completely generic and could be applied to the design of comfort systems for other types of short term occupancy. We present control logic flowcharts and typical examples of hotel 'comfortstat' in response to data received from the physical environment and/or human input...|$|E
40|$|Laying hens in loose-housing systems {{select a}} nest daily {{in which to}} lay their eggs among many {{identical}} looking nests, they often prefer corner nests. We investigated whether heterogeneity in nest curtain appearance – via colours and symbols – would influence nest selection and result in an even distribution of eggs among nests. We studied pre-laying behaviour in groups of 30 LSL hens across two consecutive trials with eight groups per trial. Half of the groups had access to six identical rollaway group-nests, while the others had access to six nests of the same type differing in outer appearance. Three colours (red, green, yellow) and three black symbols (cross, circle, rectangle) were used to create three different nest curtain designs per pen. Nest position and the side of entrance to the pens were changed at 28 and 30 weeks of age, respectively, whereby the order of changes was counterbalanced across trials. Nest positions were numbered 1 – 6, with nest position 1 representing the nest closest to the pen entrance. Eggs were counted per nest daily from week of age 18 to 33. Nest visits were recorded individually with an RFID system for the first 5 h of light throughout weeks 24 – 33. Hens with access to nests differing in curtain appearance entered fewer nests daily than hens with identical nests throughout the study but both groups entered more nests with increasing age. We found no other evidence that curtain appearance affected nest choice and hens were inconsistent in their daily nest selection. A high proportion of eggs were laid in corner nests especially {{during the first three}} weeks of lay. The number of visits per egg depended upon nest position and age: it increased with age and was higher after the nest position change than before in nest position 1, whereas it stayed stable over time in nest position 6. At 24 weeks of age, gregarious nest visits (hens visiting an occupied nest when there was at least one unoccupied nest) and solitary nest visits (hens visiting an unoccupied nest when there was at least one occupied nest) accounted for a similar amount of nest visits, however, after the <b>door</b> <b>switch,</b> gregarious nest visits made up {{more than half of all}} nest visits, while the number of solitary nest visits had decreased. The visual cues were too subtle or inadequate for hens to develop individual preferences while nest position, entrance side, age and nest occupancy affected the quantity and type of nest visits...|$|E
