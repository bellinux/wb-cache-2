40|$|The {{production}} of political talk is changing {{in response to}} ongoing changes in the overall media ecology. The rise of web TV challenges the previously dominant mediated politics of traditional broadcasting. In this paper we examine the practices of the mediatization of politics in the web TV environment via a humorous encounter between a self-declared “prankster” posing as a web TV broadcaster, and several Swedish politicians. The discussion reflects on various data emanating from this encounter to reveal how Web TV challenges traditional <b>broadcasting</b> <b>norms,</b> and offers fresh challenges for politicians who are continuously adapting to new media logics for exposure.

5000|$|The dismal {{ratings were}} {{followed}} by a format change at 5 pm on June 18, 2002: KAZL began stunting with all-commercials ("All Commercials, All the Time, KAZL"). Steven Szalay, operations manager, an established A/V producer and stockholder in Sierra <b>H</b> <b>Broadcasting,</b> Inc, created an entire radio format complete with sweepers, liners, ID's and live DJ comments {{as well as a}} collection of classic radio commercials- his [...] "theory" [...] was that since all the most popular stations played lots of commercials, a station that played commercials all the time would shoot to the top in no time. The station received many calls asking if this was serious; some called to express their appreciation of the joke, and some believed it pleading and demanding that the classic hits format be returned.|$|R
50|$|The {{song was}} also used on another Los Angeles {{television}} station, KABC-TV Channel 7, when the station would sign on {{in the early morning}} to begin its broadcast day well before round-the-clock <b>broadcasting</b> became the <b>norm</b> much later.|$|R

Since that time, 107.9 FM has had several different formats and call signs ranging from Adult Contemporary, rock, country as WRRB, easy listening/classical as WRHP, and lastly Hit Country 108 WHEN-FM.|$|R

5000|$|The Lancasters {{sold off}} their radio {{interests}} in 1960, {{and in turn}} sold WJHL-TV to Roy <b>H.</b> Park <b>Broadcasting</b> in 1964--earning a handsome return on John H. Lancaster's original investment from 26 years earlier. [...] Around this time, the station adopted a logo featuring a U.S. highway sign with an [...] "11" [...] inside it, which remained in use until around 1987. The logo was already {{well known in the}} area, since alternate routes of U.S. Highway 11, U.S. Highways 11-E and 11-W pass through most of the major cities and towns in the Tri-Cities. The shields were, and still are, quite prevalent in the area and became an instant promotional link for the station. Park Broadcasting was renamed Park Communications in the 1970s.|$|R
5000|$|The Outlet Company {{reached a}} {{long-term}} affiliation agreement with NBC that renewed the network's contracts with Outlet's two existing NBC affiliates, WJAR-TV (channel 10) in Providence and WCMH-TV (channel 4) in Columbus, Ohio. As {{part of the}} deal, Outlet also agreed to switch WNCN (channel 17) in Goldsboro, North Carolina - which the group purchased from Group <b>H</b> <b>Broadcasting</b> for $5.4 million in May 1994 - to NBC. WNCN had been a charter affiliate of The WB for nine {{months prior to the}} switch, but also carried select NBC programs that had been pre-empted by the network's existing Raleigh-Durham affiliate, WRDC (channel 28, now a MyNetworkTV affiliate), which had been one of NBC's lowest-rated affiliates throughout its tenure with the network. When WNCN joined NBC on September 3, 1995 (one month earlier than its originally announced date of October 1), WRDC affiliated with UPN, while the WB affiliation moved to upstart WRAZ (channel 50, now a Fox affiliate) when that station signed on four days later on September 7. Outlet sold its broadcasting holdings to NBC's owned-and-operated station group, NBC Television Stations, for $396 million in August 1995 (beating out an initial purchase bid by Renaissance Broadcasting), resulting in WNCN becoming that network's first owned-and-operated station on the UHF band since 1959, when it sold WNBC (channel 30) in New Britain, Connecticut to Plains Television in June of that year (NBC would repurchase that station, by then known as WVIT, in July 1997 from the Paramount Stations Group). On February 29, 2016, through an affiliation agreement with Media General (which acquired WNCN as part of its purchase of four NBC O&Os located in mid-sized markets in 2006), WNCN switched to CBS, trading network affiliations with WRAL-TV (channel 5) {{as a result of a}} disagreement during contract renewal negotiations between WRAL owner Capitol Broadcasting Company and CBS over terms of increasing the share of retransmission revenue that the station would pay the latter (the deal reunited NBC with WRAL, which had previously served as its original Raleigh-Durham affiliate from 1956 to 1968).|$|R
50|$|WPLY {{launched}} {{with the}} callsign WSLS just before noon on October 1, 1940. For over 50 years, the station would carry a Country format. At one time, the now defunct Roy <b>H.</b> Park <b>Broadcasting</b> had owned WSLS-AM-FM-TV, but sold the radio stations because Park also owned {{a newspaper in}} Roanoke. After the purchase, the AM became WSLC at midnight on August 1, 1972, but stayed Country, and the FM became Rock WSLQ). Only the TV station still carries the original WSLS letters. At noon on May 25, 2000, the station began simulcasting it new sister station, the former easy listening turned classic rock station WPVR, which was flipped to Country as WSLC-FM, after being purchased by Mel Wheeler Inc. This continued until March 13, 2002, when WSLC was flipped to new calls as WVBE, simulcasting co-owned WVBE-FM Lynchburg, and brought R&B music full-time to Roanoke.|$|R
40|$|This paper {{attempts}} to reconstitute {{the structure and}} legal benefits of “freedom of broadcasting”in Japan's Constitutional Law．This freedom has been debated {{from a variety of}} perspectives to justify broadcasting regulation．However, it appears that traditional academic theories have numerous difficulties in the face of structural changes to the mass media as a result of technological innovations and developments of market mechanisms in the broadcasting arena. Examples include the progress of multichannel services, the Internet, and the convergence between communications and broadcasting．Therefore, it is important to focus on intrinsic aspects of broadcasting such as the nature of the onesided transmission of information to the general public（principally as a business），rather than the transformative aspects of broadcasting such as its historical or social functions．From this perspective, freedom of <b>broadcasting</b> includes a <b>norm</b> to ensure smooth transmission of information and a certain degree of order about what is transmitted as a part of freedom of communications．The resulting freedom of business for broadcasters helps to retain stability and diversity of information supply． Hence freedom of broadcasting can be distinguished from the freedoms held by other media; freedom of newspapers and freedom of the Internet, even though they perhaps should be treated equally in light of freedom of expression．Therefore, it would be fair to note that the current severe regulations on broadcasting under existing legislation are constitutional despite their asymmetrical features compared with other media such as newspapers. 杉原敏夫教授定年退職記念号In Honour of Prof. Toshio Sugihar...|$|R
40|$|Together {{with the}} reform of the {{criminal}} justice it was necessary to form a complex system of activities concerning the realization and effective usage of the introduced system of alternative punishments and deviations in criminal proceedings. On the basis of this requirement the institution of the Probation and Mediation Service (PMS) of the Czech Republic was established in 2001. The mission of the PMS is to create conditions for alternative punishments use {{in the course of the}} criminal proceedings and to ensure the effective execution of alternative punishments. For this purpose this service carries out the probation and mediation and participates in settlement of disputes between the accused and accusers and makes efforts to appease conflict situations and to restore the respect for rules of law. The integral part of the PMS mission is prevention and reducing the risk of the recurrence of criminal activity. The objective of the thesis is to examine the real public awareness of the Probation and Mediation Service of the Czech Republic, to give account of the lay public attitudes to the institution of alternative punishments. The thesis also studies opinions of alternative punishments in professionals who cooperate with the Probation and Mediation Service. Before the research the following hypotheses were stated: H I: The awareness of the lay public of the Probation and Mediation Service is low. Partial H I: The lay public gets information mostly through the television <b>broadcasting.</b> <b>H</b> II: The cooperation of professionals with the Probation and Mediation Service influences the attitude to alternative punishments, which become more acceptable to be imposed. To verify the hypotheses the quantitative research, the questionnaire method was used. I made up standardised questionnaires with a series of 15 questions. The first research set was composed of the lay public. 100 persons aged 20 { [...] } 60 years were chosen at random. The other research set comprised staff members of subjects cooperating with the Probation and Mediation Service of the Police of the Czech Republic, of local and municipal authorities, of the Employment Office, of the prison system. 50 persons were addressed on the whole. The results show that the H I as well as the partial H I, relating to the awareness of the lay public of the Probation and Mediation Service, were confirmed. The hypothesis II, focused on attitudes of professionals cooperating with the PMS to alternative punishments, was rejected...|$|R
