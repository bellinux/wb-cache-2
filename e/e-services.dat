The purpose of this paper is to review research and is to gather conceptual perspectives on the role and nature of <b>e-service,</b> and the <b>e-service</b> experience. Recent advances in technology have created a surge in technology-based self-service or <b>e-service,</b> and there is an increasing recognition of its role in differentiation and customer interfaces. In order to understand <b>e-service</b> experiences it is necessary to go beyond studies of <b>e-service</b> quality dimensions and to also take into account the inherent characteristics of <b>e-service</b> delivery and the factors that differentiate one service experience from another. The paper reviews the factors that impact on the nature of the <b>e-service</b> experience, taking a wider perspective than that adopted by many researcher on <b>e-service</b> when they focus on the identification of the dimensions of <b>e-service</b> quality. In order to manage the <b>e-service</b> experience it is important to develop a clear articulation of the nature, boundaries, components and elements of specific <b>e-service</b> experiences, and to further investigate the interaction between these factors and service quality dimensions...|$|R

During scientific literature analysis we identified 14 <b>e-service</b> quality dimensions forming three scales: 1) a core <b>e-service</b> quality scale, 2) <b>e-service</b> quality recovery scale, and 3) website quality scale. These scales were tested empirically in quantitative research using online survey method. However, the empirical research results do not supported the suggested three scales. The findings show that <b>e-service</b> quality from customers’ perspective is a four-dimensional construct, i. e. composed of four dimensions: 1) compensation, 2) responsiveness and fulfillment, 3) website operation, and 4) reliability. The exploratory and confirmatory factor analysis confirmed the validity and reliability of the four-dimensional construct.

40|$|Abstract—E-service quality plays a {{significant}} role to achieve success or failure in any organization, offering services online. It will increase the competition among the organizations, to attract the customers {{on the basis of the}} quality of service provided by the organization. Better <b>e-service</b> quality will enhance the relationship with customers and their satisfaction. So the measurement of <b>e-service</b> quality is very important but it is a complex process due to the complex nature of services. Literature predicts that there is a lack of universal definition of <b>e-service</b> quality. The <b>e-service</b> quality measures in banking have great importance in achieving high customer base. This paper proposes a conceptual model for measuring <b>e-service</b> quality in Indian Banking Industry. Nine dimensions reliability, ease of use, personalization, security and trust, website aesthetic, responsiveness, contact and fulfillment had been identified. The results of this paper may help to develop a proper scale to measure the <b>e-service</b> quality in Indian Banking Industry, which may assist to maintain and improve the performance and effectiveness of <b>e-service</b> quality to retain customers...|$|R

The results of the empirical evaluation indicate a greater inter-rater consistency when the adapted/objective measure is used for evaluation of the efficiency dimension of <b>e-service</b> quality...|$|R

Further analysis strongly suggest that continuance is determined solely by the higher perceived usefulness of the <b>e-service</b> while service quality is more effective at lower levels of perceived usefulness.
