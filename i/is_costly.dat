5|$|Fertility {{control is}} a {{non-lethal}} method of population management that is usually viewed as the most humane treatment, and its use {{is supported by the}} RSPCA. While it appears as though these treatments are effective in the breeding season immediately following injection, the lasting effects are debated. Because it <b>is</b> <b>costly</b> and difficult to treat animals repeatedly, this method, despite being ideal, is not widely implemented.|$|E
5|$|Generally, justice <b>is</b> <b>costly</b> {{to provide}} and many legal systems, {{especially}} in Asia, are fraught with {{issues such as}} weak legal institutions, corrupt and incompetent administrative officers and judges, excessive delays and limited access to justice stemming from high legal costs {{and the lack of}} legal aid. It was agreed during the World Justice Forum in 2008 that access to justice is key to advancing the rule of law.|$|E

5|$|Sam Brown and W. D. Hamilton and Marco Archetti {{proposed}} that autumn leaf colour is {{a signal from}} trees to aphids and other pest species that migrate in autumn to the trees. In their theory, bright autumn coloration with pinks and yellows <b>is</b> <b>costly</b> to trees because pigments require energy to synthesize, but the investment may help them to reduce their parasite load.|$|E
5|$|A {{number of}} {{protective}} {{measures have been}} implemented, including site access restrictions, the collection and cold-storage of seed, and the treatment of plants with phosphite. Phosphite boosts the resistance of both infected and uninfected plants, and also acts as a direct fungicide. Aerial spraying of phosphite boosts plant survival and slows the spread of infection, but must be carefully managed {{as studies have shown}} that foliar spraying of phosphite adversely affects root and shoot growth. Direct injection of phosphite into the stem of each tree appears to lack this disadvantage, but <b>is</b> <b>costly</b> to administer and restricted to known plants.|$|E
5|$|Damage {{and efforts}} to control the spread of emerald ash borer have {{affected}} businesses that sell ash trees or wood products, property owners, and local or state governments. Quarantines can limit the transport of ash trees and products, but economic impacts are especially high for urban and residential areas due to treatment or removal costs and decreased land value from dying trees. Costs for managing these trees can fall upon homeowners or local municipalities. For municipalities, removing large numbers of dead or infested trees at once <b>is</b> <b>costly,</b> so slowing down {{the rate at which}} trees die through removing known infested trees and treating trees with insecticides can allow local governments more time to plan, remove, and replace trees that would eventually die. This strategy saves money as it would cost $10.7 billion in urban areas of 25 states between 2009–2019, while removing and replacing all ash trees in these same areas at once would cost $25 billion. Some urban areas such as Minneapolis, Minnesota, have large amounts of ash with slightly more than 20% of their urban forest as ash.|$|E

5|$|This {{technology}} {{is widely used}} in confirming venous pathology diagnoses. The imaging capability needed, was made possible with the developments of Doppler and color Doppler. Doppler measurements using Doppler effect can show {{the direction of the}} blood flow and its relative velocity and color Doppler is the provision of color to help interpret the image, showing for example, the blood flow towards the probe in one color and that flowing away another. Whilst the equipment itself <b>is</b> <b>costly,</b> the procedure is not. Apart from the scanner, different probes are required according to the depth to be studied. A gel is used with the probe to make a good acoustic impedance contact. The training and expertise of the examiner is important because of the many technical complications that can present. Venous anatomy for example, is not constant, for example a patient's vein layout of the right limb is not identical to that of the left limb.|$|E

25|$|An {{explanation}} for the queen’s near monopoly on male production is that worker production <b>is</b> <b>costly</b> and therefore reduces total colony reproduction.

25|$|Oil {{extraction}} {{is simply}} the removal of oil from the reservoir (oil pool). Oil is often recovered as a water-in-oil emulsion, and specialty chemicals called demulsifiers are used to separate the oil from water. Oil extraction <b>is</b> <b>costly</b> and sometimes environmentally damaging. Offshore exploration and extraction of oil disturbs the surrounding marine environment.|$|E
25|$|The second {{component}} of strong reciprocity {{is that people}} are willing to punish those who fail to cooperate, even when punishment <b>is</b> <b>costly.</b> There are two types of punishment: second party and third party punishment. In second party punishment, the person who was hurt by the other parties' failure to cooperate has the opportunity to punish the non-cooperator. In third party punishment, an uninvolved third party has the opportunity to punish the non-cooperator.|$|E

25|$|As {{mentioned}} above, intermediate {{optical amplification}} sites in DWDM systems may {{allow for the}} dropping and adding of certain wavelength channels.

This <b>is</b> <b>costly,</b> and in some systems requires that all active traffic {{be removed from the}} DWDM system, because inserting or removing the wavelength-specific cards interrupts the multi-wavelength optical signal.|$|E

There were no new authors and the compositions are not renovated.

Recently, a novel three-step, multiscale, multiresolution reconstruction method is presented that directly uses 2D images {{in order to develop}} 3D models. This method, based on a Shannon Entropy and conditional simulation, can be used for most of the available stationary materials and can build various stochastic 3D models just using a few thin sections.|$|E
