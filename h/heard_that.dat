He made an agreement with the owner of a small merchant-vessel to take himself and five others back to South America, but a kind uncle heard of this and contacted the Admiralty. Soon afterwards FitzRoy <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> he was to be appointed commander of HMS Chanticleer to go to Tierra del Fuego, but due to her poor condition Beagle was substituted.

5|$|Carson {{first met}} Dorothy Freeman in the Summer of 1953 in Southport Island, Maine.

5|$|Frequent radio {{transmissions}} through the player's communications device also {{add to the}} atmosphere, by broadcasting certain sounds and messages from non-player characters meant to unsettle the player. Early in the game, during and directly after the event that plunges the base into chaos, the player often hears the sounds of fighting, screaming and dying through their radio transmitter. The ambient sound is extended to the base itself through such things as hissing pipes, footsteps, and occasional jarringly loud noises from machinery or other sources. Often ambient sounds can be <b>heard</b> <b>that</b> resemble deep breathing, unexplained voices and demonic taunting from the game's antagonists.|$|E
