This data is initially subjected to pre-processing and feature extraction and then proceeds with entity extraction. Apart from the conventional stylometric features like prefixes, suffixes, <b>hash</b> <b>tags</b> etc., and POS tags, unsupervised word embedding features obtained from Structured Skip-gram model are utilized to train the system. The extracted features is given to the Support vector machine classifier to build and train model.

We then proceed to propose a statistical model for sentiment detection with side information such as emoticons and <b>hash</b> <b>tags</b> implying tweet polarities being incorporated. Our results show that sentiment analysis based on a simple keyword matching against a sentiment lexicon or a supervised classifier trained with distant supervision does not correlate well with the actual election results.

Due to Twitter's limited searching and lack of navigation support, searching Twitter is not easy and requires effort to find reliable information. This thesis proposed a new methodology to rank tweets based on their authority with the goal of aiding users identifying influential Twitterers.

This method is applied to rank TREC 2011 microblogging dataset which contains over 16 million tweets based on 50 predefined topics.
