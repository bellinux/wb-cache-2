The {{objective}} {{of this research was}} to evaluate the change of physical and chemical properties of peat soil of Jambo Aye Aceh Utara due to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>drainage</b> treatments. The research was set according to randomized completely design with three replication. Pipes of alluminium with length of 100 cm and diameter of 30 cm was used to set the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>drainage</b> treatments. The <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>drainage</b> treatments were: no-drainage, 20 cm, 40 cm, and 60 cm. The results showed the dept of drainage on peat soil affected some of physical and chemical properties of peat soil. From the physical properties point of view, the deeper of drainage was conducted, the more subsidence occurred, otherwise the higher bulk density was occurred. From the chemical properties point of view, the drainage more than 20 cm decreased pH, N-total, P-available, K-exchangeable, and Base Saturated, otherwise increased C-organic, Cation Exchangeable Capacity, and Al-exchangeable. It was recommended to use the drainage depth of 20 cm for controlling the change of some physical and chemical properties of peat soil...|$|E

The {{drainage}} ditch {{is important for}} the plain reservoir, the water table in the dam foundation outside the enclosed dam can be lowered by the ditch, and some leakage water can be pumped from the ditch return to the reservoir. So the design <b>of</b> the <b>drainage</b> ditch {{is the key to the}} plain reservoir. The finite element method is used to investigate the effects of the position, width, depth and the relief well of the ditch on the drainage effects. The results show that the drainage flow is proportional to the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> the <b>drainage</b> ditch, and is inversely proportional to the distance between the ditch and dam, and the relief well can increase the drainage flow and lower the grounder water table...|$|R
40|$|AbstractThe {{greatest}} challenge, {{as far as}} landfill designing is concerned, {{is building}} a <b>drainage</b> system capable <b>of</b> diminishing the most severe negative effect, i. e., groundwater pollution. Based on waste collection system configuration – drainage conditions for existing landfills, <b>drainage</b> <b>of</b> homogeneity, etc. – the present paper managed to determine the hydraulic conductivity <b>of</b> the <b>drainage</b> layer and the maximum <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> saturation. <b>Drainage</b> system effectiveness is highly dependent on efficient analyses of the leachate collection systems. One {{of the most important}} factors of the present study is represented by the maximum saturated <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> infiltration with a net value of 98 cm/year. The hydraulic conductivity determined for this value of net infiltration reveals that, in some cases, the vertical drain leachate drainage is prevalent. The study covered a span of two years. In order to identify groundwater pollution levels in Muntenia region five sampling points were established; their focus was to analyse COD, BOD, pH and TSS values.

40|$|Aggregates of saline-sodic clay {{in three}} size ranges were leached in columns using {{simulated}} rainfall events of varying size, duration and frequency. Aggregate size, {{depth of rainfall}} and duration affected the rate of leaching, although rainfall pattern became more influential as the aggregate size increased. Using the data, a simple empirical model was constructed to predict leaching, using as a basis the cumulative <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>drainage,</b> {{the size of the}} aggregates, the storm duration and the frequency. The model is capable of accurately predicting the quantity of salts leached both under laboratory conditions as well as in mulched restructured topsoils exposed to winter rainfall. However, it overestimated leaching from a topsoil exposed to raindrop impact because of the development of a surface crust which cracked during drying.

40|$|The {{impact of}} tillage and {{nitrogen}} (N) application method on the spatial variation on leaching losses was evaluated using eight, 1 -m 3 undisturbed soil monoliths. Monoliths {{were collected in}} 1992 from research plots with 15 years of continuous tillage and crop rotation history. Tillage practices imposed in the field were moldboard plow, chisel, or ridge tillage. Anion tracers were applied to simulate applying N as a surface broadcast, in a slot with surface compaction, and with water. A rainfall simulator was used to apply 100 mm of water followed 24 h later by an additional application of 430 mm to establish tracer concentrations over a range of drainage. Drainage was collected {{at the bottom of}} each monolith using fiberglass wick extractors placed in a 6 × 6 grid of 90 mm × 90 mm cells. Tracer leaching losses and flow-weighted concentrations were calculated from the initial flush of water through 24 h after water application. No significant differences were noted for cumulative drainage distribution curves or for the <b>depth</b> <b>of</b> <b>drainage</b> produced (p 3 ̆c 0. 05). However, in all cases, the cumulative distribution curves were above the 1 : 1 line, indicating that drainage from some cells was greater than others. Spatial analysis indicated that drainage was randomly distributed across the monolith. Tracer leaching losses were not significantly different among tillage treatments or tracer application methods for either water application event. However, results for the slot with surface compaction treatment suggest that 10 times more NO 3 -N from moldboard plow treatment in comparison with the ridge tillage treatment. Trends in leaching losses for the SLOT (Br) with surface compaction treatment suggested that a tracer leaching pattern existed directly below the application zone. Tracer concentrations peaked above 350 mg L– 1 after 100 to 170 mm of drainage for the SLOT (Br) with surface compaction application method and final concentrations remained above 70 mg L– 1. Peak concentrations for the surface broadcast (BROAD) and with water application (WATER) methods peaked at less than 110 mg L– 1 and were consistent among monoliths. Spatial analysis indicated that leaching losses were randomly distributed. Data supported an assertion that the moldboard plow tillage treatment combined with the slot with surface compaction (SLOT) application of N should be avoided...|$|E

40|$|Underground {{coal mining}} induces de-stressing and {{fracturing}} of strata {{above and below}} the targeted seams. This creates a gas-emission zone, which contains gas-bearing coal seams and strata in the roof and floor of the mined (working) seam. In longwall mining, most of the gas released from the emission zone escapes into the coal face and the goaf (caved-in area) behind the coal face, where it presents a safety issue. Depending on the extent and shape of the emission zone, various gas drainage strategies could be applied to maximise capture of the gas from the emitting seams. We developed and trialled a new method to identify the gas emission zone in the underburden of an underground mine in the Sydney Basin, Australia. In this operation, all coal seams are located below the major targeted seam for mining. By measuring the isotopic and molecular composition of gas desorbed from coal cores from exploration drilling and gas collected from the goaf, we identified the source of gas and quantified the limit of the emission zone in the underburden of the working coal seam. This has allowed drainage to be focused and limited to the required depth.

In addition due to technological advances new trains are increasingly fast. This fact requires an improvement to the construction as well as to maintenance operations of railway systems. Knowledge of applying geophysical sensor techniques on pavements was transferred to railways by taking advantage of the ability of ground penetrating radar to map substructure conditions on a continuous non-destructive basis. The study examines pilot sections, which are integrated in the National Railway System of Greece and are representative of the Greek Railways regarding structural and operational elements. For the present study a Ground Penetrating Radar (GPR) system as well as the Videocar of the National Technical University of Athens have been used. The GPR system consists of an air-coupled 1 GHz frequency antenna and a ground coupled 400 MHz antenna. Data was acquired between concrete and wood ties as well as from the ballast shoulders beyond the ends of the ties, using the two antennas with multiple antenna orientations and polarizations. Automatic processing of the data was developed to quickly generate hard copy sections of radar images. Substructure conditions were observed such as thickness of the ballast and sub ballast layers, variations in layer thickness along the track, pockets of water trapped in the ballast, and soft subgrades from high water content. In addition, locations and <b>depths</b> <b>of</b> subsurface <b>drainage</b> pipes, trenches, and utilities were quickly and continuously mapped.
