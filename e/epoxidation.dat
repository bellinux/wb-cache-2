50|$|Generally, {{nucleophilic}} <b>epoxidations</b> {{are carried}} out under inert atmosphere in anhydrous conditions. For zinc-mediated <b>epoxidations,</b> diethylzinc and ligand are first mixed and oxidized, then the enone is introduced.

5|$|The Johnson–Corey–Chaykovsky {{reaction}} (sometimes {{referred to}} as the Corey–Chaykovsky reaction or CCR) is a chemical reaction used in organic chemistry for the synthesis of epoxides, aziridines, and cyclopropanes. It was discovered in 1961 by A. William Johnson and developed significantly by E. J. Corey and Michael Chaykovsky. The reaction involves addition of a sulfur ylide to a ketone, aldehyde, imine, or enone to produce the corresponding 3-membered ring. The reaction is diastereoselective favoring trans substitution in the product regardless of the initial stereochemistry. The synthesis of epoxides via this method serves as an important retrosynthetic alternative to the traditional <b>epoxidation</b> reactions of olefins.|$|E
25|$|It is {{possible}} to effect reaction {{at one of the}} double bonds selectively. Anhydrous hydrogen chloride reacts preferentially at the disubstituted alkene, whereas <b>epoxidation</b> with mCPBA occurs at the trisubstituted alkene.|$|E
25|$|Alkaline {{hydrogen}} peroxide {{is used for}} <b>epoxidation</b> of electron-deficient alkenes such as acrylic acid derivatives, and for the oxidation of alkylboranes to alcohols, the second step of hydroboration-oxidation. It is also the principal reagent in the Dakin oxidation process.|$|E
50|$|Seleninic acids (particularly areneseleninic acids) {{are useful}} {{catalysts}} for hydrogen peroxide <b>epoxidations,</b> Baeyer-Villiger oxidations, oxidations of thioethers, etc.; peroxyseleninic acids (RSe(O)OOH) {{are thought to}} be the active oxidants.|$|R
50|$|Although it is {{the least}} {{reactive}} metal catalyst for <b>epoxidations,</b> vanadium is highly selective for alkenes with allylic alcohols. Early work done by Sharpless shows its preference for reacting with alkenes with allylic alcohols over more substituted electron dense alkenes. In this case, Vanadium showed reverse regioselectivity from both m-CPBA and the more reactive molybdenum species. Although vanadium is generally less reactive than other metal complexes, {{in the presence of}} allylic alcohols, the rate of the reaction is accelerated beyond that of molybdenum, the most reactive metal for <b>epoxidations.</b>|$|R
50|$|Homoallylic {{alcohols}} {{are effective}} directing groups for <b>epoxidations</b> in both cyclic and acyclic systems for substrates which show hydrogen bonding. However these reactions {{tend to have}} lower levels of selectivity.|$|R
25|$|Alkenes {{react in}} many {{addition}} reactions, which occur by {{opening up the}} double-bond. Most of these addition reactions follow the mechanism of electrophilic addition. Examples are hydrohalogenation, halogenation, halohydrin formation, oxymercuration, hydroboration, dichlorocarbene addition, Simmons–Smith reaction, catalytic hydrogenation, <b>epoxidation,</b> radical polymerization and hydroxylation.|$|E
25|$|Based {{on their}} reactivity, another {{distinct}} {{advantage of these}} two variants is that kinetically they provide a difference in diastereoselectivity. The reaction is very well established, and enantioselective variants (catalytic and stoichiometric) have also been achieved. From a retrosynthetic analysis standpoint, this reaction provides a reasonable alternative to conventional <b>epoxidation</b> reactions with alkenes (scheme 22). Danishefsky utilized this methodology for the synthesis of taxol. Diastereoselectivity is established by 1,3 interactions in the transition state required for epoxide closure.|$|E
25|$|Another {{approach}} to construct catalytically active homochiral MOFs is to incorporate chiral metal complexes which are either active catalysts or precatalysts {{directly into the}} framework structures. For example, Hupp and coworkers have combined a chiral ligand and bpdc (bpdc: biphenyldicarboxylate) with Zn(NO3)2 and obtained twofold interpenetrating 3D networks. The orientation of chiral ligand in the frameworks makes all Mn(III) sites accessible through the channels. The resulting open frameworks showed catalytic activity towards asymmetric olefin <b>epoxidation</b> reactions. No significant decrease of catalyst activity was observed during the reaction and the catalyst could be recycled and reused several times. Lin and coworkers have reported zirconium phosphonate-derived Ru-BINAP systems. Zirconium phosphonate-based chiral porous hybrid materials containing the Ru(BINAP)(diamine)Cl2 precatalysts showed excellent enantioselectivity (up to 99.2% ee) in the asymmetric hydrogenation of aromatic ketones.|$|E

25|$|A Shapiro {{reaction}} of the vinyllithium compound derived from hydrazone 4.1 with aldehyde 4.2 makes the first connection that will become the B ring. The control of stereochemistry in 4.3 {{is thought to be}} derived from the relative hindrance of the Si face in the orientation shown on the right, due to the proximity of the axial methyl group. <b>Epoxidation</b> with vanadyl(acetylacetate) converted alkene 4.3 to epoxide 4.4, which, upon reduction with lithium aluminium hydride, gave diol 4.5. This diol was then protected as carbonate ester 4.6. The carbonate group also served to create rigidity in the ring structure for the imminent pinacol coupling reaction. The two silyl ether groups were removed, and diol 4.7 was then oxidized to give dialdehyde 4.8 using N-methylmorpholine N-oxide {{in the presence of a}} catalytic amount of tetrapropylammonium perruthenate. In the final step of the formation of Ring B, a pinacol coupling using conditions developed by McMurry (titanium(III) chloride and a zinc/copper alloy) gave diol 4.9.|$|E

2500|$|Within the cell, vitamin K {{undergoes}} electron reduction to {{a reduced}} form called vitamin K hydroquinone, catalyzed by the enzyme vitamin K epoxide reductase (VKOR).

The carboxylation reaction only proceeds if the carboxylase enzyme {{is able to}} oxidize vitamin K hydroquinone to vitamin K epoxide at the same time.

2500|$|In {{the later}} {{half of the}} twentieth century, chemists began to develop methods of {{stereoselective}} catalysis and kinetic resolution whereby reactions could be directed to produce only one enantiomer rather than a racemic mixture. Early examples include stereoselective hydrogenations (e.g., as reported by William Knowles and Ryōji Noyori, and functional group modifications such as the asymmetric <b>epoxidation</b> of Barry Sharpless; for these specific [...] achievements, these workers were awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry in 2001. Such reactions gave chemists a much wider choice of enantiomerically pure molecules to start from, where previously only natural starting materials could be used. Using techniques pioneered by Robert B. Woodward and new developments in synthetic methodology, chemists became more able to take simple molecules through to more complex molecules without unwanted racemisation, by understanding stereocontrol, allowing final target molecules to be synthesised pure enantiomers (i.e., without need for resolution).
