A ?load-varying? self-propulsion method was used, allowing for calculations without the need for results from a resistance test. Still water, regular and irregular wave conditions have been tested. The vessel model used, M 3030 A, was originally used to test the Mewis Duct in still water. Results in still water have been compared to the original test results. Deviations from the original tests have been found, which could be due to increased resistance of the model and bias in the tow force and thrust measurements. Results in regular waves show a consistent increase in the effective wake with the Mewis Duct fitted, but the thrust deduction contains a high amount of scatter. This results in scatter in the <b>hull</b> <b>efficiency,</b> and further in the propulsive efficiency.

The {{successful}} use of hydrofoil {{systems on}} catamarans, {{such as the}} Hysucat, {{led to the development}} of a similar foil system for a high speed trimaran. Firstly a mathematical model was developed to calculate the equilibrium planing conditions of a planing trimaran. This was then used in the hydrodynamic design of a fully planing trimaran with a design speed of 65 kn. The mathematical model was then modified to include the effects of added hydrofoils. This model was then used to design a hydrofoil support system for the planing trimaran. Towing tank tests were then performed on a scale model of the boat, with and without the supporting hydrofoil system. This was done to verify the theoretical design and to gather resistance data, which could then be compared to other boats. The results showed a notable improvement in efficiency of the boat with the addition of foils. The conclusion was made that with the addition of a well-designed foil system, <b>hull</b> <b>efficiencies</b> similar to that expected for the Hysucat, can be attained when the foil system is added to the trimaran. As this work was focused mainly on the high-speed performance of the boat, it is not certain how the boat will perform through the speed-range.

40|$|The good {{seakeeping}} {{characteristics of}} SWATH hull form are very interesting for small working craft and pleasure boats. Intrinsic limitations as the low values of weight per inch of immersion and transversal and longitudinal instability, can be acceptable and successfully managed when the mission profile does {{not ask for}} significant load variation and shift. The exploitation of SWATH concept {{is limited by the}} craft size, but if main dimensions allow enough static stability, this configuration appears very promising. SWATH behaviour in rough sea at zero and low speed have led to consider this hull form within the small craft design research program in progress at University of Naples Federico II. The design of small size SWATH working/pleasure craft has to begin from the consideration of strut waterplane areas that are the key factor to get acceptable static and dynamic stability. Displacement has to be reduced as most as possible to increase static stability, as shown by last design trends. The results of CFD analysis concerning SWATH resistance and propulsion, aspects are presented.

The ITTC 78 method has been validated against the sea trials {{over more than}} 35 years and is very adapted to the conventional propellers. However, new type of propellers such as Kappel propeller seem to challenge the traditional method, in particular with wake scaling. Suspicions have been raised that the standard methods for evaluation of the model tests might give misleading results for Kappel propeller [1]. This report presents a comparative study in {{various aspects of the}} performance of a conventional propeller with an unconventional propeller (Kappel propeller). The study is carried out using OpenFOAM RANS solver for computing the viscous flow around a ship hull, propellers in open-water and propellers behind the hull. The numerical results are validated by comparing with the model scale experiments performed at SSPA. Further the computations are extended to full scale and the sources of scaling effects are identified. The differences in scaling between the conventional and unconventional propellers are examined and further this relative differences are compared with that of ITTC 78 scaling method. The correlation of CFD results with the experimental study justify the accuracy of the CFD setup in predicting the complex flow between hull and propeller. In full scale the CFD results show a larger Reynolds scaling effect on the unconventional propeller compared with the conventional propeller in open-water condition. The scaling effects on various full scale performance factors such as the effective wake fraction, thrust deduction, hull and total efficiencies are evaluated for the propellers behind the hull using CFD and compared with the full scale estimations from ITTC 78 method. At the design condition the CFD study estimates the unconventional propeller has much lower effective wake and <b>hull</b> <b>efficiency.</b> However the propeller and total efficiencies are higher for unconventional propeller. The CFD estimations in full scale contradict the estimations from the ITTC 78 method.

This study uses data envelopment analysis to evaluate the efficiency of selected Illinois high schools. Sixty-one Illinois high schools were selected based on common structural characteristics. Data for school years 1996 - 1997 to 2000 - 2001 from the Illinois High School Report Card and the National Center for Education Statistics were analyzed. Discretionary and non-discretionary input variables were considered. The impact of these input variables on school outcomes was systematically analyzed. Data envelopment analysis simultaneously evaluates multiple inputs and multiple outputs to establish a convex <b>hull</b> <b>efficiency</b> frontier that envelops all data points for the schools. Those falling inside the convex hull are considered inefficient. The variable returns to scale model with four non-discretionary variables was selected to analyze the school data. Results showed that in general the high schools in the sample were relatively efficient given the environmental conditions under which they operated. However, some of their outputs may not be ideal, representing further room for improvement. For the schools that were deemed inefficient, closer scrutiny showed that they {{would have been able to}} produce the same level of outputs using lower combinations of inputs. Window analysis identified the schools that showed relatively constant efficiency throughout the study period, those whose efficiency dropped after the first year and those whose efficiency dropped at the last year. These results have policy implications. Those officials responsible for allocating resources may want to take a closer look at the schools that were deemed inefficient and require them to reexamine the management of their resources. At the same time, those schools that are already performing efficiently given their resources should also be examined. Some of the schools that were deemed efficient but are not performing up to par could potentially raise the level of their outputs if they could be allocated more resources. Data envelopment analysis will be useful for policy makers and school officials when making decisions in the allocation of state resources and demanding accountability for the use of those resources. For each school, specific outputs or inputs can be examined to determine which inputs need adjustments or which outputs could still be raised...|$|E

40|$|In {{the last}} few years, {{remarkable}} improvements in numerical modeling of viscous flows around marine propellers have been obtained. In particular, Reynolds Averaged Navier-Stokes (RANS) equation solvers start to be widely used to analyze viscosity effects on propulsors at model-scale Reynolds number, {{in the case of}} uniform inflow and non-cavitating conditions. The development of such advanced computational tools is required, especially in modern propeller design, where for reducing propeller-induced <b>hull</b> vibrations, <b>efficiency</b> decay and noise generation due to cavitation, there is a continuous trend towards an increased complexity of the blade geometry, primarily due to the low aspect ratio and to the skew of marine propellers, which cause strong three-dimensional effects. This complexity requires a better knowledge of the wake characteristics in terms of the mean field and turbulent quantities. Therefore, there is a rising interest on detailed data of the velocity flow field around the blades and in the wake, supporting the flow modeling and the validation of the computational tools. Starting since 1997 at INSEAN started a project aimed to obtain high quality data for CFD validation. Measurements of velocity fields, radiated pressure fields cavitation patterns were performed.

40|$|Biofouling is the {{accumulation}} of sessile marine organisms, such as algae, tube worms and barnacles on man-made substrata and has negative economic and ecological implications. Ship hulls are readily fouled, which significantly increases drag while decreasing ship fuel efficiency when moving through water. Fouled hulls have also become important vectors of invasive species. These problems are minimized when hulls are painted with a toxic anti-fouling or non-toxic foul-release coating. Due to recent restrictions of anti-fouling paint use, {{research and development of}} non-toxic alternatives has increased. Novel <b>hull</b> coating <b>efficiency</b> is often quantified by the critical removal stress value of barnacles from the coating. Barnacle adhesive cement protein content is thought to be responsible for barnaclesâ incredible ability to adhere underwater. The expression level and type of adhesive proteins has eluded scientists due to their extreme insolubility within cured barnacle cement. Identification of these proteins may provide insight to the adhesion of fouling species and aid coating development. Barnacles are a cosmopolitan organism, able to withstand a wide range of environmental conditions, yet foul-release coating research had not previously incorporated environmental factors as variables in determining coating performance. Temperature is known to affect protein structure and function and is also a formative factor of barnacle larvae survival and development. Even so, the interaction between temperature and barnacle adhesion to has not previously been explored. We examined the effect of temperature on barnacle adhesion to foul-release coatings. After observing differences in critical removal stress due to temperature, we attempted to attribute these differences to specific proteins within the adhesive using 2 D SDS PAGE. Gel image analysis determined that there were significant differences in cement protein expression between barnacles raised within different temperatures. Preliminary protein identification with Mass Spectronomy (MALDI TOF/TOF) was performed, however further research and a larger barnacle genomic database is needed to elucidate barnacle cement protein sequences...|$|R
40|$|The globalized market enforces a great cost {{pressure}} {{on all the}} shipbuilding actors. Norwegian yards, representing countries with high local wages and prices, is under pressure to make changes {{if they want to}} keep up with the competition. Historically, ship owners have been willing to pay the extra price for Norwegian ships, given the reputation of good quality and deliverability, but this could change in the near future. Asian shipyards are becoming more skilled at building increasingly complex vessels. They have access to low-cost labour, and can usually offer a better price on the ships compared to Norwegian designs and builds. The overall goal of this thesis is to investigate if modern automation technology can be applied in hull building to increase efficiency, and level the labour-cost differences between high labour-cost countries and low labour-cost countries. The framework for the thesis is a semi-integrated yard in a high labour-cost country who buys completed hulls abroad and now wish to make a strategic move towards becoming a fully integrated yard, performing more of their own steel work. The hypothesis is that it will be too expensive to hire manual labour to perform the vast amount of construction work needed to complete a hull. It is a very labour-heavy task, and getting a large enough qualified workforce can prove difficult. The aim is to investigate if modern automation technology can be a viable investment to reach the goal of taking back more steel work of the hull production. The focus will be on identifying realistic operations to automate, and investigate what impact it has on the production efficiency. A literature review focusing on the hull building process and modern automation technology identified several intelligent robotic configurations that could potentially increase the <b>hull</b> building <b>efficiency,</b> as well as eliminating the hazards associated with manual work task operation. In later years, the larger Asian yards have focused on building specialized robots for application at the shipyards. Although prototypical, they show great test results. To evaluate the different elements affecting the investment decision regarding automation technology, a model is developed. The model can be used as a tool in the quantitative decision-making between the two options: invest in automation technology to make own hulls, or keep buying hulls abroad. The model depicts simple calculations that shed light on where the largest potential for improvement through automation lies, and whether or not the investment pays off over time. It consist of six basic steps: ï· Step 1 : Establish case data ï· Step 2 : Map process time consumption ï· Step 3 : Perform maximum investment calculations ï· Step 4 : Evaluate investment by Net Present Value ï· Step 5 : Sensitivity analysis ï· Step 6 : Scenario weighting with Quantitative Strategic Planning Matrix Each step builds from the preceding step and applies the newly retrieved information into the next analysis. The model is applied to a case study to test its validity. The case study is based on key figures publically available, as well as some qualified estimates. This study focus on the building of semi-advanced Platform Supply Vessels with a typical length of 75 - 90 meters, breadth of 17 - 20 meters and 3500 tons of steel weight. The case study yard can manage a throughput of four vessels of this kind each year. The results from applying the model to the case study shows that modern automation technology can contribute to an increase in the <b>hull</b> building <b>efficiency.</b> This increased efficiency result in valuable time saved, and justifies a substantial investment in automation technology for each of the stages described in the hull building process. In addition to increasing efficiency, the automation technology introduce several advantages that cannot be measured directly in monetary values. These elements are crucial to include in the decision-making process, as they can affect the long-term reputation of the given yard.

There is an increasing interest in the use of long range/long duration Unmanned Undersea Vehicles (UUVs) for littoral observation, military surveillance and river search missions. Existing UUVs are commonly torpedo-shaped and exhibit poor maneuverability, especially in shallow areas. Small rotary propellers driven by electric motors almost universally power these UUVs; the energy for which is stored in either rechargeable or one-shot batteries depending on the vehicle and its mission.

Therefore, many methods for shape representation exist in the literature. One of the techniques for shape {{representation is}} based on convex hull. The convex hull of a shape is the smallest polygon that positions the entire points of the input shape within the polygon [1].

The problem with these early-introduced algorithms is their low computational efficiency because of the involvement of sorting process of the input points. Sorting the input points consumes O(n log n) running time and it is less memory efficient, as it requires an extra temporary array. After the sorting process, the algorithm employs a stack-based method to form the convex hull, which runs in just O(n) time...|$|R
40|$|The {{high cost}} of fuel and the {{demanding}} regulations against {{the environmental impact of}} using fossil fuels are now encouraging new and more radical solutions {{when it comes to the}} propulsion systems of a ship. One possible way is to move the propeller aft behind the hull. This allows the propeller diameter to increase without risks of pressure pulses being transferred to the hull. An increase in efficiency may then be achieved, reducing environmental impacts and cost. This is referred to as the large area propeller (LAP) concept and is investigated in this paper. The CFD software SHIPFLOW with a zonal approach (RANS, potential flow and boundary layer methods) is used, and the propeller is represented by a lifting line method. The original propeller and a larger one are systematically moved aft, and the delivered power, as well as the propulsive coefficients, are computed. 	Results	are	compared with experimental data from SSPA. The results indicate a large reduction in delivered power both in CFD and EFD by moving the propeller aft and increasing the diameter by 22. 7 %. Compared to the original configuration, the reduction is around 10 % in EFD and 14 % in CFD; however, the trends are well captured in CFD. There is thus a large gain in total efficiency mainly due to increased <b>hull</b> and propeller	<b>efficiencies,</b>	even	though	no modifications of the hull and propellers were done to further improve the concept.

40|$|This thesis {{explores the}} {{interaction}} of numerous factors affecting economic productivity in Englandâs 17 th-century tobacco trade with its Chesapeake colonies, particularly {{with an eye to}} transatlantic shipping. This is achieved here {{through the use of a}} network inspired analytical framework to provide an assessment of a range of elements surrounding the trade over the course of the 17 th century, how these elements interacted, and the degree to which they affected the overall productivity tobacco market. Data used to these means include the extant body of relevant literature, historical documentation, archaeological data, and a case study of an archaeological site near St. Maryâs City, Maryland, USA investigated for the purpose of this thesis. The tobacco economy is examined and analysed based on various inputs, along with various social and political factors. Settlement patterning is studied through geo-spatial archaeological data from Maryland to identify possible causes for the shift in the tobacco collection model from a plantation-front based system to a central warehouse model. Through this, it is argued that the dominant driver for this change was a spread of plantations to more inland sites owing to population growth as the dominant cause. Shipbuilding is scrutinised to identify trends in ship technology and construction methods, showing changes to be both purpose and resource driven. Passenger journals and logbooks are used to examine changes in sailing route throughout the 17 th century from England to the Chesapeake, resulting in the identification of a previously unknown route of ocean passage in common usage in the latter half of the 17 th century. This change provided generally faster crossings on a less hazardous route, necessitated largely by political and social causes. Making use of these same voyage accounts as a data source, a quantitative study of English merchant ship performance in terms of velocity made good and windward sailing capabilities is provided. Results of this study indicate that advances in ocean crossing times were largely route dependent, with little if any advance in sailing speed over this period. Lastly, the examination of a submerged ballast cluster has provided insights into possible focusses of maritime archaeology in the Chesapeake region. To date, no vessels dating to the early colonial period have been located in the region despite heavy maritime traffic in this era. Ballast discard sites dating to this period are a common yet virtually unexamined site type for this area, and should be afforded additional attention. In sum, this thesis provides a detailed overview of the function of the English-Chesapeake tobacco trade, resulting in a series of network-based models of interaction examining foreign and domestic politics, crew size and mariner wages, tobacco production, the tobacco market, product collection models, sailing routes, <b>hull</b> and sail <b>efficiency,</b> ship construction, time spent at sea, and time spent in port. These are assessed on a temporal scale, allowing for summary of the function of the tobacco economy at various points throughout the 17 th century and into the 18 th century...|$|R
