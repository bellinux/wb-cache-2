5|$|From 1793, seven small {{houses at}} {{the east side of}} the theatre {{fronting}} on the Haymarket were demolished and replaced by a large concert room. It was <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> that Joseph Haydn gave a series of concerts, under the sponsorship of Johann Peter Salomon, on his second visit to London in 1794–95. He presented his own symphonies, some of them premieres, conducted by himself, and was paid £50 each for 20 concerts. He was feted in London and returned to Vienna in May 1795 with 12,000florins.|$|E
5|$|The {{centerpiece}} of the Lincoln Room is a portrait of Abraham Lincoln painted by 19th-century American portraitist Edward Dalton Marchant; {{it is one of}} a number of drawings, paintings, and photographs of Lincoln used to decorate this room. The sitting room in the Blair House wing of the complex was originally used by the Blair family to receive U.S. presidents. <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> in 1861, Montgomery Blair, acting on Lincoln's orders, offered the command of the Union Army to Robert E. Lee, an offer that Lee declined.|$|E
5|$|Manager Malcolm McLaren asked {{architect}} Ben Kelly {{to refurbish}} a basement rehearsal room {{he had bought}} from Badfinger. The Sex Pistols rehearsed <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room,</b> lived above No. 6, and recorded their first demos there. Johnny Rotten drew cartoons of the members as graffiti which was later revealed in an archaeological survey of the site. Scott Gorham bought his first guitar with Thin Lizzy on Denmark Street. He had turned up at the audition with a Japanese Les Paul Copy—when he got the job, Phil Lynott took him shopping on Denmark Street. After being told several guitars were too expensive, he settled on a Sunburst Gibson Les Paul Deluxe. Andy's Guitars was established in 1978 at No. 27 and survived for many years before closing in 2007 because of increased shop rates.|$|E

5|$|The {{most notable}} {{of the many}} rooms are the state apartments. These were laid out from the 16th century onwards, and were {{enhanced}} {{in the style of}} those at Versailles during the 18th century. In the 19th century and again during the late 20th century, large-scale restoration of the state rooms consolidated the 18th-century style which prevails today. Designed as an enfilade and a ceremonial route to the throne room, the processional route begins with an external horseshoe-shaped staircase which leads from the court of honour to the open gallery known as the Gallery of Hercules. From here guests enter the Mirror Gallery, a long hall inspired by the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles. This gallery leads to the first of the state rooms, the Officer's Room, where guests are greeted by court officials before an audience with the prince in the Throne Room. From the Officer's Hall the enfilade continues to the Blue Room. This large drawing room, decorated with blue brocade, is hung with Grimaldi family portraits and has chandeliers of Murano glass. The following room, the largest of the state apartments, is the Throne Room. Its ceiling and frescoes were executed by Orazio de Ferrari and depict the surrender of Alexander the Great. The throne, in the Empire style, is positioned on a dais, beneath a red silk canopy of estate surmounted by a gilt crown. The floors are of Carrara marble. All state ceremonies have been held <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> since the 16th century.|$|E
25|$|The Corner Room: The ceiling <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room,</b> {{representing}} {{the conversion of}} Saint Paul, was painted by Luca Giordano. The walls of the room are covered in red damask and adorned with small paintings by, among others, Rubens and Andrea del Sarto.|$|E
25|$|The Little Ante Room: The {{white marble}} {{fireplace}} <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room,</b> with inserts of black marble, {{is almost certainly}} by Inigo Jones. The panels in the ceiling were painted by Lorenzo Sabbatini (1530–1577) and therefore are far older than {{this part of the}} house; again there are paintings by Van Dyck and Teniers.|$|E

25|$|Its Long Dining Room houses 12 of the 13 celebrated 17th-century {{paintings}} in the series Jacob and his twelve sons, by Francisco de Zurbarán, depicting Jacob and his 12 sons. These paintings have hung for 250 years <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> specifically designed and constructed for them. In 2001 the Church Commissioners voted to sell the works of art, then estimated at £20m in value, but relented after a review in 2010.|$|E
25|$|Some of {{the more}} {{relevant}} pieces are {{on display in the}} following Room 5 (Arts Room), which is dedicated to the “Books for music and instruments of the 16th and 17th centuries.” <b>In</b> <b>this</b> <b>room,</b> rare texts from ranging the 15th century to the famous Harmonice Musices Odhecaton A, the first printed musical book by Ottaviano Petrucci, can be admired. They are kept inside very modern, circular cases {{in the center of the}} room, which match the rich decoration of the floors.|$|E
25|$|I am {{neither a}} prophet, nor {{the son of}} a prophet, yet I will venture to predict that in five years we shall make the journey hence to Quebec and Montreal, and home through Portland and St. John, by rail; and I believe that many <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> will live to hear the whistle of the steam engine in the passes of the Rocky Mountains, and to make the journey from Halifax to the Pacific in five or six days.|$|E

25|$|Room 2 is {{dedicated}} to the concepts of ritual and sacrifice <b>in</b> Tenochtitlan. <b>This</b> <b>room</b> contains urns where dignitaries where interred, funerary offerings, as well as objects associated with self and human sacrifice—such as musical instruments, knives and skulls.|$|R
25|$|The Green Drawing Room {{is between}} the Octagon Drawing room and the new kitchen. It had always {{previously}} {{been used as a}} breakfast room or small dining room, less formal than the Dining Room itself. When the National Trust took over management of the house, the room was refurnished and displayed as a drawing room. The room has a moulded plaster neoclassical ceiling and is hung with green silk which was formerly curtains at Englefield House, Berkshire. The white marble fireplace <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> {{is one of the few}} original to the house.|$|E
25|$|The {{most famous}} {{spaces in the}} house are those {{at the rear of}} the museum – the Dome Area, Colonnade and Museum Corridor. These are mostly toplit and provide some idea in {{miniature}} form of the ingenious lighting contrived by Soane for the toplit banking halls at the Bank of England. The ingeniously designed Picture Gallery has walls composed of large 'moveable planes' (like large cupboard doors) that allow it to house three times as many items as a space of this size could normally accommodate (the original hang <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> was reinstated in January 2011). When visiting, it is necessary to request the planes to be opened and wait for a group to gather before this is done.|$|E
25|$|The Breakfast Parlour Now {{called the}} Chandos Sigma Dormitory. It is {{immediately}} {{to the east of}} the Blue Room dating from 1773 to 1775. This is a relatively plain room. The ceiling is coved, centre of the ceiling is decorated with a circular painting of Venus blindfolding Cupid surrounded by plaster decoration that includes incense burners. The marble fireplace dated 1774 with its relief of Venus and Cupid was sold in 1922. There used to be 39 paintings <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room,</b> including Virgin and Child with SS John the Baptist and Catherine, dated 1504 by Andrea Previtali this is now in the National Gallery, London and Woman at her Toilette once attributed to Leonardo da Vinci and bought as such in 1780, now School of Fontainebleau, this is in the Worcester Art Museum, Massachusetts.|$|E

50|$|Tower room — Structurally, {{the house}} was {{constructed}} around a large central tower that contained an attic <b>room.</b> <b>In</b> 1796, <b>this</b> <b>room</b> was used temporarily to house Barnabas Collins' coffin. In 1897, Judith Collins Trask housed the crazed Jenny (wife of Quentin) there.|$|R
25|$|Room 1, a 5m square {{room was}} also excavated. The upper levels {{revealed}} ceramic sherds, cloth fragments, and domestic refuse suggesting a mixed use during occupation. A small central hearth was found beneath. One {{of the rooms}} had two short pillars or columns conjoined to opposite walls. A skeleton of an immature bird, small fish vertebrae, and crab were found as well. A large quantity of bird guano, avian skeletal material, and feathers {{were found in the}} lower layers but no associated remains of nesting boxes or other structures indicating aviculture. However, the abundance does indicate that birds were important at this site in either a ritual, production or consumption context. Other artifacts found <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> also included cotton, wool, needles and nine adobe bricks. The mix of artifact types suggests multiple activity patterns.|$|E
25|$|Sala do Corpo Diplomático (Diplomatic Corp's Room), {{was used}} for visiting ambassadors {{and members of the}} {{diplomatic}} corp, who waited <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> before being presented in the throne room. This room is full of classical motifs, presenting a ceiling with animals, figures and chariots, based on a Greek frieze, with painted walls and inlaid parquet floor. Three of the walls have tapestries with royal coats of arms and the last with a fireplace surmounted by mirror, with chairs assembled for the gathered visitors, all accented in red velvet and gold, and two large ornamental vases. Alongside is a small antechamber used so that visitors could wait as their name was presented to the monarchs, before appearing in the throne room. On the walls of this room are portraits of John VI of Portugal and Carlota Joaquina on opposite walls.|$|E
25|$|When in 1684 Louis XIV {{moved into}} the {{adjacent}} room to the south (the chambre du roi), this central room behind {{the facade of the}} avant-corps was designated as the salon du roi or the salon où le roi s’habille ("the room in which the king dresses"). For 17 years, it served as venue for the ceremonies that surrounded the life of the king, such as the lever and the coucher. When the chambre de Louis XIV was established in 1701, the archways to the Hall of Mirrors were sealed off, and the room became the ideological as well as physical focal point of the palace. The king died <b>in</b> <b>this</b> <b>room</b> on 1September 1715. Later, Louis XV and Louis XVI would continue to use it for the lever and the coucher. On 6 October 1789, Louis XVI, Marie Antoinette, and the Dauphin appeared on the balcony before the mob that forced the royal family to move from Versailles to the Tuileries Palace in Paris.|$|E
